 THE HISTORY OF  The Robinhood Society  IN WHICH THE ORIGIN OF THAT ILLUSTRIOUS BODY of MEN is traced The Method of managing their DEBATES is shewn The MEMOIRS of the various Members that compose it are given And some ORIGINAL SPEECHES as Specimens of their Oratorical Abilities are recorded Chiefly compiled from Original Papers  I will a round unvarnish'd Tale deliver  nothing extenuate  Nor set down aught in Malice  SHAKESPEARE  LONDON Printed for JAMES FLETCHER and Co at the  Oxford Theatre  in  St Paul's ChurchYard  MDCCLXIV  TO THE Truly Honourable and Highly Respectable BODY of MEN CALLED  The Robinhood Society  THIS HISTORY WITH The most perfect ADMIRATION of Their UNRIVALLED ABILITIES AND With the Profoundest Respect Is most submissively DEDICATED BY  The Author  TO THE PUBLIC  S  EVERAL Pamphlets having from Time to Time been published concerning the RO∣BINHOOD SOCIETY some in Vindication of it and others against it the public At∣tention has been awakened and many have desired to know the  Origin of this Society and to be acquainted with its Proceed∣ings from it first Formation to its present State But no Work hitherto printed has related these Particulars Indeed they have all been so remarkably silent on these Heads that like the brave  Irishman  who born of a com∣mon Prostitute and unable to learn who was his real Father concluded he had none at all many People imagine either that this Society had no Origin or that it is so obscure and uncer∣tain that no Traces of it can now be discovered  BUT this is a Mistake A true and impartial Review of these  Particulars may be expected in these Memoirs and it is not doubted but it will amply gratify the Curiosity of the Reader If he desires to know from whence these Materials have been drawn I shall inform him that they were from Manuscripts of my Grandfather and Father the for∣mer of whom was not only a Member but the Promoter of  "THE SOCIETIE FOR FREE AND CANDYD ENQUIRIE"  for so were they at first called and in∣deed they have retained the Title ever since  AS to the History of the Mem∣bers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY for that indeed is intirely  my own Work I have been obli∣ged to no one for Anecdotes but to the Members themselves and I have with no small Pains and Industry as well as Time and Expence collected from them such Accounts as the Reader will here meet with Indeed in a Work of this Nature some Anec∣dotes not founded on Facts must be expected Anecdotes invented by the Envy or Vanity of the Relater But it is hoped the Number of these is but few For the Author or rather Compiler has when he suspected the Truth of any Relation not contented himself with having something new to say as too many of our Biographers and HistoryWriters  do but has made the most dili∣gent Enquiries of different People to whom the several Members were intimately known and some as Schoolfellows and from them he has learnt their real  Parentage  and  Education Life Character  and  Behaviour  So that in gene∣ral these Memoirs may be deem∣ed as authentic and genuine as perhaps any that have been ever given to the World though they may not be so gaudily dressed  THE Speeches I have given on different Subjects as Specimens of the Members Abilities are in the strict Sense of the Word  Original  for they were taken  down in ShortHand at the very Time they were spoken  THE Reader may now discern what he has to expect in this Work And without the Im∣putation of Vanity I think I may affirm that the Public will be both instructed and entertained in the Perusal of it The ROBINHOOD SOCIETY has of late greatly at∣tracted the Notice of the World and is now so much frequented that almost every  Monday  Night Numbers are robbed of the En∣tertainment they expect because it is so crowded that no more can be admitted  TO those who have often at∣tended the Society and are ac∣quainted with the Nature of it the Author of these Memoirs ap∣peals for a Character of Candour and Impartiality and he is confi∣dent they will allow that his De∣scription of the Debates is true and faithful his Portraits of the Members just and striking and the Speeches he has selected au∣thentic and  original  HE will only add farther con∣cerning this Work that he be∣lieves no other MSS but those he has in his Possession containing the Origin of the Society and its Proceedings till it was re∣moved  to the  ButcherRow  are now extant  AS then no other Person is able to trace the Original of the Soci∣ety and relate its Progress for no less a Term than Years for so long it has subsisted he doubts not but his  complete History  will favourably be received  THE HISTORY OF THE  Robinhood Society  T  HE  English  have been cha∣racterised by many ingenious Foreigners as a People that delight greatly in Clubs and Assemblies which they im∣pute to a social and goodnatured Dispo∣sition and to a Love of Science It is owing to this Disposition and to this af∣fection for Knowledge that there is scarce a Town or Village in our Kingdom but  what has its Clubs or Places of nocturnal Entertainment where after the Fatigues of the Day Men of various Occupations in Life meet to dissipate the Gloom which has been spread by Study or any intense Application and by a mutual Commu∣nication of Sentiment either in Flashes of Wit or solid Argument to improve their Judgments and entertain their Imagi∣nations  SUCH is the favourable Point of View in which judicious Foreigners behold our natural Propensity of forming and fre∣quenting Clubs and such their Description of the good Effects resulting from them  BUT I am afraid that though some Clubs produce these Effects the Genera∣rality of them produce the Reverse and may be deemed Receptacles for the Idle and the Dissolute where Modesty is thrown aside like their Great Coats and where Impiety Obscenity and Li∣centiousness prevail to the greatest Degree where a Love of Laziness and an Aversion to honest Industry are contracted where the keeping ill Hours is encouraged to the great Detriment of Individuals and to the Prejudice of the Community and  where in short no useful Subject em∣ploys their Thoughts or Tongues but mere Noise and Nonsense obscene Songs or Tales and large Draughts of Liquor form their Savage Happiness  BUT however true this Description may be of Clubs in general it cannot be said that the particular Kind of Club re∣sembling that of the ROBINHOOD is of their Nature or produces their Effects Those are  Drinking Clubs  this is a  Dis∣puting  one At those Places Men meet to feed their Bodies at this they assemble to feed their Minds At those Intoxi∣cation is very frequent at this very rare I could heighten the Contrast but it is needless The Perusal of these Sheets will sufficiently acquaint the Reader with the Nature and Tendency of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY and of Disputing Clubs in general and therefore without striving to biass his Judgment or preclude his Re∣marks by any of my own I shall proceed to my Account of  "THE SOCIETY FOR FREE AND CANDID ENQUIRY"  from its infant State to its present mature Growth at the ROBINHOOD and LITTLE JOHN in  ButcherRow  IN the Year when that fine Piece of Work equally honourable and useful the  New River  was completed Sir HUGH MYDDLETON who had a great Affection and Regard for my Grandfather WIL∣LIAM G********  Esq  being in Com∣pany with him one Day lamented it as a great Infelicity and a vast Obstruction of human Knowledge that light and trivial Subjects alone generally found Admittance into polite Companies while important and weighty ones were excluded My Grandfather acquiesced with him in Sen∣timents and proposed it as his Opinion that a Society might be formed to consist of a certain Number of Gentlemen of li∣beral Education and acquired Accomplish∣ments to meet Weekly at some conve∣nient Room to discourse on Subjects that would contribute to their mutual Instruc∣tion and Entertainment Sir HUGH de∣clared it was a lucky Suggestion and he would think of it at Leisure and let him know his Opinion of the Practicability of putting such a Scheme into Execution the next Time he saw him  THE Intimacy that had for many Years subsisted between Sir HUGH and my Grand∣father  would not permit their being ab∣sent for any considerable Time after this Meeting and the Starting of a Subject which had such Charms for both My Grandfather was a good Speaker and no bad Writer In the juvenile Part of his Life he had been engaged in mercantile Business in a very extensive Manner and conducting his Affairs with Skill and Pru∣dence for about sevenandtwenty Years he had amassed no less a Sum than fortyseven thousand Pounds with which con∣trary to a great Number of Merchants being contented he retired from Business and lived on the Interest of his Fortune As to Sir HUGH he was a Man of ex∣treme good natural Parts heightened and embellished by the Acquisition of the use∣ful and ornamental Parts of Learning and having at the Expence of the greatest Part of an opulent Fortune completed his darling Project of bringing Water from  Ware  through various Turnings and Windings to  London  thereby supplying that great Metropolis with one of the greatest Necessaries of Life he had now Leisure to consider of other Employ∣ments and partake of other Amusements not less suited to his Taste and for which he was not less qualified At the Meet∣ing  my Grandfather and Sir HUGH had at the oldest Tavern in  London  the  Lon∣don Stone  in  CannonStreet  over a Bottle of sound Red Port and while smoaking a Pipe of the newfound Plant Tobacco which had been introduced into  England  by Sir WALTER RALEIGH but about twentyfive Years before they discoursed at large of the Advantages that might be reaped from a Society of judicious Persons meet∣ing once a Week to debate on Subjects of Importance For an Account of the In∣stitution and Nature of the Society I am indebted to a Folio Book which I have now in my Custody in my Grandfather's own Handwriting and from which I have transcribed the following Passages  IT was here says the good old Man that wee fully discoursed of the Affaire Sir HUGH declared the Number of Per∣sons that were to compose our Societie ought to be limitted and that they shoulde not exceede twentie and in fine wee both agreed in this Point that wee woulde forthwith looke out and search for proper Persons to be∣longe to the Societie and whose Names wee woulde enter into a little Booke And after that we had gained our pro∣posed  Number of Persons which wee alsoe agreed shoulde be noe more than twentie nor less than twelve wee would assembel oureselves once in a Week at a House of one of the So∣cietie and the next Week at the House of another and so on 'till wee had been at each other's House After wee had spoken of these Things and fully agreed thereon as I have here amply related wee parted Sir HUGH going to a Countrie House he had late∣lie rented at  Mileend  and I going to mine in  NorfolkStreet  ABOUT one Moneth after this wee had gotten the Number of fifteen Per∣sons all of whome were Men of good∣lie Parts and discreete and worthie Conduct and at the Intreatie of my verie good Friende Sir HUGH wee met all of us at the  LondonStone  of a  Wed∣nesday  Night to write downe our Names in a Booke and to abide by and agree to a few Articles which were drawne up by Sir HUGH which conteined all the Rules that wee would be subject to and which I think meet here to set down  LET not the Reader think me too cir∣cumstantial for giving him the Articles which this Society of Disputants drew up and signed Any Thing relative to the Institution of a Society which has since that Time made such Noise in the World cannot be uninteresting on the contrary it may afford greater Pleasure to a curious Person than the Perusal of the trifling Anecdotes that the most eminent HistoryWriters often swell their Works with or even than many Papers that are obtruded on the World by a certain Society who yet deem themselves great Philosophers  ARTICLES and RULES Which WEE The undernamed PERSONS Do hereby agree to abide bye and to performe  First THAT we do agree to com∣pose and forme a Socie∣tie which shall be styled and called  THE SOCIETIE FOR FREE AND CANDID ENQUIRIE  Second That wee will assemble and meet at each other's Houses or Places of Abode Weeklie that is to saye at the House of Sir HUGH MYD∣DLETON the first Weeke at the House of THOMAS VENNE Esquier the second Weeke and at the succeed∣ing thirteene Gentlemens Houses whose Names are hereunder set in the Order they there appeare the thir∣teene next Weekes  Third That the Daie of our Meet∣inge shall be a Mondaie and to meete at Seven of the Clock in the Even∣inge and to breake up at Tenne of the Clocke  Fourth That to answer the Ende of our Intentions wee do agree each and all of us to write downe such use∣ful Questions as maye from Time to Time occur to us which shall be  copyed into a Booke and shall bee de∣bated on in the Order wherein they are set downe  Fifth That the first Thinge to bee done every Mondaie Night shall be to read the Question which is to bee dis∣coursed off that Eveninge and then everie one that desireth to speake to it maie do it but he shall not bee al∣lowed to speake more than ten Mi∣nutes nor shall he speake again 'till it cometh to his Turn  Sixth That wee do agree that noe Question that is professedlie on or savoureth of Religion or Affaires of State bee proposed or discoursed off for wee all are of Opinion that the first is of divine Origin and pure and undefyled as set forth in our ex∣cellent Liturgie and the taking on us such unwarrantable Libertie as to censure or to call in Question the Con∣duct of those whom the Kinge hath appointed to manage the Affaires of  his Kingdome is not a fit Matter for us to handel nor a proper Objecte for the Enquiryes of studious Men who wante onlie to cultivate and to mende their reasonable Faculties Besides it is flying in the Face of the Kinge himself whose sole Business it is to see his Kingdome hath proper and fit Ministers to manage the Affaires thereoff and in Effect censuring him that he doth not see public Affaires better conducted  Seventh That it shall and maye bee lawfull to and for any Member of this Societie to propose any Person to be∣longe to it but that the Name of such Person shall be delivered in Writinge to all the present under∣named and subscribinge Members but no more than five shall bee admit∣ted this present Yeare  In Witnesse of these our Articles Rules and Agreements we have here∣unto set our Names in our own HandWritinge  this fiveteenth Daie of the Moneth of October and in the Yeare of our Lord  HUGH MYDDLETON  THOMAS VENNE  WILLIAM G********  JOSEPH LEWIS  SAMUEL READ  JOHN DOWDING  SAM COOKE  BEN JERVIS  RICHARD PALMER  WILL SOMERVILLE  WILL WHITAKER  JOHN WHITAKER  JOHN SLADE  RICHARD READ  JOHN GRANT  THE first Meeting which this Society of Gentlemen had was the  Monday  subse∣quent to the Drawing up and Signing the foregoing Articles being the th Day of  October  At Seven o'Clock in the Evening precisely they all met at Sir HUGH MYDDLETON'S Town House which was in the  Strand  and after con∣gratulating each other on their proposed Undertaking and drinking two Glasses of Wine each Sir HUGH got into a large Elbow Chair and officiated as President the rest being seated in common Chairs placed there for that Purpose  SIR HUGH then read the Question to them for their Night's Debate which was as follows  Whether the common Methods of edu∣cateing Youth in this Nation are not very defective both with respecte to Morals and a Knowledge of the  Eng∣lish  Tongue  THIS Question the Reader will per∣ceive was a very good one and worthy the Consideration of the most respectable Society I might be thought unpardonably  prolix were I to transcribe the long Ac∣count which my Grandfather has given of the Debate upon this Question and the many learned and ingenious Arguments produced by the several Members yet it would be equally unpardonable to omit the capital Arguments and pass over in Silence the Manner in which this first Question of  The Society for Free and Can∣did Enquiry  was handled  Sir HUGH after he had read the Ques∣tion asked if any of the Gentlemen pre∣sent chose to deliver his sentiments of it to the Company On which Mr WHI∣TAKER got up and in a learned Speech pointed out the many errors which he apprehended prevailed in the then defec∣tive System of Education He expatiated on the Folly of the major Part of Parents of the lower Class in sending their Sons to School to learn many Parts of Educa∣tion which it was almost impossible and highly improbable from their situation in life they could possibly ever have any Occasion for He then pointed out the erroneous Methods that Schoolmasters in general made Use of to introduce Youth to the Knowledge of the Languages di∣stinguished with great Propriety and Pre∣cision the various Qualifications that  ought to centre in that Person that took on him the arduous Business of fashioning the juvenile Mind and instilling the Prin∣ciples of Science and shewed how these various Qualifications ought to be exerted towards those committed to their Care if any Fruit was to be expected from the young Nursery He then considered the Business of Education so far as it related to the Morals of Youth And here he lamented that the most important should be the most neglected Branch of Educa∣tion that the inculcating the great Duties of Religion and Morality should be look'd on as of such small moment as to be to∣tally disregarded and in fine that the System of Education in general left the Minds of Youth unfurnished with real Knowledge and their Hearts uninfluenced by the great Principles of Christianity  MY Grandfather enforced this Speech of Mr WHITAKER by some additional Arguments and placing the others in a stronger and more striking Light But the best and most remarkable Speech is that which was made by Mr JERVIS who was as appears by my MS at that time possessed of a Place at Court which pro∣duced him upwards of thirteeen hundred  Pounds a Year an immense Sum at that time This Speech in my Opinion is so good and the Complaint he makes of the defective Methods of Education in those Days so well adapted to the  modern  Me∣thod of Education that I think I can∣not do better than give his Speech at full Length  THIS Question Mr President is certainly of the last Importance and worthy of the most serious Considera∣tion The forming of the Minds of Youth and implanting in them such Seeds as when ripened to Maturity may bring forth much good Fruit is in my Opinion of more Moment than any other Subject about which we may interest ourselves and therefore de∣serves to be fully spoken to  THE human Mind has been compa∣red by antient Writers to a Piece of Wax that may be moulded to any Form and is capable of receiving any Impression while it is young and pli∣able but when it grows old and stiff it is with the utmost Labour and at a vast Expence of Time that we can imprint the Shape of what we desire on it  From hence we may and must infer that it is the Duty of every Parent to train up his Child to such Learning as may in time qualify him to be a worthy Member of that Community to which he belongs And let it be considered too that Youth is the best Time for doing this for the Reason before as∣signed and also because such Princi∣ples both of Religion Morality and Learning which are inculcated or as it were engraved on his Heart will grow with his Growth and strengthen with his Strength and at length will be written on the Tablet of his Soul in such deep and legible Characters as Time itself shall not be able to erase Consider too Gentlemen it is far ea∣sier to learn good things than to unlearn bad ones which I apprehend there is some Necessity of doing according to the present System of Education pre∣vailing in this Kingdom and which I shall now endeavour to prove  IN the first Place then I think that the true End of Education is both grosly neglected and manifestly perverted by the Professors of it not duly consider∣ing the Difference of Genius in Boys  the different Conditions of Life in which they are placed and the different Pro∣fessions and Trades they are designed for Education is like a vast Bason of fine Water which belongs to a large Town and to which every Inhabitant has an equal Right but every one that would receive the Advantages of it must furnish ConduitPipes to direct it to his own House in like Manner as our worthy President first planned and has now compleated the Current of  Ware  Water to the House of every Inhabitant in  London  But if our Pro∣fessors of Education do not duly consi∣der the Capacities of those intrusted to their Care but furnish the Heads of intended Taylors Barbers and Shoe∣makers with such Branches of Learn∣ing as are not only ornamental but absolutely necessary in Divines Law∣yers Physicians or Gentlemen of Rank who want to make a Figure in the World then Education may be truly said like Water running to Waste though extremely good in it∣self to be of no real service to any one but rather a Misfortune to the educated Person since the Length of Time employed in gathering Chaff  might have been much better employed in reaping Corn by which I mean such Parts of Education as are necessary for such particular Person  When a Person like that I have been describing arrives to an Age when Reason begins to exert itself and to blaze forth with a considerable Degree of Lustre he finds he has miserably mispent his Time in learning Things which can possibly be of no Service to him and neglecting those which are necessary to his going through life with Credit to himself and Utility to So∣ciety in general Before he can furnish himself with Pieces of useful Know∣ledge it is necessary that he divest him∣self of some Prejudices which he must have contracted and some Things which he must have learnt while at School And it is not less difficult to do these Things than to gain new and useful Acquisitions in travelling the Road of Science and rambling in the Fields of Learning Since then Sub∣stances not Shadows Things not Sounds deserve the Attention of a wise Man it is highly necessary that Wisdom and real Learning should be taught in our public Schools and Semi∣naries  But it may be asked what are Wisdom and real Learning I answer a thorough Knowledge of the Princi∣ples of the Christian Religion and of the great Duties of Morality and a competent Knowledge of the  English  Tongue But neither of these I ap∣prehend are taught The dead Lan∣guages only engross the Attention and excite the Care of Tutors and School∣masters And indeed if a Knowledge of those Languages would facilitate the Attainment of Wisdom itself and mend the Morals of those that learn them it would be a useful and an ornamental Part of Education to every one not only to the Prince but Peasant not only to the Nobleman or Divine but to the Tradesman and Artificer But I will be bold to say these Things are not so nor do they produce these ef∣fects A Knowledge of the Languages is not Knowledge itself but a Key only that being in the Hands of People of Rank and Fortune or those of the learned Professions may by them be made an Instrument to unlock and open the Chests of Knowledge from whence they may load themselves with Trea∣sure but the same Things taken from  these Chests of Knowledge are not only of no Value to Men in mean Trades or to low Artisans but abso∣lutely an Incumbrance  NAY we may go still farther and assert that the learning of some particular Branches of Literature has manifestly a bad Tendency to encourage in the Minds of those Youths intended for Trade such Notions of Things as will absolutely disqualify them from excel∣ling in their Businesses for instead of endeavouring to become eminent in their Trades they will be ambitious of being thought great Scholars though after all perhaps the Rudiments and first Principles of Learning only they have Capacities for acquiring Hence a mistaken Notion of their Superiority over others in the same humble Stations of Life will arise and the Pride and Vanity they possess and which lead them to disdain their Fellows will in∣fallibly draw down on them  their  Con∣tempt and Indignation and the Laugh∣ter or Pity of the rest of Mankind By these Means Men that might have become useful Members turn Pests of Society or at least mere excrescences  and thus is the Community robbed of the Industry and Genius of many Indi∣viduals whose Talents if diverted into a proper Channel and exerted on pro∣per Objects might have brought Ho∣nour to their Country Improvement to their particular Trade and Profit to themselves and Family  THE Care and Attention of a School∣master ought to be immediately directed to these Points He should endeavour to discover the particular Genius which every Boy possesses for there is no Boy but has a Genius for some Art or Science more than another and it ought to be cherished and cultivated to the utmost Many a Man for Want of a due Attention to this Rule now cuts a despicable Figure as a Povertystruck Physician who might have proved an ingenious Painter and have acquired great Fame and Wealth And many a dull Clergyman now thumps a Cushion or reads a dull Composition to a drowsy Audience who might have proved an excellent Cutler and furnished the World with such Wares as might have engrossed the Trade in that Branch of Manufac∣ture  to  Britain  alone which is now shared by other Nations  BESIDES consider too Gentlemen that the Time we are at School is by far too long and too precious to be thrown idly away which it most cer∣tainly is if not properly employ'd No less than seven or eight Years is thought sufficient to lay in a proper Stock of Learning even for the lowest Rank of People and what that Learning is I have before told you For my Part I must pronounce it a most ridiculous Piece of Vanity in the lowest Order of People to have their Children taught  Latin Greek French  the Mathema∣tics or any other Branch of Literature which is not immediately necessary and requisite to them in the Trades they are designed for And I would gladly know whether to weigh a Pound of Rasins or Sugar to make a fullbot∣tomed Peruque to cut out a Suit of Cloaths or to sell a Pair of Shoes a Man that is illiterate is not as well qua∣lified as he that understands  Algebra  or  Greek  I AM not Gentlemen speaking against the Utility of such Branches of Learning but I am for confining them to their proper Learners nor am I to be understood as an Enemy to Tradesmen and Artisans partaking of the common Advantages that flow from Literature but I am for limitting them to such Branches of it as may be for their own Good What these Branches are is very evident a Know∣ledge of their own Tongue so as to be capable of reading and speaking it with Propriety a Knowledge of the Principles of their Religion and a Knowledge also of Writing and Arith∣metic And these in my Opinion are sufficient for People intended for mean Trades  I SHALL now Gentlemen shew you another Defect in the Conduct of our Schools and that is an improper Choice of Books Sure I am that a great Number of Books now univer∣sally made Use of are a Disgrace to Humanity and a Scandal to a Christian Nation It has ever been an Opinion of mine that without a Perusal of  HORACE JUVENAL CATULLUS MARTIAL in our tender Years we might attain a thorough Knowledge of the  Latin  Language and we might understand  Greek  without learning ARISTOPHANES All these Authors were great Libertines and speak of a de∣testable Vice that reflects Dishonour on Human Nature in such Terms as shew their Approbation and Practice of it and I must declare it as my Opinion that had such Authors not have men∣tioned it in the Manner they do the Vice itself would have been unknown to and unpractised by succeeding Ages Were there no other Cause but this those Authors ought never to enter a School and surely the Impossibility of learning  Latin  or  Greek  without them can never be pleaded when we have  Christian  Writers that have written on the most important Subjects in a pure and classical Style in such great Num∣bers  THE Knowledge of the  English  Tongue is of the last Importance to every one but this great Branch is al∣most entirely neglected We do not learn to  speak  it at all and how we are  taught to  read  it I leave to every one's own Experience In  Latin  and  Greek  which perhaps we have no Occasion to make Use of above once a Year no Pains no Expence is thought too great to make us Adepts but to make us speak  English  well which we have Occasion to do every Day of our Lives no Expence no Pains are bestowed on us  In these several Particulars I have mentioned I think the common Me∣thods of educating Youth in this Na∣tion are very defective and I think that Man who would point out a proper Remedy for these Diseases would de∣serve well of Society and be justly considered as a Friend to Mankind in general I shall mention one which I think would contribute not a little to cure the Disorders that must inevita∣bly ensue from the present defective System for he must be a bad Man who shews us our Unhappiness and does not in some Measure endeavour to re∣move it  THE remedy then which I imagine would be serviceable in the literary Dis∣ease  I am speaking of is to compel all those who set up public Schools for the Education of Youth to wait on four or five Clergymen of Integrity and Learn∣ing to be examined with Respect to their Abilities and to receive under their Hands duly attested proper Cer∣tificates of their being capable of under∣taking that great Work previous to their actually engaging in it Were this to be done the Number of School∣masters would be greatly reduced but it would excite a sufficient Number of able Men to engage in the Business of Teaching as the fewer there were of them the greater would be their Profit  I COULD point out more Methods Mr President to advance Education but I have been already too prolix and therefore shall trespass no more on your Time at present but propose a Ques∣tion on that Subject for our debating some future evening  How far these Complaints of one of the first Members of the Disputing Society made one hundred and fifty one Years ago were just appears by the unanimous Ap∣plause my Grandfather has observed was  given to his Speech And how far appli∣cable his Observations on the defective Sy∣stem of Education then in Vogue are to the present I leave to the Determination of every learned Reader  THE subsequent  Monday  being the th of  October  the Society met for the second Time This Meeting was held at the House of THOMAS VENNE  Esq  a Man of an immense Fortune and great Erudition at his House in St  James's Square  THE Question debated that Evening was  Whether notwithstanding the Complaints made both by the Clergye and Laitye of the Degeneracye of the Age the Moderns are not more virtuous and wise than the Ancients  IN discussing this Question many learn∣ed and ingenious Arguments were produ∣ced by the Members in Support both of the Affirmative and Negative Sides of it But the major Part of the Society were for the Affirmative and evidently demon∣strated the Superiority of the then present  Age to any former both with Respect to their Knowledge of the Arts and Sciences and their leading more exemplary Lives They proved these two Opinions by the infallible Evidence of Scripture drawing a Comparison between the Principles and Manners of the People of old with the present wherein the latter appeared infi∣nitely more wise and not near so wicked as the Holy Writings inform us the World antiently was They then enquired into the Cause of public Speakers and Writers representing the Degeneracy of the Age in such lively Colours and their being sunk deeper into the Pits of Iniquity and Ignorance than any former Ages and they supposed it to arise from the Want of a Relish for innocent Gratifications in those public Speakers and Writers from their having been disappointed in their Pur∣suits and Expectations which sowered their Minds and gave them a Disgust to the World and from Pride and Vani∣ty which swelling their Souls and in∣toxicating their Imaginations made them look down with Contempt from their own fancied Height of Excellence on those they imagined so far beneath them  THE next Time of their Meeting was on  Monday  the d of  November  at my Grandfather's House near  CharingCross  but I should be too prolix were I to relate the Particulars of this Meeting and the several Arguments which this ingenious Set of Gentlemen made Use of in the debating of their Question I shall how∣ever inform my Reader what that Question was and mention a few others which were debated in their Turn at the Houses of the other Members  Whether from the various Accounts gi∣ven to us in Historie we may not reasonablie conclude that  Demost∣henes  was a greater Orator than  Cicero  Whether the Manufacture of Broad Cloth might not be carried to a still greater Degree of Perfection  THIS Question was agreed by the So∣ciety to be debated on again the next  Mon∣day  Night which was the th of  Novem∣ber  and the Subject being in their Opinion of the greatest Importance and not ex∣hausted after they had again discussed it  that Evening it was agreed that it should be a Subject for their Entertainment a third Night  Whether Emulation in brave and noble Minds and Envy in cowardly and base ones are not Acquirements in the Possessors own Power  ON this Question I must remark that however intelligible it might be at that Time of the Day it is not so now nor do I see what Purpose the proposing it could serveno Debates appear by my Manuscript to have been made upon it  Whether the Improvement of our Heads and the Improvement of our Hearts do not go Hand in Hand  What Kind of Education is the most proper for a Nobleman a Gentleman and a Tradesman  What Regulations or Improvements are needful to be made in Order to ad∣vance the great Work of Education in this Kingdom  Whether if a Committee or Number of Gentlemen of acknowledged Abilities were appointed either to draw up or to alter the Epitaphs which according to the present Method disgrace our ChurchYards it would not reflect Honour on the Nation and excite a higher Opinion of our Wisdom in the Minds of judicious Foreigners  Whether the Stage under proper Regu∣lations might not be made an Aid to Wisdom an Enforcer of Virtue and a Supplement to the Pulpit  Whether a Spendthrift or a Miser is the most useless Member of the Com∣munity  ON this Question my Grandfather made a Remark which I cannot forbear transcribing  A Spendthrift says he is like a Grashopper and a Miser like a Jack∣daw The former dissipates his Sub∣stance and sings away his Time in his Summer of Life regardless of what may happen to him in Winter and  not considering that wilful Waste brings woeful Want and the latter hides the Treasure he has collected and which he can never enjoy They both are Fools and unfit for Society but the Miser I think is most so The Miser is a mere Muckworm a Dunghill∣maker that has brought together a Quantity of Manure which if pro∣perly distributed would enrich the na∣tional Soil the Spendthrift however an Enemy to himself is the generous Hand that scatters the rich Dung that doth Good to Thousands  Whether the Difference of Genius obser∣vable in the People of different Na∣tions is owing to the Climate Soil Form of Government or Education  Whether an hypocritical Sinner or an open and audacious one be the greatest Enemy to Society  SUCH were the first thirteen Questions debated by the then infant Society at their Meetings at the Members Houses the last of which was held at the House of my Grandfather  I SHALL now take a Liberty frequently used by Biographers and other Writers that of skipping over a long Space of Time in which nothing material happened in the Society save that it increased in Numbers and in Fame  FOR no less than eightandtwenty Years was it continued on the same Principles and conducted in the same Manner as at its first Establishment during all which Time my Grandfather belonged to it who has not only preserved in a large Folio Book all the Questions proposed but also the Debates on those that were more particu∣larly interesting or which more forcibly excited his Curiosity  FROM whatever Cause it was owing I know not but for half a Year the Society was adjourned which was the Summer of I have been sometimes tempted to impute it to the particular Severity of the Usurper's Government and the criti∣cal Exigency of the Times but that could not be the Case as the Meetings were again held in  October  being at the Time of the dreadful  Irish  Massacre when no less than Souls were cruelly mur∣dered  though some Writers for some sinister Views or Reasons best known to themselves have diminished the Numbers that fell by the Hands of the Murderers more than twothirds  SHORTLY after their assembling toge∣ther again a great Number of Gentlemen of Rank and Fortune having heard of their Fame and approving their Scheme offered themselves as Members But the Society imagining that it would be ex∣tremely inconvenient for a greater Number of Members to meet together refused ad∣mitting them and declared they would not alter or break in on their original Plan  IN this Manner they continued 'till the Restoration of King CHARLES II in and to shew in what Esteem they were held I shall transcribe the following curious Anecdote which the Reader may depend on as a Matter of Fact  OUR Society now began to attract the public Attention in a very particu∣lar Manner and was so much discour∣sed of and so universally applaused that it even excited Majesty itself to pay  us a Visit He was introduced to us by Sir HUGH who inform'd us he was a distant Relation of his that coming lately from the Country and hearing of our Fame as he expressed it was desirous of hearing himself those Debates which the World talk'd so loudly of Now several of us would have known the King had he appear'd in  propriâ Personâ  but he had put a Piece of black Silk over his left Cheek which almost cover'd it and his Eye∣brows which were quite black he had by some Artifice or other converted to a light brown or rather to a flaxen Colour and had disguised himself in his Apparel and Looks so effectually that none of us knew him and of this Circumstance my good Friend Sir HUGH was entirely silent 'till two Years afterwards being no Doubt so caution'd by his Majesty  THIS little Anecdote throws a farther Light on the Character of that facetious Monarch who as we may gather from History lov'd a Frolic at his Heart and was never happier than when at some pub∣lic Entertainments or Assemblies of his Subjects where he might throw off the  cumbrous Robes of Majesty and give a free and natural Vent to his humorous Dis∣position I find that he was so well en∣tertain'd with the Debates of the Society that he came there three Times more and expressed himself greatly satisfied with an Institution which he declared had so great a Tendency to enlarge the Mind and to refine the Taste  THE Society had now existed fortyseven Years and of the Members that first form'd it two only surviv'd my Grand∣father and Sir HUGH But it being like the immortal Regiment of FREDERICK II King of  Prussia  supplied with new Mem∣bers as the old ones dropp'd off there was no Doubt of its Dissolution especially as they took Care to elect such Men only as were possessed of Integrity and Abilities for it was an invariable Maxim with them that none but such should be admitted let their Station in Life Age Connections or Fortune be what they would  FIVE Years after this Time the dread∣ful Plague happen'd which carried off no less than sixtyeight Thousand five Hundred and eightysix Souls Men Women and Children Among them was my Grand∣father  who after being seized with it and continuing excessively ill for eleven Days departed this Life in the eightyse∣venth Year of his Age having for the last fiftytwo Years been a Member of the Society for free Enquiry of which he was the first Proposer and Promoter and with the Assistance of Sir HUGH MYDDLE∣TON the chief Establisher  End of the FIRST PART  THE HISTORY OF THE  Robinhood Society  PART II  H  ITHERTO we have been enabled to compile this Histo∣ry by the Manuscript of my Grandfather He has been as it were our Polar Star by whose Light we have directed our Course and if that Light shall be adjudged suffi∣cient to reflect a Splendor on so obscure a Subject as that which we have attemp∣ted  a Subject whose Original Rise and Progress cannot I believe be traced with greater Fidelity involved as it is in the Darkness of Time and to satisfy the Expectations of the Reader we shall think ourselves very happy It is true that we could have been more minute in the Description of several Things could have transcribed many Speeches of various Members on different Subjects which we have entirely omitted and have given  all  the Questions that were debated by the Society from their first Establishment in to the Time of my Grandfather's Death in But the doing these Things we have conceived unnecessary since it must have been very dry and in∣sipid to our Readers a very disagreeable Task for ourselves and would have swel∣led this History to an enormous Size  WE shall now in this Second Part continue our History from my Grand∣father's Death till the Removal of the Society to the  EssexHead  in  EssexStreet  when its original Plan was alter'd and its Conduct became very different and shew its various Fortune till its last Trans∣migration to the  Robinhood  in  ButcherRow  where it now continues to be held  MY Father for some Years before my Grandfather's Death had been admitted a Member of the Society and was looked on as a very intelligent and worthy Man He was not less fond of it than my Grand∣father and no less particular in transcri∣bing from the ClubBook the various Que∣stions that were inserted there and the several Arguments that passed  pro  and  con  on the Subjects when they came to be debated This he performed in the same large Folio Book my Grandfather made Use of for the same Purpose and which being now in my Possession enables me to compile this Work  IN the Year the Society had some Thoughts of enlarging their Plan and admitting more Members They had re∣ceived Applications from several Men of Quality and great Numbers of others di∣stinguished for Wit and Judgment for their being admitted to partake of the In∣struction and Entertainment which their Debates afforded but so general an Ad∣mission was deemed impracticable on Ac∣count of the great Inconvenience the Members would all be put to in their Turn to entertain so many Persons and  therefore such Applications were to no Purpose  OCCASIONAL Visitants had been how∣ever allowed the Liberty of being present at the Debates and to speak themselves to the Question if they thought proper Re∣straint irritates Desire and Things forbid∣den have greater Charms for Mankind than those they are at free Liberty to en∣joy So proved it with those Gentlemen who though they had been present at the Debates of the Society were not Mem∣bers of it Enraged to find they had not the Liberty of becoming Members they deviated from the Questions they should have spoken to and complained that a Society that was not free for the Reception of every one in general that had an Incli∣nation to frequent it could have no good Effect and that supposing its Influence on the Manners and Principles of those that attended it ever so great the Public in general could reap no Advantage from it  IN this Manner the Society went on for some Time and the Debates were a mot∣ly Mixture of angry Censures and solid Arguments Animadversions on the Que∣stions proposed and Complaints of the  narrow Spirit of the Society So that the original Intention of the first Members was entirely frustrated and the Satisfaction and Pleasure which must always arise from a reciprocal Communication of Sentiments between learned and ingenious Men gave Way to private Cabals and personal Invec∣tives which will ever check the Growth of Knowledge and choak up the Paths of Truth  TO put a Stop to these Proceedings one of the Members a Man of a violent Spirit and boisterous Disposition proposed it to the Consideration of the Society whether it would not be adviseable to refuse Admit∣tance for the future to any Gentleman whatever that might desire to be an occa∣sional Visitant and to make such an Order in their Book And he gave it as his Opi∣nion that without doing it the Society must soon fall to the Ground by the Up∣roar and tumultuous Proceedings which frequently prevailed there  HE was seconded in his Motion by ano∣ther of the Members a Man of like Tem∣per with himself who also gave it as his Opinion that no Person whatever let his Fortune or Rank in Life be what it would  ought to be admitted as an occasional Visi∣tant He observed that their Society was of a private Nature and that for People to insist on pushing into their Company and hearing their Sentiments of Men and Things whether they would or not was an unparallelled Piece of Assurance and equally unmannerly with a Beggar that cloathed in Rags and Wretchedness yet full of a true  Hibernian  Impudence would force his Way into a Gentleman's Parlour against his Consent He expatiated largely on the Folly of first permitting any Gentle∣man to attend there who was not a Mem∣ber and observed that though it was a Custom to grant such Permission yet the Breach of foolish Customs is better than the Observance of them And concluded by remarking that if they had in that Re∣spect travelled on in a wrong Road for fif∣teen Years last past there was no Reason they should still travel in it especially as they had then experienced the Inconveni∣encies that arose from it  THE many Debates and Arguments they had at various Times on this Topic at last produced the following Question  Whether it is proper to allow any Gentle∣man who is not a regularly chosen Member of this Society a Liberty of attending it  THIS Question gave Rise to many Ar∣guments on both Sides and produced no small Commotion The two hotheaded Members I have just mentioned were of Opinion that no Man however dignified or distinguished ought to have Liberty of coming there and urged all the Argu∣ments they were Masters of to support their Opinions which they did not do with the calm Demeanour of a venerable and pacific NESTOR whose Words fall from him like Flakes of Snow that melted as they fell but with all the Fire and Fury of an enraged AJAX  AS the Issue of this Debate produced a Revolution in the Society not less remark∣able in Proportion to the Numbers that were affected by it than the Revolution in the State that happened but two Years afterwards I shall transcribe the Speech that my Father made on the Occasion and which he declares made such an Impres∣sion on them that they followed his Ad∣vice  in the Alteration and Enlargement of their Plan  I LOOK on this Question Gentlemen to be of no small Importance as not only the Wellbeing but the very Ex∣istence of our Society must depend on the Determination we make concerning it and the Influence such Determina∣tion must necessarily have on our Con∣duct It has been allowed ye all know for Gentlemen recommended by any Member of our Society to be present at our Debates How long it has been allowed I cannot say but it has been so ever since I have had the Honour of belonging to it The Ad∣vantage our Society derives from this Permission is not inconsiderable It re∣ceives a Lustre and Character from the Reports which our occasional Visitants make of it to their Friends and thus Men of real Genius and Learning are induced to visit us and by their hear∣ing our Debates and listening to our Sentiments on Subjects of Importance or Matters of Controversy they are excited to give us theirs and thus we are mutually improved and mutually obligated Besides consider that very  frequently not one Half of the Members attend and if occasional Visitants were not then to come among us the De∣bates would grow languid and no Ar∣gument could subsist Those Gentle∣men that are for having no Persons to partake of the Entertainment they may expect and seek for here but Mem∣bers seem to resemble an avaritious covetous old Miser that hoards up his Bags and would have no one the bet∣ter for them Let us not be misers in Knowledge but despise the Character as much as we do him that closets up his Gold The worst Avarice is that of Wisdom and if we really possess any let us act like the generous Man and the good Christian that will commu∣nicate to others the good Things that he hath and give unto him that want∣eth If we have not that Wisdom which we may imagine and without Vanity imagine People think we have and which they come here to partake of they will perhaps give us some Ye all know Gentlemen that in the Di∣stribution of Things of this Kind he that gives away the most is never the poorer for it his Treasures are not the more exhausted Then let us not  be afraid that ours will be so but rather hope that we shall be enriched by the Treasures of those that often visit us and frequently come to us very oppor∣tunely in the Absence of some of our Members  ONE Gentleman has observed that foolish Customs ought to be broke through and that if we have travelled in a wrong Road for some Time it is proper to quit it and travel in a right Road I allow it Gentlemen but he ought to have  proved  these two Things He ought to have shewn that our Ad∣mission of Visiters was a foolish Cus∣tom and that the Road we had hitherto travelled in was a wrong one but he has not done these Things he has on∣ly given us his mere  Ipse Dixit  HE has observed likewise that for People to push themselves into our So∣ciety to hear our Debates is as un∣mannerly as for a Beggar to push with∣out Permission into a Gentleman's Parlour This I deny Gentlemen that come here do it by the Liberty that is given to each Member to bring one Friend with him and therefore  that is not a Case  in Point  As to the Inconveniencies that have arisen and the Tumults that have been raised they have not been owing to our admitting Visiters as that Gentleman has asserted but to our not admitting more And really I am of Opinion that a Society for free and candid Inquiry ought to be a free rnd candid Society But how can it be a free one if Gentlemen are denied Entrance How can it be a candid one if we obstruct the Propaga∣tion of KnowledgeIn short Gentle∣men I think our Plan might be im∣proved and a very necessary Reforma∣tion take Place a Reformation that will put a Stop to all Manner of Distur∣bances and increase our Reputation by the Accession of more Members  YOU experience very clearly Gentle∣men that the chief Inconveniencies we are put to is the Want of Room Could we but get a larger Place ca∣pable of holding conveniently a lar∣ger Company we should neither be so crowded nor would the Debates meet with such Obstructions Besides to speak my Sentiments plainly I don't  think that meeting at each other's Houses is at all proper We put our∣selves to many Inconveniencies we might avoid we suffer many Per∣plexities we have no Occasion to suffer and we disorder our Family Affairs when we might avoid doing it  I AM confident Gentlemen there is not a Man among ye how attached soever he is to the Interest of the Socie∣ty but dreads the Approach of that  Monday  when perhaps no less than fifty People are to assemble and some of us perfectly tremble at it For my Part I must contess that on the  Mon∣day  Evening the Society meets at my House I am the unhappiest Creature imaginable my Wife dislikes it and my Servants detest it I doubt not but this is the Case with ye all Gentlemen though your Respect for the Society and for one another has prevented your making Mention of it The Method of Meeting at each other's Houses might be extremely proper for the So∣ciety in its Infancy but I don't appre∣hend it is so now The same Reasons do not now exist as might then and  therefore we are not under the same Obligation to follow the same Method of Procedure in this Respect  WHEN this Society was first institu∣ted which was fiftythree Years ago there were only fifteen Members that composed it and no more were added to it for some considerable Time No Member then brought a Friend with him so that the Society might then be with great Propriety stiled a private one But that is not the Case now Our Number of established Members doubles theirs and the Number of oc∣casional Visitants that come among us allowing for the Absence of some Mem∣bers every  Monday  Night at least trebles it The Inconveniency that such a Num∣ber of People occasion to a Family I have before set forth and therefore shall now deliver it as my Opinion that this is a Grievance that wants a speedy Re∣dress and demands our Attention much more than whether it is proper to al∣low Gentlemen not Members of our Society a Liberty of attending it  This Speech was received with universal Applause Even the Gentlemen that op∣posed  my Father in the former Part of his Speech could not but join with him in the latter and they all came to a Resolution that their meeting at one another's Houses to debate threw their Families into great Confusion was improper in itself and re∣quired an Alteration  IN Consequence of this Opinion the Society came to a Determination of having their Meetings at some Tavern or Coffee∣house where they might be accommoda∣ted with a Room sufficient to hold a large Number of Gentlemen and where every one whose Curiosity excited him to attend the Debates might have a Liberty of en∣tering  IT may easily be imagined that in a City like  London  it could not be a very long Time before a House possessed of such a Room was discovered Indeed many such occurred to the Minds of the Mem∣bers but that which seemed most com∣modious and best adapted to their Pur∣pose was the  EssexHead  in  EssexStreet  TO this House therefore several of the Members went and having examined it very attentively reported to their Bre∣thren  on their Return that it would with some Alterations answer their Pur∣pose extremely well that they had spoken to the Landlord concerning it and that he had promised to do every Thing in his Power to make it agreeable to them  THE Society received this Account with general Approbation and informing the Landlord of the Nature of their Club he fitted up the largest Room in his House fixing Benches therein so as to make it contain upwards of an hundred Persons  THE Rules and Orders the Society had before observed were now altered  Be∣fore  every Member had in his Turn defray'd the whole Expence attendant on the Meeting held at his House but  now  they ordered that every Member and every Person that came to the Society to hear their Debates should previous to his Admission into the ClubRoom take a Ticket at the Bar for which he should pay Sixpence That every Sixpence so paid would be received by the Landlord in Consideration of which he should furnish them with as much  Porter  and  Lemonade  as would amount to the Sum total recei∣ved That the Price of both those Kinds  of Liquors should be rated at Fourpence a Pot That if any Gentleman chose other Liquors he should pay for them separately And that if any Money remained in the Landlord's Hands after he had deducted from the whole Money received the Price of the Porter and Lemonade he had fur∣nished the Society with it should be paid to his Servants in proportionable Shares in Consideration of the Trouble they were put to  THEY likewise formed some new Rules with Respect to the Conduct of the Society and their Methods of Debate of which the following are the most remarkable  Ordered  THAT the Society for free and candid Inquiry be a free one and open to any Person that thinks pro∣per to attend it  Ordered  THAT that no Person be admitted a Member of the Society un∣less he is elected by a Majority of Voices and that no Meeting be held for the Election of new Members but once a Quarter which shall be in a private Room after the Debates of the Night are over  Ordered  THAT Religion and Poli∣tics shall be debated on in this Society provided Decency and good Order be observed both in the wording the Que∣stion on those Subjects and in the Dis∣cussion thereof  Ordered  THAT more than one Question be debated of a Night if there is Time sufficient for so doing  Ordered  THAT no one shall be al∣lowed more than five Minutes to speak to the Question  Ordered  THAT no Question shall be proposed to the Consideration of the Society nor admitted in the Book as a Question unless it is signed by some Name  Ordered  THAT no Person shall be obliged to sign his own Name to any Question he shall think proper to pro∣pose but a fictitious one if he thinks proper  Ordered  THAT in the debating any Question the Proposer shall not be  obliged to father it or to open it by explaining the Terms and the Manner he would have it considered in unless he thinks proper But if no Person owns the Question it shall go from the President and be deemed as his after which it shall be debated in due Order the Person that sits on the Left Hand of the President to speak to it first  and so on  THESE are the most material new Re∣gulations which the Society made on their removing to the  EssexHead  their other Rules and Orders being the same as before  IT is impossible to conceive what Num∣bers of People attended the Society as soon as it was declared a free one and Liberty was given to every Person to enter it on pay∣ing Sixpence No one Topic for Con∣versation so universally prevailed as this It became a general Subject of Debate with∣out Doors as much as Philosophy Meta∣physics and the  Belles Lettres  did within From the Courtier down to the Peasant from the hoary Sage down to the playful Schoolboy Curiosity had extended her Influence and excited Desires in every  one to visit an Assembly of Men that had rendered themselves so famous  IN Consequence of such an universal and eager Curiosity Multitudes of People as∣sembled at the  EssexHead  every  Monday  Night some as Orators and some as Au∣ditors some to be instructed some to be entertained some to see and some to be seen some to shew their fine Cloaths and delicate Persons and some to criti∣cise the Speeches of the  EssexHead  Ora∣tors and entertain their Mistresses with an Account of the Debates and display their own Sagacity in distinguishing their Merits and their Defects  IT is not more wonderful for Critics to congregate at such Places than for Rooks and Jackdaws to meet in the Fields of human Slaughter A Critic that has not the Power of speaking a single Sentence in Public is yet able to dissect the finest Ora∣tions of the finest Orators he can dimi∣nish the Graces of Elocution and Action and exaggerate little Defects with all the petulance of Pedantry and Rage of Cen∣sure  SUCH Critics are like Eunuchs They have not Vigour nor Courage to act man∣fully themselves and they envy and cen∣sure those that do When they come into a public Assembly it is not to partake of its Entertainments but to seek Occasions of finding Fault and giving an illnatured Turn to the most harmless Amusements They are like so many Hounds at a Car∣case devouring their Prey as fast as they can and growling all the Time they are eating  THERE was likewise a Number of these Gentlemen of a higher Class the Writing Critics who attended the Society in Search of fresh Topics to exercise their Abilities and amuse the Public They knew that the Passion for Novelties must be gratified and when almost every Sub∣ject had been exhausted and every Field been so much traversed as to render the Whole a common beaten and highway Path it was necessary for those Sportsmen to turn out of the common Road where nothing but common Objects and Things that have been a thousand Times descri∣bed meet the Eye and strike into bye Lanes and covert Places where perhaps  Plenty of original and curious Game might he started hunted down with Sport and Plea∣sure and be at length cooked and served up as a choice Dish for the public Taste  THIS was the Case of the  Essex Head  Society While it was confined within the Bounds of each Member's House the Public in general knew but little of it and the venal Authors of those Days not having Intimacy and Interest enough with any of the Members to gain Admittance were of Course disabled from informing the World of the Nature of the Society and signalizing themselves by striking into a new Species of Writing and entertain∣ing the Public with a new Subject Not but of late Years the Race of WritingCritics is greatly improved Formerly those Votaries of Dullness never attempted to write on Subjects of which they had no Knowledge but now grown more vivacious and cultivating the finer Powers of Imagination they can traduce Men whom they never knew refute Arguments they do not understand and pronounce Sentence on Books they have not read  Nay the WritingCritics of the present Age are so sagacious that even the raw  and undisciplined can form a right Judg∣ment of every new Production by read∣ing only the first ten Lines and as to  Veterans  the Cooks of Monthly Hashes for the public Palate they can discover an Author by his  Style  and of Course know in ten Minutes whether they are to praise or censure his Piece Though indeed to their Credit it must be observ'd that they are not absolute Slaves to malig∣nant Obduracy for after they have vowed to damn a Work and its Author to Contempt and Obscurity a BeefSteak and a Bottle of Wine have had a wonder∣ful Efficacy in softening the Severity of their Dispositions making them adore and cherish that very Work which without the Interposition and Agency of the Wine and the Beef they would have butchered without Decency and devoured without Remorse  SO much for Critics of every SpeciesI shall now return to my History and as I am too poor to give a BeefSteak and a Bottle to secure it from the Reviewer's Place of Torment it must of Course be but no Matter  AS the Society was now declared to be free and Religion and Politics those in∣exhaustible Topics of Conversation were allowed to be handled the Room was crowded every Night and Orators like Mushrooms in a foggy Morning started up from every Seat The Exclusion of these Subjects from their Debates before had in the general Opinion of the Society robbed them of much Entertainment and Knowledge They therefore departed from the Maxims of the original Members who had declared that the Christian Reli∣gion being of Divine Original could not but be pure and holy and therefore not a fit Object for the Debates of Disputing Clubs and that for Philosophers and stu∣dious Men who wanted only to cultivate their rational Faculties by the Discussion of useful Subjects to wade into the Depths of Politics and to take on them the Li∣berty of scrutinizing into the Measures of State would be an unwarrantable Action and productive of no Good  NAY as it is usual not only with private Men but with public Assemblies to run into Extremes so our Society now deba∣ted  very few Questions but what were religious or political  TRUE Religion they observed like Silver seven Times purified in the Fire appear'd the brighter the more it was exa∣mined into and it was the indispensible Duty of every Man to search the Scrip∣tures and to endeavour to give an Answer to him that asketh a Reason for the Hope that is in him Nay without doing it every Man must be extremely criminal since if the only Reason a Man can give for his being of any particular Persuasion with Respect to his Religious Principles is that his Father and Mother were of the same Religion  he was  and that he professed that Religion because he was educated in it then by a Parity of Rea∣son a  Hottentot  or a  Mahometan  a  Jew  or a  Pagan  has as strong Reasons for his Mode of Religious Worship and is as justifiable in the Continuance of it as the Christian As to the seeming Impropriety of debating on Religion in a Public House and examining into its Principles over a Pot of Beer they concluded it was not only warrantable but laudable and infi∣nitely better than doing it in private  Houses where they could not have an Opportunity to instruct their Minds and refresh their Bodies at the same Time For they insisted that in all Debates whatever more especially on Religion the Conversation grows languid and insipid in Proportion as the Speakers grow hungry and thirsty and therefore a Welch Rab∣bit and a Pot of Beer were as necessary Requisites for a professed Orator as Know∣ledge and Elocution or even a Subject to harangue on  AS to the Admission of Political Ques∣tions they observ'd that in this Land of Liberty where the Goddess herself reigns with so much Lustre and infuses her chearing Influence into every Breast it is absolutely necessary for every one who has the Good of his Country at Heart to scrutinize into and examine the Measures which are from Time to Time taken by our State Pilots in the Management of and steering the Political Vessel That it is a Duty incumbent on every Man in a free State in a Rank of Life and posses∣sed of Abilities beyond the Vulgar to fathom the Depths of Government and to point out and expose the hidden Rocks  and dangerous Shoals on which Statesmen often split That as we are all Links of one great Chain we are all interested in the Fate of each other and bound by the most solemn Ties of doing our utmost for the Support and Welfare of that Com∣munity to which we belong And that though to direct the Helm of State requires an able Head and an incorrupt Heart Practice and Experience Courage and Prudence yet it has been found that as a Pigmy mounted on the Shoulders of a Giant may be able to see farther than the Giant himself so People not conversant with State Affairs may strike out some Road that being pursued may lead to Glory and Happiness and make some Observations of which those that have the Direction of public Affairs may avail themselves  FOR these and some other Reasons  equally  cogent they determined that Re∣ligion and Politics should find a Place in their Debates and employ their Attention as much as any other Subjects  THE first Question they had of a reli∣gious Nature was the following which the Reader will perceive was as ingenious  as it was modest highly emblematical of that Freedom of Enquiry which afterwards prevailed in that free Society  Whether Faith and Belief are not one and the same Thing And if so Whether it is in the least meritorious to believe what we cannot help upon the Conviction of the Senses  ANTIFIDELIS  MANY Arguments were urged on both Sides and Religion and Reason were ban∣died to and fro by the various Disputants as a Football is by a Company of Soldiers or a Shuttlecock by the alternate Strokes of sounding Battledores  THE Affirmatives strongly insisted that Faith was nothing but a Conviction in the Mind of the Truth of any particular Doctrine or Thing that we could not help from the internal Evidence we have of Things to believe or disbelieve them that in Consequence of our examining them we form our Opinion or in other Words our Faith and that since the Evidence produced within every Man's Mind is more or less forcible in Propor∣tion as it strikes the Imagination it is no  Wonder that the Opinion or Faith of Mankind should be so greatly different and that one should firmly believe what another so strenuously denies They al∣ledged that if a Man did all in his Power to arrive at a due Knowledge of Things and in Consequence of his gaining the best Information he could grounded his Belief he was not culpable let that Belief be what it would but any one that sits down contented with Things as he finds them and believes them without a free and im∣partial Examination of their Nature and Tendency is extremely culpable since he only believes what he has been taught as a Parrot may prate what he has been in∣structed in That to examine into the Truth of any Doctrine before we assent to it is our Duty that implicit Faith is a Monster in its Nature and worthy only of Papal Regions where the Mind is fet∣tered and Credulity and Ignorance stalls at large  MANY other Arguments were produced in Support of the Opinions of those inge∣nious Gentlemen which it would be too tedious to enumerate the Result how∣ever of their Enquiries and the Inferen∣ces they drew from their Propositions  were that Faith of whatever Kind or Nature soever was not in the least meri∣torious and of consequence not necessary to Salvation since it depended only on the Formation of our Minds and their Capability of distinguishing with Precision and Accuracy the Nature of Things which accordingly influenced us to reject or admit to believe or disbelieve any Pro∣position or Doctrine which came under the Examination of our Senses and that an Infidel and a Christian are alike accepta∣ble to God and useful Members of the Community  I SHALL not give the Substance of what was said on the other Side of the Question for the greater Part of the Speakers were those who disbelieved the Truth of the Christian Religion and those who spoke in its Defence injured the Cause they should have supported and betrayed the Fort they should have defended by their feeble and ridiculous Arguments To re∣fute therefore the Observations before made would not be to record the Proceed∣ings of the Society but to give my own Opinion  ONE Observation I must however be permitted to make An ignorant Chris∣tian that pretends to defend Christianity against the Attacks of Infidels is the greatest Enemy it can have The Shafts of Ridicule pointed against it by its Foes are too blunted and the divine Shield of Truth which Christianity has to defend her is too strong for any Impression to be made on it It must not be concluded therefore that if in public Societies Christianity is not always defended with a cool and intrepid Spirit against the hot Assaults of a whole Legion of Adversaries that it is not defensible Let but the pre∣tended Friends of Christianity hold their Tongues and it will defend itself but if they open the Gate to its Foes it is no Wonder that they should enter and tri∣umph without a Victory  TO give the Reader as satisfactory Ac∣count of the Society as I can and to en∣able him to form an adequate Idea of the Members that composed it I shall trans∣cribe a few of the Questions they debated and give a brief History of a few of the principal Speakers  SOME of the Questions that adorn the Book of Debates and called forth the Oratorial Abilities of the Members are as follow  RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS  Whether the Ceremonies and Practice of Mankind relative to Marriage under the Mosaic Dispensation were super∣seded or set aside by the Christian Revelation  JUDAEUS  Whether the Character of the Man after  GOD  's own Heart is proper for the Imitation of People in these Days  TITUS  Whether a Plurality of Wives practised by the first Race of Men is not justi∣fiable by the present as the Doctrine and Practice were not abrogated by the first Christians  ANGLICANUS  Whether the Doctrine of the Trinity can be justified either by Reason or Scripture  ANTITRINITARIAN  Whether a positive Command to believe in Doctrines we have no Conception of and cannot compel our Reason to sub∣mit to has not a manifest Tendency to hoodwink our rational Faculties and to put us on a Level with Beasts whom we command to perform our Wills without giving them any Reasons for our so doing  PHILOLIBERTATIS  Whether the Doctrines of Christianity are not irreconcileable to the Reason and repugnant to the Interests of Mankind  DRACO  Whether the Exercise of our rational Fa∣culties independent of any supernatural Assistance be not sufficient to guide us to Salvation And if it is not a gross Affront to the Wisdom of the  Great First Cause  to suppose the contrary  BRITANNICUS  Whether it is consistent with the Common Sense of Mankind to believe that the Divine  LOGOS  or  Word  or  Su∣preme Being  could be born of a Vir∣gin  NEGATIVUS  Whether any one is accountable to any Body of Men whatever for his religi∣ous Sentiments  CHRISTIANUS  Whether the Variety of Religious Systems all pretending to have the Divine Au∣thority of the Sacred Writings for their Foundation does not warrant an un∣prejudiced and a rational Person to sus∣pect the Authenticity of those Writings Or if not to decline being a Member of any visible Church  CHUBB  As these Questions are sufficient to shew into what Extravagancies Men may be led by the  Freedom of Enquiry  some though not expunged from the Book of Debates are yet omitted here as too impious and blasphemous to be repeated  POLITICAL QUESTIONS  Whether the Power lodged in a Prime Minister be not too great to be en∣trusted with any Subject and if in  Time it will not sap the very Vitals of our Constitution  ARISTARCHUS  Whether if it can be undeniably proved that a K has broke his Coronation Oath the Subjects are not discharged from their Allegiance  DUBITOR  Whether a Monarch who loads an unde∣serving Favourite with Treasures and who hears and sees every thing with  HIS  Ears and Eyes merits the glorious Title of a Patriot King notwithstand∣ing the fulsome Adulation and servile Compliments paid him by dependent Sy∣cophants and venal Authors  REPUBLICANUS  Whether the great Snow we had some time past  The great Snow here alluded to happened in and continued without Intermission eleven Days Great Damages were occasioned thereby Huts and little Houses were intirely covered the Current of our Rivers was stopped and Multitudes of People miserably perished  attended with a smart Frost has not had a wonderful Effect in freez∣ing  and congealing the Senses of some certain Ministers  SARCASTICUS  Whether a King who in a Speech he makes from his Throne solemnly declares he will perform certain Actions which he never does perform asserts manifest Falsehoods that are evident to the whole Nation and endeavours to make his Subjects believe that black is white and that two and two make five is a bet∣ter Monarch than  Alfred  or  Constan∣tine  ANTONINUS  Whether the Smiles of a Monarch can purify the Heart of a Gamester or the Bed of a Countess sanctify Lewdness and Adultery notwithstanding both the  UTOPIAN  Monarch and Countess are bedawbed over by venal Pens and re∣presented as Pious Good Great and every Thing that is excellent  DUN SCOTUS  Whether the notorious Practice of the Mi∣nistry's interfering with the Election of Members of Parliament and the Arts of Bribery and Corruption so univer∣sally known to be made Use of on those  Occasions do not reflect Dishonour on the that permits or connives at those illegal Practices which manifestly tend to destroy the Freedom of the Sub∣ject  MARCUS AURELIUS  Whether triennial Parliaments would not be for the good of this Nation  AUGUSTUS  THESE are some of the Religious and Political Questions debated by the Soci∣ety and from their Nature and Tendency the Reader is enabled to judge of the rest He may observe that the most abstruse and the most easy Subjects are alike de∣bated on those that the greatest human Faculties cannot reach and those that the veriest Blockhead can understand  THE Absurdity of such Questions must appear to every one What can be more ridiculous than for a Society of Philoso∣phers and Christians to endeavour to explain Mysteries to fathom what is unfathom∣able and to conceive what is inconcei∣vable Such is the Pride of human Wit and such our Delight in reconciling Para∣doxes and fighting with Shadows that we neglect the Study of Subjects that are of  the last Importance and easy to be under∣stood and employ our Thoughts on those that are out of the Reach of finite Capa∣cities and which could they be explained and understood would cease to be myste∣rious for as an eminent Divine has just∣ly observed a Mystery explained is a Con∣tradiction in Terms since being explained it becomes no Mystery at all  NOR less absurd and ridiculous is the de∣bating on Subjects that can admit of no rational Debate or the least Doubt Why should an Assembly of Men whose pro∣fessed Intention is to improve one ano∣ther propose a Queston  Whether Vice is Vice or not  For that is the whole Pur∣port of the sixth Political Question before set down That Vice is intrinsically Vice in Subject or in King can admit of no Dispute No Power no Rank no For∣tune can alter the Essence of Things however they may gild them over and conceal their native Horror As to the other Questions both Religious and Poli∣tical I forbear commenting on them But I must needs observe that I think the first are extremely indecent and the latter vastly bold to be discussed in a public So∣ciety to say nothing of the Application  that every one cannot help making when attentively considering the last  I COME now to perform the Promise I before made of giving a concise Account of a few of the principal Speakers in this illustrious Society But as some of them are still living instead of their real Names I shall characterise them under fictitious ones  POMPONIUS ATTICUS was a young Gentleman of Genius and Judg∣ment of a graceful Presence and ready Elocution But Fancy frequently got the better of sober Reflection and hurried him into Inconsistencies and Paradoxes which all his Wit and Learning could not support He was according to the recei∣ved Meaning of the Word a Deist but according to a true Expression of that Cha∣racter an Unbeliever of the Truth of the Christian Religion and the Divinity of its Author He had an Estate left him by his deceased Father of seven hundred a Year which he had mortgaged to almost its full Value at different Times and dissipated the Produce in the Pursuit of fashionable Vices and Follies so that at the Age of twentyseven when he first became a  Member of the  EssexHead Society  an Annuity for Life of sixty Pounds only re∣mained A loose and disorderly Life gene∣rally brings on some Rebukes of Consci∣ence and some alarming Reflections To prevent their Influence returning Appe∣tite and strong Temptation present them∣selves and enlisting the Will under their Banners Reason is seduced and Consci∣ence smothered But as under the most mountainous Oppression these rigid Mo∣nitors will call sorth with a loud Voice and bid their Master beware of the gilded Poison that presents itself to his View and dash the unblessed Cup from his desiring Lips so POMPONIUS feeling the dread∣ful Consequences of Vice and attending to the Monitors within resolved to reform his Life and to forsake the Companions of his Wickedness But this Resolution was but transitory The first fine Woman he saw disarmed him and he fell from his Heroism A Continuance in Wickedness debilitates the Faculties and urges us to defend what we practise Instead there∣fore of leaving off the Practice of Vice POMPONIUS began to extenuate itto justify itand to admire it He now commenced a philosophic Rake defended his Actions by Figures of Speech and ha∣rangued  on the Expediency and Utility of Fornication with the choicest Metaphors He was now surprised at his former Pusil∣lanimity and Doubt and was clearly of Opinion that the Practice of Whoredom was justifiable by Reason that great Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Man and tended greatly to the Support of the Com∣monWealth The Transition of this State of Mind into a perfect Composure and Serenity in the Practice of Vice is very quick Before we have deviated from the Path of Duty indeed Consci∣ence that illnatured Snarler that Enemy to our Happiness suggests a thousand Rea∣sons for our Continuance in the same Road and pretends to assert that the pleasant Views and delightful Prospects we see on each Side of us are unreal and a mere Moc∣kery of the Senses and warns us with an an earnest and a loud Voice not to for∣sake the Road we are in to grasp at Sha∣dows or to catch Butterflies Nobly disdaining to be controuled by so rigid a Monitor we quit the Path in which we safely trod and turn towards the Bowers of Bliss and Beds of Roses where Sy∣rens solicit our Approach and urge us to recreate our jaded Senses and refresh our tired Limbs We comply with the kind  Invitation We are lulled to rest by the soft Melody of ensnaring Voices We en∣ter the Bowers of Bliss we throw our∣selves on the Beds of Roses fully persua∣ded we shall there be happyBut ah what Horror invades us when we find Harpies and Furies are the Inhabitants of those Bowers and that Adders and Vi∣pers and Scorpions lurk beneath the Rose Beds  So was it with POMPONIUS But of the latter Pa t of this Description he ex∣perienced not the Truth 'till Conviction came to him on a DeathBedFre∣quenting the  EssexHead Society  he was considered by all as a fine Speaker and close Reasoner No Christian dared enter the Lists with our Unbeliever but if rash and impetuous by Chance any one at∣tempted it he was sure of being foiled  IN this Manner he went on 'till he ar∣rived at the Age of Forty happy in his Vices and perfectly convinced of their Innocence His deistical Notions were confirmed by the Authority of many Writers of the first Note and many Speakers of the same Sentiments that attended the Society and they encouraged  each other in them and from Time to Time entertained the World with their Productions in Order as themselves ob∣served that the Cause of Truth should be propagated and Bigotry and Superstition be banished from the World  A MELANCHOLY Sequel remains to complete the Story Shall I relate or leave the Imagination to guess at the Power of Sickness and the Prospect of DeathNo there is no Occasion Suffice it to say that the witty the face∣tious the learned POMPONIUS retracted the Opinions he had espoused and declared that he  felt  Christianity was no empty Name no Juggle or Trick put upon Mankind by artful Priests to fetter Rea∣son and impose on the Senses but a sub∣stantial Good which its Professors may possess but of which he could entertain no Idea but from the Despair and Horror he felt from the Want of itThese Things he now declared but  where  de∣clared them Alas on a Bed from whence he never more arose into this World His immortal Spirit freed from its Imprison∣ment in the Body entered the Regions of Eternity  A VERY different Kind of Being was that whose History I shall now give GRIPUS was born of very mean and poor Parents at  Shiffnall  in  Shropshire  who with great Difficulty brought him up to a Knowledge of Reading and Writing At the Age of thirteen he was put Ap∣prentice to a Perukemaker and on his Arrival to his twentysecond Year with eleven Shillings and nine Pence only he set out for  London  On his coming to this great City and examining into the State of his Finances he found he had one Shilling and three Pence Halspenny left With that Sum he determined to try his Fortune and looked out for a Place in the Capacity of a Journeyman Barber His Endeavours were crown'd with Success He found a Place and he was happy Nine Months he continued here and saved up the Sum of seven Pounds nine Shillings It was a Fortune to him and he resolv'd to improve it but not in the Business he was bred to for he found it would not answer his Purpose With seven Pounds and nine Shillings only GRIPUS enter'd  the Alley  and took on him a Business he knew nothing of but he had heard that small Sums had pro∣duced  immense Fortunes in it He was ignorant and illiterate to the last Degree had no Accomplishments that could re∣commend him to the Notice of the World or rescue him according to all Probability from that low and mean State he had been bred in and was then subject to  AS Fortune is hoodwink'd and re∣gardless of the Merits of her Suitors it frequently happens that the Unworthy are admitted into her Temple and re∣ceiv'd as her peculiar Favourites while the Learned and Ingenious languish in Ob∣scurity or drag a heavy galling Chain condemn'd to Penury and Want GRIPUS experienced the Truth of this Observation With not a single Qualification that could intitle him to the Regard of any one or rescue him from the servile and ignomi∣nious State he had been used to he met with great Success and abounded in Af∣fluence Wealth flow'd in fast upon him while Men of infinitely greater Merit were sinking beneath a Load of Misfor∣tunes and patiently enduring the Frowns of Fortune The  Alley  prov'd a real Friend to him and his Substance conti∣nually increased As he grew more weal∣thy he was more parsimonious and he  seldom or never spent more than three Halfpence for his Breakfast three Pence Halfpenny for his Dinner and three Halfpence for a Nipperkin of home∣brewed either at the Crooked Billet in  Shire Lane  or the Welch Harp in  Full∣wood's Rents  IN about twenty Years he had amassed together the Sum of Twenty Thousand Pounds with the greatest Part of which he purchased an Estate in  Shropshire  and laid out the Remainder in the Stocks His Substance like a Snowball was conti∣nually increasing and with it the Desire of more Like the Grave his Lust for Money was boundless and he endea∣vour'd to obtain it by all the Means in his Power  ON his Arrival to his fortyseventh Year Curiosity brought him to the  Essex Head  and Avarice kept him there Sixpence a Night was indeed more than he had made it a Rule to spend but for that Sixpence he might drink a Gallon or two of good Porter and on the Days he went there he took Care to drink none any where else so that he justly  consider'd that if he drank but three full Pots he was Threepence Gainer  IT can scarcely be expected that such a  Genius  as I am describing could be an Orator but he was as good a Drinker as any of them and though he could neither speak to a Question or comprehend the Force of any Argument yet while the Debates were held he could amuse him∣self with his Tankard and smoke his Pipe and after they were finished could for two or three Hours longer smoke his Pipe and amuse himself with his Tan∣kardand all for Sixpence  IN this Manner old GRIPUS went on 'till the last Day of his Life the Jest of Fools the Contempt of Coxcombs the Pity of Men of Sense and the Detestation of his Relations though indeed these latter being needy paid him some Court and shewed him some Respect which his Wealth not his Merit extorted mere  "MouthHonour which the poor Heart would fain have denied"  GRIPUS had many Relations who stood in Need of his Bounty but insen∣sible  to every Thing but the Lust of Mo∣ney dead to all the social Feelings of the Soul he cared not a Straw if his Kindred and all Mankind were at the Bottom of the Sea so that he could stand safely on Land survey the Scene and like a  Sussex  or  Cornish  Savage pillage the Wreck  A LENGTH of Years however weigh'd him down at last and he fell ill Death was written in his Face and he was pro∣nounced incurable The Landlord in whose House he had for many Years lodged by Way of Cheapness had Two Hundred Pounds in his Hands belonging to GRIPUS and this Sum he determin'd by some Artifice to appropriate to his own Use How this was to be obtain'd was the grand Question and well worthy the Contriver's Genius WILL was no less a Miser than GRIPUS and had by keeping a mean beggarly CoffeeHouse in a dirty Lane saved up Three or Four Thousand Pounds but he consider'd that Two Hundred would be a good Ad∣dition to it The Scheme being at length duly adjusted WILL made his Appear∣ance before GRIPUS attended by two Witnesses who were to stand concealed hear the Discourse and if necessary give  in Evidence of it  "I have Two Hun∣dred Pounds of yours in my Hands Mr GRIPUS said WILL and I want to know what I must do with it"  GRIPUS rack'd with Pain and scarce sensible of any Thing replied  "Keep it yourself"  A Wink of the Eye and a Projection of the Hand now were necessary to bring the two Witnesses forward They came  "What must I do with the Two Hundred Pounds Mr GRIPUS As you are now in all Pro∣bability on a Deathbed it is best to settle these Affairs"  "You may keep it yourself answer'd the sick Man"  "Then you give and bestow the Two Hundred Pounds on me don't you"  "I do reply'd he"  This was sufficient WILL hasten'd down Stairs had an Affidavit drawn of the Legacy given him and in a short Time after GRIPUS expired That GRIPUS who lived despised and hated and died unlamented  ANOTHER Member of the Society was Father MURTAGH O'FLAHERTY a Popish Priest  Ireland  gave him Birth St  Omer  's Education and  England  a good Income He had for a long Time  after his Return from St  Omer  's resided in the North of  Ireland  and was look'd on as a very learned and able Divine The Aged revered him for his Judgment and the Youthful for his gay and lively Dispo∣sition freed from the Austerity and Ri∣gour that frequently make Wisdom odious MURTAGH would demonstrate with the greatest Clearness that Mirth and Chear∣fulness were not in the least inconsistent with Religion that a Bottle of good Claret fortified the Body and raised the Spirits and that the Joys which a good Tavern and boon Companions afford were not to be despised by Men of Sense  IN Consequence of this natural Propen∣sity this longing Desire to be happy and to make others so Father MURTAGH would frequent Clubs and sing Catches speak Speeches drink Toasts break Glas∣ses and tell merry Stories with any one And though some rigid Priests and severe Moralists would censure him behind his Back for his immoral Conduct as they term'd it yet when he appear'd before them he had such a pretty Way such a forcible Method of vindicating his Beha∣viour and winning their Affections that  they could not find in their Hearts to blame him  BUT with such Accomplishments if he was a Favourite of the Men what must he be with the Women They per∣fectly idolized him and in Return Fa∣ther MURTAGH had no less Passion and Veneration for them Indeed there was another Circumstance which though it may be deem'd a Trifle by some Folks had a wonderful Effect in forcing the Af∣fections of the Fair As he acted in the Character of a Confessor to rivet the Esteem of his Penitents he used Lenity instead of Severity and in Cases where some Confessors would have scourged with a Rod of Iron he rebuked with the Mildness of a Father and exhorted them to a contrary Conduct if they would avoid his just Indignation These lenient and gentle Methods prevail'd where rough and violent ones would not The human Mind is rather won by Entreaty than dragged by Force and receives Conviction from a Friend that soothes its Anguish and makes Allowance for its Frailties when by a contrary Conduct venial Er∣ror might rise to Guilt and youthful In∣dulgence  terminate in confirmed Wicked∣ness and obstinate Villainy  FATHER MURTAGH being such a pro∣fessed Admirer of the Fair and treating them with such Mildness he had so won their Hearts that they resounded his Praises continually They insisted on it he was the best Priest in the Kingdom the most learned and judicious Man and infinitely the best qualified to be a Confes∣sor In short they would confess to no one but Father MURTAGH Father MURTAGH was the universal Cry  THIS Trade continued so long that a Conspiracy was formed by his envious Bre∣thren against his Monopoly and by Force of Bribes and Numbers he fell a Victim to popular Wrath and priestly Artifice  FOR a long Time the good Man poor and friendless wandered about a melan∣choly Proof of the unhappy Fate that may attend Men of the greatest Parts and of the Want of Gratitude for past Favours when the Power of continuing them is taken away  FINDING he could scarcely support him∣self in  Ireland  he came to  London  and soon formed an Acquaintance with many People of his own Religion An  Irish  Roman Catholick Priest need never fear wanting a BeefSteak and a Pot of Porter for his Dinner in  London  Nay he need not fear wanting Venison or Ortolans and good Claret There are Abundance of Papists in this City who regard their Priests as so many DemiGods and who will think themselves as highly honoured with their Presence at Dinner or Supper as BAUCIS and PHILEMON thought them∣selves by the Presence of their heavenly Guest and in consequence of this Opi∣nion the Markets are ransacked for the choicest Viands and the Wine Vaults for the best Wines to entertain them As stolen Interviews between Lovers are the sweetest so the Necessity the Roman Ca∣tholic Clergy are under to keep themselves concealed in order to gain Proselytes and pervert the People to their Religion give a Relish to their Entertainments which they would otherwise want  FATHER MURTAGH soon saved up a good deal of Money and lived as elegantly  as his Heart could wish He attended eve∣ry  Monday  night at the  EssexHead  spoke to the Questions in the Character of a Pro∣testant yet could not help betraying the cloven Foot on some Occasions After the Debates of the Evening were over and the Company entered into private Conferences with each other Father  Murtagh  would single out that Person whom he conceived most fit for his Purpose and use the greatest Industry and exert all his Abilities to de∣preciate the established Religion of this Kingdom and extol that of the Roman Catholic and his Endeavours were often successful  HE is now very old and having for many Years attended at the  EssexHead Society  he comes to the  Robinhood  but not con∣stantly on Account of his Age and Infir∣mities  BOB SCAMPER was a Man very different from the three I have been de∣scribing BOB was born in the West of  England  and was reckoned a Youth of enterprising Genius and ready Parts At the Age of eighteen he came to  London  and having spent the five Guineas he brought up with him on Women of the Town  was greatly at a Loss to what to betake himself Poverty stared him in the Face and tho' he had some good natural Parts and a great Assurance yet having no Learn∣ing he could get no genteel Employment His Female associates however soon fur∣nished Hints which a Lad of his ready Wit and enterprising Spirit easily understood and as intrepidly executed He turned Collector on the Road and having Suc∣cess rioted in the Spoils he had taken and with his Girls enjoyed all the Happiness he desired Not but that sometimes it was dashed with some Remorse and the Dread of the fatal Consequences that might ensue But Excess of drinking the Company of Libertines and the Conversation of his Women dispersed the Clouds that obscured his Happiness and confirmed him in the Resolution he had taken to plunder and rob the Public and to gain a Livelihood by the bold Hands of Violence  A CONTINUANCE in Wickedness fa∣miliarises the Mind to it and what at first a Man would start even to think of he at length practises without Horror All Guilt is progressive We go not at once but Step by Step into the Extremes of Vice and tho' it is impossible to silence the Cries  of Conscience and to stifle the Dictates of Reason all at once yet an habitual Viola∣tion of their Admonitions brings us to an Insensibility of the Horror of our Crimes and renders us quite callous to the Sense of Shame and deaf to every Thing but the importunate Cravings of sensual Appetite  BOB SCAMPER experienced the Truth of these Observations In the DayTime he mounted his Horse and robbed on the Highway with the same Composure as any other Man follows  his  customary Occupation and at Night he spent the ill∣got Treasure among Whores and Thieves the Encouragers of his Wickedness and the Sharers of his Spoils  THIS was a worthy Member of a So∣ciety that met to improve themselves by free and candid Inquiry but Captain SCAMPER as he was intitled was well received by all He was a tall handsome Fellow endued with a Power of Face that disdained a Blush and though not wise was witty though not learned was ingeni∣ous and had a Power of imposing on the Understandings of those he conversed with and making them believe him to be what he was not He dressed well had a free  and  degagée  Air wanted not Words and addressed the Passions of those he conversed with with such Skill and Success that you could not help giving him Credit for much more Understanding than he pos∣sessed  THERE are two Kinds of People that are better thought of in most Companies than their intrinsic Merit deserves These are the solemn Prig and welldressed Cox∣comb The first by the Help of a full∣trimmed grave Suit and a large Peruque a sagacious Look and a slow Deli∣very shall make you take him for a second SOLON The most unmeaning Speech the tritest Observation the most superficial Hint delivered in a dry yet important slow but solemn Tone and enforced by some shakes of the Head shrugs of the Shoulders and significant HandOratory shall be received as the Dictates of Wisdom and procure the Speaker the Character of the SOLOMON of the Age  THE other aided by his Taylor Mil∣lener and Barber tho' he gives Vent to the Fulness of his Soul only by dry Jokes and insipid Remarks is yet listened to with  Attention and heard with Pleasure No one will dare to contradict the Assertions of a Wit with laced Cloaths BagWig and a Sword and thus Folly is received for Wisdom and vivacious Impudence for Ge∣nius  SCAMPER was to be ranked in this second Class of Orators He spoke to eve∣ry Question and tho' what he said had no great Depth or much Meaning in it yet being delivered from the Mouth of a Man that was extremely well dressed and with no bad Accent or ill Grace it was always well received and the Speaker was con∣sidered as a very great  Genius  and an Or∣nament to the Society  BUT this Ornament of the Society did not last above five Years and a Half He had committed a Robbery on  HounslowHeath  and taken a Booty of no less than three Hundred Guineas The Gentle∣man he had robbed happened accidentally to come to the  EssexHead  one  Monday  Evening and the Moment he entered the Room Captain SCAMPER had got up to speak to the Question The Question was  Whether the Doctrine of Repentance taught by the Christian Religion has not a manifest Tendency to encourage Wickedness  DEISTICUS  SCAMPER after desiring the Presi∣dent to read the Question again spoke to it in the best Manner he could He vindi∣cated Christianity in general and demon∣strated that all its Doctrines tended to the Support of Morality by discountenancing all Manner of Vice He shewed its su∣perior Excellency over all the Religions that had ever appeared in the World he proved the Authenticity of the Sacred Writings and defied the Deists with all their Ingenuity to point out any Defects in them He observed of our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount that as it compre∣hended in one concise View all the Doc∣trines and Precepts of Christiany so it was the most sublime System of Ethics in the World He took Notice that not only the Philosophers and Sages of the Heathen World considered abstractedly were un∣able to form a complete System of moral Duties but that all their Writings put to∣gether were insufficient to form such a System and that if all their Morality was  to be extracted that is all their Excellen∣cies to be reduced into a System it would still be an imperfect one He then spoke more immediately to the Question and deli∣vered it as his Opinion that the Doctrine of Repentance as taught by the established Church of which he said he was not a∣shamed to own himself a Member so far from encouraging Wickedness had the greatest Tendency imaginable to annihilate it for he observed that the Repentance taught in the Gospel is not merely a Sor∣row for our past Sins but likewise a Reso∣lution of reforming our Conduct for the fu∣ture As to the Objection that had been brought by a Deist who observed that Repentance was no Atonement he said it was very true if we speak as Deists but if we believe as Christians it must be looked on as an Atonement since GOD in those Books which Christians believe were writ∣ten by his Inspiration has been graciously pleased to declare he will receive it as such Our Duty he observed without Doubt it was always incumbent on us to practise and after the Commission of the greatest Sins and our sincere Repentance of them we perform no more than our Duty by living a Righteous and a Holy Life But as the Deity had declared to  every one even the greatest of Sinners that though his Crimes were as red as Scarlet yet by Repentance the should be made as white as Snow it is certainly a Doctrine that encourages the Soul and supports it under the Reproaches of Conscience that would otherwise whip us with her Scor∣pions and throw us into the Agonies of Despair and Horror He concluded by drawing a Contrast between the Repen∣tance of the Protestant and the Absolution of the Roman Catholic Church and in∣sisted that the former tended to our spi∣ritual and temporal Welfare and the latter to the Destruction of both  DURING all the Time this great Advo∣cate for Religion and Morality was speak∣ing the Gentleman eyed him attentively and thought he had seen him somewhere before He went up close to him and after a minute examination of his Person and Manner at length recollected that it was on  HounslowHeath  he had the Mis∣fortune to have seen him Without saying any Thing to him or to the Company he withdrew and in about a Quarter of an Hour returned with his Servant who was present at the Robbery and with a Con∣stable who was to take Care of SCAM∣PER  if the Servant agreed with his Master in the Identity of the Person  THE Servant had no sooner entered the Room than without his Master's pointing the Object out he swore that the tall Gen∣tleman in laced Cloaths near the Presi∣dent was the Man that robbed his Master on  HounslowHeath  This was sufficient The Constable went up to him and tap∣ping him on the Shoulder said he should be glad to speak to him The Captain obeyed and they withdrew out of the DisputingRoom attended by the Gentle∣man and his Servant They had no sooner reached the Stairs than SCAMPER wanted to know the Gentleman's Commands  "Oh says the Constable there is a Coach waiting at the Door and if you'll enter it you'll know presently"  SCAMPER declin'd it but the Constable was importunate and being somewhat irritated at his Obstinacy told him he  must  enter it The Captain stared bit his Lips and was mute The Gentleman and his Servant now came up and the latter opening the CoachDoor waited for his Master to enter But he was too complaisant to go in before the Captain and bowing to him asked him to go in  first The Captain still declin'd it and they insisted on it in a higher Tone and declar'd that he should go whether he would or not Already was half the Captain's Sword out of the Scabbard and he had resolv'd to resist their utmost Efforts when a Whistle from the Constable made him stare and of a Sudden suspend his Action Immediately three strapping Fel∣lows came up and the Constable pointing to SCAMPER and telling them to do their Duty they took away his Sword hurried him into the Coach the Gentleman his Servant and the Constable following and drove off to Justice DE VEIL'S  I SHALL not multiply Words The Gentleman and his Servant swore positively that he was the Person that robb'd them on  Hounslow Heath  He was search'd A Powder Horn a Pair of Pistols a Mask and some other Things were found on him His Mittimus was made and he was sent to  Newgate  IN a Fortnight Abundance of People swore to their being robb'd by him and by means of some of his Girls three of his Confederates were taken and sent to bear him Company In due Time their Trials  came on at the  Old Baily  and they were found guilty and sentenced to be hang'd  SCAMPER had very little Hopes of gaining a Reprieve yet did not prepare for Death in the Manner he ought His favourite Doctrine Repentance he hardly thought of at least he did not practise it He drank to such Excess that when the Hour came that he was to suffer an igno∣minious Death in the Sight of a nume∣rous and gaping Populace he seem'd quite insensible of his Fate  HE was put into the Cart with his Companions and they were driven to  Tyburn  The fatal Rope was fasten'd round their Necksthe Ordinary told them they were going to another Worldthe Cart was driven awayand they were left suspended in the Air  THUS perish'd BOB SCAMPER a Man of no mean Abilities but who prostituted them to infamous Purposes and lived an immoral vicious Life though ever ha∣ranguing in the Society on the Beauty of Holiness and the Necessity of RepentanceI wish this were not a common Case in the World  ANOTHER Member of the Society not less worthy than this was TOM RAKE∣WELL TOM after having receiv'd an Education that barely enabled him to read and write was sent from the West of  England  to  London  and there bound Ap∣prentice to a Grocer But TOM'S Genius was not to be confin'd within so narrow a Channel He soared to higher Things and was ambitious enough to attempt get∣ting on the Stage where all his Desires were placed and all his Hopes terminated He offer'd himself to FLEETWOOD the Manager and was refused Not daunted however at this Repulse he ran away from his Master in the third Year of his Apprenticeship went to  Norwich  where a Company of Strollers were then per∣forming made a Tender of his Services and was accepted The pitiful Income of a strolling Player was too scanty for our Hero and the Debts he had contracted were so numerous and his Creditors so pressing that  Norwich  became quickly too hot to hold him He therefore set out from that Place for  Newcastle upon Tyne  where there was another Company of Players But to enable himself to travel with greater Conveniency he took with  him as large a Bundle of the Manager's Cloaths as he could carry and set out early in the Morning in a PostChaise  HE quickly converted his Effects into ready Money and reach'd  Newcastle  in two Days But he was soon forced to decamp The News of his being there having reached his  quondam  Companions at  Norwich  a Hue and Cry was raised and two of the Actors were sent to  Newcastle  to apprehend him RAKEWELL by some Means had Intelligence of their Arrival and guessed their Errand but declin'd the Honour of their Company by leaving the Town so precipitately that he had not even Time to pay the Landlord of the Inn he had set up at a Score of thirtyseven shillings  FROM hence he went to  Exeter  at which Town he was born and going to his Father told him a long Story of his Master's ill Usage and of the Impossibility of his living with him His Father pro∣duced a Letter from his Master informing him of his Son's running away without any Cause but of his Readiness to pardon him if he would return The Father and Son had now a great Contest and the Master's  Letter had greater Weight with the old Man than the Son's Assertions He however promised RAKEWELL that he would write to his Master in his Favour and that 'till he could receive an Answer he might stay with him The Son ac∣quiesced with the Proposal seem'd pleased with it and the old Man immediately wrote extenuating his Son's Guilt and apologizing for the Misconduct which the Weakness incident to Youth had drawn him into  THREE Days after TOM got up at One in the Morning and opening a Bu∣reau found a Purse with no less than fiftyseven Guineas in it being the poor old Man's whole Fortune and which he had been hoarding up ever since his Son was first sent to  London  out of the small Profits that accrued to him from a little Trade he had as a Perukemaker This was a Fortune to the overjoyed Youth and putting it safe in his Pocket he took his Stick and walk'd 'till Seven in the Morning very briskly when he had reach'd **** Here he breakfasted and the StageCoach coming by he agreed with the Driver for his Passage to  London  HE had no sooner arriv'd at the Metro∣polis than the Scenes he had before been engag'd in were renew'd and the same Pranks play'd over again While he was in his Apprenticeship an indulgent Master had permitted him after the Business of the Night was over and Shop was shut to spend his Evenings abroad A Youth of such a Disposition as TOM had it may naturally be imagin'd did not spend them in very good Company nor very inno∣cently The Houses he frequented were either Brothels or NightHouses and the Company consisted of wild and thoughtless young Apprentices like him∣self or thoroughpaced Rogues who ini∣tiated the young ones into all the iniquitous Schemes and Arts they were Masters of Tutors of Villainy like these for whom  Tyburn  groans abound in Houses of this Sort and young Scholars attend there in great Numbers  TOM keeping very bad Hours was fre∣quently lock'd out but after he had the Experience of three Weeks Learning from a Veteran he knew how to seduce his Master's Maid and to prevail on her to let him in at any Hour This Kindness went not unrewarded To discharge his  Obligations to her TOM robb'd his Master of Tea Sugar Spices and Snuff  THIS was a pretty Life which he now not only renew'd but improv'd He be∣came a complete Buck and Blood sallied out every Night in Quest of Adventures beat the Watch bullied Constables de∣molished Lamps kicked Waiters bilked BawdyHouses and went Home reeling to Bed  ABOUT the Time he return'd to  London  from  Exeter  he attended the  EssexHead Society  Their Debates charmed him and he thought if he could be admitted a Member of so respectable and learned a Body he should be quite happy If Hap∣piness consisted in being a Member he was soon in Possession of it for he was chosen  Nem Con  RAKEWELL had a great Talent for Disputation He had a ready Wit great Volubility of Speech and wanted not for a consummate Assurance These Accomplishments must have endeared him greatly to the Society and he was look'd on as a valuable Acquisition It is true there was no Solidity of Judgment no Depth of Knowledge in him any more  than in his Friend SCAMPER but he had no less Art in exciting the Admiration of the Superficial and the Ignorant a vast Body of Men and in making his Tinsel Ornaments pass for real Plate  RAKEWELL's chief Fort was Re∣ligion He distinguish'd himself greatly on Subjects of this Kind and was thought to be as good an Orthodox Member as any in the Society He combated the Deists with the invincible Armour of Revealed Religion and played off the great Guns of Mysteries against them with no little Success As the Doctrine of  occult Causes  is the greatest Friend of Metaphysicians and natural Philosophers and serves as a Retreat for them where no Foes can enter so when pressed by Argument or urged by Authority the Deists would demand Reasons for Assertions and Proofs for  Ipse Dixits  RAKEWELL would prudently retire from the Charge and tell them that where Faith begins Reason endsthat the Natural Man cannot comprehend Spi∣ritual Subjectsthat what is an Object of Faith cannot be intelligible by Reasonand that though Revealed Religion may seem above Reason yet it is not against it These and many other Answers of the like Kind he gave to the Heterodox  Gentry and ever shew'd an inviolable Resolution to defend Religion in general and the Establish'd Church in particular against all the Attacks of their Foes In Consequence of which the Society look'd on him as an honourable Member and a very learned and ingenious Man After Debates on such Subjects and Holy Ar∣guments alledged in Favour of his Opi∣nions our Orator would leave the Society and proceed to his usual Night Entertain∣ments of breaking the Lamps and going Home to his Girls where he rioted in Excess of Wickedness  BY some Means or other RAKEWELL had got acquainted with an old Maiden Lady worth no less than Thirteen Hun∣dred Pounds After paying his Addresses to her for some Time he gain'd her Heart and a Day was proposed for Marriage The antiquated Virgin not doubting the Ho∣nour of her Lover the Day before the intended Marriage transferr'd over her whole Fortune to him The Lover was now happy He sold out the Thirteen Hundred Pounds Old South Sea An∣nuities and Three per Cent Bank An∣nuities immediately With the Money these produced he set up a Chariot and Pair took genteel Lodgings in  PallMall  and appear'd in every Respect as a Man of Fortune quite regardless of the Attempts that might be made on him by the Sons of Law and hoping to find out some other wealthy Dame with whom he might meet with equal Success  BUT though RAKEWELL was safe with Respect to the Revenge threaten'd him by the Lady he had tricked and her Friends yet his high Living and Extravagance soon dissipated his Substance and he was at a Loss what to do Paying ready Money for some Time however induced Trades∣men to give him Credit and having run in Tick to the Amount of Three Hundred Pounds with various People and being dunned and threatened several Times by the most Importunate of them he was in∣duced to shift his Quarters to go away from his Lodgings without settling with his Landlord or his Footman for he kept one to the last and set out again for  Exeter  ON his Arrival there he told his Father a miserable Story of his having been rob∣bed of Five Hundred Guineas of his ha∣ving a Combat with the Highwaymen that had robbed him and of his having em∣ploy'd several active Fellows to go in Search of them His Father seeing him  welldressed and appear more like a Lord than  his  Son testified his Joy at his Re∣turn RAKEWELL then voluntarily men∣tioned his having robbed him of fiftyseven Guineas and putting a Bill in his Hand drawn on the most eminent Banker in  London  for One Hundred Pounds told him he was not to look on that as a Re∣compence in full but as an Earnest only of what he should receive He then in∣formed him of his having married a Lady worth Twenty Thousand Pounds but a Fortnight ago that he was then going to  Penzance  to settle Affairs with her Guar∣dian and would return to  London  in five Days where his Lady impatiently expect∣ed him  THE good old Man was so overjoy'd at hearing this Account of his Son's good Fortune that he fell on his Neck and kissed him and with Tears in his Eyes told him that he was glad to hear of his Success in Life but that he had no Occa∣sion for the Hundred Pounds he had given him he having by his Care and Industry since his leaving him last saved up Twen∣tyseven Pounds and therefore he begged him to take back again his generous Gift of a Hundred Pounds as till his Affairs were settled he might have Occasion for it  BUT this RAKEWELL declined and observed that the Trifle he had given him he could well spare that he insisted on his keeping it and that in a Fort∣night he might have the Pleasure of treb∣ling it to him The old Man filled with Joy at seeing such a Son seemed perfectly happy went about to his Friendstold them of his Son's good Fortuneinvited them to his Housebought the greatest Dainties he could possibly procureand at Eight at Night the House was full of Guests drinking Wine Punch and Beer while roast Geese were at the Fire Fowls in the Pot and some other substantial Dishes provided to entertain the Friends on the Prodigal's Return a Prodigal that had been guilty of some Er∣rors that had been bred in Obscurity and was now raised to great Grandeur  THE Evening was spent in great Jolity and all but RAKEWELL were perfecty in∣toxicated After all the Company was gone the old Man whose Heart was now quite merry went to a private Clo∣set took out a Bottle of excellent Citron Water and desired his Son to take a Glass The Son obeyed him and the Father fol∣lowed the Example One Glass intro∣duced  another another followed and in short the Duumvirate emptied the Bottle The Son was now what they call halfseas over but the old Man was so intoxicated he could heither sit or stand With some Difficulty RAKEWELL got him tobed took the Key out of the Door locked it and thenwent down Stairs  HE began now to ransack the House immediately seized the old Man's twentyseven Pounds and took every Thing away he could conveniently carry He then went to the Inn he had put up at on his first coming to Town ordered a Post Chaise and told the Driver to go on as fast as he could  A CHANGE of Chaises soon brought him to  London  and it happening to be on a  Monday  Night he attended at the  EssexHead Society  and spoke to the Question which was  Whether even in this World a vicious and immoral Man is not severely pu∣nished And if Virtue distressed does not feel greater Happiness than exal∣ted Vice  PLATO  RAKEWELL took the Affirmative Side of the Question and proved beyond all Manner of Contradiction that Vice and Immorality met with its Punishment by inflicting the Stings of Conscience at pre∣sent and the Dread of future Pain Not that this Doctrine he observed tended in the least to set aside that of a future Retri∣bution of Rewards and Punishments in another State where as we are taught by the Christian Religion that Suffering Virtue will meet its ample Reward and Triumphant Vice be suitably punished But the Commission of good Actions and the Consciousness of our having performed our Duty gave a placid Serenity to our Minds and a Composure to our Thoughts A Felicity which the Huzzas of applau∣ding Thousands could not give nor the Hisses of detracting and bitter Enemies take away He took Notice also of the Distresses and Agonies of Mind a wicked Man always laboured under through a Fear of being exposed and his Wicked∣ness revealed to the World which would consequentially draw on him the severe Penalties of the Law and the just Detes∣tation of Mankind He insisted on it that the continual Apprehensions of Disco∣very a wicked Man must be under and  the Terrors of an abused Conscience must prevent the Approaches of Happiness and dash the Cup of Pleasure with a great De∣gree of nauseous and bitter Herbs He then launched out into the Pleasures of Vir∣tue and Religion and made it appear that their Votaries reaped greater Satis∣faction and tasted a more homefelt Plea∣sure than could possibly result from the highest Gratifications of sensual Appetite or mere Animal Bliss To prove these Assertions he quoted a few Authors he had either read or heard of as Enforcers of his Sentiments and as Authors of his Doc∣trine A great Name frequently proves more than a sound Argument and People with whom Learning and Reason have no Sort of Weight are yet prevailed on to resign their Judgments and to give up their Opinions to an Antient whom Time has sanctified or to an illustrious Ortho∣dox Writer whose Notions and Senti∣ments have been honoured and embraced by the World  THE Speech RAKEWELL delivered was well received and the Society thought no one could excel him in Propriety of Thought or Regularity of Conduct Af∣ter the Debates were over RAKEWELL left the Society and traversed the Streets  till he met with a Female he liked and with whom he went to the most conveni∣ent Bagnio  IN this Manner he continued for some Time an unaccountable Aenigma which none was able to solve But being at ength discovered to have robbed a Gentle∣man of Eminence in  GrosvenorSquare  he was tried convicted and condemned and executed at  Tyburn  at the very Time that his Colleague and Companion the facetious BOB SCAMPER sufferedThus was the Society deprived of two of their best Members the most powerful and ornamental Pillars of their Fabric  FOR some short Time after this the So∣ciety was observed to dwindle away and its staunch Advocates and firm Friends be∣gan to fear that its Dissolution was nigh Some imputed it to the Absence of two of their best Speakers and the Despair the Public in general had of hearing any Thing debated on by able Orators now the best were gone Some imagined that the melancholy Fate of those two Mem∣bers deterred People from attending a So∣ciety on which they had once reflected such Honour and which was now disgraced by  their ignominious Death and some were earnestly wishing for its Annihilation  IT was not long however before the Fears of the one Party and the Hopes of the other were turned into Certainty The Society triumphed their Friends rejoiced and their Enemies were disappointed  To give a long Detail of every Event that happened in this Society to particu∣larize all their Proceedings and to cha∣racterize all their Members would exceed the Bounds I have prescribed myself and would be uncommonly tedious I shall therefore only observe that from the Time the Society was removed to the  EssexHead  it increased both in Num∣bers and in Reputation and so well was it known that Gentlemen who lived in the Country as well as Foreigners of all Nations if in the least curious learned or ingenious resorted to it to hear De∣bates that had so much attracted the At∣tention and extorted the Admiration of the World  End of the SECOND PART  THE HISTORY OF THE  Robinhood Society  PART III  I  N the Year the Society was removed to the  Robinhood  in  ButcherRow  at that Time kept by Mr HALL The Room here was vastly more convenient than the other New Benches were made in or∣der that a greater Number of People might be admitted a Branch for eighteen  Candles was suspended from the Ceiling a large Chair for the President curiously gilt was erected a Box to keep the Book of Questions was provided a Hammer was purchased for the President and in short every Thing that was necessary to reflect Splendor on the Society and to accommodate its Visitants in the best Manner was obtain'd by the industrious Landlord who had formed great Hopes of adding a Reputation to his House and en∣riching himself from the vast Concourse of People he expected would assemble there  IN order to convey the best Idea I can of this famous Society to the Mind of the Reader I apprehend it is necessary for me to give a fuller Account of the Manage∣ment of it than I have before done  EVERY Person that attended it was to pay Sixpence and that while these Disputants were enriching their Minds with the Treasures of Knowledge they might also practise the Godlike Virtue of Charity they agreed that out of every Sixpence the Landlord should be paid Fourpence for each Quart of Lemonade and Porter Three Halfpence should be  set by and appropriated to charitable Uses to be agreed on by a select Com∣mittee appointed for that Purpose and the remaining Halfpenny should be paid to the Clerk as a Recompence for the Trouble he was put to in receiving each Person's Ticket and taking Care that the Society in general and the Dispu∣tants in particular were duly serv'd with Liquor  A PERPETUAL President was also ap∣pointed whose Name was JEACOCKE who was to act as Moderator and who had indeed given great Satisfactio nin that Character at the  EssexHead  for four Years His Duty consisted in reading whatever Questions were proposed for Consideration and offering them separately to the Choice of the Members Those who chose that a Question should be ad∣mitted and enter'd in the Book were to signify it by holding up their Hands and those who did not think it a proper Ques∣tion were to signify their Opinion in the same Manner and the Majority carried it After this Part of his Duty he was to read the Question for the Night's De∣bate and then ask the several Members whether they chose to speak to it begin∣ning  with the Person who sat next to his left Hand and proceeding all round the Room 'till he came to the Person who sat next his right Hand When any Person got up to speak he was also to take Mi∣nutes of what he conceiv'd to be of par∣ticular Importance and by thus collecting the different Sentiments of different People he was enabled when it came to his Turn to speak to enforce the Arguments that strengthen'd his own Opinion and invali∣date those that were against it If no Person thought proper to own a Question or to confess himself the Proposer of it then the President was the adopted Father and he open'd the Question by explaining the Terms of it and concluded the De∣bates on it by a Speech of his own but if the Author of the Question own'd it then the Person next to his left Hand spoke to it and it was to go round in due Order and the Proposer concluded it The Pre∣sident was likewise to keep Order and De∣corum in the Society to prevent any personal Altercations or mean Invectives to make them stick to the Point to bring them back when they went astray to see likewise with the Clerk that the Society was well supplied with Liquor and in short to do every Thing that was for  the Interest of the Society and the Good of the Members present  BY this Account of the Duty of the President it will appear that his Trouble every Night was not little It is always difficult to keep a promiscuous Company in good Order and a Society like the ROBINHOOD where every one is ad∣mitted for his Sixpence must be liable to many Irregularities But though the Pre∣sident's Trouble was so great yet his Attachment to and Veneration for the Society was such that unlike the inte∣rested Conduct of most other Presidents he acted  Gratis  contenting himself only with the Honour of the Office  ONCE a Year a Paper was publish'd by the Society containing a Justification of it from the Sneers of Witlings and the Sarcasms of some satirical Authors and setting forth its Nature and Tendency and underneath it was an Account of the Number of People that had attended it all the Year distinguishing the particular Number that met each  Monday  Night This was thought more likely to vindicate their Conduct and wipe off the Asper∣sions that had been thrown on them than  an elaborate Defence since by seeing what a vast Number of People attended each Night amounting in a Year's Time to upwards of Five Thousand on a mo∣derate Computation the Public might perceive that no less than Five Thousand three Halfpennies were distributed in Cha∣rity amounting to  l    s  And even supposing that the Society could not vie in Splendor with the ROYAL SOCIETY or in Dignity with the ANTIQUARIAN or in Numbers with the SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF ARTS MANU∣FACTURES AND COMMERCE and even granting their Antagonists Assertions to be true that it was a Receptacle for the Illiterate and the Impious where horrid and blasphemous Notions were defended and propagated and where Religion and Virtue were trodden under Foot yet still it may be urged from great Authority that Charity  covers  a Multitude of Sins  THE Society now advancing in its Reputation and some of the most distin∣guished Wits and Scholars frequenting it it greatly excited the public Attention There was scarce a public Paper but in the Course of its Animadversions the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY was taken Notice  of Doctor HENLEY vindicated it from his Rostrum and comparing it to some of the famed Assemblies of Yore where a CICERO or a DEMOSTHENES harangued he affirm'd it to be of the most eminent Service to Mankind by mending their Morals enlarging their Knowledge and refining their Taste that it was infinitely preferable consider'd as a School of Ora∣tory to the Bar or the Senate and that it excell'd the Pulpit both with Respect to the Advancement of TRUE RELIGION and the spreading of Human Knowledge Nay he affirm'd it to be the Sun of the intellectual and moral World that with its radiant Beams enlighten'd chear'd and vivified the Spiritual System as the Fir∣mamental Sun doth the NaturalIn short he undertook to vindicate it from his Rostrum in  Lincoln'sInn Fields  from all the Calumnies and Aspersions that ever had been or could be raised against it and insisted on its being the most perfect human Institution that was ever form'd excepthis own Oratory  ON the other Hand the Pulpits every where display'd its evil Tendency and resounded with its Infamy The Clergy were so much against it that Surgeon∣like  they dissected and cut it up without Mercy They averr'd that the House itself could not stand long that it was a second Pandemonium or Assembly of evil Spirits that though they at present triumphed yet they would shortly be de∣feated and that every one of the Members that composed it would infallibly be dd Nay one Reverend Gentleman in parti∣cular  That very popular Gentleman the candid the ingenious and ingenuous Mr RMNE  prophesied some Years after the Period I am now describing that as it was absolutely certain that the Merchants that were settling their Books at the Earth∣quake in  Lisbon  in the Year were swallow'd up and immediately consign'd to the Care of the Dl so the ROBIN∣HOOD would shortly meet the like Fate or be torn from its Foundations whirled through the Air by the Prince of it be carried like OUR LADY OF  Loretto  Thousands of Leagues and at Length with its whole Cargo thrown down to Hll  THE Society however in Spight of these Denunciations maintain'd its Ground  and increased in Fame The Names of the Members had been written in their Book of Questions and new ones were continually added The Regulations they were under were likewise copied out fair and these with the List of the Questions that succeeded them were open to every one's Perusal  THE President discharg'd his Trust with Fidelity and Honour and the Society in general thought themselves much oblig'd to him for the Care he had taken of their Interest and the good Order and Regula∣rity he preserv'd  TO make this History compleat and to perform my Promise made in the TitlePage of giving Memoirs of the most re∣markable Members I shall in this third Part as is most fit begin with the Presi∣dent  Mr CALEB JEACOCKE Or As he is more frequently called The BAKER  MY Intention in giving a few Me∣moirs of this Gentleman is not to surprise the Reader by a Relation of uncommon or interesting Events but merely to rescue a Character greatly traduced and viely misrepresented by all the Authors as far as I have seen who have employ'd their Pens on this Subject  IN the Lives of the Generality of Men there is nothing remarkable enough to satisfy the Curiosity of Readers unless the Imagination of the Author is exerted to feign Events that never happen'd and employ his Hero in Scenes he was never engaged in This is the Case with Mr JEACOCKE His Life has not been che∣quer'd with those variegated Hues that make so pleasing an Appearance in the Biographer's Page nor did he ever run  through such a Variety of Adventures as in the Recital excite alternately the diffe∣rent Passions of the Mind  HE was born in  London  and having receiv'd such an Education as enabled him only to read write and cast Accompts he was put Apprentice to a Baker He behaved extremely well in his Appren∣ticeship and was pointed out as an Exam∣ple for others in the same Station of Life As soon as his Apprenticeship was expir'd by the generous Legacy of a good old Aunt he was enabled to set up for him∣self and pitch'd upon St  Giles  's for that Purpose He was remarkably diligent in his Business punctual in his Engage∣ments and in every Respect approv'd himself a truly honest Man so that he was valued and esteemed by every one to whom he was known  HAVING a perfect Knowledge of Ac∣compts and being blessed with such a clear Judgment as could almost intuitively distinguish and separate Truth from False∣hood he was requested by many Mer∣chants and Tradesmen whose Accompts were long embarrassed and intricate to adjust and settle them And this he per∣form'd  with an Expedition and Correct∣ness that few could equal and none excel even after some of the most emi∣nent Accomptants in  London  had despaired settling them and pronounced them im∣possible to be made out clear and evident  PROVIDENCE smiled on his Underta∣kings and he got Money apace His being appointed President of the ROBIN∣HOOD SOCIETY made him universally known and THE BAKER has been talk'd of I believe in every City and Town in  England  JEACOCKE was not averse to Popularity nor in Love with it for its intrinsic Worth but for the Benefit that accompanied it in making him known to some of the greatest Men in the Kingdom and some of the most respectable and wealthy Merchants whose Accompts he settled and for which he was paid very large Sums  IN this Situation he continued increa∣sing his Wealth and Fame 'till the latter End of the Year when he thought proper to resign his Office of President of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY having con∣tinued in that honourable Station nineteen Years And in a few Months afterwards  he was appointed one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of  Middlesex  in which Capacity he now acts with an Integrity and Honour with a Clearness of Judgment and a Fervour of Humanity excell'd by none He is consi∣der'd by the Rational and Judicious as a tacit Satire on the Practice of some trading Justices who sell their  Judgment  and  Mercy  as a  Grocer  sells his Raisins and Sugar at so much  per  Pound  THOUGH JEACOCKE has never re∣ceiv'd what we term a liberal Educa∣tion yet his Mind is stored with a greater Stock of real Knowledge than nineteen Parts out of twenty of those who have breathed a College Air for many Years But though his Judgment is clear and his Knowledge extensive yet his unbounded Humanity his amiable Chearfulness his discreet Complaisance his incorruptible In∣tegrity are still superior His Philanthropy is so great that Misery and Distress never applied to him in vain His Advice and Purse were ever open to the Indigent but his Knowledge of the World teaching him to distinguish between real and pre∣tended Distress between honest Poverty and artful Villainy whenever he found  Examples of the latter he was as rigorous in inflicting Punishments as in the former he was ready to afford Relief In his De∣portment he is grave but not austere serious but not melancholy chearful but not merry reserved but not hypo∣critical He possesses Judgment without Ostentation Humility without Mean∣ness and Worth without Pride Ever open to Conviction in his Office of Presi∣dent he never obtruded his Opinions on his Auditors for certain Truths but re∣tracted them and own'd his Mistakes if pointed out  Slave  to no Sect but a Friend and Member of the Church of  England  he vindicated her from the rude Assaults of Deists and Unbelievers not by positive Dogmas and mere  Ipse Dixits  but by candid Reasoning and fair Argu∣ment When unacquainted with the Sub∣ject of Debate he sought not by retailing the Sentiments of others to pass as an in∣telligent Man or to take up their Time by delivering a String of Words without Meaning but left the Question to be debated by those whose Inclination or Si∣tuation in Life put it in their Power to speak to it properly By these Means and having a retentive Memory and a fine natural Genius and being remarkably  attentive to whatever was said on every Subject there are few he has not now a general Knowledge of and a great many he is particularly conversant in His Reasoning is close but not void of Pers∣picuity and his Elocution free and na∣tural but not rapid and verbose He ever strives rather to convince the Mind than to excite the Passions and to deliver wholsome Truths and useful Precepts than to charm the Imagination with Paradoxes and lead the Soul to Fairy Ground by the Pomp of Words and the Richness of Imagery so that his Eloquence rather resembles a smooth and gentle Current that glides softly along than the foaming and majestic  Tyber  or the rapid  Tagus  that rolls its golden Waves in Disdain of Limits overbearing and sweeping every Thing before it  JEACOCKE being such a Person as I have described it is no Wonder that he should be revered by the Society He He had a prodigious Influence over them and kept them in more Awe than a Pe∣dagogue doth his Scholars or even than the Speaker of a great Assembly can fre∣quently keep the Members as Mr AR  OSW himself once owned to Mr JEACOCKE  ANOTHER Member of the Society at its first Opening at the ROBINHOOD was the NOTORIOUS  Mr Orator HENLEY  SOME Account of this Phenomenon may not be unacceptable to the Public But as a better than I can give of him has been already given in one of the Notes to Mr POPE'S  Dunciad  I shall extract that Paragraph and then hazard a few Remarks of my own on this singular Genius  J HENLEY the Orator he preach'd on the  Sundays  upon Theological Mat∣ters and on the  Wednesdays  upon all other Sciences Each Auditor paid One Shilling He declaimed some Years against the greatest Persons and occa∣sionally did our Author that Honour WELSTED in Oratory Transactions No I publish'd by HENLEY himself gives the following Account of him  He was born at  Melton Mowbray  in  Leicestershire  From his own Parish School he went to St  John's College  in  Cambridge  He began there to be uneasy for it  shock'd  him to find he was  commanded to believe  against his own Judgment in Points of Religion Philosophy c for his Genius leading him freely to  dispute all Propositions  and  call all Points to Account  he was impatient under those Fetters of the freeborn Mind Being admitted to Priest's Orders he found the Examina∣tion very short and superficial and that it was not  necessary to conform to the Christian Religion  in order either to  Deaconship  or  Priesthood  He came to Town and after having for some Years been a Writer for Booksellers he had an Ambition to be so for Mini∣sters of State The only Reason he did not rise in the Church we are told was the Envy of others and a Disrelish entertain'd of him because  he was not qualified to be a complete Spaniel  However he offer'd the service of his Pen to two great Men of Opinions and Interests directly opposite by both of whom being rejected he set up a new Project and stiled himself the  Restorer of antient Eloquence  He thought it as lawful to take a Licence from the King and Parliament at one Place as another at  Hick's Hall  as at  Doctors Commons  to set up his Oratory in  Newport Market Butcher Row  There says his Friend he had the  Assurance  to form a Plan which no Mortal ever thought of he had Success against all Opposition chal∣leng'd his Adversaries to fair Disputa∣tions and  none would dispute  with him Writ read and studied twelve Hours a Day composed three Dissertations a Week on all Subjects undertook to teach in  one Year  what Schools and Universities teach in  five  was not terrified by Menaces Insults or Satires but still proceeded matured his bold Scheme and put the  Church  and  all that in Danger  WESLTED Narrative in Orat Transact No I  AFTER having stood some Prosecu∣tions he turn'd his Rhetoric to Buf∣foonry upon all public and private oc∣currences All this pass'd in the same Room where sometimes he broke Jests and sometimes that Bread which  he call'd the  Primitive Eucharist  This wonderful Person struck Medals which he dispers'd as Tickets to his Subscribers The Device a Star rising to the Meridian with this Motto AD SUMMA and below INVE∣NIAM VIAM AUT FACIAM This Man had a Hundred Pounds a Year given him for the secret Service of a Weekly Paper of unintelligible Non∣sense call'd the HypDoctor  POPE'S Works Vol V  THE Doctor was indeed a Composition of Inconsistency and Singularity He wanted not Sense or Learning but perverted both to the most unworthy Purposes He un∣derstood the Principles of Religion very well but his chief Delight was in making it appear ridiculous by the ludicrous Light in which he view'd it himself and repre∣sented it to others As to any fix'd Prin∣ciples with Respect to political Notions he had none but employ'd all his Talents to laugh at and make all Government appear a mere Joke But though the Doctor understood Religion tolerably well and could when he thought proper com∣pare the different Sects and exhibit their various Excellencies in a striking and pic∣turesque  Manner yet he was more dis∣posed to cull out their several Defects and Imperfections so as to make all of them appear mere human Inventions and the Creatures which interested Priests and art∣ful Knaves had dressed up to impose on and frighten the Vulgar His chief Talent lay in Buffoonery and making the most amiable Things appear mere Monsters and hideous Caricatures Thus Religion was vilified her Ministers traduced Mo∣rality laugh'd at Merit treated as a mere NonEntity and the greatest Characters in the Kingdom taken to Pieces and ana∣tomised with all the Licentiousness imagi∣nable every  Sunday  when the Ollio of Scandal and Nonsense was serv'd up to the Public He was of an overbearing Temper insolent to his Inferiors and unmannerly to his Superiors His Pride which was excessive taught him to despise every one with whom he conversed and his SelfLove which was inordinate and reign'd over him with a despotic Sway led him to suppose that every one was inferior to himself in Point of Judgment Hence that ridiculous Vanity which was visible in his every Action and prompted him to enforce his own Arguments with the most indecent Noise and violent Gesticulations  to disregard the Sentiments of others and to be continually interrupting them in the Course of their Reasoning As a Com∣panion therefore he was odious as a Clergyman indecent as an Orator re∣prehensible as a Christian culpable and as Man contemptible  THE Doctor being such a Person as I have describ'd him it may be wonder'd that his Oratory should be so prodigiously frequented But I apprehend it is no Wonder at all Novelties will always attract Scandal has Charms for many Appetites and an unrestrain'd Licentious∣ness of railing against Religion and Go∣vernment will always draw vast Numbers of Infidels and Libertines to hear their Patron and Advocate sounding the Trum∣pet of Sedition Not but that others of a different Cast attended the Oratory Some came to laugh  with  the Orator and some to laugh  at  him Some to un∣bend their Minds and forget the rigid Rules of Morality they had just before heard in our Places of public Worship and some to confirm themselves in Infide∣lity and Impiety and enable themselves to become Disputants  THE Orator with various Success still kept up his ORATORY KING GEORGE'S or CHARLES'S CHAPEL as he differently term'd it 'till the Year when he died At its first Establishment it was amazingly crowded and Money flowed in upon him apace and between whiles it languished and drooped But for some Years before its Author's Death it dwin∣dled away so much and fell into such an hectic State that the few Friends of it fear'd its Decease was very near The Doctor indeed kept it up to the last determin'd it should live as long as he did and actually exhibited many Evenings to empty Benches Finding no one at length would attend he admitted the Acquaintances of his DoorKeeper Runner MouthPiece and some others of his Followers  gratis  On the th of  October  however the Doctor died and the Oratory ceased no one having Iniquity or Impudence suf∣ficient to continue it on since which it is turn'd into a Tradesman's Warehouse  I SHALL now give a brief Account of the most considerable of the Oratorical Members from its first Establishment at the ROBINHOOD to the present Time  Mr B*RR***T*N  FORMERLY a Governor of one of our Plantations He was a Man of tolerable good Parts had been engaged in various Scenes of Life was a close Rea∣soner but very deficient in oratorical Abi∣lities his Delivery being slow and ac∣companied with a Thickness of Voice and an ungraceful Demeanor which greatly prejudiced the Audience against him He was a rank Deist and on all Occasions ridiculed the Christian System with an Asperity and Acrimony that denoted his extreme Aversion to it but it is said that on his Deathbed he owned the beau∣ty and Sanctity of that Religion which alone can ensure an happy Immortality to those who square their Lives agreeable to its holy Precepts and in pathetic Terms bewailed his own Infelicity in being depri∣ved of that Comfort and that Light which can enable the Righteous to triumph over the Grave and make Death lose its Sting  Mr B*DD**PH  A VERY  Proteus  in Principle and Con∣duct This Day of one Opinion the next of a different He changed his Sentiments much oftner than he did his Cloaths an extravagant Life and an Itch for Disputing having reduced him from an honourable Situation in Life to a very mean one with one Suit of Cloaths only to his Back He is descended from noble Ancestors has a Barone for his elder Brother but is now in the Service of the  EastIndia  Company in the Character of a private Soldier He is endued with ex∣cellent Faculties distinguishes Things with a Clearness and Precision few can excel him has a ready Wit sound Judgment and an easy Delivery but he has a squeaking disagreeable Tone and on Account of his changing Sides so often whatever he says has little or no Effect on his Auditors He has distinguished him∣self in the Republic of Letters by many in∣genious Productions but what made him more particularly remarkable as an Au∣thor was the uncommon Pains he took in the Affair of CANNING and SQUIRES  searching and diving into that mysterious Transaction and giving the Result of his Enquiries and his own Conjectures in several Pamphlets and Essays he wrote on the Subject He was promised to be am∣ply rewarded for his Trouble by the Ma∣gistrate who employ'd him in the Affair but who it is said never gave him one Penny on that Account  Mr G*NT**M*N  A VERY ingenious Gentleman the Son of a Colonel of the  Irish  Establish∣ment Author of SEJANUS a Tragedy and many other wellwrote Pieces He is now a Lieutenant on Halfpay and lives at  Worcester  As an Orator he was excel∣lent having an Energy of Expression a Facility of Utterance and a Reach of Thought few can equal Fortune who in the Distribution of her Favours proves herself a blind and ignorant Judge of Merit has been peculiarly severe to this Gentleman He was promised by a late deceased worthy Lord to be provided for but nothing has been done for him and he now lives upon a scanty Pittance a deplorable Instance that Men of the  greatest Merit Learing and Genius may sit sighing in Rags and Poverty while pli∣ant Knaves Fools and Coxcombs bask in the Sunshine of a Court and almost bend beneath the Load of Fortune's Fa∣vours He has not unfrequently wrote in Conjunction with  Mr D*RR**K  A MAN no more fit to stand in Com∣petition with G*NT**M*N than a Pigmy with  Hercules  This Gentleman however as an Author and a facetious Companion is not without some Merit His Merit however is tinctured with no small Degree of SelfConceit and his Conversation with unpardonable Egotisms He was born in  Dublin  and by his Aunt put Apprentice to a Linnendraper but instead of minding his Business he was ever reading Plays and composing Mad∣rigals In Consequence of this Propensity he ran away from his Master came to  London  and commenced Author in which honourable Vocation he continued with various Success till about two Years ago when he was chosen Master of the Ceremonies at  Bath  but was lately dis∣charged  from that Office and Monsieur CAULETT chosen in his Room  Mr FOOTE  THIS very ingenious Gentleman is so well known to the Public that any Account of him would be needless The same Thing may also be observed of  Mr MACKLIN  WHO is now exhibiting his Abilities both as an Author and an Actor at the Theatre in  SmockAlley Dublin  Mr GR***S  A PAINTER by Trade and a Deist in Principle He was a strenuous Advocate for the Society but the very Household Abilities he poss ssed put it out of his Power to be eminently s rviceable to it His Character is drawn with no unskilful Hand by the Author of THE ROBINHOOD SOCIETY  a Satire  To which I refer and shall therefore say no more of him here  JOHN H**KE  Esq  A GENTLEMAN of Genius and Judg∣ment a firm Friend and an agree∣able Companion He possesses a Solidity of Thought and a Vivacity of Imagina∣tion that seldom unite in the same Person He is descended from a respectable Family had high Expectations from a wealthy Uncle but was greatly disappointed and barbarously treated by his leaving his For∣tune from his Nephew to People he was not allied to Mr H**KE however by the Exertion of his Talents has gained a very pretty Fortune and was lately chosen Member for  M****n  in  Essex  In this Capacity there is no Doubt but he will be∣have properly for he has all the Faculties and Accomplishments requisite to form the complete Senator and in the Editor's Opinion possesses an Integrity of Soul not any ways inferior to the Judgment of his Head He is likewise a Member of the Society for the ENCOURAGEMENT of ARTS but has not for some Years be∣longed to the ROBINHOOD  Mr M*R*Y  A TAYLOR by Trade formerly a Qua∣ker now a Deist and a very  merry  Fellow he is He has no great Abilities nor very contemptible ones If an Attempt to entertain is meritorious this  merry  Fellow possesses a great Share of Merit for all his Speeches are calculated for that End  Mr WILLIAM C**TY  FORMERLY a Cabinetmaker in the  Strand  There was nothing very remarkable in this Person but that his Conceptions of Things were so dull and the Succession of his Ideas so rapid that his Tongue could not give Utterance to them He was so sensible of his Deficiency in this Respect that in the Course of his  Speechifying  he was ready to quarrel with himself for not being able to give a Vent to the Thoughts with which he was almost ready to burst Whether he was more happy in expressing his Sentiments in Wri∣ting than in extemporaneous Discourses  I know not never having seen any of his Compositions though I am told he wrote a good deal  GEORGE B**DG*S  A  Noted  BugDoctor near  HattonGarden  Author of several unintel∣ligible Pamphlets full of pious Rants enthusiastic Jargon and unmeaning Stuff He is a Quaker and has often held forth as a Preacher in which Character he must certainly appear to Advantage as he has a Facility of Utterance and can harangue for half an Hour together in such a Style and Manner it shall be im∣possible for any Mortal to fathom his Meaning Fine Accomplishments these for a Quaking Preacher  Mr S**ND**S*N  A SURGEON of some Eminence in  Great Queen Street  near  Lincoln's Inn Fields  He is of the establish'd Church with Respect to his Religion and a stre∣nuous Advocate for it As a Scholar he is by no Means contemptible as a  Surgeon skilful as an Orator middling and as an Author indifferent He is a Man of great Integrity and is respected by all who have the Pleasure of his Ac∣quaintance He is of an open chearful Temper and extremely goodnatur'd He belongs to a Society not unlike that of the ROBINHOOD held at the  Devil Ta∣vern  near  TempleBar  He is a great Admirer of the Moderns and thinks they excel the Antients in the Goodness both of their Lives and Writings How far this Opinion of his is just it is not our Business to enquire into here though such an Enquiry would be both pleasant and profitable  Mr R*B**S*N  A GENIUS truly surprizing A perfect Phenomenon He is characterised in the Satire on the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY under the Name of BIBO and indeed that Name suits him very well It is a common Saying that  Poets are born but Orators are taught  THE Meaning of this must be that without a natural Genius no Man can excel in Verse but without any Genius a Man may be capable of shining as a Speaker This however is by no Means applicable to BIBO for he was neither  born  nor  made  an Orator and it is really astonishing that without having any Thing to say he yet speaks his five Mi∣nutes at the ROBINHOOD without Inter∣mission after which he sits down and with a ghastly Grin smiling his own Ap∣plause proceeds to his darling Business of quaffing Porter  Mr B**C**Y  THIS Gentleman is Master of an Academy at  Tottenham High Cross  and has lately taken Holy Orders He is a Native of  North Britain  and is a Man of Learning and Integrity Were it not for a strong  Scotch  Accent he would be a very good Orator since his Sentiments are always orthodox and just his Diction pure and elegant his Elocution free and graceful and his Action spirited and easy I know of no Person to whom I would  entrust the Education of a Son sooner than to him for while he takes Care to improve their Heads he neglects not to mend their Hearts He was one of the Candidates for the Lectureship of  White∣chaple  Church not long since and if Piety and Virtue Learning and GoodSense had been preferr'd perhaps Mr B**C**Y had been chosen Lecturer But it is no un∣common Thing to see Merit disregarded and Ignorance exaltedInterest nowadays is the Empress of the World  Mr C**WF**D  THIS Gentleman is also of the same Country and of the same Profes∣sion as the last mention'd but not posses∣sed of equal Abilities He is however a Man of good common Sense but has no great Depth of Learning What his Merit may be as a Schoolmaster I pre∣tend not to say but as an Orator he is by no Means contemptible He is rather too diffuse in his Reasoning and his Ex∣pressions are frequently vague and undeter∣minate but there is a Vein of Piety and a Zeal for the Interests of Religion dis∣coverable in all his DiscoursesIn  short he is a Man of some Abilities but they are not so great as he imagines them to be  Mr WILLIAM W**Y  THIS Gentleman is a facetious Com∣panion and possesses a considerable Share of Learning and good Sense He was bred to the Profession of the Law but that dry Study not agreeing with his gay and volatile Disposition he frequently indulg'd himself in a Correspondence with the Muses and improv'd it to such Ad∣vantage as shortly to get them with Child as COLLEY CIBBER humorously expresses it What sort of Offspring he has ap∣pears by his SHRUBS OF PARNASSUS his BLOSSOMS OF HELICON and the POETI∣CAL CALENDAR in twelve Volumes in which last Work he was assisted by Mr FAWKES He is now Steward to a noble Lord and behaves in that Character with incorruptible Integrity and great Judg∣ment As an Orator we pretend not to give our Opinion of him as he never spoke at the Society above twice or thrice  Mr RICHARD L***S  AUTHOR of the ROBINHOOD SO∣CIETY  a Satire The Adventures of  PATRICK O'DONNELL  the Adven∣tures of  CHARLES CARELESS and a Multitude of other Works This Gentle∣man as well as his Friend Mr W**Y was bred to the Law but like him in∣stead of studying COKE UPON LYTTLE∣TON or VINER'S  Abridgment  was ever reading SHAKESPEAR and POPE and composing Madrigals As an Author we decline giving our Opinion His Works must speak for him As an Orator he must be ranked in the third Class having a weak Voice a harsh and untuneable Accent and an ungraceful Action He has not spoke in the Society for many Years and indeed if he had never spoken there at all it would have been no Matter for as during the Time he belong'd to the Society he was no Orna∣ment to it so now he has withdrawn him∣self from it he is not miss'd  Mr PETER A*N*T  THIS Gentleman has made himself very  notorious  He has been pillo∣ried fined and imprisoned several Times for his ardent Zeal in inculcating the  true Religion  and his laudable Endeavours to prove MOSES a Blhd and the Christian Religion a mere Cht in∣tended to affront the common Sense of Mankind Strange that so zealous a Reformer should be punish'd instead of being rewarded and that Mankind are still blinded by Prejudice which this Gen∣tleman would remove and still hamper'd by the Shackles of Religion which he would knock off He was formerly a Schoolmaster after that Clerk to a Mer∣chant then he had some Employment in a public Office and for these twelve Months last past he has enjoy'd a Place in  Bridewell  What he intends to do now I know not He was for some Years a main Pillar of the ROBINHOOD SO∣CIETY and used to read his Productions to the Members instead of speaking ex∣tempore As an Orator he is to the last Degree contemptible having a tame and  lifeless Pronunciation and a mean and in∣sipid Action His Abilities are however far from indifferent but it is a Pity that Age and Experience should not have taught him Discretion enoughto refrain from insulting the Religion of his Country  Mr WILLIAM R*D*R  THIS Gentleman enter'd into Holy Orders about five Years ago since which he has not frequented the ROBIN∣HOOD SOCIETY Before that he used to be a constant Member and spoke to every Question that was debated with an Extent of Knowledge and a Clearness of Precision that evinced there were few Subjects he was unacquainted with But if his Judgment is very great his Integrity is still greater He is a faithful Husband an affectionate Father a good Christian a firm Friend a chearful Companion His Exposition of the BIBLE is a stand∣ing Proof of his Piety and Learning his DICTIONARY a noble Monument of critical Accuracy and his HISTORY of  England  an undeniable Evidence of his Candor and Judgment As a Preacher he is deservedly admir'd His Composi∣tions  abstracted from the Charms of his Delivery will bear the strictest Scrutiny but when heighten'd and enforc'd by the Beauty of Pronunciation and Energy of Action it is no Wonder they should ex∣tort the Admiration and secure the Esteem of the enraptured Congregation As a Scholar he is greatly celebrated being thoroughly conversant with both the learned and modern Languages and which all his Works in general but his BIBLE and DICTIONARY in particular irrefragably prove The last contains a Fund of Knowledge beyond any other I know of and I dare pronounce it to be the best and most useful of any we have in this Dic∣tionarymaking Age  Mr R*BL*S  A JEW a Deist a Stockbroker and an Author united in one Person What an  Hachis  What a strange Mix∣tureHe wrote a Pamphlet some Time since intituled SUPERSTITION WORSE THAN ATHEISM which he had the Discretion to vend privately for Fear of the Censure of the Civil Magistrate His Notions of Religion exactly correspond  with those of Mr PETER A*N*T and his Oratory is not unlike his he has a thick mumbling lisping Voice a Hesi∣tation of Speech confused Ideas and an ungraceful Delivery It is not a little to the Honour of the Christian Religion that it has for its Enemies such contemp∣tible Beings  Mr S*****S  A VERY ingenious Gentleman a good Writer and a fine Speaker He was some Time Amanuensis to Mr JOHN∣SON and wrote many fugitive Pieces on temporary Subjects that are now for∣gotten as well as some that are now justly esteem'd  Mr RICHARD AC***D  HE kept a LotteryOffice not many Years ago after which he was De∣puty Commissary at  Belleisle  He is now a Gentleman at large and keeps Com∣pany with Bucks and Choice Spirits He is of a dry saturnine sarcastic Disposition but wants not Sense though possessed of  little scholastic Knowledge or oratorical Abilities He takes great Delight in making personal Infirmities Objects of Ridicule and of viewing the most serious Subjects with an Eye of Levity However esteem'd these Qualifications and Disposition may be by his Companions they are not re∣garded by Disputants and therefore we apprehend Mr AC***D is much better formed to shine in a modern nocturnal Meeting of Bloods than in a Society of Philosophers  Mr THOMAS M**T*M*R  THIS Gentleman was formerly a Lin∣nenDraper but meeting with Mis∣fortunes to which every Man in Trade is liable was oblig'd to compound with his Creditors after which he turned Stock∣broker being induced thereto as himself tells us by the Representations and Per∣suasions of a Set of Men who endea∣vour'd to make him believe that he might acquire a large Fortune in a short Space of Time He found himself however miserably mistaken being egregiously du∣ped by those Vultures who preyed upon his Substance 'till he had lost his All He  then set up a LotteryOffice in Conjunc∣tion with the lastmention'd Gentleman but met with no great Success However he hath since that Time repaired his For∣tune and is now his Majesty's ViceConsul for the  Austrian Netherlands  He is a Person of excellent Sense and great good Nature As an Orator indeed he never shone much a Heaviness of Aspect and a Thickness of Utterance still ac∣companying him What he said was al∣ways worth hearing but how he said it was not worthy Imitation His Piece intituled  Every Man his own Broker  discovers him to be well versed in that mysterious Business and to understand the Genius of our Language very well He is now compiling a History of  England  Mr THOMAS FL**D  THIS Gentleman is a fine Scholar an able Orator a judicious Writer and a good Christian Not long since he took on him the sacred Function and behaves with that amiable Dignity and chearful Gravity as reflects an Honour on the Cloth and shews how worthy he is to wear it Were the Number of such  Clergymen greater it would not be so common as it now is to hear Christianity ridiculed and its Ministers treated with Contempt He has not for some Years frequented the Society but formerly was very often there and was an Ornament to it The Speech which the Author of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY  a Satire  has put in the Mouth of this Gentleman whom he calls OTHO on the Excellency of the Christian Religion is so good that I can∣not refrain transcribing it  HAIL noble  Preses  Guide of Reas'ners hail  With thee my Speech begins with thee shall end  For Reason gave that Sceptre to thy Hand  And eke her sacred Laws that thou might'st still  The Voice of Infidelity and check her Friends  'Tis thine to speak the Dictates of thy Soul  'Tis thine to lend an Ear when Justice bids  Another speak and to enforce his Thoughts  Thy Smile is Truth and Error is thy Frown  Yet will I speak what right my Soul esteems  Fix'd is the Thought and rivited by Time  By Time which gives to Truth increasing Charms  And steals from Error all her borrow'd Plumes  RELIGION hail thou Guardian of our Lives  Foundress of States of Law Protectress fair  Virtue's strong Rock and Reason's noblest Guide  Without thy Aid each social Tie is lost  Without thy Aid the Laws would threat in vain  Without thy Aid this World were drown'd in Blood  Freed from the Fear of Hell or Hope of Heav'n  Life were a Load and Being were a Curse  When Misery with Hopedestroying Stake  Impales the Wretch and Horror wings the Soul  Thy Balm affords Relief allays the Pain  And bids the harmless Weapon quit the Wound  When Fortune and when Plenty load the Board  Thou on the Altar of the human Heart  Dost light a Flame that tow'ring to the Clouds  Exhales an Incense grateful to the Skies  If Foes increase thou bidd'st their Rancour end  If Dangers press Faith lends her ample Shield  Defies their Threats and frowns them into Bliss  E'en Death that plucks the Planets from the Skies  Owns thy superior Might foregoes his Sting  And the proud Grave victorious o'er our Clay  At thy Command his laurell'd Chaplet quits  Returns the Shrowd and growling leaves his Prey  SAY mighty Reas'ners Infidels baptiz'd  Who dress in Folly's Garb yet idly dream  That Wisdom's Robe upon your Shoulders shines  Say when tempestuous Passions tear the Soul  Cloud Reason's Beam and put out Wisdom's Light  Can the thin Cobweb spun by subtle Brains  Outlive the Storm and dare the Tempest's Rage  Yet when to Reason's Aid Religion joins  And in her Left Hand gives the redd'ning Bolt  Or in her Right eternal Bliss consigns  Nor Life nor Death can move the stable Soul  Nor Life nor Death impart or Hope or Fear  Unmov'd we pass as  Israel  's Patriarch erst  And make this World a Ladder to the Skies  WORSHIP whatever purblind Deists deem  Worship's the noblest Converse of the Soul  It opens Heav'n's irradiating Doors  Admits us to the Audience of the GOD  Makes him our Friend and makes us truly great  Is it an Honour for the rustic Swain  To sit in Council with the sceptred Chief  How great the Honour then to talk with him  Who is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords  RELIGION shortens Sorrow's thorny Road  Plucks from the Heart the Arrow of Despair  Matures the Seeds of Virtue in the Soul  Gives Reason Wings and bids her scale the Skies  MORE would I speak but who alas can sound  This vast Abyss or half its Stores exhaust  Yet in Obedience to thy sceptred Nod  I stop the flowing Current of my Speech  And glory in the Thoughts I have not spoke  Mr JOSEPH C*L***R  THIS Gentleman is possessed of great good Sense and many amiable Qua∣lities Fortune has not been very kind to him but has reduced him to the mortify∣ing Necessity of writing for Booksellers Were there any other MECAENAS'S to be met with it is probable that so much Me∣rit would not go unnoticed and unrewar∣ded He is not very eminent as an Ora∣tor an invincible Timidity still hanging on him and preventing a Display of those Abilities and that good Sense he is Master of One would naturally imagine that Knowledge should inspire a becoming As∣surance and a Consciousness of our being thorough Masters of a particular Subject should make us speak to it with an intre∣pid Spirit But we often see the Reverse and that Ignorance bolts forth its Dictates with a free and unconstrained Air while Learning and Wisdom are shackled by the Fetters which awkward Bashfulness puts on them Mr C*L***R has not belonged to the Society for some Years but after having attended it often enough to discern its Nature and Tendency he thought he  could neither be instructed or entertained by going to it any more  Mr S**TT  THIS Gentleman is a Physician of no small Eminence He is a Man of great Erudition a nervous Writer and a fine Speaker though in the Pronunci∣ation of many Words he deviates from the established Custom so much as has subjected him to the Censures of many Critics particularly the ingenious Authors of the  Connoisseur  and the  Gray'sInn Journal  the former by BONNEL THORN∣TON  Esq  and the latter by ARTHUR MURPHY  Esq  As a Specimen of his Oratory and Turn of Thinking we shall give a Speech he made some Years since on the following Question  How are we to be certain of the Incor∣ruptibility and Freedom of a Parlia∣ment  Sign'd ARISTARCHUS  THIS Question is undoubtedly Mr President of no small Importance though whether it can be properly de∣bated  in a Society like this I much doubt I don't insinuate by this Obser∣vation that such Gentlemen of Genius and Judgment as honour us with their Company are incapable of determining this Question and ascertaining the Marks whereby we may judge and di∣stinguish a free and incorrupt Parlia∣ment from a venal and corrupt one but am afraid very much afraid that those Marks are not so easy to be point∣ed out in any  extempore  Speech To speak to a Question of this Nature pro∣perly requires a previous Consideration of the Subject and a deliberate Thought of what we are to utter lest a hasty Judgment or crude Conjectures might mislead instead of informing a candid Searcher after Truth I shall however attempt to point out some Criterions to judge of a free and incorrupt Parlia∣ment which I apprehend may be looked on as infallible though I must necessarily omit others perhaps not less important which the Brevity of Time allowed me will not permit my men∣tioning  A FREE and incorrupt Parliament the People will ever repose the utmost Con∣fidence  in and though their Decisions may be sometimes erroneous they will never be unjust When this is the Case it will appear evidently by the following Marks  viz  WHEN the Members of Parliament act with a visible Independency and will not suffer any one Man to lead them by the Nose or browbeat them into Com∣pliance with his Schemes and thereby destroy that Equality which is essentially requisite to preserve the Liberty of these Assemblies  WHEN all the Acts and Resolutions of Parliament are manifestly calculated for the public Good and not to serve any dark and private Purposes  WHEN the Conduct of Gentlemen in Employment makes it evident that they are under no Restraint in the House but are left at full Liberty to give their Votes upon all Occasions according to their Consciences and Opi∣nions  THIS is indeed the strongest Mark of a free Parliament and we may certain∣ly  conclude it to be the Case when the Members who are in Office do not constantly run in Herds and slavishly follow a Minister in all his Proposals but when it is observed on the con∣trary that they frequently divide against what is called the Court Party and are not turned out of their Places at the End of a Session without any visible Reason but giving a Vote perhaps against some favourite Question or to make Room for others whose only Merit is a sordid pliant and prostitute Complisance  IN short Gentlemen a Parliament cannot be truly denominated free which lies under any Restraint or Discourage∣ments whatsoever nor will their Re∣solutions have any other Weight than what Force gives them for I will ven∣ture to assert that the most inconsider∣able Minority or even one honest Man of the meanest Understanding is a better Judge of political Affairs than the largest Majority which is packed together and bribed to serve the Pur∣poses of a bad Minister  BY viewing our own Parliament and having an Eye to the Marks and To∣kens I have pointed out we may be enabled to judge whether it is such a one as mentioned in the Question I hope I trust it is and that it is quite opposite to one I well remember a few Years ago when the grand Corrupter presided at the Helm Under his Ad∣ministration Bribery and Corruption were reduced to a  Susetem  ElectionJobbing was carried on as openly as any other Trade all Virtue and Mo∣rality were laughed out of Countenance the interests of Religion were disregard∣ed and its sacred Foundations under∣minded and sapped by Vice and Vena∣lity Nay the great Engine of Cor∣ruption had so despicable an Opinion of  hooman  Nature that he laid it down as an incontestible Truth that no Man could in the true Sense of the Word deserve the Appellation of Patriot  for every Man had his Price  I shall close these Remarks with a beautiful Passage from our great Poet describing the Si∣tuation of Things at this Juncture re∣marking by the Way that every Thing was subservient to the Cause of  Venality and contracted like the vari∣ous Rays of the Sun into one  Focus  to feed this dark and infamous Passion  VIRTUE may choose the high or low Degree  'Tis just alike to Virtue and to me  Dwell in a Monk or light upon a King  She's still the same belov'd contented Thing  VICE is undone if she forgets her Birth  And stoops from Angels to the Dregs of Earth  But 'tis the Fall degrades her to a Whore  Let Greatness own her and she's mean no more  Her Birth her Beauty Crowds and Courts confess  Chaste Matrons praise her and grave Bishops bless  In golden Chains the willing World she draws  And hers the Gospel is and hers the Laws  Mounts the Tribunal lifts her scarlet Head  And sees pale VIRTUE carted in her stead  Lo at the Wheels of her triumphal Car  Old  England  's Genius rough with many a Scar  Dragg'd in the Dust his Arms hang idly round  His Flag inverted trails along the Ground  Our Youth all liv'ry'd o'er with foreign Gold  Before her dance behind her crawl the Old  See thronging Millions to the Pagod run  And offer Country Parent Wife or Son  Hear her black Trumpet thro' the Land proclaim  That NOT TO BE CORRUPTED IS THE SHAME  In Soldier Churchman Patriot Man in Pow'r  'Tis Avarice all Ambition is no more  See all her Nobles begging to be Slaves  See all her Fools aspiring to be Knaves  The Wit of Cheats the Courage of a Whore  Are what ten thousand envy and adore  All all look up with reverential Awe  At Crimes that 'scape or triumph o'er the Law  While Truth Worth Wisdom daily they decry  NOTHING IS SACRED NOW BUT VIL∣LAINY  Yet shall this Verse if such a Verse remain  Shew there was one who held it in Disdain  Mr W**TE  A SCOTCH Schoolmaster that has the Brogue on him as strong as an  Highlander  just arrived from the bleak Mountains of the North He lives in  ClStreet  in the  Strand  and adver∣tises to each a just and graceful Pronunci∣ation for which he is indisputably well qualifiedwe mean of his native  Erse  but not of the  English  which he cannot himself pronounce so well as a Teague in the County of  Fipperary  He is however a Man of good Sense and possesses no small Share of Learning but as an Orator he may be compared with the  Scotch  one men∣tioned by Mr FOOTE in his last Farce and indeed it is not improbable but that in exposing the Absurdity of a Schoolmaster with a braod  Scotch  Accent teaching an  elegant and graceful Pronunciation of  Eng∣lish  the ingenious Satirist had Mr W**TE in his EyeIt has frequently been observed with surprise that in ge∣neral Schoolmasters are extremely subject to Vanity and Self conceit But I think it is no great Wonder They assume such a supercilious and haughty Air in their Schools where without Doubt it is in a great Measure necessary and contract such an Opiniatetry and Conceit of them∣selves and their own Importance as are not easily to be shaken off when they leave their native Dominions The Force of Habit is very srong and without great Difficulty cannot be conquered But surely a Schoolmaster when he leaves his School ought to leave his stiffstarched Airs and imaginary Consequence behind him and come into Company with the Ease and Deportment of a GentlemanI men∣tion these Things because the Person whose Character I am now attempting is a professed Votary to SelfConceit and imagines he is intitled to the same Respect and Homage without the Pale of his School that he has an undoubted Right to exact withinBut this as I have before obser∣ved is the Case with all of the Profession  Mr H**H*M  AUTHOR of  Genuine and authentic Memoirs of the  ROBINHOOD SO∣CIETY and an  Oration in Praise of the  LAW pronounced there a few Years ago by one PITTARD a strolling Actor He is a Person of some Sense but not half so much as he thinks he has He has not at∣tended the Society for some Years nor indeed is the Loss of him very great for as he is to be ranked in the middling Class as an Author so as an Orator he is a very mean one unfurnished with Ideas and destitute of a graceful Delivery  End of the THIRD PART  THE HISTORY OF THE  Robinhood Society  PART IV  W  E have thus brought down our History of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY from its first Esta∣blishment to the Time of the Death or Secession of several of its chief Members To render it there∣fore entirely complete we shall now give  Memoirs  and  Characters  of its principal speaking Members for the Year  THE Reader must consider that we are now arrived at a very tender and deli∣cate Part of this History Living Charac∣ters are to be exhibited and must there∣fore be drawn with so much Caution that while the Reader is enabled to distinguish to whom the Features belong the Persons themselves may have no just Cause to complain of our Severity If however in some of our Portraits the Features are homely and in others very deformed let it not be imputed to us as our Fault We create not Features or Characters but paint them as we find them  WE shall begin with  Mr P*TT  THIS Person is consider'd of so much Importance in the Society that he has frequently acted as President in which Character he has appeared in a very singu∣lar Light To draw a Comparison be∣tween J**C**KE and him might appear invidious and is certainly unnecessary since every one that has seen each of them in the Chair but once must have perceiv'd  the Difference He is by Trade a Cabinet Maker and lives in  Lg Ae  He was born at  Falmouth  in  Devonshire  and tho' he has been settled in  London  some Years he retains much of his Country Dialect Whether he scorns the ignoble Path of Imitation or whether having no Sense of what is proper and improper in the Conduct of others he is an Original without Design we are not enough ac∣quainted with his Principles of Action to determine But his Manner of opening and conducting the Debates of the Night is in all Respects different from that of every other President of every Dispu∣tingClub that we have either heard of read of or seen  HIS first Movement is a very singular  Manoeuvre  or rather  DoitO Euvre  It is a deliberate Extension of the Forefinger and Thumb of his Righthand to that Part of the Candle which is inflam'd and which he suddenly compresses between his said Forefinger and Thumb giving it a cer∣tain Pull call'd by the  Romans Vellicatio  and by this  DoitO Euvre  he severs the said inflamed Part of the Candle exactly in the Middle just as a Schoolboy severs a Halfpenny Cake for a Moiety of which  he has received a Farthing from one of his Schoolfellows or as a facetious old Gentleman divides and subdivides the Fragments of a TobaccoPipe while with circumstantial Exactness he relates some amorous Adventure of his youthful Days After the useless Excrescence of the Can∣dle is thus nicely vellicated the worthy President casts it on the Floor with a Grace similar to that which one Poet says another exhibits with his Dung and then while Mirth sits on every Face and sparkles in every Eye wiping his aforesaid Forefinger and Thumb upon his Leathern Breeches or Black Everlasting Waistcoat he cries out  "Will you be pleased Gentlemen  to order  "  THE second Part of his great Work is to open the Book of Questions and ac∣quaint the Society that the  first  Question on the Book is the  next  Question they are to speak to for their Evening's Entertain∣ment As a Specimen of his Oratory on this important Occasion we have inserted the following Speech which he made in  February    GENTLEMEN  THE  next  Question on the Book for our Evening's Debate is  a Thing  of Importance and it is this Whether a Lawyer or a  Sollier  is the  most reputablest  PersonPray Gen∣tlemen don't laugh it is worded so in the Question Whether a Lawyer or a  Sollier  Gentlemen you may laugh if you please but it is so here  pointing to the Book  Whether a Lawyer or a  Sollier  is the  most reputa∣blest  Person There is no Occasion for my explaining the Terms of the Que∣stion for  it is  easy of  themselves  The Question Gentlemen is sign'd  Bri∣tannius  Pray Gentlemen don't laughIt is against Order  Bri∣tannicus  Well that's the same Thing Is Mr  Britannius  here If he is not the Question is to go from me as if  'twere  mine Pray Gentlemen is Mr  Bri∣tannius  here GentlemenPray Gentlemen  to Order  This is against Rule Gentlemen for Gentlemen to laugh and to shew their Mirth here  Pray Gentlemen will you be pleased  to Order  Well Gentlemen as Mr  Britannius  is not here it  oft  for to go from me and the Terms of it are very easy Gentlemen You all know Gentlemen What is meant by the Question which is to know which is the  more reputabler  Profession that of the Lawyer or the  Sollier  Now as to a Lawyer Gentlemen I think the Term needs no Explanation and therefore I sha'n't trespass on your Time to tell you what it is And as to a  Sollier  it is as easy to understand as the other and therefore the Question may be  thoft  to be an Enquiry only which is the  preferabler  a Lawyer or a  Sollier  Now there is no Doubt but some Gentlemen will think the Lawyer is the  eminenter  Man and others will think the  Sollier  is so but that will appear by the Debates Now Gentlemen I must needs say that for my own Part I think a  Sollier  is the most  cruellest  Man because as why he carries Destruction and  Ruin∣ation  with his Sword when he is or∣der'd by the General But so you may say the Lawyer does likewise It's  true but then People may avoid going to Law but not to War And there∣fore I  include  the  Sollier  is the most  cruellest  and his Profession  froft  with the greatest Mischief in general A  Sollier  is possessed with  Enthusiam  I say  Enthusiam  Pray Gentle∣men don't laughI say a  Sollier  is  toft  the Dictates of  Enthusiam  and he is a  worser  Character than a Lawyer though some People may say that bad's the best The most  commonest  Thing in the World is to hear both these Characters  traducified  Pray Gentle∣men don't laugh Gentlemen pray  to Order  You are guilty of great  Irregulation  Gentlemen if you don't behave better I shall desire your Com∣pany out of the RoomWell Does any Gentlemen here choose to speak to the Question Do  you  choose to speak to it Sir Does any Gentleman on this Side of the Way choose to give us his Sentiments What Nobody speak to it Gentlemen Why Gen∣tlemen it's not a  difficulter  Question than we usually have for our  Discussa∣tion  Pray Gentlemen  to Order  I say it's not a more  difficulter  Question  than many are that are proposed for our  Discussation  Why Gentlemen you should n't laugh you know what I mean besides I am a  Falmouth  Man from  Falmouth  Gentlemen in  Devonshire  and you must not expect my  Pronunsation  to be the most  per∣fectest  for they all talk there as I do herePray Gentlemen don't laughDoes any one chuse to speak to the Question Oh a Gentleman is  up  Pray Gentlemen be silenced  WE shall next give a Character of a Gentleman very well known in the So∣ciety by the Name of  Mr S**TH  THIS Gentleman is by Trade a Dyer and in Religion a redhot  Antimonian  When he bellows forth his peculiar No∣tions his Eyes are inflamed and his whole Body seems to be the Mansion of some turbulent Spirit He is no tame Orator nor wants for Choice of Words but is so unhappy in the Application of them that he conveys a quite different Meaning  to the Minds of the Auditors from what he himself understands Let the Question be what it will he lugs in Religion by the Head and Shoulders and the most carnal Proposition is spiritualized into the most divine Meaning Thus the secret Parts of Religion are all peeped into and exposed and Discourses in the Style of the  Canticles  proposed as proper for Imi∣tation S**TH is a great Admirer of WHITFIELD and thinks him one of the greatest Men in  Europe  If Regard is extorted and Esteem rivetted by a mutual Sympathy of Minds and a similar Turn of Thinking it is no Wonder our Orator should have conceived an high Opinion of his Brother Orator And indeed their Oratory is not much unlike for Orator S**TH is as ranting as unin∣telligible and as enthusiastic as Orator WH**F***D  AS to the Abilities of this curious Gentleman they may be easily guessed at from what we have said and to dwell longer on such a Character would be to intimate he was of more Importance than he really is However we should ill dis∣charge our Duty of giving competent  Ideas of our Orators did we not draw their leading Features though we pretend not to be so particular as to paint all of them  Mr B**K*R  THIS Gentleman is a Physician and lately lived at  Trowbridge  in  Wilts  but now resides in  London  He is a Man of extensive Knowledge and strict Pro∣bity and is almost the only Orator in the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY that speaks to a Question the Imagination of the major Part of those Gentlemen being either so exalted as to carry them into the Clouds or so groveling as to put them on a Level with Coblers and Tinkers The Question itself is seldom adverted to and the End of their speaking during the six Minutes allow'd them seems to be merely to shew that they are endued with one Faculty which other Animals do not possess  Mr RICHARD M*C**L*Y  A PROFESSED Deist and an Orator without Ideas and with a very affected and vicious Pronunciation His Notions of Religion are intirely borrowed from COLLINS HOBBES and TYNDALL and his Oratory from  Billingsgate  He was formerly a Tobacconist but is now Clerk to a LinnenDraper  Mr C**D**L  A BRAZIER in Business and a Deist in Principle illiterate to the last De∣gree and as void of good Manners as of good Sense His Voice resembles a Sow∣gelder's Horn or a Crier of wild Beasts at a Country Fair Need I say more of such a worthy Member of so worthy a Society  Mr V*N*B**S  AN Attorney or an Attorney's Clerk that pours out Vollies of Nonsense as fast as a  London  Militia Platoon fire their Muskets He is a professed Advocate for all ministerial Measures and endeavours to prove by Logic and Noise that Mini∣sters like Kings can do no Wrong If his Opponents insist that if they  can  do no Wrong they must be infallible and In∣fallibility only is the Attribute of GOD he answers they are infallible and are ap∣pointed by GOD so that the divine inde∣feasible Right of Kings with all its con∣commitant Circumstances of NonResi∣stance and Passive Obedience are strongly enforced by this ingenious Quilldriver in every Political Debate If it is objected to him that the  Jure Divino  is a Doctrine that strikes at the Vitals of our present Constitution by tacitly declaring the glori∣ous Revolution to be an Usurpation and the present illustrious House of  Hanover  to be mere P**t**d**s to the Throne he will not dispute the Inference but maintain his PositionSo much for his Political Notions As to his religious ones  he is not less strenuous He thinks the Church established by Law in this King∣dom not only the best visible Church on Earth but that it is absolutely without Spot or Blemish and he would have as implicit a Regard paid to all human Ordi∣nances and Ceremonies as to the most divine Precepts and in consequence of these ve∣ry orthodox and very charitable Opinions he thinks all who dissent from the established Church  should immediately quit  England  and reside elsewhere  But to what Place they are to retire he does not inform us As to the Deists he lashes them without Mercy and pronounces it impossible for them to be useful Subjects or honest Men and therefore as they cannot be serviceable in a State they should be banished from it or broke upon the Wheel or at least be kept in Prison to hard Labour till their Minds are open to Conviction and prepared to believe the glorious Truths of the Gospel  IT is with no small Difficulty we have fathomed these Sentiments of our Man of Law who brings together such a Cloud of unmeaning Words that it requires a very penetrating Eye to see through the Obscurity That Eye we think we pos∣sess  AS an Orator he is extremely con∣temptible His Action is forced violent and unnatural and his Pronunciation which is very vicious is made more disa∣greeable by his stammering His Mind seems stored with very few Ideas and those few very wrong ones His mental Op∣tics are extremely defective and he views Things by such broken and refracted Rays as render them scarcely visible It is no Wonder therefore that he should not be able to make his Auditors fully perceive what he does not clearly behold himself In a Word his Character is well expres∣sed in Mr POPE'S Parody of a Passage in DENHAM'S  Cooper'sHill  describing the River  Thames  Flow Welsted flow like thine Inspirer Beer  Tho' stale not ripe tho' thin yet never clear  So sweetly mawkish and so smoothly dull  Heady not strong o'erflowing tho' not full  A Specimen of his Oratory is given in the following little Speech which he made on this Question  Whether the  Robinhood Society  has not a visible Tendency to improve our Morals and refine our Taste  BRITANNICUS  Mr PRESIDENT  I REALLY must be of the affirmative Side of this Question thoughawawthe Gentleman yonder in the Cut Wig hasawawdeclared himselfawawof a contrray Opinion A contrary Opinion I say Mr President Mr PresidentawawI really thinkawawthat this Societyawawthis Society I sayawawdoes tendawto refine our Mo∣rals andawawto improve our Taste To improve our Tasteawawis a noble Work andawawuseful to Society Society is benefit∣ed by it that is Mr President But awawthere is another Advantageawawour Society has and that is that we acquire Eloquence and with thatawawget Wives be∣cause weawawcharm them with the Music ofawawour Tongues and they cannotawawresist us  WE must inform the Reader that tho' the Speaker of this Speech has attended the Society several Years his Eloquence has not yet procured him a Wife We can also assure him that the Speech itself is genuine having taken it down  verbatim  in Shorthand at the Time of its Deli∣very  WE shall dwell no longer on this Gentle∣man than just to observe that he is ex∣tremely culpable in speaking out of Turn entering into personal Altercations and answering every Observation that glances on himself which greatly obstructs the Debates throws the Society into Disor∣der and only manifests the Author's Petu∣lance of Temper  Mr A M E C**KE  SOME Readers will wonder what My∣stery is couched under the Letters A M E and some will suppose that they are no more than the Initials of Mr C**KE'S Christian NamesHis Christian Name is THOMAS but since a certain Operation he perform'd on himself he  has in his numerous Writings intitled himself A M E C**KE Letters which though unintelligible to the Public are yet full of Meaning to us who have a great Intimacy with this Gentleman and they signify ADAM MOSES EMA∣NUELSo much for his adopted Name  HE was born in  Northumberland  re∣ceiv'd a liberal Education there and from thence was sent to  Oxford  In due Time he enter'd into Orders return'd to his native County and was soon after pre∣sented with a pretty good Living A Turn for Mysteries led him to a Perusal of some of our mystic Writers and he caught the same enthusiastic Flame which warm'd them A recluse and sedentary Life greatly cherish'd his Notions and it was not long before Parson C**KE was look'd on by all the Country as a second JACOB BEHMEN But he had some Notions peculiar to himself He maintain'd in his Sermons and in his private Conversation that the  Jewish  Ceremonies were not ab∣rogated by the Christian Dispensation but were still of universal Obligation In par∣ticular he insisted on the Necessity of Circumcision and supported his Doctrine by his own Practice Such novel Notions  and such extravagant Behaviour in a Pro∣testant Clergyman soon reached the Ears of the Bishop of the Diocese and he was deprived and his Living given to another Our  Jewish  Christian then came to  London  and commenced Author but his unintelli∣gible Jargon not selling he was reduced to great Distress In this Dilemma he knew not what to do but at last put in Practice another odd Notion that the Goods of Fortune ought to be shared in common by all God's Creatures  AMONG various Expedients for satisfying his Hunger formed upon this Plan one was to resort to some wellfrequented Coffeehouse and placing himself at a Table to appropriate to his own Use the first buttered Muffin and Pot of Coffee that was brought to it This he would often be permitted to do without any In∣terruption from the Gentlemen that sat near him some of whom were diverted and some astonished to see a Clergyman thus familiarly regale himself with a Break∣fast that was not provided for him As soon as it was finished however he would rise from the Table say a short Grace and very unconcernedly make towards the Door and when questioned by the  Master of the Coffeehouse about the Impropriety of using that which he did not order and the Injustice of not paying for it when he had done he would prove by Mode and Figure that the good Things of this World ought to be in common The Bucks and Bloods enjoyed the Joke and a Ring was usually formed for the two Disputants the Parson and the Coffeeman but the Coffeeman being unable to invalidate the Testimonies brought out of the  Talmud  and many learned Writings which were quoted in  Hebrew Greek  and  Latin  the Parson always came off vic∣torious  ANOTHER Practice by which this Gentleman signalized himself was StreetPreaching and having for some Time before let his Beard grow he was gene∣rally known by the Name of  The Bearded Priest  In this extravagant Manner he went on for some Time 'till some Clergymen made Interest for him to be sent to  Bedlam  where he was confined for about two or three Years As soon as he was released he took a Resolution of going to  Scotland  and actually travel∣led over that Country on Foot with not a single Farthing in his Pocket subsisting  as himself informs us in one of his Pamph∣lets by the Contributions of the well∣disposed From thence he went to  Ireland  and travelled over a great Part of that Kingdom and on his Arrival at  Dublin  in was entertained by some Gen∣tlemen in  Trinity College  who compas∣sionating the melancholy Case of a Clergy∣man in Distress gave him his Board and Lodging  gratis  After he had staid here a few Months and published some ve∣ry  original  Pieces which no one could understand but himself he return'd to  England  visited  Oxford  and then came again to  London  where he now resides but intends going to  America  as soon as his Finances will enable him  Mr ST***T  A YOUNG Surgeon that possesses much Knowledge and speaks with uncommon Propriety and Correctness He has not long frequented the Society and comes there apparently more with a View of being diverted than the Hopes of being edified  Mr W**L**GS  A JUDICIOUS humane and honest Man He is a Druggist by Pro∣fession and lives in the  Poultry  As an Orator he is neither excellent nor con∣temptible His Reasoning is close ner∣vous and always to the Point His Sen∣timents are judicious orthodox and pure and breathe the true Spirit of Christianity which inspires an unrestrained Benevolence towards the whole human and animal Species and is not angry with those who differ in speculative Opinions that little interest the moral Conduct of Mankind This Gentleman however seldom comes to the ROBINHOOD but is a constant At∣tendant at the  Queen's Arms Society  in  Newgate Street  a Society formed on much the same Plan but conducted with infi∣nitely greater Decorum He is also a President of that Society and fills the Chair with Honour  Mr W**H***LL  COMMONLY called  the goodnatured Calvinist  Why he is called so I own is to me a Mystery as his pious Fury is breathed forth with an unextin∣guishable Spirit against those who differ from him in Opinion particularly the Roman Catholics and the Deists I need not say more of him than that with Res∣pect to his Oratory and many of his Sen∣timents he is a second Edition of Mr S**TH the  Antinomian  He is an Ex∣ciseman by Profession  Mr BR**M*N  A REDhot Papist with little Judg∣ment and less Charity whose  York∣shire  Wife  perverted  him to the Roman Catholic Religion Furious persecuting and revengeful he is himself an Epitome of his Church and exhibits a true Picture of a rigid Roman Catholic By Profession he is a Schoolmaster and lives in  Little Russel Street  near  By S  but if the Pedagogue does not excel the  Orator he is contemptible to the last Degree  Mr G**D***TH  A MAN of Learning and Judgment Author of  An Inquiry into the modern State of Literature in  EUROPE and many other ingenious Works a good Orator and a candid Disputant with a clear Head and an honest Heart He comes but sel∣dom to the Society  Mr W*LK*R  A COMEDIAN belonging to the Theatre in  Covent Garden  a Man of extreme good Sense Erudition and Candor He greatly excels as an Orator having a full round and strong Voice a Facility of Utterance a graceful Pronunciation and a beautiful Action If Wit as it has been defined by a great Poet consists in a quick Conception and an easy Delivery Mr W*LK*R has a great Share of it We have been much surprised at the low Estimation this Gentleman is held in here as an Actor We have seen him perform  very capital Characters at the TheatreRoyal in  CrowStreet Dublin  with great Judgment and Execution and with uni∣versal Applause and must own we are at a Loss to what to impute his being placed on  CoventGarden  Stage in a diffe∣rent and inferior Walk  Mr WILLIAM H****S  THE Clerk of the Society who takes Care that the Disputants are duly supplied with Porter and Lemonade to refresh their Spirits and enable them to speak with Clearness and Energy He lives in  Barbican  keeps a Chandler's Shop there is a Porter also at the  India  Ware∣house is a very honest Man and is pos∣sessed of good natural Abilities  Mr B**D**GT*N  A DEIST with Respect to his  irreligious  Notions of tolerable good Sense and full of Words so that though he cannot be said to be a deep Philosopher he may be considered as a flashy ROBIN∣HOOD Orator  Mr P**E  A MAN that by his Oddity of Aspect and Peculiarity of Expression has attracted the public attention in a consi∣derable Degree for he has been frequent∣ly honoured by being made the Subject of some Essays in our daily Papers  HE was born at  Exeter  about fifty∣eight Years ago of poor but as it is said honest Parents who sent him to School where he learnt both to read and write At the Age of thirteen he was apprenticed there to a Shoemaker and during his Apprenticeship took great De∣light in reading the delectable Poems of WITHERS QUARLES HERBERT CLEVELAND and other  very great  Au∣thors and read them so frequently that he got many of them by Heart At the Expiration of his Apprenticeship he came to  London  and having received some small Pittance from his Friends set up for him∣self in the  Strand  took unto him a Wife and had four or five Children by her So far we see the bright View of his Life's History But the World soon frowned  on him and though he was continually  "supplying his KnowledgeBox with Furniture"  as himself elegantly ex∣presses it by reading the beforementioned Authors and attending constantly at Mr Orator HENLEY'S Chapel to whom he was MouthPiece running on his Errands praising his Oratory and doing him other Services yet his Stock in Trade his Houshold Goods his Customers and his Reputation were decreasing daily Altho' Poverty now not only stared our Orator in the Face but was his constant Compa∣nion yet was he indefatigable in the Im∣provement of his Mind and bore his Misery with great Patience But his  Rib  possessed not the same Fortitude She lamented her Infelicity in very pathetic Terms and Tears ran from her Eyes in copious Streams P*** beheld her Distress with the Apathy of a Stoic he answered her Complaints and Remonstrances with some Verses of QUARLES and her Tears he endeavoured to dry up with some Sen∣timents from HERBERT or CLEVELAND but all would not avail her Tongue still ran on and her Tears still flowed She wanted more substantial Food than dull Lines of Jingle and had rather see some Bread and Cheese and small Beer  on the Table for herself and Children than hear the best Arguments in the World to prove that  whatever is is right  Up∣braidings and severe Reproaches followed and the Wife insisted that the Husband was an idle Fellow who neglected his Business and the most important Con∣cerns merely to prate about Things he did not understand and to attend the Atheistical Orator whose Discourses he could never be benefitted by After living some Years in this uncomfortable State the Wife and Children left the Husband to his Fate and pursued their own The Wife took decent Lodgings sought out for Business in Washing and PlainWork and succeeded so well that she bred up her Children properly wanted for nothing and lived happily As to our Son of CRISPIN he took a paltry Lodging and went on in the same idle Manner as be∣fore getting what Work he could and putting it out to be performed In this Manner he has continued for some Years  As to the Oratory of this  Poetical Cobler  as he is usually called it is  Rudis indigestaque moles  Non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum  HIS Speeches do not consist of his own Sentiments on the Question but only of an Application of the Sentiments of those polite Authors he is most conversant with He is indeed a mere Retailer of other Men's Opinions and his Orations are like an  Harlequin  's patched Coat and yet he has Vanity enough to think himself a Man of great Knowledge and takes the Laugh of Contempt which he frequently hears at the Society for a Proof of their Approbation  HIS Speech on this Question  Whether Eloquence is of Use to Society  CICERO  exhibits a very ample and striking Speci∣men of his Oratory  Mr PRESIDENT  THAT there Gentleman on this Side of the Way seems to want a Light to be struck into his KnowledgeBox If he had opened the TrapDoors of his Mind it might have entered in But I find it has not and therefore  his Understanding wants snuffing He has really spoke like a CrabbLantern and a SnapJack so I have done with him  Howsumdever  I shall now take Notice of the other rum Gentleman who thought I was a Man of Fortune in his speaking to the last rum Question in so rum a Manner  But tho' I in this Scarlet Coat appear  I am not worth a single Groat a Year  So much for himAs to the Question Mr President I think it is no Question at all for every one that has not De∣traction in the Head and Prejudice in the Heart must own and confess  That Words alone can Harmony impart  To charm th' Attention and command the Heart  And that is Eloquence Mr President and such as must be admitted by all who do not seek the Indulgence of their vo∣racious Appetites And  Which Heads refin'd alone by Reason know  Where Sense and Judgment do together flow  Reason Mr President is King Na∣ture's  Privy Counsellor and Eloquence is to teach us  To reason down the Fever of the Blood  And sooth with Words the Tumult of the Soul  I wish the Gentleman in his own Hair yonder who is now picking his Teeth and who looks with three Eyes at me had marshalled up his Thoughts har∣monized his Understanding regulated his Ideas and informed his Judgment then he might  Blow away and speak at large  And with a holy Violence ram down the Charge  Instead of which he has taken hold of the Muzzle instead of the ButEnd of the Doctrine and hurried a halfformed Production on the Public  He has launch'd forth quite into wild Ex∣tremes  Of senseless Noise and undistinguish'd Themes  Howsumdever  Mr President I for∣give him for his  FunDawsit  on me especially as his Thoughts  is  stagnated  and an Embargo laid on his Under∣standing For  Forgiveness to the Injur'd does belong  They never pardon that have done the Wrong  Eloquence Mr President may be de∣fined to be as it were as when a Man is eloquent and to be so he ought to do as I do that is drink a good deal of Gin and avoid eating Onions A great Poet says  Immortal Gin since I have sung thy Praise  Crown me with Juniper instead of Bays  And that is Eloquence itself Mr Pre∣sident and no one will dispute it that has poised  their  Understanding and not violated the Dignity of human Nature Those who dispute it like my Wife's Relations  May the Curse of G then light on one and all  To d their Bodies but preserve their Soul  As to that Gentleman that said Elo∣quence is hurtful to Society because Poets are eloquent and in consequence  of it poor it by no Means follows  howsumdever  If Thought alone the Appetite can clay  Could Poets live Camelionlike on Air  If neither Thirst or Hunger could annoy  The poorest Poet never need despair  So that this Gentleman's Speech was a false Motion Mr President and the Question topped his Understanding  howsumdever  he chose to speak to it lest he should overgorge himself and burst at the Touchhole Another Gentleman who said as how Elo∣quence was pernicious seems to have contracted all his Senses into his Bow∣sprit to have loaded his Head with Ar∣gument and then to have primed cock∣ed and fired away  howsumdever  I excuse him because I find he is one of the crosslegged Knights of the SteelBar and a Wit But Mr POPE says  A Wit's a Feather and a Chief's a Rod  An honest Man's the noblest Work of  GOD  Eloquence Mr President is the Gift of the SUPREME and we  oft  not to despise any of his Gifts Now if I had  the Wisdom of ULYSSES the Arms of ACHILLES the Riches of CROESUS and the Wisdom of SOLOMON  I'd scower the Universe from Folly and from Vice  And make this World a second Paradise  But I fear it's impossible for me to do this though with Eloquence one might almost do any Thing even if one were attacked both in Front and Flank and knocked down in the Rear But I think that those should  Who strive to discompose th' exalted Mind  Be to eternal Banishment confin'd  And some of these there are in this So∣ciety who are for interrupting me in my Discourse very often but they had better open the Casements of their Bo∣dies to let in Light to their Minds as I do for I always  Do much desire and long to know  The Wit that from Choice Spirits flow  Mr President I see your allsilencing Hammer is lifted up to knock me  down but I shall just desire to relate a Fact which I know to be true of the public Crier at  Topsham  in  Devonshire  which I consider as a very good Piece of Eloquence He had no less than ten Children and they becoming charge∣able to the Parish he was required by the Churchwardens to get no more and used barbarously for those he had whereupon he went into the Market∣place took his Bell in his Hand rung it and then said  O YesO YesO YesThis is to give Notice  That when Breeches and Petticoats do come near  Flesh and Blood cannot forbear  This was wielding the sacred Weapon and making the Muse to flow and I think he acted right in all Respects for Mr POPE says  The Goods of Fortune variously are giv'n  A Wife is the peculiar Gift of Heav'n  He doesn't say two Mr President But I see the uplifted allsilencing Hammer again fills your Hand and threatens my Head and therefore I  must conclude But Mr President give me Leave to mention a bad Cus∣tom in this Society which is to shew Marks of their  Approbration  or  Dis∣approbration  Now Mr President I never clap the Speakers for fear of p*x**g their Understandings and yet I'll work walk or talk as much for a Shilling as any Lawyer or Parson in  England  will for a Guinea  WITH this Character we shall close our Account of the principal Speakers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY an Account that though written without Embellishment is not destitute of Fidelity and Candour Un∣influenced by any private Views we have neither indulged Resentment by wanton Censure nor for the Sake of personal At∣tachments prostituted Praise  OF the general Character of the Socie∣ty and its Influence on the Minds of young Persons little has been said And while we were lately ruminating on the Manner in which we should conclude this great Work a Friend who had perused our Manuscript came in and after knowing the Subject of our Meditations thus warmly expostulated upon it  THERE can be no Doubt in what Light the Society must appear to every Mind whose Judgment is not determi∣ned by Fancy and Passion but by the Nature and Tendency of Principles and Actions demonstrated by Facts From the History you have given of the Socie∣ty it is evident that it maintained its Usefulness and Honour no longer than while it faithfully adhered to that fun∣damental Law of its Institution by which all religious Questions were excluded from the Subjects of Debate  WHEN for the Diffusion of useful Knowledge it was thought expedient to admit every Person that chose to come and for that Purpose to assem∣ble at a PublicHouse if two or three Hours had been set apart for the Busi∣ness of the Night and no eating drink∣ing or smoaking had been permitted in that Interval and if the Subjects of Debate had been confined to the Trade and Manufactures of  Great Britain  to Natural History the Mathematics and the Liberal Arts how poorly would the Meetings of the Society have been attended Though its Credit might  have remained its Number would not have been much increased But as soon as it was known that the Drunkard and the Glutton might regale them∣selves at the Expence of the Temperate and that every illiterate Prater might display his Oratory and signalize him∣self as the Champion of Deism or Chri∣stianity the Society was immediately crowded with noisy Butchers Tinkers and Coblers with selfconceited and frontless Infidels with those not less profane though more inconsistent  Ari∣ans  and  Socinians  and with the most contentious and yet the worst Dis∣puters about Christianity  Calvinists  and  Antinomians  The first Principles of Religion and the essential Doctrines of the Gospel were called in Question every Night in the Presence of young People who unhappily deviating in their Search after Truth and Goodness were here betrayed into Error and shut up from the Sight of That by which alone Sin can be destroyed and Holiness re∣stored  THE  Book of Questions  as you have represented it is itself a sufficient Proof of the licentious and even wan∣ton  Levity with which the most sacred Doctrines and Characters have been treated In the Specimen of Religious Questions which you say you have selected from that Book there were two which I was compelled to strike out to save myself from being a Par∣taker in the Guilt of the most horrid Blasphemy And he who by his Presence has contributed to support a Society in which such Questions are suffered to be proposed registered and debated has so far contributed to the Support of Profaneness and Impiety From this Charge I exempt not even THE BAKER himself who is intitled to no higher Honour from his long Presidentship than that of keeping a rude Multitude in some external Order and preserving the Regularity of an InfidelDisputation  MANY Things indeed are called Religion that do not belong to it but that which is essential in Religion is private and personal subsisting not in disputable Notions and refined Ar∣guments but in the Sensibilities and Perceptions of the Heart For who in his Senses can dispute a Moment  whether he is a Sinner and who that feels himself a Sinner can dispute a Moment whether he should receive or reject the Pardon that is offered him and who can depend upon the Pardon of Sin any further than he feels in his Heart a Principle disapproving dis∣owning resisting and subduing the Power of Sin And yet what is more prevalent in all our  Societies for Free Debate and Inquiry  than the Folly and Madness of attempting to destroy these Sensibilities to stifle these Convictions and to prove by Logical Disputation that Man is now as he was originally made that he is therefore no Sin∣ner and that consequently he need∣eth no Redeemer But he who abandons that penitential and humbling Sense of Sin and that endearing Sense of pardoning Mercy which the Chri∣stian Redemption awakens in every Heart and endeavours to persuade himself that he can be set free from his Evil and Misery and made good and happy by Definitions or Axioms or Forms or Systems or any Thing less than the Renovation of a Divine Life abandons that for which the  whole Creation cannot yield him a Recompence  OF the Nature and Tendency of all these  Societies for free Debate and In∣quiry  the Writer of THE ADVEN∣TURER has expressed his Sentiments with just Indignation  NOTHING  says he  has offended me more than the Manner in which Sub∣jects of eternal Moment are often treat∣ed To dispute on Moral and Theological Topics is become a Fashion and it is usual with Persons of whom it is no Reproach to say they are ignorant because their Opportunities of gaining Knowledge have been few to deter∣mine with the utmost confidence upon Questions to which no human Intellect is equal In almost every Tavern and every Alehouse illiterate Petulance prates of Fitness and Virtue of Free∣dom and Fate and it is common to hear Disputes concerning everlasting Happiness and Misery the Mysteries of Religion and the Attributes of GOD intermingled with Lewdness and Blas∣phemy or at least treated with wanton Negligence and absurd Merriment  FOR Lewdness and Blasphemy it is hoped no Apology will seriously be of∣fered And it is probable that if the Question in Debate was which of the Disputants should be hanged on the Morrow it would be conducted with Decency and Gravity as a Matter of some Importance That visible good Humour and that noble Freedom of which they appear to be so fond would be thought not well to agree with their Subject nor would either of the Gen∣tlemen be much delighted if an Argu∣ment intended to demonstrate that he would within a few Hours be sus∣pended on a Gibbet should be embel∣lished with a witty Allusion to a Button and Loop or a jocular Remark that it would effectually secure him from future Accidents either by Land or Water And yet the Justice and Mercy of OMNIPOTENCE the Life and Death of the Soul are treated with Ridicule and Sport and it is contended that with Ridicule and Sport they ought always to be treated  BUT the Effect as well as the Man∣ner of those fashionable Disputes is  always ill They tend to establish what is called Natural Religion upon the Ruins of CHRISTIANITY and a Man has no sooner stiled himself a Moral Philosopher than he finds that his Duty both to GOD and Man is contracted into a very small Compass and may be practised with the greatest Facility Yet as this Effect is not always appa∣rent the Unwary are frequently delu∣ded into fatal Error and imagine they are attaining the highest Degree of Moral Excellence while they are in∣sensibly losing the Principles upon which alone Temptation can be resisted and a steady Perseverance in welldoing secured  AMONG other favourite and unsus∣pected Topics is the EXCELLENCY OF VIRTUE Virtue is said necessarily to produce its own Happiness and to be constantly and adequately its own Reward as Vice on the contrary never fails to produce Misery and in∣flict upon itself the Punishment it de∣serves Propositions of which every one is ready to affirm that they may be admitted without Scruple and be∣lieved without Danger But from hence  it is inferred that future Rewards and Punishments are not necessary either to furnish adequate Motives to the Practice of Virtue or to justify the Ways of GOD In Consequence of their being not necessary they become doubtful the DEITY is less and less the Object of Fear and Hope and as Virtue is said to be that which produces ultimate Good below whatever is sup∣posed to produce ultimate Good below is said to be Virtue Right and wrong are confounded because remote Con∣sequences cannot perfectly be known the principal Barrier by which Appe∣tite and Passion are restrained is broken down The Remonstrances of Con∣science are overborne by Sophistry and the acquired and habitual Shame of Vice is subdued by the perpetual Efforts of vigorous Resistance  THE Paper which contains this Pas∣sage seems to have been written as an Introduction to the Story of poor DICK FREEMAN related by himself under the assumed Name of OPSINOUS And as that Story is a forcible Instance of the unhappy Influence of  DisputingClubs  and may strike those whom  Persuasion will not reach I think you cannot do better than print it as a Con∣clusion to your History of the ROBIN∣HOOD SOCIETY  THUS ended my Friend whose Opi∣nion upon this Matter I have made pub∣lic as the best Reason for my taking his Advice The Story he recommends is as follows  To the  ADVENTURER  SIR  OF all the Expedients that have been found out to alleviate the Miseries of Life none is left to despair but Com∣plaint And though Complaint without Hope of Relief may be thought rather to increase than mitigate Anguish as it re∣collects every Circumstance of Distress and imbitters the Memory of past Suffer∣ings by the Anticipation of future yet like weeping it is an Indulgence of that which it is Pain to suppress and sooths with the Hope of Pity the Wretch who despairs of Comfort Of this Number is he who now addresses you Yet the Solace of Complaint and the Hope of Pity are not the only Motives that have induced  me to communicate the Series of Events by which I have been led on in an insensi∣ble Deviation from Felicity and at last plunged in irremediable Calamity I wish that others may escape Perdition and am therefore solicitous to warn them of the Path that leads to the Precipice from which I have fallen  I AM the only Child of a wealthy Farmer who as he was himself illiterate was the more zealous to make his Son a Scholar imagining that there was in the Knowledge of Greek and Latin some se∣cret Charm of perpetual Influence which as I passed through Life would smooth the Way before me establish the Happi∣ness of Success and supply new Resources to Disappointment But not being able to deny himself the Pleasure he found in having me about him instead of sending me out to a BoardingSchool he offered the Curate of the Parish ten Pounds a Year and his Board to become my Tutor  THIS Gentleman who was in Years and had lately buried his Wife accepted the Employment but refused the Salary The Work of Education he said would agreeably fill his Intervals of Leisure and  happily coincide with the Duties of his Function But he observed that his Cu∣racy which was thirty Pounds a Year and had long subsisted him when he had a Family would make him wealthy now he was a single Man and therefore he insisted to pay for his Board To this my Father with whatever Reluctance was obliged to consent At the Age of six Years I began to read my Accidence under my Precep∣tor and at fifteen had gone through the Latin and Greek Classics But the Lan∣guages were not all that I learned of this Gentleman besides other Science of less Importance he taught me the Theory of CHRISTIANITY by his Precepts and the Practice by his Example  AS his Temper was calm and steady the Influence which he had acquired over me was unlimited He was never capri∣eiously severe so that I regarded his Dis∣pleasure not as an Effect of his Infirmity but of my own Fault He discovered so much Affection in the Pleasure with which he commended and in the tender concern with which he reproved me that I loved him as a Father and his Devotion tho' rational and manly was yet so habitual and fervent that I reverenced him as a  Saint I found even my Passions con∣trouled by an Awe which his Presence impressed and by a constant Attention to his Doctrine and Life I acquired such a Sense of my Connexion with the invisi∣ble World and such a Conviction of the Consciousness of DEITY to all my Thoughts that every inordinate Wish was secretly suppressed and my Conduct regulated by the most scrupulous circum∣spection  MY Father thought he had now taken sufficient Care of my Education and therefore began to expect that I should assist in overlooking his Servants and ma∣naging his Farm in which he intended I should succeed him But my Preceptor whose principal View was not my tem∣poral Advantage told him that as a Farmer great Part of my Learning would be totally useless and that the only Way to make me serviceable to Mankind in Proportion to the Knowledge I had ac∣quired would be to send me to the Uni∣versity that at a proper Time I might take Orders But my Father besides that he was still unwilling to part with me had probably many Reasons against my entering the World in a Cassock Such  however was the Deference which he paid to my Tutor that he had almost im∣plicitly submitted to his Determination when a Relation of my Mother's who was an Attorney of great Practice in the  Temple  came to spend part of the long Vacation at our House in consequence of Invitations which had been often repeated during an Absence of many Years  MY Father thought that an Opportuni∣ty of consulting how to dispose of me with a man so well acquainted with Life was not to be lost and perhaps he secretly hoped that my Preceptor would give up his Opinion as indefensible if a Person of the Lawyer's Experience should declare against it My Cousin was accordingly made Umpire in the Debate and after he had heard the Arguments on both Sides he declared against my becoming a Farmer He said it would be an Act of Injustice to bury my Parts and Learning in the Ob∣scurity of Rural Life because if produ∣ced to the World they would probably be rewarded with Wealth and Distinction My Preceptor imagined the Question was now finally determined in his Favour and being obliged to visit one of his Pari∣shioners that was sick he gave me a Look  of Congratulation as he went out and I perceived his Cheek glow with a Flush of Triumph and his Eye sparkle with Tears of Delight  BUT he had no sooner left the Room than my Cousin gave the Conversation another Turn He told my Father that though he had opposed his making me a Farmer he was not an Advocate for my becoming a Parson for that to make a young Fellow a Parson without being able to procure him a Living was to make him a Beggar He then made some witty Reflections on the old Gentleman who was just gone out  "Nobody  he said  could question his having been put to a bad Trade who considered his Circum∣stances now he had followed it forty Years"  And after some other sprightly Sallies which though they made my Fa∣ther laugh made me tremble he clapped him upon the Shoulder  "If you have a Mind your Boy should make a Figure in Life old Gentleman  says he  put him Clerk to me My Lord Chancellor  King  was no better than the Son of a Country Shop keeper and my Master gave a Person of much greater Eminence many a Halfcrown when he was an  Attorney's Clerk in the next Chambers to mine What say you Shall I take him up with me or no"  My Father who had listened to this Proposal with great Eagerness as soon as my Cousin had done speaking cried  "A Match"  and im∣mediately gave him his Hand in Token of his Consent Thus the Bargain was struck and my Fate determined before my Tutor came back  IT was in vain that he afterwards ob∣jected to the Character of my new Ma∣ster and expressed the most dreadful Apprehensions at my becoming an Attor∣ney's Clerk and entering into the Society of Wretches who had been represented to him and perhaps not unjustly as the most Profligate upon Earth They do not in∣deed become worse than others merely as Clerks but as Persons who with more Money to spend in the Gratification of Ap∣petite are sooner than others abandoned to their own Conduct For though they are taken from under the Protection of a Parent yet being scarce considered as in a State of Servitude they are not suffici∣ently restrained by the Authority of a Master  MY Father had conceived of my Cousin as the best natured Man in the World and probably was intoxicated with the Romantic Hope of living to see me upon the Bench in  WestminsterHall  or of meet∣ing me upon the Circuit lolling in my own Coach and attended by a Crowd of the inferior Instruments of Justice He was not therefore to be moved either by Expostulation or Intreaty and I set out with my Cousin on Horseback to meet the Stage at a Town within a few Miles after having taken Leave of my Father with a Tenderness that melted us both and received from the hoary Saint his last Instructions and Benediction and at length the parting Embrace which was given with the silent Ardour of unutterable Wishes and repeated with Tears that could no lon∣ger be suppressed or concealed  WHEN we were seated in the Coach my Cousin began to make himself merry with the Regret and Discontent that he perceived in my Countenance at leaving a Cowhouse a Hogstye and two old Greypates who were contending whether I should be buried in a Farm or a College I who had never heard either my Father  or my Tutor treated with Irreverence could not conceal my Displeasure and my Resent∣ment But he still continued to rally my Country Simplicity with many Allusions which I did not then understand but which greatly delighted the rest of the Company The fourth Day brought us to our Jour∣ney's End and my Master as soon as we reached his Chambers shook me by the Hand and bid me welcome to the  Temple  HE had been some Years a Widower and his only Child a Daughter being still at a Boardingschool his Family consisted only of a Man and Maid Servant and my∣self for though he had two hired Clerks yet they lodged and boarded themselves The horrid Lewdness and Profaneness of these Fellows terrified and disgusted me nor could I believe that my Master's Pro∣perty and Interest could be safely intrusted with Men who in every Respect appear∣ed to be so destitute of Virtue and Reli∣gion I therefore thought it my Duty to apprise him of his Danger and accor∣dingly one Day when we were at Din∣ner I communicated my Suspicion and the Reason upon which it was founded The formal Solemnity with which I intro∣duced this Conversation and the Air of  importance which I gave to my Discovery threw him into a violent Fit of Laughter which struck me dumb with Confusion and Astonishment As soon as he recovered himself he told me that though his Clerks might use some Expressions that I had not been accustomed to hear yet he believed them to be very honest and that he placed more Confidence in them than he would in a formal Prig of whom he knew nothing but that he went every Morning and Evening to Prayers and said Grace before and after Meat that as to swearing they meant no Harm and as he did not doubt but that every young Fellow liked a Girl it was better they should joke about it than be hypocri∣tical and sly not that he would be thought to suspect my Integrity or to blame me for Practices which he knew to be merely Effects of the Bigotry and Superstition in which I had been educated and not the Disguises of Cunning or the Subterfuges of Guilt  I WAS greatly mortified at my Cousin's Behaviour on this Occasion and wondered from what Cause it could proceed and why he should so lightly pass over those  Vices in others from which he abstained himself for I had never heard him swear and as his Expressions were not obscene I imagined his Conversation was chaste in which however my Ignorance deceived me and it was not long before I had Reason to change my Opinion of his Character  THERE came one Morning to enquire for him at his Chambers a Lady who had something in her Manner which caught my Attention and excited my Curiosity Her Cloaths were fine but the Manner in which they were put on was rather flaunting than elegant her Address was not easy nor polite but seemed to be a strange Mixture of affected State and li∣centious Familiarity She looked in the Glass while she was speaking to me and without any Confusion adjusted her Tucker she seemed rather pleased than disconcerted at being regarded with Earnestness and being told that my Cousin was abroad she asked some trifling Questions and then making a light Curtsey took up the Side of her Hoop with a Jerk that disco∣vered at least half her Leg and hurried down Stairs  I COULD not help enquiring of the Clerks if they knew this Lady and was greatly confounded when they told me with an Air of Secrecy that she was my Cousin's Mistress whom he had kept al∣most two Years in Lodgings near  CoventGarden  At first I suspected this Infor∣mation but it was soon confirmed by so many Circumstances that I could no longer doubt of its Truth  AS my Principles were yet untainted and the Influence of my Education was still strong I regarded my Cousin's Senti∣ments as impious and detestable and his Example rather struck me with Horror than seduced me to Imitation I flattered myself with Hopes of effecting his Refor∣mation and took every Opportunity to hint the Wickedness of allowed Inconti∣nence for which I was always rallied when he was disposed to be merry and answered with the contemptuous Sneer of Selfsufficiency when he was sullen  NEAR four Years of my Clerkship were now expired and I had never yet entered the Lists as a Disputant with my Cousin For tho' I conceived myself to be much  his Superior in Moral and Theological Learning and though he often admitted me to familiar Conversation yet I still regarded the Subordination of a Servant to a Master as one of the Duties of my Station and preserved it with such exact∣ness that I never exceeded a Question or a Hint when we were alone and was always silent when he had Company tho' I frequently heard such Prositions ad∣vanced as made me wonder that no tre∣mendous Token of the Divine Displeasure immediately followed But coming one Night from the Tavern warm with Wine and as I imagined flushed with Polemic Success he insisted upon my ta∣king one Glass with him before he went to Bed and almost as soon as we were seated he gave me a formal Challenge by denying all DIVINE REVELATION and defying me to prove it  I NOW considered every Distinction as thrown down and stood forth as the Champion of Religion with that Elation of Mind which the Hero always feels at the Approach of Danger I thought my∣self secure of Victory and rejoicing that he had now compelled me to do what I had often wished he would permit I obliged  him to declare that he would dispute upon equal Terms and we began the Debate But it was not long before I was astonished to find myself confounded by a Man whom I saw half drunk and whose Learning and Abilities I despised when he was sober for as I had but very lately discovered that any of the Principles of Religion from the Immortality of the Soul to the deepest Mystery had been so much as questioned all his Objections were new I was as∣saulted where I had made no Preparation for Defence and having not been so much accustomed to Disputation as to consider that in the present Weakness of Human Intellects it is much easier to object than to answer and that in every Disquisition Difficulties are found which cannot be re∣solved I was overborne by the sudden Onset and in the Tumult of my Search after Answers to his Cavils forgot to press the positive Arguments on which Religion is established He took Advantage of my Confusion proclaimed his own Triumph and because I was depressed treated me as vanquished  As the Event which had thus mortified my Pride was perpetually revolved in my Mind the same Mistake still continued  I enquired for Solutions instead of Proofs and found myself more and more en∣tangled in the Snares of Sophistry In some other Conversations which my Cousin was now eager to begin new Difficulties were started the Labyrinth of Doubt grew more intricate and as the Question was of infinite Moment my Mind was brought into the most distressful Anxiety I ru∣minated incessantly on the Subjects of our Debate sometimes chiding myself for my Doubts and sometimes applauding the Courage and Freedom of my Enquiry  WHILE my Mind was in this State I heard by Accident that there was a Club at an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood where such Subjects were freely debated to which every Body was admitted with∣out Scruple or Formality To this Club in an evil Hour I resolved to go that I might learn how knotty Points were to be discussed and Truth distinguished from Error  ACCORDINGLY on the next ClubNight I mingled with the Multitude that was assembled in this School of Folly and Infidelity I was at first disgusted at the gross Ignorance of some and shocked at  the horrid Blasphemy of others but Cu∣riosity prevailed and my Sensibility by Degrees wore off I found that almost every Speaker had a different Opinion which some of them supported by Argu∣ments that to me who was utterly un∣acquainted with Disputation appeared to hold opposite Probabilities in exact Equi∣poise so that instead of being confirmed in any Principle I was divested of all the Perplexity of my Mind was increased and I contracted such a Habit of question∣ing whatever offered to my Imagination that I almost doubted of my own Existence  IN Proportion as I was less assured in my Principles I was less circumspect in my Conduct But such was still the Force of Education that any gross Violence offered to that which I had held sacred and every Act which I had been used to regard as incurring the Forfeiture of the DIVINE FAVOUR stung me with Re∣morse I was indeed still restrained from flagitious Immorality by the Power of Habit But this Power grew weaker and weaker and the natural Propensity to Ill gradually took Place as the Motion that is communicated to a Ball which is struck up into the Air becomes every  Moment less and less 'till at Length it recoils by its own Weight  FEAR and Hope the great Springs of Human Action had now lost their princi∣pal Objects as I doubted whether the Enjoyment of the present Moment was not all that I could secure my Power to resist Temptation diminished with my De∣pendance upon the GRACE OF GOD and Regard to the Sanction of his Law and I was first seduced by a Prostitute in my Return from a Declamation on the BEAUTY of Virtue and the Strength of the MORAL SENSE  I BEGAN now to give myself up intirely to Sensuality and the Gratification of Ap∣petite terminated my Prospects of Felicity That Peace of Mind which is the Sun∣shine of the Soul was exchanged for the Gloom of Doubt and the Storm of Pas∣sion and my Confidence in GOD and Hope of everlasting Joy for sudden Ter∣rors and vain Wishes the Loathings of Satiety and the Anguish of Disappoint∣ment  I WAS indeed impatient under this Fluctuation of Opinion and therefore I  applied to a Gentleman who was a prin∣cipal Speaker at the Club and deemed a profound Philosopher to assist the Labours of my own Mind in the Investigation of Truth and relieve me from Distraction by removing my Doubts But this Gen∣tleman instead of administring Relief la∣mented the Prejudice of Education which he said hindered me from yielding without Reserve to the Force of Truth and might perhaps always keep my mind anxious though my Judgment should be convinced But as the most effectual Remedy for this deplorable Evil he recommended to me the Works of CHUBB MORGAN and many others which I procured and read with great Eagerness and though I was not at last a sound Deist yet I perceived with some Pleasure that my Stock of Polemic Knowledge was greatly increased so that instead of being an Auditor I commenced a Speaker at the Club And though to stand up and babble to a Crowd at an Alehouse 'till Silence is commanded by the Stroke of a Hammer is as low an Ambition as can taint the human Mind yet I was much elevated by my new Di∣stinction and pleased with the Deference that was paid to my Judgment I some∣times indeed reflected that I was pro∣pagating  Opinions by which I had myself become vicious and wretched But it im∣mediately occurred that though my Con∣duct was changed it could not be proved that my Virtue was less because many Things which I avoided as vicious upon my old Principles were innocent upon my new I therefore went on in my Ca∣reer and was perpetually racking my In∣vention for new Topics and Illustrations and among other Expedients as well to advance my reputation as to quiet my Conscience and deliver me from the Torment of Remorse I thought of the following  HAVING learned that all Error is inno∣cent because it is involuntary I concluded that nothing more was necessary to quiet the Mind than to prove that all Vice was Error I therefore formed the follow∣ing Argument  "No Man becomes vi∣cious but from a Belief that Vice will confer Happiness He may indeed have been told the contrary but im∣plicit Faith is not required of reasonable Beings Therefore as every Man ought to seek Happiness every Man may law∣fully make the Experiment If he is disappointed it is plain that he did not  intend that which has happened so that every Vice is an Error and there∣fore no Vice will be punished"  I COMMUNICATED this ingenious Con∣trivance to my Friend the Philosopher who instead of detecting the Difference between Ignorance and Perverseness or stating the Limitations within which we are bound to seek our own Happiness applauded the Acuteness of my Penetra∣tion and the Force of my Reasoning I was impatient to display so novel and im∣portant a Discovery to the Club and the Attention that it drew upon me gratified my Ambition to the utmost of my Ex∣pectation I had indeed some Oppo∣nents but they were so little skilled in Argumentation and so ignorant of the Subject that it only rendered my Conquest more signal and important for the Chair∣man summed up the Arguments on both Sides with so exact and scrupulous an Impartiality that as I appeared not to have been confuted those who could not discover the Weakness of my Antagonists thought that to confute me was impossible my Sophistry was taken for Demonstration and the Number of Proselytes was incredi∣ble The Assembly consisted chiefly of  Clerks and Apprentices young Persons who had received a religious though not a liberal Education for those who were totally ignorant or wholly abandoned troubled not themselves with such Dispu∣tations as were carried on at our Club And these unhappy Boys the Impetuosity of whose Passions was restrained chiefly by Fear as Virtue had not yet become a Habit were glad to have the Shackles struck off which they were told Priestcraft had put on  BUT however I might satisfy others I was not yet satisfied myself my Torment returned and new Opiates became neces∣sary They were not indeed easily to be found but such was my good Fortune that an illiterate Mechanic afforded me a most seasonable Relief  "by discussing the important Question and demonstrating that the Soul was not nor could be immortal"  I was indeed disposed to believe without the severest Scrutiny what I now began secretly to wish for such was the State of my Mind that I was willing to give up the Hope of ever∣lasting Happiness to be delivered from the Dread of perpetual Misery and as I thought of dying as a remote Event the  Apprehension of losing my Existence with my Life did not much interrupt the Plea∣sures of the Bagnio and the Tavern  THEY were however interrupted by another Cause for I contracted a Distem∣per which alarmed and terrified me in Proportion as its Progress was swift and its Consequences were dreadful In this Distress I applied to a young Surgeon who was a Speaker at the Club and gained a genteel Subsistence by keeping it in Repair He treated my Complaint as a Trifle and to prevent any serious Re∣flections in this Interval of Pain and Soli∣tude he rallied the deplorable Length of my Countenance and exhorted me to behave like a Man  MY Pride rather than my Fear made me very solicitous to conceal this Disorder from my Cousin but he soon discovered it rather with Pleasure than Anger as it compleated his Triumph and afforded him a new Subject of Raillery and Merri∣ment By the Spiritual and Corporeal Assistance of my Surgeon I was at Length restored to my Health with the same dissolute Morals and a Resolution to pur∣sue  my pleasures with more Caution In∣stead therefore of hiring a Prostitute I now endeavoured to seduce the Virgin and corrupt the Wife  IN these Attempts my new Principles afforded me great Assistance For I found that those whom I could convert I could easily debauch and that to convert many nothing more was necessary than to advance my Principles and allege something in Defence of them by which I appeared to be convinced myself for not being able to dispute they thought that the Argument which had convinced me would if they could understand it convince them So that by yielding an implicit Assent they at once paid a Compliment to their own Judgment and smoothed the Way to the Indulgence of Appetite  WHILE I was thus gratifying every in∣ordinate Desire and passing from one De∣gree of Guilt to another my Cousin de∣termined to take his Daughter who was now in her nineteenth Year from School and as he intended to make her Mistress of his Family he quitted his Chambers and took a House  THIS young Lady I had frequently seen and always admired she was therefore no sooner come home than I endeavoured to recommend myself by a thousand Assidui∣ties and rejoiced in the many Opportuni∣ties that were afforded me to entertain her alone and perceived that she was not displeased with my Company nor insensi∣ble to my Complaisance  MY Cousin though he had seen the Effects of his Documents of Infidelity in the Corruption of my Morals yet could not forbear to sneer at Religion in the Presence of his Daughter a Practice in which I now always concurred as it faci∣litated the Execution of a Design that I had formed of rendering her subservient to my Pleasures I might indeed have married her and perhaps my Cousin secretly intended that I should But I knew Women too well to think that Marriage would confine my Wishes to a single Object and I was utterly averse to a State in which the Pleasure of Variety must be sacrificed to domestic Quiet or domestic Quiet to the Pleasure of Variety for I neither imagined that I could long in∣dulge myself in an unlawful Familiarity  with many Women before it would by some Accident be discovered to my Wife nor that she would be so very courteous or philosophical as to suffer this Indulgence without Expostulation and Clamour and besides I had no Liking to a Brood of Children whose Wants would soon be∣come importunate and whose Claim to my Industry and Frugality would be uni∣versally acknowledged though the Off∣spring of a Mistress might be abandoned to Beggary without Breach of the Law or Offence to Society  THE young Lady on the contrary as she perceived that my Addresses exceeded common Civilities did not question but that my View was to obtain her for a Wife and I could discern that she often expected such a Declaration and seemed disappoin∣ted that I had not yet proposed an Appli∣cation to her Father But imagining I suppose that these Circumstances were only delayed 'till the fittest Opportunity she did not scruple to admit all the Free∣doms that were consistent with Modesty and I drew every Day nearer to the Ac∣complishment of my Design by insensible Approaches without alarming her Fear or confirming her Hopes  I KNEW that only two Things were necessary her Passions were to be inflam'd and the Motives from which they were to be suppressed removed I was there∣fore perpetually insinuating that nothing which was natural could be ill I com∣plained of the Impositions and Restraints of Priestcraft and Superstition and as if these Hints were casual and accidental I would immediately afterwards sing a ten∣der Song repeat some seducing Verses or read a Novel  BUT henceforward let never insulted Beauty admit a second Time into her Pre∣sence the Wretch who has once attemp∣ted to ridicule Religion and substitute other Aids to human Frailty for that  "Love of GOD which is better than Life"  and that Fear  "which is the Beginning of Wisdom"  For whoever makes such an Attempt intends to betray the contrary Conduct being without Que∣stion the Interest of every one whose Inten∣tions are good because even those who profanely deny Religion to be of DIVINE Origin do yet acknowledge that it is a Political Institution well calculated to strengthen the Band of Society and to  keep out the Ravager by intrenching In∣nocence and arming Virtue To oppose these Corrupters by Argument rather than Contempt is to parley with a Murderer who may be excluded by shutting a Door  MY Cousin's Daughter used frequently to dispute with me and these Disputes always favoured the Execution of my Pro∣ject Though lest I should alarm her too much I often affected to appear half in Jest and when I ventured to take any Liberty by which the Bounds of Mo∣desty were somewhat invaded I suddenly desisted with an Air of easy Negligence and as the Attempt was not pursued and nothing farther seemed to be intended than was done it was regarded but as Wag∣gery and punished only with a Slap or a Frown Thus she became familiar with Infidelity and Indecency by Degrees  I ONCE subtily engaged her in a Debate whether the Gratification of natural Ap∣petites was in itself innocent and whether if so the Want of external Ceremony could in any Case render it criminal I insisted that Virtue and Vice were not influenced by external Ceremonies nor founded upon human Laws which were  arbitrary temporary and local And that as a young Lady's shutting herself up in a Nunnery was still evil though en∣joined by such Laws so the transmitting her Beauty to Posterity was still good though under certain Circumstances it had by such Laws been forbidden This she affected utterly to deny and I proposed that the Question should be referred to her Papa without informing him of our De∣bate and that it should be determined by his Opinion a Proposal to which she readily agreed I immediately adverted to other Subjects as if I had no Interest in the Issue of the Debate but I could per∣ceive that it sunk deeply into her Mind and that she continued more thoughtful than usual  I DID not fail however to introduce a suitable Topic of Discourse the next Time my Cousin was present and having stated the Question in general Terms he gave it in my Favour without suspecting that he was Judge in his own Cause and the next Time I was alone with his Daughter without mentioning his Deci∣sion I renewed my Familiarity I found her Resistance less resolute pursued my Advantage and compleated her Ruin  WITHIN a few Months she perceived that she was with Child a Circumstance that she communicated to me with Expres∣sions of the most piercing Distress But instead of consenting to marry her to which she had often urged me with all the little Arts of Persuasion that she could practice I made Light of the Affair chid her for being so much alarmed for so trivial an Accident and proposed a Medicine which I told her would effectually prevent the Discovery of our Intercourse by de∣stroying the Effect of it before it could appear At this Proposition she fainted and when she recovered opposed it with Terror and Regret with Tears Trem∣bling and Intreaty But I continued in∣flexible and at Length either removed or overruled her Scruples by the same Argu∣ments that had first seduced her to Guilt  THE long Vacation was now commen∣ced and my Clerkship was just expired I therefore proposed to my Cousin that we should all make a Visit to my Father hoping that the Fatigue of the Journey would favour my Purpose by increasing the Effect of the Medicine and account∣ing for an Indisposition which it might be supposed to cause  THE Plan being thus concerted and my Cousin's Concurrence being obtained it was immediately put in Execution I applied to my old Friend the Club Surgeon to whom I made no Secret of such Affairs and he immediately furnished me with Medicaments which he assured me would answer my Purpose but either by a Mi∣stake in the Preparation or in the Quan∣tity they produced a Disorder which soon after the dear injured unhappy Girl arrived at her Journey's End terminated in her Death  MY Confusion and Remorse at this Event are not to be expressed but Con∣fusion and Remorse were suddenly changed into Astonishment and Terror for she was scarce dead before I was taken into Custody upon Suspicion of Murder Her Father had deposed that just before she died she desired to speak with him in pri∣vate and that then taking his Hand and intreating his Forgiveness she told him that she was with Child by me and that I had poisoned her under Pretence of preserving her Reputation  WHETHER she made this Declaration or only confessed the Truth and her Fa∣ther to revenge the Injury had forged the rest cannot now be known but the Coroner having been summoned the Body viewed and found to have been pregnant with many Marks of a violent and un∣common Disorder a Verdict of Wilful Murder was brought in against me and I was committed to the County Gaol  AS the Judges were then upon the Circuit I was within less than a Fort∣night convicted and condemned by the Zeal of the Jury whose Passions had been so greatly inflamed by the Enormity of the Crime with which I had been charged that they were rather willing that I should suffer being innocent than that I should escape being guilty but it appearing to the Judge in the Course of the Trial that Murder was not intended he reprieved me before he left the Town  I MIGHT now have redeemed the Time and awakened to a Sense of my Folly and my Guilt might have made some Repara∣tion to Mankind for the Injury which I had  done to Society and endeavoured to re∣kindle some Spark of Hope in my own Breast by Repentance and Devotion But alas in the first Transports of my Mind upon so sudden and unexpected a Calamity the Fear of Death yielded to the Fear of Infamy and I swallowed Poison The Excess of my Desperation hindered its immediate Effect for as I took too much great Part of it was thrown up and only such a Quantity re∣mained behind as was sufficient to insure my Destruction and yet leave me Time to contemplate the Horrors of the Gulph into which I am sinking  IN this deplorable Situation I have been visited by the Surgeon who was the im∣mediate Instrument of my Misfortune and the Philosopher who directed my Stu∣dies But these are Friends who only rouze me to keener Sensibility and inflict upon me more exquisite Torment They reproach me with Folly and upbraid me with Cowardice they tell me too that the Fear of Death has made me regret the Errors of Superstition but what would I now give for those erroneous Hopes and that credulous Simplicity which though I have been taught to despise them would  sustain me in the tremendous Hour that approaches and avert from my last Agony the Horrors of Despair  I HAVE indeed a Visiter of another Kind the good old Man who first taught me to frame a Prayer and first animated me with the Hope of Heaven but he can only lament with me that this Hope will not return and that I can pray with Confidence no more He cannot by a sudden Miracle reestablish the Principles which I have subverted My Mind is all Doubt and Terror and Confusion I know nothing but that I have rendered in∣effectual the Clemency of my JUDGE that the Approach of Death is swift and inevitable and that either the Shades of Everlasting Night or the Gleams of un∣quenchable Fire are at Hand My Soul in vain shrinks backwards I grow giddy with the
