 CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE AENEID  As the reasonable De La Bruyere observes "  Qui ne sait étre un  ERASME  doit penser à étre un  EVEQUE"  POPE'S WORKS vol IV p with the Commentaries and Notes of Mr WARBURTON  LONDON ORIGINALLY PRINTED REPRINTED  a most clear elegant and decisive Work of Criticism which could not indeed derive Authority from the greatest Name but to which the  This Book is ascribed and I think with great Probability to the very learned and ingenious Author to whom the Public is indebted for the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Be the Writer who he will the Reader will say with me that the Work is    Tracts by Warburton and a Warburtonian    Page    greatest Name might with Propriety have been affixed  CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DESIGN OF THE SIXTH Book of the AENEID  THE Allegorical Interpretation which the Bishop of Glocester has given of the Sixth Book of the Aeneid seems to have been very favourably received by the Public Many writers both at home and abroad have mentioned it with approbation or at least with esteem and I have more than once heard it alledged in the conversation of scholars as an ingenious improvement on the plain and obvious sense of Virgil As such it is not undeserving of the notice of a candid critic nor can the enquiry be void of entertainment whilst Virgil is our constant theme  Whatever may be the fortune of the chace we are sure it will lead us through pleasant prospects and a fine country  That I may escape the imputation as well as the danger of misrepresenting his Lordship's Hypothesis I shall expose it in his own words  The purpose of this Discourse is to shew that Aeneas's adventure to the INFERNAL SHADES is no other than a figurative description of his INITIATION INTO THE MYSTERIES and particularly a very exact one of the SPECTACLES of the ELEUSINIAN  See Warburton's Dissertation c in the third volume of Mr Warton's Virgil I shall quote indifferently that Dissertation or the Divine Legation itself    This general notion is supported with singular ingenuity dressed up with an easy yet pompous display of Learning and delivered in a style much fitter for the Hierophant of Eleusis than for a Modern Critic who is observing a remote object through the medium of a glimmering and doubtful light  Ibant obscuri solâ sub nocte per umbram  His Lordship naturally enough pursues two different methods which unite as he apprehends in the same conclusion From general principles peculiar to himself he infers the propriety  and even necessity of such a Description of the Mysteries and from a comparison of particular circumstances he labours to prove that Virgil has actually introduced it into the Aeneid Each of these methods shall be considered separately  As the learned Prelate's Opinions branch themselves out into luxuriant Systems it is not easy to resume them in a few words I shall however attempt to give a short idea of those general principles which occupy I know not how so great a share of the  Divine Legation of Moses demonstrated  The whole System of Paganism of which the Mysteries were an essential part was instituted by the Antient Lawgivers for the support and benefit of Society The mysteries themselves were a School of Morality and Religion in which the vanity of Polytheism  At least of the vulgar polytheism by revealing that the  Dii Majorum Gentium  had been mere mortals  and the Unity of the First Cause were revealed to the Initiated Virgil who intended his immortal Poem for a Republic in action as those of Plato and  Tully were in precept could not avoid displaying this first and noblest art of Government His perfect Lawgiver must be initiated as the antient Founders of States had been before him and as Augustus himself was many ages afterwards  What a crowd of natural reflections must occur to an unblassed mind Was the civil magistrate the mover of the whole machine the sole contriver or at least the sole support of Religion Were antient laws ALWAYS designed for the benefit of the people and NEVER for the private interest of the Lawgiver Could the first fathers of rude societies instruct their newmade subjects in philosophy as well as in agriculture Did they all agree in Britain as in Egypt in Persia as in Greece to found these secret schools on the same common principle which subsisted near eighteen hundred years at Eleusis  From their institution years before the Christian aera Marm Arundel Ep till their suppression towards the end of the fourth century  in its primaeval purity Can these things be Yes replies the learned prelate they are  Egypt was the mysterious mother of Religion and Policy and the arts of Egypt were diffused with her colonies over the antient World Inachus carried the Mysteries  into Greece Zoroaster into Persia  Though I hate to be positive yet I would almost venture to affirm that Zorcaster's connection with Egypt is no where to be found except in the  D L  c c  I retire from so wide a field in which it would be easy for me to lose both myself and my adversary THE ANTIENT WORLD EIGHTEEN CENTURIES and FOUR HUNDRED AUTHORS GENUINE AND APOCRYPHAL  See a list of four hundred Authors quoted c in the  D L  from St Austin and Aristotle down to Scarron and Rabelais Amongst these authors we may observe Sanchoniatho Orpheus Zaleucus Charondas the Oracles of Prophry and the History of Jeffrey of Monmouth  The bishop has entered the lists with the tremendous Bentley who treated the laws of Zaleucus and Charondas as the forgeries of a sophist A whole section of mistakes or misrepresentations is devoted to this controversy But Bentley is no more and W  n may sleep in peace  I shall however disturb his repose by asking him on what authority he supposes that the old language of the Twelve Tables was altered for the conveniency of succeeding ages The fragments of those laws collected by Lipsius Sylburgius c bear the stamp of the most remote antiquity Lipsius himself tom i p was highly delighted with those  Antiquissima Verba  But what is much more decisive Horace L II Ep i Ver Seneca Epistol and Aulus Gellius XX rank those laws amongst the oldest remains of the Latin tongue Their obsolete language was admired by the lawyers ridiculed by the wits and pleaded by the friends of antiquity as an excuse for the frequent obscurities of that code  Had an adversary to the  Divine Legation  been guilty of this mistake I am afraid it would have been styled an  egregious blunder  would under tolerable management furnish some volumes of controversy and since I have perused the two thousand and fourteen pages of the unfinished  Legation  I have less inclination than ever to spin out volumes of laborious trifles  I shall however venture to point out a fact not very agreeable to the favourite notion that Paganism was entirely the Religion of the magistrate The Oracles were not less antient nor less venerable than the Mysteries Every difficulty religious or civil was submitted to the decision of those infallible tribunals During several ages no war could be undertaken no colony founded without the sanction of the Delphic Oracle the first and most celebrated amongst several hundred others  See Vandale de Oraculis p That valuable book contains whatever can now be known of Oracles I have borrowed his facts and could with great ease have borrowed his quotations  Here then we might expect to perceive the directing hand of the magistrate Yet when we study their history with attention instead of the Alliance between Church and State we can only discover the antient Alliance between the  Avarice of the Priest and the Credulity of the People  For my own part I am very apt to consider the Mysteries in the same light as the Oracles An intimate connection subsisted between them  The prophet Alexander whose arts are so admirably laid open by Lucian instituted his Oracle and his Mysteries as regular parts of the same plan It is here we may say with the learned Catholic  Les nouveaux Saints me font douter des Anciens  Both were preceded and accompanied with fasts sacrifices and lustrations with mystic sights and preternatural sounds But the most essential preparation for the ASPIRANT was a general confession of his past life which was exacted of him by the Priest In return for this implicit confidence the Hierophant conferred on the Initiated a sacred character and promised them a peculiar place of happiness in the Elysian fields whilst the souls of the Profane however virtuous they had been were wallowing in the mire  See Diogen Laert vi Menag ad loc  Nor did the Priests of the Mysteries neglect to recommend to the brethren a spirit of friendship and the love of virtue so pleasing even to the most corrupt minds and so requisite to render any society respectable in its own eyes Of all  these religious societies that of Eleusis was the most illustrious From being peculiar to the inhabitants of Attica it became at last common to the whole Pagan world Indeed I should suspect that it was much indebted to the genius of the Athenian writers who bestowed fame and dignity on whatever had the least connection with their country nor am I surprised that Cicero and Atticus who were both initiated should express themselves with enthusiasm when they speak of the sacred rites of their beloved Athens  But our curiosity is yet unsatisfied we would press forwards into the sanctuary and are eager to learn WHAT was the SECRET which was revealed to the Initiated and to them alone Many of the Profane possessed of leisure and ingenuity haved tried to guess what has been so religiously concealed The SECRET of each is curious and philosophical for as soon as we attempt this Enquiry the honour of the Mysteries becomes our own  I shall sum them up in a curious passage of the celebrated Freret  Les sectes philosophiques cherchoient à diviner le Dogme caché sous le voile des Ceremonies tachoient de le ramener chacune à leur doctrine Dans l'hypothése des Epicuriens adoptée de nos jours par M M Leclerc Warburton  Leclerc  adopted  it in the year Mr Warburton  invented  it in the year  tout ce qu'on révéloit aux adeptes après tant de préparatifs d'épreuves c'est que les Dieux adorés du Vulgaire avoient été des hommes c Les Stoiciens les Hylozoistes supposoient qu'on enseignoit aux Initiés qu'il n'y avoit d'autres Dieux que les élémens les parties de l'univers materiel Enfin suivant les nouveaux Platoniciens ces Symboles servoient à couvrir les dogmes d'une Théologie d'une Philosophie sublimes enseignées autrefois par les Egyptiens les Chaldéens  Mr Freret inclines though with great diffidence to the last opinion  Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions    c tom  xxi  p    Hist  I too could frame an hypothesis  as plausible perhaps and as uncertain as any of theirs did I not feel myself checked by the apprehension of discovering what never existed  Je ne suis pas si convaincu de nôtre ignorance par les choses qui sont dont la raison nous est inconnuë que par celles qui ne sont point dont nous trouvons la raison  Oeuvres de Fontenelle    tom  xi  p    I admire the discretion of the Initiated but the best security for discretion is the vanity of concealing that we have nothing to reveal  The examples of great men when they cannot serve as models may serve as warnings to us I should be very sorry to have discovered that an ATHEISTICAL HISTORY  The Fragment of Sanchoniatho's Phoenician History  Eusebius and bishop Cumberland have already observed that the formation of the world is there attributed to the blind powers of Matter without the least mention of an Intelligent Cause  was used in  the celebration of the Mysteries to prove the Unity of the First Cause and that an ANTIENT HYMN  Orpheus's Hymn to Musaeus  quoted by Justin Martyr and several other Fathers but rejected as spurious by Cudworth Intellectual System p by Leclerc Hist Eccl p and by Dr Jortin Remarks on Ecclesiastical Hist vol p The first of these the  immortal Cudworth  is often celebrated by the Bishop of Gloucester Leclerc's literary character is established and with respect to Dr Jortin I will venture to call him a learned and moderate Critic The few who may not chuse to confess that their objections are unanswerable will allow that they deserved to be answered  was sung for the edification of the devout Athenians which was most probably A MODERN FORGERY of some Jewish or Christian Impostor Had I delivered THESE TWO DISCOVERIES with an air of Confidence and Triumph I should be still more mortified  After all as I am not apt to give the name of Demonstration to what is mere conjecture his Lordship may take advantage of my Scepticism and still affirm that his favourite Mysteries were Schools of Theism instituted by the Lawgiver Yet unless Aeneas is the Lawgiver of Virgil's Republic he has no more business with the Mysteries of Athens than with the laws of Sparta We will therefore reflect a moment on the true nature and plan of the Aeneid  An Epic Fable must be important as well as interesting Great actions great virtues and  great distresses are the peculiar province of Heroic Poetry This rule seems to have been dictated by nature and experience and is very different from those chains in which Genius has been bound by artificial Criticism The importance I speak of is not indeed always dependant on the rank or names of the Personages Columbus exploring a new world with three sloops and ninety sailors is a Hero worthy of the Epic Muse yet our imagination would be much more strongly affected by the image of a virtuous Prince saved from the ruins of his country and conducting his faithful followers through unknown seas and through hostile lands Such is the Hero of the Aeneid But his peculiar situation suggested other beauties to the Poet who had an opportunity of adorning his subject with whatever was most pleasing in Grecian fable or most illustrious in Roman history Aeneas had fought under the walls of Ilium and conducted to the Banks of the Tyber a Colony from which Rome claimed her origin  The character of the Hero is expressed by one of his friends in a few words and tho' drawn by a friend does not seem to be flattered  Rex erat Aeneas nobis quo justior alter  Nec pietate fecit nec bello major armis  Aeneid i    These three virtues of JUSTICE of PIETY and of VALOR are finely supported throughout the Poem  M de Voltaire condemns the latter part of the Aeneid as far inferior in fire and spirit to the former As quoted in the  Legation  he thinks that Virgil  s'épuise avec Didon  rate  à la fin Lavinie  a pretty odd quotation for a Bishop but I most sincerely hope that neither his Lordship nor Mrs W  n are acquainted with the true meaning of the word  Rater    I shall here mention one instance of the Hero's justice which has been less noticed than its singularity seems to deserve  After Evander had entertained his Guests with a sublime simplicity he lamented that his age and want of power made him a very useless Ally However he points out auxiliaries and a cause worthy of a Hero The Etruscans tired out with the repeated tyrannies of Mezentius had driven that monarch from his throne and reduced him to implore the protection of Turnus Unsatisfied with freedom the Etruscans called loudly for revenge and in the Poet's opinion revenge was justice  Ergo omnis  furiis  surrexit Etruria  justis    Regem  ad  supplicum  praesenti Marte reposcunt  Aeneid viii    Aeneas with the approbation of Gods and men accepts the command of these brave rebels and  punishes the Tyrant with the death he so well deserved The conduct of Aeneas and the Etruscans may in point of justice seem doubtful to many the sentiments of the Poet cannot appear equivocal to any one Milton himself I mean the Milton of the Commonwealth could not have asserted with more energy the daring pretensions of the people to punish as well as to resist a Tyrant Such opinions published by a writer whom we are taught to consider as the creature of Augustus have a right to surprize us yet they are strongly expressive of the temper of the times the Republic was subverted but the minds of the Romans were still Republican  Aeneas's piety has been more generally confessed than admired St Evremond laughs at it as unsuitable to his own temper The Bishop of Gloucester defends it as agreeable to his own System of the Lawgiver's Religion The French wit was too superficial the English scholar too profound to attend to the plain narration of the Poet and the peculiar circumstances of antient Heroes WE believe from faith and reason THEY believed from the report of their senses Aeneas had seen the Grecian Divinities overturning the foundations of fated Troy He was personally acquainted with his mother Venus and with his persecutor Juno Mercury who commanded him to leave Carthage  was as present to his eyes as Dido who strove to detain him Such a knowledge of Religion founded on sense and experience must insinuate itself into every instant of our lives and determine every action All this is indeed fiction but it is fiction in which we chuse to acquiesce and which we justly consider as the charm of Poetry If we allow that Aeneas lived in an intimate commerce with superior Beings we must likewise allow his love or his fear his confidence or his gratitude towards those Beings to display themselves on every proper occasion Far from thinking Aeneas too pious I am sometimes surprized at his want of faith Forgetful of the Fates which had so often and so clearly pointed out the destined shores of Latium he deliberates whether he shall not sit down quietly in the fields of Sicily An apparition of his father is necessary to divert him from this impious and ungenerous design  A Hero's valor will not bear the rude breath of suspicion yet has the courage of Aeneas suffered from an unguarded expression of the Poet  Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra  Ingemit  Aeneid i    On every other occasion the Trojan chief is  daring without rashness and prudent without timidity In that dreadful night when Troy was delivered up to her hostile Gods he performed every duty of a Soldier a Patriot and a Son  Moriamur in media arma ruamus  Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem  Aeneid ii    Iliaci cineres flamma extrema meorum  Testor in occasu vestro nec tela nec ullas  Vitavisse vices Danaûm si fata fuissent  Ut caderem meruisse manu  Idem ii    To quote other proofs of the same nature would be to copy the six last books of the Aeneid I cannot however forbear mentioning the calm and superior intrepidity of the Hero when after the perfidy of the Rutuli and his wound he rushed again to the field and restored Victory by his presence alone  Ipse neque aversos dignatur sternere morti  Nec pede congressos aequo nec tela ferentes  Insequitur solum densa in caligine Turnum  Vestigat lustrans solum in certamina poscit  Idem xii    At length indignant that his victim has escaped him his contempt gives way to fury  Jam tandem invadit medios Marte secundo  Terribilis saevam nullo discrimine caedem  Suscitat irarumque omnes effundit habenas  Idem xii    The Heroic character of Aeneas has been understood and admired by every attentive reader But to discover the LAWGIVER in Aeneas and A SYSTEM OF POLITICS in the Aeneid required the CRITICAL TELESCOPE  Others are furnished by Criticism with a  Telescope  They see with great clearness whatever is too remote to be discovered by the rest of mankind but are totally blind to all that lies immediately before them They discover in every passage some secret meaning some remote allusion some artful allegory or some occult imitation which no other reader ever suspected But they have no perception of the cogency of arguments the contexture of narration the various colours of diction or the flowery embellishments of fancy Of all that engages the attention of others they are totally insensible while they pry into the worlds of conjecture and amuse themselves with phantoms in the clouds  Rambler  of the great W  n The naked eye of common sense cannot reach so far I revolve in my memory the harmonious sense of Virgil Virgil seems as ignorant as myself of his political character I return to the less pleasing pages of the  Legation  So far from condescending to proofs the Author of the  Legation  is even sparing of conjectures  Many political instructions may be drawn from the Aeneid  And from what book which treats of MAN and the adventures of human life may they not be drawn His Lordship's Chymistry did his Hypothesis require  it would extract a SYSTEM OF POLICY from the ARABIAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS  A System of Policy delivered in the example of a great prince must shew him in every public occurrence of life Hence Aeneas was of necessity to be found voyaging with Ulysses and fighting with Achilles  D L vol I p    There is another public occurrence at least as much in the character of a LAWGIVER as either voyaging or fighting I mean GIVING LAWS Except in a single line  Aeneid iii  Aeneas never appears in that occupation In Sicily he compliments Acestes with the honour of giving laws to the colony which he himself had founded  Interea Aeneas urbem designat aratro  Sortiturque domos hoc Ilium haec loca Trojae  Esse jubet gaudet regno Trojanus Acestes  Indicitque forum patribus dat jura vocatis  Idem v    In the solemn treaty which is to fix the fate of his posterity he disclaims any design of innovating the laws of Latium On the contrary he only demands a hospitable seat for his Gods and his Trojans and professes to leave the whole authority to king Latinus  Non ego nec Teucris Italos parere jubebo  Nec mihi regna peto paribus se legibus ambae  Invictae gentes aeterna in foedera mittant  Sacra Deosque dabo socer arma Latinus habeto  Imperium solemne socer mihi moenia Teucri  Constituent urbique dabit Lavinia nomen  Aeneid xii    But after all is not the fable of the Aeneid the establishment of an empire  Yes in one sense I grant it is Aeneas had many external difficulties to struggle with When the Latins were defeated Turnus slain and Juno appeased these difficulties were removed The Hero's labor was over the Lawgiver's commenced from that moment and as if Virgil had a design against the Bishop's System at that very moment the Aeneid ends Virgil who corrected with judgment and felt with enthusiasm thought perhaps that the sober arts of peace could never interest a reader whose mind had been so long agitated with scenes of distress and slaughter He might perhaps say like the Sylla of Montesquieu  J'aime à remporter des victoires à fonder ou détruire des états à faire des ligues à punir un usurpateur mais pour ces minces détails de governement où les Génies médiocres ont tant d'avantages cette lente exécution des loix cette discipline d'une milice tranquille mon ame ne sçauroit s'en occuper  Oeuvres de Montesquieu tom iii p    Had Virgil designed to compose a POLITICAL INSTITUTE the Example of Fenelon his elegant Imitator may give us some notion of the manner in which he would have proceeded The preceptor of the Duke of Burgundy professedly designed to educate a prince for the happiness of the people Every incident in his pleasing Romance is subservient to that great end The Goddess of Wisdom in a human shape conducts her pupil thro' a varied series of instructive adventures and every adventure is a lesson or a warning for Telemachus The pride of Sesostris the tyranny of Pygmalion the perfidy of Adrastus and the imprudence of Idomeneus are displayed in their true light The innocence of the inhabitants of Boetica the commerce of Tyre and the wise laws of Crete and Salentum instructed the prince of the various means by which a people may be made happy From the Telemachus of Fenelon I could pass with pleasure to the Cyropoedia of Xenophon But I should be led too far from my subject were I to attempt to lay open the true nature and design of that philosophical history We must return from Fenelon and Xenophon to the Bishop of Glocester  His Lordship props the legislative character of Aeneas with an additional support  Augustus who was shadowed in the person of Aeneas was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries  D L p    Ergo c  This doctrine of types and shadows though true in general has on this as well as on graver occasions produced a great abuse of reason or at least of reasoning To confine myself to Virgil I shall only say that he was too judicious to compliment the Emperor at the expence of good sense and probability Every age has its manners and the poet must suit his Hero to the Age and not the Age to his Hero It is easy to give instances of this truth Marc Antony when defeated and besieged in Alexandria challenged his competitor to decide their quarrel by a single combat This was rejected by Augustus with contempt and derision as the last effort of a desperate man  Plutarch in Vit M Anton tom i Edit Wechel  and the world applauded the prudence of Augustus who preferred the part of a General to that of a Gladiator The temper and good sense of Virgil must have made him view things in the same light yet when Virgil introduces Aeneas in similar circumstances he gives him a quite different conduct The Hero wishes to spare the innocent people provokes Turnus to a single combat and even after the perfidy and last defeat of the Rutuli is still ready to risk his person and victory against the unhappy life and desperate fortunes of his Rival The laws of Honor are different in different Ages and a behaviour  which in Augustus was decent would have covered Aeneas with infamy  We may apply this observation to the very case of the Eleusinian Mysteries Augustus was initiated into them at a time when Eleusis was become the COMMON TEMPLE OF THE UNIVERSE The Trojan Hero could not with the smallest propriety set him that example as the Trojan Hero lived in an age when those rites were confined to the natives of Greece and even of Attica  Plutarch in Vit Thesei tom i p Herodot viii Cicero de Nat Deor i The gradation of Athenians Greeks and mankind at large may be traced in these passages    I have now wandered through the scientific maze in which the Bishop of Gloucester has concealed his first and general argument It appears when resumed to amount to this irrefragable demonstration  THAT IF THE MYSTERIES WERE INSTITUTED BY LEGISLATORS which they probably were not AENEAS who was no Legislator MUST OF COURSE BE INITIATED INTO THEM BY THE POET  And here I shall mention a collateral reason assigned by his Lordship which might engage Virgil to introduce a description of the Mysteries the PRACTICE OF OTHER POETS This proof is so exceedingly brittle that I fear to handle it and shall report it faithfully in the words of our ingenious Critic  D L vol I p    Had the old Poem under the name of Orpheus been now extant it would perhaps have shewn us that no more was meant than Orpheus's Initiation and that the hint of this Sixth Book was taken from thence  As nothing now remains of that old Poem except the title it is not altogether so easy to guess what it would or would not have shewn us  But farther it was customary for the poets of the Augustan age to exercise themselves on the subject of the Mysteries as appears from Cicero who desires Atticus then at Athens and initiated to send to Chilius a poet of eminence an account of the Eleusinian Mysteries in order as it would seem to insert them into some poem he was then writing  The Eleusinian Mysteries are not mentioned in the original Passage Cicero using the obscure brevity of familiar Letters desires that Atticus would send their friend Chilius ΕΥΜΟΛΠΙΔΩΝ ΠΑΤΡΙΑ  Chilius te rogat ego ejus rogatû    Cicero ad Attic  i  which may signify twenty different things relative either to the worship of Ceres in particular or to the Athenian Institutions in general but which can hardly be applied to the Eleusinian Mysteries  As the B of G alledges the authority of Victorius I shall shelter myself under the names and reasons of Groevius and the Abbé Mongault and even transcribe the words of the former  Non est ut hic intelligantur ritus illi secretories qui tantùm Mystis noti erant sine Capitis periculo vulgari non poterant sed illa sacra ceremoniae quibus in Eleusiniis celebrandis utebantur in omnium oculis Eumolpidae quasque Poetae pris  i Scriptores alii commemorant passim aut fortè per Eumolpidas intelligit tectè ipsos Athenienses ut petierit Chilius Atheniensium leges disciplinam sibi describi mitti    Thus it appears that both the antient and modern poets afforded Virgil a pattern for this famous episode  How does this appear From an old Poem of whose contents the Critic is totally ignorant and from an obscure passage the meaning of which he has most probably mistaken  Instead of conjecturing what Virgil might or ought to do it would seem far more natural to examine what he has done The Bishop of Gloucester attempts to prove that the Descent to Hell is properly an Initiation since the Sixth Book of the Aeneid really contains the secret Doctrine as well as the Ceremonies of the Eleusinian Mysteries  What was this SECRET DOCTRINE As I profess my ignorance we must consult the Oracle  The secret Doctrine of the Mysteries revealed to the Initiated that JUPITER AND THE WHOLE RABBLE OF LICENTIOUS DEITIES  WERE ONLY DEAD MORTALS  D L vol I p    Is any thing like this laid open in the Sixth Book of Virgil Not the remotest hint of it can be discovered throughout the whole Book and thus to use his Lordship's own words SOMETHING I had almost written EVERY THING is still wanting "to complete the IDENTIFICATION  Idem p    Notwithstanding this disappointment which is cautiously concealed from the reader the learned Bishop still courses round the Elysian Fields in quest of a Secret Once he is so lucky as to find Aeneas talking with the Poet Musaeus whom tradition has reckoned among the founders of the Eleusinian Mysteries The Critic listens to their conversation but alas Aeneas is only enquiring in what part of the garden he may find his Father's shade to which Musaeus returns a very polite answer Anchises himself is our last hope As that venerable shade explains to his son some mysterious doctrines concerning the Universal Mind and the Transmigration of Souls his Lordship is pleased to assure us that these are THE HIDDEN DOCTRINES OF PERFECTION revealed only to the Initiated Let us for a moment lay aside Hypothesis and read Virgil  It is observable that the three great Poets of Rome were all addicted to the Epicurean philosophy a System however the least suited to a Poet since it banishes all the genial and active  Powers of Nature to substitute in their room a dreary void blind atoms and indolent Gods A Description of the Infernal Shades was incompatible with the ideas of a Philosopher whose disciples boasted that he had rescued the captive World from the Tyranny of Religion and the Fear of a Future State These ideas Virgil was obliged to reject But he does still more he abandons not only the CHANCE of Epicurus but even these Gods whom he so nobly employs in the rest of his Poem that he may offer to the Reader's imagination a far more specious and splendid sett of Ideas  Principio coelum ac terras camposque liquentes  Lucentemque globum Lunae Titaniaque astra  Spiritus intus alit totamque infusa per artus  Mens agitat molem magno se corpore miscet  Aeneid vi    The more we examine these lines the more we shall feel the sublime Poetry of them But they have likewise an air of Philosophy and even of Religion which goes off on a nearer approach The mind which is INFUSED  Quomodo porro Deus iste si nihil esset nisi animus aut infixus aut  infusus  esset in mundo  Cicero de Naturâ Deor  l i c  into the several parts of Matter and which MINGLES ITSELF with the mighty mass scarce retains any Property of a Spiritual Substance and bears too near an  affinity to the Principles which the impious Spinoza revived rather than invented  I am not insensible that we should be slow to suspect and still slower to condemn The poverty of human language and the obscurity of human ideas makes it difficult to speak worthily of THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE Our most religious Poets in striving to express the presence and energy of the Deity in every part of the Universe deviate unwarily into images which are scarcely distinguished from Materialism Thus our Ethic Poet  All are but parts of one stupendous Whole  Whose body Nature is and God the soul  Pope's Essay on Man Epistle I ver    and several passages of Thomson require a like favourable construction But these writers deserve that favour by the sublime manner in which they celebrate the great Father of the Universe and by those effusions of love and gratitude which are inconsistent with the Materialist's System Virgil has no such claim to our indulgence THE MIND of the UNIVERSE is rather a Metaphysical than a Theological Being His intellectual qualities are faintly distinguished from the Powers of Matter and his moral Attributes the source of all religious worship form no part of Virgil's creed  Yet is this creed approved  D L vol I p  by our Orthodox Prelate as free from any mixture of Spinozism I congratulate his Lordship on his indulgent and moderate temper His Brethren I mean those of former times had much sharper eyes for spying out a latent Heresy Yet I cannot easily persuade myself that Virgil's notions were ever the creed of a religious Society like that of the Mysteries Luckily indeed I have no occasion to persuade myself of it unless I should prefer his Lordship's mere authority to the voice of Antiquity which assures me that this System was either invented or imported into Greece by Pythagoras from the writings of whose disciples Virgil might so very naturally borrow it  Anchises then proceeds to inform his son that the souls both of men and of animals were of celestial origin and as I understand him parts of the Universal Mind but that by their union with earthly bodies they contracted such impurities as even Death could not purge away Many expiations continues the venerable shade are requisite before the soul restored to its original Simplicity is capable of a place in Elysium The far greater part are obliged to revisit the upper world in other characters and in other bodies and thus by gradual steps to reascend towards their first perfection  This moral Transmigration was undoubtedly taught in the Mysteries As the Bishop asserts this from the best authority we are surprized at a sort of diffidence unusual to his Lordship when he advances things from his own intuitive knowledge In one place this Transmigration is part of the hidden Doctrine of Perfection  D L vol I p  in another it is one of those principles which were promiscuously communicated to all  Idem p  The truth seems to be that his Lordship was afraid to rank among the secrets of the Mysteries what was professed and believed by so many Nations and Philosophers The preexistence of the human soul is a very natural idea and from that idea speculations and fables of its successive revolution through various bodies will arise From Japan to Egypt the Transmigration has been part of the popular and religious creed  See our modern Relations of Japan China India c and for Egypt Herodotus l ii  Pythagoras  Ovid Metamorph xv c c  and Plato  Plato in Phaedro in Republic l x  have endeavoured to demonstrate the truth of it by facts as well as by arguments  Of all these visions which should have been confined to the Poets none is more pleasing and sublime than that which Virgil has invented Aeneas sees before him his posterity the Heroes of antient Rome a long series of airy forms  Demanding life impatient for the skies  and prepared to assume with their new bodies the little passions and transient glories of their destined lives  Having  I shall mention here once for all that I do not always confine myself to the ORDER of his Lordship's PROOFS  thus revealed the secret Doctrine of the Mysteries the learned Prelate examines the Ceremonies With the assistance of Meursius  Meursii Eleusinia five de Cereris Eleusinae sacro  he pours out a torrent of Erudition to convince us that the scenes thro' which Aeneas passed in his descent to the Shades were the same as were represented to the Aspirants in the Celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries From thence his Lordship draws his great conclusion That the Descent is no more than an emblem of the Hero's Initiation  A staunch Polemic will feed a dispute by dwelling on every accessary circumstance whilst a candid Critic will confine himself to the more essential points of it I shall therefore readily allow what I believe may in general be true that the Mysteries exhibited a theatrical representation of all that was believed or imagined of the lower world that the Aspirant was conducted through the mimic scenes of Erebus Tartarus and Elysium and that a warm Enthusiast in describing these awful Spectacles might express himself as if he had actually visited the  infernal Regions  See D L vol I particularly p  All this I can allow and yet allow nothing to the Bishop of Gloucester's Hypothesis It is not surprising that the COPY was like the ORIGINAL but it still remains undetermined WHETHER VIRGIL INTENDED TO DESCRIBE THE ORIGINAL OR THE COPY  Lear and Garrick when on the stage are the same nor is it possible to distinguish the Player from the Monarch In the Greenroom or after the representation we easily perceive what the warmth of fancy and the justness of imitation had concealed from us In the same manner it is from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of Virgil's Allegory Every one of those circumstances persuades me that Virgil described a real not a mimic world and that the Scene lay in the Infernal Shades and not in the Temple of Ceres  The singularity of the Cumoean Shores must be present to every traveller who has once seen them To a superstitious mind the thin crust vast cavities sulphureous steams poisonous exhalations and fiery torrents may seem to trace out the narrow Confine of the two Worlds The lake Avernus was the chief object of religious horror the black Woods which surrounded it when Virgil first came to Naples were perfectly suited to feed the superstition of the People  Strabo l v p  It was generally believed that this  deadly flood was the entrance of Hell  Silius Italicus l xii  and an Oracle was once established on its banks which pretended by magic rites to call up the departed Spirits  Diod Sicul l iv p edit Wesseling  Aeneas who revolved a more daring enterprise addresses himself to the Priestess of those dark Regions Their conversation may perhaps inform us whether an Initiation or a descent to the Shades was the object of this enterprize She endeavours to deter the Hero by setting before him all the dangers of his rash undertaking  Facilis descensus Averni  Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis  Sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras  Hoc opus hic labor est  Aeneid vi    These particulars are absolutely irreconcileable with the idea of Initiation but perfectly agreeable to that of a real descent That every step and every instant may lead us to the grave is a melancholy truth The Mysteries were only open at stated times a few days at most in the course of a year The mimic descent of the Mysteries was laborious and dangerous the return to light easy and certain In real death this order is inverted  Pauci quos aequus amavit  Jupiter aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus  Diis geniti potuere  Idem vi    These Heroes as we learn from the speech of Aeneas were Hercules Orpheus Castor and Pollux Theseus and Pirithous Of all these Antiquity believed that before their death they had seen the habitations of the dead nor indeed will any of the circumstances tally with a supposed Initiation The adventure of Eurydice the alternate life of the brothers and the forcible intrusion of Alcides Theseus and Pirithous would mock the endeavours of the most subtle Critic who should try to melt them down into his favourite Mysteries The exploits of Hercules who triumphed over the King of Terrors  Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit  Ipsius à solio regis traxitque trementem  Aeneid vi    was a wild imagination of the Greeks  Homer Odyss l xi ver Apoll Biblioth l ii c  But it was the duty of antient Poets to adopt and embellish these popular Traditions and it is the interest of every man of taste to acquiesce in THEIR POETICAL FICTIONS  After this we may leave ingenious men to search out what or whether any thing gave rise to those idle stories Diodorus Siculus represents Pluto as a kind of undertaker who made great improvements in the useful art of funerals  Diodor Sicul l v p Edit Wesseling  Some have sought for the Poetic Hell in the mines of Epirus  Leclerc Biblioth Universelle tom vi p  and others in the Mysteries  of Egypt As this last notion was published in French  By the Abbé Terasson in his Philosophical Romance of Sethos printed at Amsterdam in the year See the Third Book from beginning to end The author was a Scholar and a Philosopher His book has far more variety and originality than Telemachus Yet Sethos is forgotten and Telemachus will be immortal That harmony of style and the great talent of speaking to the heart and passions which Fenelon possessed was unknown to Terasson I am not surprized that Homer was admired by the one and criticized by the other  six years before it was invented in English  See D L vol I p c The first edition was printed in London in the year  the learned author of the  D L  has been severely treated by some ungenerous Adversaries  Cowper's Life of Socrates p  Appearances it must be confessed wear a very suspicious aspect But what are appearances when weighed against his Lordship's declaration  That this is a point of honor in which he is particularly delicate and that he may venture to boast that he believes no Author was ever more averse to take to himself what belonged to another  Letter from a late Professor of Oxford c p    Besides he has enriched this mysterious discovery with many collateral arguments which would for ever have escaped all inferior Critics In the case of Hercules for instance he demonstrates that the Initiation and the descent to the Shades were the same thing because an Antient has  affirmed that they were different  D L vol III p  and that Alcides was initiated at Eleusis before he set out for Taenarus in order to descend to the Infernal Regions  There is however a single circumstance in the narration of Virgil which has justly surprized Critics unacquainted with any but the obvious sense of the Poet I mean the IVORY GATE The Bishop of Glocester seizes this as the secret mark of Allegory and becomes eloquent in the exultation of Triumph  Idem vol I p  I could however represent to him that in a work which was deprived of the Author's last revision Virgil might too hastily employ what Homer had invented and at last unwarily slide into an Epicurean idea  Idem vol I p  Let this be as it may an obscure expression is a weak basis for an elaborate System and whatever his Lordship may chuse to do I had much rather reproach my favourite Poet with want of care in one line than with want of taste throughout a whole Book  Horace seems to have used as unguarded an expression▪  Et adscribi  quietis  Ordinibus patiar Deorum  Od l iii  The word and idea of  Quietis  are perfectly Epicurean but rather clash with the active passions displayed in the rest of Juno's speech  His Lordship D L vol II p accuses Virgil himself of a like inattention which with his usual gentleness he calls an  absurdity    Virgil has borrowed as usual from Homer his Episode of the Infernal Shades and as usual has infinitely improved what the Grecian had invented If among a profusion of beauties I durst venture to point out the most striking beauties of the Sixth Book I should perhaps observe That after accompanying the Hero through the silent realms of Night and Chaos we see with astonishment and pleasure a new Creation bursting upon us That we examine with a delight which springs from the love of Virtue the just empire of Minos in which the apparent irregularities of the present System are corrected where the Patriot who died for his Country is happy and the Tyrant who oppressed it is miserable As we interest ourselves in the Hero's fortunes we share his feelings The melancholy Palinurus the wretched Deiphobus the indignant Dido the Grecian Kings who tremble at his presence and the venerable Anchises who embraces his pious son and displays to his sight the future glories of his race all these objects affects us with a variety of pleasing sensations  Let us for a moment obey the mandate of our great Critic and consider these awful scenes as a mimic shew exhibited in the Temple of Ceres by the contrivance of the Priest or if he pleases of the Legislator Whatever was animated I appeal to every reader of taste whatever  ever was terrible or whatever was pathetic evaporates into lifeless Allegory  tenuem sine viribus umbram  Dat inania verba  Dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis  The end of Philosophy is Truth the end of Poetry is Pleasure I willingly adopt any interpretation which adds new beauties to the Original I assist in persuading myself that it is just and could almost shew the same indulgence to the Critic's as to the Poet's fiction But should a grave Doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of Virgil I should have every inducement to believe that Virgil's soul was very different from the Doctor's  I have almost exhausted my own and probably my reader's patience whilst I have obsequiously waited on his Lordship through the several stages of an intricate Hypothesis He must now permit me to alledge two very simple reasons which persuade me that Virgil has not revealed the Secret of the Eleusinian Mysteries the first is HIS IGNORANCE and the second HIS DISCRETION  I As his Lordship has not made the smallest attempt to prove that Virgil was himself initiated  it is plain that he supposed it as a thing of course Had he any right to suppose it By no means That ceremony might naturally enough finish the education of a young Athenian but a Barbarian a Roman would most probably pass through life without directing his devotion to the foreign rites of Eleusis  The Philosophical sentiments of Virgil were still more unlikely to inspire him with that kind of devotion It is well known that he was a determined Epicurean  See the Life of Virgil by Donatus the Sixth Eclogue and the Second Georgic ver  and a very natural Antipathy subsisted between the Epicureans and the Managers of the Mysteries The Celebration opened with a solemn excommunication of those Atheistical Philosophers who were commanded to retire and to leave that holy place for pious Believers  Lucian in Alexandro p  the zeal of the people was ready to enforce this admonition I will not deny that curiosity might sometimes tempt an Epicurean to pry into these secret rites and that gratitude fear or other motives might engage the Athenians to admit so irreligious an Aspirant Atticus was initiated at Eleusis but Atticus was the Friend and Benefactor of Athens  Cornel Nepos in Vit Attici c  These extraordinary exceptions may be proved but must not be supposed  Nay more I am strongly inclined to think that Virgil was never out of Italy till the last year of his life I am sensible that it is not easy to prove a negative proposition more especially when the materials of our knowledge are so very few and so very defective  The Life of Virgil attributed to Donatus contains many characteristic particulars but which are lost in confusion and disgraced with a mixture of absurd stories such as none but a Monk of the darker ages could either invent or believe I always considered them as the interpolations of some more recent writer and am confirmed in that opinion by the life of Virgil pure from those additions which Mr Spence lately published from a Florence MS at the beginning of Mr Holdsworth's valuable observations on Virgil  and yet by glancing our eye over the several periods of Virgil's life we may perhaps attain a sort of probability which ought to have some weight since nothing can be thrown into the opposite scale  Altho' Virgil's father was hardly of a lower rank than Horace's yet the peculiar character of the latter afforded his fon a much superior education Virgil did not enjoy the same opportunities of observing mankind on the great Theatre of Rome or of pursuing Philosophy in her favourite shades of the Academy  Adjecêre bonae paulò plus artis Athenae  Scilicet ut possem curvo dignoscere rectum  Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum  Horat l II ep ii ver    The sphere of Virgil's education did not extend beyond Mantua Cremona Milan and Naples  Donat in Virgil    After the accidents of civil war had introduced Virgil to the knowledge of the Great he passed a few years at Rome in a state of dependance the JUVENUM NOBILIUM CLIENS  Horat l IV od xii  It was during that time that he composed his Eclogues the hasty productions of a Muse capable of far greater things  Donat in Virgil    By the liberality of Augustus and his courtiers Virgil soon became possessed of an affluent fortune  Prope  Centies Sestertium  about eighty thousand pounds  He composed the Georgics and the Aeneid in his elegant Villas of Campania and Sicily and seldom quitted those pleasing retreats even to come to Rome  Donat in Virgil    After he had finished the Aeneid he resolved on a journey into Greece and Asia to employ three years in revising and perfecting that Poem and to devote the remainder of his life to the study of Philosophy  Id ibid  He was at Athens with Augustus in the summer of AVC and whilst Augustus was at Athens the Eleusinian Mysteries were celebrated  They always began the fifteenth of the Attic month Boedromion and lasted nine days Those who take the trouble of calculating the Athenian Calendar on the principles laid down by Mr Dodwell de Cyclis Antiquis and by Dr Halley will find that A V C Varr the th of Boedromion coincided with the th of August of the Julian year But if we may believe Dion Cassius the Celebration was this year anticipated on account of Augustus and the Indian Philosopher L LIV p edit Reimar  It is not  impossible that Virgil might then be initiated as well as the Indian Philosopher  Strabo l xv p  but the Aeneid could receive no improvement from his newlyacquired knowledge He was taken ill at Megara The journey encreased his disorder and he expired at Brundusium the twentysecond of September of the same year  Donat in Virgil    Should it then appear probable that Virgil had no opportunity of learning the SECRET of the Mysteries it will be something more than probable that he has not revealed what he never knew  His Lordship will perhaps tell me that Virgil might be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries without making a Journey to Athens since those Mysteries had been brought to Rome long before  D L vol I p  Here indeed I should be apt to suspect some mistake or at least a want of precision in his Lordship's Ideas as Salmasius  Salmasius ad Scriptores Hist August p  and Casaubon  Casaubon ad Scriptor Hist August p  men tolerably versed in Antiquity assure me that indeed some Grecian Ceremonies of Ceres had been practised at Rome  from the earliest Ages but that the Mysteries of Eleusis were never introduced into that Capital either by the Emperor Hadrian or by any other And I am the more induced to believe that these rites were not imported in Virgil's time as the accurate Suetonius speaks of an unsuccessful attempt for that purpose made by the Emperor Claudius above threescore years after Virgil's death  Sueton in Claud c    II None but the Initiated COULD reveal the secret of the Mysteries and THE INITIATED COULD NOT REVEAL IT WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LAWS AS WELL OF HONORAS OF RELIGION I sincerely acquit the Bishop of Glocester of any design yet so unfortunate is his System that it represents a most virtuous and elegant Poet as equally devoid of taste and of common honesty  His Lordship acknowledges that the Initiated were bound to Secrecy by the most solemn obligations  D L vol I p  that Virgil was conscious of the imputed impiety of his design that at Athens he never durst have ventured on it that even at Rome such a discovery was esteemed not only IMPIOUS but INFAMOUS and yet his Lordship maintains that after the compliment of a formal Apology  Sit mihi fas audita loqui  Idem p    Virgil lays open the whole SECRET of the Mysteries under the thin Veil of an Allegory which could deceive none but the most careless readers  D L vol I p    An Apology an Allegory Such artifices might perhaps have saved him from the sentence of the Areopagus had some zealous or interested Priest denounced him to that court as guilty of publishing A BLASPHEMOUS POEM But the Laws of Honor are more rigid and yet more liberal than those of Civil Tribunals Sense not words is considered and Guilt is aggravated not protected by artful Evasions Virgil would still have incurred the severe censure of a Contemporary who was himself a man of very little Religion  Vetabo qui Cereris sacrum  Vulgârit arcanae sub iisdem  Sit trabibus fragilemque mecum  Solvat phaselum  Horat l III od ii    Nor can I easily persuade myself that the ingenuous mind of Virgil could have deserved this Excommunication  These lines belong to an Ode of Horace which has every merit except that of order That Death in our Country's cause is pleasant and honourable that Virtue does not depend on the caprice of a popular Election and that  the Mysteries of Ceres ought not to be disclosed are ideas which have no apparent connection The beautiful disorder of Lyric Poetry is the usual Apology made by Professed Critics on these occasions  Son style impetueux souvent marche au hazard  Chez elle un beau desordre est un effet de l' art  Boileau Art Poetique l ii v    An insufficient Apology for the few who dare judge from their own feelings I shall not deny that the irregular notes of an untutored Muse have sometimes delighted me We can very seldom be displeased with the unconstrained workings of Nature But the Liberty of an Outlaw is very different from that of a Savage It is a mighty disagreeable sight to observe a Lyric Writer of Taste and Reflection striving to forget the Laws of Composition disjointing the order of his Ideas and working himself up into artificial Madness  Ut cum Ratione insaniat  I had once succeeded as I thought in removing this defect by the help of an Hypothesis which connected the several parts of Horace's Ode with each other My Ideas appeared I mean to myself most ingeniously conceived I read the Ode once more and burnt my Hypothesis But to return to our principal subject  The Date of this Ode may be of use to us and the date may be fixed with tolerable certainty from the mention of the PARTHIANS who are described as the enemies against whom a brave youth should signalize his valor  Parthos  feroces  Vexet eques metuendus hastâ  c  Those who are used to the LABOURED HAPPINESS of all Horace's expressions  Curiosa Felicitas  The ingenious Dr Warton has a very strong dislike to this celebrated character of Horace I suspect that I am in the wrong since in a point of Criticism I differ from Dr Warton I cannot however forbear thinking that the expression  is itself  what Petronius wished to describe the happy Union of such Ease as seems the gift of fortune with such justness as can only be the result of care and labor  will readily allow that if the Parthians are mentioned rather than the Britons or Cantabrians the Gauls or the Dalmatians it could be only at a time when a PARTHIAN WAR engaged the public attention This reflection confines us between the years of Rome and Of these six years that of has a superior claim to the Composition of the Ode  Julius Caesar was prevented by death from revenging the defeat of Crassus  Sueton in Caesar c  This glorious task unsuccessfully attempted by Marc Antony  Plut in Vit Anton Julian in Caesar p edit Spanheim  seemed to be reserved for the prudence  and felicity of Augustus who became sole master of the Roman World in the year but it was not till the year that having changed the civil administration and pacified the Western provinces he had leisure to turn his Views towards the East From that time Horace in compliance with the Public wish began to animate both Prince and People to revenge the manes of Crassus  Horat l I od ii L III od v L II serm i v c  The cautious Policy of Augustus still averse to war was at length roused in the year by some disturbances in Armenia He passed over into Asia and sent the young Tiberius with an army beyond the Euphrates Every appearance promised a glorious war But the Parthian monarch Phrahates alarmed at the approach of the Roman Legions and diffident of the fidelity of his subjects diverted the storm by a timely and humble submission  Jus imperiumque Phraates

l XV c v Ovid Fast v ver c    Caesar returned in Triumph to Rome with the Parthian Hostages and the Roman ensigns which had been taken from Crassus  These busy scenes which engage the attention of Contemporaries are far less interesting to posterity than the silent labours or even amusements of a man of Genius  Caesar dum magnus ad altum  Fulminat Euphraten bello victorque volentes  Per Populos dat jura viamque adfectat Olympo  Illo Virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat  Parthenope studiis florentem ignobilis otî  Whilst Caesar humbled the Parthians Virgil was composing the Aeneid It is well known that this noble Poem occupied the Author without being able to satisfy him during the twelve last years of his life from the year to the year  Donat in Virgil  The public expectation was soon raised and the modest Virgil was sometimes obbliged to gratify the impatient curiosity of his friends Soon after the death of young Marcellus  Marcellus died in the latter end of the year  Usserii Annales    p    he recited the second fourth and SIXTH books of the Aeneid in the presence of Augustus and Octavia  Donat in Virgil  He even sometimes read parts of his work to more numerous companies with a desire of obtaining their judgment rather than their applause In this manner Propertius seems to have heard the SHIELD OF AENEAS and from that specimen he ventures  to foretell the approaching birth of a Poem which will surpass the Iliad  Actia Virgilium Custodis litora Phoebi  Caesaris fortes dicere posse rates  Qui nunc Aeneae Trojani suscitat Arma  Jactaque Lavinis moenia litoribus  Cedite Romani scriptores cedite Graii  Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade  Propert l II el xxv v    As a friend and as a Critic Horace was entitled to all Virgil's confidence and was probably acquainted with the whole progress of the Aeneid from the first rude sketch which Virgil drew up in Prose to that harmonious Poetry which the author alone thought unworthy of posterity  To resume my Idea which depended on this long deduction of Circumstances when Horace composed the second ode of his third Book the Aeneid and particularly the Sixth Book were already known to the Public The detestation of the Wretch who reveals the Mysteries of Ceres though expressed in general terms must be applied by all Rome to the author of the Sixth Book of the Aeneid Can we seriously suppose THAT HORACE WOULD HAVE BRANDED WITH SUCH WANT ON IN FAMY ONE OF THE MEN IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVED AND HONOURED THE MOST  Horat l I od iii L I serm v ver c    Nothing remains to say except that Horace was himself ignorant of his friend's allegorical meaning which the Bishop of Glocester has since revealed to the World It may be so yet for my own part I should be very well satisfied with understanding Virgil no better than Horace did  It is perhaps some such foolish fondness for Antiquity which inclines me to doubt whether the BISHOP OF GLOCESTER has really united the severe sense of ARISTOTLE with the sublime imagination of LONGINUS Yet a judicious Critic who is now I believe ARCHDEACON OF GLOCESTER assures the Public that his Patron's mere amusements have done much more than the joint labours of the two Grecians I shall conclude these observations with a remarkable passage from the Archdeacon's Dedication  See the Dedication of Horace's Epistle to Augustus with an English Commentary and Notes    It was not enough in YOUR ENLARGED VIEW OF THINGS to restore either of these models ARISTOTLE or LONGINUS to their original splendor They were both to be revived or rather A NEW ORIGINAL PLAN OF CRITICISM to be struck out WHICH SHOULD UNITE THE VIRTUES OF EACH OF THEM This Experiment was made on the two greatest of our own Poets  Shakespeare and Pope and by reflecting all the LIGHTS OF THE IMAGINATION ON THE SEVEREST REASON every thing was affected which the warmest admirer of antient art could promise himself from such a union BUT YOU WENT FARTHER By joining to these powers A PERFECT INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE and so ennobling the exercise of literary by the justest moral censure YOU HAVE NOW AT LENGTH ADVANCED CRITICISM TO ITS FULL GLORY  POSTSCRIPT  I WAS not ignorant that several years since the Rev Dr Jortin had favoured the Public with a DISSERTATION ON THE STATE OF THE DEAD AS DESCRIBED BY HOMER AND VIRGIL  Six Dissertations on Different Subjects published in a Volume in Octavo in the year It is the Sixth Dissertation p  But the Book is now grown so scarce that I was not able to procure a sight of it till after these Papers had been already sent to the press I found Dr Jortin's performance as I expected moderate learned and critical Among a variety of ingenious observations there are two or three which are very closely connected with my present subject  I had passed over in silence one argument of the Bishop of Glocester or rather of Scarron and the Bishop of Glocester since the former found the Remark and the latter furnished the Inference  Discite justitiam moniti non temnere Divos  cries the unfortunate Phlegyas In the midst of his torments he preaches Justice and Piety  like Ixion in Pindar A very useful piece of advice says the French Buffoon for those who were already damned to all Eternity  Cette sentence est bonne belle  Mais en enfer de quoi sert elle  From this judicious piece of Criticism his Lordship argues that Phlegyas was preaching not to the Dead but to the Living and that Virgil is only describing the Mimic Tartarus which was exhibited at Eleusis for the instruction of the Initiated  I shall transcribe one or two of the reasons which Dr Jortin condescends to oppose to Scarron's Criticism  To preach to the Damned says he is labour in vain And what if it is It might be part of his punishment to exhort himself and others when exhortations were too late This admonition as far as it relates to himself and his companions in misery is to be looked upon not so much as an admonition to amend but as a bitter sarcasm and reproaching of past iniquities  It is labour in vain But in the poetical system it seems to have been the occupation of the Damned to labour in vain to catch at meat and drink that fled from them c  His instruction like that of Ixion in Pindar might be for the use of the living You will say  how can that be  Surely nothing is more easy and intelligible The Muses hear himThe Muses reveal it to the Poet and the inspired Poet reveals it to mankind And so much for Phlegyas and Monsieur Scarron  It is prettily observed by Dr Jortin  That Virgil after having shone out with full splendor through the Sixth Book sets at last in a cloud  The IVORY GATE puzzles every Commentator and grieves every lover of Virgil Yet it affords no advantages to the Bishop of Glocester The objection presses as hard on the notion of an Initiation as on that of a real Descent to the Shades  The troublesome conclusion still remains as it was and from the manner in which the Hero is dismissed after the Ceremonies we learn that in those Initiations the Machinery and the whole Shew was in the Poet's opinion a representation of things which had no truth or reality  Altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto  Sed  FALSA  ad coelum mittunt  INSOMNIA  manes  Dreams in general may be called  vain  and  deceitful    somnia vana  or  somnia falsa  if you will as they are opposed to the  real  objects which present themselves to us when we are awake But when  false  dreams are opposed to  true  ones there the Epithet  falsa  has another meaning True dreams represent what is real and shew what is true false dreams represent things which are not or which are not true Thus Homer and Virgil and many other poets and indeed the nature of the thing distinguish them  Dr Jortin though with reluctance acquiesces in the common opinion that by six unlucky lines Virgil is destroying the beautiful System which it had cost him eight hundred to raise He explains too this preposterous conduct by the usual expedient of the Poet's Epicureism I only differ from him in attributing to haste and indiscretion what he considers as the result of design  Another reason both new and ingenious is assigned by Dr Jortin for Virgil explaining away his Hero's descent into an idle dream  All communication with the Dead the infernal powers c belonged to the Art Magic and Magic was held in abomination by the Romans  Yet if it was held in ABOMINATION it was supposed to be real A writer would not have made his court to James the first by representing the stories of Witchcraft as the Phantoms of an overheated Imagination  Whilst I am writing a sudden thought occurs to me which rude and imperfect as it is I shall venture to throw out to the Public It is this After Virgil in imitation of Homer had described the two Gates of Sleep the Horn and the Ivory he again takes up the first in a different sense  QUA VERIS FACILIS DATUR EXITUS UMBRIS  The TRUE SHADES VERAE UMBRAE were those airy forms which were continually sent to animate new bodies such light and almost immaterial Natures as could without difficulty pass through a thin transparent substance In this new sense Aeneas and the Sybill who were still incumbered with a load of flesh could not pretend to the prerogative of TRUE SHADES In their passage over Styx they had almost sunk Charon's boat  Gemuit sub pondere cymba  Sutilis multam accepit rimosa paludem  Some other Expedient was requisite for their return and since the Horn Gate would not afford them an easy dismission the other passage which was adorned with polished Ivory was the only one that remained either for them or for the Poet  By this explanation we save Virgil's judge+ment and religion though I must own at the  expence of an uncommon harshness and ambiguity of expression Let it only be remembered that those who in desperate cases conjecture with modesty have a right to be heard with indulgence  FINIS
