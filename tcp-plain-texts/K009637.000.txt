Printed for A DODD at the  Peacock  without  TempleBar  and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price  d  MDCCXXX  BLUNDRELLA  OR THE IMPERTINENT A TALE  _THE Tea was drank and ta'en away  No Soul had any thing to say  The Weather and the usual din  A fresh were going to begin  Fashion and Scandal drain'd before  On Carpet had been brought once more  But for  Blundrella  common Pest  Of the Polite the standing Jest  BLUNDRELLA  Idol of the Vain  And first in the Loquacious Train  In all things ignorant and weak  Yet on all Subjects would she speak  And of her own Perfections vaunted  Still daunting all herself undaunted  Of a most contradicting Spirit  And envious of another's Merit  This Creature thus with saucy Air  Addrest  Belinda  blooming Fair  MADAM I'm told you sing I long  To have the honour of a Song  Much better bred than to refuse  Belinda  pleads the old Excuse  She's caught a Cold and feigns a Cough  But that alas won't bring her off  Blundrella  urges her Request  Now seconded by all the rest  AT length unwilling to appear  Affected peevish or severe  The lovely Virgin tun'd her Voice  More out of Complaisance than Choice  While all were with her Musick pleas'd  But she who had the Charmer teaz'd  Who rude unmanner'd and abrupt  Did thus  Belinda  interrupt  MADAM said the affected Thing  Did you ne'er hear  Squallinda  sing  I've heard her sing that very Song  Would charm the whole Seraphic Throng  Of all the Singers her for me  She sings so sweet so clear so free  But Madam can't you sing another  That Song I hope has got a Brother  Let us have that which the  Fustina  Sings when she hangs on  Senisino    Its Name I have forgot no matter  'Tis that which makes the Boxes clatter  Or Madam but I beg your Pardon  There is a Song that in the Garden  Cuzzoni  sings unto her Son  That or another 'tis all one  BELINDA  blush'd with Shame and Rage  But yet unwilling to engage  So bold a Foe in such a Fray  She let the Creature have her Way  And tho' at sight she sung her Part  And was a Mistress in the Art  Pleaded her want of Voice and Skill  Which made  Blundrella  prouder still  Who grew insufferably vain  And alter'd both her Voice and Strain  SHE talk'd of Singers and Composers  Of their Admirers and Opposers  Of the  Cuzzoni  and  Faustini    Of  Handel  and of  Bononcini    One was to rough t'other to smooth  Artillo  only hit her Tooth  And  Tamo Tanto  was a Song  Would give her Pleasure all day long  FULL loftily she gave her Vote  This had no Voice and that no Throat  That  Heideigger  had receiv'd a Letter  And we should shortly have a better  A Messenger was sent to  Dover  To wait the Lady's coming over  Who should no sooner hither come  But she would strike all others dumb  SHE likewise grew exceeding witty  Upon the Consorts in the City  'Tis true she lik'd the  Castle  best  But yet she made 'em both a Jest  Nor did she much admire the  Crown    But as 'twas t'other End o' the Town  SHE next of Masters 'gan to preach  The  English  were not fit to teach  Italians  were the only Men  And ev'n of those not one in ten  For she had heard a Lady say  Scarce two in Town could sing or play  WHAT with Composers Players Singers  Performance Gusto Voices Fingers  She ran herself quite out of breath  And talk'd the Company to Death  WHEN haply with engaging Air  Eugenio  darling of the Fair  Who touches charmingly the Flute  Enter'd and struck  Blundrella  mute  And kept her Clacketernal under  For near a Minute There's a wonder  EUGENIO  must expect his Share  For scarce he had assum'd a Chair  But she impatient Silence broke  And thus th' Eternal Teazer spoke  NOW for a Tune my pretty Man  Nay you shall play say what you can  Ladies he's the delightful'st Creature  You never knew no Soul play sweeter  Nay prithee now don't make a Rout  Here 'tis Egad come pull it out  WHAT mortal Man could stand the Tryal  He must consent there's no denial  So for meer quiet Sake he plays  While she e'en stifles him with Praise  And worries the poor Man to death  Nor suffers him to take his breath  But calls for Tune on Tune so fast  Eugenio  is quite tir'd at last  And begs a Truce upon Parole  He'll play anon with all his soul  NOW you must know  Belinda  's Charms  Had giv'n his Heart no small Alarms  He was her Servant most avow'd  And happiest of the sighing Crowd  Sophronia  being her near Relation  Haply laid hold on this Cessation  And to  Eugenio  drawing near  She whisper'd softly in his Ear  Told him  Blundrella  's vile Assurance  And sweet  Belinda  's mild Endurance  EUGENIO  instantly was fir'd  Rage and Revenge his Mind inspir'd  He reassum'd his Spech and Flute  And thus  Blundrella  did salute  Madam said he before I go  Your dear Commands I'd gladly know  BLUNDRELLA  rear'd her Crest aloft  And begg'd him to play something soft  What think you Madam of  AL OMBRA  That's poor dull Stuff do ye like  SGOMBRA  Si Caro  if you please said she  He play'd the Tune of  Children three    She was in Raptures and intreated  The self same Tune might be repeated  HE chang'd his Airs and to her Shame  She took ten others for the same  In short  Eugenio  play'd her off  And made her all the Circle's Scoff  While stupid she ascrib'd to Wit and Sense  The Laughter rais'd by her Impertinence  THE BEAU MONDE OR THE Pleasures of St JAMES'S A BALLAD  To the Tune of  Oh  LONDON  is a fineTown  c  _OH St  James  's is a lovely Place  'Tis better than the City  For there are Balls and Operas  And ev'ry Thing that's pretty  There's little Lady  CUZZONI    And bouncing Dame  FAUSTINA    The Duce a Bit will either Sing  Unless they're each a  QUEENa    And when we've ek'd out History  And made them Rival Queens  They'll warble sweetly on the
