 THE TUTOR OF TRUTH BY THE AUTHOR OF THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE c c IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL II  However Hypocrisy may flourish for a time even its happiest moments are clouded and TRUTH shall at last prevail  LONDON Printed for RICHARDSON and URQUHART under the  Royal Exchange  M DCC LXXIX  THE TUTOR OF TRUTH  LETTER LIII G LASCELLES Esq to Capt CARLISLE  YOU are absolutely too effeminately scrupulous CARLISLEwhat I proposed was well meant However as your virtue is of a most obstinate anchoretical nature which neither love nor friendship can make a voluptuous  impression upon I shall quit the subject but not without saying that you are a very singular man and I question upon the whole whether the sex like you a bit the better for those scruples which stand so constantly betwixt you and a delicious offer  As to Miss DE GREY it is as impossible she can love such a flash in the pan such a match always lighted as MEDWAY as it is impossible for her to live in the same house with CLEMENT CARLISLE and not be however secretly in raptures with himthat is to sayif his  ice  does not lie in the way Seriously CLEMENT  you  make difficulties where I should go as smoothly as upon a carpet The Marchioness remains quiet and I am your entire friend  GEORGE LASCELLES  LETTER LIV From the Same to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT  Dear ANDREW  THE stratagem takes I have written the letter we projected and it answers our expectation He could not bear the ideahe was hurthe could not believe his eyeshe would not do her such a violence for the world But you knew his virtue I judge it is owing in a great degree to my caution in directing to you in a  counterfeit  hand that has kept our correspondence so long as private as we wished it for had I written in my usual character a single letter would have betrayed me  to CARLISLE with whom I have lived on terms of absolute intimacy for ten years without his ever suspecting me to be a  jolly  fellow So easy is it for men of spirit to impose upon these mighty good kind of men Never surely was any thing half so apropos as his putting the Marchioness under my careor rather my sister's who really thinks me as great a saint as CARLISLE himself But to come to the point it may certainly be contrived for you to take unto your bosom this Italian treasureCARLISLE refuses her that's one pleayou are a fine fellow that's anotheryou have money that's greater than even the former her passions are awake that's number in your favour she is married and therefore above the folly of sollicitationnumber her constitution glows like the torrid zonenumber She abhors  the Marquiscount  nine  for that In short she will she must she  shall  be your'sAs to the arrival of the Marquis do not apprehend any danger from that quarter I have counteracted the contents of the letter from CARLISLE you may depend on it It is by your LASCELLES so ordered that if he goes at all in search of his  Perdita  he will not direct his course to England but to a very different quarter of the globe I will prepare every other grand essential even till your bed is dressed with roses In the mean time keep HEATHCOATE ignorant of the business and continue to use or rather to amuse  him  with the  ridiculous  that results from your play upon the HODSONS DREWSONS HEWSONSwhat the plague is their vulgar name He is a worthy fellow but not fit for  such  a plot as the  presenttherefore till the deed be done keep him out of it  As to the Lady's beauty depend on your old caterer for that I have a hawk's eye at a pretty wench To say the truth the Marchioness is more to your taste than any I have had the honour and friendship to recommend Her eyes have just that fluid floating in them and are exactly of that brilliant black you like her nose is turned to the perfection of  your  beautya little on the aquiline and set off by a pair of brows so markingly expressive of pleasure that you may depend upon them Then her lips is first of that superior order without corpulence and so full of majesty without haughtiness that most attaches you Her bosom is finely filled and rises as the poet emphatically  terms it "suing to be pressed" Her arms hands fingers are likewise all suited to you But enough She is to be the subject of a much closer criticism than it is even possible for me to give  Once more however let me charge you by an old and serviceable friendship never to breathe the name of LASCELLES in any way not consistent with every thing sacred You know my loss of a damned fortune at one stroke of the die first reduced me to this As it was impossible to hold  still the elbow  something was necessary to repair my mischance and literally speaking keep me  in play  besides which I was to live as I had ever been used to do I was to be the same character Two paths presented themselves  the one led to the gallows by the way of pursegathering the other to the accommodation of a friend by the way of  woman  I saw  you  loved you valued your  health  and chose the latter path You know how I have succeeded let the ample catalogue of your passions gratified in every form convince you of it You  only  I served you only know me to be not absolutely a CARLISLE I once more repeat to you the necessity of burning every letter and every slip of paper you get from me the moment it comes to hand if a syllable at any time transpires I am destroyed for ever the consequence of which irreparable injury is that I must cut your throat But keep our counsel and you shall be the very Jupiter of a seraglio  I  shook  hard last night my hand trembles this morning at the disappointment Pray send fifty pieces to take off by way of bracer  Adieu  LASCELLES  LETTER LV Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to G LASCELLES Esq  GEORGY  THOUGH BLESSINGBOURNE has not yet honoured my last draughts and I have but just an hundred pieces about me I nevertheless divide chearfully with youMy purse is your's How canst talk so childishly about disclosure of secrets Could you not have me cut into piecemeal by fathers brothers aunts mothers and cousins if I were ridiculous enough to blab I adore woman to  please  me and men to  laugh  at  You  very liberally supply  me with the one kind of gratification HEATHCOATE with the other Neither jars with the other's province and I have money enough to support you both As to character I like it as well as you and except laughing at men and lying with women I solemnly declare I would not do a wrong thing for the world But every man to his passionsthose are mine You rejoice my heart with repeating to me in every letter the personal charms of CARLISLE's fair follower 'Tis a confounded thing though to consider she is so taken with CARLISLE and yet to do him justice he is an elegant glorious fellow Every day marks the goodness of his heart and you would be an ingrateful dog to say a syllable against him If you can  prevent all risque  for though you fight for me I hate quarrels I will be satisfied with your success by the middle of  next month In the mean time I have a game of my own to play Just such a one as I can manage without assistance Not a snap of the finger of peril attending the whole enterprise But HEATHCOATE is my correspondent in this adventure it is not of  importance  enough for the ambitious GEORGE LASCELLES whom even a Marchioness cannot deter from his attempts the object of my present humble aspiring is only the wife of the most grazierlooking HAL HEWSON But mum not a word more on a subject that does not belong to you HEATHCOATE is the man for trifles and laugh MEDWAY is as usual the most sullen rascal in Europe he was going to run me through the body the other day for tossing down a tumbler of fair water which though I swear it was an accident he insisted was done with an illnatured design to spot  his waistcoatCARLISLE who is ever a peacemaker interfered or else I should most likely have written to you from Elysium  Your's A F  LETTER LVI The Earl of BLESSINGROURNE to Mr DE GREY  SIR  YOU did not remember either me or my overtures respecting my nephew Sir ANDREW by the post Certainly you are  ill  and therefore I send to make friendly inquiries after your health As to any  other  cause of your delay it is impossible to be conceived for how should so wellinformed a gentleman as Mr DE GREY forget what is due to a very splendid offer from one of the  oldest peers in the realm  The Countess renews her compliments I am in hourly expectation of a dukedom your address however at present is as usual to the Right Hon the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE  I am Sir your's BLESSINGBOURNE  LETTER LVII Captain CARLISLE to Mr LASCELLES  THOUGH your last relished more my dear LASCELLES of the  inconsiderate  than I hope belongs to your character yet it set my heart at rest upon the subject of the Marchioness  Another strange circumstance has happened in this family Two days after I had returned such a reply to Mr DE GREY's letter as appeared to me proper and consistent he put into my hands a letter from BLESSINGBOURNE who had made formal overtures of marriage betwixt Miss DE GREY and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT Nothing ever  excited more real astonishment for I had never once dreamt of a treaty coming from that quarter knowing so perfectly as I do LUCIA's  opinion  of Sir ANDREW The epistle was penned with all the titleswelled vanity connected with the BLESSINGBOURNE character and coronets crests and supporters lions rampant spread eagles and fields azure danced through every line Having commented upon the style with a good humour which is above turning the result of a man's infirmity into a cause of affront Mr DE GREY asked me my opinion of the match  Pray heaven I may never undergo so severe a trial as I sustained in the process of the following short but most agonizing conversation of which you will have the more perfect idea from  dialogue It past in Mr DE GREY's library  Mr DE GREY  I have ever made you my dear Mr CARLISLE my confident upon various occasions we have never canvassed together a  love affair  Though you tell me  you  are to have a little more knowledge of society before you venture upon a wife yet I know you to have a very competent judgement of these things because you have ever been an accurate observer This letter before us opens to you a secret of the utmost consequence to your friends Peace What do you think of it  CARLISLE  Siryou must certainlybebe the best judge of these matters'Tis too nice a point  Mr DE GREY  Riches you know are out of the question Titles do not glow in my eyes as they do in those of his Lordship  CARLISLE  OhMr DE GREYwhatwhat are titles toto  DE GREY  To what my CLEMENT  CARLISLE  I beg pardon SirPerhaps a  Countess  may not displease even the amiable Miss DE GREY  DE GREY  What you would advise her then to the match would you my friend  CARLISLE  Who  I  adviseGracious God forbid that Ithat isI should be sorry any thing might from my advice turn out sososo as  DE GREY  Nobody to be sure can answer for events but what do  you think  of Sir ANDREW my dear CARLISLE  CARLISLE  What does Miss DE GREY think of him Sir  DE GREY  That's what I meant rather to ask you As an old friend I did not know but she might have let you into the secret  CARLISLE  What  secret Sir  DE GREY  Perhaps you think more highly of  Mr Medway  I was ready to sink into the earth LASCELLES at this question  CARLISLE  Of Mr MEDWAY SirTo be sure MEDWAYMr MEDWAY certainly Sirif he meets the Lady's approbation  DE GREY  At any rate I will decline his Lordship's offer I am persuaded LUCIA has no sort of affection for Sir ANDREW He is too light too volatileNow  that  objection does not I think lie  against MEDWAY He is a strange  headed  but I believe he is a good  hearted  creature Do you think  this  person a better match  CARLISLE  He has made offers then Sir has he  DE GREY  Admitting he had is he a man you would have me fix on  CARLISLE  If to Miss DE GREY he were agreeable Sirto be sureyouyouyou could not do better  DE GREY  Tell me frankly my dearest Captain do you know any body whom  you think she likes  better  in the tender way we speak of  CARLISLE  Sirlikes betterlikes better than Mr MEDWAY  DE GREY  Aye my friendI could wish her happiness to depend in some measure upon your choice Perhaps neither Sir ANDREW nor MEDWAY are the men you would fix onBe candiddo you knoware you acquainted with any person who you think loves her more tenderly  CARLISLE  More tenderlyoh yes my dear Mr DE GREY ten thousand times more tenderlyoh God of heaven  DE GREY  You charm me with the tydings Pray name him to meIs he young Is he amiableIs he steadyhas he any of the virtues that distinguish the ofof  Here LASCELLES the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of MEDWAY himself who came bursting into the library for his fishing pole  Never was man relieved more critically We were talking of you Mr MEDWAY said Mr DE GREY hushhushcried MEDWAY emphatically extending his finger'Tis plain Mr DE GREY has fixed  his  heart as well as LUCIA  her's  on this man Yet what a strange conversation For heaven's  sake help me if possible to a clue Yet MEDWAYdepend on it MEDWAY is the man to the terror of  Your CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER LVIII Mr DE GREY to the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE  MY LORD  THE importance of the consideration to both the young parties concerned and the regard that is due to the natural inclinations as to the acquired affections are the apologies I have to offer for  appearing  to neglect a suitable return of acknowledgment for the honour of your Lordship's letter and for the ample proposals it contained  Prior  to the receipt of your Lordship's favour I made some attempt to  obtain the secret of my child's heart and  since  I have made a like attempt upon the heart of  another  person Not my Lord that it is possible for me to prefer any gentleman to the nephew of the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE but because I suspected an affection subsisting elsewhere I think my Lord I have discovered a passion in my daughter and a  return  of it in a certain young friend of mine that may possibly grow in a little time into a circumstance of essential consequence  Within a few days I shall be more assured of this and if my child proves to have a heart not preengaged there can be no doubt of her soon becoming sensible of the great honour of an alliance with so near a branch of the BLESSINGBOURNE family On the contrary if it should turn out that her affections  are already possessed it will appear obvious to your Lordship that as in such a case she cannot reward the tenderness of Sir ANDREW she can have no just title to the many dignities and the immense fortunes which would follow such a union  What I would invite then from your Lordship is a short  suspension  that the matter may lie open I again repeat that a few days will naturally determine every thing In the mean time Sir ANDREW had better I conceive remain unacquainted with our treaty left it should any way terminate to his dissatisfaction On  my  part I will hasten the necessary discovery as much as in my power although your Lordship will easily imagine a father's power in a point of so much importance is not very extensive when the father  is convinced of his child's integrity and discretion  I shall be happy my Lord to hear that the mode I have submitted to your Lordship is crowned with your approbation  I  distinguish  myself when I present my most humble compliments to the Countess and I have the honour to be  My Lord  your Lordship's Most devoted and obedient servant ROBERT DE GREY  LETTER LIX The Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE to R DE GREY Esq  SIR  THE Countess and I had no conception of such a reply to our very distinguishing overtures in favour of a young person utterly  untitled  we receive a very ill return from you Mr DE GREY Our visit to Prudence Place was principally out of an old friendship and because we thought your daughter a very decent prudent person to  promote a match  between her and our nephew We offered the most peculiar splendours we offered lineal  honoursbut we are desired to wait the issue of  another treaty  And pray Sir may we ask which or who it is amongst your friends that ought to have the first offer in preference to the nephew and heir of the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE I shall not mention the clear annual rentroll of near fifty thousand guineas a year that will devolve to him nor will I rest my consequence upon the superbest equipage nor on the most magnificent seats in Europe I confine myself to that illustrious line into which the arms of your young Lady would be if I may so say  encoated  Every body can tell Mr DE GREY I am not a boaster but indeed your tardy conduct borders somewhat upon incivility and disrespect The Countess thinks so too Nevertheless we still think your LUCIA would adorn a coronet she is her favourite  A little intercourse with my Lady after marriage would make herwould properly speaking  prepare  her for her new honours Once more therefore we offer our services to you again and upon the full assurance of your immediate consent the Countess and I are proceeding to measures that may bring the point to a crisis  I am Sir Your most obedient servant BLESSINGBOURNE  LETTER LX From the Same to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT at R DE GREY's Esq  Dear ANDREW  WE have reasons to desire you will look upon  Lucia De Grey  as upon a Lady that is first to be the Lady FLIGHT and afterwards Countess of BLESSINGBOURNE if not of a rank still higher She will be informed of this circumstance at the same time  you  are and as soon as certain preliminaries between Mr DE GREY and I are adjusted the ceremony shall be compleated To be sure the honours are every one in  our  hands but never mind that she is  a beautiful woman and with regard to honours as they cannot be divided we are contented to  bestow  them in consideration of her merit and person  I shall  give  you very liberally and I send you now a bill for present use though bytheby it astonishes both me and the Countess how you can continue to squander such sums in a country village during the time of a visit  Adieu  BLESSINGBOURNE  LETTER LXI The Countess of BLESSINGBOURNE to Miss DE GREY  Miss DE GREY  I HAVE prevailed on the Earl to suffer ANDREW our nephew to offer you his hand The acceptance of it is a point so much out of the question that it would be ridiculous to mention it To do you justice you are the only young woman I know of  no descent  who could sit at  my  righthand upon a visit to certain people without disgracing me Nay more I  believe your being  about me  a little when you are Lady LUCIA FLIGHT for I dare say you will wait patiently for my coronet a few years will totally finish you both for a carriage and a drawingroom This is saying very much Lady LUCIA'Pshaw I am so used to write only to people of condition that I declare I can scarce reconcile my pen to a Miss or a MadamThis Miss DE GREY is I say allowing great matters for you I know but four people upon earthand one of them is a crowned headwho can either sit in a sedan carry themselves in a coach or fill a chair  On the day of marriage which shall not be distant if Mr DE GREY behaves prudently I shall decorate you with my own hand Mean while you  will doubtless become sensible of the accomplishments of your future husband  Adieu  C of B  LETTER LXII Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr HEATHCOATE  HERE is a fine piece of work cut out HEATHCOATE Aunt and uncle have resolved to marry me to LUCIA DE GREY The old foolish Lord hath sent me a letter which set me laughing for a whole hour He bids me look upon the damsel as upon the happy she who is to be the  cara sp  sa  of Sir ANDREW FLIGHT He bids me prepare for marriagemarriage HEATHCOATE If I ever marrywhy thenBut by the sacred souls  of all the Lords Barons Farls Dukes Dutchesses Popes Cardinals Kings and Grand Monarques that went before me I will turn this event to some pleasant advantage I say pleasant because to think upon it  seriously  is quite and clean out of the question LUCIA DE GREY is too modest yet too aweful and too mucha thousand times too much hovered over by a set of cutthroat fellows who would slice me and eat me were I to pretend to the serious fact And between ourselves I believe both CARLISLE and MEDWAY are in her train To say the truth she is a woman I can never laugh either  with  or  at  for as to the former I never could make her smile at the expence of another in my whole life no not even the HEWSONS who might set the muscles of the very devil upon the simper and  as to the latter she does every thing so unaffectedly that ridicule is obliged to give up the subject in despair Then she has a cursed method of  looking  so as to command deference and therefore beautiful as she is I hate to be in her companynevertheless HEATHCOATE if I do not draw from this precious epistle of my uncle some divine  un  but enoughtime will shew  I am now likely to be in the very meridian of my species of enjoyment after much fatigue of  laughing  I have brought the HEWSONS to the true perfection of absurditya very little time will shew you that the ludicrous can go no farther than I have made it go in themSuch joysuch frolicsuch but it would be absolutely iniquitous to forestall the businessno let it take  you by surprizelet it come on you unawareslet it seize you unprepared and deluge your cheeks in tears of extacy  Farewell  A F  LETTER LXIII Mr GABRIEL HEWSON to Miss DE GREY  Charming Madam  IT is impossible to have been so long burning under the torrid rays of your transporting beams of beauty without becoming sensible to their piercingheartpiercing fervour As well might the tender bud lie on the shore of India without being parched by the favours of Apolloa titled gentleman now at my elbow but whose name I am not yet entitled to disclose is as it were my guardian genius and tells me that you charming Madam  have within these few days been pleased out of the benignity of your gracious self to speak of my parts and person with some  condescending complacency  This emboldens me charming Madam to say that I think you are the most incomparable piece of  celestial workmanship in the way of woman  that ever glowed under the astonished eyes of a small spectatorthe natural consequence of all this Madam is that I am the humblest of your idolaters I find charming Madam met in you all the graces which Horace Pliny Homer Virgil and all other writers ancient or modern give to their several favourites Your lips are sweeter than those attributed to Briseisyour hair has more of the  nitidus  in it than belonged to  that  which was the distinguishing property of the divine Lyce's and your  air  is considerably more ennobled than  that of the majestic Dido Queen of Carthage celebrated in the Aeneid written by Virgil  I should never charming Madam have presumed to address such ambitious sentiments to your exalted elegance were I not told that you prefer scientific superiority to personal perfection Some persons have been pleased to flatter me with possessing pretty fully the laurels of the  first  excellence and as to the  last  though nature hath not endowed me altogether with the graces of a CARLISLE yet I find in my glass an alteration somewhat for the better every day and hope in the end to  step  without any kind of embarrassment  I take lovesecrets to be amongst the  sanctum sanctorum  of  arduus rebus  and therefore I beg  this  may be confined  to the sacred shrine of your most beautiful bosom  I am charming Madam Your obsequious slave in rosy fetters GABRIEL HEWSON  P S  Omnia vincit amor  LETTER LXIV Mr HENRY HEWSON to Mr HEATHCOATE Esq  Esquire  I HAVE not  catched  up goose feather for some time Case why because I was amind to gee time for the perfaction of the thingI am got a woundly way since my last and fancy a couple o'weeks more will finish me that is if Sir ANDREW sticks close by me and I continues to  practise  the thingCase why  practise  makes parfect To shew you that I ha' not been silent for nothing I must let you know that  I ha'n't chang'd ten words with HETT this week Case why what's so far from the goe of the genteel gig as to take notice of one's houshold spouse before company 'specially when a body is learning a  touch of the times  To say truth her lips looked develish ruddy  t'other  day and I lent um a smack that echoed like waggon whipfor I could not help it seeing that's she's one of your dainty onesbut Sir ANDREW soon took me aside and ga' me a bit of a lesson and made me heartily ashamed  on't  I must let you know too that I manage my little bit of a  black sack  bobbishly  thof  ribbons and flourrididdles at sides tickle nape o' one's neck consumedly Neither do I look so damn'd ugly as might be surspected regard to frenchfied foretop and hairbundles stuck out side of one's head Fat of  one's feace helps to take of hugeness of thing which is but natural seeing that  one  swells out  t'other  and this makes feace and hair go as a man may say cheekbyjowl without quarreling It's pity I'm given to  sweattin  so much as I find it don't do at all for a bettermost person I ha' got half dozen fine white handkerchiefs but they're so cussed  cambrickey  that they are nothing in such a  grepe  as mine and I melt so this fmoaking weather that I make '  em  every mother's son quite of a stew Truth is I begin to see  pliteness  has like every thing else 'vantages and not 'vantages When I was an ignoramus I used to sit in hall or ride to hayfield with nightcap on head or coloured handkerchief under hat for 'vantage of dripping in summertide but no such matter  now  there's nothing  so illbred as to be caught  sweattin  nay more than that 'tis quite out of the goe of the thing to  mention  the very word'tis  sweattin  with fellers of yesterday but I find 'tis  presfieration  with folks that are obliged to be  desunt  Sir ANDREW has been  t me some time seeing I can't keep this  presfieration  to myself to bleed and bolus for six weeks or so that I may vacuate some of my  moister  and dry up my porusses abit What do  you  think of this Esquire I hate purgers as I hate  LuciferSatancotus  as Gab calls him but I would even  potecarryarize  myself for sake of good breeding To tell you the truth there is sort of a pleasant comical  nothingatall  in the life of your bettermost genii that I like mortationly well indeed I warrant you we went it round the great garden last night by moonshine  for two hoursnone but your tiptop specie giggling and going it all the timeclackclackclack yesyesyesnononoha ha hahe he hetitum titumtitidumPardon me Madampardon me Miss  Skuse  me Sirout with the footoff with the hatdown with the breechoh EsquireEsquire HEATHCOATE 'tis just the thing to a T Last night a little afore we went awalkin I finished  giving the hand  as they call itthat is to say getting a pretty lady over a gutter for instanceor handin her over a puddle or any thing the same wayallowing for th'alteration I was once before I had my fortune low enough to say on such  cassion  Come Bet Het Pol Mol Fan Kit or what notallowing for the alteration Come gee us your fist or tip us your  daddleor lends hold o' your forefoot else may hap you may draggle the tail o' you in the water Odds merciful miserecordibus as Gab says no such thing now by a million  Contrary  so much that one of the best things a bettermost body  can  do is to manage this matter as't should be Sir ANDREW himself for sample is the greatest dabster in the world at it For instance  there's  he  there's  a woman and  there's  a crossing or a slippihin of waterwash mayhap we'll say covered o'er with stepping stones  Now  mark Esquire Now comes your jemmy workWell get over they mustIndulge me Miss or Madam or my Lady says he allowing for th'alteration with the favor of your fair handSir you are very  plite  Wellwhat's next Whew she's a t'other side But how the miserecordibus  did she get there I wonder says you Ah there lies the point Now I'll tell you First Miss c allowing for the alteration tucks up piece of petticoat sets her pretty foot on stepping stone shews dainty turn'd ancle and is obliged for the sake of bettermost breedin to look a little as if she was scar'd Oh Lordsays sheFear not dear creature divine angel noble Madam magnanimous Miss c allowing for the alterationfear nothing then Esquire he  takes  her hand and  takes  her waist and gis her a  querrick  and they  take  a little bit of a thing 'twixt a hop and a jump and he kisses her glove and bends hinderpart and bows head and gets grin into's feace and gis a bit of he he he and shews his white powderpurg'd grinders andand'tis all over as neat as the  Lady's leg I ha' been a long while on this head case 'tis almost half way clean up to the top genii and Sir ANDREW 'clares 'pon his honour no gentleman can do long without itI ha' practis'd hugely and I find I am up to every part of the puddlepliteness 'cept  pousing  out hinderpart and getting the grin In aiming at the first matter I ha' overset one of Master DE GREY's china jars for the thing is natural I a'n't made quite so plite as I should be 'bout the bottom of waist or mayhap a little bit farder so it's out of the question for me to wriggle't as little and limberly as such a fine genteel greyhoundham'd son of a gentleman as Sir ANDREW The grin too is as I just now said a hard thing to hit off I can't for soul of me find out any thing to make a man laugh at getting  a woman over a cartret and as to laughing where one don't see the joke and where the thing is one almost nothing at all I never could do it since I was born Besides why I am so cuss'd  covered  about the gills that if I could laugh as heartily as Sir ANDREW 'twould not do for my cheeks are too  solidum firmus  if a man chose to be learned that it's enough to crack one's cheek furniture I begin to day to learn to hold my tongue or else talk about nothing just as cassion sees fit Hett gets on at a pure size Sir ANDREW is giving her a lectur about airs and high notions fanflutteringhemming and the like now in the garden Gab would do very well if his larning did not stand in his way But we shall all be fit to be seen in a short time before we go back tho' as to coming  near Captain CARLISLE that's impossible yet I am sure he never took any pains to be bettermost for every thing he does looks too easy for thatsame thing with Miss LUCIA  Esquire farewell Or vally as Gab says  Your's H HEWSON  LETTER LXV Mrs HEWSON to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT  YOU assure me there is nothing more common than for elegant people to write to each other while they are under the same roof You propose Lord and Lady SHUTTLECOCK of your acquaintance as examples who you tell me when even they are chagrin'd retire to their chambers and keep the waitingwoman upon the hurryscurry with carrying notes of reproach to and fro for several hours Well I protest I wish the practice were universal for it's mighty pretty but  then  indeed it would become vulgar and after that it would  nauseate  Miss LUCIA is so filled with spleen and megrim that there is no getting an answer out of  her  As to corresponding with  you  Sir ANDREW whom I  see  every hour what can I possibly have to say If you wish me upon paper as well as in person to assure you that I most cordially detestdetest  every thing  that was once most charming I  will  repeat it No truth was ever clearer Those lasses who were favourites formerly in my village are  now  as detestable to me as the village itself I was once so great a novice as to find pleasure in seeing my rustic neighbours walk in their Sunday dresses with their happy homely husbands and assemble in the shade My foolish heart leapt as they sat singing at their doors or working at their windowsthe very  hollohowdoyou  and  hailfellowwellmet  had all attractions for meThe  smell of an haycart was pleasure and the sight of an harvesthome absolute extacy Note the alteration I am wholly  inverted  in point of pleasure if on my return to HelterSkelterHall which is fitting up I feel any satisfaction from the sight of people working at windows or singing at doors it will be upon account of the pride of comparing  their  grovelling situation with  mine  if I bear the noise of an haycart it will be only from reflecting that my  carriagehorses  for such I will have shall fare the better for itIf I can again reconcile to myself the presence of lads and wenches  dizened  out in their foolish finery it will only be for the joy of my sweeping by them in magnificence that shall make them shy off with amazement and if an harvesthome can ever more become supportable it will only be from the consideration  that it comes but once a year and is then over for a twelvemonth What other arguments can I use to convince you of my readiness to adopt the modes and manners you speak of As to Mr HEWSONhe is a very good creature and when you have done with him I shall love him better than ever I cannot come into your opinion about the  elopement  you speak of be it ever so fashionable for I most assuredly  do  love Harry and therefore it is impossible Your assertions of  tenderness  to me I am to take you know as mere effects of sentiments which are to come  of course  and as such they are very gallant I shall not indeed be in any degree angry with you for the continuance of such civilities in the way of promoting breeding Nor will I scruple any thing so accomplished a gentleman proposes except the elopement scheme which I  again say I can never consent to Any thing else I obeynay I have convinced you of it I do not speak to Harry  before company  I walk and step as different as possible from what I did I perceive the absolute necessity of only occasionally  hearing  and  seeing  I find every now and then as violent a desire to faint after a little decent walking as Lady BLESSINGBOURNE herselfI was almost expiring with the smell of violets last night  in my room  though I used to doat on them I can drink two glasses and  exactly  another half of wine and waterMy dinners of late never digest without a drop of ratasia Those drops and restoratives which I before never heard of but in  books  are now a part of my existence I can bear no smells but such as are  artificial  Every thing  natural  actually turns upon my stomach I used to rise at six I  am now never up till near twelveI used to let my arms brave the sunbeamsI now sleep in glovesI used to defy the tan I now never venture to stir without a shade  What would you wish more  My seven o'clock lesson in LUCIA'S bower shall certainly not be forgotten Mean time I have the great honour to be  Sir ANDREW FLIGHT'S most obedient and very humble servant HENRIETTA HEWSON  LETTER LXVI Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  O MISS LASCELLES what strange and unaccountable confusions are every hour happening in this house Here is now come down formal overtures from Lord BLESSINGBOURNE for the ever fickle Sir ANDREW FLIGHT The Countess too has written to me in a way that ought to make me ill satisfied with her My father has had a letter and Sir ANDREW himself received encouragement in this business from  his own vanity  He sent into my

 and at your leisure make acquainted with its determinations  Your ANDREW FLIGHT  LETTER LXVII Mr DE GREY to the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE  MY LORD  I CAN now take upon me to say I should do some violence to my child's inclination and perhaps wound the bosom of another person equally dear to me were I to carry on any longer the most distant idea of a tender connexion betwixt her and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT It is impossible that I should reply to more of your Lordship's last  peculiar  letter or indeed that I should with any propriety  lengthen this letter beyond adding to it the name of  Your Lordship's obedient and most humble servant ROBERT DE GREY  LETTER LXVIII Captain CARLISLE to G LASCELLES  IF I described to you in my last a scene that was painful I have now one to relate that is dreadful Mr DE GREY again desired today a conference with meMiss DE GREY was to partake of itTen minutes  before  we had met accidentally in the garden and after a moment's pause of confusion parted precipitately by different walksThis'  second  interview therefore came upon us before the anxiety occasioned by the first had worn off Our disorder became exceedingly visible and neither of us spoke for a minute though during that minute it was the  elaborate design of both to speak Have you not received a  letter  said Mr DE GREY to LUCIA  A letter Sir said she trembling  Yes my dear from  From Miss LASCELLES do you mean Sir Oh yes I had one this day  NO LUCIA I mean from the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE  From Lord BLESSINGBOURNE papa  Here LASCELLES  I  rose as if to withdraw  Pray Mr CARLISLE don't leave us no business can happen at  this house  without your being a welcome party Yes my dear LUCIA I mean from the Earl  No indeed Sir  Nor from the Countess  Yes SirII must confess I  am  honoured with one from the Countess  May I see it  If I have it about me Sirbut I am afraidoh nohere it is  Read it to us my dear girl we know what the Countess can doand I have I believe the fellow

us  I  Sir  Then  I  will  Here LASCELLES he read first the Earl's and then that of the Countess upon which I had the rashness to exclaimI am not very apt to give way to my indignation but if I had here that  scoundrel  Lord who can suffer his wife to insult  such  a woman as Miss DE GREY I'd twist his nose off  Oh my dear LASCELLES what a scene ensued LUCIA turned pale fixed her eyes upon me in a kind of gentle reproach and after making an effort to retire she fell lifeless on the  floor God of Heaven what did I feel at that momentShe continued to rise only to faint againI kneeled downI caught her in my armsMy tears bathed her beautiful handI staggered under the weight of her through enfeebling agonyHer dear lips quiveredI leaned down in my confusion even till I felt  her  cheek upon  mine  I kissed the tears awayHer father was speechlessShe revived a little but again relapsed and without alarming any other part of the house which her delicacy desired might be the case she was conducted by Mr DE GREY into her apartment He is still by her sideI went out in an agony and I write this in the same situation What can possibly be the meaning of all thisIs  Sir Andrew  then at last the manWas she so  violently  hurt at my menace against Lord BLESSINGBOUNE  Does her passion extend to the very  roots  of the family What then becomes of  Medway  Whatever be the truthit is certain that LUCIA DE GREY is wretched and therefore it is impossible the most poignant misery should be escaped by the unfortunate  CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER LXIX Mr LASCELLES to Captain CARLISLE  I HAVE the

imagines I was fool enough to send to CARLISLEOne written since upon the same subject I preserve just to send you by way of specimenAll the glorious fire which she expresses there shall in due time burn for youI GEORGE  LASCELLES the successful have said it My sister has written twice to Miss LUCIA of lateShe always gives me her packets to put in the officeNot knowing but she might say something improper of the violent Marchioness I threw the aforesaid packets not into the office but into the fireMy head and hands are full but the Lady is beyond every thing that was ever before seen on this side Heaven and so I shall go through it with spirit for the sake of my beloved Baronet  I have been thinking that a few new  trinkets  might soften a hard place or twoshe came unaccommodated you know If you were to supply this matter you might perhaps get her  vanity  in your favourthat is a wonderful point gained When  afterwards  she came to know that one of the  richest as well as neatest men

H's appointment I must needs swagger away into the garden where I knew  MEDWAY the monster had just withdrawn with his angle He was standing with his eyes fixed intently upon the line greedily devouring the dancing cork upon the stream when I passed by on the opposite side as not seeing him The Earl's letter was in my handI appeared to be tickled to the soul I affected to hold my sides with the pain of laughing I mentioned the name of  Lady  LUCIA thrice with rapture My hero threw down his fishingrod and coming round to me with inconceivable violence and the most scarlet visage you ever beheld even more  a flame  than a setting sun he cries outPuppy jackanapes what did you frighten away my fish for the largest carp that ever was seen nibbled that moment at my bait Had it not been for

are no secrets'Tis to be a public affair OLLY There is the letter for thy inspection  He took it hastily  While he was swallowing the contents up came Captain CARLISLE but seeing us engaged with his usual politeness was going to take another part of the garden As if from some secret impulse that  worse  was at hand  I beckoned him He walked towards me  So then you are a fellow who make pretensions to Miss DE GREY are you  I did by no means like a certain illlook about his eyes and therefore replied mildlyAs to that my dear OLLY you may easily see it was all my uncle's doingMy uncle you see  Your uncle be damned replied he Have you written to the Lady yourself  Written to the Lady my dear OLLY written to the Ladywhy as to a letter to the Lady  Look ye Sir ANDREW as I know you don't run into danger I shall not hurt you but I must just inform you casually that for equivocating you are a most abominable coward and as to the matter of daring but to  think  of Miss LUCIAhushhushmy dear say no more upon that subjectI shall be satisfied with giving you to the fish that's all  At the close of this speech he caught hold of my arm and would absolutely have twirled me souse into the pond had not CARLISLE ran briskly to my rescue and saved me from the barbarian's fury He even told CARLISLE that he  insulted the fishes  by saving me and then walked away growling like a lionPoor CARLISLE seemed to be sadly out of spirits and when he had rescued me bowed with his wonted  elegance as if I had done  him  the favour and walked dejectedly away  Such HEATHCOATE has been

the the penCARLISLE still avoids me most assiduouslyyet it is a generous sentiment of  his  that has reduced me to the state in which I have for some time been involved My father has been several times on the point of making particular enquiries but so great a simpleton am I that whenever he takes hold of my hand and begins to press it to his bosom I tremble from head to foot and he is deterred from speaking I am certain  my heart will break if an alteration does not soon take place  Medway  has again this minute been aiming his moonstruck mysteries at me Coming out of my chamber I

about to  pull  the fruit which was makebelieve ripening for our tool Sir ANDREW and I am in the utmost confusionTo crown the whole I have reason to think that cursed letter of CARLISLE's got safe to hand while mine miscarriedfor within  this  hour I have noticed two strange muffled up  fellows walking backwards and forwards within sight of my diningroom windowsPerhaps the Marquis himself may be in town and according to his Italian custom these may be his desperadoes who will dog me to my destiny I am all terror  for  I am all guiltHave  you  a bed to spare if I could escape to your

after me  "Punctual as lovers to the moment sworn" said IWell charming pupil are you now convinced that  I am convinced said she Sir ANDREW that you ought to be contented with the many innocent freedoms I  allow without pressing me to grant any thing criminal  Fie child when shall I persuade thee to throw off entirely all those HelterSkelterHall ideas Believe me women of true taste and fashion are above such grovelling homespun notionsPleasure is the word with persons that are truly polite and the pleasures I speak of are the most indispensible Take my word for it you can only be a better sort of Plebeian unless you admit of themCommence then I implore you the true woman of the  ton  at once and make your Sir ANDREW happyNay then if you refuse me I must take the fashionable

her again  She threw me from her and gave a shriekBut what of thatto make the matter ten times more terrible her exclaiming arroused the ear of the pensive  Carlisle  who was sitting not far off Never

well  concerted Must you violate the laws of hospitality at the very time that you seduce simplicityFie upon itI am not one Sir ANDREW who pique myself upon breaking in upon the private revellings of the libertine but the ground you  now  tread upon is consecrated by belonging to  your friend  If that Sir has no weight with you I must add something to its force by informing you that it is the

departure I sat a little while under the agony of being the subject of my own ridicule Annihilation just  then would have been a blessing and I sneaked into the house at last as melancholy a mite as even crawled upon the earth To finish the matter CARLISLE treated me at supper as if nothing had happened  Adieu  A FLIGHT  LETTER LXXX Mr LASCELLES to Mr HEATHCOATE  THE fellows that hovered over my house have disappeared and I take up the pen again in more quiet to speak upon the subject of the runaway Marchioness Ah what a line of success was I in if my cursed passion had not made it crookedBut there was no possibility of resisting the temptationI saw the lovely creature in so many different positionsThis moment she dropt upon her knee to call blessings on her CARLISLEthe next she sprung up and execrated her fatal partiality 'Twas in vain under such circumstances to attack her in  my  own  person She looked she lovedshe existed only in CARLISLE What was to be done  Stratagem  assisted I counterfeited the hand of CARLISLEmade in his name a solemn appointment to meet her  with Mr Lascelles' permission  Enjoined a sacred league of reciprocal silence during the midnight visitwas punctual to the assignationassumed the murmurs of CARLISLE'S mellifluous voice and was received with raptureFelicity was before me  but  I was interrupted even at this very moment just as the heaven of beauty was in prospect it was contrived by some demon that detests me to occasion a  stumble  as I was stepping along the apartment By appointment no lights were to be admittedbut this unfortunate stroke soon introduced  one  and it was brought in the hand of my very sister The Marchioness was fixed  in astonishmentI knew not which way to stirThe rest is too painful to repeatWe left AUGUSTA in her chamber but about an hour after we were departed my sister to weep and I to curse myself I heard somebody go softly down stairs and presently tampering at the bars of the streetdoor I followed the impulse of my suspicions and hurried down alsoYou are not to be told it was the MarchionessI besought her to returnWithout condescending to reply she proceeded in her efforts upon my interfereing a second time she exclaimed in a voice that at once terrified and commanded me"Villain set me at liberty"I was fool and idiot enough to  obey  her She rushed into the street like lightning and being habited in her boy's apparel ran along unsuspected  CAROLINE does nothing but upbraid One thing is the Marchioness has no idea of CARLISLE's addressAt all events I must weather it outPerhaps all may again be wellWhatever folly you commit let not the cursed lusts of the flesh get the better of your policy  Adieu Adieu  GEORGE LASCELLES  LETTER LXXXI Captain CARLISLE to Mr LASCELLES  HOW is it that

This fallacious piece of wickedness under the appearance of tenderness was delivered as usual by the execrable LASCELLESto what end do you think Ah my dear Signora it is too shocking for your fancy ever to conjecture it With a blush I tell you that on  my  part  for oh Signora I loved to deaththe moment of assignation was expected with unutterable impatience It was observed  The apartment was darkuniversal tremor shook every nerve as I heard the step approach meBut the foot in advancing encountered a chairSure it was placed there by Providence to produce the alarm which discovered to me  I am overwhelmed in tears which discovered the villany of  Lascelles  and  Carlisle  Yes Viola CARLISLE the great the elegant the virtuousseeming CARLISLECARLISLE degenerated to a mere panderan ordinary wretch who had agreed to sacrifice the woman that adored himsacrifice her to the man with whom he placed her  for protectionBut this is not half his basenessthis was not an enormity of sufficient magnitude for the illustrious CARLISLE When LASCELLES left the room while I was hurrying on my boy's apparel resolved to escape I felt under my feet some papers which my good genius directed me to take up I got safe from the detested house and wandered a solitary wretch in the streets I knew not whither It could not yet be past two o'clock in the morning and the watchmen who are always abroad till after that hour were still upon their guard As there are lamps disposed through all the parts of this city I stood under one of them to examine my papers which I judge must have fallen from

which I  purposely wrote forged  and  dropt  in AUGUSTA's apartment arebeyond my expectation as she went away in the night pickt up As she knows not CARLISLE's address in the country and is I believe without much moneyshe may be tempted to return On the other hand if these scheming papers have fallen into my sister CAROLINE's possession it is worse still However at all events I take care no letters shall go  out  or come  into  my house without my knowledge Yet I suspect that CAROLINE receives letters left for her at some other placeI know not what to think The cursed uncertainty too of

very farthermost end of the room and in the softest whisper told me thatO misery Mr LASCELLEShe should have the ring upon LUCIA's finger in less than three days "Hushhushsaid he 'tis the greatest in the worldthe poor girl is quite sick upon my delayShe chides me with her looks every time I see her I cannot even have leisure enough to put to death the uncle and nephew  They must live till the beginning of the weekPray pardon me for that my dear friend  One  would have  sunk  if you could but have let him alone Poor LUCIA longer delay would certainly kill herThree days has she already kept her chamberMum MumNo noiseI have the thing that will settle the business in my pocket"  This conversation was like all his discourse in set solemn sentencesMr DE GREY with an air of sadness upon his venerable brow came into the room and we parted  Oh LASCELLES help me to languagehelp me to sentiments which describe sensations of horror that I may transmit to you some idea of the feeling that took hold of my heart when  I beheld MEDWAY put as if by stealth into the hand of Mr DE GREY a paper that seemed to be stampt with several sealsThough it was too much like a  letter  and too  small  to be a settlement yet my fancy suggested it was some  deed  sufficient to  my  destruction  Had not water been at hand I should certainly have dropt  To swell the circumstance both the HEWSONS and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT were in the room  This was not all Mr DE GREY seemed to receive the packet with pleasure and retired rather abrupter than he was wont to do when he leaves a company  MEDWAY hummed a love sonnet and capered about the room passing by me every now and then with a wink  The trial was too hard to be supported I withdrew What was to be done It was plain that Sir ANDREW's affair was out of the question  MedwayMedway only  was the man For  Medway  the cruelah why do I call her cruelthe  charming  LUCIA DE GREY was now languishing in her chamber for  him  she had been long indisposed  his  image it was that filled her thoughts  his  person it was that charmed her eyes  he  only wasto to  I lost my senses LASCELLESand I now lose them again at the recollection of what followed these reflections  LUCIA DE GREY herself appeared She came tottering from her apartment with a countenance which although ever lovely denoted infinite emotion  Oh Mr CARLISLE said she lifting up both her hands what is doing above in the library  Doing my dear Miss DE GREY replied I as we walked into the garden whither she was going to air you frighten mewhy  what is  doing  Ceremony  said she in the

her on flame An old friendungenerous to an  old  friendTo be sure I have known Mr MEDWAY some timeI haveBut why do I argue upon the subjectEvery moment makes my disappointment more manifestWhy then am I perplexing my heart with constant attempts to explain  what  if I was not wilfully blinded is as clear as the light of Heaven The only wise partthe only  possible  part for me now to act is directly

sort of offence but on the contrary feeling for you the same warmth of friendship as usual I am not a little surprised at the turn and colouring of the sentiment in your last letter I have now puzzled over it a great while without being in any measure rewarded for my pains To speak the whole truth I do not comprehend one sentence of your whole favour You seem to be agitated and desirous of performing certain ceremonies with peculiar privacy at a very early hour of the morning and yet I cannot conceive  of what nature those ceremonies should be nor if they are of an hostile complexion can I suggest to myself whence they should happen I beg you will be so friendly as to  explain  this matter If you can point out to me any circumstance that to your eye looks like an impropriety no man will be more willing to be instructed how it may be  amended  If it should prove that you are yourself mistaken no man will more chearfully impute it to that origin from whence many similar errors have proceeded namely from excessive  sensibility  I am my dear MEDWAY Your obedient servant ROBERT DE GREY  LETTER XCII Mr MEDWAY to Mr DE GREY  SIR  Ho hois that the case You don't choose to

friend not quite so well in my health I impute it to the recent alteration of climate A little excursion may possibly assist me and therefore I propose to set out tomorrow morning to my town house and so back again  But as it is possible my dear Sir some  changes  may happen in your family before my return I will with  your  leave joined to that of Mr MEDWAY who I understand is now closeted with you make bold to pay my parting  devoir  in your presenceto Miss DE GREY Perhaps Sir it is decreed that I am never more to salute her under that appellation Nothing however can happen that can violate the heartfelt esteem with which  I am My dear Sir Your most affectionate servant CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER XCVIII Mr LASCELLES to Mr HEATHCOATE  JOY joy HEATHCOATEII I have recovered my lost treasurerecovered her though by compulsionI caught her upon the lookout for Captain CARLISLE and as good luck would have it scarce ten minutes before old limping GEOFERY the Captain's favourite footman  arrived  with a letter from his masterI am ready to leap out of my skin though as to the Lady herself never did I see such a dreadful alteration her visage pale her eyes dim her air languidShe scarce seems to have taken refreshment since her  escapeThough my sister kneels down and presses her with tears to eat she most obstinately refuses What a violent woman I gave it out to two fellows whom I had upon the scout that she was a relation of mine hurt in her senses who had broke from us Her behaviour to them on being seized justified this for in getting her up stairs to her old apartment she took a little pocketknife from her side and aimed it with full force at one of the men's throats I own I am sorry to see her in this situation though I had rather have her  any way  than have her to  look for  CARLISLE would certainly have taken vengeance  Now  all may be well again I am glad to see my sister behave so prudently to AUGUSTA In a day or two I shall send you better news about her If I ever again run the  risque of gratifying my  passion  at the price of my  policy  then execrate  Your old unfortunate G LASCELLES  P S  I am going down on Wednesday to fight for  five hundred pounds  OLLY MEDWAY is to be the  mark  The money you may be sure is to be for ANDREW'S FRIENDS The  Fame  he may put into his pocket if he pleases 'Tis to be within half a mile of Prudence Placeyet shall I not be seen I shall fire my pistol and come away again directly As to my  exit  that is out of the question I am shotfree  LETTER XCIX  Captain CARLISLE to Mr LASCELLES  THE strangest as well as the most sudden alteration has happened in the affairs at Prudence Place that you can possibly imagine Oh my LASCELLES I am lighter than the airthe dead weight is taken from my bosom I have neither a thorn in my heart nor a wrinkle on my brow Though the path that led to this paradise was not without brambles that  obstructed  it presented at  last  the smoothest the most lawny as well as the most rosy prospect in the world  You shall hear  Unable any longer to bear the increasing perplexities of my situation I wrote a letter of excuse to Mr DE GREY for a week's absence and went to pay my farewell respects to LUCIA  Suggesting what might be the state of my feelings at the close of such an interview I took care to have my carriage waiting for me at the door the moment I left her apartmentnor did I even  allow  myself this pleasure of entering her apartment at all till I had preinvited  Mr De Grey  to be present and even till I had  apprized Mr Medway  of the sole purpose of my visit  I meant only to makemy  heart ach  and withdrawOh human nature  Mr DE GREY opened the door to me he had scarce entered himself Behind him stoodMEDWAY making his salutations to LUCIA who upon seeing me advance put on as of late had been usual a sort of  anxiousness  which I have been but too apt to construe in my  disfavour  LUCIA DE GREY looked as if she thought it a  strange meeting  "Pray sit down gentlemen" said she in a fluttering manner"Pray sit down"  Her father took her by the hand I was preparing to speak on the subject of my departurebut could for the soul of me get no farther than"I am come MadamI am come Miss DE GREYI amI am come"  "Very true Captain" replied Mr DE GREY taking me up briskly "you are come extremely aproposyou are come just in time to be a witness to"  Oh LASCELLES my perverting fancy caught at the only wrong construction of the sentiment and I interrupted him by exclaiming  "Excuse me my dear Mr DE GREYpray excuse meI would dedicate not only my leisure but my life to the wishes of your familybut to be a  witness  to be a  witness  my good Sir upon so interesting an occasion isisisindeed I could not be of any service"  "Service Mr CARLISLE" said MEDWAY"there is no service in the casethe only service you can be of in  promoting the design of our visit to this young Lady is to be a witness that I have had all the reason in the world to suppose I was beloved by her"  "Was it ever questioned Mr MEDWAY" said I  "Questioned"retorted Miss DE GREY"questioned Mr CARLISLE beloved by meMr MEDWAY beloved by me"  "  Yes  Madam  I  "said MEDWAY  "Now then we come to the point" replied Mr DE GREY  "Perhaps these explanations" said I "may be improper before meI certainly intrudeFamily affairs are  sacredI beg permission to withdraw Had I known you were upon business of so much delicacy"  "Stay Mr CARLISLE" answered LUCIA with more firmness than is usual to such extreme delicacy as her's "it is a justice you  owe me  to stay SirWith regard to  you  Mr MEDWAY I beg to know upon what misconstruction you found the astonishing fact you charge me with"  "  Astonishing  fact Madam" rejoined MEDWAY"Is it not clear have I not fed my fond heart with this idea many monthsdid you not always meet me with a smilehave I not a thousand times said that you was made to be the best wife in the worldhave I not been ready to murder any man that should dare to look stedfastly at  you Has not your father heard me declare that I would lose my blood in your service"  Here LUCIA lifted up her hands again  "I grant all this my dear MEDWAY" said Mr DE GREY "but surely this is no foundation for a passion LUCIA smiles whenever she meets any of her friends It is a complacency that belongs to her characterit belongs even to her face her features are made for giving welcome to her father's friends  Such  Mr MEDWAY most certainly  is  "  "Lookee Mr DE GREY" replied MEDWAY"hush hush no noise about this businessI am no talker I have been intending to make your  daughter my wife a long while I thought both you and she knew plain enough my meaning especially as I was exceeding cautious least it should be known to any body elsewhich I despise I took the affair for granted It seems I am deceived Nobody understood my meaning but myselfThe business is easily brought to an issue Here's the upshot Do you now Mr DE GREY approve of my beginning more explicit overtures"  "That question" said Mr DE GREY "is first to be submitted to my daughter You are a worthy man and I here declare I have no objection to  any  gentleman upon whom I have any solid reasons to believe  she  places her affections"  "Give me your hand" cried MEDWAY "you speak fairlyI love honour better than lifelifeit  is  MY heaven Well Miss LUCIA now is the time Every thing rests with you"  Guess if you can LASCELLES what I underwent at this moment My heart was at my lips  "Since it is incumbent on me to speak" said the beautiful trembler "I must confess that though there is no man I more esteem than Mr MEDWAY as a  friend  yet yet in the light of ofa  lover  IIcannot say that thatPray be not displeased with me if I say that"  "Enough said enough saidhush hushI'm only angry" said MEDWAY  "that you did not tell me so before butno noiseI see it was partly my own fault Give me a bussyou are a good girla bad one at a  hint  tho' hushhushyou are a bad one at a hint Give me your hand Mr DE GREY I thought I was acting the right partBut I am too old and too odd a fellow to die of disappointment so all I have farther to say on the subject is this don't speak of my affair below Let us separateLet us go down a little  after  one anotherWho's the wiser who's the wiser"  "Another moment if you please" said Mr DE GREY rising and advancing to LUCIA whom in the course of the conversation he had left"Since matters have gone thus far and we are all friends together tell me LUCIA  if you think there is any  other  person who may be going on in the same  mistake  If so we may rectify it in time Do you imagine any other in  this family  for instance lays claim to your tenderness my dear"  My God LASCELLES what a question  "No indeed Sir" answered LUCIA with a sigh  "Oh yes" rejoined MEDWAY "that bit of a Baronet Sir ANDREW FLIGHT"  "Sir ANDREW FLIGHT" cried she hastily"the matter was not  improbable  with so  worthy  a man as Mr MEDWAY but surely Sir ANDREW FLIGHT could never"  "Madam" returned MEDWAY "I was about to have jerked him into a fish pond upon that account If you have ever any thing to say to such a fellow as that I'll never forgive you"  "Perhaps it may be in  your  power Mr CARLISLE" said Mr DE GREY coming round to me "to help us to another upon the lover's list"  Think of my confusion LASCELLES after great hesitation I spoke as follows while LUCIA went first to one window then to the other as if taking different views of the garden  "I must own Sir it does not seem difficult for me to mention another of Miss DE GREY's admirers The difficulty would be in finding a person of  her acquaintance who did  not  come under that character"  "Come come CARLISLE no noise no noise" said MEDWAY "you have  yourself  been her admirer any time these"  Here LUCIA turned round with a face blooming with a thousand blushes  "Mr CARLISLE  my  admirer Mr MEDWAY"  "Yes Miss DE GREY Mr CARLISLE has to my knowledge been your admirer before he went to Italy You may thank mefor now I see the whole train of my mistakethat he has pined and grieved and"  "For heaven's sake Mr MEDWAY" said LUCIA  "CLEMENT" said Mr DE GREY "MEDWAY is too hard upon you he has had a slight scratch of the passion himself and he wants to make us believe you have had a wound too But come Mr MEDWAY I have something to shew you in the librarysuch a fishingpole as perhaps you never saw"  They both went out of the room handinhand LUCIA attempted to follow  "And  must  you go then Miss DE GREY" said I  "Go"  replied she turning"lord why not Mr CARLISLEI am going to see the fishingpole"  "What a blessing I should have deemed it Miss DE GREY if this discovery had been made before I went to Italy"  "What did you say Mr CARLISLEItalyGood GodHas your Italian attractions then"  "O LUCIALUCIA I can hold no longerToo longtoo long already hath a sense of honour and a religious regard to what I all the time thought  your happiness  kept me silentfor this I bleedfor this I was in despair for this too it was that I was again preparing to departButtruth requires no longer sacrifice My feelings may now again shew themselvesAgain may I adore those charming eyesagain You are not angry with me LUCIA"  "Angry with youCLEMENT"  "Dear generous LUCIA DE GREY This hand must bear the impression of my gratitude"  "Pshawnonsensehow  can  you CARLISLE but you were departing whither would you go CARLISLE"  "I had forgot that my chaise is at the door LUCIA"  "And must you go then CLEMENT"  "  Go  my adorable LUCIA yes I must go this momentI must go as fast as my feet can carry me toorder my horses to be put into Mr DE GREY's stable"  "How soon you men alter your minds  Clement  "  "Ah LUCIA LUCIA I am now possessing one of the happiest moments of my life"  "I am myself not  miserable  CARLISLEand and and so take my hand and"  "Do with it what I please"  For the first time since my return I not only kissed  that  LASCELLES but ravished a rapture upon her rosy lip Here is an end of my conversationletter  I shall  not  come to townmy horses are turned to grassLove is likely to allow them a long feast of pasturage I cannot tell you how light I feel at the  heartBut let me not in my ecstasy forget my friend The cash which I designed to bring  myself  I now remit a draft for I beg you will ever continue to command on all sorts of occasion the services of  Your's CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER C Mr LASCELLES to Mr HEATHCOATE  A MISERY and a misfortune more extreme than before hath fallen upon meThe Marquis is come The Marchioness is every thing but absolutely distractedMy sister is overwhelmed in tears I am plunging in the abyss of despair My whole family is in ruins  A violent thundering at my door last night and almost towards the zenith of it announced the impatience of somebody who had authority to disturb us  Ah HEATHCOATE conscious guilt at that moment emasculated my usual hardihood I felt my heart convulsing in my bosom and the shameful drops of  fear  were upon my brow Flying then from my bed wrapt up only in a  robe de chambre  I charged my servants to deny megave my sister the like injunction and then stole with inglorious terror into a kind of lumberroom at the top of the house that I might escape even the  voice  of my accuser To this precaution probably am I indebted for my lifeWho HEATHCOATE can  expect  to conquer the man whom he has  wronged  For money I am mercenary enough to fight but with the weight of  crimes  upon the heart one's intrepidity hath no room to play  The knocking being for some time repeated and every repetition with more vehemence admittance was at length given  Oh these highspirited foreigners No sooner was he entered than he demanded in a tone of implicit command his violated wife He did not it seems wait any reply He did not wait even long enough for obedience In disregard of every thing that looked like ceremony he flew up stairsrushed from one room to another and found at last the object of his search I heard the shriek of the Marchioness's amazement even to the remotest corner of my hiding hole Barbarous man abandoned woman reechoed thro' the cave I was witness to the clamourous denunciation  of death upon CARLISLE and myself I was witness that the Marquis was in possession of CARLISLE's address the name of DE GREY and even of LUCIA were articulated with curses of vengeanceWith execrations still stronger was all future connexion with the Marchioness renounced and he rushed down the staircase at last swearing never more to close his eyes till his revenge as far as it could be had in  this  world that was his expression was compleat  Since his departure I have crept from my sanctuary and tried but not without tremor to gain admittance to the apartment of AUGUSTA She has drawn a triple bolt across the door She will not speakMy sister is on the  bed of sickness O TRUTH what a DEITY art THOUthy smile might chace away despair But what are these reflections to the pusillanimous and false  G LASCELLES  LETTER CI From the Marquis of N to Miss DE GREY  MADAM  DO a stranger the honour to deliver the inclosed after you have yourself read it to the greatest and most accomplished villain upon earth I take this mode of getting my letter to his hand that you whom I presume to be young and innocent may if not too late escape the wrongs that are heaped upon the head of  The Marquis of N  The inclosed to Captain CARLISLE  SIR  AS  cowardice  is not I hope amongst the number of your vices I send you this honourable warning that I shall be within ten paces of Prudence Place at twelve o'clock  this  night to pay you a double debt the first in nature of a money obligation the second in recompence for having debauched the  wife of a friend  Your conduct would warrant assassination but I scorn it  The Marquis of N  P S  I have no design to rob you of the Marchioness She is sighing for you  where

long line of mysteries is unravelled Yes my friend the cause of your poor LUCIA's anxiety is now no longer problematical Alas it is made but too manifest So there IS an Italian attachment I find after all the warm heart of Captain CARLISLE could not it seems remain insensible of beauty blooming under so bright a sun Nay his passion to do him justice is of the most fashionable kind A  wife  has been his object to give him greater eclatthe wife of his  friend    Oh Miss LASCELLES I have not patience to go onOh that I could findthat I could but have a single glance of this allaccomplished Marchioness of N  That  is his dulcinea She must be  very  handsomeshe must certainly surpass all the ladies on this side the lineHeavens Miss LASCELLES what an angel she must be  I  must be abut why do I talk of such a deformity as myself The superior charms of the MarchionessOh Miss LASCELLES that I could see her  But from whom do you suppose I received this illustrious intelligence even from the injured husband himself The letter of the Marquis is at this minute before me My eye even now fixes upon that part of the epistle where  Oh Miss LASCELLES however merited the vengeance which I now perceive hanging over the head of CARLISLE his life is still precious to me and I must make an effort at least to prevent the mischiefI thought him my friend the very  Tutor of Truth  instead of which I behold him the Preceptor of Infamyyetfor his  life  let it be preserved that he may  mend  it  What measure shall I take There is no time for choice or deliberation a few hours only are between Captain CARLISLE and Death Death DeathOh Miss LASCELLES I am distracted  LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CIII Captain CARLISLE to G LASCELLES Esquire  Sent previous to his knowledge of the Marquis's arrival  SUCH is my joy since this happy alteration in the posture of affairs at Prudence Place my LASCELLES that it is impossible for me to leave it again till the loveliest of women is firmly and irrevocably mine I have fixed in  my  mind Saturday next for that blessed change in my condition against which time I could wish to present the lovely LUCIA DE GREY with certain little elegancies that might shew  my attention  though they can never add any thing  to the graces of  her person  Do  you  then my friend be my agent upon this occasion Let  your  taste be consulted and give  mine  the credit of it I inclose you an order for five thousand pounds and I recommend you by a line to a person who hath a better  mechanical  knowledge than you or I of the true water and intrinsic excellence of diamonds This business must be done immediately and you are not to forget that in doing it you oblige LUCIA DE GREY at the time you oblige  CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER CIV Miss LUCIA DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  WHO CAROLINE can say unto misery thus far shalt thou go and no farther I am more compleatly a wretch than ever  Soon after I had sent away my last CARLISLE came to pay me the compliments of the day He paid them with the best dissembled tenderness you ever saw He congratulated his heart upon the return of its tranquillityHe took my hand and carried it with a zeal  which any woman might have taken for real to his lips He even talked with blooming cheeks upon the day of marriage he pretended that he suffered unutterable things by delay He said he should never be happy till I was his He absolutely carried the cruel joke so far as to assert he had commissioned your brother to purchase decorations for the joyful day  This seemed a proper opportunity to draw up the curtain and discover the first scene of his farce Oh what a dialogue  "I think Mr CARLISLE you wrote some letters to my father from the house of a Marquis of N during your residence at Rome"  "I did MadamI did my dear LUCIA"  "You spoke I think occasionally of the Marchioness his Lady"  "I did She is a charming woman Except LUCIA DE GREY I never saw a lovelier"  "'Pshaw your exception is a flattery Is she sensible"  "She is beyond imagination"  "You were upon very good terms no doubt"  "The best in the world I have sat the whole evening conversing with her upon subjects even of science"  "A  learned  Lady then"  "Rather  accomplished  than learned she wants however that gentleness which distinguishes the lovely LUCIA DE GREY"  "You left her certainly with regret"  "Had it not been for LUCIA DE GREY whom I fondly expected to see it might have been so"  "Is she still at Rome Captain CARLISLE"  "I fancy not LUCIA The Marquis visits in Rome but his home is Paris Though the Marchioness herself is a native of England and I had the pleasure to revive her acquaintance  with her own language so much that she now speaks it as fluently as the French and Italian"  "Those were agreeable  teteatetes  Pray did she never express any desire to see her native country"  "Oh oftenalmost every hour"  "Was it not incumbent on your politeness CLEMENT to offer them a"  "I did but the Marquis was obliged to take a journey to the interior part of Italy"  "The Marchioness accompanied him him no doubt"  "No she was ill at that time with a cold and did not go with the Marquis"  "I protest I should not have been surprized if she had in such an absence played truant and come over to her native country with you CLEMENT"  "With meLUCIAcome over with meWhy that you know would have beenaa"  "Like a woman of spirit that is all I dare say now CLEMENT if you would but confess this  has  been the case"  "How can you think sowhat reason in nature have youtoto  "Why not much reason indeed but a billet which I received this morning mentions a Lady that in some degree allowing for the alteration as Mr HENRY HEWSON says answers the description of the Marchioness"  "May Imay I beg permission to peruse your billet LUCIAIs it from"  "'Tis from a quite new correspondent and bytheby there is a small inclosure for you Here are both"  I gave him Miss LASCELLES the Marquis's letter  "It is very true Miss DE GREY" said he without any emotion after reading them "that the Marchioness is at present under my protection and  it is true also that she came to England though not with me very soon after me"  "Is it then the Marquis is not angry without cause"  "It is a painful circumstance to relate my dear LUCIA though there is no guilt on either side You will excuse me on the subject I beg you will for a few hours keep the matter from Mr DE GREY and all the rest of the family I shall certainly wait upon the Marquis and accommodate every thing She is still worthy of his affection"  Did you ever CAROLINE see  guilt confessed  carried with so high a hand He is so habituated I suppose to crimes of this nature in his Italian connexions that he thinks nothing of it 'Tis in  his notion I dare say an innocent freedom and not seduction Was there ever so composed a libertine He has just made his bow without any other sort of disorder and walked offLet him fight CAROLINE let him fallI hate the sight of himIII oh my God my God what a wretch I am  LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CV From the Same to the Same  AH CAROLINE CAROLINE I renounced the barbarous reflection I shuddered at the horrid idea of CLEMENT CARLISLE's death This moment have I sent the inclosed to that ungenerous man I wait the issue with anguish inexpressible  Adieu Adieu  The Inclosed  From Miss DE GREY to Captain CARLISLE  SIR  I CONJURE you to preserve your life or at least not to risque the loss of it Do not meet the Marquis Ah what have I said Have I recommended cowardice to mytoto Mr CARLISLE Yet what can courage do to the man of conscious guilt it can at best only aggravate guilt by precipitating death to the man who is already wronged I charge you to  toI know not what to say to you Captain CARLISLE You have murdered the peace of the unhappy  LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CVI From the Same to the Same  HE  will  go Miss LASCELLESHe talks with firmness and the coolest fortitude of his innocence He even accuses me of an unkind suspicion He hath that  philosophy  of assurance if I may so call it to confront conviction Yet I am cheared at the ideaAh if it should  indeed  be possible for his avowed innocence to appearif it should indeed be possible  Alas it is  not  possible Is she not  under his protection  Is she not the handsomest woman in  Italy  Is not  her husband at hand to take vengeance on the seducer  But yet who knows what softening circumstances may at length turn out on the side of Mr CARLISLEIn the mean time he may perhaps fall a victim to appearancesOh what agony besets me on either sideWhy CAROLINE do you not write to the wretched  LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CVII From the Same to the Same  IT strikes ten o'clockWe have just risen from supper CARLISLE did the honours of the table my father choosing to sup in his room with as much grace and composure as ever He was neither more dejected nor elated than usual and he behaved to me as if an upbraiding sentiment had never past between us He was dressed in his new regimentalsHis Colonel's commission is come down I think I never saw him look so lovelyHe says it seems awkward to be called Colonel  Surely he musthe  must  be innocent and if he  is  O Heavens he is gone out of his room I heard his door shutExcuse me CAROLINE I must not lose sight of him If he goes I have a foreboding that he will fall What then remains for your

resolution peculiarly her own I was alarmed even for her life and her death would at this conjuncture of affairs be the most unseasonable thing that could possibly happen This apprehension is removed by the receipt of the inclosed billetYou will  there  see the terms upon which she requested CARLISLE's direction You will see too that it  would have been impolitic in me under such circumstances and especially as she must be too feeble to stir abroad to stand out with her Besides this I have her  under guard  the trusty MARYANNE will not suffer a second escape The Marchioness seems much more composed She does not beat her beautiful bosom she does not loudly lament her fate as before the maid is this moment passing my room in her way to the apartment of my poor sick CAROLINE with assurances of AUGUSTA's tranquillityThus far therefore there is a treaty betwixt me and agony But this is only guarding against the enemy in one quarter while one is more open to his attack in another

Marchioness will be quite easy and will submit with the greatest patience to her confinement if Mr LASCELLES will give her some such written testimony as may be convincing that the person of CARLISLE is not in imminent dangerIf it  is  in danger the Marchioness will never more during her whole life complain if Mr LASCELLES will warn that gentleman of his real situation by forwarding the card inclosed by a special courier  AUGUSTA N  To Captain CARLISLE  SIR  ONE whom it seems you  detest  and who is in your opinion a  wanton  takes this method of informing you that while you continue in England your  life  is at a hazard from the Marquis of N As you value that therefore go immediately to some place of safety where you are not the object of an assassin You will think I am sincere in this counsel when I further inform you that the  chamber  of AUGUSTA would be the only part of the world where the tenderness of that foolish wanton dare not now wish you  AUGUSTA N***  LETTER CIX Mr

horrid scene of rencontre  I am resolved to pursue him let the consequence be what it will  Your L D G  LETTER CXII From the Same to the Same  NEVER surely Miss LASCELLES was any scene so complicated with horrors and surprises as that to which I have just been a witness I write now in the deepest distress and write now in the deepest distress and in a house of general mourning In the first place Miss LASCELLES your brother is no morethe fair but unhappy occasion of his death is also near her end and the husband is almost distracted Ah my CAROLINE how I tremble  But it is necessary for me however painful to proceed to the minutest of this horrid business  I traced Mr CARLISLE unobserved till he came within view of the spot I heard somebody advance from behind a tree It was the Marquis of N *** It was too late to discover myself or to hope any thing from entreaties They joined and walked together I went tremblingly behind CARLISLE told the whole history of the unfortunate AUGUSTA He attributed the whole to frolic he protested that she was still under the most sacred protection at the house of Mr LASCELLES in London He pleaded a thousand apologies Pledged himself for her fidelity The Marquis would scarce suffer him to finish a single sentence without interruption he is the most headstrong man in the world he execrated CARLISLE as a  seducer  he even reprobated him as a  coward  He infisted upon taking his life if it was not  immediately defended He strode onward to measure the ground  "A little farther  on  then Sir" said he to the Marquis "this is not a proper place for our in my opinion very unnecessary business Behind yonder house is a heath the clash of our weapons will not there be heard"  I was ready to expire my dearest Miss LASCELLES at every step and with very great difficulty escaped observation  "If it  must  be so Sir" continued CARLISLE "this is the spot"  At this moment Miss LASCELLES we heard a confused murmur of voices The sounds came from the other side of a small plantation of firs  "Stop Sir" cried the Marquis "no witnessesall fair play if you please I do not mean to assassinate  you Carlisle  nor shall you assassinate me"  They both went on the other side of the plantationThe moon shot forth her ray at the very instant of entering and as if Providence designed it so her beams were beyond comparison bright Oh earth and heaven what a scene was opened upon us from removing this curtain of darkness  In one part we beheld the persons of Mr MEDWAY and Mr LASCELLES as it proved to be standing upon the defensive In another stood the figure of a  stripling  leaning pensively against a fir as if he were unengaged in the combat yet chose to be a spectator At a small  distance yet not sufficiently near to be distinguished for the persons they  really  were clustered another groupe as if they wished rather to see than to be seen  "Confusion" said MEDWAY "we are discovered If I knew by  whom  I would annihilate himHa" continued he looking in the face of his antagonist "by Heaven this is not Sir ANDREW FLIGHT"  "I am his  friend  Sir" said the other "and I choose to fight for him Curse on the moonbeams"  "Good God" cried CARLISLE by this time come near enough to recognize him "Is it my friend LASCELLES whom I behold"  "  Carlisle  " exclaimed Mr LASCELLES"Is it you"  "Come Sir" said the Marquis eagerly "no trifling my time is precious"  CARLISLE drew his sword  "Oh oh hush hush" said MEDWAY "softlyif that's the case no noise we are all come upon the same errand I find Advance then every man his bird and there's an end of it As to Sir ANDREW I will chastise him for  himself  and in the mean time as you think fit to represent him I will chastise you for meddling in the quarrels of a foolCome on Sir"  He fired his pistol in a moment Mr LASCELLES exchanged the salutationThey  were preparing again The Marquis and CARLISLE began to parry  Mr LASCELLES seeing this eagerly threw down his pistol  "Stop stop for Heaven's sake stop" said he to the Marquis"touch notlift not your arm against CARLISLE I charge youHere Sirhere into this bosom direct your vengeance 'Tis I Marquis I have been the cause of all your misfortune"  There was no time for expostulation Mr LASCELLES caught the sword from the hand of CARLISLE and insisted upon  first  engaging with the Marquis  CARLISLE was without arms MEDWAY hastened to arm him The Marquis  rushed upon him without regarding LASCELLES  LASCELLES again threw himself before CARLISLE and even pushed vigorously at the Marquis He was at length provoked to begin with your brother my dear Miss LASCELLES The very first thrust of the Marquis was fatal for the weapon passed thro' the side of Mr LASCELLES into his heart The Marquis received a wound also in exchange  Your brother had scarce fallen before the stripling whom the other objects had prevented from more notice and who had indeed retired farther off upon seeing us now came forward in a feeble manner and fell upon the ground almost at the feet of the Marquis  "Desist desist" said the poor thing in the most piercing tone in the world "desist from farther altercationHere lies at the point of all her wishes the unhappy cause of"  The sentence was left unfinished for the speaker of it fainted away  Oh Miss LASCELLES it was the Marchioness of N *** in disguise She had raised her own beautiful arm against her own charming bosom The point of a small sword was still sticking there  I ran to her relief  The Marquis stood fixed in horror but still looked sullen  MEDWAY was gone  CARLISLE was agonized by the most divided attention  The Marchioness appeared to be expiringShe requested to be carried to LASCELLES who was in the same situation  It is too hard a task for me Miss LASCELLES to recount to you the dreadful particulars of this pathetic scene It is incumbent upon me however to observe that such circumstances appeared on the part of your brother by his own dying confession that as it is impossible for his life to have been happy you will the less lament him  You  however my dear Miss LASCELLES he cleared from every imputation that might in consequence of  these discoveries have been thrown upon youHe confessed his errorhe bathed the lovely hand of poor AUGUSTA with his last tears He received her forgivenessAs for the Marchioness herselfOh Miss LASCELLESwords can give you no idea of her situation  She was tremblingly sensible to every thingShe looked tenderly at me and gave my hand to CARLISLE  She gave it as she lay bleeding before usWe conveyed her to Prudence Place Her husband is not even yet convinced of his cruelties yet she kissed his handShe wondered not she said at CARLISLE's preference  "Superior beauty added to superior virtue" said she taking my hand "might well conquer"  Ah CAROLINE how I felt this flatteryIt went through my very heart My father wept over herI never saw a house of so much miseryPoor CARLISLE'S condition was more touching than the restHe execrates himself as the innocent cause of allThe Marquis and he are now togetherThe Marquis seems not to regard his wound which is deeper than we imagined yet he is not so tender as he should be to AUGUSTA Your brother is laid on CARLISLE'S bedI saw him a little while since take his lifeless hand gently and turn away weeping  "Poor fellow" said he afterwards to me "the beauty of the temptation was greathis love of the dice may well account for  all  the rest I loved him muchLet his failings excite no  other terror than that of making us the wiser for his example  Here my CAROLINE is a prospect darkenedDo not believe I can rejoice under such circumstancesYour brother's corpse will beOh CAROLINE these are hard subjectsI must resign them to a firmer hand than that of the trembling  LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CXIII Mr MEDWAY to Sir ANDROW FLIGHT  SIR  THO' death hath been but too busy in this house within these few hours I cannot bear to have a trick put upon me without punishing the tricker You imposed upon me a stranger whom I might have sent to the shades without any right so to do But  you  are yet in the land of the living and I insist upon justice You sent a challenge with your own hand If you do not meet me this night by the way of hush  without any noise I will cane a coward all the way from Prudence Place to the Duke of Downderdale's  Hushyou comprehend me  O MEDWAY  LETTER CXIV Mr DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  Dear MADAM  THE tears that flowed from the eyes of LUCIA as she bade the servant carry a letter with your address to the post convince me how sincerely she joins me in deploring the unhappy circumstances of Mr LASCELLES'S death Yet what consolation can in these cases be offered to you Notwithstanding your brother's mistakes in other respects his  fraternal  affection might be very unblemished if so you will naturally  cast a veil of oblivion over such parts of his character as were concealed from you and his other friends and you must lament that part of the misfortune which deprives you of a tender relation LUCIA'S society however may assist your sense and smooth your path to that acquiescence which must be obtained Come therefore dear Madam amongst us or rather prepare yourself for such a journey It is not methinks adviseable to be here till after the present week Mr LASCELLES with his dying breath bequeathed his remains to CLEMENT CARLISLE He requested that the legacy might be accepted as a testimony of Mr CARLISLE'S forgiveness He will perform his duty to your satisfaction  Our situation is too painful at this crisis for me to proceed But let it  be considered for indeed the poet is right  Our only lesson is to learn to suffer  And he who knows not that was born for nothing  I am sincerely your's ROBERT DE GREY  LETTER CXV From Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  WHAT a peculiarity of disposition marks the Marquis of N*** Though his wound which he received from your brother is become more alarming he insisted upon being permitted to go into the apartment of the poor languishing AUGUSTA at a very unseasonable hour of the last night CARLISLE dissuaded him from this but soon after he again renewed the subject and was admitted  He shut to the door and spoke to his Lady in a very ungentle manner We were going to expostulate with him upon the impropriety of this conduct when he came out of the room and told us the Marchioness would be well enough to depart soonHe did not stay for any reply to this strange intelligence but ran down stairs into the saloon and from thence into the stable He insisted upon his horse on which under pretence of taking the air tho' he was scarce able to sit he rode away at full speed He disturbed us to enjoy this frolic in the middle of the night and he has not been heard of since Surely there never lived so singular a character  Alas the Marchioness is by no means in the recovering way the Marquis represented her Though her wound was  more promising at the last dressing her fever is rather increased than abated Yet she has never spoken disrespectfully of this strange husband since her illness She seemed much relieved however at the news of his being gone "Then" says she "I shall die in peace he will not come again to abuse me"  How pathetically my dear Miss LASCELLES am I concerned for the life of this lovely womanDo not believe I counterfeit I speak sincerely Her conduct has a larger apology in the treatment of so barbarous a husband Pray Heaven she may recover  Since I wrote this sentence I have been at her bedside and she cried out"Oh Miss DE GREY how good you areViolent as  I  have beenfor which I know you will forgive me  had I  known  Mr CARLISLE'S LUCIA before I am convinced my veneration for her would have cured me If I wish to recover Madam it is only to shew you my gratitude indeed it is"  Oh CAROLINE that she may live even though the Marquis is unworthy of her is the prayer of  Your LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CXVI Mr MEDWAY to Mr TOWNSEND  HERE'S pretty news for you A rascally Lord refuses to give me satisfaction and a villainous Baronet has writ me a challenge and run away without keeping his appointment He wanted moreover to have bilk'd me by a representative one LASCELLES who is killed by another hand just as he was going to attack me for a sum of money with a design to send me to the shades and make off with the price of killing me There have also several other strange things happened in this family of late There is a wounded Marquis gone just now bleeding  away and his wife is upon her as I think deathbed For this last matter I am much concerned as she is even now a most lovely young creature and I hate of all things that young handsome women should die though the Marquis her husband has no worthy quality belonging to him but his courage I choose to give up my pretensions to LUCIA I choose to give her to CARLISLE because she loves him I find better than me I choose to alter my will in her favour All these points are so many touches of my humour But as to this Baronet I must hunt him every where on this side Heaven till I have him upon his knees He made his escape ingloriously this morning and indeed lurked about the house like a scout with a pale face ever since the death of LASCELLES his bravado I will either  pink  him or  humble  him  TOWNSEND were he to take refuge under the hooppetticoat of his aunt DOWNDERDALE I will not be tricked Hushno noise My honour must be satisfied  another  way the opportunity is at hand I would not die with a debt upon my sword for the world Hush  O MEDWAY  LETTER CXVII From the Same to Mr GABRIEL HEWSON  SIR  YOU some time ago brought a letter of assignation from Sir A F who is gone off without either drawing his sword or firing his pistol Which of these do  you  choose He being gone the laws of honour require in my idea that you should represent himI must therefore have a shot or a stroke at youHush  OL MEDWAY  LETTER CXVIII From the same to T TOWNSEND Esq  SURELY TOWNSEND it is fated for me to be pestered with rascals I expected satisfaction from the cowardly  second  of the vile Sir A F and behold you I had no sooner intimated my design than  he  took to his heels also and sends me the sorry excuse I inclose to you  But by Heaven I will have them both on their knees yetHush  O MEDWAY  The Inclosed  From Mr GABRIEL HEWSON to Mr MEDWAY  SombreHedges  SIR  THE most superlative degree of astonishment seized me at the receipt of your letter As to Sir A F's epistle I knew not its contents and I do not find any law in my classic oracles Tully Tacitus and Pliny Junior not forgetting the goldenruled Epictetus which ordains the single combat to be fought by the carrier of a challenge  Besides this Sir my authors tell me such battles are criminal and that he who kills a man by the way of a duel sports with that eternity which he enters upon without his commission But you are a very fierce gentleman and if the sage Socrates himself was to tell you you were in the wrong I do not doubt but you would stigmatize the venerable seer as a coward  To avoid all these concussions of the soul and body and to fly from a scene which is no longer fit for a scholar's residence I have betaken myself away and send this immediately on my arrival at SombreHedges  If I have unwittingly offended Sir be assured that I implore a thousand pardons and that I may never offend again be satisfied also that I will no  more put my head into high places where the superior powers of the foodful earth are quarrelling in the face of day for want of other avocation  I am your's GABRIEL HEWSON  LETTER CXIX Mr MEDWAY to the Duke of DOWNDERDALE  MY LORD  YOUR nephew has run away When I thought of giving him the meeting I imagined him my equal that is to say I imagined him an honest man who is a prince's equal But within these few minutes I have found him very much  my  inferior and below my sword by beinga  villain  who not only hired a tool to fight for him but had condescended to lay plots for the  destruction  of the  sex  which he  ought to  protect  This therefore is written to acquaint him that I have for the future nothing to do with any part of him but his  nose  which I shall twist as nearly round as possible when I see him No noise Let him keep his secret and no greater harm will happen to him from the  supreme indignation  of  OLLY MEDWAY  LETTER CXX Mr MEDWAY to Mr GABRIEL HEWSON  SIR  COLONEL CARLISLE and Mr DE GREY have interceded with me to accept your apology you may therefore go safely to bed in SombreHedges with Pliny Junior although I have just heard you were bold enough to write a letter to  Lucia  upon a certain subject at a certain timeHushyou comprehend me However let that pass Read in a corner and keep at home for the future  You did me justice in supposing I would not take an affront from Socrates By Heaven I would not brook a wrong  look  from that Caesar who penned his own commentariesno not from Mars himself Never make a noise but let  Hush  be your motto  O MEDWAY  LETTER CXXI Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  NOT a word yet from the unaccountable Marquis although we wish very much to send him news of his wife's surprising change for the better By the care of our excellent physician and by her own previous happy state of health her wound is healed within a few days to every body's astonishment Her candid behaviour to me has engaged not only my attention but my tenderness She says she loves Mr CARLISLE now just as much as she ought to love an amiable  man who is to be the husband of her protectress  She never enquires after the Marquis  I am summoned Make yourself easy for Heaven's sake my CAROLINE This request is not more at the heart of your LUCIA than at that of the beautiful Marchioness who speaks of you with a warmth of gratitude peculiar to her Poor thing I hope we shall nurse her up yet  Your L DE GREY  LETTER CXXII From the Same to the Same  THE occasion of my being so soon called away from my writingdesk while I was last addressing my very dear CAROLINE was to be present at an interview betwixt my father and Mr and Mrs HEWSON  They desired a few minutes conversation with me and Mr DE GREY in the library They came handinhand They opened the design of their visit immediately  "Master DE GREY" said the husband "I am obliged to you for all favours but I have had enough of your high life so has HETT we have seen men killed women wounded friends fighting honest men's wives attempted to be '  bauched  and Lords taking pet without '  casion  So in a few words HETT and I have '  solved  to go back and live again at Skelter As to fine breedin we'l make that out as well as we can Better be  unp'lite  Master DE GREY than '  plite  enough to cut friend's throat and '  bauch  friend's wife so servant Master DE GREY and God be with you"  My father applauded this resolution and without any more ceremony they parted  They are this minute actually on their way to HelterSkelterHall  The Marchioness continues to improve ButsoftThere is a servant just dismounting from his horse whose sides give smoaking testimony of the rider's expedition  He is coming into the househis look and speed alarm me  In Continuation  Oh Heaven my CAROLINE the Marquis of N * * * is no more The messenger delivered a letter to the Marchioness which mentions his  death  The letter is from a relation of his in  London where he diedThe wound being neglected turned to a mortification and dispatched him in a few hoursThis obstinate man it seems shewed his resentment even upon his deathbed and bequeathed all his fortune to a distant branch of his family Not a single guinea to his LadyShe read the letter with very little emotion considering what is said to be his natural violence But she resolves to go directly to London feeble as she is and pay him the last duties She hazards the air too soon but she persists CARLISLE says she is deprived of every thing by this stroke but a scanty jointure I ventured to touch upon this She frankly said in answer that she had sufficient fortune in the loss of a cruel tyrannical husband  In Continuation  No intreaties can prevail upon the Marchioness to stay She declares she is well Her fever is indeed gone but the Doctor says she risques a relapse She has paid to my father and me her parting civilities They were terribly touching CAROLINE She suppressed a sigh as she gave her hand to CARLISLE but she recovered herself and with incredible resolution got into her chaise accompanied by Mr MEDWAY  Pray come down to us immediately With the different transitions from one affecting object to another I am quite fatigued I tremble for the MarchionessI feel for youI am unhappy to think it should be my fate to interfere  with the happiness of another woman Yet CLEMENT is too dear to be resigned and poor frail human nature will prevail  Hasten then to comfort the heart of  Your LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER CXXIII Miss LASCELLES to Miss DE GREY  I WAVE all remarks upon the dark passages of our late correspondence my dear Miss DE GREY nor will I admit any strokes of the deeplywounded heart

part  "A'cod" cries Geff Geehup "an I had been behind un I wou'd ha' lent un such a  sisseraro  that his hinder part should ha' remembered me till Candlemass"  But to make short of the story after a deal more merriment we closed the whole affair by giving boys a  bunfire  and what do you think we did dash my best buttons if we did not send little black bag tossicums florrididdles and all into the fire So here ends the affair of the  bettermost specie  If you take my advice GAB you'll do same Come and make merry with us As to our fortun there is more ways than one to the wood Let us help poor neighboursLet us buy bit o' land of one's ownLet us set fatherless he or she up in businessLet us put friendless  people in a wayIn short let us do any thing but be  p'lite  and good for nothing HETT says so too  Your ever loving brother HENRY HEWSON  LETTER CXXVI Sombre Hodges  Mr GABRIEL's Answer  I PERFECTLY approximate to my beloved brother's last sentiments I see plainly that a quiet corner and philosophical soul are the best of blessings HelterSkelterHall cannot be more dear to you than Sombre Hedges are to  him  who is thy tenderly fraternally affectionate friend I gave an entertainment last night without sixpence expence to better society that ever were seen at PrudencePlace if we except the Colonel his guardian and Miss DE GREY Who thinketh my brother  was at my banquet Even some of the greatest men of all antiquity Homer Horace Cicero and Seneca  Such  friends will I never more leave unless it is to visit my relations at HelterSkelterHall  I will suffer the sacred dust again to gather around my dwelling I will again nurse my frugal blaze and trim my decent lampI will once more plant the pensive yew the oak o'ershadowing and the willow grey Pensive pleasures shall again be mine and those who love the bustling of the world shall not if they are  pinch'd  want a protector Yes HENRY beloved HENRYI am now refixed for lifeMy old woman shed a tear at my returnmy cat rubb'd fondling her tabby sides against me and if it had  been possible my dog would have spoke my welcome  Again are you addressed by the dusky gentleman of Sombre Hedges who is resolved to play no more the truant  My  bag  and other instruments of my folly I shall not  burn  but I have fixed it in the deepest disgrace upon a peg opposite my study that it may ever be saying or seeming to say unto me Oh GABRIEL GABRIEL be contented with thy own hair and the best authors though thou wert to be tempted by bags of  gold  instead of silk  Adieu  GABRIEL HEWSON  LETTER CXXVII Mr MEDWAY to Colonel CARLISLE  Dated two months after his departure from PrudencePlace  Dear Colonel  I HAVE been the constant companion of this charming widow ever since we left your house There is something about her that attaches me to her but no circumstance so much as that she has lost her fortune and buried the fellow who deprived her of it decently I do not know how it is  but she has got a stronger hold of my heart than ever your LUCIA had The plague of it is I suspect she still likes youyet I struck a bold stroke yesterday  Mark it  "Hush hush AUGUSTA" said I "it is not to be expected that OLLY MEDWAY should please your eye after such a fineformed fellow as CLEMENT CARLISLE but he is engaged you knowWith respect to the Marquis no noise child about him He is not worth keeping terms of mourning with I despise the black custom of seeming to lament when one ought to jump for joyNow the case stands thus Can you behave well enough to OLLY MEDWAY not to call him at every  third word CLEMENT CARLISLE If you say you don't love the said CLEMENT I should hate you but can you take for a husband a man who loves him as much as  you  ought"  "I believe for  his  sake and Miss  De Grey's  " replied she sighing "I could"  "But what do you sigh for then"  "P'shawwill Mr MEDWAY comply with my terms"  "Name them"  "Will he reconduct me to the house of Signora at Italy"  "No noiseShall I order a chaise to the door"  "Yes"  "Hush"  Damn it CARLISLE she sigh'd  again  But what a poor reduced rascal I must be I like her well enough to take her any way  "You must excuse" said she "now and then a sighEven Miss DE GREY did not frown at me for that"  Confusion CARLISLE a tear which I caught upon my lip followed this  remark But what's a more childish trick still the water came running from my eyes too  Willing to get her a thousand miles from PrudencePlace I am going to order a chaise  I know no more than you what will be the result of it but I will follow my humour were it to lead me to the end of the earth and the water  I received your two letters but pray keep your money for other purposes There is no occasion to make the woman more uneasy by your damned presents  Her  affairs are now  mine  and whether she is ever nearer to me than she is now no man shall dare to be her banker but  OLLY MEDWAY  LETTER CXXVIII From the Same to the Same  Rome  WE are with Signora AUGUSTA sigh'd for the first six hundred miles of the journey every half hourthe rest of the way pretty well I have been with her to all her old friendsI have trotted after a fair face like a chit of nineteenBut she does not sigh above once a weekShe suits my humour to a hair I shall certainly have her in a short timeat least by the hand and if you don't interrupt me perhaps by the heartSend word when you are marriedThat will be my cue If you ever come to Rome I will  move with the Marchioness further still and if you resolve to pursue me I will cut your throat I did intend to give my money to  your  LUCIA but I shall now give it to  my  AUGUSTA Hush I'll follow my humour HushI am a man of few words and the Marchioness loves me the better for it Unless you die which I don't wish I will never return to England Nono Colonel let us be good friends at a distance No noise  OLLY MEDWAY  LETTER CXXIX Colonel CARLISLE to Mr MEDWAY  PrudenceGreen  THEN all may again be well Your letters charm me AUGUSTA will every day become more sensible of MEDWAY's merit and her good heart will be wholly his What a load is now removing from LUCIA and your friend Felicity seems once more to be flying towards PrudencePlaceSir ANDREW FLIGHT has wisely decamped MEDWAY and the Marchioness are in the way I most wish them the HEWSONS  are got homeMiss LASCELLES is so far composed to consent to live with her LUCIA and Mr DE GREY is better than he has been for some time  What then remains  Ah my friend need you be told  The greatest blessing of your CLEMENT's life remains  Tomorrow will LUCIA DE GREY be mine  for ever  You will not expect me to proceed  What could I possibly say more yes my dear MEDWAY I will venture to add farther this one sentence  However hypocrisy may flourish for a time even its happiest moments are clouded and  Truth  shall at last prevail  I am  Dear MEDWAY  Your very affectionate And obedient CLEMENT CARLISLE  FINIS
