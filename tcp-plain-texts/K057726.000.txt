 ROBIN HOOD  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  ROBIN HOOD OR SHERWOOD FOREST A COMIC OPERA  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  BY LEONARD MAC NALLY ESQ  LONDON Printed by J ALMON at No FleetStreet M DCC LXXXIV  To Mr WM SHIELD Composer to the TheatreRoyal CoventGarden  SIR  GIL BLAS advised a friend who had written for the stage with success to publish his works observing that as he had imposed upon the public by the representation of bad pieces he ought to open their eyes in gratitude for the reception they had met This Opera I fear like the works of the Spanish dramatist tho' applauded on the stage may fall under censure in the closet where it must appear divested of that aid it received from your excellent musical compositions and the incomparable acting with which the characters were supported The three principal ideas which combine the subject are not original but borrowed from the ballads of  Robin Hood  the  Nutbrown Maid  and the  The  Hermit of the Dale  is taken from a ballad called the  Friar of orders Grey  which is taken from an old ballad called the  Herdsman  Hermit of the Dale  I adopted them as being popular It was my first intention to have taken all the songs from old ballads those I have selected are I trust not ill chosen or unapplicable to the piece ROBIN HOOD and his merry Archers have often been upon the Stage The  Biographia Dramatica  gives an account of six pieces in which this celebrated outlaw was the hero exclusive of the  Sad Shepherd  by Ben Johnson but it does not appear that any of them met with success I address these observations to you as a tribute to your merit happy in having an opportunity of publicly assuring you that no man stands higher in my esteem Your friend  LEONARD MAC NALLY  DRAMATIS PERSONAE

 John  Well sung and strongly my blithe lads and hearty lasseslike true outlaws who lighten the heavy purses of the rich with clear consciences share your booty with the poor and wash down repentance with cups of nappy brown ale  Stella  Girls let us retire  The women retire into the cots  Bowman  Why are we called outlaws John  John  I'll tell you Laws were made to punish rogues but we being honest fellows are put out of the law  Bowman  Then honesty and law are not found together  John  True and therefore being honest we live against the law and yet with due deference to the learned profession we live honestly as those who live by the law  Bowman  Right John  John  MarkWe kill the King's deer and are called thieves but who are the greatest thieves we who feed on royal venison or those who prey upon his majesty's liege subjects Stand close and attend to me ladsour captain the brave Earl of Huntingdon has a call upon our service therefore every man must look to his arms let your quivers be well stocked with arrows and see that your bowstrings are all sound This night we sally forth on an expedition  Bowman  What is the cause  John  Our captain you all know was betrothed to the fair Clorinda niece to Baron Fitz Herbert You also know that on the very eve of marriage he was ordered from court  Bowman  True  John  Now this was all owing to the bishop of Hereford who maliciously poisoned the royal ear and the instant the noble Huntingdon became an object of the King's displeasure the whole court tribe even the very caterpillars who fed upon his bounty avoided him as if he was contagious  Bowman  But we John stuck to him and will while we have life  John  Give me your handa man never truly knows his friends till misfortune overtakes him But markOur leader's heart is fixed upon the lady Clorinda and she loves him with equal ardour but the proud Baron her uncle keeps her locked up and prevents all intercourse between them  Bowman  Why not attack the Baron's castle and carry her off by force  John  That is the business you are to be employed onwe will execute it this very night but not a word to Robin voluntary service is most valuable and tomorrow I trust we shall be able to present his mistress to him  A horn sounds  Hark Scarlet's horn  Enter  SCARLET  and Archers with  RUTTEKIN  the Tinker prisoner an Archer carrying his budget  John  Brave Scarlet welcomeWho have we got here  Examining Ruttekin  Scarlet  We discovered a company of men within the purlieus of the Forest on their way we suppose to the assizes at Nottingham  John  On their way to the assizes O the unconscionable dogs with intent no doubt to sue their honest debtors  Scarlet  They fled and all escaped but this fellow  John  What are you sirrah  Ruttekin  A tinker and a fool but no knave  John  Well distinguished for though all knaves are fools all fools are not knaves Where do you reside tinker  Ruttekin  Where I stand I carry my shop on my back as the snail carries his house am always at home yet am a traveller  John  A fool a traveller but that is no new case many of our travellers having proved themselves fools Let the tinker be free But say lads what plunder have you brought in  Scarlet  Not much We met a monk who denied having cash but Robin forced him to pray to his titular saint for some and after five minutes devotion on searching his reverence we found twenty broad pieces in his hood but the money did not remain long with us falling with one of the bishop of Hereford's tenants who was flying from his habitation being unable to pay his rent Robin with his accustomed humanity made him a present of the Friar's tribute  John  Perhaps this fellow is an impostor so open his pack  pointing to  Ruttekin  A good heart may lie in a deformed body a diamond may be concealed in a dunghill and why not gold or silver in this budget  They open the budget and throw out a fowl a bottle and loaf  Ruttekin  leaps into it  Ruttekin  Spare my property my budget contains my ways and means  Scarlet  Out of the budget or I'll knock you down  Ruttekin  What strike a man in his own shop  Horn sounds  John  There goes Robin's blast and calls me Away lads reinstate master Tinker in possession of his shop and moveables and give the poor devil some refreshment  Exit  Ruttekin  Lead away my merry folk and I'll dance after you  AIR  I mend pottles and canns  Hoop juggs patch kettles and pans  And over the country trudge it  I sing without measure  Nor fear loss of treasure  And carry my all in my budget  Here under the green leav'd bushes  Oh how we'll firk it  Caper and jirk it  Singing as blithe as thrushes  I'm not plagued with a wife  Live free from contest and strife  Blow high blow lowRuttekin never minds it  I eat when I'm hungry  Drink when I'm dry  Join pleasure wherever I find it  Here under the green leav'd bushes  Oh how we'll firk it  Caper and jirk it  Singing as blithe as thrushes  Exeunt  Enter  FRIAR  and  JOHN  fighting with quarterslaves two  ARCHERS  following    st Archer  Well done John    d Archer  Well laid on Friar  John  Let no man strike who loves me Friar you have beaten me soundly I retain the music of your fiddlestick in both my earsO heaven preserve us from the heavy arm of Mother Church  Friar  Have I done you justice  John  Yes justice with a vengeanceTo give the devil his due this infernal divine fights with Christian fortitudeThe last blow staggered my conscienceBut will you live among us priest  Friar  With all my heart upon this condition that if you need a chaplain I may serve you and your friends in that capacity  John  Will you be true  Friar  To the last moment I will be true to youwill attend to shrive Little John even at the gallows  John  I thank your charity reverend Sir and as one good turn deserves another be assured you shall not want a friend to shake hands with at the gibbet Our chaplain you shall be a confessor my hearts will make us new men every day by absolving us in the morning for our trespasses overnightBut we must not have too much devotion  Friar  Never fearThough I wear the habit of the church I am no devotee I love my friends pray for my enemies and my principal study is the art of living well with all mankind  John  And womenkind I presume  Friar  Who ordained you a confessorBut in truth though I have taken the vow of celibacy I reprobate a single life among the laity and think that were the superfluous productions of nature to be pruned away the business should commence by lopping off old maids and fusty batchelors  John  Rightthey are a malignant generation and like the rattlesnake increase in noise and venom with their years To what monastery do you belong  Friar  To none I am just returned from a crusade  John  I thought so for you laid on like a Turk  Enter  BOWMAN  with sheathed sword  Bowman  A stranger has surrendered to one of our outposts and is coming this way He demands an audience with Robin Hood immediately and sends his sword  Delivers the sword to  John  John  Conduct the stranger before usand see master Bowman take care of this honest Friar let him have liquor to moisten the clay for I see by his ruby nose he is a wet soul with a dry liver  Friar  Go on my lad and remember your orderslet me have liquor plenty to moisten the clay  AIR  I am just arriv'd from the Holy Land  Over the bush and under the briar  And I drink till I neither can sit walk nor stand  For I am a jolly old Friar  O I am a merry old Friar  I've swallow'd hogsheads butts gallons and quarts  Over the bush and under the briar  So light my heart mischance it never thwarts  For I am a jolly old Friar  O I am a merry old Friar  If on my way I meet a bonny lass  Over the bush and under the briar  Then I a blessing givesnug on the grass  For I am a jolly old Friar  O I am a merry old Friar  Exeunt  Friar  and  Bowman  John  Well chaunted and merrily a goodly psalmsinger yet his notes would sound better in a tavern than a cathedral  Enter  EDWIN  guarded  Edwin  I have told you my business is with Robin Hood only  To the guard  John  That may be but you cannot see the great Robin till first examined by Little John Who are you Sir  Edwin  A  gentleman  courteous Sir who wishes to be considered  your  humble servant  John  Fairly spokenAn humble servant is good because it is a rarity most servants assuming more impudence than their masters Now  Gentleman  is bad though it is a good title to travel with or live by for every fellow who has neither property or profession and is too lazy to work begs or plunders under the character of  Gentleman  Edwin  I agree with you Sir and the country is overrun with such vermin  John  Here comes our leader  Enter  ROBIN  Noble Captain this gentleman who says he is my humble servant desires to speak with you  Robin  I like his presenceYou appear a soldier SirReturn him his sword    To  John  It is my way to meet every man on equal terms and if you come for a trial of skill my bowbearer will see fair play  John  Never doubt my honor and if you beat Robin today John will indulge you with a bout tomorrow  Edwin  I would speak in private  John  Then I withdraw and in truth I am not in good fighting orderStella has run away with my heart and this Friar has raised so many knobs upon my head it feels like a bunch of grapes  Exit  Robin  Now Sir what are your commands  Edwin  Courage and generosity are congenial qualities I am confident you possess the first and doubt not but I shall experience the latter  Robin  You seem to speak from a brave and candid soul Whatever my men have taken shall be returned  Edwin  I only wish them to restore a hermit's garment You see before you an unhappy man scorned by the woman he loves urged by despair yet doating on the cause of his misery O heaven is there no comfort for me  AIR  Ye pow'rs who make virtue your care  O bend from your bowers above  Say why should distress and despair  Be the constant attendants on love  Should war with its widespreading force  Of nations the scourge and the curse  To tenfold its rage be encreas'd  The torments of lovers are worse  Ye pow'rs who make virtue your care  O bend from your bowers above  Say why should distress and despair  Be the constant attendants on love  Robin  Your sorrows breathing the genuine feelings of an injured mind engage my friendship Is it your intention to join our party You may command here every thing conducive to your ease  Edwin  You have my thanks but I must refuse your generous offer My mind long labouring with grief has determined upon retirement understanding there is a hermitage in the Forest lately occupied by a holy man now dead there lost to the world I wish to become his melancholy successor and pine out a life of wretchedness  Robin  May I enquire who you are  Edwin  My name is Edwin son to Sir Launcelot Barnard I am just returned from Palestine where for three years serving under a borrowed name I sought for death in battle  Robin  Command my services I knew your father well and often under him repelled my  country's foes The ingratitude of those I loved and served has driven me into this Forest an outlaw but no more of thatthough rough in manners and possessing asperity against the proud the avaricious and the luxuriant you shall find me not ungenerous to the distressed  Edwin  'Tis to your generosity I apply the simplicity of your manners I admire and despise the superficial civilities of life the mind of a soldier like his sword is more valuable for its temper than its polish  Robin  Henceforward we are friends but come let us in and drink a pledge to future amity Edwin your hand  takes Edwin's hand  I feel for you Alas I am myself a lover and though beloved in return suffer under all the excruciating pangs of absence  DUET  The stag through the forest when rous'd by the horn  Sore frighted high bounding flies wretched forlorn  Quick panting heart bursting the hounds now in view  Speed doubles speed doubles they eager pursue  But 'scaping the hunters again through the groves  Forgetting past evils with freedom he roves  Not so in his soul who from tyrant Love flies  The shaft still remains and despairing he dies  Exeunt  Enter  ALLEN  and  STELLA  Allen  I am certain something distresses you tell me my dear sister what is it I your brother and friend have a right to question you believe me Stella few women would fall into error if they made confidants of their male relations  Stella  I do believe you love me brother and I hope you have no reason to complain of my wanting affection Let me ask you a question what think you of Will Scarlet  Allen  That in manners he is a vain fop and in his heart a cunning deceiver Like an overripe pear fair without but bad within  Stella  You are right brother he is a fop for when he brings home posies from the meadows he always culls the sweetest and prettiest to ornament himself and he is a deceiver as poor Martha knows to her cost Oh poor Martha she was once the very life of the Forest  AIR  The laughing pow'rs  "That led the wanton hours  "When May was in her prime  "Open'd the cells of flow'rs  "To airy paramours  "And bid the lovesick poet sigh in rhyme"  Oh summer all too fair  Oh blisses all too high  Oh might she not have known  That sweetest flow'r the soonest blown  Is soonest gone  That clearest stream beneath a summer sky  May soon be dry  She never said  Can my dear love fly  Till he was fled  But what think you of Little John  Allen  I think him a russetan a goodly apple with a plain outside but sound core  Stella  And I think so too for he strews thyme under my window when he thinks I do not see him and when he gathers wild strawberries or filberts or finds honeycombs in the woods he always presents them to me untouched  Allen  There is as much difference between John and Scarlet as between an honest man and a knave I know they are both your admirers but be cautious in bestowing your affection you are very young Stella and love my girl has its bitters as well as sweets  Stella  I would tell you a secretbut you must hear me without censure or if you reprove remember the lessons of affection make the deepest impressions when breathed in gentleness  Allen  Speak with freedom Something I fear has hurt you  Stella  Yes I am hurt yet I cannot tell where I am pleased too yet I cannot tell why I sigh when I wish to smile Nay more I am warm in the cool shade and freeze even in the sun Heigh ho  Allen  And how long have you had this complaint  Stella  How long It has been coming on me by degrees at least these long long two months  Let me whisper you a question nay turn your head I cannot speak while you look in my face You must know Little John this day gave me some wild plumbsLa I cannot say a word more  Allen  Then the complaint lies there  Stella  Where brother wheremercy shew me Sure I do not eat too many wild plumbswhere does the complaint lie I feel the pain but cannot discover the seat of it  Allen  Lay your hand upon your heart and pronounce the name of John  Stella  ThereJohn John JohnBless me how it beatspit pit pit patHeigh ho my complaint I find is the heartburn and palpitation  Allen  The truth is you love John  Stella  Love a man O fie Yet certainly I have a great friendship for John You know brother when I fell into the river he plunged in and saved my life while Scarlet run for assistance  Allen  I do not blame your gratitude but be cautious John's simplicity might prove as injurious as Scarlet's cunning  Stella  I'll follow your advice for I have heard young girls often meet ruin where they expect security  Allen  And ever after suffer under the pangs of shame repentance and bitter grief  AIR  Hard beats her heart her eyes pour tears  Corroding grief consumes her years  No more she sports with damsels gay  But mourns in pennance night and day  Love makes her happy for a while  And then like thee she'll chearful smile  But soon the willow binds her head  She mourns a lover from her fled  Exeunt  Scene changes to another part of the Forest Enter  CLORINDA  in the dress of a huntress with bow and quiver  ANGELINA  as a male pilgrim  ANNETTE  as her page  Clorinda  Nay let me persuade you my sweet cousin do not depart till you see the result of my adventure  Angelina  That

of the passions be merciful to thy poor petitioner  Annette  Well this love has set you both mad but your madness Madam  to Clorinda  I think the most desirable Heaven defend me from the afflictions of my lady my lord I mean Melancholy madness is horrible But let who will sigh I will laugh through life while I breathe La I have had lovers of all professions and played them off with equal indifference  AIR  When the men a courting came  Flatt'ring with their prittle prattle  Of their fool'ries I made game  Rally'd with my tittle tattle  Cooing to me  Wooing to me  Teasing of me  Pleasing of me  Off'ring pelf  Each silly elf  Came wooing cooing bowing to me  The learn'd serjeant of the law  Shew'd his parchments briefs and papers  In his deeds I found a flaw  So dismiss'd him in the vapours  Cooing to me  Wooing to me  Teasing of me  Pleasing of me  Off'ring pelf  Each silly elf  Came wooing cooing bowing to me  Physic old display'd his wealth  With his nostrums but the fact is  I swore loud I'd keep my health  Nor die martyr to his practice  Cooing to me  Wooing to me  Teasing of me  Pleasing of me  Off'ring pelf  Each silly elf  Came wooing cooing bowing to me  But at last a swain bow'd low  Candid handsome tall and clever  Squeez'd my hand I can't tell how  But he won my heart for ever  Cooing to me  Wooing to me  Pressing of me  Blessing of me  He's no pelf  Yet for himself  I'll send all other lovers from me  Angelina  Some one comes this way  Clorinda  One of the merry archersHillo hillo tantivy  John  within  Hillo hillo hilloa  Enter  JOHN  By St Dunstan's shrine a Diana and with a voice shrill as the lark Egad fair nymph you make the welkin ring with your shrill notes But why salute me with a tantivy I being a batchelor and that gratulation only due to married gentry who come under the description of bucks    to  Clorinda  Save your reverence    bowing to  Angelina  I presume you are a palmer performing penance for the sins of your forefathers for thou art too young to have transgressed thyself But may I enquire are you returning from or going on a pilgrimage  Annette  Why ask what is your reason and what right has my master to answer you  John  Here is a chatterer Pray my little magpie has your tongue been split with a silver groat that it wags so glibly  Annette  You must know my good friend I and my master have traversed France crossed the Alps visited Jerusalem made an excursion into Turkey and  John  Enough enoughEgad my lad of wax the hinges of your tongue want no oiling But pray now to what purpose did you go through all this fatigue  Annette  In truth to little purpose our objects were beauty and virtue both of which we find flourish better at home than in any other soil Pray Sir give this inquisitive fellow an account of your travels  Angelina  I will indulge him with all my heart and then fair cousin without further ceremony or even a farewel I shall depart    to  Clorinda  My page has told you beauty and virtue were the objects of my search  BALLAD  I travers'd Judah's barren sand  At Beauty's altar to adore  But there the Turk had spoil'd the land  And Sion's daughters were no more  In Greece the bold imperious mien  The wanton look the leering eye  Bade Love's devotion not be seen  Where constancy is never nigh  From thence to Italy's fair shore  I urg'd my neverceasing way  And to Loretta's temple bore  A mind devoted still to pray  But there too Superstition's hand  Had fickli'd ev'ry feature o'er  And made me soon regain the land  Where beauty fills the western shore  Where Hymen with coelestial pow'r  Connubial transport doth adorn  Where purest virtue sports the hour  That ushers in each happy morn  Ye daughters of old Albion's isle  Wheree'er I go wheree'er I stray  O Charity's sweet children smile  To cheer a pilgrim on his way  Clorinda  May cheerfulness be thy guide and safety thy attendant  Exeunt  Angelina  and  Annette  John  I say Amen from the depth of my heart And now you more than mortal what is your business in the Forest  Clorinda  I seek a known bold archer who draws his bow with skill and can pierce an apple or split a wand at threescore yards distance  John  Then you have hit the mark and tho' I say it who should not say it there is not a tighter fellow of his inches in the Forest than your humble servant Little John  Clorinda  Art thou Little John  John  The same ladyBut see I have no apprehension from the quiver of your eyes my affections are engaged and my heart is proof against their arrows But for your comfort there are charitable men in the Forest and you may secure half a dozen strings to your bow  Clorinda  Half a dozen Cry you mercy Little John I have heard of your prowess it is true but seek a man at least a

one of us and I am the man  Ruttek  Let me decide this dispute What are your pretensions  Scarlet  I love her  Ruttek  You love herWhat do you say  John  I love her  Ruttek  You love her tooSo far

Mark my wordsif you dare attempt any villainy against the chastity of Stella may I never draw an arrow to the head if I don't split you from the coxcomb to the waistband  Scarlet  Ha ha ha  John  Yes

the Forest  Scarlet  If you are for that work let us determine the contest this instant  Draws his sword  Ruttek    Holding  John  Don't split him while I am here  John  Let me at him Tinker Yet it kicks against the grain of my manhood to stain my sword with splitting a spiced plover a fellow who smells savory as a jack with a pudding in its belly who plaisters his face overnight with grease and flour and looks in the morning for all the world like a pigeon in paste  Ruttek  Take a fool's advice in this business court the girl openly and let him who wins her wear her  Scarlet  There is wisdom in the fool's advice  John  And I agree to the fool's advice he is a wise fool  Ruttek  Right lads Risk your lives for a woman Ha ha ha What woman would do so for you my dapper jackasses pigmies of fourteen to the dozen It is more than I could expect who am a man of size but I never quarrel for my mistresses though always soused over head and ears in the tender passion enamoured with every

wrestling Oh we shall have rare fun  Clorinda  Not those who have their bones broken John  John  Then we shall have bullbaiting and morricedancingO how I long to be capering  Robin  Dance till you

fools keep the high road it is your wise men who go aside and fall into the ditch  John  You may trust him with the delivery of a message he will be true to your word though a liar and a tinker  Ruttekin  No slur upon tinkers they are found in every honourable profession Your politician's a tinker in mending the state kettle when he patches up one hole he makes two your poet's a tinker he hammers out new works from other men's old wit the lawyer's a tinker he deals in brass and opens more flaws than he stops and what's your physician why a tinker too a brazier of old battered constitutions and if he cures you of a gout will take care to leave a rheumatism behind for a new job  Exit  John  Well I'll to my dutymen women and children are busy in their several vocations  The

you owe your country consuming life and reputation within the sequestered shades of a forest  Robin  You know the wrongs I have suffered My services overlooked banished on a false accusation stigmatized with the imputation of a rebellious spirit and even you my betrothed wife forced from my arms  Clorinda  Consider Robin when our country is in danger all offences should be absolved the remembrance of all injuries be forgotten all parties should unite every heart pant and every arm act for her honor and defence Robin postpone our nuptials till reconciled to your sovereign I would marry the leader of an armynot the captain of an outlawed band  Robin  She shakes my soulI will put her heart to the test  aside  I am determined here to spend my dayshere to live as I have donethis

Stella  Of me lady  Clorinda  Yes of you lady John says you are cruel flintyhearted and illnatured  Allen  And I know he loves her though too modest to urge his suit  Stella  Loves me Then indeed he never told me so and I rather think he fears me He approaches me with a cautious step then looks at me with a cunning eyesoand when he gives me any thing if his hand should but touch mine la la he trembles just as if I was a wild beast But I will tell you a secret  Clorinda  A secret O mercy let us hear it  Stella  I fear I have done a wrong thing Scarlet has been at our cottage and he swore so much I promised to meet him here  Allen  That was wrong indeed Never forget my dear sister that to preserve character we should avoid even the appearance of imprudence a wound on the character of a young female like an incision on the bark of a tree expands with maturity  Clorinda  And I have heard that this same Scarlet with all his foppery is an insinuating designing fellow and that more than one unhappy maid mourns his treachery  Allen  It is true Lady Martha one of Stella's fairest companions is now a wanderer through the Forest lamenting and upbraiding in all the horror of melancholy madness her own weakness and the wickedness of her seducer Take example by her dear Stella  AIR  Once she was though now she's sad  As the springing season glad  E'er beheld in its domain  Or fair Summer in her train  Or rich Autumn in his year  Sing she could as skylark clear  E'er alas with grief to tell  Into ways of shame she fell  Now her burden's constantly  "Pity me maids pity me  "Pity me a ruin'd maid  "Pining in the cypress shade"  Woods that wave o'er mountain tops  O'er whose moss the titmouse hops  Tell her tale to rustling gales  Fountains weep it through the vales  And with her own sorrow saint  Sighing Echo joins the plaint  Martha fair for ever sad  Wanders melancholy mad  And thus sings the bitterly  "Pity me maids pity me  "Pity me a ruin'd maid  "Pining in the cypress shade"  Exit  Enter  JOHN  John  Robinfair ladybless me    Surprized at seeing  Stella  Stella  You see I told you truthHe is always frightened at me  John  I am not frightenedI do not know

 John  Heigh ho O my poor heart  Clorinda  Farewell I leave you together and John take care make the best use of your time you know you have a rival and this same love is a fantastical passion a riddle which the wisest cannot resolve  AIR  The flame of love assuages  When once it is reveal'd  But fiercer still it rages  The more it is concealed  Consenting makes it colder  When met it will retreat  Repulses make it bolder  And dangers makes it sweet  Exit  John  Hem  Stella  Heigh ho Margery  John  I have shot the first arrow  Aside  Stella  Are you there John  John  Yes StellaCourage

follows  John  We would do as our parents did before usmarry  Stella  La that word marry is enough to frighten poor little Cupid out of the Forest married folks seldom agreethere is George a Green abused his wife in the honeymoon and struck her before the end of the year to be sure she has a tongue and a way of flinging things at his head  John  We should have none of this work Stella though such domestic breezes are as necessary in some families as thunder storms in hot weather the one clears the house of soul language and the other frees the air of soul vapours  Stella  Then John my brother says I am too young though I want only eleven months one week and two days of eighteen But how should we maintain ourselves  John  Prudent soul how she looks forward to a young familyI will maintain you by my wit my girl a means by which many great folks hold up their heads besides I have goods and chattels all the furniture you have seen in my cottage shall be yours and egad I will throw all you have not seen into the bargain  Stella  Thank you from my heart Johnand in return all I possess is at your service  John  Honestly spoken so thus I seize upon the fruits of your father's industry and your mother's labour  Kisses her  Friar  Within  This waythis way  Stella  Mercy here are some men coming  John  Who in the name of Old Nick are they let us stand aside and see  Enter

you shall be hanged without further trial as a notorious liar Will you challenge any of the Jury  Scarlet  You know John I'd fight the best of them  John  Fight the best of you he don't understand the term but gentlemen it is legal practice that the prisoner should be ignorant of the proceedings carried on against him  To the Archers  Scarlet  Will you listen to reason  John  Listen to reason No sirrah not on the part of the prisoner I sit here as a judge of law not of reason besides I have four reasons for hanging you First you must be hanged because I am not to sit here for nothing secondly you must be hanged because you have nobody to stand up for you thirdly you must be hanged because you appear in  forma pauperis  without money and fourthly you must be hanged because you have a damned

are early at duty  John  Yes Justice should never sleep  Robin  True John nor should Mercy ever close her eyes  Clorinda  That sentiment breathes philanthropy How comes this uncle I have persuaded my Robin to sue his Sovereign for grace  Aside  Friar  Then procure my dismission and all is well  Aside  Clorinda  May I interfere  John  The business is over madam we have fully convicted the prisoners will you pronounce judgment on the Friar    To  Robin  Shall we hang him up or cut him down  Robin  We will leave him John to the accusations of his own conscience a severer punishment than any we can inflict Your profession Sir should have taught you principles of honour  John  Principles of honourYou mistake your man this fellow is one of those itinerant mendicants who travel the country and ripen in the sunshine of public charity producing very little devotion with a plentiful crop of sensuality  Friar  Will you dismiss me  John  Yes to the other world  Robin  Prudence would justify my inflicting on you the severest punishment but humanity forbids it Go to the proud bishop of Hereford and tell him an outlaw instructed a churchman by example that charity which he should practise as well as teach  Friar  I obey and your message shall be delivered literally But be assured when next we meet you shall not have all the advantage I will have ample satisfaction for this generosity  Robin  Bowman order him safe conduct through the Forest    Exeunt  Friar  and  Bowman  And now for you Sir    To  Scarlet  your ingratitude hurts me and your base intent upon this innocent girl I cannot forgive  for let me tell you Sir there does not exist a greater wretch than he who by persuasion and perjury seduces to shame the object of his passion  John  I know of none greater except the villain who having ruined abandons  Stella  Might I implore his pardon on condition  Robin  What is the condition Stella  Stella  That he marries poor Martha She is just now returned to her mother's cottage overwhelmed with grief  Robin  This if he performs shall again restore him to the Forest    Exit  Scarlet  Come girls the morning is fine and we shall rouse a stag before breakfast  Stella

mine  Enter  EDWIN  Edwin  Hail my youthful guests I hope this humble cell has afforded you comfort  Angelina  We owe you grateful thanks  Edwin  The morning sun has pierced the Forest's gloom and

those blessings which the allwise the allbenignant hand of Heaven daily pours on him  Walks to  Ruttekin  Angelina  What persuasive melody breathes in his voice  Annette  I could hear him preach for an hour Pity so sensible so young and clever a man should turn hermit  Edwin  See where this fool improvident of time shrouded in temporary death dozes through life and indolently loses Heaven's most

chine and I cut down a Bashaw of three tails  Ruttek  Ha ha He was a devil of a Bashaw And you cut off his tails  Annette  True but it being our misfortune to be taken prisoner we were carried to the house of a Musti where my master falling in love with the  Musti's wife and being discovered by him in the lady's apartment to save himself he stabbed the old fellow to the heart  Ruttek  That was right it was serving Heaven to kill a Turk  Annette  We fled of course and after long wandering came to a seaport where we took shipping and at last arrived in Old England  Ruttek  And pray now had you any loveaffair upon your hands  Annette  CertainlyI intrigued in the seraglio of a Janissary who had a wife for every week and a concubine for every day in the year  Ruttek  O poor fellow he had

years absence grief and the hermit's habit have caused the change I have felt for three long years my spirit pine through weeping hours but now thy smile lights up my mind and all my sorrows vanish
