 c  THE SHEPHERDS LOTTERY A Musical Entertainment  PART I  SCENE I  THYRSIS  RECITATIVE  _THO' lawless War has quench'd her flaming Brand  That long too long has thinn'd this frighted Land  Tho'  Ceres  ' heaps my loaded Gran'ries fill  And my proud Oxen graze on ev'ry Hill  Yet my fond Heart is fill'd with deepest Cares  For  Thyrsis  loves and while he dotes despairs  AIR  What Beauties does my Nymph disclose  Less fair the silver Lilly blows  Such Blushes glow not on the Rose  As on the Cheeks of  Phillis  The other Day upon the Green  I saw a Nymph of heav'nly Mien  I ran to greet the  Cyprian  Queen  But found it was my  Phillis  By mossy Grot with Ivy bound  Where fragrant Woodbines curl around  And Daisies dapple o'er the Ground  I sit and murmur  Phillis  And when the Lark with dewy Wings  To hail the Morn exulting springs  I rise and tune the trembling Strings  To praise my dearest  Phillis  When first I saw the lovely Maid  I gaz'd inraptur'd and dismay'd  My faltring Tongue was quite afraid  To tell my Pangs to  Phillis  Then  Cupid  aim'd his sharpest Dart  At once I felt the pleasing Smart  That very Hour I lost my Heart  And now it dwells with  Phillis  Exit  SCENE II  DAPHNE PHILLIS  DAPHNE  Recit  What still in Tears Cast ev'ry Fear away  Tomorrow  Phillis  is the First of  May    Then as the Custom of the Place demands  Each vent'ring Shepherd in due Order stands  And from the Urn draws forth his future Wife  Phillis  no more shall lead a maiden Life  PHILLIS  Ah  Daphne Daphne  hence my Sorrows rise  Thyrsis  is he whom I alone can prize  Shou'd any other draw my hapless Name  My Death shall witness how sincere my Flame  DAPHNE  Talk not so wild whate'er his Face may be  Or this or that 'tis all alike to me  Or grant One chiefly struck my am'rous Eye  Yet trust me  Phillis  I for none would die  PHILLIS  Ah where will gentle Love a Shelter find  If he forsake the Breast of Womankind  AIR  Oh let me unreserv'd declare  The Dictate of my Breast  My  Thyrsis  reigns unrivall'd there  An everwelcome Guest  No more our spritely Nymphs I meet  But seek the lonely Grove  There sighing to myself repeat  Some tender Tale of Love  When absent from my longing Sight  He is my constant Theme  His shadowy Form appears by night  And shapes the morning Dream  Ye spotless Virgins of the Plain  Deem not my Words too free  For ere my Passion you arraign  You must have lov'd like me  Exit  SCENE III  DAPHNE  Recit  Unhappy Girl I know the Pangs of Love  And often sigh when in the silent Grove  My faithless Traitor from my Passion fled  And left me weeping in a lonely Bed  Henceforth my Arts I'll on their Sex employ  Their Vows my Laughter and their Pangs my Joy  AIR  My Pride is to hold all Mankind in my Chain  The Conquest I prize tho' the Slaves I disdain  I'll teaze them and vex them  I'll plague and perplex them  Since Men try all Arts our weak Sex to betray  I'll show them a Woman's as cunning as they  Young  Damon  ador'd me and  Lycon  the vain  By turns I encourag'd each amorous Swain  They knelt and they trembled  I smil'd and dissembled  Since Men try all Arts our weak Sex to betray  I'll show them a Woman's as cunning as they  Then hear me ye Nymphs and my Counsel believe  Resist all their Wiles the Deceivers deceive  Their Canting and Whining  Their Sighing and Pining  Are all meant as Baits our weak Sex to betray  Then prove there are Women as cunning as they  Exit  SCENE IV  A GROVE  COLIN  discover'd playing on his Pipe  AIR  The Drum is unbrac'd and the Trumpet no more  Shall rouse the fierce Soldier to fight  Our Meads shall no longer be floated with Gore  Nor Terror disturb the calm Night  Once more o'er the Fields golden Harvests shall shine  The Olive her Flowrets increase  Again purple Clusters shall blush on the Vine  These these are the Blessings of Peace  The Shepherd securely now roams thro' the Glade  Or merrily pipes in the Vale  The Youth in soft Numbers attempts his coy Maid  The Virgins dance blithe in the Dale  The Flow'rs with gay Colours embroider the Ground  Unpress'd by an Enemy's Feet  The Bleatings of Sheep from the Hillocks resound  And the Birds their trim Sonnets repeat  SCENE V  To him  Thyrsis  THYRSIS  Recit  Thrice happy  Colin  you the whole Day long  Teach ev'ry Hill to catch your jocund Song  So the blithe throstle carols thro' the Grove  His Breast unwounded by the Thorns of Love  COLIN  True  Thyrsis  true I ne'er could sigh and pine  And call a proud denying Fair divine  Each Nymph I see has got some Charm to strike  And those who yield the soonest best I like  THYRSIS  As verdant Fields the blasted Heath surpass  As gen'rous Corn exceeds the meaner Grass  As Palms are nobler than the Shrubs they shade  So  Phillis  triumphs o'er each other Maid  COLIN  I like young  Doris  in her russet Gown  Ripe as the Pear and as the Berry brown  Her ruddy Cheeks the Cherry's Hue display  And warm and buxom as a Summer's Day  THYSIS  Tomorrow is the Period of my Fate  My Hopes my Fears do on Tomorrow wait  Then Fortune gives me  Phillis  for a Wife  Or ends my ev'ry Suff'ring with my Life  COLIN  Ye Lovers much profess and yet I'm told  Ye seldom long the same Opinion hold  You knew young  Strephon  he who on the Ring  But hearken  Thyrsis  I'll the Story sing  AIR  To dear  Amaryllis  young  Strephon  had long  Declar'd his fix'd Passion and dy'd for in Song  He went one  May  Morning to meet in the Grove  By her own dear Appointment this Goddess of Love  Meanwhile in his Mind all her Charms he ran o'er  And doted on each  can a Lover do more  He waited and waited then changing his Strain  'Twas Fury and Rage and Despair and Disdain  The Sun was commanded to hide his dull Light  And the whole course of Nature was alter'd downright  'Twas his hapless Fortune to die and adore  But never to change  can a Lover do more  Cleora  it hap'd was by Accident there  No Rosebud so tempting no Lilly so fair  He press'd her white Hand next her Lips he essay'd  Nor would she deny him so civil the Maid  Her kindly Compliance his Peace did restore  And dear  Amaryllis  was thought of no more  SCENE VI  THYRSIS  Recit  Unhappy State of these offending Plains  For Guilt long since the Punishment remains  Not free to choose our youngest Virgins stand  The Sport of Chance for such is  Pan  's Command  O Fortune to my Pangs propitious prove  And crown with due Success my constant Love  Exit  SCENE VII  PHILLIS  AIR  Ye Nymphs of the Plain who once saw me so gay  You ask why in Sorrow I spend the whole Day  'Tis Love cruel Love that my Peace did betray  Then crown your poor  Phillis  with Willow  The Bloom which once grac'd has deserted this Cheek  My eyes no more sparkle my Tongue can scarce speak  My Heart too so flutters I fear it will break  Then crown your poor  Phillis  with Willow  Ye Lovers so true that attend on my Bier  And think that my Fortune has prov'd too severe  Ah curb not the Sigh nor refuse the kind Tear  Then strew all the Place round with Willow  Erect me a Tomb and engrave on its Side  "Here lies a poor Maiden whose Love was deny'd  "She strove to endure it but could not and dy'd"  Then shade it with Cypress and Willow  SCENE VIII  To her  Thyrsis  THYRSIS  Recit  O lovely Maiden dearer to my Sight  Than the gay Fires that gild the Gloom of Night  Here at your Feet let me transported own  How much I  Phillis  love and her alone  DUET  THYRSIS  When Fairies dance round on the Grass  And revel to Night's awful Noon  O say will you meet me sweet Lass  All by the clear Light of the Moon  PHILLIS  My Passion I seek not to screen  Then can I refuse you your Boon  I'll meet you at Twelve on the  Green  All by the clear Light of the Moon  The Nightingale perch'd on a Thorn  Then charms all the Plains with her Tune  And glad of the Absence of Morn  Salutes the pale Light of the Moon  THYRSIS  How sweet is the Jessamin Grove  And sweet are the Roses of  June    But sweeter's the Language of Love  Breath'd forth by the Light of the Moon  Too slow rolls the Chariot of Day  Unwilling to grant me my Boon  Away envious Sunshine away  Give place to the Light of the Moon  PHYLLIS  But say will you never deceive  The Lass whom you conquer'd too soon  And leave a lost Maiden to grieve  Alone by the Light of the Moon  THYRSIS  The Planets shall start from their Spheres  Ere I prove so fickle a Loon  Believe me I'll banish thy Fears  Dear Maid by the Light of the Moon  BOTH  Our Loves when the Shepherds shall view  To us they their Pipes shall attune  While we our soft Pleasures renew  Each Night by the Light of the Moon  Exeunt  PART II  SCENE I  DAPHNE DORYLAS  DORYLAS  Recit  SWEET Nymph this Token of my Love receive  Tho' mean's the Present that a Swain can give  Yet should a Smile the trifling Gift repay  My Heart will dance with Pleasure all the Day  DAPHNE  I take the Crook in Earnest of your Love  At Eight precisely in the Chesnut Grove  To  Faunus  ' Spring good  Dorylas  repair  'Tis very likelymy warm Blushes spare  'Tis very likely  Aside  I shall not be there  DORYLAS  Thrice happy  Dorylas  kind Maid Adieu  At Eight precisely I'll my Suit renew  Exit  SCENE II  DAPHNE  Farewel deluded Swain if Smiles can gain  Such pretty Presents I'll ne'er frown again  AIR  As soon hope for Peace 'twixt the Hawk and the Dove  As to find it with Woman and Man  Or prompted by Hate or incited by Love  They both will deceive when they can  The Shepherd forgetful of Oaths and of Vows  Will run to a Face that's more new  And often the Women or Maiden or Spouse  The very same Method pursue  The Youth to obtain the dear Nymph he admires  By Falshood expresses his Flame  To gain the lov'd Boy who her Bosom inspires  Does not  Cloe  exactly the same  How just's the Division Man's born to persuade  We listen and think him sincere  But then has not Nature been kind to the Maid  She gave her the Smile and the Tear  Intrepid as Heroes Men snatch at their Joy  And force us by Storm to comply  We helpless poor Creatures by Fashion made coy  Consent when we feebly deny  Like Armies drawn out into martial Array  The Sexes call forth all their Pow'rs  And if for the Men goes the Battle today  Tomorrow the Triumph is ours  Recit  But see young  Colin  casts this way his Look  Perhaps he means to bring another Crook  Fain would I force him to receive my Yoke  And own that  Cupid  's Laws are more than Joke  SCENE III  To her  Colin  COLIN  Sweet Lady tell me Did you see this way  Two milkwhite Lambs with rosy Collars stray  DAPHNE  No gentle Youth But pr'ythee tell me why  You greet a Village Maid in Terms so high  I am no Lady courteous Swain not I  COLIN  Since you my lov'd Companions have not seen  Perhaps they've wander'd to yon distant  Green  I'll see  DAPHNE  Aside  Stay Shepherd stayWas ever such a stupid Swain  He seems to eye me with a cold Disdain  To him  Some time methinks with  Colin  I could waste  COLIN  Dispatch then quickly I'm in truth in haste  AIR  DAPHNE  Has the Arrow of  Cupid  ne'er lodg'd in your Breast  Have you wept for whole Months nor been able to rest  'Till the Fair One took pity and bid you be bless'd  Speak boldly the Truth my good Shepherd  COLIN  No that I can't brag of but all the Day long  Some Mistress or other has place in my Song  My Passion's not lasting but 'tis very strong  I speak the plain Truth my good Lady  DAPHNE  I doubt you're a Rover if so a young Maid  May fear to be with you within this thick Shade  COLIN  Such Beauties as yours need be never afraid  I speak the plain Truth my good Lady  DAPHNE  Suppose a young Shepherdess just of my Size  An Air too like mine and a pair of such Eyes  Should like you say would you your Conquest despise  Speak boldly the Truth my good Shepherd  COLIN  PlainDealing's a Jewel you very well know  And therefore permit me to own ere I go  Such a Mistress as you is at best but so so  I speak the plain Truth my good Lady  COLIN  Farewel gentle Maiden  DAPHNE  Farewel thou dull Swain  Go seek thy Companions that brouze on the Plain  BOTH  And I care not if e'er I behold thee again  I speak the plain Truth  c  Exeunt severally  SCENE IV  Discovers a Statue of  Pan  near which is placed an Urn Many Shepherds are discovered who have drawn standing with the Women who have fallen to their Lot  THYRSIS  and  PHILLIS  THYRSIS  Recit Arcadian Pan  whose happy Influence yields  Health to our Flocks and Plenty to our Fields  If ere the Thoughts of  Syrinx  warm'd your Soul  Or when to kinder  Dryope  you stole  Suspend your Rage assist my amorous Pray'r  And to her  Thyrsis  give the matchless Fair  Advances to draw  PHILLIS  AIR  Goddess of the dimp'ling Smile  Quit ah quit thy fav'rite Isle  Crown'd with Myrtle Wreath advance  From the Hand of giddy Chance  Snatch the Pow'r to make me bless'd  Be it thine to ease my Breast  In her Ivory Car the fair Queen I behold  Her Cygnets in Trappings of Purple and Gold  Displaying their Pinions I see the young Loves  All brighter than Sunshine all soft as her Doves  With Raptures O  Venus  I bow at thy Shrine  She whispers me softly Young  Thyrsis  is thine  THYRSIS  Recit  O happy  Thyrsis  let the Hills around  And every Valley catch the pleasing Sound  Waft it ye Breezes to the  Cyprian  Shore  Thyrsis  is blest and asks of Fate no more  Embraces  Phillis  SCENE V  and  LAST  To them  Colin  and  Daphne  PHILLIS  You come my  Daphne  in an happy Hour  Each Cloud's dispell'd and Tempests cease to lour  DAPHNE  Joy to my dear but unexperienc'd Friend  Who thinks that Love and Raptures know no end  COLIN  Joy to my  Thyrsis  and to thee my Fair  The Yoke is lasting that you're doom'd to wear  May  Love  and  Hymen  never be at odds  For both are young and wond'rous testy Gods  THYRSIS  Haste to the Urn there there your Fortune try  COLIN  I humbly thank you but indeed not I  This kind of Lott'ry does not hit my Taste  A Wife is no such mighty Prize at last  AIR  How giddy is Youth yet above all Advice  You counsel and counsel in vain  I've try'd what is Wedlock and like it so well  That I'll never be marry'd again  The Spouse that I pitch'd on was comely and young  And sweet as the Flow'rs of the Plain  She was wise as they tell me perhaps it might be  But I'll never be marry'd again  I saw the poor Creature laid deep in the Grave  My Tears they came pouring like Rain  But as Sunshine you know will foul Weather succeed  I quickly recover'd again  Like the Castles of Fairies it seems to the Sight  And Fancy indulges the Rein  But alas when you try it 'tis all a mere Cheat  And the same dull Tale over again  DAPHNE  Recit  Once more well met polite engaging Swain  What Maid but must adore thy soothing Strain  DUET  O say must I sigh and pine my Love  O say must I sigh and pine  You're cruel I swear  As a Tiger or Bear  If you don't to my Wish incline my Love  If you don't to my Wish incline  COLIN  So much I delight in thee my Dear  So much I delight in thee  Thou may'st sigh pine and moan  Or may'st let it alone  'Tis all the same to me my Dear  'Tis all the same to me  DAPHNE  But say should I break my Heart my Love  But say should I break my Heart  Would you not be dismay'd  To have murder'd a Maid  With  Cupid  's keenest Dart my Love  With  Cupid  's keenest Dart  COLIN  I should not be much dismay'd my Dear  I should not be much dismay'd  If you think that I lye  You had better go try  I am not much afraid my Dear  I am not much afraid  DAPHNE  Since nothing I find will do my Love  Since nothing I find will do  My Heart I'll break  No I'll live for your sake  And I'll live to laugh at you my Love  And live to laugh at you  THYRSIS  Recit  Cease all your Jars while we my gentle Maid  Pursue true Pleasure in the rosy Shade  But hasten Swains your annual Homage pay  And hail with jolly Sounds the youthful  May  AIR  THYRSIS  Now the Snowdrop lifts her Head  Cowflips rise from golden Bed  Silver Lillies paint the Grove  Welcome  May  and welcome Love  PHILLIS  Hark the merry Finches sing  Heralds of the blooming  Spring    And the artless Turtledove  Coes at once to  May  and Love  THYRSIS  Long the claycold Maid denies  Nor regards her Shepherd's Sighs  Now your fond Petitions move  May  's the Season form'd for Love  PHILLIS  While adown the slopy Hill  Tinkles soft the gushing Rill  Balmy Scents perfume the Grove  May  unbends the Soul to Love  DAPHNE  Now the Bee on silv'ry Wings  Flow'ry Spoils unweary'd brings  Spoils that Nymphs and Swains approve  Soft as  May  and sweet as Love  And the Swallow's chirping Brood  Skim around the crystal Flood  Then in wanton Circlets rove  Playful as the God of Love  COLIN  On the Fair that deck our Isle  May each Grace and Virtue smile  And our happy Shepherds prove  Days of Ease and Nights of Love  Exeunt omnes  A Dance of Shepherds  c  This Song is sung by  Dorylas  in the First Scene of the Second Part after the Words  At Eight precisely I'll my Suit renew  and was by mistake omitted  AIR  How happy's the Lover whose Cares are no more  Who bids an Adieu to all Sorrow  My Griefs are all husht and my Torments are o'er  For I shall be happy tomorrow  Each flow'ret of  Spring  that enamels the Ground  From you ev'ry Charm seems to borrow  Then who will so blest or so happy be found  As I with my  Daphne  tomorrow  I never am happy but when in your Sight  Your Smiles are the Cure of all Sorrow  Remember dear  Daphne  your Promise tonight  And I shall be happy tomorrow  FINIS
