Written and Selected By FRANCIS FAWKES MA And WILLIAM WOTY  IN TWELVE VOLUMES  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed by DRYDEN LEACH For J COOTE at the King's Arms in PaternosterRow MDCCLXIII  THE POETICAL CALENDAR  APRIL AN ODE  TO woo green April lo the sun  That very form which Jove put on  To bear Europa from her native land  Assumes to win the queen of showers  A newblown primrose decks her hand  Her taper waist a zone of flowers  Like a young widow she appears  Shining thro' shades and beautiful in tears  Now genial nature every seed  Opens to grace the vernal mead  The lark now ventures up the sapphire skies  Tho' Zephyr shakes his madid wing  Yet warmth awakes the embryo flies  To creep and meet parental spring  When lo a shower of drizzling rain  Or drowns or drives them to their nests again  Prolific mists o'er every rill  Preside and shade the distant hill  A tepid moisture gladdens every root  The husbandmen now pole and bind  The hops and bid the tendrils shoot  Thus guarded from the southern wind  While every vegetative power  Imbibes young April's soft balsamic shower  Mark how each month's unwearied toil  Successive cloaths or strips the soil  From heat to cold they traverse thro' the sky  And yet unerring is the plan  And regular from hot to dry  The calendar of social man  In no one track the steps appear  Yet all to one united centre steer  W  AN ODE  STern winter now by spring repress'd  Forbears the longcontinued strife  And nature on her naked breast  Delights to catch the gales of life  Now o'er the rural kingdom roves  Soft Pleasure with her laughing train  Love warbles in the vocal groves  And vegetation paints the plain  Unhappy whom to beds of pain  Arthritic tyranny consigns  Whom smiling nature courts in vain  Tho' rapture sings and beauty shines  Yet tho' my limbs disease invades  Her wings imagination tries  And bears me to the peaceful shades  Where 's humble turrets rise  Here stop my soul thy rapid flight  Nor from the pleasing groves depart  Where first great nature charm'd my sight  Where wisdom first inform'd my heart  Here let me thro' the vales pursue  A guide a father and a friend  Once more great nature's works review  Once more on wisdom's voice attend  From false caresses causeless strife  Wild hope vain fear alike remov'd  Here let me learn the use of life  Then best enjoy'd when most improv'd  Teach me thou venerable bower  Cool meditation's quiet seat  The generous scorn of venal power  The silent grandeur of retreat  When Pride by guilt to greatness climbs  Or raging factions rush to war  Here let me learn to shun the crimes  I can't prevent and will not share  But lest I fall by subtler foes  Bright wisdom teach me Curio's art  The swelling passions to compose  And quell the rebels of the heart  SPRING AN ODE  BY W WOTY  Redeunt jam gramina campis  Arboribusque comae  HOR  A Gain the blossom'd hedge is seen  The turf again is dress'd in smiling green  Again the lark ascends the sky  Winnows the air and lessens on the eye  The swallow that the meads forsook  Revisits now and skims along the brook  The daw to steepletop upsprings  And the rook spreads his ventilating wings  The feather'd tribe on every spray  Chant lively carols to the vernal day  Each lengthening morn's diurnal light  Beams fresher beauties on the raptur'd sight  The leaves hang clustering on the trees  And Health comes riding on the tepid breeze  Wheree'er the goddess fans her way  Creation feels her universal sway  The garden moist with April showers  Teems with a family of laughing flowers  Not even a ray or drop of rain  But what impregnates or that shines in vain  Yet tho' the bounteous hand of heaven  All good this liberality has given  Beyond our wishes amply kind  Ingratitude still stains the human mind  Man sees around celestial power  And thankless tastes the blessings of each hour  He reaps the produce of the plains  And meanly thinks it tribute for his pains  Fond wretch the sordid thought forbear  Nor to thy narrow self confine thy care  For know the Deity who gives today  Tonight may blast thy crops and snatch thy soul away  TO A YOUNG LADY ON HER BIRTHDAY BEING THE FIRST OF APRIL  LET others write for bydesigns  I seek some moral in my lines  Which whosoever reads must bear  Or great or learn'd or young or fair  Permit me then with friendly lay  To moralize your April day  Checquer'd your native month appears  With sunny gleams and cloudy tears  'Tis thus the world our trust beguiles  Its frowns as transient as its smiles  Nor pain nor pleasure long will stay  For life is but an April day  Health will not always last in bloom  But age or sickness surely come  Are friends belov'd why fate must seize  Or these from you or you from these  Forget not earnest in your play  For youth is but an April day  When piety and fortune move  Your heart to try the bands of love  As far as duty gives you power  Guiltless enjoy the present hour  Gather your rosebuds while you may  For love is but an April day  What clouds soe'er without are seen  Oh may they never reach within  But virtue's stronger fetters bind  The strongest tempest of the mind  Calm may you shed your setting ray  And sunshine end your April day  STANZAS ON THE SPRING  NOW from the southern climes returning spring  Breathes fragrant odours o'er th' enamell'd ground  The feather'd warblers flutter on the wing  And with their notes th' embowering woods resound  The rising sun when first he gilds the plains  Receives the tribute of the sylvan throng  And Philomela fraught with tragic strains  Tunes to the fullorb'd moon her plaintive song  Now blithsome Colin with his oaten reed  Delights the listening swains in glade or grove  While Corydon in yonder yellow mead  To Amaryllis tells his tale of love  At evening hour the nymphs and swains advance  And rang'd in order on the plain are seen  In various orbs revolve the rustic dance  And beat with measur'd pace the level green  The purple violet scents the mossy hill  And rich in bloom the fragrant hawthorn blows  While near the margin of some brawling rill  The cowslip brightens and the daisy glows  The lawns the mountains and the vocal woods  The groves with leaves adorn'd the fields with flowers  The hills the valleys and the crystal floods  Rejoice and seem to hail the vernal hours  Hark how the birds in consort raise their notes  And sweetly chant the renovated lay  'Tis nature's impulse tunes their warbling throats  To hail thee Flora goddess of the May  To thee of old on fair Ausonia's plains  With ease and wealth by godlike Titus blest  The blooming virgins and the jovial swains  Pour'd the full bowl and pil'd the annual feast  And still to thee in fair Britannia's isle  When each revolving year renews the spring  Beneath great George while ease and plenty smile  My swelling lyre shall annual tribute bring  Hail Flora goddess hail to thee belong  Those strains Theocritus of old essay'd  Be thine the lays be thine the tuneful song  Of every British swain and every beauteous maid  INSCRIPTION FOR AN HERMITAGE  FOnd man retire to this lone cell  And bid the busy world farewell  Ah quit the city's noisy scene  For pleasures tranquil and serene  Seek in this calm this sweet recess  The roselip'd cherub happiness  That haunts the hermit's mossy floor  And simple peasant's rural door  How pleasing is yon oak's brown shade  The spreading beech th' adjacent glade  The crystal streams that smoothly glide  The warbling thrush at eventide  Fond man here sweetly may'st thou spend  Thy fleeting days nor fear thy end  Stealing thro' life as thro' the plain  Yon rill flows silent to the main  Here when in russet vest the morn  Walks o'er the mountain or the lawn  Thy early orisons begin  And live secure from woe and sin  Here too at evening's sober hour  Adore the great almighty power  The sovereign ruler of the skies  For ever just and good and wise  ANACREONTIC ON THE SPRING  AS o'er the varied meads I stray  Or trace thro' winding woods my way  While opening flowers their sweets exhale  And odours breathe in every gale  Or stretch'd beneath the beechen shade  Descry from far the sunny glade  Where sage Contentment builds her seat  And Peace attends the calm retreat  My soul responsive hails the scene  Attun'd to joy and peace within  But musing on the liberal hand  That scatters blessings o'er the land  That gives for man with power divine  The earth to teem the sun to shine  My grateful mind with rapture burns  And pleasure to devotion turns  THE AFRICAN PRINCE NOW IN ENGLAND TO ZARA AT HIS FATHER'S COURT  WROTE IN THE YEAR MDCCXLIX  PRinces my fair unfortunately great  Born to the pompous vassalage of state  Whene'er the public calls are doom'd to fly  Domestic bliss and break the private tie  Fame pays with empty breath the toils they bear  And love's soft joys are chang'd for glorious care  Yet conscious virtue in the silent hour  Rewards the hero with a nobler dower  For this alone I dar'd the roaring sea  Yet more for this I dar'd to part with thee  But while my bosom feels the nobler flame  Still unreprov'd it owns thy gentler claim  Tho' virtue's awful form my soul approves  'Tis thine thine only Zara that it loves  A private lot had made the claim but one  The prince alone must love for virtue shun  Ah why distinguish'd from the happier crowd  To me the bliss of millions disallow'd  Why was I singled for imperial sway  Since love and duty point a different way  Fix'd the dread voyage and the day decreed  When duty's victim love was doom'd to bleed  Too well my memory can those scenes renew  We met to sigh to weep our last adieu  That conscious palm beneath whose towering shade  So oft our vows of mutual love were made  Where hope so oft anticipated joy  And plann'd of future years the blest employ  That palm was witness to the tears we shed  When that fond hope and all those joys were fled  Thy trembling lips with trembling lips I press'd  And held thee panting to my panting breast  Our sorrow grown too mighty to sustain  Now snatch'd us fainting from the sense of pain  Together sinking in the trance divine  I caught thy fleeting soul and gave thee mine  O blest oblivion of tormenting care  O why recall'd to life and to despair  The dreadful summons came to partand why  Why not the kinder summons but to die  To die together were to part no more  To land in safety on some peaceful shore  Where love's the business of immortal life  And happy spirits only guess at strife  " If in some distant land my prince should find  " Some nymph more fair you cried as Zara kind"  Mysterious doubt which could at once impart  Relief to mine and anguish to thy heart  Still let me triumph in the fear exprest  The voice of love that whisper'd in thy breast  Nor call me cruel for my truth shall prove  'Twas but the vain anxiety of love  Torn from thy fond embrace the strand I gain  Where mourning friends inflict superfluous pain  My father there his struggling sighs suppress'd  And in dumb anguish clasp'd me to his breast  Then sought conceal'd the conflict of his mind  To give the fortitude he could not find  Each lifetaught precept kindly he renew'd  " Thy country's good said he be still pursued  " If when the gods shall here my son restore  " These eyes shall sleep in death to wake no more  " If then these limbs that now in age decay  " Shall mouldering mix with earth's parental clay  " Round my green tomb perform the sacred rite  " Assume my throne and let thy yoke be light  " From lands of freedom glorious precepts bring  " And reign at once a father and a king"  How vainly proud the arrogantly great  Presume to boast a monarch's godlike state  Subject alike the peasant and the king  To life's dark ills and care's corroding sting  From guilt and fraud that strikes in silence sure  No shield can guard us and no arms secure  By these my fair subdued thy prince was lost  A naked captive on a barbarous coast  Nurtur'd in ease a thousand servants round  My wants prevented and my wishes crown'd  No painful labours stretch'd the tedious day  On downy feet my moments danc'd away  Wheree'er I look'd officious courtiers bow'd  Wheree'er I pass'd a shouting people croud  No fears intruded on the joys I knew  Each man my friend my lovely mistress you  What dreadful change abandon'd and alone  The shouted prince is now a slave unknown  To watch his eye no bending courtiers wait  No hailing crouds proclaim his regal state  A slave condemn'd with unrewarded toil  To turn from morn to eve a burning soil  Fainting beneath the sun's meridian heat  Rouz'd by the scourge the taunting jest I meet  Thanks to thy friends they cry whose care recalls  A prince to life in whom a nation falls  Unwholsome scraps my strength but half sustain'd  From corners glean'd and even by dogs disdain'd  At night I mingled with a wretched crew  Who by long use with woe familiar grew  Of manners brutish merciless and rude  They mock'd my sufferings and my pangs renew'd  In groans not sleep I pass'd the weary night  And rose to labour with the morning light  Yet thus of dignity and ease beguil'd  Thus scorn'd and scourg'd insulted and revil'd  If heaven with thee my faithful arms had bless'd  And fill'd with love my intervals of rest  Short tho' they were my soul had never known  One secret wish to glitter on a throne  The toilsome day had heard no sigh of mine  Nor stripes nor scorn had urg'd me to repine  A monarch still beyond a monarch blest  Thy love my diadem my throne thy breast  My courtiers watchful of my looks thy eyes  Should shine persuade and flatter and advise  Thy voice my music and thy arms should be  Ah not the prison of a slave in me  Could I with infamy content remain  And wish thy lovely form to share my chain  Could this bring ease forgive th' unworthy thought  And let the love that sinn'd atone the fault  Could I a slave and hopeless to be free  Crawl tamely recent from the scourge to thee  Thy blooming beauties could these arms embrace  My guilty joys enslave an infant race  No rather blast me lightnings whirlwind tear  And drive these limbs in atoms thro' the air  Rather than this O curse me still with life  And let my Zara smile a rival's wife  Be mine alone th' accumulated woe  Nor let me propagate my curse below  But from this dreadful scene with joy I turn  To trust in heaven of me let Zara learn  The wretch the sordid hypocrite that sold  His charge an unsuspecting prince for gold  That justice mark'd whose eyes can never sleep  And death commission'd smote him on the deep  The generous crew their port in safety gain  And tell my mournful tale nor tell in vain  The king with horror of th' atrocious deed  In haste commanded and the slave was freed  No more Britannia's cheek the blush of shame  Burns for my wrongs her king restores her fame  Propitious gales to freedom's happy shore  Waft me triumphant and the prince restore  Whate'er is great and gay around me shine  And all the splendor of a court is mine  And knowledge here by piety refin'd  Sheds a blest radiance o'er my brightening mind  From earth I travel upward to the sky  I learn to live to reign yet more to die  O I have tales to tell of love divine  Such blissful tidings they shall soon be thine  I long to tell thee what amaz'd I see  What habits buildings trades and polity  How art and nature vie to entertain  In public shows and mix delight with pain  O Zara here a story like my own  With mimic skill in borrow'd names was shown  An Indian chief like me by fraud betray'd  And partner in his woes an Indian maid  I can't recal the scenes 'tis pain too great  And if recall'd should shudder to relate  To write the wonders here I strive in vain  Each word would ask a thousand to explain  The time shall come O speed the lingering hour  When Zara's charms shall lend description power  When plac'd beside thee in the cool alcove  Or thro' the green Savannahs as we rove  The frequent kiss shall interrupt the tale  And looks shall speak my sense tho' language fail  Then shall the prodigies that round me rise  Fill thy dear bosom with a sweet surprize  Then all my knowledge to thy faithful heart  With danger gain'd securely I'll impart  Methinks I see thy changing looks express  Th' alternate sense of pleasure and distress  As all the windings of my fate I trace  And wing thy fancy swift from place to place  Yet where alas has flattering thought convey'd  The ravish'd lover with his darling maid  Between us still unmeasur'd oceans roll  Which hostile barks infest and storms controul  Be calm my bosom since th' unmeasur'd main  And hostile barks and storms are God's domain  He rules resistless and his power shall guide  My life in safety o'er the roaring tide  Shall bless the love that's built on virtue's base  And spare me to evangelize my race  Farewell thy prince still lives and still is free  Farewell hope all things and remember me  ZARA AT THE COURT OF ANAMABOE TO THE AFRICAN PRINCE NOW IN ENGLAND  SHould I the language of my heart conceal  Nor warmly paint the passion that I feel  My rising wish should groundless fears confine  And doubts ungenerous chill the glowing line  Would not my prince with nobler warmth disdain  That love as languid which could stoop to feign  Let guilt dissemblein my faithful breast  Love reigns unblam'd and be that love confest  I give my bosom naked to thy view  For what has shame with innocence to do  In fancy now I clasp thee to my heart  Exchange my vows and all my joys impart  I catch new transport from thy speaking eye  But whence this sad involuntary sigh  Why pants my bosom with intruding fears  Why from my eyes distil unbidden tears  Why do my hands thus tremble as I write  Why fades thy lov'd idea from my sight  O art thou safe on Britain's happy shore  From winds that bellow and from seas that roar  And has my princeOh more than mortal pain  Betray'd by ruffians felt the captive's chain  Bound were those limbs ordain'd alone to prove  The toils of empire and the sweets of love  Hold hold Barbarians of the fiercest kind  Fear heaven's red lightning'tis a prince ye bind  A prince whom no indignities could hide  They knew presumptuous and the gods defied  Wheree'er he moves let lovejoin'd reverence rise  And all mankind behold with Zara's eyes  Thy breast alone when bounding o'er the waves  To freedom's climes from slavery and slaves  Thy breast alone the pleasing thought could frame  Of what I felt when thy dear letters came  A thousand times I held them to my breast  A thousand times my lips the paper prest  My full heart panted with a joy too strong  And "Oh my prince" died faltering on my tongue  Fainting I sunk unequal to the strife  And milder joys sustain'd returning life  Hope sweet enchantress round my lovesick head  Delightful scenes of blest delusion spread  " Come come my prince my charmer haste away  " Come come I cried thy Zara blames thy stay  " For thee the shrubs their richest sweets retain  " For thee new colours wait to paint the plain  " For thee cool breezes linger in the grove  " The birds expect thee in the green alcove  " 'Till thy return the rills forget to fall  " 'Till thy return the sun the soul of all  " He comes my maids in his meridian charms  " He comes refulgent to his Zara's arms  " With jocund songs proclaim my love's return  " With jocund hearts his nuptial bed adorn  " Bright as the sun yet gentle as the dove  " He comes uniting majesty and love"  Too soon alas the blest delusion flies  Care swells my breast and sorrow fills my eyes  Ah why do thy fond words suggest a fear  Too vast too numerous those already here  Ah why with doubts torment my bleeding breast  Of seas that storms controul and foes infest  My heart in all this tedious absence knows  No thoughts but those of seas and storms and foes  Each joyless morning with the rising sun  Quick to the strand my feet spontaneous run  " Where where's my prince what tidings have ye brought"  Of each I met with pleading tears I sought  In vain I soughtsome conscious of my pain  With horrid silence pointed to the main  Some with a sneer the brutal thought exprest  And plung'd the dagger of a barbarous jest  Day follow'd day and still I wish'd the next  New hopes still flatter'd and new doubts perplex'd  Day follow'd day the wish'd tomorrow came  My hopes doubts fears anxieties the same  At length"O Power Supreme whoe'er thou art  " Thy shrine the sky the sea the earth or heart  " Since every clime and all th' unbounded main  " And hostile barks and storms are thy domain  " If faithful passion can thy bounty move  " And goodness sure must be the friend of love  " Safe to these arms my lovely prince restore  " Safe to his Zara's arms to part no more  " O grant to virtue thy protecting care  " And grant thy love to love's availing prayer  " Together then and emulous to praise  " A flowery altar to thy name we'll raise  " There first and last on each returning day  " To thee our vows of gratitude we'll pay"  Fool that I was to all my comfort blind  Why when thou went'st did Zara stay behind  How could I fondly hope one joy to prove  'Midst all the wild anxieties of love  Had fate in other mold thy Zara form'd  And my bold breast in manly friendship warm'd  How had I glow'd exulting at thy side  How all the shafts of adverse fate defied  Or yet a woman and not nerv'd for toil  Oh that with thee I'd turn'd a burning soil  In the cold prison had I lain with thee  In love still happy we had still been free  Then fortune brav'd had own'd superior might  And pin'd with envy while we forc'd delight  Why shouldst thou bid thy love remember thee  Thine all my thoughts have been and still shall be  Each night the cool Savannahs have I sought  And breath'd the fondness of enamour'd thought  The curling breezes murmur'd as I sigh'd  And hoarse at distance roar'd my foe the tide  My breast still haunted by a motley train  Now doubts now hopes prevail'd now joy now pain  Now fix'd I stand my spirit fled to thine  Nor note the time nor see the sun decline  Now rouz'd I start and wing'd with fear I run  In vain alas for 'tis myself I shun  When kindly sleep its lenient balm supplied  And gave that comfort waking thought denied  Last nightbut why ah Zara why impart  The fond fond fancies of a lovesick heart  Yet true delights on fancy's wings are brought  And love's soft raptures realiz'd in thought  Last night I saw methinks I see it now  Heaven's awful concave round thy Zara bow  When sudden thence a flaming chariot flew  Which earth receiv'd and fix white coursers drew  Thenquick transitiondid thy Zara ride  Borne to the chariotwonderousby thy side  All glorious both from clime to clime we flew  Each happy clime with sweet surprize we view  A thousand voices sung"All bliss betide  " The prince of Lybia and his faithful bride"  " 'Tis done 'tis done" resounded thro' the skies  And quick aloft the car began to rise  Ten thousand beauties crouded on my sight  Ten thousand glories beam'd a dazzling light  My thoughts could bear no more the vision fled  And wretched Zara view'd her lonely bed  Come sweet interpreter and ease my soul  Come to my bosom and explain the whole  Alas my princeyet hold my struggling breast  Sure we shall meet again again be blest  " Hope all thou say'st I live and still am free"  Oh then prevent those hopes and haste to me  Ease all the doubts thy Zara's bosom knows  And kindly stop the torrent of her woes  But that I know too well thy generous heart  One doubt than all more torment would impart  'Tis this in Britain's happy courts to shine  Amidst a thousand blooming maids is thine  But thou a thousand blooming maids among  Art still thyself incapable of wrong  No outward charm can captivate thy mind  Thy love is friendship heighten'd and refin'd  'Tis what my soul and not my form inspires  And burns with spotless and immortal fires  Thy joys like mine from conscious truth arise  And known these joys what others canst thou prize  Be jealous doubts the curse of sordid minds  Hence jealous doubts I give ye to the winds  Once more O come and snatch me to thy arms  Come shield my beating heart from vain alarms  Come let me hang enamour'd on thy breast  Weep pleasing tears and be with joy distrest  Let me still hear and still demand thy tale  And oft renew'd still let my suit prevail  Much still remains to tell and to enquire  My hand still writes and writing prompts desire  My pen denies my last farewell to write  Still still "return" my wishful thoughts indite  Oh hear my prince thy love thy mistress call  Think o'er each tender name and hear by all  Oh pleasing intercourse of soul with soul  Thus while I write I see I clasp thee whole  And these kind letters trembling Zara drew  In every line shall bring her to thy view  Return return in love and truth excell  Return I write I cannot add Farewell  ABELARD TO ELOISA  The editor of Poems by eminent ladies in two vol mo printed for R Baldwin in have ascribed this poem to mrs Madan and paid her handsome compliments upon it whereas mr Pattison late of Sidney Coll Camb is undoubtedly the author it being printed among his poems which were published AD In the memoirs of his life prefixed to his poems page there is likewise a letter dated York Oct wherein this poem is mentioned as Pattison's and much commended  BY MR WILLIAM PATTISON  IN my dark cell low prostrate on the ground  Mourning my crimes thy letter entrance found  Too soon my soul the wellknown name confest  My beating heart sprung fiercely in my breast  Thro' my whole frame a guilty transport glow'd  And streaming torrents from my eyes fast flow'd  O Eloisa art thou still the same  Dost thou still nourish this destructive flame  Have not the gentle rules of peace and heaven  From thy soft soul this fatal passion driven  Alas I thought thee disengag'd and free  And can'st thou still still sigh and weep for me  What powerful deity what hallow'd shrine  Can save me from a love and faith like thine  Where shall I fly when not this awful cave  Whose rugged feet the surging billows lave  When not these gloomy cloister's solemn walls  O'er whose rough sides the languid ivy crawls  When my dread vows in vain their force oppose  Oppos'd to lovealas how vain are vows  In fruitless penitence I wear away  Each tedious night each sad revolving day  I fast I pray and with deceitful art  Veil thy dear image from my tortur'd heart  My tortur'd heart conflicting passions move  I hope despair repentyet still I love  A thousand jarring thoughts my bosom tear  For thou not God O Eloise art there  To the false world's deluding pleasures dead  Nor longer by its wandering fires misled  In learn'd disputes harsh precepts I infuse  And give that counsel I want power to use  The rigid maxims of the grave and wise  Have quench'd each milder sparkle of my eyes  Each lovely feature of this wellknown face  By grief revers'd assumes a sterner grace  O Eloisa should the fates once more  Indulgent to my view thy charms restore  How wouldst thou from my arms with horror start  To miss the form familiar to thy heart  Nought could thy quick thy piercing judgment see  To speak thy Abelardbut love of thee  Lean abstinence pale grief and haggard care  The dire attendants of forlorn despair  Have Abelard the young the gay remov'd  And in the hermit sunk the man you lov'd  Wrapt in the gloom these holy mansions shed  The thorny paths of penitence I tread  Lost to the world from all its interests free  And torn from all my soul held dear in thee  Ambition with its train of frailties gone  All love all forms forgot but thine alone  Amid the blaze of day the dusk of night  My Eloisa rises to my sight  Veil'd as in Paraclete's secluded towers  The wretched mourner counts the lagging hours  I hear her sighs see the swiftfalling tears  Weep all her griefs and pine with all her cares  O vows O convents your stern force impart  And frown the melting phantom from my heart  Let other sighs a worthier sorrow show  Let other tears for sin repentant flow  Low to the earth my guilty eyes I roll  And humble to the dust my contrite soul  Forgiving power thy gracious call I meet  Who first impower'd this rebel heart to beat  Who thro' this trembling this offending frame  For nobler ends diffus'd life's active flame  O change the temper of this labouring breast  And form anew each beating pulse to rest  Let springing grace fair faith and hope remove  The fatal traces of destructive love  Destructive love from its warm mansion tear  And leave no tracks of Eloisa there  Are these the wishes of my inmost soul  Would I its softest tenderest sense controul  Would I this touch'd this glowing heart refine  To the cold substance of that marble shrine  Transform'd like these pale swarms that round me move  Of blest insensibleswho know not love  Ah rather let me keep this hapless flame  Adieu false honour unavailing fame  Not your harsh rules but tender love supplies  The streams that gush from my despairing eyes  I feel the traitor melt around my heart  And thro' my veins with treacherous influence dart  Inspire me heaven assist me grace divine  Aid me ye saints unknown to crimes like mine  You who on earth serene all griefs could prove  All but the torturing pangs of hopeless love  A holier rage in your pure bosoms dwelt  Nor can you pity what you never felt  A sympathizing grief alone can cure  The hand that heals must feel what I endure  Thou Eloise alone canst give me ease  And bid my struggling soul subside to peace  Restore me to my longlost heaven of rest  And take thyself from my reluctant breast  If crimes like mine could an allay receive  That blest allay thy wonderous charms must give  Thy form that first to love my heart inclin'd  Still wanders in my lost my guilty mind  I saw thee as the newblown blossoms fair  Sprightly as light and soft as summer's air  Bright as their beams thy eyes a mind disclose  While on thy lips gay blush'd the fragrant rose  Wit youth and beauty in each feature shone  Press'd by my fate I gaz'dand was undone  There died the generous fire whose vigorous flame  Enlarg'd my soul and urg'd me on to fame  Nor fame nor wealth my soften'd heart could move  My heart insensible to all but love  Snatch'd from myself my learning tasteless grew  Vain my philosophy oppos'd to you  A train of woes succeed nor should we mourn  The hours which cannot ought not to return  As once to love I sway'd thy yielding mind  Too fond alastoo fatally inclin'd  To virtue now let me thy breast inspire  And fan with zeal divine the holy fire  Teach thee to injur'd heaven allchang'd to turn  And bid thy soul with sacred raptures burn  O that my own example could impart  This noble warmth to thy soft trembling heart  That mine with pious undissembled care  Might aid the latent virtue struggling there  Alas I rave nor grace nor zeal divine  Burns in a breast o'erwhelm'd with crimes like mine  Too sure I find while I the tortures prove  Of feeble piety conflicting love  On black despair my forc'd devotion built  Absence to me has sharper pangs than guilt  Ah yet my Eloise your charms I view  Yet breathe my sighs my tears yet pour for you  Each weak resistance stronger knits my chain  I sigh weep love despair repentin vain  Haste Eloisa haste your lover free  Amidst your warmer prayers O think of me  Wing with your rising zeal my groveling mind  And let me mine from your repentance find  Ah labour strive your love yourself controul  The change will sure affect my kindred soul  In blest consent our purer sighs shall grieve  And heaven assisting shall our crimes forgive  But if unhappy wretched lost in vain  Faintly th' unequal combat you sustain  If not to heaven you feel your bosom rise  Nor tears refin'd fall contrite from your eyes  If still your heart its wonted passions move  If still to speak all pains in oneyou love  Deaf to the weak essays of living breath  Attend the stronger eloquence of death  When that kind power this captive soul shall free  Which only then can cease to doat on thee  When gently sunk to my eternal sleep  The Paraclete my peaceful urn shall keep  Then Eloisa then your lover view  See his quench'd eyes no longer fix'd on you  From their dead orbs that tender utterance flown  Which first to yours my heart's soft tale made known  This breast no more at length to ease consign'd  Pant like the waving aspin in the wind  See all my wild tumultuous passions o'er  And you amazing change belov'd no more  Behold the destin'd end of human love  But let the sight your zeal alone improve  Let not your conscious soul to sorrow mov'd  Recal how much how tenderly I lov'd  With pious care your fruitless grief restrain  Nor let a tear your sacred veil profane  Nor even a sigh on my cold urn bestow  But let your breast with newborn raptures glow  Let love divine frail mortal love dethrone  And to your mind immortal joys make known  Let heaven relenting strike your ravish'd view  And still the bright the blest pursuit renew  So with your crimes shall your misfortunes cease  And your rack'd soul be calmly hush'd to peace  ROSAMOND TO HENRY  AN EPISTLE  BY THE SAME  Qualis populeâ moerens

Henry's softer hours  What tender strains of passion can impart  The pangs of absence to an amorous heart  Far far too faint the powers of language prove  Language that slow interpreter of love  Souls pair'd like ours like ours to union wrought  Converse by silent sympathy of thought  O then by that mysterious art divine  The wild impatience of my breast by thine  And to conceive what I would say to thee  Conceive my love what thou wouldst say to me  As in the tenderness of soul I sigh  Methinks I hear thy tender soul reply  And as in thought o'er heaps of heroes slain  I trace thy progress on the fatal plain  Perhaps thy thought explores me thro' the grove  And softening steals an interval of love  In the deep covert of a bowering shade  Describes my posturelanguishingly laid  Now sadly solac'd with the murmuring springs  Now melting into tears the softest things  And how the feign'd ideas all agree  So bowers the shade so melt my tears for thee  Here as in Eden once we blissful lay  How oft night stole unheeded on the day  Our softbreath'd raptures charm'd the listening grove  And all was harmony for all was love  But hark the trumpet sounds see discords rise  'Tis honour calls from me my Henry flies  Honour to him more bright than Rosamonda's eyes  Not thus my honour with his passion strove  His sighs I pitied and indulg'd his love  He then cried "honour was an empty name  " And love a sweeter recompence than fame"  Oh had I liv'd in some obscure retreat  Securely fair and innocently sweet  How had I bless'd some humble shepherd's arms  How kept my fame as spotless as my charms  Then hadst thou ne'er beheld these eyes of mine  Nor they bewail'd the fatal power of thine  Dear fatal power to me for ever dear  Fix'd in my tender breast and rooted there  For ever in my tender breast remain  And be for ever a delightful pain  With what surprize those glories first I view'd  That in one moment my whole heart subdued  With such resistless beams so fierce they shone  Not such the dazzling radiance of thy crown  Sent from thy crown I never felt a dart  The lover not the monarch won my heart  Nor e'er the monarch with such charms appears  As when the lover's soften'd dress he wears  As when he silent deigns my breast to seek  And looks such language as no tongue can speak  Whene'er my crimes if love a crime can be  If 'tis a crime to live and die for thee  In hideous forms arise and cloud my soul  One thought of Henry can that gloom controul  No more my breast alternate passions move  The frosts of honour melt before the fires of love  Again I must repeat that fatal hour  Which snatch'd my Henry from his Woodstock bower  When mad Bellona with tumultuous cries  The hero rouz'd and drown'd the lover's sighs  Stretch'd on my downy couch at ease I lay  And sought by reading to beguile the day  With amorous strains I sooth'd a grateful fire  And all the woman glow'd with soft desire  'Till as I wish'd I heard the vocal breeze  Proclaim my Henry rustling thro' the trees  O'erjoy'd I ran to meet thy longing arms  And taste a dear remembrance of thy charms  But soon I saw some sad conceal'd surprize  Fade on thy cheeks and languish on thine eyes  Thro' each dissembled smile a sorrow stole  And whisper'd out the secret of thy soul  What this could mean uncertain to divine  No fault I knew yet fear'd some fault was mine  But soon thy love dispell'd those airy fears  Dispell'd alasbut brought too solid cares  For as with hands entwin'd in hands we walk'd  Of Love and hapless lovers still thou talk'd  Thy tears of pity answer'd each sad moan  And in their seeming miseries wept thy own  " I cannot leave her"I o'erheard thee say  Pierc'd to the soul I sunk and died away  What art restor'd me thou alone canst tell  For thy kind arms embrac'd me as I fell  My opening eyes fix'd on thy beauties hung  And my ears drank the cordial of thy tongue  Again my thoughts return with killing pain  Within thy arms I sink and swoon again  Again thou dost my sweet physician prove  From death to life alternately I move  Now dead by anguish now reviv'd by love  But when without disguise the truth I found  My agonizing sorrows knew no bound  My locks I tore then allintranc'd I lay  'Till by degrees my grief to words gave way  And soft I cried"oh stay my Henry stay  " One moment moreadd yetand yet a kiss  " Oh give me thine and take my soul in this  " Farewellperhaps farewell for everoh  " Who can sustain so dire a weight of woe"  Ah wretched maidalas a maid no more  No herbs that spotless title can restore  Ah who shall now protect thy injur'd fame  Who shield thy weakness from th' assaults of shame  Who lull thy anxious soul to balmy rest  If Henry dearest Henry flies thy breast  Yet tho' he flies your wings ye angels spread  And hover guardians o'er my Henry's head  Who knows but this kind prayer is pour'd too late  And he already struggles with his fate  Already wounded pants and gasps in death  And Rosamonda is his latest breath  Propitious heaven vouchsafe a gracious ear  Grant these be only phantoms of my fear  Heaven still is gracious if true suppliants pray  And lothe foul chimeras fleet away  Transporting prospects to my wishes rise  Beam on my soul and brighten in my eyes  He lives he lives I see his banner spread  And laurels wreath'd round the gay victor's head  Ye winds convey the news to Albion's floods  Ye floods resound it to the joyous woods  Ye joyous woods your tuneful choirs prepare  To hail my hero from the toils of war  Delusive scenes too beautiful to stay  They fade in visionary streaks away  Alas no lovely Henry now is nigh  His genius took his form to sooth my eye  No more I seem his melting voice to hear  Peace babbling fountains nor abuse my ear  Ye flowers ye streams ye gales no longer move  For ah how strong is fancy join'd with love  O frail inconstancy of mortal state  One hour dejected and the next elate  Rais'd by false hopes or by false fears deprest  How different passions sway the human breast  Now smiling pleasures with fair charms invite  Now frowning horrors with black trains affright  Future distrusts the present joys controul  And fancy triumphs o'er the reasoning soul  As 'mid the trees I solitary rove  The trees awake some image of my love  Wheree'er their arms in amorous foldings join  My longing arms I spread to fold in thine  The beauteous flowers thy face reflected bear  If flowers in beauty may with thee compare  Their wafted fragrancies thy breath inspire  And my soul kindles with ideal fire  The thickweav'd shades and grove in circling grove  Are emblems of th' eternity of love  My blushing guilt the crimson roses paint  And I like roses unsupported faint  Like theirs my youthful charms if charms consume  For love a closer canker eats my bloom  How blest might other nymphs survey these scenes  Fountains and shades and hills and flowery greens  Prospects on prospects might detain the sight  And still variety give new delight  But I with thee should find in deserts ease  Without thee not even Paradise could please  Wilds by thy presence gardens would appear  Gardens are wilds since Henry is not here  Let grottos sink or porticos arise  Heedless I view them with unpleasur'd eyes  Their mantling umbrage cools the noonday fire  But what can cool a lover's fierce desire  In the deep bosom of a darksome shade  By baleful yew and mournful cypress made  A widowturtle weeps her ravish'd love  And sorrowfully solaces the grove  Sometimes my passion I aloud disclose  The widow'd turtle answering cooes her woes  Bred by my hand my sorrow's sad relief  A little linnet learns to sigh my grief  Taught by my voice and by obedience tame  The pretty lisper whistles Henry's name  Perch'd on my head the sylvan syren sings  And tunes the harsher notes of gurgling springs  Embosom'd in a vale thou know'st the shade  Fast by the murmurs of a soft cascade  There while one night full beams of Cynthia play  Warm was the night with wanderings tir'd I lay  Till by degrees the falling waters clos'd  My eyelids and my wearied limbs repos'd  Sudden the fairy monarch I behold  Near he approach'd and thus my fate foretold  'Twas the same Oberon that once we saw  Circle the green and give his dancers law  " Unhappy nymph thy beauty is thy crime  " And must such beauty perish in its prime  " No more great Henry shall enjoy those charms  " Nor thou illfated fair adorn his arms  " Cropt like an opening rose thy fall I fear  " But rise and supplicate the vengeance near"  Then as methought I wak'd with threaten'd woes  Emerging from thick shades a phantom rose  One hand sustain'd a short but naked sword  And one a golden bowl with poison stor'd  The jealous queen the frowning form express'd  It spoke and aim'd the dagger at my breast  " Arise nor ask thy crimebut chuse thy fate  " Know prayers are vainrepentance is too late  " Vengeance is mine Here drink this poison'd bowl  " Or this keen dagger drinks thy guilty soul"  It ceas'd convulsions in my bosom strove  My curdling blood scarce in stiff tides could move  Thrice I cried "Henry" with a feeble sound  And thrice I started at the sad rebound  Even echo now grew frightful with surprize  Trembling I lay nor dar'd unveil my eyes  'Till warbling birds proclaim'd the morning light  And told me 'twas a vision of the night  Yet not the morn could chace my gloomy care  But winds and trees alarm'd my soul with fear  While waving boughs that in the sunbeams play'd  Seem'd to show daggers in each pointed shade  Why was I form'd with such a coward mind  The sport of shadows or a rustling wind  Nerves better strung did manly spirits warm  Glad would I part with every female charm  Then cas'd in steel the front of battle dare  And with great Henry rouze the soul of war  This arm should guard the hero from the foe  Repel the storm or intercept the blow  And should my weakness in the warrior fail  The softbeseeching woman should prevail  For thee I'd sooth each proud insulting foe  And melt him with petitionary woe  With thee in every hardy hazard join  In dangers save thy life to make it mine  By night compose thy harrass'd head to rest  And hush it on the pillow of my breast  With patient eyes eternal vigils keep  And court good angels to protect thy sleep  Alas in vain I urge my frustrate will  I find myself a feeble woman still  The feeble woman to my breast returns  For Henry's gone and Rosamonda mourns  O see my eyes their streaming anguish pour  O hear my sighs increase the swelling shower  What can I more than shed my tears and sighs  Poor woman's strength alone in weakness lies  But whither is ungovern'd fancy flown  Thoughts of impossibilities be gone  Guilt claims no miracles nor heaven conspires  To aid my crimes and fan my lawless fires  Life irksome grows detested is the light  And my soul dreads the visions of the night  Swift let me to some hallow'd convent go  Can I for ever Henry leaveah no  But O lost innocenceI lost a name  O honourbroken is the bubble fame  Are my sins monstrous do invented crimes  Alike unknown to past or present times  Demand red vengeance some peculiar curse  Crowds stand recorded for the sameor worse  Have I unpitying heard the poor complain  Or seen the wretched weep and weep in vain  Have I my flame feign'd for a sordid end  E'er wrong'd a foe or e'er betray'd a friend  Not to my charge such crimes has malice brought  Love only love is my unbounded fault  A fault that sure may heaven to pity move  Since half of heaven 'tis said consists in love  Ah foolish nymphHere view the queen the laws  But there view Henry as th' enchanting cause  By such a cause the priestess would retire  And quit the vestal for a nobler fire  I will again th' immortal powers implore  Brave Henry for Britannia's sake restore  In him she lives to him her joys are due  And only sends her earliest thanks to you  But O my lord my darling lord beware  Tempt not too bold the dangers of the war  Think when thou seest the fateimpelling dart  O think it aim'd at Rosamonda's heart  Were but each breast as soft as mine no more  Should tumults rise or martial thunders roar  Heroes should scorn the glories of the field  And the fam'd laurel to the myrtle yield  For sweeter passions sweeter strifes inspire  And love alone should set the soul on fire  May then these eyes in tears no longer mourn  But cheerful hail their Henry's wish'd return  O swift victorious hush the war's alarms  Swift if thy Rosamonda boasts some charms  Fly on the wings of love and conquest to her arms  HENRY TO ROSAMOND  AN EPISTLE  BY THE SAME  SHall then his beauteous Rosamonda mourn  Nor Henry's soul the soft complaint return  O cease my fair I deeply feel thy smart  And all thy sorrows double in my heart  Far from my breast ye scenes of war remove  Far from my breast be every scene but love  Soft rising thoughts as when in Woodstockbowers  Joyful we lov'd away the laughing hours  Now midnight rest relieves the soldier's care  Hush'd are the drums and every voice of war  Faint gleam the fires along the dewy field  And faint the noise that sleeping coursers yield  Yet love the lordly tyrant of my breast  Alarms my soul and interrupts my rest  In vain a nation's cares the monarch move  For ah far greater is the monarch love  Warm from my lips thy tender letter lies  And every word is magic to my eyes  Weeping I read and hear thy softbreath'd woes  And all the warrior in the lover lose  Then I by fancy vanish'd joys restore  Feast on false love and act part pleasures o'er  Fancy can sooth my soul with pleasing dreams  While tented Gallia bowery Woodstock seems  Led by delusive steps in thought I rove  Thro' well known greens and every winding grove  There haply on some flowery bank reclin'd  My sweetreposing Rosamonda find  When thou for then thy secret thoughts I see  In pious slumbers breath'st thy soul to me  Dissolv'd with joy and feasting on thy charms  I clasp thee in imaginary arms  And thenah thenI seem sincerely blest  Then only Rosamonda knows the rest  O glories empires crowns how weak ye prove  If thus outrivall'd by a dream of love  O love what joys thy real sweets bestow  When even their shadows can transport me so  O bliss extatic blest relief from cares  Thus let me lose my soul in softer wars  Be love's transporting sighs my sweet alarms  Nor worlds but Rosamonda crown my arms  In her alone my full desires agree  Her charms are empires glories all to me  ABELARD TO ELOISA  BY THE LATE MR CAWTHORNE MASTER OF TUNBRIDGESCHOOL  ARGUMENT  Abelard and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth century they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion After a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion It was many years after this separation that a letter of Abelard's to a friend which contained the history of his misfortunes fell into the hands of Eloisa this occasioned those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion  MR POPE  AH why this boding start this sudden pain  That wings my pulse and shoots from vein to vein  What mean regardless of yon midnight bell  These earthborn visions saddening o'er my cell  What strange disorder prompts these thoughts to glow  These sighs to murmur and these tears to flow  'Tis she 'tis Eloisa's form restor'd  Once a pure saint and more than saints ador'd  She comes in all her killing charms confest  Glares thro' the gloom and pours upon my breast  Bid heaven's bright guard from Paraclete remove  And drags me back to misery and love  Enjoy thy triumphs dear illusion see  This sad apostate from his God to thee  See at thy call my guilty warmths return  Flame thro' my blood and steal me from my urn  Yet yet frail Abelard one effort try  Ere the last lingering spark of virtue die  The deadly charming sorceress controul  And spite of nature tear her from thy soul  Long has that soul in these unsocial woods  Where anguish muses and where horror broods  From love's wild visionary wishes stray'd  And sought to lose thy beauties in the shade  Faith dropt a smile devotion lent her fire  Woke the keen pang and sanctified desire  Led me enraptur'd to the blest abode  And taught my heart to glow with all its God  But oh how weak fair faith and virtue prove  When Eloisa melts away in love  When her fond soul impassion'd rapt unveil'd  No joy forgotten and no wish conceal'd  Flows thro' her pen as infant softness free  And fiercely springs in ecstasies to me  Ye heavens as walking in yon sacred fane  With every seraph warm in every vein  Just as remorse had rous'd an aking sigh  And my torn soul hung trembling in my eye  In that kind hour thy fatal letter came  I saw I gaz'd I shiver'd at the name  The conscious lamps at once forgot to shine  Prophetic tremors shook the hallow'd shrine  Priests censers altars from thy genius fled  And heaven itself shut on me while I read  Dear smiling mischief art thou still the same  The still pale victim of too soft a flame  Warm as when first with more than mortal shine  Each melting eyeball mix'd thy soul with mine  Have not thy tears for ever taught to flow  The glooms of absence and the pangs of woe  The pomp of sacrifice the whisper'd tale  The dreadful vow yet hovering o'er thy veil  Drove this bewitching fondness from thy breast  Curb'd the loose wish and form'd each pulse to rest  And canst thou still still bend the suppliant knee  To love's dead shrine and weep and sigh for me  Then take me take me lock me in thy arms  Spring to my lips and give me all thy charms  No fly me fly me spread th' impatient sail  Steal the lark's wing and mount the swiftest gale  Skim the last ocean freeze beneath the pole  Renounce me curse me root thee from thy soul  Fly fly for justice bares the arm of God  And the grasp'd vengeance only waits his nod  Are these my wishes can they thus aspire  Does phrenzy form them or does grace inspire  Can Abelard in hurricanes of zeal  Betray his heart and teach thee not to feel  Teach thy enamour'd spirit to disown  Each human warmth and chill thee into stone  Ah rather let my tenderest accents move  The last wild tumults of unholy love  On that dear bosom trembling let me lie  Pour out my soul and in fierce raptures die  Rouze all my passions act my joys anew  Farewell ye cells ye martyr'd saints adieu  Sleep conscience sleep each awful thought be drown'd  And sevenfold darkness veil the scene around  What means this pause this agonizing start  This glimpse of heaven quickrushing thro' my heart  Methinks I see a radiant cross display'd  A wounded saviour bleeds along the shade  Around th' expiring God bright angels fly  Swell the loud hymn and open all the sky  O save me save me ere the thunders roll  And hell's black caverns swallow up my soul  Return ye hours when guiltless of a stain  My strongplum'd genius throb'd in every vein  When warm'd with all th' Aegyptian fanes inspir'd  All Athens boasted and all Rome admir'd  My merit in its full meridian shone  Each rival blushing and each heart my own  Return ye scenes ah no from fancy fly  On time's stretch'd wing till each idea die  Eternal fly since all that learning gave  Too weak to conquer and too fond to save  To love's soft empire every wish betray'd  And left my laurels withering in the shade  Let me forget that while deceitful fame  Grasp'd her shrill trump and fill'd it with my name  Thy stronger charms impower'd by heaven to move  Each saint each blest insensible to love  At once my soul from bright ambition won  I hugg'd the dart I wish'd to be undone  No more pale science durst my thoughts engage  Insipid dulness hung on every page  The midnight lamp no more enjoy'd its blaze  No more my spirit flew from maze to maze  Thy glances bade philosophy resign  Her throne to thee and every sense was thine  But what could all the frosts of wisdom do  Oppos'd to beauty when it melts in you  Since these dark cheerless solitary caves  Deathbreathing woods and dailyopening graves  Misshapen rocks wild images of woe  For ever howling to the deeps below  Ungenial deserts where no vernal shower  Wakes the green herb or paints th' unfolding flower  Th' imbrowning glooms these holy mansions shed  The nightborn horrors brooding o'er my bed  The dismal scenes black melancholy pours  O'er the sad visions of enanguish'd hours  Lean abstinence wan grief lowthoughted care  Distracting guilt and hell's worst fiend despair  Conspire in vain with all the aids of art  To blot thy dear idea from my heart  Delusive sightless god of warm desire  Why would'st thou wish to set a wretch on fire  Why lives thy soft divinity where woe  Heaves the pale sigh and anguish loves to glow  Fly to the mead the daisypainted vale  Breathe in its sweets and melt along the gale  Fly where gay scenes luxurious youths employ  Where every moment steals the wing of joy  There may'st thou see low prostrate at thy throne  Devoted slaves and victims all thy own  Each villageswain the turfbuilt shrine shall raise  And kings command whole hecatombs to blaze  O memory ingenious to revive  Each fleeting hour and teach the past to live  Witness what conflicts this frail bosom tore  What griefs I suffer'd and what pangs I bore  How long I struggled labour'd strove to save  An heart that panted to be still a slave  When youth warmth rapture spirit love and flame  Seiz'd every sense and burnt thro' all my frame  From youth warmth rapture to these wilds I fled  My food the herbage and the rock my bed  There while these venerable cloisters rise  O'er the bleak surge and gain upon the skies  My wounded soul indulg'd the tear to flow  O'er all her sad vicissitudes of woe  Profuse of life and yet afraid to die  Guilt in my heart and horror in my eye  With ceaseless prayers the whole artillery given  To win the mercies of offended heaven  Each hill made vocal echoed all around  While my torn breast knock'd bleeding on the ground  Yet yet alas tho' all my moments fly  Stain'd by a tear and darken'd in a sigh  Tho' meagre fasts have on my cheek display'd  The dusk of death and sunk me to a shade  Spite of myself the stillimpoisoning dart  Shoots thro' my blood and drinks up all my heart  My vows and wishes wildly disagree  And grace itself mistakes my God for thee  Athwart the glooms that wrap the midnight sky  My Eloisa steals upon my eye  For ever rises in the solar ray  A phantom brighter than the blaze of day  Wheree'er I go the visionary guest  Pants on my lip or sinks upon my breast  Unfolds her sweets and throbbing to destroy  Winds round my heart in luxury of joy  While loud hosannas shake the shrines around  I hear her softer accents in the sound  Her idolbeauties on each altar glare  And heaven muchinjur'd has but half my prayer  No tears can drive her hence no pangs controul  For every object brings her to my soul  Last night reclining on yon airy steep  My busy eyes hung brooding o'er the deep  The breathless whirlwinds slept in every cave  And the soft moonbeam danc'd from wave to wave  Each former bliss in this bright mirror seen  With all my glories dawn'd upon the scene  Recall'd the dear auspicious hour anew  When my fond soul to Eloisa flew  When with keen speechless ecstasies opprest  Thy frantic lover snatch'd thee to his breast  Gaz'd on thy blushes arm'd with every grace  And saw the goddess beaming in thy face  Saw thy wild trembling ardent wishes move  Each pulse to rapture and each glance to love  But lo the winds descend the billows roar  Foam to the clouds and burst upon the shore  Vast peals of thunder o'er the ocean roll  The flamewing'd lightning gleams from pole to pole  At once the pleasing images withdrew  And more than horrors crouded on my view  Thy uncle's form in all his ire array'd  Serenely dreadful stalk'd along the shade  Pierc'd by his sword I sunk upon the ground  The spectre ghastly smil'd upon the wound  A group of black infernals round me hung  And toss'd my infamy from tongue to tongue  Detested wretch how impotent thy age  How weak thy malice and how kind thy rage  Spite of thyself inhuman as thou art  Thy murdering hand has left me all my heart  Left me each tender fond affection warm  A nerve to tremble and an eye to charm  No cruel cruel exquisite in ill  Thou thought'st it dull barbarity to kill  My death had robb'd lost vengeance of her toil  And scarcely warm'd a Scythian to a smile  Sublimer furies taught thy soul to glow  With all their savage mysteries of woe  Taught thy unfeeling poniard to destroy  The powers of nature and the source of joy  To stretch me on the racks of vain desire  Each passion throbbing and each wish on fire  Mad to enjoy unable to be blest  Fiends in my veins and hell within my breast  Aid me fair faith assist me grace divine  Ye martyrs bless me and ye saints refine  Ye sacred groves ye heavendevoted walls  Where folly sickens and where virtue calls  Ye vows ye altars from this bosom tear  Voluptuous love and leave no anguish there  Oblivion be thy blackest plume display'd  O'er all my griefs and hide me in the shade  And thou too fondly idoliz'd attend  While awful reason whispers in the friend  Friend did I say immortals what a name  Can dull cold friendship own so wild a flame  No let thy lover whose enkindling eye  Shot all his soul between thee and the sky  Whose warmths bewitch'd thee whose unhallow'd song  Call'd thy rapt ear to die upon his tongue  Now strongly rouze while heaven his zeal inspires  Diviner transports and more holy fires  Calm all thy passions all thy peace restore  And teach that snowy breast to heave no more  Torn from the world within dark cells immur'd  By angels guarded and by vows secur'd  To all that once awoke thy fondness dead  And hope pale sorrow's last sad refuge fled  Why wilt thou weep and sigh and melt in vain  Brood o'er false joys and hug th' ideal chain  Say canst thou wish that madly wild to fly  From yon bright portal opening in the sky  Thy Abelard should bid his God adieu  Pant at thy feet and taste thy charms anew  Ye heavens if to this tender bosom woo'd  Thy meer idea harrows up my blood  If one faint glimpse of Eloise can move  The fiercest wildest agonies of love  What shall I be when dazzling as the light  Thy whole effulgence flows upon my fight  Look on thyself consider who thou art  And learn to be an abbess in thy heart  See while devotion's evermelting strain  Pours the loud organ thro' the trembling fane  Yon pious maids each earthly wish disown  Kiss the dread cross and croud upon the throne  O let thy soul the sacred charge attend  Their warmths inspirit and their virtues mend  Teach every breast from every hymn to steal  The seraph's meekness and the seraph's zeal  To rise to rapture to dissolve away  In dreams of heaven and lead thyself the way  Till all the glories of the blest abode  Blaze on the scene and every thought is God  While thus thy exemplary cares prevail  And make each vestal spotless as her veil  Th' eternal spirit o'er thy cell shall move  In the soft image of the mystic dove  The longlost gleams of heavenly comfort bring  Peace in his smile and healing on his wing  At once remove affliction from thy breast  Melt o'er thy soul and hush her pangs to rest  O that my soul from love's curst bondage free  Could catch the transports that I urge to thee  O that some angel's more than magic art  Would kindly tear the hermit from his heart  Extinguish every guilty sense and leave  No pulse to riot and no sigh to heave  Vain fruitless wish still still the vigorous flame  Bursts like an earthquake thro' my shatter'd frame  Spite of the joys that truth and virtue prove  I feel but thee and breath not but to love  Repent in vain scarce wish to be forgiven  Thy form my idol and thy charms my heaven  Yet yet my fair thy nobler efforts try  Lift me from earth and give me to the sky  Let my lost soul thy brighter virtues feel  Warm'd with thy hopes and wing'd with all thy zeal  And when lowbending at the hallow'd shrine  Thy contrite heart shall Abelard resign  When pitying heaven impatient to forgive  Unbars the gates of light and bids thee live  Seize on th' auspicious moment ere it flee  And ask the same immortal boon for me  Then when these black terrific scenes are o'er  And rebel nature chills the soul no more  When on thy cheek th' expiring roses fade  And thy last lustres darken in the shade  When arm'd with quick varieties of pain  Or creeping dully slow from vein to vein  Pale death shall set my kindred spirit free  And these dead orbs forget to doat on thee  Some pious friend whose wild affections glow  Like ours in sad similitude of woe  Shall drop one tender sympathizing tear  Prepare the garland and adorn the bier  Our lifeless reliques in one tomb enshrine  And teach thy genial dust to mix with mine  Mean while divinely purg'd from every stain  Our active souls shall climb th' etherial plain  To each bright cherub's purity aspire  Catch all his zeal and pant with all his fire  There where no face the glooms of anguish wears  No uncle murders and no passion tears  Enjoy with heaven eternity of rest  For ever blessing and for ever blest  THE ORIGIN OF DOUBT  WHen Jove at first from nothing call'd forth all  And various beings

beaming with dependent ray  As from the sun the light that gives the day  If all the vast immensity of space  Is fill'd with beings of an endless race  Or if some narrower bounds the work confine  And why thus bounded love and power divine  Whence the deep shades of sin and sorrow came  And evil mingled with the general frame  Why spread the dark dominions of the grave  Or why I wish more virtue than I have  These secret things to none but Thee are known  Veil'd in the darkness that surrounds thy throne  O let my soul be still content to know  Thy love thy wisdom rules the world below  Secure my lot the blessing or the rod  To find a father where I trace the God  While hope by thee permitted looks on high  And as her portion meditates the sky  Safe in the path which terminates above  Secur'd from wandering while I walk by love  O brighter still illume the social flame  Thy shining image in my filial frame  By just gradation let my love ascend  All else my neighbours thou alone my friend  TO SIR HUMPHRY MACKWORH ON THE MINES LATE OF SIR CARBERY PRICE  BY THE LATE MR YALDEN  WHat spacious veins enrich the British soil  The various ores and skilful miner's toil  How ripening metals lie conceal'd in earth  And teeming Nature forms the wondrous birth  My useful verse the first transmits to fame  In numbers tun'd and no unhallow'd flame  O generous Mackworth could the muse impart  A labour worthy thy auspicious art  Like thee succeed in paths untrod before  And secret treasures of the land explore  Apollo's self should on the labour smile  And Delphos quit for Britain's fruitful isle  Where fair Sabrina flows around the coast  And aged Dovey in the ocean's lost  Her lofty brows unconquer'd Britain rears  And fenc'd with rocks impregnable appears  Which like the wellfix'd bars of nature show  To guard the treasures she conceals below  For Earth distorted with her pregnant womb  Heaves up to give the forming embryo room  Hence vast excrescencies of hills arise  And mountains swell to a portentous size  Louring and black the rugged coast appears  The sullen earth a gloomy surface wears  Yet all beneath deep as the centre shines  With native wealth and more than India's mines  Thus erring Nature her defects supplies  Indulgent oft to what her sons despise  Oft in a rude unfinish'd form we find  The noblest treasure of a generous mind  Thrice happy land from whose indulgent womb  Such unexhausted stores of riches come  By heaven belov'd form'd by auspicious fate  To be above thy neighbouring nations great  Its golden sands no more shall Tagus boast  In Dovey's flood his rivall'd empire's lost  Whose waters now a nobler fund maintain  To humble France and check the pride of Spain  Like Egypt's Nile the bounteous current shows  Dispersing blessings wheresoe'er it flows  Whose native treasure's able to repair  The long expences of our Gallic war  The antient Britons are a hardy race  Averse to luxury and slothful ease  Their necks beneath a foreign yoke ne'er bow'd  In war unconquer'd and of freedom proud  With minds resolv'd they lasting toils endure  Unmix'd their language and their manners pure  Wisely does nature such an offspring chuse  Brave to defend her wealth and slow to use  Where thirst of empire ne'er inflames their veins  Nor avarice nor wild ambition reigns  But low in mines they constant toils renew  And thro' the earth their branching veins pursue  As when some navy on th' Iberian coast  Chas'd by the winds is in the ocean lost  To Neptune's realms a new supply it brings  The strength design'd of European kings  Contending divers would the wreck regain  And make reprisals on the grasping main  Wild in pursuit they are endanger'd more  Than when they combated the storms before  The miner thus thro' perils digs his way  Equal to theirs and deeper than the sea  Drawing in pestilential steams his breath  Resolv'd to conquer tho' he combats death  Night's gloomy realms his pointed steel invades  The courts of Pluto and infernal shades  He cuts thro' mountains subterraneous lakes  Plying his work each nervous stroke he takes  Loosens the earth and the whole cavern shakes  Thus with his brawny arms the Cyclops stands  To form Jove's lightning with uplifted hands  The ponderous hammer with a force descends  Loud as the thunder which his art intends  And as he strikes with each resistless blow  The anvil yields and Aetna groans below  Thy fam'd inventions Mackworth most adorn  The miner's art and make the best return  Thy speedy sails and useful engines show  A genius richer than the mines below  Thousands of slaves unskill'd Peru maintains  The hands that labour still exhaust the gains  The winds thy slaves their useful succour join  Convey thy ore and labour at thy mine  Instructed by thy arts a power they find  To vanquish realms where once they lay confin'd  Downward my muse direct thy steepy flight  Where smiling shades and bounteous realms invite  I first of British bards invoke thee down  And first with wealth thy graceful temples crown  Thro' dark retreats pursue the winding ore  Search nature's depths and view her boundless store  The secret cause in tuneful measures sing  How metals first are fram'd and whence they spring  Whether the active sun with chymic flames  Thro' porous earth transmits his genial beams  With heat impregnating the womb of night  The offspring shines with its paternal light  On Britain's isle propitiously he shines  With joy descends and labours in her mines  Or whether urg'd by subterraneous flames  The earth ferments and flows in liquid streams  Purg'd from their dross the nobler parts refine  Receive new forms and with fresh beauties shine  Thus fluid parts unknowing how to burn  With cold congeal'd to solid metals turn  For metals only from devouring flame  Preserve their beauty and return the same  Both art and force the wellwrought mass disdains  And 'midst the fire its native form retains  Or whether by creation first they sprung  When yet unpois'd the world's great fabric hung  Metals the basis of the earth were made  The bars on which its fix'd foundation's laid  All second causes they disdain to own  And from th' Almighty's Fiat sprung alone  Nature in specious beds preserves her store  And keeps unmix'd the wellcompacted ore  The spreading root a numerous race maintains  Of branching limbs and farextended veins  Thus from its watery store a spring supplies  The lesser streams that round its fountain rise  Which bounding out in fair meanders play  And o'er the meads in different currents stray  Methinks I see the rounded metal spread  To be ennobled with our monarch's head  About the globe th' admired coin shall run  And make the circle of its parent sun  How are thy realms triumphant Britain blest  Enrich'd with more than all the distant west  Thy sons no more betray'd with hopes of gain  Shall tempt the dangers of a faithless main  Traffic no more abroad for foreign spoil  Supplied with richer from their native soil  To Dovey's flood shall numerous traders come  Employ'd to fetch the British bullion home  To pay their tributes to its bounteous shore  Returning laden with the Cambrian ore  Her absent fleet Potosi's race shall mourn  And wish in vain to see our sails return  Like misers heaping up their useless store  Starv'd with their wealth amidst their riches poor  Wheree'er the British banners are display'd  The suppliant nations shall implore our aid  Till thus compell'd the greater worlds confess  Themselves oblig'd and succour'd by the less  How Cambria's mines were to her offspring known  Thus sacred verse transmits the story down  Merlin a bard of the inspired train  With mystic numbers charm'd the British plain  Belov'd by Phoebus and the tuneful nine  His song was sacred and his art divine  As on Sabrina's fruitful banks he stood  His wonderous verse restrain'd the listening flood  The stream's bright Goddess rais'd her awful head  And to her cave the artful shepherd led  Her swiftdescending steps the youth pursues  And rich in ore the spacious mountain views  In beds distinct the wellrang'd metals lay  Dispersing rays and counterfeiting day  The silver shedding beams of orient light  Struck with too fierce a glare his aking sight  Like rising flames the ruddy copper show'd  And spread its blushes o'er the dark abode  Profuse of rays and with unrivall'd beams  The liquid silver flow'd in restless streams  Nor India's sparkling gems are half so bright  Nor waves above that shine with heavenly light  When thus the Goddess spake harmonious Youth  Rever'd for numbers fraught with sacred truth  Belov'd by heaven attend while I relate  The fix'd decree and dark events of fate  Conceal'd these treasures lie in nature's womb  For future times and ages yet to come  When many long revolving years are run  A hero shall ascend the British throne  Whose numerous triumphs shall Augusta grace  In arms renown'd ador'd for plenteous peace  Beneath his sway a generous youth shall rise  With virtues blest in happy councils wise  Rich with the spoils of learning's various store  Commanding arts yet still acquiring more  He with success shall enter this abode  And nature trace in paths before untrod  The smiling offspring from her womb remove  And with her entrails glad the realms above  O youth reserv'd by more auspicious fate  With fam'd improvements to oblige the state  By wars impoverish'd Albion mourns no more  Thy wellwrought mines forbid her to be poor  The earth thy great exchequer ready lies  Which all defect of failing funds supplies  Thou shalt a nation's pressing wants relieve  Not war can lavish more than thou canst give  This Mackworth fixes thy immortal name  The muse's darling and the boast of fame  No greater virtues on record shall stand  Than thus with arts to grace with wealth enrich the land  A POEM SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF A DEARLY BELOVED AND ONLY DAUGHTER WHO DIED IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF HER AGE  WROTE BY HER MOURNING FATHER  A Common theme a flattering muse may fire  To raise our passions tho' she sung for hire  And may our praises or our pity steal  By feigning transports which she does not feel  But when the song from native love proceeds  And paints the anguish of a heart that bleeds  The mourning muse exerts superior skill  And dips in tears th' inconsolable quill  Our bosoms then with rising sorrows glow  And grief spontaneous will from nature flow  Ah what is life that thoughtless wish of all  A drop of honey in a draught of gall  A half existence or a waking dream  A bitter fountain with a muddy stream  A tale a shadow a delusive sound  That's lost with mourning and with sorrow found  A fading landscape painted upon clay  The source of care and idol of a day  The sweet deluder of a restless mind  Which if 'twas lost how few would wish to find  Untimely thus the infantbudding rose  By some rude hand is cropt before it blows  Away the little soul of fragrance flies  And blooming beauty unregarded dies  Snatch'd from the parent stem where once it grew  Embalm'd in odours and the morning dew  Can I be dumb when Love and Nature cries  And I have lost the darling of my eyes  Tho' 'tis in vain to wish for her return  Yet all the ties of Nature bid me mourn  If thou canst still the unrelenting sea  And make the jarring elements agree  Or cause the tide to cease to ebb and flow  Or hinder the descent of hail and snow  If thou canst stop the thunder's dreadful roar  Or cause the billows not to lash the shore  If thou canst lull a hurricane to sleep  Then may thy words persuade me not to weep  O give me leave but to lament her fall  As David mourn'd for Jonathan and Saul  When on mount Gilboa O unhappy day  They to Philistia fell a shameful prey  Or if it may with innocence be done  As he lamented Absalom his son  When in the anguish of his soul he cried  " Would God my son I in thy place had died"  Then lend your aid if any such there be  That lov'd a child or mourn for one like me  Let your kind sighs with me in concert join  And add your sympathizing tears to mine  That may in streams to swelling rivers flow  Until those rivers to a deluge grow  But if there's none commiserates my case  And in no breast compassion finds a place  Let not your censures add to my concern  Nor slight the cause that moves me thus to mourn  If you are void of trouble free from pain  Add not to mine nor wonder I complain  I know the stroke is from the hand divine  To whom I may complain tho' not repine  Tho' I deplore my loss and wish it less  Yet I will kiss the rod and acquiesce  A Saviour's blood shall supersede my fears  And love paternal justify my tears  When Death at first besieg'd this little fort  The feeble outworks were the tyrant's sport  A fever made the first attack in form  And then convulsions took it soon by storm  Succours without were weak like those within  The guards were sickly and the walls were thin  In bad repair the gates and citadel  And then no wonder that so soon it fell  Death's icy hands the lovely fabric spoil'd  He got a victim but I lost my child  Five mournful days with trembling hand and heart  I play'd the whole artillery of art  Five nights I past in sorrow like the day  And almost mourn'd my own sad life away  But when the most that art could do was tried  Her lease of life was cancell'd and she died  " She died"the conscious whispering winds reply  And I unhappy father saw her die  I saw her dieCan I the deed forgive  How can I bear to say I didand live  Tho' long her reason suffer'd an eclipse  No sinful word proceeded from her lips  Tho' sore oppress'd with agonizing pain  She utter'd nothing indiscreet or vain  Which gives me hopes her soul was wash'd from sin  And grace abounding was at work within  Whilst nature yet maintain'd a doubtful strife  And death sat brooding on the verge of life  Even thenwhen all the hopes of life were fled  I and the angels waiting round her bed  They to conduct her to the realms of day  And I to weep to sigh to mourn to pray  I kiss'd her lips I wip'd her dying face  And took the father's and the nurse's place  With bleeding heart I heard her dying groans  And met with equal agony her moans  Each sigh was as a dagger in my heart  We knew we must but oh were loth to part  I mourn'd I wept I gave a loose to grief  And had recourse to all things for relief  But all in vainthe last effort I make  I gavebut oh she had not strength to take  Her fluttering pulse with intermission play'd  And then her heart its palpitation stay'd  And thus thro' all the forms of death she past  'Till with a sigh she gently breath'd her last  But who can paint the horror or the power  Of nature's conflict in so dark an hour  The wound was such that time can never heal  No balm can cure it and no art conceal  May that sad day be banish'd from the year  Or cloath'd in sable if it must appear  Or may the sun withdraw his beams at noon  And solid darkness veil the stars and moon  May all the sands be stagnant in the glass  And as that hour returns refuse to pass  All clocks be dumb and time forget to fly  And may all nature be as sad as I  Let mourning in its blackest dress appear  And she be never nam'd without a tear  Oh where are now those dear obedient hands  So pleas'd to execute my whole commands  Where are those feet so early taught to run  As lightning swift unwearied as the sun  Where now those arms that with such passion strove  To clasp my neck and stifle me with love  Where now those lips where mine were fond to dwell  Or where that breath that ravish'd with the smell  Where is that tongue whose prattle charm'd mine ears  Where fled the hopes of my declining years  Where is that face so pleasant when she smil'd  Or where's the woman acting in the child  Where those dear eyes that with such sweetness shone  Or rather where are all my comforts gone  Where is that heart so near to truth allied  That never disobey'dbut when she died  Where is that breast where virtue once did grow  As roses sweet and white as falling snow  They're buried all in the voracious grave  Where kings are levell'd with the meanest slave  The wise and great when there they make their bed  Are equall'd with the wretch that begs his bread  But there the wicked can no more oppress  And there the weary find a calm recess  And this does all my expectations crown  That I to her shall there go quickly down  Till then this hope shall mitigate my woe  And dry those tears that now profusely flow  That when by heaven's command I quit the stage  Bow'd down by time and quite fatigued with age  My bones shall rest in quiet by her side  Like a fond bridegroom sleeping by his bride  'Till the last day shall both to life restore  When Death shall die and Time shall be no more  This distant view does equal pleasure give  As now my soul is conscious that I live  And thou that once wast my delight and pride  In whom I hop'd to have a nurse and guide  When feeble age should bow my hoary head  And pain or sickness fix me to my bed  If I may guiltless call upon thy name  And ask a boon without incurring blame  Tho' thou art happy now amongst the blest  Indulge thy mourning father's last request  When some kind angel from this world below  Shall bring the news for sure the angels know  And shall to thee and kindred spirits tell  That mine has orders to forsake her shell  And be transplanted to the realms of light  Where faith and hope are swallow'd up in sight  Do thou with heavenly raptures meet my ghost  On th' utmost limits of that happy coast  And thence attend me to the throne of grace  To view my Saviour's reconciled face  And taste of joys ineffable and new  Till then my little saint adieu adieu  ON THE PHYSICAL CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF KING GEORGE THE SECOND  THro' grief to death men oft have stole  And baffled all the physic art  Dissection seldom found the hole  Or show'd before a broken heart  That this of royal George the case  With men can never gain belief  More like the opposite it was  Since joy can kill as well as grief  With length of years and glory crown'd  As blithe he view'd his valiant bands  Death dealing secretly the wound  From future conquests stopt his hands  " Enough of years enough of fame  " While thou didst wield the conquering sword"  Cries Death "Leave something to proclaim  " The worth and praise of George the third  " His be the glorious task to end  " And bid war's cruel horrors cease  " The freedom of mankind defend  " And bless a jarring world with peace"  JT  CORYDON A PASTORAL  TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE ESQ  BY J CUNNINGHAM  COme shepherds we'll follow the hearse  And see our lov'd Corydon laid  Tho' sorrow may blemish the verse  Yet let the sad tribute be paid  They call'd him the pride of the plain  In sooth he was gentle and kind  He mark'd in his elegant strain  The graces that glow'd in his mind  On purpose he planted yon trees  That birds in the covert might dwell  He cultur'd his thyme for the bees  But never once rifled their cell  Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet  Go bleatand your master bemoan  His music was artless and sweet  His manners as mild as your own  No verdure shall cover the vale  No bloom on the blossoms appear  The sweets of the forest shall fail  And winter encompass the year  No birds in our hedges shall sing  Our hedges so vocal before  Since he that should welcome the spring  Can greet the gay season no more  His Phillis was proud of his praise  And poets came round in a throng  They listen'dand envied his lays  But which of them equall'd the song  Ye shepherds henceforward be mute  For lost is the pastoral strain  So give me my Corydon's flute  And thuslet me break it in twain  MORNING  BY THE SAME  IN the barn the tenant cock  Close to Partlet perch'd on high  Briskly crows the shepherd's clock  And proclaims the morning nigh  Swiftly from the mountain's brow  Shadows nurs'd by night retire  And the peeping sunbeam now  Paints with gold the villagespire  Now the pinetree's waving top  Gently greets the morning gale  And the newwak'd kidlings crop  Daisies round the dewy vale  Philomel forsakes the thorn  Plaintive where she prates at night  And the lark to greet the morn  Soars beyond the shepherd's sight  From the claybuilt cottageridge  See the chattering swallow spring  Darting thro' the onearch'd bridge  Quick she dips her dappled wing  Lo the busy bees employ'd  Restless till their task be done  Now from sweet to sweet uncloy'd  Sipping dew before the sun  Trickling thro' the crevic'd rock  See the silver stream distill  Sweet refreshment for the flock  When 'tis sundrove from the hill  Ploughmen for the promis'd corn  Ripening o'er the banks of Tweed  Anxious hear the huntsman's horn  Soften'd by the shepherd's reed  Sweet oh sweet the warbling throng  On the white emblossom'd spray  All is music mirth and song  At the jocund dawn of day  NOON  BY THE SAME  FErvid now the sunbeam glows  Drinking deep the morning gem  Not a dewdrop's left the rose  To refresh her parent stem  By the brook the shepherd dines  From the fierce meridian heat  Shelter'd by the branching pines  Pendent o'er his grassy seat  See the flocks forsake the glade  Where uncheck'd the sunbeams fall  Sure to find a pleasing shade  By the ivy'd abbey wall  Echo in her airy round  O'er the river rock and hill  Cannot catch a single sound  Save the clack of yonder mill  Cattle court the breezes bland  Where the streamlet wanders cool  Or with languid silence stand  Midway in the marshy pool  But from mountain dell or stream  Not a fluttering zephyr springs  Fearful left the piercing beam  Scorch its soft its silken wings  Not a leaf has leave to stir  Nature's lull'd serene and still  Quiet even the shepherd's cur  Sleeping on the heathclad hill  Languid is the landscape round  Till the fresh descending shower  Kindly cools the thirsty ground  And revives each fainting flower  Now the hill the hedge is green  Now the warbler's throat's in tune  Blithsome is the vernal scene  Brighten'd by the beams of noon  EVENING  BY THE SAME  AS the plodding ploughman goes  Homeward to the hamlet bound  Giantlike his shadow grows  Lengthen'd o'er the level ground  O'er the mead the bullock strays  Freethe furrow'd task is done  And the village windows blaze  Burnish'd by the setting sun  Mark him from behind the hill  Strike the purplepainted sky  Can the pencil's mimic skill  Copy the refulgent dye  Where the rising forest spreads  Round the timedecaying dome  To their highbuilt airy beds  See the rooks returning home  As the lark with varied tune  Carrols to the evening loud  Mark the mild resplendent moon  Breaking thro' a parted cloud  Now the hermit howlet peeps  From the barn or twisted brake  And the curling vapour creeps  O'er the lillyborder'd lake  As the trout in speckled pride  Playful from its bosom springs  To the banks a ruffled tide  Verges in successive rings  Tripping thro' the silken grass  O'er the pathdivided dale  See the rosecomplexion'd lass  With the wellpois'd milkingpail  Linnets with unnumber'd notes  And the cuckoo bird with two  Tuning sweet their mellow throats  Bid the setting sun adieu  ON MAY  WROTE IN APRIL MDCCLXI  BY THE SAME  THE virgin when soften'd by May  Attends to the villager's vows  The birds sweetly bill on the spray  And poplars embrace with their boughs  On Ida bright Venus may reign  Ador'd for her beauty above  We shepherds that live on the plain  Hail May as the mother of love  From the west as it wantonly blows  Fond zephyr caresses the pine  The bee steals a kiss from the rose  And willows and woodbines entwine  The pinks by the rivulet's side  That border the vernal alcove  Bend downwards to kiss the soft tide  For May is the mother of love  May tinges the butterfly's wing  He flutters in bridal array  If the larks and the linnets now sing  Their music is taught them by May  The stockdove recluse with her mate  Conceals her fond bliss in the grove  And murmuring seems to repeat  That May is the mother of love  The goddess will visit you soon  Ye virgins be sportive and gay  Get your pipes oh ye shepherds in tune  For music must welcome the May  Would Damon have Phillis prove kind  And all his keen anguish remove  Let him tell a soft tale and he'll find  That May is the mother of love  CONTRASTE TO MRS CARTER'S ODE TO WISDOM  NOW see my goddess earthly born  With smiling looks and sparkling eyes  And with a bloom that shames the morn  New risen in the eastern skies  Furnish'd from nature's boundless store  A nymph of pleasure's laughing train  Stranger to all the wise explore  She proves all farsought knowledge vain  Untaught as Venus when she found  Herself first floating on the sea  And laughing begg'd the Tritons round  For shame to look some other way  And unaccomplish'd all as Eve  In the first morning of her life  When Adam blush'd and ask'd her leave  To take her hand and call her Wife  Yet there is something in her face  Tho' she's unread in Plato's lore  Might bring even Plato to disgrace  For leaving precepts taught before  And there is magic in her eye  Tho' she's unskill'd to conjure down  The pale moon from th' affrighted sky  Would draw Endymion from the moon  And there are words that she can speak  Most easy to be understood  More sweet than all the heathen Greek  By Helen talk'd when Paris woo'd  And she has raptures in her power  More worth than all the flattering claim  Of learning's unsubstantial dower  In present praise or future fame  Let me but kiss her soft warm hand  And let me whisper in her ear  What Knowledge would not understand  And Wisdom would disdain to hear  And let her listen to my tale  And let one smiling blush arise  Best omen that my vows prevail  I'll scorn the scorn of all the wise  ON THE ROYAL NUPTIALS  BY JOSEPH

holy love imprest  Was she not good as hope itself could form  Spoke not her open looks a spotless breast  She wasoh come Religion heavenly fair  Loose these dire bonds that fix us to the earth  Not what she was but what she is declare  And paint the glories of her second birth  Paint her ascending to th' etherial height  Where hymning saints her blest arrival greet  Paint her pure spirit clad in robes of light  With trembling joy before the mercyseat  Exhaustless splendor beams around the throne  While from the midst God's awful voice is heard  " Servant of God well done thy faith is known  " Eternal glories be the great reward"  Oh words of rapture which seraphic lyres  Harmonious catch and in their strains return  The stranger spirit glows with heavenly fires  And boundless joys within her bosom burn  A roselip'd angel Purity divine  Bright is her form and white her flowing vest  Around her beams celestial ceaseless shine  And those on whom she smiles are ever blest  Leads the young seraph to a glorious throne  Presents a golden harp and starry wreath  There ever shall she dwell in bliss unknown  There ever the Almighty's praises breathe  THE CIT'S COUNTRY BOX  THE wealthy cit grown old in trade  Now wishes for the rural shade  And buckles to his onehorse chair  Old Dobbin or the founder'd mare  While wedg'd in closely by his side  Sits madam his unwieldy bride  With Jacky on a stool before 'em  And out they jog in due decorum  Scarce past the turnpike half a mile  How all the country seems to smile  And as they slowly jog together  The cit commends the road and weather  While madam doats upon the trees  And longs for every house she sees  Admires its views its situation  And thus she opens her oration  " What signify the loads of wealth  " Without that richest jewel health  " Excuse the fondness of a wife  " Who doats upon your precious life  " Such ceaseless toil such constant care  " Is more than human strength can bear  " One may observe it in your face  " Indeed my dear you break apace  " And nothing can your health repair  " But exercise and country air  " Sir Traffick has a house you know  " About a mile from Cheney Row  " He's a good man indeed 'tis true  " But not so warm my dear as you  " And folks are always apt to sneer  " One would not be outdone my dear"  Sir Traffick's name so well applied  Awak'd his brother merchant's pride  And Thrifty who had all his life  Paid utmost deference to his wife  Confess'd her arguments had reason  And by th' approaching summer season  Draws a few hundreds from the stocks  And purchases his country box  Some three or four miles out of town  An hour completely brings you down  He fixes on his choice abode  Not half a furlong from the road  And so convenient does it lay  The stages pass it every day  And then so snug so mighty pretty  To have a house so near the city  Take but your places at the Boar  You're set down at the very door  Well then suppose 'em fix'd at last  Whitewashing painting scrubbing past  Hugging themselves in ease and clover  With all the fuss of moving over  Lo a new heap of whims are bred  And wanton in my lady's head  " Well to be sure it must be own'd  " It is a charming spot of ground  " So sweet a distance for a ride  " And all about so countrified  " 'Twould come to but a trifling price  " To make it quite a paradise  " I cannot bear those nasty rails  " Those ugly broken mouldy pales  " Suppose my dear instead of these  " We build a railing all Chinese  " Altho' one hates to be expos'd  " 'Tis dismal to be thus enclos'd  " Rural retirement pray d'ye term it  " Lard it is living like a hermit  " One hardly any object sees  " I wish you'd fell those odious trees  " 'Twould make a much more cheerful scene  " I'm tir'd with everlasting green  " Objects continual passing by  " Were something to amuse the eye  " But to be pent within the walls  " One might as well be at St Paul's  " Our house beholders would adore  " Was there a level lawn before  " Nothing its views to incommode  " But quite laid open to the road  " While every traveller in amaze  " Should on our little mansion gaze  " And pointing to the choice retreat  " Cry that's Sir Thrifty's countryseat"  No doubt her arguments prevail  For madam's taste can never fail  Blest age when all men may procure  The title of a connoisseur  When th' noble and ignoble herd  Are govern'd by a single word  Tho' like the royal German dames  It bears an hundred christian names  As Genius Fancy Judgment Goùt  Whim Caprice Je ne scai quoi Virtû  Which appellations all describe  Taste and the modern tasteful tribe  Now bricklayers carpenters and joiners  With Chinese artists and designers  Produce their schemes of alteration  To work this wond'rous reformation  The useful dome which secret stood  Embosom'd in the yewtrees wood  The traveller with amazement sees  Chang'd to a temple tout Chinese  With many a bell and tawdry ragon  And crested with a sprawling dragon  A wooden arch is bent astride  A ditch of water four feet wide  With angles curves and zigzag lines  From Halfpenny's exact designs  In front a level lawn is seen  Without a shrub upon the green  Where taste would want its first great law  But for the skulking sly HaHa  By whose miraculous assistance  You gain a prospect two fields distance  And now from Hydepark Corner come  The gods of Athens and of Rome  Here squabby Cupids take their places  With Venus and the clumsy Graces  Apollo there with aim so clever  Stretches his leaden bow for ever  And there without the power to fly  Stands fix'd a tiptoe Mercury  The villa thus compleatly grac'd  All own that Thrifty has a taste  And madam's female friends and cousins  With commoncouncilmen by dozens  Flock every Sunday to the seat  To stare about them and to eat  THE FALL OF CHLOE'S JORDAN  BY THE LATE MR JOHN PHILIPS AUTHOR OF CYDER A POEM  OF wasteful havock and destructive fate  I sing the tragic scene a mournful tale  Yet call no slaughtering hero to my aid  To strew my bloodless verse with mangled foes  A torrent spilt but not of human gore  Ruin deform'd but not of man erect  O heavenborn muse for muse I must invoke  Or mistress fair for fashion or for need  Deign to describe the memorable fall  Of Chloe's Jordan so by mortals nam'd  The vessel was howe'er uncouth the sound  But veil'd by modest maids in gentler terms  Like Rome the mistress of the world it fell  From its own greatness only not secure  Say first what colours stain'd its vaulted sides  Lest harmless bards mistake th' important truth  And speak as fancy leads or rhime directs  And he that terms it white as silver swans  And spotless innocence and newfallen snow  That spreads its plumes on Atlas bleaky head  Shall suffer blemish in the wrong compare  Another humorous sports and jeers its hue  Earthly and coarse of substance indigest  How oft are men by devious error led  To wander various wide alike from truth  A sicklypale languish'd on th' inner round  Such as betrays the want of lovesick maids  Foe to the rosy cheek and coral lip  But flies the lusty touch of warmer man  And beauty reassumes its native seat  Smooth were its sides but from the bottom rose  A manly head emboss'd for hero meant  No question fam'd for arms and antique stem  Such honours the wellmeaning vulgar pay  To fame of gallant men and waste their skill  On highhung signs and earth of homely hue  What blushes did the virile image cost  The harmless maid fearful lest so employ'd  The amorous stone should soften into life  As erst Pygmalion's marble mistress chang'd  Her Parian substance by less motive sway'd  Without the cerulous dye bestrew'd the urn  And on the swelling surface Flora's pride  The lilly and the gaudy tulip smil'd  Fed with the briny nectar it contain'd  One handle held the vessel arch'd and smooth  But for its weighty office far unfit  Here weakness lurk'd in comely form disguis'd  Hence the sad source and root of all our woe  Imprudent man too often trusts his fate  To one smooth friend who shrinks when nearly tried  The unsuspecting fairone never fail'd  At morn and eve to dew its spacious womb  At morn her first at eve her latest act  How often has it flow'd with maiden streams  Fam'd for rare virtues and but seldom found  'Twas with this magic stream Diana spread  The branchy horns on bold Actaeon's brow  The well e'ersince a secret power retains  On human foreheads antlers to convey  'Twas now the heavy period fix'd by fate  Hasten'd apace with evil mischief fraught  'Tis true no comet stream'd terrific blaze  Nor thundercrack sinistrous roar'd aloud  Not but a crazy sound gave certain proof  Of hidden crack foreboding wider wounds  Yet scap'd suspicion foresight ever fails  When unavoided ruin is decreed  The feeble sun array'd with lifeless flames  Inn'd at the bearded Goat and drove his car  Extinguish'd heavy half the tour of heaven  And winter keen of breath blew shivering cold  Around the globe and hid the voluble streams  Some to the chimney's warm protection fly  And fright the sooty earth with sooty tale  Of sprite nocturnal or adventurous knight  Some bid defiance to th' inclement air  Fir'd with the juicy flame of old Falern  Amidst a jovial crew fair Chloe quaff'd  With loud carouse till sated nature crav'd  Timely relax distent with liquid pain  Alone she lifts the Jordan to her aid  And strait a hideous din 'gan roar aloud  Wave dash'd on wave deluge on deluge rowl'd  And curl'd the circling eddy to the brim  Whole cataracts at once discharg'd fell down  With violent gush and drove the deep cascade  Till weary of its load the labouring urn  Flew from its hold a horrid burst ensues  And mangled limbs bestrew the bruised floor  Not louder roars the threeedg'd bolt of heaven  When form'd by Vulcan or when thrown by Jove  Forth from the hideous shreds a tepid sea  Rolls angry foam and smokes along the plain  Part of the stream with slow and silent pace  Sunk unobserv'd in narrow crannies lost  Part murmurs crowding at the portal wide  Which opes the mazy way that winding leads  To th' antient race of earth protected mice  The race exiguous uninur'd to wet  Their mansions quit and other countries seek  Thus fell the Jordan that had long withstood  Firm and resolv'd the shock of mighty waves  Which lost their strength and dash'd her shores in vain  Till at th' approach of one impetuous tide  Fate took th' occasion and confirm'd its doom  So the fam'd Edistone near Plymouth Fort  Sure mark to wandering ships and lost at night  Contemn'd the billows tumbling round its sides  And mock'd their sports till on a fatal night  The wind blew loud th' enraged ocean roar'd  And plung'd the Pharos in the vast abyss  DR CONYERS TO DR EVANS BURSAR ON CUTTING DOWN SOME FINE COLLEGETREES  INdulgent Nature to each kind bestows  A secret instinct to discern its foes  The timorous goose avoids the ravenous fox  Lambs fly from wolves and pilots shun the rocks  The rogue a gibbet as his fate foresees  And bears the like antipathy to trees  THE WANDERING BEAUTY  BY THE LATE MR JOHN HUGHES  THE graces and the wandering loves  Are fled to distant plains  To chase the fawns or in deep groves  To wound admiring swains  With their bright mistress there they stray  Who turns her careless eyes  From daily triumphs yet each day  Beholds new triumphs in her way  And conquers while she flies  But see implor'd by moving prayers  To change the lover's pain  Venus her harness'd doves prepares  And brings the fair again  Proud mortals who this maid pursue  Think you she'll e'er resign  Cease fools your wishes to renew  Till she grows flesh and blood like you  Or you like her divine  HYMN ON THE APPROACH OF MAY  QUeen of the laughing flower whose lovely waist  Fair Spring entwines with her brocaded zone  Array'd most gorgeous in thy rainbow vest  With joy descend from thy celestial throne  Bright on the skirt of yon cerulean cloud  In splendid majesty I see her sail  With lavish hand she fills the lap of earth  And with her breath perfumes the fanning gale  Now Flora puts her greenest mantle on  And Phoebus darts a more enlightning beam  Rearing his stately neck the silver swan  Floats lighter on the warm redundant stream  The streamredundant fed by gushing springs  Curls to the pressure of the tepid breeze  Feeling the force of renovated life  Nod the green summits of the neighbouring trees  Sits on its thorn the crimsonblushing rose  And smiles oh May to meet thy brilliant eye  Rude grows the lilly and unfolds its breast  White as the fleece that decks the vernal sky  The swallow twitters on the chimney top  The merry martin builds her plaited nest  And clos'd within the covert of the hedge  The loud thrush swells his manyspotted breast  Perch'd on yon slender pile of bavinwood  Too proud to mingle with the fowl below  Expands the peacock his eyeglittering tail  Still brighter as he waves it to and fro  In this soft season Cupid strings his bow  And aims his fatal arrows at the heart  Stung to the quick the virgin feels the wound  Yet nourishes the new the pleasing smart  In yonder mead the lusty rustic aids  The bonny milkmaid with her cleanly pail  And ever and anon he charms her air  With "lovely Bett" or "Nanny of the Vale"  In nature's artless language he reveals  True to the blushing maid his genuine flame  A lovelier hue adorns her comely face  How far more different is the blush of shame  The nymph approving of his love sincere  Consents the nuptial union shall be tied  The rites perform'd what extasies ensue  He the gay bridegroom she the happy bride  Peace guardian Peace sits smiling at their door  Wheree'er they walk Contentment marks the way  Constant Goodhumour cloaths their honest minds  And every morning of their life is May  ODE TO HEALTH  DAughter of Exercise at whose command  Mirth spreads a smile upon the cheek of Care  At whose rekindling breath  Sickness looks up and lives  Say where for much thy haunts I long to woo  Shall I thy joyinfusing presence hail  Amidst what sylvan scenes  Or unfrequented plains  Say when the roseate finger of the morn  Points out the glories of her shortliv'd reign  Shall I thy steps pursue  Climbing the mountain's side  From whose tall brow in eminence superb  Fair Nature views her fruitful vales below  While Phoebus darts around  His oriental eye  Or shall I trace thy vestige o'er the heath  Where in derision of the florist's aid  Shoots up untaught by art  The voluntary flower  For well 'tis known that oft upon the heath  In contemplation devious art thou seen  Or panting up the steep  Of unimprinted hill  Or when cool evening in her floating vest  Sweeps o'er the lawns diffusing shadowy pomp  And bids the sun recline  On Amphitrite'sbreast  I will attend thee to the solemn grove  Where love stands registred on every tree  Where the rook rocks his young  And Echo learns to caw  Or standing on the margent of the stream  I will survey thee on the passive wave  Then press the liquid bed  To meet thy naiad kiss  O tell me nymph thy chosen residence  Be it on mountain top or forest wild  And I will consecrate  A temple to thee there  A SONG FOR THE PARK AT HIGH MALL  BY A LADY  YE foplings and prigs and ye wou'dbesmart things  Who move in wide commerce's round  Pray tell me from whence this absurdity springs  All orders of rank to confound  What means the bagwig and the soldierlike air  On the tradesman obsequious and meek  Sure sabbaths were meant for retirement and prayer  To amend the past faults of the week  The youth to whom battles and dangers belong  May call a fierce look to his aid  Lace bluster and oaths and a sword an ell long  Are samples he gives of his trade  But you on whom London indulgently smiles  And whom counters should guard from all ills  Should slily invade with humility's wiles  Lest splendor deter us from bills  Old Gresham whose statue adorns the Exchange  Displays the true cit to our view  And silently frowns on a conduct so strange  So remote from your interests and you  Then learn from his gesture grave decent and plain  To copy fair Prudence's rules  For Frugality's garb will conceal your vast gain  And secure you the plunder of fools  The ease of a court and the air of a camp  Are graces no cit can procure  Vide Moliere's Gentleman Citizen  Mons Jourdain still trots in the Spittlefields tramp  Nor can Hart the grown aukwardness cure  Thus if apes of the fashion St James's you croud  Pressing onwards in spite of all stops  The Mall you may fill and be airy and loud  But trust me you'll ne'er fill your shops  VERSES WRITTEN IN A BLANK LEAF IN LORD ORRERY'S REMARKS ON THE LIFE OF DEAN SWIFT  BY THE SAME  HAil noble Critic whose pervading mind  The dazzling beams of genius cannot blind  Whose steady eye and equal hand detects  In spite of wit humanity's defects  O say what cause impell'd thee thus to scan  Foibles that shame the Dean and sink the man  The sacred veil whose texture genius wrought  To shade from public view each latent fault  Long consecrate its wondrous power retain'd  Tho' Envy rag'd and Faction stalk'd unchain'd  But what no foe had dar'd tho' malice fir'd  Thy cooler warmth O friendship hath inspir'd  For thee alone reserv'd the arduous task  Severely thus his errors to unmask  Ah hapless Swift whose nakedness of mind  Another Ham displays to all mankind  Arise and vindicate thy injur'd fame  Arise and curse the author of thy shame  Avenge this flagrant breach of friendship's rules  Change nature's laws and curse his race with fools  PROLOGUE TO THE GRATEFUL FAIR A COMEDY INTENDED FOR THE STAGE  BY MR SMART  IN antient days as jovial Horace sings  When laurell'd bards were lawgivers and kings  Bold was the comic muse without restraint  To name the vicious and the vice to paint  Th' enliven'd picture from the canvas flew  And the strong likeness crouded on the view  Our author practises more general rules  He is no niggard of his knaves and fools  Both small and great both dull and pert he shews  That every gentleman may pick and chuse  The laws dramatic tho' he scarcely knows  Of time and place and all the piteous prose  Which pedant Frenchmen snuffle thro' their nose  Foolswho prescribe what Homer should have done  Like tattling watches they correct the sun  Criticslike postsundoubtedly may show  The way to Pindusbut they cannot go  For to delight and elevate the mind  To heavendirected genius is assign'd  Whene'er immortal Shakespear's works we read  He wins the heart before he strikes the head  Swift to the soul the piercing image flies  More swift than Celia's wit or Celia's eyes  More swift than some romantic traveller's thought  More swift than British fire when William fought  Fancy precedes and conquers all the mind  Deliberating judgment slowly lags behind  Comes to the field with blunderbuss and gun  Like heavy Falstaff when the work is done  Fights when the battle's o'er with wondrous pain  By Shrewsbury clockand nobly slays the slain  But critic censures are beneath his care  Who strives to please the honest and the fair  Their approbation is much more than fame  He speakshe writeshe breathes notbut for them  ON MOTHER GRIFFITHS  THE race of critics till of late were grac'd  With reading learning judgment sense and taste  And none e'er dar'd usurp that noble name  But who as authors had establish'd fame  By envy never nor by spite misled  And tho' strict judges they were still wellbred  But now oh shame to Britain and the muse  Dame Griffiths writes her infamous Reviews  Who to no requisite can make pretence  Of learning genius judgment taste or sense  Yet with the rancour of a cursed elf  She damns all worksbut what she prints herself  Thus modern Methodists with foolish pride  Save their own sect and deem all damn'd beside  To coblerparsons weaverpriests succeed  And preach that Gospel which they cannot
