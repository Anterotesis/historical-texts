 A DISSERTATION ON THE RISE UNION and POWER THE Progressions Separations and Corruptions OF POETRY and MUSIC To which is prefixed The CURE of SAUL A SACRED ODE  Written by DR BROWN  Grata TistudoLaborum  Dulce Lenimen Mihi cungue salve  Rite vocanti  LONDON Printed for L DAVIS and C REYMERS against  Gray'sInn Holbourn  Printers to the ROYAL SOCIETY MDCCLXIII  Advertisement  The Relation which the following Ode and Dissertation bear to each other tho' perhaps not apparent at first Sight ren∣dered it necessary to publish them in this united Manner  THE ARGUMENT OF THE ODE  SAUL  for his Disobedience to Heaven is afflicted with the Fiend of  MELANCHOLY p DAVID  is sent for to cure him by the Power of Music  p  He comes attended with a Choir of Shepherds and as the means of dispelling  SAUL's  Despair he sings the Creation of the World and the happy Estate of our first Parents in Paradise  ib to SAUL  is moved by the Representation but expostulates with DAVID "why when others are happy He should be miserable"  p DAVID  to convince him that Guilt is the Source of Misery sings the Fall of Man and his Expulsion from Paradise  ib  This alarms the Monarch's Pride and instead of reclaiming provokes him to Resentment and Rage  p DAVID  superior to his Threats awakens his Conscience and terrifies him by singing the Fate and Punishment of Guilt in the Destruction of the rebellious Tribe of  CHORAH  by an Earthquake and of the guilty World by the general  Deluge  p SAUL  struck with Horror attempts to kill himself  p  But being prevented by his Friends  DAVID  sooths his Anguish by invoking Repentance and divine Mercy to compose his Passions  p SAUL  relents into virtuous Sorrow  p  But his Despair returning  DAVID  calls on his at∣tendant Choir to raise a more sublime and affecting Strain  p  This hath its Effect and  SAUL  melts into Tears of Penitence  ib DAVID  now comforts him with the Return of the divine Favour  p  To banish the Remains of Pride he then sings his own Happiness in the humble Station of a Shepherd  ib  Still farther to compose the Monarch's Griefs by a Strain of soft Music he throws him into a gentle Slumber invoking celestial visions to transport him to the Regions of the Blessed and change his Anguish into Joy  p  The desired Effects appear in his Countenance The Fiend departs And  SAUL  awakes in perfect Tranquillity  p DAVID  then con∣cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony and the seraphic Hymn that attended her as the Minister of Heaven on the Creation of the World  p  THE CURE OF SAUL A SACRED ODE  "VENGEANCE arise from thy infernal Bed  "And pour thy Tempest oh his Guilty Head"  Thus Heav'n's Decree in Thunder's Sound  Shook the dark Abyss profound  The unchain'd Furies come  Pale  Melancholy  stalks from Hell  Th' abortive Offspring of her Womb  Despair  and  Anguish  round her yell  By sleepless Terror SAUL possess'd  Deep feels the Fiend within his tortur'd Breast  Midnight Spectres round him howl  Before his Eyes  In Troops they rise  And Seas of Horror overwhelm his Soul  Haste to JESSE's  Son  repair  He best can sweep the Lyre  Wake the solemn sounding Air  And lead the vocal Choir  On ev'ry String softbreathing Raptures dwell  To sooth the Throbbings of the troubled Breast  Whose magic Voice can bid the Tides of Passion swell  Or lull the raging Storm to Rest  Sunk on his Couch and loathing Day  The heav'nforsaken  Monarch  lay  To the sad Couch the  Shepherd  now drew near  And while th' obedient  Choir  stood round  Prepar'd to catch the Soulcommanding Sounds  He drop'd a gen'rous Tear  Thy pitying Aid O GOD impart  For lo thy poison'd Arrows drink his Heart  The mighty Song from  Chaos  rose  Around his Throne the formless Atoms sleep  And drowzy Darkness broods upon the Deep  Confusion  wake  Bid the Realms of  Chaos  shake  Rouse him from his dread Repose  Hark loud  Discord  breaks her Chain  The hostile Atoms clash with deafning Roar  Her hoarse Voice thunders through the drear Domain  And kindles ev'ry Element to War  "Tumult cease  "Sink to Peace  "Let there be Light"Th'  Almighty  said  And lo the radiant  Sun  Flaming from his orient Bed  His endless Course begun  See the twinkling  Pleiads  rise  Thy Star  Orion  reddens in the Skies  While slow around the northern Plain  Arcturus  wheels his nightly Wane  Thy Glories too refulgent  Moon  he sung  Thy mystic Mazes and thy changeful Ray  O fairest of the starry Throng  Thy solemn Orb of Light  Guides the triumphant Carr of Night  O'er Silver Clouds and sheds a softer Day  Ye  Planets  and each circling  Constellation  In Songs harmonious tell your Generation  Oh while yon radiant  Seraph  turns the Spheres  And on the stedfast PoleStar stands sublime  Wheel your Rounds  To heav'nly Sounds  And sooth his Songinchanted Ears  With your celestial Chime  In dumb Surprize the list'ning Monarch lay  His Woe suspended by sweet Music's Sway  And awestruck with uplifted Eye  Mus'd on the newborn Wonders of the Sky  Lead the soothing Verse along  He feels he feels the Pow'r of Song  Ocean hastens to his Bed  The lab'ring Mountain rears his rockencumber'd Head  Down his steep and shaggy Side  The torrent rolls his thund'ring Tide  Then smooth and clear along the fertile Plain  Winds his majestic Waters to the distant Main  Flocks and Herds the Hills adorn  The Lark highfoaring hails the Morn  And while along yon crimsonclouded Steep  The slow Sun steals into the golden Deep  Hark the solemn Nightingale  Warbles to the woodland Dale  See descending Angels show'r  Heav'n's own Bliss on  Eden's  Bow'r  Peace on Nature's Lap reposec  Pleasure strews her guiltless Roses  Joys divine in Circles move  Link'd with Innocence and Love  Hail happy Love with Innocence combin'd  All hail ye sinless Parents of Mankind  They paus'dthe Monarch prostrate on his Bed  Submissive bow'd his Head  Ador'd the Works of boundless Pow'r divine  Then Anguishstruck he cry'd and smote his Breast  Why why is Peace the welcome Guest  Of ev'ry Heart but Mine  Now let the solemn lumbers flow  Till he feel that Guilt is Woe  Heav'nly Harp in mournful Strain  O'er yon weeping Bow'r complain  What Sounds of bitter Pangs I hear  What Lamentations wound mine Ear  In vain devoted Pair these Tears ye shed  Peace with Innocence is fled  The Messengers of Grace depart  Death glares and shakes the dreadful Dart  Ah whither fly ye by yourselves abhor'd  To shun that frowning Cherub's firey Sword  Lo  Hapless hapless Pair  Goaded by Despair  Forlorn thro' desert Climes they go  Wake my Lyre can Pity sleep  When Heav'n is mov'd and Angels weep  Flow ye melting Numbers flow  Till he feel that Guilt is Woe  The King with Pride and Shame and Anguish torn  Shot Fury from his Eyes and Scorns  The glowing Youth  Bold in Truth  So still should Virtue guilty Pow'r engage  With Brow undaunted met his Rage  See his Cheek kindles into generous Fire  Stern he bends him o'er his Lyre  And while the Doom of Guilt he sings  Shakes Horror from the tortur'd Strings  What Sounds of Terror and Distress  Rend yon howling Wilderness  The dreadful Thunders found  The forked Lightnings flash along the Ground  Why yawns that deep'ning Gulph below  'Tis for Heav'n's rebellious Foe  Fly ye Sons of ISRAEL fly  Who dwells in  Korah's  guilty Tents must die  They sinkHave Mercy LordTheir Cries  In dreadful Tumult rise  Hark from the Deep their loud Laments I hear  They lessen now and lessen on the Ear  Now Destruction's Strife is o'er  The countless Host  For ever lost  The Gulph is clos'dTheir Cries are heard no more  But Oh my Lyre what Accents can relate  Sinful Man's appointed Fate  He comes he comes th' avenging GOD  Clouds and Darkness round him rowl  Tremble Earth Ye Mountains nod  He bows the Skies and shakes the Pole  The gloomy Banners of his Wrath unfurl'd  He calls the Floods to drown a guilty World  "  Ruin  lift thy baleful Head  "Rouze the guilty World from Sleep  "Lead up thy Billows from their cavern'd Bed  "And burst the Rocks that chain thee in the Deep"  Now th'impetuous Torrents rise  The hoarseascending Deluge roars  Down rush the Cataracts from the Skies  The swelling Waves o'erwhelm the Shores  Just O God is thy Decree  Shall guilty Man contend with Thee  Lo  Hate  and  Envy  seaintomb'd  And  Rage  with  Lust  in Ruin sleep  And scoffing  Luxury  is doom'd  To glut the vast and rav'nous Deep  In vain from  Fate  th' astonish'd Remnant flies  "Shrink ye Rocks Ye Oceans rise"  The tottering Cliffs no more the Floods controul  Sea following Sea ingulphs the Ball  O'er the sunk Hills the watry Mountains rowl  And wide  Destruction  swallows all  Now fiercer let th' impassion'd Numbers glow  Swell the Song ye mighty Choir  Wing your dreadful Darts with Fire  Hear me MonarchGuilt is Woe  Thus while the frowning  Shepherd  pour'd along  The deep impetuous Torrent of his Song  SAUL stung by dire Despair  Gnash'd his Teeth and tore his Hair  From his Blood by Horror chill'd  A cold and agonizing Sweat distill'd  Then foaming with unutterable Smart  He aim'd a Dagger at his Heart  His watchful Train prevent the Blow  And call each lenient Balm to heal his frantic Woe  But pleas'd the  Shepherd  now beheld  His Pride by Heav'n's own Terrors quell'd  Then bade his potent Lyre controul  The mighty Storm that rent his Soul  Cease your Cares the Body's Pain  A sweet Relief may find  But Gums and lenient Balms are vain  To heal the wounded Mind  Come fair  Repentance  from the Skies  O sainted Maid with upcast Eyes  Descend in thy celestial Shrowd  Vested in a weeping Cloud  Holy Guide descend and bring  Mercy  from th' eternal King  Calm his Soul your Beams impart  And pour your Comforts o'er his Heart  They come O King thine Ear incline  Listen to their Voice divine  Their Voice shall every Pang compose  To gentle Sorrow melt thy Woes  Till each pure Wish to Heav'n shall soar  And Peace return to part no more  Behold obedient to their great Command  The lifted Dagger quits his trembling Hand  Smooth'd is his Brow where sullen Care  And furrow'd Horror couch'd with fell Despair  No more his Eyes with Fury glow  But heav'nly Grief succeeds to hellborn Woe  See the Signs of Grace appear  See the soft relenting Tear  Trickling at sweet Mercy's Call  Catch it Angels ere it fall  And let the heartsent Offering rise  Heav'n's bestaccepted Sacrifice  Yet yet againAh see the Pang returns  Again with inward Fire his heaving Bosom burns  Now  Shepherds  wake a mightier Strain  Search the deep heart rending Pain  Till the large Floods of Sorrow roll  And quench the Tortures of his Soul  Almighty LORD accept his Pang sincere  Let heav'nly Hope dispell each dark Temptation  And while he pours the penitential Tear  O visit him with thy Salvation  Stoop from Heav'n ye raptur'd Throng  Sink ye swelling Tides of Song  For lo dissolv'd by Music's melting Pow'r  Celestial Sorrow rolls her plenteous Show'r  O'er his wan Cheek the Colours rise  And Beams of Comfort brighten in his Eyes  Happy King thy Woes are o'er  Thy God shall wound thy Heart no more  The pitying Father of Mankind  Meets the purereturning Mind  No more shall black Despair afflict his Soul  Each gentler Sound ye Shepherds now combine  Sweetly let the Numbers roll  Sooth him into Hope divine  Now lowly let the rustic Measure glide  To quell the dark Remains of selfconsuming Pride  Till Nature's homesprung Blessings he confess  And own that calm Content is Happiness  Ye Woods and Lakes ye Cliffs and Mountains

Smiles array'd  To dwell beneath his PalmTree Shade  Hail meek Angel awful Guest  Still pour thy Radiance o'er my Breast  Pride  and  Hate  in Courts may shine  The  Shepherd's  calm and blameless

sublime MILTON who knew and felt their Force But Those whom  Nature  had thus  joined  toge∣ther  Man  by his false Refinements hath most  unnaturally  put  asunder  The Purpose of the following Dissertation therefore is to trace the  Rise Union  and  Progression  of  Poetry  and  Music  as they are found to exist in their several Kinds and Gradations among Mankind thence to consider the Causes which have produced that  Separation  under which they now lie and have often lain among the more polished Nations and in Conclusion to point out the  Circumstances  in which and the  Means  by which they may possibly be  again united  SECT II The proposed Method of Inquiry  WHATEVER is founded in such  Passions  and  Principles  of Action as are  common  to the whole  Race  of  Man  will be most effectually investigated as to its  Origin  and  Progress  by viewing Man in his  savage  or  uncultivated  State Here before Education and Art have cast their Veil over the human Mind its various Powers throw themselves out and all its Workings present them∣selves instantly and without Disguise  It may be affirmed with Truth that for Want of begin∣ning our Inquiries at this early and neglected Period and by viewing Man under his State of  Civilization  only many curious and interesting Questions have been left involved in Darkness which might have been clearly unfolded by a free and full Research into the Passions Propensities and Qualities of  savage  Man  This the Writer hopes to make appear in a more  exten∣sive Degree  and on Subjects of  higher Importance  through the Course of a future Work  The Work advertised at the End of this Dissertation  of which some of the Principles here delivered will make an incidental Part In the mean Time he intends to treat the present Subject in the Way now proposed by deducing his Argument from the first great and original Fountain of  savage Life  and  Manners  SECT III Of Music Dance and Poem in the savage State  BY examining savage Life where untaught Nature rules we find that the  agreeable Passions  of Love Pity Hope Joy and Exultation no less than their  Con∣traries  of Hate Revenge Fear Sorrow and Despair op∣pressing the human Heart by their mighty Force are thrown out by the three Powers of  Action Voice  and  articulate Sounds  The  Brute  Creatures express their Passions by the two first of These some by  Action  some by  Voice  and some by  both  united Beyond these  Man  has the added Power of  articulate Speech  The same Force of  Association  and  Fancy  which gives him  higher Degrees  and a  wider Variety  of  Passion  gives rise to this  additional Power  of expressing those Passions which he feels  Among the  Savages  who are in the  lowest Scale  of the human Kind these several Modes of expressing their Passions are found altogether suited to their wretched State Their  Gestures  are  uncouth  and  horrid  Their  Voice  is thrown out in  Howls  and  Roarings  Their  Language  is like the  Gabbling of Geese  But if we ascend a Step or two higher in the Scale of savage Life we shall find this  Chaos  of  Gesture Voice  and  Speech  rising into an agreeable  Order  and  Proportion  The natural Love of a  measured Melody  which Time and Ex∣perience produce throws the  Voice  into  Song  the  Gesture  into  Dance  the  Speech  into  Verse  or  Numbers  The Ad∣dition of musical  Instruments  comes of Course They are  but  Imitations  of the human Voice or of other natural Sounds produced gradually by frequent Trial and Ex∣periment  Such is the Generation and natural Alliance of these three  SisterGraces Music Dance  and  Poem  which we find moving Hand in Hand among the savage Tribes of every Climate  For the Truth of the Fact we may appeal to most of the Travellers who describe the Scenes of uncultivated Nature All these agree in telling us that  Melody Dance  and  Song  make up the ruling Pastime adorn the Feasts com∣pose the Religion fix the Manners strengthen the Policy and even form the future Paradise of savage Man That having few Wants and consequently much Leisure the barbarous Tribes addict themselves to these assuring Arts with a wonderful Degree of Passion unless where their Manners are corrupted by an incidental Commerce with the Offscum of civilized Nations By these attractive and powerful Arts they celebrate their public Solemnities by these they lament their private and public Calamities the Death of Friends or the Loss of Warriors By these united they express their Joy on their Marriages Har∣vests Huntings Victories praise the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes excite each other to War and brave Exploits or to suffer Death and Torments with un∣shaken Constancy  These are the Circumstances most  common  to the savage Tribes Besides these there are many  peculiar  Modes which arise from their different Climates Situations Opi∣nions Manners Among some Tribes the  joyous  Passions  among some the  gentle  among others the  ferocious  pre∣dominate and take Place To give all the Varieties of these savage and festal Solemnities were an endless Labour Let the following Account suffice as a general Image of the rest which is singled out not only because it is the most circumstantial but likewise for the particular Relation which it will be found to bear to a following Part of this Inquiry  The IROQUOIS HURONS and some less considerable Tribes are free and independent Savages who inhabit the northern Continent of AMERICA and extend their Set∣tlements from the Back of the  British Colonies  to the Bor∣ders of the  Great Lakes  along the Skirts of LOUISIANA and down the River OHIO towards the MISSISIPI and the Gulph of FLORIDA Father LAFITAU  Moeurs des Sauvages  tom ii p c  mo    gives the following Description of their festal Solemnities which it is necessary to transcribe at large in order to give an adequate Idea of their Manners and Character  "On the appointed Day early in the Morning they prepare the Feast in the  CouncilCabbin  and there they dispose all Things for the AssemblyIn the mean∣time a public Crier goes through the Village and gives Notice that the  Kettle  is hung on in such a Cabbin The common People and even the Chiefs bring with them their  little Kettle  It doth not appear that there is any Distinction of Ranks among them except that the  old Men  occupy the foremost Matts The IRO∣QUOISE  Women  assist not that I know of at these Kind of Feasts nor are they invited The  Children  and  young Men  who are not as yet chosen into the Body of Warriors mount upon the Scaffolds which are placed over the Matts and even upon the Roof of the Cabbin itself and look down through the Hole at which the Smoke goes out"  "While the Assembly is forming He who makes the Feast or He in whose Name it is made  sings alone  The Design of this is to entertain the Company on such Things as have Relation to the Subject on which they assemble These  Songs  for the most Part are fill∣ed with the  Fables  of  ancient Times  the  heroic Deeds  of their  Nation  and are composed in an  antiquated Style  so old that often they understand not what they say The Singer hath sometimes an Assistant who relieves him when he is fatigued For they sing with all their Force"  "The Speaker then opens the Scene by asking in Form if all who are invited are come He then names the Person who makes the Feast he declares the Occasion on which it is made and enters into a particular Detail of all that is in the Kettle At every thing which he names the whole Choir replies by a repeated Shout of Approbation"  "The Speaker then gives an Account of every thing which it is of Importance that the Public should know For these  SongFeasts  being made on all  weighty Occa∣sions  which regard the  Village  or the  Nation  this is the proper Time for public Affairs as that of renewing a  Name  hearing  Ambassadors  or  proclaiming War  by  Song  "  "When the Orator hath done speaking sometimes they begin to eat before they sing that they may have the better Spirits Sometimes they sing before they eat If the Feast is to continue for the whole Day the Kettle is in Part empty'd in the Morning and in Part reserved for the Evening and in the Intervals they  sing  and  dance  "  "The Master of the Feast touches nothing He busies himself only in seeing that the Company be served or in serving them himself naming aloud the Pieces which he destines and presents to each The best Morsels are given by Way of Preference to those whom he chuseth to distinguish"  "After the Repast the Master of the Feast begins the  Athonront  a  Song and Dance  peculiar to the  Men  They relieve each other by beginning with those of  most Consideration  and passing gradually down to the  Young∣est  They have that Civility and Attention to each other that every one waits till another of superior Dig∣nity enters the Lists and takes the Lead"  "The  Ancients  and Men of Dignity often do no more than  rise  from their Seats and content themselves while they  sing  with making some  Inflexions  with their Head Shoulders and Knees in order to  accompany  and  sustain  their  Song  Others somewhat less grave take a few Steps and walk along the Cabin around the Fires Every one hath his particular  Song  that is an  Air  to which he  adjusts  a very few  Words  which he repeats as often as he pleaseth I have observed that they even  retrench  or  strike off  some  Syllables  from their Words as if they were  Verses  or  measured  Words but  without Rhyme  "  "He who means to dance begins by rising from his Matt and the whole Company answers him by a gene∣ral Shout of Approbation As he passeth along before every Fire they who sit on each Side  beat  the  Measure  or  Cadence  of his  Song  by a correspondent Motion of the Head and by throwing out continual Shouts which they redouble at certain Times where the Measure de∣mands it with so much Truth that they never err and with such a Delicacy of Ear as the  French  who are most practised in their Customs cannot attain to When he passeth to a second Fire They of the first take Breath They of the more distant Fires are likewise silent But the  Time  is always  beat  by those before whose Fire he sings and dances The Song concludes by a general  Ehoue  of the whole Choir which is a second Shout of Approbation"  "The  young  Men have their  Songs  of a more  lively  and their  Dances  of a more  vigorous  Cast such as are suit∣able to their Age When the Dance is much animated they dance two or three together each at his own Fire Nor does this Mixture ever occasion any Confusion"  "Among these Dances  some  are no more than a  simple  and  noble  Manner of  marching  up to an  Enemy  and of  facing Danger  with  Intrepidity  and  Gaiety  of Mind"  "A second Sort of Dance but still of the same Kind is that of the  Pantomimes  Which consists in representing an Action in the Manner in which it passed or such as they conceive it to have been Many of those who have  lived among the IROQUOIS have assured me that after a Chief of War hath circumstantially recounted at his Return all that had passed in the Expeditions he had undertaken and the Battles he had fought they who are present at the Recital often rise on the sudden to dance and represent those Actions with great Vivacity as if they had been present And all this without any pre∣vious Concert or Preparation"  "In their  Songs  they  praise  not only their  Gods  and  Heroes  but they likewise praise  themselves  In this they are not sparing and are even  prodigal  in their  Praise  of  others  whom they think  worthy  of it He who is thus applauded answers by a shout of Thanks as soon as he hears himself named"  "They are still quicker at  rallying  each other and suc∣ceed to a Wonder in This He who dances takes whomsoever he pleaseth by the Hand and brings him forth into the midst of the Assembly to which he yields without Resistance Meanwhile the  Dancer  con∣tinues to  sing  and sometimes in his  Song  and some∣times in the  Intervals  he throws his  Sarcasms  on the Patient who hears him without ReplyAt every  Bon Mot  loud  Peals  of  Laughter  arise along the  Galleries  who  animate  this  Sport  and often oblige the Patient to cover his Head in his Mantle"  "They have another Kind of  Dance  in which the whole  Choir  dances and this is common both to Men and Wo∣men As this is very different from the preceeding ones they do not use it in their  SongFeasts  Their Pretenders  to Magic  Charlatans  a Word with which we have none precisely correspon∣dent in our Language It signifies here one who is a Pretender to  Mede∣cine  by the Arts of  Magic  often ordain it as an  Act  of  Religion  for the  healing  of the  Sick  it is also one of their Modes of  Di∣vination  It is likewise practised at Times as a mere Exercise of  Pleasure  at the Feasts and Solemnities of the Village The Manner is as follows Notice is given early in the Morning through all the Cabins for the Performance of this Ceremony Every Cabin de∣putes a certain Number either of Men or Women who dress themselves in all their Finery that they may go and perform their Part They all appear at the ap∣pointed Hour which is proclaimed by a public Crier either in the CouncilCabin or some other Place destined for the Purpose In the middle of the Place or Cabin they build a little Scaffold and on this they raise a small Seat for the  Singers  who are to  accompany  and  animate  the  Dance  One holds in his Hand a  Tambour  or little  Drum  the other a  Tortoise Shell  While these sing and accompany their Song with the Sound of their Instru∣ments which is farther Strengthened by the Spectators who beat with little Sticks upon the  Kettles  that are before them they who dance go round in a circular Movement but without taking Hands as they do in Europe Each Dancer makes various Motions with his Feet and Hands as he pleaseth And though all the Movements are different according to the Whim and Caprice of their Imagination none of them ever lose the  Time  They who are most expert in varying their  Postures and throwing themselves into Action are reckoned to excel the rest The Dance is composed of several  Returns  Each  Return  lasts till the Dancers are out of Breath and after a short Interval of  Repose  they begin  another  Nothing can be more animated than these Movements To see them one would say they were a Troop of furious and frantic People What must fatigue them still more is that not only by their Move∣ment but likewise with their Voice they follow the Sing∣ers and their Instruments to the End of each  Return  which is always closed by a general and loud  Oueh  which is a Shout of Approbation implying that the  Re∣turn  hath been well performed"  "Athough I have not spoken particularly of any Na∣tions but those of the IROQUOIS and HURONS yet I may truly say that I have described at the same Time  all  the other barbarous Nations of AMERICA as to what is  essential  and  principal  For though there ap∣pears to be a great Difference between the  Monarchic  and  Oligarchic  State yet the Genius of their savage Po∣licy is every where the same We find the same Turn for public Affairs the same Method of conducting them the same Use of secret and solemn Assemblies the same Character in their  Feasts  their  Dances  and their  Di∣versions  "  "The  Music  and  Dance  of the  Americans  have some∣thing in them extremely barbarous which at first dis∣gusts and of which no Idea can be formed by those who have not seen and heard them We grow recon∣ciled to them by Degrees and in the End partake of them with Pleasure As to the Savages themselves they  are fond of these Feasts even to Distraction They con∣tinue them whole Days and Nights entire and the Shouts of their  Choir  are so violent as to make the Vil∣lage tremble"  Thus far the learned Father LAFITAU For whose Detail no Apology needs be made to the curious Reader But the more particular Reasons why it is here given at Length will appear in the following Sections  SECT IV Of the natural Consequences of a supposed Civilization  WHILE these free and warlike Savages continue in their present  unlettered  State of Ignorance and Simplicity no material Improvements in their  SongFeasts  can arise But let us suppose that the Use of  Letters  should come among them and as a Cause or Consequence of  Civilization  be cultivated with that Spirit which is natural to a free and active People and many notable Consequences would appear Let us consider the most probable and striking among these natural Effects  Their Idea of  Music  in its most  inlarged  Sense would comprehend the three Circumstances of  Melody Dance  and  Song  For these three as we have seen being na∣turally conjoined because naturally producing each other would not  separately  command the Attention of such a People at their public Festivals Therefore  Instrumental Melody  without  Song  would be little attended to and of  no Esteem  because it would want all those Attractions which must arise from the correspondent  Dance  and  Song  In the early Periods of such a Commonwealth the  Chiefs  or  Legislators  would often be the  principal Musicians  The two Characters would commonly coalesce for we find that among the savage Tribes the  Chiefs  are they who most signalize themselves by  Dance  and  Song  and that their  Songs  rowl principally on the  great Actions  and  Events  which concern their  own Nation  Hence their most ancient  Gods  would naturally be styled  Singers  and  Dancers  For the most ancient  Gods  of civilized Pagan Countries are generally their early  Legislators  who taught their People the first Arts of Life These deceased Legislators therefore when advanced to the Rank of Gods would naturally be delivered down to Posterity with the same Attributes and Qualities by which they had distinguished themselves in Life And it ap∣pears from the last Article that these Qualities would naturally be those of  Dance  and  Song  Measured Periods or in other Words  Rythm Num∣bers  and  Verse  would naturally arise For measured Cadence or  Time  is an essential Part of Melody into which the human Ear naturally falls And as the same Force of Ear would lead the Action or Dance to cor∣respond with the Melody so the Words or Song must on a like Principle keep Pace with  Both  Among the  sa∣vage Americans  we see the first Rudiments of poetic Numbers emerging from this Source For  "as the Means of adjusting the Words to the Air or Melody they sometimes strike off Syllables from their Words"  And such is the natural Generation of  Rythm  and  Verse  Their earliest  Histories  would be written in  Verse  For we see that among the savage Tribes the Actions of  their Heroes and Gods and the great Events of their Nation make a principal Part of their Songs When∣ever therefore the Use of Letters should come among such a People these  ancient Songs  would naturally be  first recorded  for the Information and Use of future Times  Their most ancient  Maxims Exhortations Proverbs  or  Laws  would probably be written in Verse For these would naturally make a Part of their  Songs  of Celebration and would by Degrees be  selected  from thence would in Time become the  Standard  of  Right  and  Wrong  and as such be treasured up and appealed to by the improving Tribe  Their  religious Rites  would naturally be performed or accompany'd by  Dance  and  Song  For it appears from Fact that the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes are the most general Subject of the savage Dance and Song and the common End of Pagan Rites hath ever been to praise the Gods of the Country and by these Means as well as by Sacrifice to appease their Wrath or secure their Favour  Their  earliest Oracles  would probably be delivered in  Verse  and  sung  by the Priest or Priestess of the supposed God For these  Oracles  being supposed to be  inspired  by a deceased  Chief  now a  Deity  who had himself delivered his Exhortations in this  enthusiastic Manner  and being ad∣dressed to a Tribe among whom this Mode of Instruction universally prevailed no other Vehicle but that of  Verse  and  Song  could at first gain these  Oracles  either  Credit  or  Reception  Their  Melody  would be  simple  and derive a consider∣able Part of its Power from its  Rythm  or  Measure  without  any Mixture of  artificial Composition  First because this Kind would be most suited to the  Powers  of the barbarous  Legislators  or  Bards  at once  Composers  and  Performers  among whom nothing artificial or refined could as yet take Place Secondly because this  Simplicity  of Manner would be best adapted to the Capacity of the surrounding People incapable in this early Period to be attracted or moved by any thing but what  Nature  dictates  The Force of this simple Melody would be much increased by the Power of early  Association  and continued  Habit  For this by  appropriating  certain  Sounds  to certain  Subjects  would raise their Melody into a Kind of natural and expressive Language of the Passions  Their  Songs  would be of a  legislative  Cast and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or History of their own Country would contain the essential Parts of their  religious moral  and  political  Systems For we have seen above that the  Celebration  of their deceased Heroes would of Course grow into a  religious  Act That the  Exhortations  and  Maxims  intermixed with these Celebrations and found∣ed on the  Example  of their  HeroeGods  would naturally become the  Standard  of  Right  and  Wrong  that is the Foundation of  private Morals  and  public Law  And thus the whole Fabric of their  Religion Morals  and  Polity  would naturally arise from and be included in their  Songs  during their Progress from savage to civilized Life  MUSIC in the extended Sense of the Word that is including Melody Dance and Song would make an es∣sential and principal Part in the  Education  of their Chil∣dren For the important Principles of their  Religion Morals  and  Polity  being delivered and inculcated in their  Songs  no other Method could be devised which would so strongly impress the youthful Mind with the  approved Principles  of  Life  and  Action  MUSIC therefore in this extended Sense must gain a great and  universal Power  over the minds and Actions of such a People For through the Force of early and conti∣nued  Habit  together with the irresistible Contagion of general  Example  while every thing pleasing great and im∣portant was conveyed through this Medium and through this only such strong Impressions would strike themselves into the growing Mind as would give it its ruling Colour through Life and such as no future Incidents could easily weaken or efface  In the Course of Time and the Progress of Polity and Arts a  Separation  of the several Parts or Branches of Music in its extended Sense would naturally arise Till a certain Period of Civilization Letters and Art the seve∣ral Kinds would of course lie confused in a Sort of un∣distinguished Mass and be mingled in the same Composi∣tion as Inclination Enthusiasm or other Incidents might impel But repeated Trial and Experiment would natu∣rally produce a more artificial Manner and thus by De∣grees the several Kinds of Poem would assume their legi∣timate Forms  If their warlike Character continued the  Dance  would naturally  separate  from the  Song  and would itself become a  distinct Exercise  or  Art  for the sake of increasing their Strength and Agility of Body as the Means of ren∣dering them invincible in War For the Dance or Action of their SongFeasts being only secondary and merely an Appendage to the Song would not be of a Character suffi∣ciently  severe for the fierce and stubborn Contention of those who were destined to the immediate Toils of warlike Service  After a certain Period of Civilization the complex Character of  Legislator  and  Bard  would  separate  or be seldom united For as the Society grew more populous and the increasing Arts of Life increased the Labours and Cares of Government the  musical Art  in its extended Sense would of course be delegated by the civil Magi∣strate to such Men of Genius and Worth as might apply it to its proper Ends the Instruction and Welfare of Man∣kind    Hymns  or  Odes  would be composed and  Sung  by their Composers at their festal Solemnities For these in their simple State are but a Kind of rapturous Exclama∣tions of Joy Grief Triumph or Exultation in Conse∣quence of some great or disastrous Action known alluded to or expressed A Species of Composition which naturally ariseth from the savage SongFeast  The  Epic Poem  would naturally arise and be sung by its Composers at their public Solemnities For it ap∣pears above  Article  that their earliest Histories would be writ∣ten in Verse and make a Part of their public SongFeasts Now the  Epic Poem  is but a Kind of  fabulous History  rowling chiefly on the great Actions of ancient Gods and Heroes and artificially composed under certain Limi∣tations with Respect to its  Manner  for the Ends of Plea∣sure Admiration and Instruction  From an  Union  of these two a certain rude Outline of  Tragedy  would naturally arise We may see the first Seeds or Principles of this Poem in the Conduct of the savage  SongFeast  A  Chief sings  some great Action of a  God or Heroe The surrounding  Choir answer  him at In∣tervals by Shouts of Sympathy or concurrent Appro∣bation  In Process of Time this barbarous Scene would improve into a more perfect Form Instead of  relating  they would probably represent by Action and Song united those great or terrible Atchievements which their Heroes had performed For of this too we finds the Seeds or Principles in the savage State  "After a Chief of War hath recounted the Battles he had fought they who are present will often rise up to dance and represent those Actions with great Vivacity"  If to this we add the usual Exclamations of the surrounding Choir we here behold the first  rude Form of savage Tragedy  If the  Choir  should be  established  by general Use and should animate the Solemnity by  Dance  as well as  Song  the  Melody Dance  and  Song  would of course  regulate  each other and the  Ode  or  Song  would fall into  Stanzas  of some  particular Kind  This appears from the third Article  Another Consequence of an  established Choir  would be an unvaried Adherence to the  Unities  of  Place  and  Time  For a numerous Choir maintaining their Station through the whole Performance must give so forcible a Con∣viction to the Senses of the  Sameness  of  Place  and  Short∣ness  of  Time  that any Deviation from this apparent Unity must shock the Imagination with an Improbability too gross to be endured  Not only the Part of the tragic  Choir  but the  Episode  or  interlocutory  Part would be also  sung  For as the  Ode  and  Epic  would be  sung  from the earliest Periods so when they became  united  and by that Union formed the  tragic Species they of Course maintained the same Ap∣pendage of  Melody  which Nature and Custom had already given them  While the Nation held its  fierce  and  warlike  Cha∣racter the  tragic  Representations would chiefly turn on Subjects  distressful  or  terrible  For thus they would ani∣mate each other to  Victory  and  Revenge  by a Representa∣tion of what their  Friends  had  done  and  suffered  These Subjects would likewise be most accommodated to the natural Taste of the poetic Chiefs of such a People whose Atchievements must produce and abound with Events of Distress and Terror They also would be best suited to the Genius and Ends of their State and Polity For as the leading View of such a fierce and warlike People must be to destroy Pity and Fear so this would most effectually be done by making themselves familiar with distressful and terrible Representations The gentle Passions and less affecting Actions which might fill the Spectacles of a mild and peaceful Nation would be insipid to the Taste and incompatible with the Character of such a warlike People  As their Tragedy would be intended as a  visible Representation  of their ancient Gods and Heroes so it would be natural for them to invent some Means of  strengthening  the  Voice  and  aggrandising  the  Visage  and  Person  as the means of compleating the Resemblance For in all Savage Countries the  tallest  and  strongest  Men are generally selected as their  Chiefs  As their Tragic  Poets  would be  Singers  so they would be  Actors  and perform some capital Part in their own Pieces for the Stage For we see these different Cha∣racters are naturally united in the savage State There∣fore  till some extraordinary Change in Manners and Prin∣ciples should ensue this  Union  would of Course continue    Musical Contests  would be admitted as  public Exer∣cises  in such a State For we have seen that the impor∣tant Articles of Religion Morals and Polity would natu∣rally make a Part of their public Songs therefore public Contests of this Kind would be regarded as the best and surest Means of raising an Emulation of a most useful Na∣ture and of strengthening the State by inforcing all the fundamental Principles of Society in the most striking and effectual Manner  The Profession of  Bard  or  Musician  would be held as very honourable and of high Esteem For he would be vested with a Kind of  public Character  and if not an original Legislator yet still he would be regarded as a  subordinate  and  useful Servant  of the  State    Odes  or  Hymns  would naturally make a Part of their  domestic Entertainments  and the  Chiefs  would be proud to signalize themselves by their Skill in  Melody  and  Song  For their Songs being enriched with all the great and im∣portant Subjects relative to the public State nothing could be more suitable to a high Station in the Commonwealth than a Proficiency in this sublime and legislative Art  When  Music  had attained to this State of relative Perfection it would be regarded as a  necessary Accom∣plishment  And if any Man or Society of Men were unacquainted with the Practice and Power of Music their Ignorance in this Art would be regarded as a capital De∣fect For it would imply a Deficiency in the three great leading Articles of Education  Religion Morals  and  Po∣lity  The Genius of their  Music  would  vary  along with their  Manners  For Manners being the leading and most essential Quality of Man All his other Tastes and Ac∣quirements naturally correspond with  These  and accom∣modate themselves to his Manners as to their chief and original Cause  As a Change of Manners must influence their Mu∣sic so by a reciprocal Action a Change in their Music must influence Manners For we have seen that Music was the  established Vehicle  of all the great Principles of Education Therefore a Change in Music must tend to bring on a Change in  These  A Provident Community of Principles uncommonly severe would probably fix both the Subjects and Move∣ments of Song and Dance by Law This would arise from their Knowledge of the mutual Influence of Man∣ners and Music on each other  In a Society of more libertine and relaxed Princi∣ples the Corruption of Music would naturally arise along with the Corruption of Manners for the Reasons now assigned and the Musicians Bards or Poets would be the immediate Instruments of this Corruption For being educated in a corrupt State they would be apt to debase their Art to vile and immoral Purposes as the means of gaining that Applause which would be the natural Ob∣ject of their Ambition  In Consequence of this Corruption a gradual and total  Separation  of the  Bard's  or  Musician's  complex Cha∣racter would ensue For the  Chief  would now no longer pride himself on the Character of  Poet  or Performer nor the  Man  of  Genius  and  Worth  descend to the Profession  of  Lyrist Singer  or  Actor  Because these Professions which had formerly been the Means of inculcating every thing laudable and great would now when perverted to the contrary Purposes be disdained by the Wise and Vir∣tuous  Hence the Power the Utility and Dignity of  Music  would sink into a general Corruption and Contempt This Consequence is so plain as to need no Illustration  SECT V An Application of these Principles to the Melody Dance and Song of ancient  Greece  SUCH may seem to be the Consequences which would naturally arise in a savage free and warlike State should  Letters  be introduced and cultivated among such a spirited and active People In Support of the Truth of these Deductions let us now endeavour to  realize  them by shewing that such Consequences did in Fact arise in ancient GREECE In the Course of this Review which will con∣tain the Rise Progress Power Perfection Separation and Corruption of their  Melody Dance  and  Song  we may per∣haps be fortunate enough on the Principles here given to fix some Things which have been held doubtful to unfold others which have hitherto been confessedly unaccountable and to resolve others into their proper and evident Causes which have been attributed to such Causes as never had Existence  "Their Idea of  Music  in its most inlarged Sense comprehended the three Circumstances of  Melody Dance  and  Song  "This appears from the concurrent Testi∣mony  of many ancient Authors The following one from the  Alcibiades  of PLATO may alone be a sufficient Autho∣rity  "  Socr  Tell me first what Art is that to which it belongs properly to  sing  to  play  and  dance  Cannot you find a Name for this comprehensive Art  Alcib  I cannot  Socr  Try a little Who are the Goddesses that preside over this Art  Alcib  Do you mean the MUSES  Socr  I do Consider then what Name the Art receives from them  Alcib  You seem to hint at MUSIC  Socr  You are right  PLATO ALCIBIADES  "  The same Truth is no less evident from the circumstantial Account which ATHENAEUS gives of the old ARCADIAN  Music  which in its general Acceptation included  Melody Dance  and  Song  Deipnosoph  l xiv  It appears then that this Combination or Union of these three  SisterGraces  arose naturally in ancient GREECE from an Improvement of the  savage  State into a certain Degree of  Civilization  They needed no  Art  to joyn them For as they  naturally  produce each other and are naturally conjoyned in the savage and uncultivated State this Union would of Course continue till some vio∣lent Change in Manners or Principles should break that Union which Nature had establishedIt appears no less evidently from ancient Writers that what we call  Instru∣mental Music  that is the Melody of Instruments unac∣company'd by Dance or Song was a Thing never held in Esteem till the later Periods of Antiquity in which a general Separation took Place This will appear more at large hereafter PLATO calls Instrumental Music  "an  un∣meaning Thing  and an  Abuse of Melody  De Legi∣bus  l i  "  "In the earliest Periods of the  Greek  States their Legislators were often Bards or their Bards were Legis∣lators" Such in a more eminent Degree were A∣POLLO ORPHEUS AMPHION LINUS and MUSAEUS  PLATO  de Rep  l ii  Of this Rank too was THALES the  Cretan  Lawgiver who composed Laws in Verse and sung them to his Lyre  STRABO  Geog  l x  It hath been generally supposed that the story'd Power of their Lyres and Songs meant no more than by a metaphorical Expression to convey a strong Idea of their Eloquence and legislative Art in producing  Order  from  Confusion  Thus PLUTARCH tells us that  "the An∣cients represented the Statues of the Gods with Musical Instruments in their Hands not as being really Lyres or Flutes but because they thought that nothing so much suited the Character and Office of the Gods as  Harmony  and  Order  PLUT  de Procreat Animae  c  "  Thus too a noble Writer of our own Country declares his Opinion and says that  "  Tra∣dition  which soon grew  fabulous  could not better repre∣sent the first  Founders  or Establishers of large Societies than as  real Songsters  Characteristics  vol i p  "  But  real Songsters  be∣yond Doubt they were nor was Tradition  fabulous  in thus representing them For from a View of human Na∣ture as emerging from the savage State it is evident that the  Song  and  Lyre  as soon as the Lyre was invented must be the natural Means or Instruments of Civilization by conveying the Legislator's Precepts to the surrounding People For we have seen that among the savage Tribes the  Chiefs  are proud to signalize themselves by  Song  that they  preside  at the  Song Feasts  and that their Songs rowl  principally on the great Actions Affairs and Events of their own NationA concurrent Proof of this natural Union of the Bard's and Legislator's Office might be drawn were it necessary from the Name which the old THESSALIANS gave their  Magistrates  They styled them  or  "the Leaders of the Dance and SongFeast  LUCIAN  de Saltatione  "  A Circumstance which plainly points out its own Origin  "Their most ancient Gods were stiled  Singers  and Dancers" Thus HORACE calls APOLLO the  Singer  Ep ad Pisones  PINDAR stiles him the  Dancer  Ode  HOMER of the Au∣thor of the Hymns that pass under his Name gives him the same Appellation  Hymn in Apollinem  RHEA the Mother of JUPITER is said to have taught her Priests the Art of  Dancing  both in PHRYGIA and CRETE  LUCIAN  de Saltatione  As CASTOR and POLLUX instructed the  Lacedemonians  in the same Art  Ibid  EUMELUS or ARCTINUS the  Corinthian  brings in even JUPITER himself  dancing  in these Words  Among them danc'd the Sire of Gods and Men  Apud  ATHENAEUM  Deipn  l i    Whence it arose that these ancient Gods were repre∣sented as  Singers  and  Dancers  and vested with a Quality which at first Sight seems altogether foreign to their Cha∣racter hath not as yet been accounted for We now see the true and natural Origin of these Appellations For the most ancient Gods among the civilized  Greeks  were their early Legislators who taught the savage Tribes the first Arts of Life These deceased Legislators therefore when ad∣vanced to the Rank of Gods were naturally delivered down  to Posterity with the same Attributes or Qualities by which they distinguished themselves in Life and it ap∣pears from a View of the  Chiefs  of the savage Tribes that these Qualities would naturally be those of  Dance  and  Song  "Measured Periods or in other Words Rythm Numbers and Verse did naturally arise" The general Reason is assigned in the fourth Article of the last Section and needs not to be repeated here But as some particular Consequences arise from this Foundation relative to the most ancient  History Laws  and  Oracles  these will deserve a separate Consideration  "Their earliest Histories were written in Verse" This Fact is indisputable but seems not as yet to have been resolved into its true Cause STRABO informs us that "The Poetic Form first appeared They who imi∣tated it dropped the Measure Such were CADMUS the  Milesian  PHERECYDES and HECATAEUS  STRABO l i  These were the first  Greek  Historians who writ in  Prose  Another learned Ancient confirms this Account and says  "In these early Times so general was the Inclination to Rythm and Numbers that all Instruction was given in Verse There was neither  History  nor  Philosophy  nor any Action to be described but what was dressed by the  Muses  PLUTARCH  "  Not only the  Greek  Writers give a con∣current Testimony concerning the Priority of  historical Verse  to  Prose  but the Records of all Nations unite in con∣firming it The oldest Compositions among the ARABS are in Rythm or rude Verse and are often cited as Proofs  of the Truth of their subsequent History  Hist de las Guerras Civil de Grenada  The Ac∣counts we have of the  Peruvian  Story confirm the same Fact For GARCILASSO tells us that he compiled a Part of his  Commentaries  from the  ancient Songs  of the Coun∣try  Comment Real  Nay all the  American  Tribes who have any Com∣positions are found to establish the same Truth  LAFITAU  Nor∣thern EUROPE contributes its Share of Testimony For there too we find the  Scythian  or  Runic  Songs many of them  historical  to be the oldest Compositions among these barbarous Nations  BARTHOLIN  de Contemptu Motis  c HICKES  Thes Septentr  ODIN is said to have boasted that  "his Runic Poems were given him by the Gods  SHERINGHAM  Orig Gent Angl  "  A Circumstance which proves them to have been of the high∣est Antiquity  The Fact then is clear and certain And as it is some∣what mysterious to common Apprehension various Solu∣tions have been attempted by the Learned though in my Opinion without Success I shall give them as they ap∣pear in various Writers  LONGINUS hath aimed at something like a Reason in the following Passage  "Measure belongs  naturally  to Poetry as its Province is the Description and  Language  of the  Passions  together with  Fiction  or Fable which  produce Numbers  Hence it was that the Ancients even in their common Discourse used Measure and Verse rather than Prose  LONGIN  de Metr  "  It can hardly be necessary to observe that the celebrated Critic in this Passage gives a mere  Affirmation  instead of an  Argument  He says indeed  "that the Language of the Passions and Fiction natu∣rally produce Measure and Numbers"  But the Reason is still to seek It were to be wished that in many Parts of his Writings he had not given us more Instances of his fine Taste than his Power of Reasoning  A learned Modern of our own Nation hath try'd his Talent in this curious Question  "They the Ancients thought it would seem that Language was the first Tamer of Men and took its Origin to have been cer∣tain rude accidental Sounds which that naked Company of scrambling Mortals emitted by Chance Upon this Supposition it will follow that at first they uttered these Sounds in a  much higher Note  than we do our Words now occasioned  perhaps  by their falling on them under some Passion Fear Wonder or Pain and then using the same Sound either when the Object or Accident re∣curred or when they wanted to describe it by what they felt from its Presence  Neither  the  Syllables  nor the  Tone  could be  ascertained  but when prompted by the Return of the Passion under which they invented them they  extended  their  Throats  and put several of these Marks together they would  seem  to  sing  Hence  signified at first simply to  speak  or utter the Voice which now with a small Abbreviation  signifies to  sing  And hence came the ancient Opinion which ap∣pears so  strange  to  Us  that Poetry was before Prose  Enq into the Life  of HOMER p  "  Here we see an ingenious Writer toiling in vain to prop a mistaken Principle For to omit all the weak Parts of the Paragraph which might expose it to Ridicule if nei∣ther  Syllables  nor  Tones  could be  ascertained  it follows that neither  Measure  nor  Melody  could arise and therefore it must even continue to appear as strange as ever  "that Poetry should be before Prose"  Mr DE VOLTAIRE talks more speciously after ARIS∣TOTLE and PLUTARCH  See the following Articles  on this Subject  "Before HERODOTUS even History was not written but in Verse among the GREEKS who had borrowed this Custom from the ancient EGYPTIANS the wisest the best po∣liced and the most knowing People upon Earth This Custom was very  reasonable  for the End of History was to preserve to Posterity the  Memory  of those few great Men whose Example might be of Service to Mankind They only writ what was worthy of being retained by Heart This is the Reason why they laid hold of the Harmony of  Verse  that they might aid the  Memory  And hence it was that the first  Philosophers Legislators  and  Historians  were all  Poets  Preface à Oedip  "  As this is the most plausible Reason that hath as yet been assigned for this mysterious Fact it will deserve a particular Consideration The Cause assigned seems there∣fore to rest on no probable Foundation for the following Reasons  First because it seems to take for granted the Existence of the very Thing which it is said to have produced If we suppose Rythm Numbers and Verse to exist and be in general Use they would undoubtedly become the natu∣ral Means of Memory and Record among a barbarous Peo∣ple But to  invent  the Vehicle of  Rythm  from a  Foresight  of its being the best Instrument of Memory without any prior Impulse from unassisted Nature seems altogether in∣compatible with the general Character of the savage Tribes For in the Period of savage Manners the Power of  ab∣stract Reasoning  is always  weak  and is often found to have  no Place  Again The  Universality  of the Fact adds greatly to the Improbability of the Cause assigned Though we should suppose it possible or probable that one savage Chief might by Dint of Reason strike out this new method of recording History yet that  All  savage Chiefs in every known Age and Climate should  unite  in the  same  Contrivance is highly improbable If one of more exalted Capacity de∣livered his Stories in Verse  another  of inferior Reach and Invention would naturally give them to Posterity in plain Prose Nay the acknowledged Difficulty of  Versification  would naturally make the  prosaic  Manner the more  com∣mon  though less effectual Method of the two Now the contrary to this is acknowledged to be true even by those who contend for the Truth and Sufficiency of the Cause assigned The  Universality  of the Fact is allowed by All Such an universal Coincidence therefore must spring from some other Cause such as ariseth unalterably from Na∣ture and takes Place among the savage Tribes in an universal and unvaried Manner  Farther If the ancient Songs prior to prose in every Nation had been  coolly composed  for the Sake of  Tradition  and  Information only  they would have been  circumstantial  and  precise  Whereas the contrary appears in their Con∣struction They are generally  vague  and  enthusiastic  and  bear all the Marks of being the genuine Effects of savage  Passion  and  Enthusiasm  So far are they from containing any regular  Series  of Facts that Facts are often  hinted  only while the mere  Celebration  of the Heroe forms the chief Weight and  Burthen  of the  Song  Lastly the universal Connexion of the  old Poetry  with  Melody  and the unvary'd Custom of  singing it  amounts to the strongest Proof that the mere End of  Memory  and  Tradition  could not be its original Cause For had the sole Intention of the Song been that of  Record only  a  mere Recitation  of the Verses would have answered the same Purpose And we may affirm it to be a  moral Impossibility  that an universal Union of Verse and Melody could have taken Place on this Foundation  Since therefore the Cause hitherto assigned seems alto∣gether inadequate to the Effect can we reasonably enter∣tain a Doubt in resolving it into that Principle which we have already found universally predominant in savage Life I mean the natural Passion for  Melody  and  Dance  which necessarily throws the accompanying  Song  into a  correspon∣dent Rythm  Hence the Use of Rythm and Verse must naturally arise in GREECE as in every other Country emerging from Barbarity because Melody Dance and Song made a principal Employment of their savage State And hence their earliest Histories must of course be writ∣ten in Verse because the Actions of their Gods and He∣roes made a principal Part of their Songs and therefore when the Use of Letters came among them these ancient Songs were naturally  first  recorded that is they became  their earliest  Histories  for the Information and Use of fu∣ture Times  As this Cause when viewed in itself seems amply and clearly to account for the Effect so it will receive farther Confirmation if we consider how naturally it removes all those Objections which load the Opinion here controvert∣ed For it neither requires nor supposeth any Power of  abstract Reasoning  among the  savage  Tribes but is the mere Effect of  Passion  and uncultivated Nature Its Uni∣versality therefore becomes highly probable because the Principles of savage Nature making Allowance for the Difference of Soil and Climate are every where the same The  Genius  of the ancient Songs of every Nation adds new Degrees of Evidence For they are generally irregular and enthusiastic and therefore the genuine Productions of  unlettered Enthusiasm  Lastly their universal Connexion with  Melody  and the unvary'd Practice of  singing  them comes up to a full and direct Proof of the Reality of the Cause now assigned  It must not be disguised that the most learned VOSSIUS was so struck with the Difficulty of accounting for this Appearance that he thinks it best to deny the Fact  "To me the contrary seems true that Prose was first writ∣ten and then Poetry Tis natural to walk on Foot before we mount on Horseback and it is certain that M  first  spoke  in  Prose  and  then  in  Numbers  We have nothing more ancient than the Writings of MOSES and these are in Prose with Songs intermixed  De Artis Poët Nat et Const  c i  "  On this Reasoning it may be remarked that although it be  certain that Men  spoke  in  Prose  before they  spoke  in  Verse  yet the Consequence follows not that therefore they must  write  in  Prose  before they  writ  in  Verse  The sole Question is what would be deemed best worth recording on the first Rise of the  writing Art  Surely the Actions and Celebrations of their Ancestors Gods and Heroes Now these we have already seen must naturally make the chief Subject of their festal Songs and therefore their  festal Songs  were of Course the  first  things  written  or  recorded  With respect to the Instance alledged by the learned Critic of the Writings of MOSES and the Practice of an∣cient EGYPT this when properly explained will confirm the Truth of the Cause here given MOSES we know was learned in all the Wisdom of the  Egyptians  EGYPT was in his Time become a  polished Nation  and therefore according to the natural Course of Things as will appear below  Prose  had been introduced before the Time of MOSES as it was afterwards in GREECE by HECATAEUS and others As to the intermixed Songs in the Writ∣ings of MOSES it is now a Point agreed among the Learned that they are written in  Measure  and correspond in all Respects with the Principle here delivered And that  Song  was the oldest Form of Composition in EGYPT we learn clearly from two ancient Writers The First in∣forms us that their Music and Songs had continued un∣changed for upwards of three thousand Years  PLATO  de Rep  l vii  The other gives a more particular Account of their Nature and Manner of being sung  "The first of the Priests who used to appear in the religious Procession was a  Choragus  Bard  or  Singer  who carried the Symbol of Music and could repeat by Heart the two first Books of MERCURY the first containing  Hymns  in Honour of the Gods the second containing  Sentences  or  Maxims  for the Conduct of a King  CLEMENS ALEXANDR  Stromat  l vi  "  "Their most ancient  Maxims Exhortations Pro∣verbs  or  Laws  were written in  Verse  " Having traced the Antiquity of  Song  and  poetic History  to its true and natural Cause the present Article will be of easy Discussion For as the Greek Songs and poetic Stories were fraught with the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes so  Maxims  of  Exhortation  which in barbarous Countries hold the Place of  Laws  must of Course make a Part of these public Songs must by Degrees be selected from them and in Time be appealed to as the  Standard  of  Right  and  Wrong  However as ARISTOTLE hath hinted at another Cause the slightest Conjecture of so great a Name must not pass unnoticed He puts the Question thus  "Why are many  Songs  called by the name of  Laws  Was it because be∣fore the Invention of the Art of Writing  Laws  were  sung  lest they should be  forgotten  Problem  Sect xix Art  He is followed in this Opinion by the learned Mr GOGUET in his late Book on Laws and Government  "The earliest Legislators set their Laws to Music that they might be more easily retained"  Tom  ii  L  i  Art    "  On this Passage it will be only necessary to remark First that the Opinion is delivered as a mere Conjecture Secondly that all the Difficulties which load the common Opinion concerning  the first Rise of  poetic History  lie equally heavy upon  this  And lastly that the same Solution leads us up to the true Cause on the natural Principles of the  savage SongFeast  This Solution may perhaps in the Opinion of some re∣ceive additional Confirmation from the concurrent Autho∣rity of CASAUBON who declares it his Belief though he assigns no Reason that the Songs called  Nomoi  were  Frag∣ments  of ancient Poetry which had been selected and pre∣served on Account of their Utility  In  LAERT    "Their earliest  religious Rites  were performed or ac∣companied by  Dance  and  Song  "The  Orgys  of BAC∣CHUS celebrated in this Manner were famed through all the Ages of Antiquity STRABO tells us that  "the  Greeks  retained the Custom  common  to the  Barbarians  of celebrating their Sacrifices to the Gods with Music consisting of Dance Melody and Song"  And highly extolls this Practice  "as tending to unite the Soul with God  STRABO l  "  PLUTARCH adds his Testimony and in∣forms us that in GREECE  "the first Application of Music was to religious Ceremonies in Honour of the Gods  PLUT  de Musica  "  All this flows naturally from the view we have given of savage Life and Manners For we have seen that the Praises of their Chiefs are the most general Topic of the savage Dance and Song and the  Grecian Gods  were no other than their  deceased Chieftains  "Their earliest  Oracles  were delivered in Verse and sung by the Priest or Priestess of the supposed God" The natural Cause of this Fact hath been assigned in the Article which corresponds with this The ancients knew  and confessed the Fact but were so entirely ignorant of the true Cause that they  laboured  more in this Point than even in accounting for the Rise of  poetic History  and  Laws  This will appear from PLUTARCH who hath written a Discourse on the following Question  "Why the PYTHIA no longer gives her Oracles in Verse"  Now before he assigned the Causes why this Practice of  Oracular Verse  had  ceased  it was natural that he should inquire how it first  began  And the Causes if such they may be called which he assigns are these  First  "The ancient Times produced a Race of Men who had naturally and from  bodily Temperament  a stronger Turn for Poetry"  Secondly  "There was a Time when instead of the Art of Writing Men used Metre Verse or Songs adapting History and other the weightiest Subjects to Poetry and Music" "Thus they celebrated the Gods and told their Fables in Verse some through the Force of  Genius  and others by the Power of  Custom  " "Therefore the God permitted the Application of Verse and Song to his Oracles and would not drive the Muses from his Tripod"  Thirdly  "The Utility of Poetry is in nothing more conspicuous than in its Assistance to the  Memory  by the Means of Num∣bers The Ancients had great Need of This beyond the Moderns because the Oracles referred to Persons Things and Places which were often unknown to them  PLUT  Diss Cur nunc Pythia non reddat oracula carmine  "  Thus the learned PLUTARCH whose weak Reasonings weak because he wanted Facts to lead him to the Truth  hardly need a Confutation For how came it so to pass that the first Race of Men were by  natural bodily Tempera∣ment  of a  stronger Turn  to  Poetry  How came it so to pass that they told their Fables in Verse some by the Force of  Genius  others by the Power of  Custom  These Affirma∣tions take for granted the very Point in Question  With Respect to the last Reason which the great Author assigns  "The Utility of Numbers as an Assistance to the Memory"  This when applied to  Oracles  is not only in∣cumbered with all the Difficulties which load the common System concerning the Origin of  poetic History  and  Laws  but is contrary to the clear Evidence of Facts which assure us that the earliest poetic Oracles were the Effect of  Enthu∣siasm  For APOLLO the God of  Music  was their Author The  Pythia  or  Priestless  was his  Vicegerent  and PAUSA∣NIAS informs us that PHAEMONOE the Sister of APOLLO was the first Priestess and that  "she delivered her pro∣phetic Inspirations with frantic Gestures  Dance  and in heroic  Verse  and  Song  PAUS  in Phocicis  "  PLUTARCH tells us farther concerning this  savage Heroine  that  "she is said to have  celebrated Herself  in her  Songs  and boasted that she should not cease to prophecy after her Death That she would ascend to the Moon and be metamorphosed into that Face which we see in the Moon's Body  Loco supra citato  "  These Passages compared with what hath here been delivered on the  savage SongFeasts  unveil the true Origin of the old  poetic Oracles  of GREECE Hence it appears why the God's Vicegerent was a  Woman  For his own  Sister  first assumed that Office and was naturally succeeded by one of  her own Sex  And the whole Account of her  SelfCelebra∣tions  her frantic  Gestures Verse  and  Song  contains a true Picture of an  enthusiastic Savage  For it appears above  "that Music Dance and Song are one of the common Modes of  Divination  among the savage IROQUOIS  See the Passage from LAFITAU  "  "Their  Melody  was  simple  and derived a consider∣able Part of its Power from its  Rythm  or Measure with∣out any Mixture of  artificial Composition  " Much hath been said on this Subject in support of the contrary Opi∣nion and with a View of proving that the ancient Melody which wrought such Wonders in GREECE was learned artificial and complex With others an Author no less considerable than Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE hath concurred in that Opinion  On Poetry  c  And all the Writers on this Subject seem to have given us a Parade of Words without any determinate Ideas annexed to them I shall therefore first assign the Reasons why it appears to me that we have no adequate Idea of the ancient GREEK Melody and then shall collect certain collateral Circum∣stances which may prove that although we are ignorant of its particular Nature yet that it was of a  simple  and  in∣artificial  Construction  First with Respect to the three  Genera  or  Kinds  of the  Greek Melody  as they are delivered and interpreted by the Writers on ancient Music they are incompatible with all those Intervals and Progressions of Sound which are agree∣able to the human Ear  As to the  Enharmonic  Kind it is confessedly imprac∣ticable For it is said to have proceeded by two  Dieses  or  QuarterNotes  with a stated intermixture of two whole Tones an Interval which no human Ear can precisely dis∣tinguish nor any human Voice precisely follow This Fact is so notorious and strikes so strongly on the Senses that the Bigots to the ancient Melody have generally been silent on it or at most have revered it as a profound My∣stery The ABBE DU BOS may be regarded as an Ex∣ception to this general Remark For He is of Opinion that the Progression of the Voice by  QuarterNotes  might be in general Use in the theatrical Declamation  Reflex Crit Part  iii c ix  To this it may be sufficient to reply that the ABBE confesseth himself ignorant of the Principles of Music  Ibid  and that this Opinion is a Proof of his being so The QuarterNote is a Progression which although an  Italian  CAS∣TRATO who hath laboured at this Refinement through his whole Life may  nearly  and  incidentally  accomplish yet even  He  shall never be able  strictly  to practise in the  general Course  of his Performance But it is a Progression equally impracticable to the Voice and shocking to the Ear of the Generality of Mankind  The  Chromatic  seems at first View to be more intelligi∣ble as it is generally said to have proceeded by  HalfNotes  of which the human Ear hath an adequate and pre∣cise Conception But This too on a nearer Examination will be found absolutely at Variance with that which We stile the  Chromatic  though by most modern Writers it is supposed to be the same and altogether in∣compatible with those Progressions of Sound into which a modern Voice can fall For the modern  Chromatic  Kind  is an  incidental  Ascent or Descent by HalfNotes with a variable Intervention of whole Notes introduced under certain Restrictions at the Composer's Will But the an∣cient  Chromatic  as delivered by the Writers on this Sub∣ject was an  unvaried  Progression by two  HalfNotes  and a  Third  either  greater  or  less  See ALYPIUS at the End of the  Phaenomena  of ARATUS To whom I refer for the Truth of these Remarks on the three  Genera    The  Diatonic  Kind according to the common Concep∣tion of it is perfectly understood and is generally said to be the same with that in which our modern Music is com∣monly composed Yet nothing is less true than this For our common Scale is a Progression of whole Notes with the Intermixture of two half Notes only and these at the Distance of a  fifth  from each other in the  sharp  Key and a  fourth  from each other in the  flat  Key Whereas in the ancient Diatonic Scale it is quite otherwise For There Here  one Semitone  and  two whole Tones  are ordained to succeed each other  invariably  A Circumstance utterly incompatible with the modern  Diatonic  Scale  The Consequence drawn from these Reasonings is not that the Ancients talked or practised absurdly or that the Moderns want Ears or Understanding but only This that we do not adequately understand the Terms  What leads me farther to believe this is a Circumstance in the  Spartan  Decree against TIMOTHEUS given at large below where it is said that he corrupted the  Simplicity  of the  Enharmonic  and introduced the  Refinements  of the  Chromatic  Now this is an absolute Contradiction to All that we understand concerning the Nature of these two Kinds For as the  Diatonic  which proceeds by whole  Tones is more simple than the  Chromatic  which proceeds by  HalfTones  so This in its Turn is more simple than the  Enharmonic  which is said to have proceeded by  Quar∣terTones  All which is in direct Contradiction to the Tenor of the  Spartan  Decree  Secondly with Regard to the various  Modes  of ancient Melody we are often as much in the dark We read of no less than fifteen introduced at different Periods but the Commentators on the ancient Writers upon this Sub∣ject are at Variance with each other concerning the Na∣ture and Use of these different Modes Some are of Opi∣nion that the Difference lay in the Degree of  Gravity  or  Acuteness  only Others maintain that the Mode signified the  Rythm  or  Measure  Others again that the Essence of the  Mode  consisted in a  different Species  of  Diapason  There is Reason to believe that the Word was used at va∣rious Times and by different Writers in all these Senses and that each of these Authors may be right in his Turn From the Description of an Instrument given by ATHE∣NAEUS it appears that by  Mode  was sometimes meant  Gravity  or  Acuteness  of Sound For he tells us that the Musician had three Lyres placed on a moveable Tripod which turned on an Axis and that by whirling it round with his Foot he could instantly play in three various Modes  L xiv  That  Mode  was sometimes used for  Measure  seems evident because in a Fragment of an ancient Author cited by ATHENAEUS we read that a  Hymn  was writ∣ten in the  Lydian Mode  Ibid  which can only mean the  Phrygian  or  Dorian Measure  And as  Mode  was ap∣plied to Numbers so was it likewise to  Dance  The  Ionici Motus  which ancient Writers speak of are a clear  Proof of This That  Mode  was used in the third of these Acceptations as a particular  Species  of  Diapason  hath been made clear by a late Writer in a judicious and accurate Treatise  By Sir FR EYLES STILES  Thus by the promiscuous Use of the Word Mode signifying either  Pitch Measure  or  Species  of  Diapason  it hath come to pass that some times the Signi∣fication of the Word is  clear  at others it is only  probable  often it is  obscure  and  doubtful  Thirdly to complete our Ignorance of the particular Nature of their Melody the Construction of their Musical Instruments is unknown We only know that the Chords of the Lyre were augmented gradually from  four  to  forty  but whether the Strings ascended by QuarterNotes HalfNotes whole Notes or by larger Intervals of all this we know nothing certain Our Ignorance of their Pipes or Flutes is not less remarkable Commentators and Critics ring Changes on their single double oblique righthanded and lefthanded Flutes but what was their precise Make Tone Compass or Powers these Gentlemen cannot with any Certainty inform us The learned ISAAC VOSSIUS is one of the warmest Champions for the Excellence of an∣cient Instruments but whoever reads him without Parti∣ality will find all his Endeavours amount to no more than what is here affirmed  De Poem Cantu  c    Since therefore the particular Nature and Construction of the ancient Melody is utterly unknown to us we must have Recourse to collateral Proofs drawn from Facts which were connected with this unknown Melody and from These we may I think indirectly arrive so far at a Know∣ledge of its  general  Character as to conclude with Cen∣tainty  that in the  early  Periods in which  Music  boasted its  greatest Power  the ruling Character of the  Melody  was that of  Simplicity  and that it derived a chief Part of its  Force  from its mere  Rythm  or  Measure  Simplicity was its ruling Character because we find that  Music  had  then  its greatest Power when the  Melody  was most  confined  in its  Compass  MERCURY was the In∣ventor of the  Lyre  which had but  four  Strings and these were stretched on a Turtle's Shell  PAUSANIAS l ix  AM∣PHION was his Disciple and increased the Number of Strings to  seven  Ibid  APOLLO contented himself with the same Compass of Notes and so did ORPHEUS  Ibid  This Number of Strings continued to be established by Law at SPARTA so late as the Age of TIMOTHEUS who attempted an Innovation of  four  more and was punished for it  See the  Spartan  Decree against TIMOTHEUS given at large below  Yet all the mighty Effects and Powers of  Music  which we read of in ancient GREECE arose within this Period and while the  Melody  was confined within this small Compass  The Lyre therefore in its most ancient Forms being in∣capable either of a great Variety or a multifarious Com∣bination of Sounds a strong Probability ariseth from its very Nature that  Counterpoint  or an artificial Composition in  various Parts  was altogether unknown It appears to me from many Passages of ancient Authors compared together but too long to insert here that the Ancients sung and played first in Unisons Octaves and Fifteenths then in Thirds and Tenths and in the later Periods in Fourths and Fifths as appears from PLUTARCH though in ARISTOTLE's Time it is evident these last were not  practised It is likewise evident that in the later Periods the  instrumental Accompanyment  was different from the  Song  yet this only in the Way of  Division  upon the  fun∣damental Notes  Farther than these Methods of  redoubling  or  dividing  the same Melody I find nothing like Compo∣sition in  various Parts  Oh the contrary there are many Reasons which may convince us that nothing like the modern  Counterpoint  was known to the Ancients The Silence of all their Musical Writers collected by MEIBOMIUS on this great Article is a Proof sufficient that they were ignorant of it Their Divisions of the musical Art are precise and systema∣tical and therefore if this had made a Part of it as its Rules must have been more complex than those of any other Branch beyond all Doubt they would have been distinctly treated of  The same Consequence seems clearly to arise from a Passage in ARISTOTLE who says that  "it is much easier to keep the  Time  in Music when a Number sing toge∣ther than when a single Voice only sings  Probl  Sect xix  "  Which is true if we suppose a numerous Choir to sing the same Part because one Voice tends to correct the Inequalities of an∣other but in direct Contradiction to the Truth if we suppose them to sing in Counterpoint because here the various Parts have a Tendency to confound each other  Their Ignorance of Counterpoint appears farther from hence that no Difference is remarked between the Com∣positions for the  Flute  and those for the  Lyre  with Respect to the  Multiplicity  of  Parts  One Instrument they used which had two Strings to every Note and these two were tuned in  thirds  to each other This Instrument was called  the  Magadis  and even this distant Approach towards playing in Counterpoint was regarded as a Thing so sin∣gular that to play in  thirds  was called  If there∣fore any other Kind of Performance had been used more complex than this it must have been noted as a Circum∣stance still more singular  It appears farther that in HOMER's Hymn to MER∣CURY the Poet represents APOLLO as holding his Lyre in one Hand and playing with a  Plectrum  with the other In an ancient Sculpture which represents the Deification of HOMER some of the Figures which dance are at the same Time playing on the Lyre which they hold with one Hand and strike with the other Thus too when SOPHOCLES played on the Lyre and at the same Time led the Dance  Deipnosoph  l i  he must have managed his Instrument in the same Manner And again it appears that even in the latter Periods the most celebrated Lyrists played with  one Plectrum  Ibid l xiv  They sometimes touched the String with a  Plectrum  sometimes with the  Finger  But that the Custom of playing with the  Plectrum  was the more ancient appears from a curious Fact related by H STEPHENS from PLUTARCH  "that  Spartans  punished a Lyrist for the  Innovation  of playing with his  Finger  "  Thes Ling Graec Voc    VIRGIL introduceth MUSAEUS as playing in both these Ways in the  Elyfian  Fields  "Nunc  Digito  nunc  Pectine  pulsat eburno"  But this proves little more than that  Both  were in Use in the Time of VIRGIL'Tis certain that on the first rude Formation of Instruments the  Plectrum  would give the more clear and effectual Stroke As Instruments grew more more delicate the  Finger  would come into Use This as will appear be∣low Art explains the Foundation of the  Spartan  Conduct  Now all these Circumstances center in the Proof of this that the Melody which they played was  single  We may farther observe that their musical  Notation  so far as it is supposed to be understood generally implies a  single and that a very inartificial Species of Composition Nay the Letters which composed their musical Notation seem very inadequately to express even a  single  Part did not the  Measure  of the  Verse  in some Degree fix that of the  Melody  Add to all these Arguments this farther Confirmation that their Poets who were generally at the same Time Warriours Priests or Statesmen not only composed the Melody to their own Verses but in the early Periods played and sung them at their Festivals And that People of all Ages and Degrees were commonly able to bear a Part in the Chorus both in public and private Entertainments All these concurrent Circumstances center in one sufficient and satisfactory Proof that their Melody was not only  single  but of the most  simple Construction  One Kind of  Addition  did undoubtedly in many Instances take Place I mean that of the  Tympanum  the  Sistrum  or the  Cymbal  added as an unvaried  Groundwork  and accom∣modated to the Measure of the  ruling Melody  But this was no more than the modern  Drum  added to the  Fife  or  Trumpet  the  Tabor  to the  Pipe  or the  Drone  to the  Bag∣pipe  A Kind of Addition which we find in the Music of almost every barbarous Country  Since therefore it appears that the Force of the ancient  Greek  Melody consisted neither in its  Compass  its  Multi∣solicity  of  Parts  nor its  artificial  Construction let us now proceed to consider the only Circumstance from which its chief Power could arise I mean its  Rythm  or  Measure  That this was its real Source may be evident from the following Considerations  First The  Greek  Language was admirably fitted for a various and powerful  Rythm  or  Measure  by its Variety of  Feet  which when thrown into all their different Combi∣nations formed such a Variety of  Numbers  as gave Room for an equal and correspondent Variety of  Measure  in the annexed  Melody  beyond any other Language in the known World When therefore such a Language offered itself as an Assistant to the Musician's Art it was altogether natu∣ral that he should accommodate his Melody to the peculiar and happy Genius of his Native Tongue  Secondly such a Melody as this marked by strong Changes and Varieties of Measure must have greater Ef∣fects than the most extensive or most artificial Melody when unassisted by it This argument is well pursued by the learned ISAAC VOSSIUS I shall therefore give it in his own Words the rather because it is the most judicious and philosophic Passage in his whole Work and contains as it were the  Kernel  of a large Tract a considerable Part of which it must be owned may justly be thrown aside as  Husk  and  Shell  "Wherefore I cannot enough wonder at those who in the present and past Age have written on Music that while they diligently explained other Things they should either have said nothing on  Rythm  or else written in such a Manner as to prove themselves ignorant of its Nature They confine themselves entirely to  Counterpoint  neglecting that which is principal in MelodyFor certainly as neither an  Unit  can produce  Number  nor a  single Word  make  Sense  so neither can any  single Sound  separately considered have any  Power  Or if it hath it must be very inconsiderable For what Effect in moving the Passions can arise from the Collision of Stones or Wood or even from the striking of one String  if  Numbers  and  Rythm  be wanting and we hear nothing but a mere Sound  The learned Writer is mistaken in this Paragraph The mere Sound of  Thunder  excites  Fear  other Sounds excite  Sorrow  others  Joy  See the next Article  Or if we compound various Sounds and these be even harmonic and concordant not even This will produce any Effect Such an Harmony of Sounds may please the Ear but the Pleasure will only be such as if Words were agreeably spoken which are either unmeaning or not understood That the Soul may be affected it is necessary that the Sound should imply or bring before us something which we can comprehend That Sounds therefore may have their full Effect the Melody must be animated by such Move∣ments as contain in themselves the  Representations  or  Images  of those Things which we mean to  express  or  imitate  by Song And This if we can do we may be sure to command the Passions of the Soul But that we may indeed catch and call forth these  Images  we must employ that Variety of Musical  Feet  in which are so fully contained all the several Kinds of Movements that no Affection can be conceived which they do not most exactly express For the Expression of light and voluble Motions as of the Dances of  Satyrs  the  Pyrrichius  and  Tribrachys  are proper The  grave  and  slow  are expressed by the  Spondee  and  Molossus  Whatever is  soft  and  tender  the  Trochee  and sometimes the  Amphibrachys  will de∣scribe which itself moves with a broken and effeminate Pace The  Iambic  is fierce and  vehement  and the  Anapaest  nearly of the same Nature as it imitates violent and warlike Motions If we mean to express what is  chearful  and  joyous  we must employ the  Dactyl  whose  Movements are of a correspondent Nature Whatever is  hard  and  rugged  the  Antispast  will happily describe If we require Numbers that may express  Fury  and  Mad∣ness  not only the  Anapaest  is at Hand but what is still more powerful the  Paeon quartus  Of these various Measures artificially combined did the ancient  Greek  and  Roman  Music consist And while this flourished so long did Music maintain its Empire over the Passions  VOSSIUS  de Poem Cantu et Viribus Rythmi  p  "  Thus the learned VOSSIUS Whose Admiration of the Rythm of the ancient Melody leads him into some false Conclusions as will appear below In the mean Time this general Exhibition of the Genius of the Greek  Numbers  may stand as a farther accumulative Proof that the Power of the ancient  Melody  which was universally accommo∣dated to this  Variety  of  expressive Numbers  lay chiefly in its  Rythm  or  Measure  Lastly these Arguments are much confirmed by the ex∣press Testimony of PLUTARCH who speaking of the Variations which the Genius of ancient Music had under∣gone in the Progress of Time says  "If we compare An∣tiquity with the present Times we shall find that in ancient Days there was a great Variety  Measure  and this Variety often employed For in that early Period the Variety of  Feet  and  Time  was more highly esteemed  We  now study and attend to Variety of  Modes  the  An∣cients  to Variety of  Rythm  or  Measure  De Musica  "  This Change he regards as one of the Corruptions of Melody he gives an Account of the Inventors of the several  new Modes  MELANIPPIDES PHILOXENUS TIMOTHEUS and others and insists that the Art which formerly had such Power in  the Education of Youth was now sunk into a mere Amuse∣ment of the Theatre  De Musica  A clear and full Indication that the ancient  Greeks  relied on  Measure  or  Rythm  for the  Force  of their  Melody  and that as it grew  more arti∣ficial  it grew  less powerful  These Facts fully coincide with the Reasons given above on which this Article is founded  "Because a Simplicity of Melody whose Power arose from mere Rythm or Measure was most suited to the Powers of the first barbarous Legislators or Bards as well as to the Capacity of the surrounding People"  "The Force of this simple Melody was much in∣creased by the Power of  early Association  and  continued Habit  For This by appropriating certain Sounds to certain Subjects raised their Melody into a Kind of natural and expressive Language of the Passions"In the first rude Essays towards an expressive Melody in bar∣barous Countries certain imperfect Modes of Sound must of Course be applied as being expressive of certain Subjects or Passions The succeeding Generation will be naturally bred up to a like Application of the same Sounds Hence these Modes of Melody though  imperfect  in Expression being impressed on  infant Minds  with all the Force of an early Application must acquire a Power over  These  which unaccustomed Minds can never feel Thus certain Sounds being appropriated by Use and having become the com∣mon Indications of Grief Terror Joy Pity Rage or any other Passion will naturally excite their respective Affections among those who have adopted them while a Hearer from another Country whose Associations and Habits are different will be  little  or if at all perhaps very  differently  affected by them LAFITAU's Account of the Music of the  Iroquois  is a clear Confirmation of this Truth  "The Music and Dance of the Americans have something in them extremely  barbarous  which at first  disgusts  We grow  reconciled  to them  by Degrees  and in the  End  partake of them with  Pleasure  As to the Savages themselves they are  fond  of them even to  Distraction  See above Sect ii  "  What we are told of the  Swiss  Song gives additional Con∣firmation to this Principle This Song which to foreign Ears is uncouth and barbarous hath such an Effect on the Natives of SWITZERLAND among whom it is generally taught and impressed on the infant Mind that it is forbid to be sung among their Regiments hired in the Service of other Nations lest it should tempt them to desert and re∣turn to their own Country The  Jews Chinese Germans French Italians  have all some peculiar Appropriations of a similar Nature which gives their native Music a general Power which no other Music can ever obtain Among ourselves the Sound of  Bells Drums Organs Trumpets  have all an Appropriation of the same Nature And a Highlander has the same  warlike  Ideas annexed to the Sound of a  Bagpipe  an Instrument which an  Englishman  derides as the  Englishman  has to that of a  Trumpet  or a  Fife  MELODY therefore is to be considered as a  relative  thing founded in the particular Associations and Habits of each People and by Custom like Language annexed to their Sentiments and Passions Thus it becomes the natural Vehicle of these Sentiments and Passions but a Vehicle which can never extend farther than to Those upon whom such particular Impressions have been made This added to the Power of  Rythm  affords a natural Solution to the  Difficulties raised concerning the Power of the  Greek  Melody For as it was taught and impressed on the infant Mind by early and continued Application as will imme∣diately appear so it naturally acquired the Power of a  Language  of the  Passions  which with Respect to other Nations if it now existed it would not possess  There is a collateral Argument often urged in Favour of the artificial Excellence of the ancient  Greek Melody  and drawn from what we know of the Elegance and Perfection of ancient  Greek Sculpture  But the Weakness of this Argument will appear from the Principles here given the Effects of the two Arts being by no means  parallel  but rather contrary to each other The  Excellence  of  Sculp∣ture  is the Effect of repeated Experience which refers itself to the Works of Nature as to its Archetype And the Pleasure arising from the Contemplation of this Art consists in seeing the Perfection of the Imitation and is the Result of a fine Taste founded on a correct Judgment But the  Force  of  Melody  on the Passions depends not on its artificial Construction or Elegance but solely on its being adapted to the Feelings Passions and Conceptions of the Hearer be they just or false polished or barbarous Hence we shall find that the  Force  of the two Arts will be generally in an  inverse Proportion  For the  Attention  to  Sculpture  being founded on a  reflex Act  of the Under∣standing will always increase with increasing Taste and Knowledge But the  Power  of  Melody  being founded in  Passion  will  there  be most general and strong where Fear Joy Wonder Terror and Astonishment are most easily and most frequently excited And it is certain these natu∣ral Passions are not so common in a State highly polished as in that of Barbarity or simple Civilization 'Tis granted  indeed nay insisted on that the ancient Melody grew more artificial in the later Periods But the same Authors who inform us of this  ARISTOTLE PLUTARCH and others  assure us that its Power was greatest in the early and barbarous Times that this Power continued longest in that Society which continued longest in Barbarity I mean the Commonwealth of SPARTA and that as it grew more artificial it degenerated every where into a mere Amusement and lost its Influence on the Passions and the Mind  "Their  Songs  were of a  legislative  Cast and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or History of their own Country contained the essential Parts of their  religious political  and  moral  Systems" We have seen above that the Celebration of their deceased Heroes became naturally a  religious Act  That the  Maxims  or  Exhortations  inter∣mixed with these and founded on the Example of their HeroeGods became of Course the  Standard  of  Right  and  Wrong  that is the Foundation of  private Morals  and of  public Law  and thus the whole Fabric of their  Religion Morals  and  Polity  arose naturally from their  SongFeasts  in their Progress from  savage  to  civilized  Life  The Records that remain concerning the  Bards  of an∣cient GREECE unite in confirming this Principle Of this illustrious Catalogue LINUS was perhaps the first He writ the Exploits of the first BACCHUS and sung the Generation of the World and the Rise of Things  DIODORUS l iii and LAERTIUS  PAMPHO is supposed to have been his Disciple And He composed  Hymns  in Honour of the Gods and sung the Rape of PROSERPINE by PLUTO  PAUSANIAS  in Baeoticis    The next great poetic and musical Sage was ORPHEUS He is said to have sung of  Chaos  and  Creation  and a Variety of other Subjects  religious  and  philosophical  SUIDAS  in Orpheo  Some fine Fragments remain under his Name but there is Reason from some internal Marks in the Composition to believe them spurious  MUSAEUS is said to have been the Disciple of ORPHEUS He too writ  Hymns  and  Prophecies  and sung the Motions of the  Stars  and the Battles of the  Giants  LAERTIUS  in Proaem  THAMYRIS was not less distinguished by the  legislative  Genius of his Songs For he was not only the Author of a  Titan's War  but celebrated the Gods in  Hymns  and sung the  Generation  of the  World  SUIDAS  in Tham    These are the most celebrated  Bards  of ancient GREECE whose Songs have perished in the Wreck of Time If we come down to the most famous of those whose Writ∣ings have been preserved we shall find their Songs com∣posed in the same  legislative  Style and Genius  HESIOD seems to stand at the Head of these in the Order of Time And his  Theogony  is a living Witness how far HIS  legislative  Turn accords to the Principles here deliver∣ed He gives in Form the  Generation  of all the  Gods  of GREECE and mixeth his Narration with their  Acts  and  Praises  HOMER appears next in the Order of Time And in his unrivaled Songs we find the  Religion Polities  and  Manners  of ancient GREECE displayed with all the Ap∣pearances of Truth because delivered with all their  Imper∣fections  During the early Periods of Civilization the  legislative  Art is always of an  imperfect  Form In the rude Progress of barbarous Manners the  moral  Ideas are  confined  and little distinguished If the People be fierce and war∣like as were the Tribes of GREECE Strength Courage Agility and Cunning are the ruling Virtues Hence it follows that the Pictures both of  Gods  and  Men  will ac∣cord to this Principle in such a Period And hence many of the Fables of HOMER himself were of a Cast so different from the Spirit of  improved Legislation  that PLATO re∣fused them Admittance into his Republic  De Rep  l ii iii  It is generally affirmed and believed that PLATO was for banishing Poetry without Exception from his perfect Republic So far is this from being true that he affirms directly  "that he only means to banish That which is pernicious but to retain That which is useful"    De Rep  l x  Nay he hath written a whole Book    De Leg  l ii  to prove the Utility of  Music  in the Education of Youth Through the Course of which if is evident that in His Idea  Poetry  makes the most essential Part of  Music    And here while we acknowledge HOMER as the supreme Painter of natural Manners and of a Genius truly  legislative  according to the Principles of his Time critical Justice de∣mands that we take off some of those false Colourings of Praise which both Ancients and Moderns have lavished on him in Regard to the Excellence of the  Morals  which he taught HORACE it is well known hath set him above the old Philosophers as a Teacher of all Virtue  Qui quid pulchrum  c  PLUTARCH in his Life of HOMER hath advanced the same Positions But whoever will examine his Poems with an impartial Eye will find a very deficient Plan of Morals prevailing through them There is not the least Vestige or Appearance of those abstract general Principles of moral Excellence or Blame which take Place in the more refined  Periods of social and polished Life His Gods and Heroes fight and plunder kill and ravish boast and lye are generous fierce prodigal rapacious cruel or unrelenting without much Controul from  moral Ideas  within or from a  refined legislative Art  without  It is remarkable that PLUTARCH after labouring in vain through many Pages to prove that the Principles of all the Virtues are to be found in HOMER is forced at length to conclude  "It is true indeed that  bad  Actions and Principles are intermixed and described in the same Manner which was necessary for the Introduction of the Sublime and Wonderful But this only makes the Contrast the stronger so that the Reader is necessarily led to  select  the  Good  and  reject  the  Bad  In Vita  HOMERI  "  But as this great Ancient along with others allow that neither the  good  nor the  bad  is actually recommended by the Poet the Consequence follows that the Reader if so disposed may as easily  elect  the  bad  and  reject  the  good  That HO∣MER was a compleat  natural Painter  of the Ways of Men but an imperfect moral Painter from the  unpolished Genius  and  barbarous Legislation  of the Age in which he lived  The Inconsistency of a late learned Writer on this Sub∣ject is too glaring to pass unnoticed He justly criticiseth VIRGIL as being shackled by the refined Manners of his Times and the political Forms of his Country With equal Truth he displays the free Vein of Nature which runs through HOMER's Poems  "The natural  Greek  in HOMER's Days covered none of his Sentiments He frankly owned the Pleasures of Love and Wine He told how voraciously he eat when he was hungry and how  horribly he was frighted when he saw an approaching Danger He looked on  no means  as  base  to escape it and was  not  at all  ashamed  to relate the  Trick  or  Fetch  that had brought him off""Even AGAMEMNON is not ashamed to own his Passion for a captive Maid in the Face of the whole Army He tells them plainly that he likes her much better than his Lady the beautiful CLYTEMNESTRA of the prime Grecian Nobility  Enquiry into the Life and Writings of  HOMER p  "  All this Criticism is just and fine But who can but wonder at what follows  "His Work is the great Drama of Life acting in our View  There  we see  Virtue  and  Piety praised  public  Religion promoted Temperance Forgiveness  and Fortitude  rewarded  Truth and Cha∣racter followed and accordingly find it standing at the Head of human Writings  Ibid  "  As a  natural Picture  of Manners its  Superiority  is  acknowledged  As a  moral Picture  its  Defects  are no less  conspicuous  Where is  Virtue  praised Is it in the Conduct of the natural  Greek  who looked upon  no means  as  base  to escape Danger  Nor  was at all  ashamed  to relate the  Trick  or  Fetch  that brought him off Is it in the Conduct of AGAMEMNON who declared his  Passion  for a  Captive  and his  Neglect  of his  Queen  in the  Face  of the  whole Army  Where is  Piety  praised Is it in the Foot of DIOMEDE who attacked and wounded one of the GodsWhere is public Religion in the improved Sense promoted Is it in his Descriptions of  Heaven  and  Hell  In the  first  of which the  Adultery  of MARS and VENUS is treated as a  Jest  by all the  Gods  In the  second  the Souls of the  best Men  are represented wandering  forlorn  and  comfortless  In all this the Poet is not blameable He painted what he saw and believed and painted truly The Fault lay in the Opinions and Manners of the Times In the Defects of an early and barbarous Legislation which had but halfcivilized Mankind  Our great  Translator  of HOMER hath often departed from the Character of his Original in this Respect He hath frequently thrown in fine  moral  Traits of which there is not the least Footstep in his  Author  By this in∣deed he hath given us a Poem more accommodated to the Taste of our own Times but hath lost the native and un∣polished Simplicity which distinguishes the venerable old Prince of  Epic Song  The next great  legislative Bard  whom I shall now men∣tion was PINDAR At the Period when He flourished the Fortune and Glory of GREECE were rising to their Meridian The  legislative  Arts had now obtained a higher Degree of  Perfection  And accordingly we find in his sublime  Songs  the fullest and most perfect Union of salutary Principles thrown out in Maxims religious political and moral No Vices or Imperfections either of Gods or Men are there applauded or palliated nor ever recited but to be condemned All Actions are praised or censured according to their Influence on the public Happiness The Intent of these  Songs  sung by their Author at their most ge∣neral and renowned Festivals was to inspire his Countrymen with the Love of Glory and of Virtue To this great End he animated them not only by the Example and Praise of the Victors in the  Olympic Games  but ascended into past Times and drew from thence the shining Acts of Gods and Heroes who had distinguished themselves by Valour Arts or Virtues  And here in Justice to this great Poet we must observe that PINDAR's Songs considered in this  legislative  View afford an easy and internal Solution of a Difficulty which hath at all Times embarrassed his Commentators and Cri∣tics who have ever censured his seeming Irregularities and sudden Flights from the  declared Heroe  of his Poem to  Gods  and  deceased Chieftains  But on the Principle here given it appears that the Heroe of the Day was but the  occasional  and  incidental  Subject of his Ode The main Intent was the Praise of his Country's Gods and Heroes who had signalized themselves by Actions beneficent and great When therefore he seems to  wander  into the Cele∣bration of  their  Names he is indeed  severely true  to the  leading Subject  of his  Song  The very Objection itself as it is urged by some of PINDAR's Critics leads us to the Solution here given A French Writer thus expresseth it  "He is not always content with praising the  Country  of his  Heroe  he pro∣ceeds to celebrate the  great Men  which it had  produced  and then it is that he  wanders indeed  So when his  Heroe  is of EGINA after having celebrated the Isle in  general  he descends to  particulars  and praiseth AEACUS PE∣LEUS TELAMON ACHILLES and NEOPTOLEMUS AJAX and TEUCER who all  sprung  from  thence  He mentions CYPRUS SALAMINE PHTHIA EPIRUS which were  Colonies founded by these Heroes  Hist de l' Acad Royale des Inscrip  t v p  "  There cannot be a better Illustration of the  Solution  here given than this very  Objection  thus presented at large  There is a fabulous Story told which strongly confirms the Principle here delivered and proves it to have been  the Opinion of ancient GREECE that a Part of these festal Celebrations was due to the Gods and Heroes and that it was even a  Crime  to  omit  their Praises  "The Poet SIMO∣NIDES having agreed with an  Olympic Victor  called SCOPAS for an Ode of Celebration SIMONIDES ac∣cording to Custom went largely into the Praise of CASTOR and POLLUX On this SCOPAS gave him the  third Part  of the Price and told him that he must apply to CASTOR and POLLUX for the Remainder SCOPAS being afterwards at a Banquet with SIMONIDES Word was brought that  two Men  covered with Sweat and Dust were at the Door and desired to speak with SIMONIDES He went out of the Chamber and imme∣diately the Roof fell in and buried SCOPAS in the Ruins  CICERO  de Oratore  l ii QUINTIL l xi c  "  The three  Greek  TRAGEDIANS are the last of this il∣lustrious Catalogue of legislative Bards And their Writ∣ings though very different in their Style and Manner yet all unite in holding forth the leading Principles of the Greek Religion Polity and Morals  ESCHYLUS who stands first in Order of Time partakes much of the rude Genius of the early Periods His Imagery and Sentiments are great his Style rugged and abrupt and of a Cast so totally different from that of HOMER that it is astonishing to hear the Critics one after another affirming that HOMER was his Model  See this Point considered below Art  His Writings present to us all the Characters of a sublime original and uncultivated Genius which scorned any other Tutoress than  Nature  He was Himself a great Warriours  and his warlike Genius threw itself out in Subjects that were grand and terrible Hence his Tragic Songs abound with the most gloomy and tremendous Exploits of the Gre∣cian Heroes striking the Soul with Admiration Astonish∣ment and Terror  SOPHOCLES appeared next of a more sedate and tem∣pered Majesty He improved on ESCHYLUS both in  Plan  and  Morals  For the  legislative Arts  were now advancing at ATHENS with great Rapidity No Wonder therefore that the Disciple conquered his Master when he had the improving Sense of his Country to elevate and inlarge his Genius But still the Gods and Heroes of GREECE were the constant Subject of his Song  EURIPIDES considered in the legislative View was on a Level with his Masters with Respect to the Subject of his Tragedies for these were always drawn from the  Grecian Gods  or  Heroes  but possessed himself of the Advantage which the still improving State of his Country gave him For  Philosophy  was now in its Ascendant The  Poet  was the  Disciple  of an eminent  Sage  Hence the Genius of EURIPIDES carried the legislative Power of Song to its last Perfection and threw itself out in such a Variety of Maxims  political  and  moral  as far outwent the Art of his Predecessors  Such then through the various Ages of ancient GREECE was the legislative Genius of their  Songs  which in their several Periods contained the leading Principles of their  Re∣ligion Morals  and  Polity  and thus became the natural and proper Object of the public Attention and Regard  "MUSIC in its more extensive Meaning that is in∣cluding  Melody  and the  Song  See above Art  either with or without the  Dance  " for this last as will appear below  See Art  was soon separated from the other two for an important End "bore a principal and essential Part in the Education of their Children" The Authorities which prove this are abundant and even superfluous Some of the principal may suffice  "Among the Ancients" says the wise PLUTARCH "Music in Theatres was not known They employed all their Art in the Worship of the Gods and the Education of their Youth  PLUT  de Musica  "  The same Author gives several Instances of musical Education in CRETE and SPARTA and tells us that  "By Music the young Men were taught to  abstain  from every thing  indecent  in  Word  and  Deed  and to observe  Decorum Temperance  and Regularity  Ibid  "  Again  "Music was the Foun∣dation of a virtuous Education because it was allied with  Philosophy Morals  and  Heroism  ACHILLES was taught by CHIRON and played and sung the  great Actions  of  Heroes  Ibid  "  Elsewhere he informs us that  "the  Spartans  in their  Songs  talked high of what  Exploits  they had performed And that the  young Men  echoed back their  Triumphs  in their Songs proclaiming their Reso∣lution to  equal  the Valour of their  Forefathers  In Lycurgo  "  Such was the Nature of ancient  Music  when applied to Education and not a mere Proficiency in the  playing  or  singing  Art as it hath been generally misunderstood and ignorantly ridiculed by many Moderns Hence it was  that their greatest Captains and Statesmen studied Music as an essential Part of Education Thus PERICLES was taught by DAMON who was likewise supposed to have in∣structed him in Politics  PLUT  in Pericle  Thus EPAMINONDAS was eminent in Music though the  Roman  Historian  CORN  Nepos in Praefat Vit  EPAMINOND  who informs us of the Fact speaks like one who knew not the Nature and Extent of Music among the earlier Greeks  PLATO confirms these Authorities and recites more at large the particular Method of Education used in ancient GREECE  "What then is the most proper Discipline Will it not be difficult to find a better than what was long ago established One Part of this is the  Gymnastic  which relates to the  Body  the other is  Music  which relates to the  Mind  This Discipline ought first to be∣gin with  Music  and when we speak of  Music  we in∣clude the  Subject Words  or  Song  Of this there are two Kinds the  true  and  fabulous  Both ought to be ap∣plied but the fabulous first Yet the  Fables  ought to be  regulated  lest the young Mind being tinctured with such as are improper it should be necessary at a more adult Age to counterwork the first Impressions  De Repub  l ii  "  He then proceeds to a particular Detail of Fables proper and improper in the Work of Education pointing out what ought to be admitted or rejected In another Dialogue he speaks again of the Remains of this Method of Instruction which were found among the wiser Sort even in his own Times although in general as will appear below  Art    Music  was then totally  corrupted  "The Parents commit their Children to the Care of Masters and are more  sollicitous about their  Morals  than their Proficiency in  Learning  or  playing  on the  Lyre  As soon as they have attained a Knowledge of Letters and are able to under∣stand what they read the Masters give them the Works of the  best Poets  to peruse and get by Heart especially such as contain the  Praises  of their  Forefathers  renowned for  great Actions  that the Boys may be fired with an  Emulation  to  imitate  their  Virtues  The MusicMasters are above all things careful to give them Habits of Wis∣dom and Temperance and to see that they commit no unworthy Action As soon as they have learnt to play on the Lyre the Master proceeds to instruct them in the  Songs  of the most famous  Poets  These they  sing  to the Lyre and the Preceptors endeavour to bring their Boys to a Love of the Rythms and Numbers that by this Discipline they may be more  mild modest  and  orderly  in their  Manners  and become  useful  both in  Speech  and  Action  In Protag  "  Suitable to this Method of Education is PLATO's Di∣rection in his Book of Laws  "Therefore the Legislator will take Care that the Youth's Mind may be so formed that his  Pleasures  and  Displeasures  may  accord  to the  Laws  and to the Taste of  mature Age  And if it be necessary he will compel the Poet to describe the  Actions  of  brave  and  good  Men and to compose such  Numbers  and  Harmonies  as may be suited to the Subjects  De Legibus  l ii  "  In the same Place he assigns a particular Reason for this Method of Education  "Because the youthful Mind is not apt to attend to serious Study therefore the  pleasing Vehicle  of  Song  is to be administered  Ibid  "  He then pro∣ceeds  even to the particular moral Maxims which ought to be instilled by the Poet and Musician on the Principles of a wise Legislator  As these Authorities are clear and decisive we may here properly obviate an Error of the excellent MONTESQUIEU arising from his Misapprehension of the true Nature and Extent of ancient Music He with most other Writers supposeth it to have consisted according to the modern Acceptation of the Word in the single Circumstance of  Melody  In Consequence of this when he comes to in∣quire why the ancient  Greeks  applied Music so universally in the Education of their Children he says  "As they were a warlike People and therefore in Danger of de∣generating into a savage Ferocity of Manners they em∣ployed Music as the best Means of softening their Tem∣pers into a milder Character and this because Music of all the Pleasures of Sense has the least Tendency to corrupt the Soul  L'Esprit des Loix  l iv c  "  And so far indeed is true that the ancient Greeks did consider this as one of the salutary Effects arising from the Application of Music  PLATO  de Rep  l iii  But we now find that the Matter lay much deeper That Music in its ancient Sense implied not only  Melody  but  Verse  or  Song  That it was the  established Vehicle  of all the leading Principles of their  Religion Morals  and  Polity  and therefore was the natural and most important Instru∣ment or Means in the Education of their Children  The learned DACIER falls into the same Error with Re∣spect to the wonderful Efficacy of  Music  in the  Education  of the  Arcadians  and the fatal Want of it among the In∣habitants  habitants of CYNAETHE as the fact is recorded by POLY∣BIUS and ATHENAEUS  "If says the Critic PO∣LYBIUS speaks thus of  Music  and if he accuseth EPHORUS of having advanced a thing unworthy of him in saying that this Art was invented to deceive Mankind what may we not say of  Tragedy  of which  Music  is but a  small Ornament  and which as far surpasseth  Music  as  Speech  is beyond inarticulate and  unmeaning Sounds  DACIER  Poët d' Aristote Preface  "  In this Passage the learned Writer evidently supposeth that the ancient  Music  which wrought such Wonders in the Education of the  Arcadians  was no more than mere  Melody  or  unmeaning Sound  But the Account which both PO∣LYBIUS and ATHENAEUS give of the musical Education of the  Arcadians  confirms all that hath been here advanced and proves that it consisted in the Application of the united Powers of  Dance Melody  and  Song  The most learned VOSSIUS proceeds on the same Mistake in his first Book  De Natura Artium  And continues under the Influence of this fundamental Error through his whole Dissertation on  Music  As it may seem unaccount∣able how so capital a Mistake should creep into the Writings of these great Authors let me here observe as an Apology for them all that ARISTOTLE and some suc∣ceeding Writers speak of  Music  as an Art  distinct  from  Poetry  Poët passim  It was therefore natural enough for these Writers to draw their Ideas of ancient Music from the great MasterCritic of GREECE How it came to pass that ARISTOTLE should speak of these Arts as  two  which the elder Writers considered as  one  will clearly appear be∣low  Art  where we shall see that in the Time of ARIS∣TOTLE a Separation of the  Melody  and  Song  had taken place that the first retained the Name of  Music  and the second assumed that of  Poetry  "MUSIC in its inlarged Sense acquired a  great  and  general Power  over the Minds and Actions of the ancient  Greeks  " It is presumed that we have now gained an Ascent from whence this Truth will appear evident and indisputable though it hath long been regarded by many as an incredible ParadoxHow or whence such an universal Passion for Music should have arisen in GREECE or after it had arisen how it gained such a general Esta∣blishment in the important Article of Education or after it was thus established how it could work such mighty Effects upon the Mind supposing it to consist only in mere Melodyare Questions which wise Men have asked and Bigots to Antiquity have weakly answered For the common Reply hath been that their  Music  meaning their  Melody  was of a kind so much superior to ours that all its wonderful Effects followed from its more exalted NatureOn the contrary it appears that as to its par∣ticular Construction we are ignorant of it That we have no precise or practicable Idea of their  Genera  their  Modes  nor the  Make  nor  Power  of their  Instruments  But that by collateral Arguments we can prove that their  Melody  was something altogether  simple  and  inartificial  such as States∣men Warriours and Bards occupied in other Pursuits could compose and such as high and low Children and Men busied in other concerns of Life could learn and practise That hence we are led to believe that what∣ever  ever Effects arose from the mere  Melody  arose from its  Rythm  or  Measure  heightened by early  Association  and continued  Habit  by which it became a kind of natural  Language  of the Passions It appears farther that  Melody  formed but a  Part  of the ancient  Music  and that its most important and essential Branch was that of  Verse  or  Song  But for a clear and full View of the Origin and Union of their  Melody  and  Song  it was necessary to go back and be∣gin our Inquiries at the early Period of savage Life in which all the Seeds and Principles of civilized Society ap∣pear in their native and uncultivated State This Method of Investigation hath opened to us an involved and clouded Subject Hence it appears that  Melody Dance  and  Song  naturally arose in  Union  that  Measure Rythm  and  Num∣bers  were the certain Consequence That in the earliest Times of GREECE the Characters of  Legislator  and  Bard  did often and naturally  coalesce  That hence their earliest Histories Laws and Oracles were of course written in Verse that their religious Rites were naturally and with∣out positive Appointment performed or accompanied by Melody Dance and Song That through the several im∣proving Periods of Time their Songs were more and more of a true legislative Cast that they included all the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes and that in these were contained the leading Principles of their Religion Morals and Polity That  Music  in this its inlarged Sense bore an essential and principal Part in the Education of their Children being the pleasing and powerful Vehicle by which all the important Precepts of Life were instilled into their tender MindsThus naturally  Music  arose and was  powerfully established  in ancient GREECE And from this  View of its Nature and establishment its  general Influence  must unavoidably follow  "For through the Force of early and continued Habit together with the irresistible Contagion of public Example maintained by the gene∣ral Practice of the whole Community who had received the same Impressions in their infant State and while every thing pleasing great and important was conveyed through this Medium such strong Associations did strike themselves into the Tribes of GREECE as natu∣rally produced the most lasting Effects and such as no future Incidents of Life could easily weaken or efface"  On these principles we may naturally explain some of the recorded Effects of ancient Music which according to the common Interpretation of the Word have been liable to the Derision of modern Critics  We read that such was the Power of ancient Music that when AGAMEMNON went to TROY the designing EGIS∣THUS could not debauch CLITEMNESTRA till he had decoyed away the  Musician  that was retained in the Palace This Account if we understand by  Music  no more than  Melody  hath much the Air of Hyperbole and Fable But if we regard the  Musician  as what indeed he was the Dis∣penser of  religious  and  moral  Principles and that he urged the great Duty of conjugal Fidelity with the united Powers of poetic Eloquence and Song and urged them to one whose Education had made her susceptible of such Im∣pressions the fabulous Appearances dissolve and we see that no other Method could have been devised so effectual for the Preservation of a weak Woman's Virtue  Again we are told that certain young Men heated with Wine had agreed to assault the Doors of a modest  Woman and abuse her as a Prostitute but that an able Musician coming past he sung and played to them in the  Dorian  Mode on which they were struck with Shame and desisted from their Enterprize  This Story is ridiculed in the  Memoirs  of MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS And the Ridicule is founded on an entire Misapprehension or Mis∣representation of the true nature of  ancient  MUSIC  This to modern Comprehension hath still more the Air of Fable But when the Fact is well explained the Ridicule vanisheth with the Mystery For every  different Subject  had a  diffe∣rent Mode  annexed to it This appears at large from PLATO  "You must adapt the Mode to the Subject and Words not these to the Mode or Harmony On these Matters we will farther deliberate with DAMON what Feet or Measures are fittest to express Illiberality Petu∣lance frantic Folly and other Vices and what Measures best express their contrary Virtues  Hence  it is that Rythm and Numbers gain their Power in the musical Edu∣cation and exercise their mighty Influence on the Passions of the Soul  De Repub  l iii  "  Tis plain therefore that when the Historian tells us that the Musician conquered the young Debauchees by an Application of the  Dorian  Mode he means to signify that the Melody was accompanied by a  poetic Exhortation  suited to the Numbers and this could be no other than a Lesson of  Modesty  and  Temperance  which being conveyed by the pleasing Vehicle of Melody and Song addressed to those who by the Tenor of their Education must feel its Force and given by one whose Pro∣fession they had been taught to reverence could hardly fail  of its designed Effects unless their Intemperance had pre∣vented all Attention  There are other recorded Effects of ancient Music of a similar Nature which it is not necessary to produce here because they may all be accounted for on the same Prin∣ciple With Respect to the traditionary Influence of this Art on wild Beasts Stocks and Stones as it came down from the ignorant and fabulous Times so nothing can be justly concluded from it but the Force of Music over the Minds of uninstructed and wondering Barbarians  Thus the boasted Power of the ancient  Greek Music  seems naturally and fully accounted for And in Confirmation of this Solution we may finally appeal to the savage Tribes with whom this Inquiry began For by Means parallel in most other Respects save only in the Article of Legisla∣tion and Letters they animate each other by the early and continued Use of Melody Dance and Song to Valour in Arms to Constancy in Torments and Death  LAFITAU tom iii p tom iv p g  This is found in Fact to be an Education of such mighty In∣fluence that the  WarSong  and  DeathSong  inspire whole Tribes with a Degree of  Fury  and  Indurance  which hath become the Astonishment of all who have  seen  but never  felt  their Power  SECT VI Of the Progressions of Music in ancient Greece  THE Origin Nature and Power of the ancient Greek Music being thus explained let us now proceed to a like Application of the remaining Articles of the fourth  Section in which we shall endeavour to unfold the various  Progressions  of this Art in GREECE and pursue it through its several Advances towards  Perfection  to its final  Cor∣ruption  and  Decay  "The  Dance  was separated from the  Song  and with or without  Melody  became itself a distinct Exercise or Art under the Title of  Gymnastic  for the Sake of increasing their Strength and Agility of Body as the Means of rendering them invincible in War" This was the natural Effect of their warlike Character for the Reason given above  See Sect iv Art  And that this was the real Generation of the  Gymnastic  Art appears evidently from PLATO's Book of  Laws  where having spoken of the three constituent Parts of a compleat  Choir  Melody Dance and Song he proceeds to deduce from these the Origin of the  Gymnastic  Art  "Is not this the leading Principle of the  Gymnastic  Art that every Creature is born with a natural Inclination to leap or bound But Man being endowed with a Sense of  Rythm  or  Numbers  naturally formed his Motions into  Dance Melody  natu∣rally begets  Rythm  and these two  united  form the  Gymnastic  For  That  we call the  Gymnastic  when the  Dance  is so artificially applied as to improve the Powers of the Body  De Leg  l ii  "  That this Art was applied by the an∣cient  Greeks  to the End of public and warlike Service is generally known However if it needs a Proof another Passage of the same Author will sufficiently confirm it  "After these Instructions in  Music  the Parents send their Sons to the Masters of the  Gymnastic  Schools that by  gaining a firm Habit of Body which may second a wellformed Mind they may be able to indure the Toils of  Enterprise  and  War  In Protag  "  We trace the Foundation and Progress of the  Gymnastic  Art no less clearly in LUCIAN's Account  "The  Spar∣tans  having received this Art of Dancing from CAS∣TOR and POLLUX went  dancing  to  Battle  to the Sound of Flutes Their Application to Music did not lessen their Attention to Arms For a Musician sat in the midst of the Assembly and played on the Flute beating Time with his Foot while they regularly followed the Measure in a Variety of warlike Postures  De Saltatione  "  To confirm these Evidences we may add another In∣stance of a warlike  Dance  which approacheth nearest to the Establishment of the  Gymnastic  Exercise of any record∣ed by Antiquity XENOPHON in his "Expedition of CYRUS" describes one of these Dances in the following Manner  "The  Feast  being ended the  Libations  made and the  Hymn  sung two  Thracians  completely armed began to dance to the Sound of the Flute After skir∣mishing for some time with their Swords one of them as wounded fell down on which the  Paphlagonians  set up a loud Cry The Conqueror having stripped his Adversary departed singing his Victory"  Here we see a near Approach to the Forms of the  Gymnastic  Exer∣cise in their most essential Circumstances yet the original Form of the  Dance  remains  Thus the Origin of the  Gymnastic  Arts is clearly un∣folded as being no more than a Part of the savage  SongFeast    Feast  but separated from thence for the Ends of war∣like Service For Want of this Information the learned VOSSIUS among other Authors stiles the  Dance  a Branch of the  Gymnastic  instead of regarding the  Gymnastic  as the Offspring of the  Dance  De Nat Art  l i c    Here we may farther observe that this View of the  Gymnastic  considered as having been originally a Branch of the  Musical  Art clears up a Difficulty with which every other Account of it is encumbered Thus a late Writer says  "The Exercise of  leaping  in the  Pentathlon  was ac∣companied by  Flutes  playing  Pythian  Airs as PAUSA∣NIAS informs us Whence this Custom was derived I cannot say And the Reason assigned for it by that Author which is certainly not the true one may induce us to think that in this Matter the Ancients were as ignorant as we  WEST's  Transl of  PINDAR's  Odes Pref  "  But on the Principle here given the Custom accounts for itself In the first Institution of the  Gymnastic  Arts it appears that  Melody  made a  Part  of them This  Part  had been disused by Course of Time in the  other  Exercises but had been retained in that of  Leaping  in the  Pentathlon  "After a certain Period of Civilization the  complex  Character of  Legislator  and  Bard  did  separate  and were seldom united" This Separation it hath been shewn above would of course follow from decreasing Enthusiasm and the increasing Labours of Government And such was the natural Rise of the  or  Bards  of ancient GREECE Of whose  Profession  and  Art  a late learned Au∣thor  Enquiry into the Life and Writings of  HOMER  hath in many Circumstances though not in all  given a just Idea Of its original Dignity and Importance in the most ancient Times he did not rightly conceive through his Ignorance of its true Rise and original Union with the Legislator's Office He represents them as wan∣dering Musicians only who were  welcome  to the Houses of the  Great  Such indeed they were in the  later  Periods when the Separation had been long formed and their Office become rather an Affair of  Amusement  than  Utility  But as in the earliest Periods the  Legislators  themselves were often  Bards  so when the Separation of Character was first made the known Influence and Importance of their Office could make them no other than  Assistants  to the  Magistrate  in the high Task of governing the People Of this we have a clear Instance in the Commonwealth of SPARTA which maintained all its original Institutions the most pure and unchanged where a dangerous Insur∣rection arose nor could be quelled by the Magistrate till the Bard TERPANDER came and played and sung at their public Place of Congress  SUIDAS  on the Lesbian Song    HESIOD who was himself of this Order hath given us a noble Description of their Office and Dignity Which as it strongly confirms the Genealogy here given I shall translate at large together with his Picture of the  Ma∣gistrate  along with whom the  Bard  appears to cooperate in the public Welfare as the  second  Character in the  Com∣munity  "Therefore Kings Magistrates are watchful that they may do Justice to the injured at the Place of public Congress soothing the Passions of Men by per∣suasive Speech The People reverence him as a God  while he passes through the City  Kings  are from JOVE  Bards  are from the  Muses  and the farshooting APOLLO Happy is He whom the Muses love His Lips flow with sweet and soothing Accents If any hath a keen and inward Grief freshrankling in his Soul the Bard the Muses Minister no sooner sings the Praise of  ancient Heroes  and the  Gods  who inhabit OLYMPUS than he forgets his Sorrows and feels no more his AnguishHail Daughters of JOVE Inspire  Me  with your persuasive Song  HES THEOG  "  It seems probable that the original  Dignity  of the  Bard's  Character was always maintained longer in  Commonwealths  than under despotic or  kingly  Governments For at the Court of ALCINOUS so early as the Age of HOMER's He∣roes it appears from the Picture given of DEMODOCUS to have sunk into a Character of  Dependance  Odyss  The Reason is manifest The  Republican  Form subsists by an united Exertion of the Powers of every Rank Under the  despotic  Rule the Influence of these various Powers is swallowed up in the absolute Will of ONE We shall see the Bard's Character rising again in its dignified State in the early Periods of other barbarous Nations  See below Sect viii    "In the Course of Time and Progress of Polity and Arts a  Separation  of the several  Kinds  of  Song  did arise In the early Periods they lay confused and were mingled in the same Composition as Inclination En∣thusiasm or other Incidents might impel"This Fact is manifest enough from the Catalogue already given of the Writings of the most ancient Bards of GREECE for  by this it appears that they ranged at large through the Fields of Poetry and  Song  without giving any precise or legitimate Form to their Compositions which seem most generally to have been a rapturous Mixture of  Hymn History Fable  and  Mythology  thrown out by the en∣thusiastic Bard in legislative Songs as different Motives or Occasions presented themselves and according to the Exi∣gencies or Capacity of his surrounding Audience  "But repeated Trial and Experiment produced a more artifi∣cial Manner and thus by Degrees the several Kinds of Poem assumed their legitimate Forms"  For the Truth of this we refer to the following Articles  "HYMNS or  Odes  were composed and  sung  by their Composers at their festal Solemnities" This Species of Song hath in the Way of Preheminence and beyond any other gained the Title of  lyric Poetry  Nor can we won∣der at this if we consider that from its Nature it must have arisen first must have been first moulded into Form and must from its peculiar Genius continue united with  Melody  longer and more universally than any other It arose first because it was natural for the savage Mind to throw itself out in sudden Exclamations of Grief or Joy Love Revenge or Anguish before it could find Means or Leisure to recite at large the Occasions of these powerful Feelings It must be first moulded into Form because its Extent is the smallest and its Plan most simple It must continue united with  Melody  longer and more universally than any other Species because the very Essence of its Sub∣ject is that which the other Kinds only catch incidentally I mean the sudden Shocks and Emotions of the Soul which are found to be the powerful Bands of Nature by  which  Melody  and  Song  are most closely bound toge∣ther  PLUTARCH confirms this Reasoning concerning the  Priority  of the  hymnal  Species and says that  "Music was  first  used in religious Ceremonies being employed in the  Praises  of the  Gods  and that  afterwards  it was applied to  other  Subjects  De Musica  "  Accordingly we find that in the several successive Periods ALCAEUS STESICHORUS TYRTAEUS and others composed and sung their  Odes  at the public Festivals The sublime PINDAR was not more celebrated for his mighty Strains than for his powerful Performance of them at the  Olympic Games  Nay so high was his Fame in this Regard that he had a golden Chair appropriated to him in the Temple of DELPHI where he poured forth the Torrent of his Songs which were attend∣ed to and revered as Oracles issuing from the Inspiration of the God  "The  Epic  Poem arose and was sung by its Com∣posers at their festal Solemnities"When the first Fire of Enthusiasm had vented itself in the Rapture of  Hymns  and  Odes  it naturally assumed a more  sedate  Manner and found Time to  relate  at large those Actions which in its first Agitations it could only celebrate by sudden Bursts of Passion and Praise Accordingly we find many of the elder Poets of GREECE mixing the  hymnal  and  enthusiastic  with the  historic  or  narrative  Species The Exploits of BAC∣CHUS the Rape of PROSERPINE the Wars of the TITANS were among their favourite Themes After these came the Authors of the  Herculiad  and  Thesiad  DEMODOCUS  prior to HOMER sung the Ambush of the  Trojan Horse  PHEMIUS sung the Return of the  Greeks  under AGAMEM∣NON The  little Iliad  comprised most of the subsequent Adventures of the  Trojan War  A  Thebaid  was also writ∣ten the Author of which is not certainly known though PAUSANIAS tells us it was by many ascribed to HO∣MER  L ix  As Example Habit and improving Arts and Polity are the necessary Means of Progress in every Art so these Accounts though imperfectly conveyed to us be∣cause the Poems they allude to are lost sufficiently imply that the  Epic  Muse advanced  gradually  towards Perfection till at length she appeared in full Splendor in the Person of her favoured HOMER  HERODOTUS indeed has thrown out a Hint as if the  Iliad  was prior to the oldest of the Poems ascribed to these most ancient Bards  In  EUTERPE  VELLEIUS PATERCULUS af∣firms the same thing in stronger Terms  L i c  And Mr POPE goes into this Opinion  Diss prefixed to his Trans of the  Iliad  It must be confessed the History of these remote Ages is so dark and fabulous that nothing can with Certainty be collected from them But the very Structure of HOMER's Poem carries in itself such an internal Evidence as turns the Scale against the Historian's Conjecture If we consider the Nature of the human Mind we shall be led to believe that the  Epic  Poem must have received a  gradual  Improvement through that long though unknown Tract of Time during which its unpolished Rudiments existed before the Age of HO∣MER The mere Powers of  Fancy  and  Execution  may  indeed arrive at their highest Perfection by the Efforts of a  single Mind  For what belongs to Nature only Nature only can complete and thus our immortal SHAKESPEAR arose But that an  Epic  PLAN so  complex  so  vast  and yet so  perfect  as that of the  Iliad  which requires an uncom∣mon Penetration even to comprehend in all its Variety and Art which the thoughtful the literate the polished VIRGIL attempted to rival and only proved his utter In∣ability by his Attempt which succeeding Poets have made their Model yet none have ever equalled or approached save only the allcomprehending Mind of the sublime MILTONthat such a Plan as This which required the highest Efforts of an improved Understanding opened and strengthened by a Succession of preceding Examples should at once emerge in all the Extent of Art in the midst of rude and unformed Fables sung at Festivals as vague Enthusiasm might inspirethis is an Opinion re∣pugnant to all our Notices concerning the Progress of the Powers of the human Mind We may as rationally sup∣pose that St PAUL's was the first built Temple its  Organ  the first musical Instrument the LAOCOON and his Sons the first Attempt in Statuary the  Transfiguration  the first Essay in Picture as that the  stupendous Iliad  the Wonder of all succeeding Ages was the  first  Attempt in  Epic  Poetry  What the Nature of the Thing so strongly declares ARISTOTLE seems to confirm in his Poetics For he says that  "although we know not the Names either of the Poems or their Authors yet there is Reason to believe that many had been written before HOMER and that his  Margites  brought this Species to its Perfection in  the same Manner as the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  had compleated the Form of the Epic Poem  Poet  c iv  "  We may reasonably conclude therefore that from the Days of LINUS down to those of HOMER there had been a Succession of Writers among whom the Form of the  Epic  Poem had been  gradually  advancing towards Per∣fection till it received its full Completion in the Birth of the  Iliad  That these Epic Songs in their several Periods were sung by their Composers to the surrounding People we have the general Testimony of ancient Writers This Fact is so clear with Respect to the elder Poets of GREECE that it is much questioned whether ever their  Songs  were committed to  Writing  Whether they were any more than the extempore Efforts of a sudden En∣thusiasm kindled by the sympathetic Power of  religious Rites  or  StateFestivals  That HOMER followed the honourable Profession of a  Bard  and sung his own Poems at the public Feasts hath been proved at large by a learned Writer  Life  of HOMER Sect vii viii  HESIOD was of the same Order and seems to have maintained it with truer Dignity  THEOG  Exord  ver c  TERPANDER held the same Employment and sung both his own Poems and those of HOMER  PLUTARCH  de Musica    "From an  Union  of these two Kinds a certain rude Outline of  Tragedy  arose"For when a Bard sung the great or terrible Atchievements of a Heroe or God the surrounding  Audience  fired to Enthusiasm and already prepared by a correspondent Education would naturally  break forth into the Raptures of a  choral Song  This Progression of Poetry is so natural that it is Matter of Astonishment to hear the learned at all Times ascribing the Rise of Tragedy to Causes merely accidental and confining it to the single Adventure of THESPIS and his Route singing the Praises of BACCHUS at a  casual  Vin∣tage Thus DACIER among others affirms roundly that  "The first dramatic Person which THESPIS  invented  was only  designed  to give Respite to the Choir and what he recited was no more than an Appendage to Tragedy  Sur les Poet D' Arist  p  "  In the same Manner the sensible and learned BRUMOY delivers at large the common System with Respect to the Birth and Progress of the  tragic  Species  Theat des Grecs  tom vi p c  All this is in Contradiction to the Workings of Nature and without Proof supposes That to be a  casual Invention  in a  particular  Instance which was indeed the  natural Progress  of Passion expressed by  Melody Dance  and  Song  We have seen that an Union of Nar∣ration and concurrent Shouts of Praise takes Place even in the rude Festivals of the savage Tribes 'Tis altogether repugnant therefore to the Nature of Things to sup∣pose when  Letters  had given Accents to the Rapture of the surrounding Audience and moulded the Ode into Form that this natural Union should not be upheld Though therefore the first Rise and Progress of the tragic Species in GREECE were hid in Darkness through a Want of recording History yet from a Similarity of Causes and Effects which we find among the barbarous Nations of AMERICA we might fairly conclude that it had not a  casual  but a  certain  Rise from  Nature  according to the Principles here given  But ancient History is not silent on this Subject It gives us a Variety of Facts which overturn the common System and tend to confirm what is here advanced PLATO says expresly that  "Tragedy was very ancient in the City of ATHENS and practised there long before the Age of THESPIS  MINOS  "  We are assured on the Au∣thority of other Writers that  "a Report prevailed in GREECE that certain tragic Poets had in ancient Times contended at the Tomb of THESEUS  See VOSSIUS  Poët  l ii c  "  SUIDAS even mentions one EPIGENES by Name a tragic Poet prior to the Age of THESPIS  But a still stronger Evidence presents itself For even the very Substance and Form of one of these rude Out∣lines of savage Tragedy remains in a respectable Author of Antiquity  "In ancient Times saith STRABO there was a Contest of Musicians who sung  Paeans  in Cele∣bration of the God APOLLO This was established by the Inhabitants of DELPHI after the  Chrissaean  War"  The Description of this Contest is not incurious  "The Poem was composed by TIMOSTHENES The Subject was the Victory of APOLLO over the  Serpent  The  first  Part was the  Prelude  to the Battle the  second  was the  Beginning  of the Engagement the  third  the  Battle  it∣self the  fourth  was the  Paean  or  Triumph  on the Vic∣tory the  fifth  was an Imitation of the  Agonies  and  His∣sing  of the  dying Serpent  STRABO l ix  "  Here we have the very Form and Substance of a first rude Essay towards  Tragedy  compounded of  Narration  and  Correspondent Songs  of  Triumph  Nay as a farther Confirmation not only of this parti∣cular Article but of the general Principles on which this Dissertation is built we learn from other Authors that APOLLO himself was the  Founder  of these  Contests  See J SCALIGER  Poët  l i c  that the  God  was the  first  who  sung  his  own Exploit  that He first described his Engagement with the Serpent and that a Part of the Contest consisted in an Imitation of APOLLO who  danced after his Victory  JUL POLL  Onomast  l iv c  In this whole Scene of the  God  of Music  singing dancing  and  praising  his  own Atchievements  we have the genuine Picture of a  savage Chieftain  See above Sect ii    It appears therefore that Tragedy had a much earlier and deeper Foundation in ancient GREECE than the acci∣dental Adventure of THESPIS and his Rout That it arose from  Nature  and an unforced  Union  and  Progression  of  Melody Dance  and  Song  At the same Time it is manifest that THESPIS added  something  to the rude and savage Form of Tragedy as it existed in  his  Age 'Tis probable that He was the  first Declaimer  or  Interlocutor  to  his own Choir  that he first established the  Profession  of a  Player  in ATTICA and first transported his  Company  from one Village to another whereas before his Time the Exhibitions of the rude tragic Scene had been fixed and merely  incidental  HOR  Ep ad  PISDIOG LAERT SOLON  This Institution of an itinerant Company must necessarily in∣crease  the general Attention of ATTICA to these rude tra∣gic Scenes And hence the Opinion seems first to have arisen that THESPIS was the  Inventor  of this Species  The most learned BENTLEY fell into the common System with Regard to the Rise of Tragedy Attempting to prove that THESPIS was its  Inventor  Thus for Want of the true  Data  and from an Unac∣quaintance with Man in his savage State this great Critic hath thrown out a Chain of Errors While if he had been led up to the true Foun∣tains of Information he would probably have caught the various Pro∣gressions of Poetry at a Glance  Mr BOYLE in his Examination of BENTLEY's Dissertation seems once or twice to get out of the common Track of Criticism on his Subject Yet for Want of knowing the true Origin of Tragedy as founded in hu∣man Nature he throws little or no Light upon the Question He insists that Tragedy is more ancient than THESPIS on the Authority of PLATO and LAERTIUS But he falls again into the vulgar Track in affirming that till the Time of THESPIS the  Episode  had no Existence but only the  Choir  In Confutation of which Opinion we have now shewn that the full Form of savage Tragedy had appeared many Ages before in the first Institution of the  Pythian Games    "In Process of Time this barbarous Scene im∣proved into a more perfect Form Instead of  relating  they  represented  by an  assumed Character  and by  Action  and  Song  those great or terrible Atchievements which their Heroes had performed" How soon the savage Tribes fall into this Kind of dramatic Representation we have already seen  Above Sect ii  How natural such a Progression of Art must be to the human Mind will appear by reflecting that dramatic  Action  is but another Mode of  Narration  and that even the  Narration  of the savage Tribes is found to have such a Mixture of  Action  in it as strongly tends to produce the dramatic Imitation  Ibid  Time therefore and repeated Efforts must naturally advance the  narrative  Episode  into  personal Representation  And thus we are arrived at the Form which Tragedy wore when the in∣ventive Genius of ESCHYLUS advanced the Art one Step higher and by adding a  second Person  to the Drama brought in the Use of  Dialogue  Here for the Sake of Truth we must again depart from the general Body of Critics most of whom from ARIS∣TOTLE down to our own Times unite in supposing rhat ESCHYLUS was only a casual Imitator of HOMER and drew the Idea of all his Tragedies from the ILIAD A noble Critic of our own Country hath affirmed this in the fewest and strongest Terms and says that  "There was no more left for Tragedy to do after him HOMER than to erect a Stage and draw his Dialogues and Characters into Scenes  Characteristic  vol i p  "  It may be deemed presumptuous perhaps to question a Point wherein the great MasterCritic of GREECE hath himself decided But let us remember that the Days are now past when it was held a Point of Honour to  swear  to the  Opinions  of a  Master  ARISTOTLE is often ad∣mirable generally judicious yet sometimes perhaps mis∣taken even in his Judgment of Men and Things relative to his own Country He was more especially capable of being misled by the common Opinion in this Point in which neither He nor any of his Countrymen could be sufficiently informed for Want of a competent Knowledge of the Genius and Character of savage Manners  That ESCHYLUS was not a mere Imitator of HOMER that he was a great and original Poet who exalted his Art one Degree beyond his Predecessors in his own Country seems  a Point which collateral Arguments strongly confirm We are informed in general Terms that there were no less than fifteen tragic Poets who writ before him And the Probability is much stronger that he should draw his Improvement from the  scenic  Representations already established in which he found one dramatic Person and an accompanying  Choir  which in all Probability stood in the Place of a second Person and often sustained a Kind of Dialogue with the principal Interlocutor  This Opinion receives a strong Confirmation from the following Circumstance that in the  Greek Tragedies  which have come down to us whenever there is a  single Interlocutor  on the Stage the  Choir  frequently maintains a  Dialogue  with him  than that he should have Recourse to HOMER's Poems in which no dramatic Representation was to be found  To this Argument may be added another drawn from the Style and Manner of ESCHYLUS so different from that of HOMER For HOMER is equal large flowing and harmonious ESCHYLUS is uneven concise abrupt and rugged The one leads you through the grand but gentle Declivities of Hill and Dale the other carries you over a continued Chain of Rocks and Precipices Now if HOMER had been the Model of ESCHYLUS some  Similarity  of  Manner  would probably have ensued  A third and still stronger Proof arises from the essential Difference of their Subjects both in Extent and Nature In Extent because the one is of  long  the other of short Duration In Nature because HOMER's Poems are chiefly employed in the Exhibition of  Character  and  Manners  those of ESCHYLUS in the Representation of  Terror  and  Distress  Had he been that mere Imitator of HOMER which the Critics have adjudged him and had nothing to  do but to erect a Stage and to draw HOMER's Dialogues into Scenes he would have been content to have taken  his  Subjects from the  Iliad  and according to HORACE's sober Rule have never ventured beyond the Siege of  Troy  RECTIUS ILIACOS c  He would have brought upon the Stage the Anger of ACHILLES the Battle of PARIS and MENELAUS the Part∣ing of HECTOR and ANDROMACHE the Feats of DIO∣MEDE and would have contrasted the  strength  of AJAX with the  Cunning  of ULYSSES Nothing of all this ap∣pears On the contrary his  Subjects  and  Manner  are equal∣ly  his own  and  both  of a Genius opposite to those of HOMER  What PLUTARCH says of HOMER though brought for the contrary Purpose tends to confirm all that is here ad∣vanced  "Even Tragedy took its Rise from HOMER For his Poems comprehend every thing that is  sublime  and  great  In Vita  HOMERI  "  This you will say is a very insufficient Reason because the Critic forgets the  pathetic  and the  terrible  which were the essential Constituents of the Greek Tragedy But mark the Sequel which is still more ex∣traordinary  "Neither do they HOMER's Poems con∣tain Descriptions of those  atrocious Actions  which have been feigned by the later Tragedians such as  Incest  and the  Murder  of  Parents  or  Children  Nay whenever he happens to touch on any thing of this Kind he always  softens  and throws it  into Shades  Ibid  "  Thus while PLUTARCH is labouring to prove that the  Greek  Tragedy was  drawn  from HOMER he proves that HOMER's Poems were  destitute  of that which was of the  Essence  of the  Greek  Tragedy  SCALIGER is a venerable exception to the general Body of the Critics on this Subject and seems to have viewed the Question in its true Light  "In the  Iliad  saith he there is nothing like the  Progression  of a  Tragedy  if you take the  whole  together For from Beginning to End there is a  perpetual  Succession of  Deaths  He begins with a Pestilence which destroys more Men than the whole War  Poët  l i c  "  The Critic then goes on to prove by a large Enumeration of Circumstances the  Iliad  hath very few of the essential Characteristics of  Tragedy  We may fairly conclude then that the Improvement which Tragedy received from ESCHYLUS was not  casual  but the Result of a  natural Progression  That he drew not from HOMER's Poems as a mere Imitator but exalted his Art one Step higher from the Force of true  Genius  in the  tragic  Species  What followed is well known SOPHOCLES added a  third  Person to the Drama And by this Improvement is said by the Critics to have  compleated  the Form of Tragedy The Truth of their Decision I much doubt but this Disquisition lies beyond the Limits of our present En∣quiry  "As the Choir was established by Nature and Custom and animated their Solemnities by  Dance  as well as  Song  the Melody Dance and Song did of Course regulate each other and the Ode or Song natu∣rally fell into  Stanzas  of some  particular  Kind" This arose by an easy Progression from the savage State where  "they who dance go round in a circular Movement and after a short Interval being a second  See Sect ii  "  The  Greeks  not only fell into this Manner but improved upon it They went round first to the one Hand then to the other and then paused The Learned have found out mystical Reasons for these circular Movements referring them to the Motion of the Planets  ATHENAEUS  Deip  l i  Much Labour cannot be necessary for the Confutation of these Refinements as the Practice arose so evidently from the Dictates of Nature It was a natural and sensible Improvement for the plain Reason of  preventing Giddiness  which ariseth from running round in the same Circle  Let us attend therefore to its Consequences As each  Dance  or  Return  was marked by its peculiar  Measure  this of Course fixed both the  Melody  and poetic  Numbers  of the accompanying Song And as they likewise sung during the  Interval  of Rest we see that from this easy Improve∣ment on the savage SongFeast the  Strophe Antistrophe  and  Epode  naturally arose  "Another Consequence of the established  Choir  was a strict and unvaried Adherence to the  Unities  of  Place  and  Time  " This Effect is so manifest as to need little Illustration A numerous  Choir  maintaining their Station through the whole Performance gave so forcible a Conviction to the Senses of the  Sameness  of  Place  and the  Shortness  of  Time  that any Deviation from this ap∣parent Unity must have shocked the Imagination with an Improbability too gross to be indured Notwithstanding all the Panegyrics of the Critics therefore upon the Greek Tragedians on Account of these  Unities  it is evident  they arose in the rudest Periods and were continued through the more polished Ages on the same Principle of untaught Nature and established Custom  "Not only the Part of the tragic  Choir  but the  Episode  or  interlocutory  Part was also  Sung  " The most sensible of the Critics have ever regarded this as a Circumstance equally unnatural and unaccountable Thus DACIER speaks  "It must be owned that we cannot well comprehend how Music  Melody  could ever be considered as in any Respect making a Part of Tragedy For if there be any thing in the World that is at Variance with  tragic Action  it is  Song  Sur  ARISTOTE p c  "  The learned Critic is so shocked with this supposed Union in Appearance so unnatural that upon the whole he questions its Existence and is of Opinion that when ARISTOTLE speaks of  Music  as being annexed to  Tragedy  he speaks of the  Choir  only  Ibid  This however is contrary to the united Voice of Antiquity which universally admits the Fact though its Origin was never accounted for But how naturally this union took Place in ancient Tragedy we now clearly discover by investigating the Rise and Pro∣gress of this Poem from the savage State For it appears that the  Epic  and  Ode  were both sung from the earliest Periods and therefore when they became  united  and by that Union formed the tragic Species they of Course maintained the same Appendage of  Melody  which Nature and Custom had already given them  The  Abbé du  Bos endeavours to prove indeed that the  Song  which was employed in the  Episode  of ancient Tra∣gedy  was no more than a Kind of  regulated  or  measured Declamation  Reflec Crit  Part iii c c  But his Inquiries are partial for he goes no higher than to the Practice of the  Romans  And it is probable from several Circumstances that in the late Period when the  Romans  borrowed their Music from the  Greeks  the Tragic  Song  had been brought down from a  measured Melody  to a kind of  regulated Declamation  Thus TULLY mentions the  Cantus Subobscurus  and again saith  "Delicatiores sunt falsae Voculae quam certae et severae"  But though these with several other Argu∣ments alledged by the  Abbé  seem to imply that the tragic  Song  was little more than a measured Recitation yet this will by no means prove that a more full and direct Song had not been used in Tragedy thro' the more early Periods In the Course of this Dissertation the Practice of  singing  Tragedy hath been traced from its first Rise in savage Manners which at once destroys the  Improbability  of the Custom and proves that it was even founded in Nature a Circumstance of which the  Abbé  had not the least Sus∣picion This Foundation being laid we cannot but listen attentively to what the early Writers of GREECE tell us on this Subject Now these unite in informing us that the  Episode  of Tragedy was  Sung  and even name the  Modes  of Music which were appropriated to the  Episode  in Contradistinction to the  Choir  ARISTOT  Prob    That the  Song  should approach nearer by Degrees to mere Declamation will appear probable when we consider the gradual Sepa∣rations which successively took Place in the musical Art during the successive Periods of GREECE and ROME  To mention only one Instance here similar to what we now treat of ARISTOTLE informs us that in  His  Time the  Rhapsodists  whose Profession it was to  sing  the Poems of HOMER and HESIOD were beginning to make In∣roads into the ancient Practice and now  recited  those  Poems  which in  former Times  had been always  sung  Poët  c    The  Abbé  falls into an Error with Respect to the  Dance  parallel to that which he adopts with Regard to the  Melody  of the Ancients As he insists that their  tragic Melody  was only a  measured Recitation  so he affirms that their  tragic Dance  was no more than  Action  Reflec  Part iii c  It is true that in the later Periods of  Rome  when the musical Sepa∣rations had taken Place this was the general Meaning of the Word  Saltatio  And hence as in his Opinion of the tragic Song his Mistake arose For it is evident from the concurrent Testimony of the elder  Greek  Writers that the  tragic Dance  was performed in the very Manner here de∣scribed We now see that this  Dance  no less than the  tragic Song  arose from untaught Nature and that it was the genuine Parent of the  Strophe Antistrophe  and  Epode  "As the  Greek  Nation was of a  fierce  and  warlike  Character their tragic Representations rowled chiefly on Subjects of  Distress  and  Terror  "On this Topic I doubt whether ARISTOTLE hath not mistaken an  Effect  for a  Cause  For he says that  "Tragedy by means of  Pity  and  Terror  purgeth in us  Those  and other such like  Passions  Poët  c  "  MARCUS AURELIUS  L xi Art  MILTON  Preface to  SAMSON AGONISTES  DACIER  Poët d' Arist  and BRUMOY  Theat des Grecs  tom i p  all understand him as  meaning that Tragedy was formed  with this View  It is not the Writer's Design to remark on this great Critic far∣ther than what relates to his main Subject Therefore it will suffice to say that if ARISTOTLE meant to assign this  moral End  as the  Cause  why Tragedy assumed this Form in ancient GREECE and adopted Subjects of  Distress  and  Terror  He seems to have taken That for a  Cause  which was a  natural Effect  of the ruling  Manners  of the  Greek  Republics The Reasons which support the general Truth already given in the correspondent Article will hold their Force when applied here For thus the  Greeks  animat∣ed each other to  Victory  and  Revenge  by a Representation of what their Friends had  done  and  suffered  These Sub∣jects would likewise be most accommodated to the natural Taste of the poetic Chiefs of such a People whose  At∣chievements  produced and abounded with Events of  Dis∣tress  and  Terror  Such then was the natural Origin and Adoption of these Subjects in the  Greek Tragedy  But after they were established on this Foundation 'tis proba∣ble that the Statesmen encouraged and applied them to the  Ends  of Policy For as the leading View of a fierce and warlike People must be to  destroy Pity  and  Fear  so This would most effectually be done by making themselves familiar with distressful and terrible Repre∣sentations Under these Restrictions the Opinion of ARISTOTLE may have a Foundation in Nature Farther than this and as applied to any People whose End is not  War  and  Conquest  it carries the Appearance of a refined Idea which hath no Foundation in Nature The grand scenic Representations of the  Peruvians  and  Chinese  as  will appear below  Sect viii  whose leading Object was  Peace  are known to be of a quite contrary Nature formed on their gentler Manners and such as would have been alto∣gether incompatible with the warlike Character and in∣sipid to the Taste of the Tribes of ancient GREECE  "Their Tragedy being designed as a visible Repre∣sentation of their ancient Gods and Heroes they in∣vented a Method of strengthening the Voice and ag∣grandizing the Visage and Person as the Means of com∣pleating the Resemblance" It is generally known that the old  Grecian Gods  were supposed to be of a Stature  ex∣ceeding  that of  ordinary  Men And the true Reason of that Opinion was because in the early Ages they like every other barbarous People  See LAFITAU and other Travellers  selected the  tallest  and  strongest  Men for their  Chiefs  Which Chiefs in Course of Time became their  Gods  Hence the  Buskin  and  Masque  had their natural Birth For the first  hightened  the  Stature  as the second  inlarged  the  Visage  and  strengthened  the  Voice  of the dramatic Actor And although the common Accounts mention nothing of the  Inlargement  of the  Body  yet we learn from LUCIAN that the  Breast Back  and all the  Limbs  were  amplified  in Proportion to the  Visage  and  Stature  De Saltatione  Manifestly as the Means of compleating the Resemblance of their Gods and Heroes  By thus tracing the  Buskin  and  Masque  to their true Origin we shall now be able to give a Reason for a Fact which hath hitherto been regarded as merely the Effect of Whim and Caprice THESPIS and his  Com∣pany  bedaubed their Faces with the  Lees  of  Wine  Whence arose this Practice seemingly so wild THESPIS and  his  Company  were the Votaries of BACCHUS and exhibited his Exploits and sung his Praises to their Countrymen Their use of the  Lees  of  Wine  therefore was intended as the Means of compleating the  Resemblance  of their  drunken God  and his  Crew  "As their  tragic Poets  were  Singers  so they were  Actors  and generally performed some capital Part in their own Pieces for the Stage" This Fact hath gene∣rally been held extraordinary and unaccountable And hath been resolved it seems by some Talkers on this Sub∣ject into the  Want  of  Actors  in the  early  Periods We now clearly discover a contrary Cause The Practice took Place when the  highest  Characters were  proud  to signalize themselves as  Actors  When Legislators and Bards as∣sumed the  Lyrist's  and  Actor's  Character as the Means of civilizing their surrounding Tribe Therefore till some extraordinary Change in Manners and Principles should ensue the original Union established by Nature and Custom was of course maintained in GREECE SOPHOCLES was the first on Record who quitted this honourable Employ And He only because his Voice was unequal to the Vast∣ness of the  Athenian  Stage That he quitted it on this Principle alone appears from his Conduct on other Oc∣casions For he not only  Sung  his  own  Verses but likewise  led  the  Dance  at a public Triumph  ATHEN  Deipn  l i    "MUSICAL  Contests  were admitted as public Ex∣ercises in the  Grecian  States" For the Truth of This we have the concurrent Evidence of many ancient Wri∣ters That Union of  Gymnastic  and  musical  Exercises which took Place in the early Periods of the  Greek  Repub∣lics  hath by some Writers been regarded as  unnatural  by all as  accidental  Thus a learned Author says  "To these  Gymnastic  Exercises were added others of a quite  different Nature  POTTER  Arch Graec  "  But by following this Establish∣ment up to its first Principles we have now found that in Fact the  Gymnastic  Exercises were originally a  Part  of the  musical  See above Art  being no more than the improved  Dance  which was a Branch of ancient  Music  In Process of Time as hath been proved the  Dance  or  Gymnastic  Art was gene∣rally separated from the  Melody  and  Song  But it is re∣markable that in all their public Games or Contests from the earliest to the latest Periods these several Branches of Music either separate or in Union composed the essential Parts of their public Exhibitions  The learned STRABO hath left us the most particular Account of the Rise and Progress of the Pythian Games which entirely coincides with the Principles here given  Ibid    "In ancient Times there was a Contest of Musicians who sung Paeans in Celebration of the God APOLLO This was established at DELPHI after the  Crissaean  War"  So far we see the musical Contest maintained its original Savage Form without any Separation of the Dance  "Afterwards the  Amphictyons  under EURY∣LOCHUS instituted the  equestrian  and  gymnastic  Contest appointing a Crown as the Conqueror's Reward And these Games were called the  Pythian  STRABO ib  "  Here we see in a later Period the Establishment assumed its political Form a Separation ensued the  Dance  was heightened into the  Gymnastic  Art for the Reasons assigned above  We have already seen the Form of this musical Contest as described by STRABO  Art  We have observed that other ancient Authors with great Shew of Probability deduce its Origin from APOLLO himself  Ibid  SCALIGER speaking of the Rise of these  Pythian  Games makes no Doubt of their having been instituted by APOLLO  Poet  l i c  But not knowing the true Origin of the  Gymnastic  Art as having originally made a Part of the  musical  and supposing according to the common System that these Games were established as an  imitative Memorial  of the  particular Action  performed he adds with great Candour  "I won∣der considering that he killed the  Python  with an  Arrow  that he did not institute a  Contention  of  Archers  rather than  Musicians  Ibid  "  This Doubt so candidly expressed throws new Light upon the Question and is a collateral Circumstance of Proof that these Games had their Origin in the savage  SongFeast  which in aftertimes branched out into the  Gymnastic  Arts  So much concerning the Rise and Progress of the  Py∣thian  Games which sufficiently clears our Subject As to the Origin and Progress of the Olympic Games it is much hid in the Darkness of distant Ages They are generally ascribed to the  Idaean  HERCULES who is said to have given them the Name of  Olympic  But if we attend to Arguments of Probability arising from the Analogy of Names we shall rather be led to attribute their In∣stitution to the  Olympian  JUPITER especially as Tra∣dition supports this Conjecture at least as strongly as the other For PAUSANIAS informs us that  "there are  who say that JUPITER contended for Empire with SATURN in this very Place Others affirm that having vanquished the  Titans  He JUPITER instituted these Games in which others too are said to have been Con∣querors that APOLLO vanquished MERCURY in the  Race  and overcame MARS at  boxing  PAUSANIAS l v  "  All this agrees so entirely with the Character and Contentions of savage Chieftains as to create a strong Probability of the Truth of the Tradition This we know however that Musical Contests made an essential Part of these magnifi∣cent Exhibitions and that PINDAR sung his Odes and was often  crowned  as  Victor  in these public Contests  The  Isthmian  and  Nemean  Games having been instituted in later Periods when a Separation of the Dance had been already made and consequently the  Gymnastic  Arts already established we cannot properly draw any Conclusions from These relative to the present Question  The  tragic Contests  which followed on the Improve∣ment of that Species of Poetry are too well known to need any particular Delineation Let it suffice that we have traced them up to their first rude Form and Origin in the musical Contest at DELPHI as described by STRA∣BO  See above Art  They were reestablished in their more improved State by CIMON when that General brought the Remains of THESEUS to ATHENS The three great tragic Bards ESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES all  contended  and were  crowned  by turns  This general Establishment of musical Contests which hath been so often held trifling and unaccountable appears  now to have been founded in true Policy and Wisdom  "For as the leading Articles of their Religion Morals and Polity made a Part of their public Songs so pub∣lic Contests of this Kind were justly regarded as the surest Means of keeping up an Emulation of a most use∣ful Nature and of strengthening the State by inforcing the fundamental Principles of Society in the most agree∣able most striking and most effectual Manner"  "The Profession of  Bard  or  Musician  was held as very  honourable  and of high Esteem" We have seen the Foundation of This in the fifteenth Article of the present Section For he was vested with a Kind of public Character and if not an original Legislator was at least a subordinate and useful Servant of the State And as the Utility of his Profession was such as arose from  Genius  personal Respect and Honour was the natural Consequence in a  well ordered Republic  The Facts which support this Truth with regard to ancient GREECE are commonly known from the  Crowns Triumphs  and other Marks of public and appointed Regard bestowed on the  Victors  in the musical Contests  "ODES and  Hymns  made a Part of their domestic En∣tertainment and the Chiefs were proud to signalize them∣selves by their Skill in  Melody  and  Song  "This is gene∣rally known and needs no particular Proof It is introduc∣ed here that it may be accounted for Because it hath been held a Practice unworthy the Character of  Legislators  and  Heroes  to be ambitious of  singing  and  playing  on the Lyre But if we examine the Nature of the ancient Songs of GREECE we shall find that the Performance of them was worthy of the highest Characters It was usual for all  who were at their Entertainments first to sing together the Praises of the Gods  PLUT  Symp  l i q i ATHEN  Deip  l xv  Then they sung successively one by one holding a Branch of  Myrtle  in their Hand which was sent round the Table  PLUT ib  In later Times when the  Lyre  came more into Use  this  Instrument was sent round instead of the  Myrtle  and in this Period it was that their Songs assumed the Name of  Scolia  PLUT ib ATHEN ib    The Songs were chiefly of the three great Classes  religious political  and  moral  Of the first Class ATHE∣NAEUS hath preserved no less than five One to PALLAS one to CERES one to APOLLO one to PAN and one to all the tutelary Gods of ATHENS  ATHEN ib    Of the second Class the  political  in which their  Heroes  were celebrated though not advanced to the Rank of  Gods  the same Author hath given us several in which AJAX TELAMON HARMODIUS the  Heroes  who fell at LEIPSY∣DRION ADMETUS the  Olympic  Victors and others were celebrated at their private Entertainments  ATHEN ib    Of the third or  moral  Class ATHENAEUS hath likewise transmitted to us a Collection Of this Kind we find one upon the  Vanity  and  Mischiefs  of  Riches  one upon  Pru∣dence  one upon the comparative Excellence of the  Goods  of Life one upon  Friendship  one upon the  Choice  of  Friends  one upon  false Friends  and a fine one of ARIS∣TOTLE on the  Force of Virtue  which may be said in some Measure to comprehend all the three Kinds  religious political  and  Moral  ATHEN ib  Such being the Nature of the old  Grecian Songs  and the whole Nation having been prepared to perform and listen to them with Reverence by a correspondent Education no Wonder that the highest Characters in the Commonwealth bore a Part in their Performance at private Entertainments  "For their Songs being enriched with the great and im∣portant Subjects relative to their public State and being the  established Vehicle  of  Religion Morals  and  Polity  nothing could be more suitable to a high Station in the Commonwealth than a Proficiency in this  sublime  and  legislative Art  "  "When  Music  had attained to this State of relative  Perfection  it was esteemed a  necessary Accomptishment  And an Ignorance in this Art was regarded as a capital Defect" Of this we have an Instance even in THE∣MISTOCLES himself who was upbraided with his Igno∣rance in Music  CICERO  Tusc  l i  The whole Country of  Cynaethe  laboured under a parallel Reproach  ATHENAEUS POLYBIUS  And all the enormous  Crimes  committed there were attributed by the neighbouring States to the  Neglect  of  Music  What Wonder For according to the Delineation here given of the ancient Greek Music their Ignorance in this noble Art implied a general Deficiency in the three great Articles of a social Education  Religion Morals  and  Polity  "The Genius of their Music varied along with their Manners" Of this Truth we have had abundant Proofs in the Course of this Dissertation where we have seen Music in its ancient and inlarged Sense emerge from the Rudeness of barbarous Life and improve through  the successive Periods of improving Manners We shall soon see a parallel Decline of this noble Art arising from an equivalent Cause For Manners being the leading and  "most essential Quality of Man All his other Tastes and Acquirements naturally correspond with These and accommodate themselves to his Manners as to their original Cause"  "As every Change of Manners influenced their Music so by a reciprocal Action every considerable Change of Music influenced their Manners" The Facts which prove this will be given in the thirty fourth Ar∣ticle In the mean Time the Reason is evident For not only the Passion for  Novelty  and  Change  was immediately dangerous to the  Stability  of  small Republics  but still farther as  Music  was the established  Vehicle  of all the great Principles of  Education  a Change in  Music  inevitably brought on a Change in  These  "There was a provident Community of Principles uncommonly severe which fixed the Subjects and Move∣ments of Song and Dance by Law" This provident Community was that of SPARTA The Practice was not peculiar to this wise though barbarous Commonwealth It was borrowed from CRETE and came originally from EGYPT where the same provident Institution had taken Place in earlier AgesIn that great Fountain of ancient Polity not only the Art of  Music  in its inlarged Sense but even that of  Painting  was fixed and made unalterable by Law  PLATO  de Legibus  l ii  PLATO who informs us of This gives a par∣ticular Detail of the musical Establishment which sets the Principle in a clear Light and corroborates what is here  advanced  "All their Songs and Dances are consecrated to the Gods It is ordained what Sacrifices shall be offered to each Deity and what  Songs  and  Choirs  shall be appointed to each Sacrifice But if any Person makes use of  Hymns  or  Choirs  in the Worship of the Gods other than what is appointed by  Law  the Priests and Magistrates expel him the Community  De Leg  l vii  "Hence saith PLATO in another Place "their  Music  is found to have continued  uncorrupted  and the  same  for thousands of Years  Ibid l ii  "  A Stroke of Polity fatal indeed to  Art  but excellent with Respect to the Stability and Duration of a State This uncommon Effort of  Egyptian  Legislation the  Spartan  Lawgiver adopted from CRETE and by this severe Establishment is said  "three Times to have saved the State"  Innovations were attempted by three diffe∣rent Musicians TERPANDER TIMOTHEUS and PHRYN∣NIS  ATHEN  Deip  l xiv  And as the very Sentence of the  Spartan  Senate against one of these Incroachers on the severe Simplicity of the Commonwealth is yet preserved it may not be dis∣agreeable to the Reader to present him with this curious Remnant of Antiquity  "Whereas TIMOTHEUS the  Milesian  coming into our City and despising the ancient Music rejecting also that Melody which ariseth from seven Strings and setting off his Music by a Multiplicity of Strings and a new Species of Melody corrupts the Ears of our Youth and instead of That which is legiti∣mate and pure corrupting the  Enharmonic  by new various and  Chromatic  Sounds and being called to the  Eleusinian  Mysteries did divulge the Secrets of that Insti∣tution  It seemed good to the  Senate  and  Rhetors  that TIMOTHEUS should be called to Account for these Pro∣ceedings that he should be compelled to cut off the four superfluous Strings from his Lyre leaving the seven ancient Tones and that he be banished to a Distance from the City that hence forward none may dare to introduce any new and dangerous Custom into SPARTA lest the Honour of our musical Contests should be de∣filed  ARATI PHAENOMENA  Ed Oxon  at the End of which this Edict is preserved  "  In this Edict we see the jealous Spirit of a Republic which could only subsist by a rigorous Simplicity of Man∣ners and an unalterable Obedience to its Laws There hath been much illfounded Ridicule thrown on the  Spartans  for this Decision For if we consider the danger∣ous Effects of mere  Innovation  in  small Republics  and the close Connexion between the  Melody  and the  Subject  in ancient  Music  together with the early and continued Ap∣plication of  These  to the  Education  of their Youth we shall find that in this Instance the  Spartans  only acted a cautious and consistent Part Their Principle was to admit  no Change  in  Manners  and therefore  no Change  in  Music  The designed Innovation of TIMOTHEUS therefore would have destroyed the first leading Principle the very Genius of their Republic and consequently must have been fatal to the Republic itself  "In the Commonwealths which were of more li∣bertine and relaxed Principles and particularly in that of ATHENS the Corruption of Manners brought on the Corruption of Music and this Corruption of Music  still farther corrupted Manners the Musicians Bards or Poets being the immediate Instruments of the Cor∣ruption" This mutual Influence of Manners and Mu∣sic on each other hath been already explained in two pre∣ceding Articles  Art  And the Truth of these Reasonings is confirmed by Facts which PLATO gives us at large in the following most remarkable Passage  "The People of ATHENS did not in former Times controul the Laws but willingly obeyed them I mean those Laws which were made concerning Music For Music was then precisely distinguished into its several Kinds One was appropriated to the Supplication and Praises of the Gods These were called  Hymns  An∣other Species was the lamenting or pathetic A third was the  Paean  or Song of Triumph A fourth was the  Dithyrambic  and a fifth consisted in singing ancient  Laws  or  Proverbs  See Art  In These and other Subjects established by Law it was not allowed to use one Kind of Melody instead of another Each Kind had its par∣ticular Appropriation The Power of deciding on These and of condemning in Case of Disobedience was not committed to the Hisses and foolish Clamours of the Multitude as is now the Practice Neither was the Liberty of intemperate Praise allowed to a noisy Croud This Decision was left to Men distinguished by their Sense and Knowledge and a general Silence was maintained till they had heard the Conclusion of the Work The young Men their Governors and all the People were obedient to the Motions of a Wand While this good Order was maintained the Multitude  willingly obeyed nor dared to decide any thing in a tumultuous Manner But in Course of Time the Poets themselves were accessary to a fatal Change in Music They wanted not Genius but had no Regard to what was just and legitimate running into Extravagance and too much indulging the Vein of Pleasure Hence they confounded all the several Kinds together affirm∣ing that  mere Taste  and  Pleasure  whether it were that of a  good  or a  wicked  Man was the only  Criterion  of  Music  In Consequence of this they composed their  Poems  on the same Principle and thus rendered the  Multitude  so  bold  and  daring  against the  established Music  that they assumed to themselves the sole Right of de∣ciding on it Hence the Theatres began to be in Up∣roar where formerly Silence had reigned And thus the Privilege of  judging  fell from the  Rulers  of the State to the  Dregs  of the People Had this Authority been assumed by the  liberal  Part of the City no great Harm had followed But now from this  corrupt Change  in  Music  a  general Licentiousness  of  Opinion  hath ensuedThe Consequence of this hath been that we no longer are disposed to obey the Magistrate Hence too that other Evil flows that we despise the Authority and Precepts of our Parents and the Advice and Wisdom of Old Age And as we are rising towards the Extreme of this Corruption we now refuse Obedience to the Laws And to fill up the Measure of our Iniquities all  Religion  and mutual  Faith  are  lost  among us  De Legibus  l iii  "  Such is the Picture which the philosophic PLATO hath lest of his Time and Country A Picture too well con∣firmed  by the concurrent Testimony of XENOPHON  See below Sect vii Art  in whose Accounts together with those of PLUTARCH  See ib  we shall soon see a particular Delineation of the Progress of this Evil which PLATO here describes in general Terms  Let us conclude this Article with the Explanation of Subjects which hath not hitherto been clearly treated of for want of a just Idea of the ancient  Greek Music  The learned VOSSIUS thus expresseth himself  "It is a doubtful Point whether we should say that on a Change of Music a Change of Manners ensues or that a Change of Manners produceth a Change in Music The first was DAMON's Opinion which PLATO follows But CICERO leans to the latter System  VOSSIUS  "  On this Passage it is necessary first to observe that both VOSSIUS and CICERO use the Word  Music  in its  modern  Acceptation as implying mere  Melody  No Wonder therefore if they had but an imperfect Comprehension of PLATO's Argu∣ment Secondly On the Principles delivered in this Dis∣sertation it will appear that PLATO was of both these Opinions  "That Manners influenced Music and Music influenced Manners"  In the Passage which VOSSIUS refers to where the Opinion of DAMON is delivered PLATO speaks of a Change in Music as influencing the Manners of a Commonwealth This Change he regards as opening a Door for Confusion and Novelty in an Affair of public Consequence similar to a Neglect of Reverence to old Men Parents or Magistrates or any other ancient and approved Customs that were connected with the public Welfare and in this Respect the Influence of the Greek  Music as now explained on the Manners of Mankind is too evident to need any farther Proof  On the other Hand it is no less evident that PLATO was of Opinion that a Corruption of Manners must cor∣rupt Music He hath shewn us in the Passage given above that the Boldness and Degeneracy of the People of ATHENS first allured the Poets to debase their Art by singing such Poems as were accommodated to their vicious Taste founded on their vicious Manners That as Man∣ners had thus debased Music so this corrupt Music by a natural Reaction still farther corrupted Manners and com∣pleated the Destruction of Religion and Virtue  "In Consequence of these Progressions a gradual and total Separation of the Bard's complex Character ensued The Leader of the State no longer was ambi∣tious of the musical Art nor the Poet descended to the Profession of Lyrist Singer or Actor Because these Professions which in the earliest Ages had been the Means of inculcating every thing laudable and great grew by Degrees of less and less Importance and being at length perverted to the contrary Purposes were in the End disdained by the wise and virtuous" These gra∣dual Separations of the several Branches of the Bard's complex Office and of Melody Dance and Song are not incurious in their ProgressionWe have seen that in the  earliest  Ages the  Gods  or  Legislators  themselves assumed the full and complex Character that they were  Poets Lyrists Singers  and  Dancers  The  Dance  seems first to have been se∣pated from the  Melody  and  Song  being soon heightened into the  Gymnastic  Art The  Legislators  by Degrees quitted the several Parts of the  Musician's  Character a Separation which  naturally arose from decreasing Enthusiasm and increasing Cares of Government As LINUS and ORPHEUS were the first so PYTHAGORAS and SOLON seem to have been the last who  composed  Songs and  sung  them to the sur∣rounding PeopleThe Profession of  Bard  or  Musician  was now become a  secondary  but  respectable  Character as being an Assistant to the Magistrate and an useful Servant of the State a Teacher of Religion and Morals The Bard  sung  and  played  always and led the  Dance  occasion∣ally But when HOMER's Poems had eclipsed every other Epic Strain another Separation followed The  Rhapsodists  arose in GREECE They sung HOMER's Poems to large surrounding Audiences They were strictly his  Represen∣tatives  who now gave his Poems to the People with that poetic Fire and Rapture which the Bard himself had possessed and exerted For in PLATO's  Ion  the  Rhapsodist  says that  "when he sings a piteous Tale his Eyes swim with Tears when he sings a terrible Event his Heart beats and his Hair stands erect"  In the earlier Ages of Tragedy the Poet both acted and sung But in the Time of SOPHOCLES another Separation parallel to the last ensued and the Province of  Actor  began to be di∣stinct from that of  Poet  Soon after this Time we find in the Passage quoted above from PLATO that a Separa∣tion of the  whole  Art of  Music  from its  proper Ends  took Place at ATHENS Its salutary Effects were now lost and as at this Period the Passion for illiberal  Comedy  came on so we learn from the concurrent Testimony of PLU∣TARCH  Sympos  l vii  and other Authors  JUSTIN l vi  that the Exhibition of  Tragedy  at ATHENS had now degenerated into mere  Pomp  and  Shew  equally expensive and pernicious The same respectable Ancient assures us that the  Dance  which had formerly been separated from the  Song  for warlike Pur∣poses was now corrupted by the  Mimes  in a very extra∣ordinary Degree  Sympos  l ix qu  The Consequence of these Corrup∣tions soon shewed themselves in a subsequent Period Hence in the Age of PLATO another Separation had come on For now the complex Name of  or  Bard  was disused and that of  or  Poet  had assumed its Place And as the  Legislator's  Office had formerly been separated from the  Bard's  so now in Consequence of this Corruption and as a natural Effect of Music's sinking into a mere  Amusement  the  Poet's  Character became quite distinct from that of  Chorist Actor  or  Dancer  and these distinct from each other  PLATO  de Repub  l ii  For the  moral  End being now  forgot  and nothing but  Amusement  attended to a higher Proficiency in these Arts became necessary and consequently a more severe Application to eachWe must now go back a little to catch the Rise of another Separation An Inroad was made into the Muse's Terri∣tories The public musical Contentions admitted  Prose  as an Aspirant to the Palm originally due to  Poetry  and  Song  HERODOTUS was the first who was crowned for  writing  and  speaking  or more properly for  singing History  at the public Contest  LUCIAN HERODOTUS  And it is remarkable that al∣though He brought down the  Song  to the  prosaic  Manner yet still his Work retained the  fabulous Air  as well as the  Appellation  of the  Muses  All which Circumstances con∣sidered in Union may lead us to the true  poetic  and  fabling  Genius of his celebrated History THUCIDIDES hints at this Practice in the Beginning of his noble Work  L i c  Declar∣ing that he means it not as a mere Exercise for the  public Contest  but as a valuable Possession for  AfterAges  In later Times it became a common Practice for  Sophists  and  Rhetoricians  to contend in  Prose  at the  Olympic  Games for the Crown of Glory  LUCIAN  de Salt  The  Delphic Oracles  kept Pace with these progressive Separations In the early Periods they were delivered by the  Pythia  with frantic Gesture  Dance Melody  and  Rythm  Above Art  In a succeeding Age we find the  Pythia  hath quitted her complex Cha∣racter  Poets  are appointed for the Service of the Tem∣ple and turn the  Oracles  into  Verse  But in the later Times this Practice had also ceased and the  Oracles  were given in plain Prose  STRABO l ix CICERO  de Div  l ii  In the Days of ARIS∣TOTLE a general and almost a total Separation had taken Place The Art of playing on the  Lyre  which had been the  Glory  of their early  Legislators  was now regarded as a  Reproach  to a young  King  The Art of  singing  which had once been a distinguishing Attribute of their  Gods  was now reckoned an ignoble Practice for a  Man  ARISTOT  Polit  l viii c  The  Chorus  of some of their Dramas gave Way to  Melody  merely  instru∣mental  which now first assumed the Name of  Music  The  Rhapsodists  had about this Time begun to quit a Part of  Their  Profession and instead of  singing  often  recited  HOMER's Poems  ARISTOT  Poet  c  To conclude all the great MasterCritic and Politician of GREECE viewing Music in that corrupt State which it held in his own Time though he still asserts its Use in private Education gives up the public Musical Exhibitions as only fit to gratify the Taste of an abandoned people  Polit  l viii c  But in the later Period when PLUTARCH writ its Utility had vanished even in private Life For He declares that  Music  which had formerly been so important and salutary in its Effects was now be∣come a mere Amusement of the Theatre and no longer applied to the Education of Youth  De Musica    "Hence the Power the Dignity and Utility of  Music  sunk into a general Corruption and Contempt" This is a Consequence too manifest to need a ProofAnd thus we have attempted to unfold the Nature Rise Progress Power Perfection and Corruption of MUSIC in ancient GREECE from the earliest Times when it was the  Glory  of their  Legislators  down to the later Periods when it became the  Employment  of their  Slaves  SECT VII Of the Origin and Progression of Comedy in ancient GREECE  THERE is one considerable Branch of the MUSIC of antient GREECE I mean COMEDY the Rise and Progression of which together with their Causes have been designedly passed in Silence Because if this Disquisition had been mixed with what hath been  delivered concerning the  Ode Epic  and  Tragedy  the Chain of Argument would have been broken and that Order and Clearness destroyed which it was necessary to preserve as much as possible in this involved Subject  Let us now proceed therefore to reduce the Origin and Progress of the  Greek Comedy  to their natural and essential CausesTo point out the Rise of this Poem from savage Life to unfold the true Reasons why it was so late in taking its legitimate Form in GREECE and then to ex∣plain on what Foundation the  old middle  and  new  Comedy appeared in their respective  Successions  In the Description of the savage Song Feasts given above from LAFITAU it appears that these warlike Tribes  "are still quicker at rallying than at praising each other He who dances takes whomsoever he pleaseth by the Hand and brings him forth into the midst of the Assem∣bly to which he yields without Resistance Mean while the Dancer continued to  sing  and sometimes in his Song and sometimes in the intervals he throws his Sarcasms on the Patient who hears him without Re∣plyAt every  bon Mot  loud Peals of Laughter arise along the Galleries who animate this Sport and often oblige the Patient to cover his Head in his Mantle  See above Sect ii  "  Now if we again suppose as we have already done that the Use of  Letters  should come among these savage Tribes and be cultivated with that spirit which is natural to a free and active People from this Picture as given by LAFITAU the following Consequences would naturally arise  "Their casual Strokes of Raillery would improve into written Invectives which would occasionally be sung by their sarcastic Choirs" Because nothing could be more alluring to a People of this satyric Turn than such a Repository of Wit and Raillery which like a Quiver stored with the keenest Arrows would be ever at Hand ready to be discharged against the occasional Objects of their Resentment  "Narrative or Epic Poems of the  invective  or  comic  Kind would likewise arise and be occasionally sung at their public Festivals" For the Spirit of Sarcasm being once awakened it would of course proceed from occasional Strokes of Raillery to the Recital of ridiculous Actions for the Gratification and Entertainment of a lively and satyric People  "From these two Species the  choral  and  narrative  united the first rude Outline of  Comedy  would arise" We have seen how  Tragedy  arose from parallel Causes And These would naturally take Place in producing  Comedy  For the  Narrative  already animated by Action would easily slide into dramatic Representation as in the Rise of  Tragedy  and the correspondent  Peals of Laughter  by the Assistance of written Invectives would assume the Form of a  comic Choir  "While the salutary Principles of Legislation should prevail Comedy thus formed would be little encouraged by the Leaders of the State" For the grander Kinds of Poetry already treated of containing the Principles of Religion Polity and Morals would draw their main Attention while their Comedy being no more than the  Vehicle of Ridicule and vague Invective would at most be only  endured  by prudent Legislators  "A provident Community of Principles uncom∣monly severe might even banish this Species of Poem as destructive to their State" Because nothing could be more dangerous to a Commonwealth established on Severity of Manners than the unbounded Licentiousness of Sentiment and Speech which this Comedy must tend to produce  "If in a State of more relaxed Principles where such Comedy had been tolerated a general Corruption of Manners should take Place among the People and if by any means such a corrupt People should over∣power the Magistrates and assume to themselves the Reins of Government then this Species of Co∣medy would rise into Credit and be publicly esta∣blished" For the  upright Leaders  of the State being  deposed  and the  Creatures  of such a  corrupt People  being seated in their  Place that Comedy  would now be  authorized  by Law which was most accommodated to the  Taste  and  Vices  of such a  corrupt People  "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy thus established would be pointed chiefly against those Ma∣gistrates or private Men whose Qualities would be hateful to the debauched Populace" For Corruption being now established as it were by Law that is by the Voice of a degenerate People which stood in the Place of Law the Poets would find it necessary to gratify the People's Vices as the surest Road to Success and the most certain Road to this must be by the  Ridicule of Virtue  "If a  Tyranny  should suddenly erect itself on the Ruins of such a People it would by its Authority  silence  this Species of  Comedy  "For every thing hateful to the People being now the established Subject of the comic Muse the Tyrants who had taken away the public Liberty must expect to become the Subject of Comedy if permitted to revel in its former Licentiousness  "The Poets would probably find a Subterfuge for the Gratification of the People and continue to repre∣sent  real Characters  under  feigned Names  " For this would be the only Species of Comedy they could pursue with a Probability of Success And this might be conti∣nued without much Danger if they were cautious with Respect to the Persons of the Tyrants  "If a great Conqueror should arise and by sub∣duing a Variety of Nations should open a Communi∣cation between such a State and others of more luxurious and refined Manners this  second  Species of Comedy would naturally receive a  Polish  and instead of the in∣direct personal Invective would assume the more deli∣cate Form of general Raillery and become a Picture of human Life"For one of the first Efforts of a growing Politeness is to avoid all Occasions of  Offence  and this without Respect to any Consequences either good or bad which may affect the Public but merely from a selfish Regard to the Opinion of  Elegance  and the Pride of  Urbanity  In Support of these Deductions let us now endeavour to  realize  them by shewing that such Consequences did arise in GREECE And in the Course of this Argument the Writer hopes he shall be able to disclose the true Causes  of the Progression of the ancient Comedy so different from that of the higher Kinds of Poetic Composition  "In the earliest Periods of the Greek States their Casual Strokes of Raillery were improved into written Invectives and were occasionally sung by their sarcastic Choirs" These written Invectives were in Fact so early that all the Greek Writers with one Voice confess themselves altogether ignorant of their Origin Their first Appearance is ascribed by different Authors to different Nations  See VOSSIUS  Inst Poët  l ii c  and no Wonder if Evidence be wanting in Support of each Pretence when it is probable that these sarcastic Choirs arose in many of the  Greek  States nearly at the same Time that is in or about the first Periods of Civilization and Letters For we have seen that such a Period would naturally produce them  "Because nothing could be more alluring to a People of the satyric Turn than such a Repository of Raillery and Sarcasm"  How∣ever we must not omit to observe that their Traditions are much more accommodated to Nature and Probability on this Subject than on the Rise of the tragic Choir which they seem generally to have attributed to the single Prac∣tice of the drunken Votaries of BACCHUS  "Narrative or Epic Poems of the invective or comic Kind arose and were occasionally sung at their public Festivals" For the truth of this Fact we have the Testimony of ARISTOTLE who tells us  "that although we know not the names either of these Poems or their Authors yet there is Reason to believe that many had been written before HOMER and that his  Margites  brought this Species to its Perfection in the same Manner as the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  had compleated the Form of the Epic Poem  Poët  c  "  That HOMER as well as other Bards of the early Periods sung their comic Poems at the festal Solemnities needs no farther Proof here  "From these two Species the  Choral  and  Narrative  united the first rude Outline of Comedy arose" The  Narrative  already animated by a lively Action did easily slide into  dramatic  Representation and the correspondent Peals of  Laughter  excited among the surrounding Audience by means of written Invectives assumed the Form of the  comic Choir  In this Point we have again to contend with the general Body of Critics from ARISTOTLE down to the present Times who all concur in ascribing the Rise of the legitimate Form of Comedy to HOMER's  Margites  in the same Manner as they have ascribed the Rise of  Tragedy  to the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  But notwith∣standing this general Concurrence of Opinion it seems evident that the Progression of Comedy was founded in the same Causes with that of Tragedy That they both natu∣rally arose in the Course of Things from an Union of the  Narration  and the  Choir  without any Respect had to HO∣MER's Poems The same Arguments that have proved the one will confirm the other We see the natural Seeds of Comedy and scenic Representation in savage Life no less than those of Tragedy  See above Sect ii  Nay even in the earliest Periods of GREECE itself we shall find the first rude Form of Comedy arising from an Union of  dramatic Representation  and a  Choir  long before HOMER existed In the Account  already cited from STRABO and others of the  musical Contest  established at DELPHI which in Time branched out into the  Pythian  Games as we have found the first rude Form of  Tragedy  so now we shall find likewise a faint Outline of the first rude Form of  Comedy  For it appears that APOLLO with his Choir and his Worshipers in aftertimes not only represented his Victory and sung a Paean in Consequence of it in which Union we see the first rude Form of Tragedy but likewise in the Way of Ridicule they represented the  Hisses  of the dying Serpent and sung an  Invective  or  Sarcasm  on his overthrow  See the Authors cited above Sect v Art  For so I understand the Word  and  used by these ancient Writers on this Occasion as implying only  Sarcastic Verses  and not  Iambics  in the strict Sense which are generally believed to have been first formed by ARCHI∣LOCHUS many Ages after the Fact here alluded to And hence the true Reason appears why the  Greek  Comedy was written in  Verse  because it was originally  sung  Now in this Union of  comic Representation  and a  satyrical Choir  we see the genuine though imperfect and  rude Form  of the  old Greek Comedy  "While the salutary Principles of Legislation pre∣vailed Comedy thus formed was little encouraged by the Leaders of the State" The Authority of ARIS∣TOTLE is clear and decisive on this Point  "Comedy remained obscure and unknown because little Regard was had to it from the Beginning the Magistrate being late in appointing it a Choir"  He assigns no Reason for this Conduct of the Magistrate But a sufficient  Reason appears to be given above  "For the grander Kinds of Poetry containing the Principles of Religion Polity and Morals drew their main Attention while their Comedy being no more than the Vehicle of Ridi∣cule and vague Invective was only  endured  by prudent Legislators"  The Truth of this Article will receive Confirmation from the two succeeding  "There was a provident Community of Principles uncommonly severe which even banished this Species of Poem as destructive to their State" We have already seen the Providence and Caution of the  Spartans  in regu∣lating their  Music  for the Security of their Republic  See above  We shall now see the admirable Consistency of their Conduct with Respect to the very Beginnings of  Comedy  when it first dawned among them in the Verses of ARCHI∣LOCHUS  "The  Spartans  ordered the Writings of ARCHILOCHUS to be banished from their City because they thought the Perusal of them was dangerous to the Purity of Manners They did not chuse that the Minds of their Children should be tainted with them lest they should more hurt their Morals than sharpen their Wit  VELL  Patere  l vi c  In after Times when the severe Man∣ners and the Glory of this Republic sunk together we find its Conduct altogether correspondent with these Principles The  Mimes  the most dissolute Species of Comedy were then admitted See SUIDAS ATHE∣NAEUS and other Authors of the later Periods  "  "In the Republic of ATHENS which was of more relaxed Principles where this Comedy had been tolerated a general Corruption of Manners took Place  among the People The corrupt People overpowered the Magistrates assumed to themselves the Reins of Government and on this Foundation the old Comedy arose into Credit had a Choir appointed by the Magi∣strate and was publicly established" This was the natural and necessary Consequence of the Power of a corrupt People For the upright Magistrates being de∣posed and the Creatures of this corrupt People seated in their Place  that  Comedy was now authorized by Law which was most accommodated to the Vices and Taste of a dissolute Populace  These Causes clearly account for the Establishment of the old Comedy at that very Period when it took Place But as other Causes void of all Foundation have been assigned for this by various Authors it will be necessary to prove the Truth of the Causes here alledged from the Authority of the Greek Writers  PLATO in the Passage cited above  See Sect v Art  gives us the History of the Corruption of the People and of Music but in such general Terms that without some farther Evidence it is impossible clearly to fix the Time when or the Means by which this Change was brought about so fatal to the Republic of  Athens  It happens fortunately that PLUTARCH hath recorded the Event with such Particularity of Circumstance as leaves no Room to doubt on this Subject PERICLES was the Man who for his own private Ends of Popularity effected this ruinous Change For  "By giving the People the Plunder and Possession of the Lands taken from the Enemy and by  squandering the public Monies formerly reserved for the Uses of War in SHEWS and PLAYS for their  Enter∣tainment  and by Grants of Largesses and Pensions he changed them from a sober modest and thrifty People who maintained themselves by their own Labour into a riotous and debauched Multitude and thus roused them into sedition against the Court of the  Areopagus  In Pericle  "  From this Passage it is evident that PERICLES not only debauched the  Athenian  People but that the Exhibition of Plays and Shews was one of the very Engines of Cor∣ruption  Thus CICERO speaks of the old Greek Comedy  "Esto popu∣lares Homines improbos in Rempublicam seditiosos  Cleonem Cleo∣phontem Hyperbolum  laesitPatiamurSed PERICLEM cum jam suae Civitati maxima Auctoritate plurimos annos Domi et Bello praefuisset violari Versibus et eos agi in Scena non plus decuit quam si  Plautus  noster voluisset aut  Naevius P  et  Cn Scipioni  aut  Caecilius M Catoni  maledicere"  Ex Frag CIC de Rep l iv  Where we may ob∣serve the Judgment of CICERO is false concerning PERICLES As it ap∣pears that he was the first Corrupter of the People And it seems to have been a just Punishment that he was lashed by that illiberal Comedy which His own Influence first let in upon the State  The concurrent Testimony of XENOPHON clears the whole Affair and gives as a full View of the Consequences of this general Corruption so far as the  old Comedy  is concerned For in his Discourse on the  Athe∣nian  Republic he informs us  st  That at the Period we have now fixed  "The Body of the People expelled All Good Men from the Magistracy and advanced wicked Men in their Places"    dly  That  "they took the  Gymnastic  and  Musical  Exercises out of the Hands of the better Sort and gave the Practice and Profit of them to the Dregs of the People"    dly  That  "in their  Comedies they suffered none to be ridiculed but those of higher Station and Worth unless one of their own Rank happened to distinguish himself by something praise worthy and then He became the Object of theatrical Derision  XENOPHON  de Rep  ATHEN  "  These Evidences are so clear and precise as to leave no Foundation of a Doubt on this Subject  Lord SHAFTESBURY hath greatly mistaken this Matter in his  Advice to an Author  Characteristics  vol i  and is as careless or defec∣tive here in the Circumstance of Erudition as at other times in that of Reasoning He seems in one Passage to attri∣bute the late Cultivation and Establishment of the old Comedy to its being of more  difficult  Composition than Tragedy  "In this Part Tragedy the Poets succeeded sooner than in Comedy or the facetious Kind as it was natural indeed to suppose since this was in reality the easiest easier Manner of the two"  This is deciding a doubtful Point by a mere Affirmation For the com∣parative Difficulty of these two Kinds hath been treated at large by a learned and most judicious Writer who after a candid and profound Discussion of the Question thinks it best to leave it undecided  BRUMOY  Theatre des Grecs  tom vi  This Question hath indeed been said by a learned Writer to admit of a  decisive Answer  on this Principle that  "Tragedy whose End is the  Pathos  produces it by  Action  while Comedy produces its End the  Humorous  by  Character  Now it is much more difficult to  paint Manners  than to  plan Action  because That requires the  Philosopher's Knowledge  of  human Nature  this only the  Historian's Knowledge  of  human Events  "  But in the Course of this Argument it seems entirely forgot that the tragic Poet's Province is not only to  plan  but to  paint  too Had he no farther Task than what depends on the mere  Historian's Knowledge  of  human Events  the Reasoning would hold But as it is the first and most essential Effort of his Genius in the Construction of a  compleat  Tragedy to  invent  and  order  a  pathetic  Plan  consistent  in all it's Parts and  rising  towards it's  Com∣pletion  by a  Succession  of Incidents which may  keep up  and continually  in∣crease Terror  or  Pity  it is manifest that the  Perfection  of his  Plan  depends not on his mere  historic Knowledge  of  human Events  but on his  philosophic Discernment  of  human Passions  aided by a  warm  and  enlarged Invention  Talents as rare at least as the  Knowledge  or  Discernment  of  human Cha∣racters  If to this we add the subsequent Task of giving the  high Colourings  of  Passion  to the tragic  Plan  thus  ordered  the  Difficulty  of writing a compleat  Tragedy  may seem to be in some Respects  equal  in others  superior  to that of producing a compleat  Comedy  For in the  Conduct  of this last Species it is acknowledged that a  small Degree  of  poetic Invention  will  support  it  The noble Writer next seems to attribute the late Cultivation of Comedy to  "the Spirit of literary Criticism which in the Nature  of things could not arise till it had Materials to work on and This he supposeth to have been the  false Sublime  of their  Tragedies  which were often  parodied  in the  old Comedy  "  But neither can this Cause be sufficient to account for the Effect because it appears that the best Men as well as the best Tragedies were parodied or ridiculed more commonly than the worst Of this the Fate of SOCRATES may stand as a convincing Proof This Fact could not entirely escape the Notice of the noble Writer for he acknowledges that  "even this  Remedy  it∣self was found to turn into a  Disease  P  "  But we have already proved that it was a Disease even on its first Appear∣ance In a Word the Authorities given above in Support of the true Causes of the Cultivation and Establishment of the old Greek Comedy at ATHENS contain the clearest Proof that the noble Writer's Deductions on this Subject are  specious  but  not solid  and that he discovers but little of what he seems to value so much  "a Comprehension of  ancient Manners and ancient History"  But what is odd enough after having separately assigned these ficti∣tious Causes as being each the Foundation on which the old Comedy arose and was established He at length glances accidentally upon the true one Yet manifestly without any particular Knowledge of the Facts which support it  "According to this  Homerical  Lineage of Poetry  Comedy  would naturally prove the  Drama  of  latest Birth  For though ARISTOTLE cites HOMER's  Margites  as analo∣gous to  Comedy  yet the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  in which the heroic Style prevails having been ever  highest in Esteem  were likeliest to be  first wrought and cultivated  Characteristics  vol i p Notes  "  We may conclude then upon the Authority of the three great Ancients cited above that  "the Cultivation and  Establishment  of the old  Greek Comedy  arose from the united  Corruption  and  Power  of the  Athenian  Peo∣ple"  "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy thus established was pointed chiefly against those Magistrates or private Men whose Qualities were hateful to the debauched Populace" For the Proof of this the Read∣er is referred to the Passages already cited from PLATO and XENOPHON And on this Solution the Fate of SO∣CRATES is clearly accounted for Nor could any thing be more natural if the Causes here assigned for the Esta∣blishment of the old Comedy be true  "For Corruption being now established as it were by Law that is by the Voice of a degenerate People which stood in the Place of Law the Poets found it necessary to gratify the People's Vices as the surest Road to Success and  the only Road to this was now by the  Ridicule  of  Virtue  "  "A Tyranny suddenly erected itself on the Ruins of the corrupt  Athenian  People and at once silenced this Species of Comedy" This Event happened on the taking of ATHENS by LYSANDER and thro' the Authority of the thirty Tyrants whom he established there These  Op∣pressors  did That from  Fear  which  upright  Magistrates would have done from  Virtue  The plain Reason hath been assigned above  "Because every thing hateful to the People being now the established Subject of the comic Muse the Tyrants who had destroyed the public Liberty must expect to become the Subject of Comedy if permitted to revel in its former Licentiousness"  Here again the noble Author of the Characteristics seems to assign a fictitious Cause for this Event drawn from his own Conjectures instead of History  "Nothing could have been the Cause of this gradual Reform in the Commonwealth of Wit beside the real Reform of Taste and Humour in the Commonwealth or Government itself"  For saith he  "it  little concerned  the  Foreigners in Power  the thirty Tyrants after what Manner those  Citizens  treated  one another  in their  Comedies  or what sort of Wit or Humour they made Choice of for their ordinary Diversions  Characteristics  vol i p  "  It can hardly be necessary to point out in what Circumstance this Reasoning is defective Had the private Citizens buffooned  each other only  in their  Comedies  the  Thirty Tyrants  would indeed have had little to fear But as it is evident that the  public Magistrates  and their  Conduct  had been the standing  Objects of theatrical Ridicule it certainly  much concerned  these  Foreigners in Power  to prevent that sarcastic Repre∣sentation of their oppressive Government which they must necessarily expect from the keen Spirit of an exasperated and licentious People The noble Writer endeavours to confirm his Opinion by a parallel Instance drawn from the  Roman  Commonwealth where a similar Prohibition took Place with regard to the  Atellane  Fables at a Time when no Effects of foreign  "Power or of a home Ty∣ranny can be pretended  P  "  But this Instance joyned to the Evidences already given on the Subject instead of confirming overturns his System It only proves what was alledged above that the  Athenian Tyrants  did that from  Fear  which the  Roman Magistrates  did from  Virtue  "The Poets found a Subterfuge for the Gratification of the People and continued to represent real Cha∣racters under feigned Names" Thus the  middle Co∣medy  was naturally established For this was the only Species which they could now pursue with any Proba∣bility of  Success  And this was continued without much  Danger  as we find they were cautious with Respect to the Persons of the TyrantsThat such was the true Origin of this Change in the Character of the Greek Comedy appears farther from the two following Con∣siderations First there is not the least Reason to be∣lieve the Athenian People were at all changed from their coarse Manners and profligate Character at the Time when the old Comedy was silenced And secondly by the Accounts left concerning the Genius of the  mid∣dle Comedy  it appears that it was in all Respects as  illiberal and buffooning in its Beginnings as the old Comedy had been the single Circumstance of  nominal Designation  only accepted  "A great  Conqueror  arose And by subduing a Variety of Nations opened a  Communication  between the Commonwealth of ATHENS and the  eastern  King∣doms which were of more  luxurious  and  refined  Man∣ners On this Event the  second  or  middle  Species of  Comedy  naturally received a  Polish  and laying aside the indirect personal Invective assumed the more delicate Form of general Raillery and became a Picture of human Life" The learned Reader will easily see that ALEXANDER  the Great  is the Conqueror here alluded to in his Reign it was and not till that late Period that the  middle  Comedy was polished into the  new  This was the natural Effect of that Politeness which was introduced at ATHENS by a frequent and familiar Commerce with the effeminate Nations of the East Till then although the  Athenians  justly boasted a Superiority in the  Arts  yet in their Converse and Treatment of each other the concurrent Authority of ancient Historians as well as the more certain Testimony of their own remaining Comedies assure us that they were of an  illiberal  and  buffooning  Turn But no sooner were the  Asiatic  Luxuries and Re∣finements brought to ATHENS by the Conquests of ALEXANDER than their coarse Manners melted gradually into false Politeness and Effeminacy Now  "one of the first Effects of a growing Politeness is to avoid all Occasions of Offence and this without Respect to any Consequences either good or bad which may affect  the Public but merely from a selfish Regard to the Opinion of  Elegance  and the Pride of  Urbanity  "  This Reasoning coincides in all Respects with the last Progression of Comedy at ATHENS And those Writers as Lord SHAFTESBURY and the Author of the Life of HOMER who have attempted to resolve the Establishment of the new Comedy into a  Reform  or  Improvement  of Manners in a  virtuous  Sense have mistaken  Shadows  for  Realities  and confounded  Decency  with  Virtue  For it is certain that both private and public Virtue were at the lowest Ebb while Comedy was assuming its  new  and finished Form This we are assured of by the concurrent Testimony of PLUTARCH JUSTIN and other ancient Writers Even so far were the  Athenians  from regarding the public Welfare or Defence of their Country that it was made a capital Crime for any Man to propose the Re∣establishment of their Militia or the Application of the public Funds to its Maintenance  LIBANIUS  Arg ad  OLYNTH I  Their Vices there∣fore were not  lessening  but  refining  And the Idea of  Decency  was sliding in to supplant the rougher Appearances of  Virtue  We know a neighbour Nation in which parallel Effects prevail a Nation who are too generally  "licentious in private Morals though in public Conduct decent"  And it is remarkable that from this Refine∣ment in Vices a Species of Manners and of Comedy  there  prevails altogether similar to those of the later  Greeks  For while their private Conversation abounds with  Irre∣ligion Immorality  and  Obscenity  nothing is admitted on their Stage but what is consistent with  Piety good Morals  and  good Breeding  SECT VIII Of the natural Union and Progressions of Melody and Song in other European Countries  THUS we have traced the Progression of the ancient  Greek  MUSIC in all its Branches through the various Stages of their Union and Power down to their final Separation and Corruption in the later Periods As a Confirmation of the essential Principles offered in this Discourse let us now consider this natural Union and Progression as it hath appeared in other Nations where these Arts never arrived at so compleat a Form where the Progression ceased before any high Degree of Per∣fection came on either through a Want of improving Lite∣rature or by other Obstructions from internal or external Causes  The nearest Approach we can make to the savage State in any Instance drawn from the Records of Antiquity seems to be found in the History of the  Curetes  or  Cory∣bantes  of the Island of CRETE STRABO and DIODORUS who give us their History describe them as barbarous Tribes of Men living among Caves and Mountains at once  Warriors Priests Poets  and  Musicians  who cele∣brated their public Festivals with enthusiastic and clamor∣ous Music Song and Dance accompanied with Drums Cymbals and other noisy Instruments almost in the very Manner of the savage Iroquois  STRABO l x DIODORUS l v  RHADAMAN∣THUS first and then MINOS civilized this barbarous Route and regulated their Manners and their Music on  the Model of the severe  Egyptian  Legislation After MINOS THALES arose In whom we find the united Characters of Legislator and Musician He composed Laws for the  Cretan  State and sung them to his Lyre  As THALES succeeded RHADAMANTHUS and MINOS who had  both  copied the EGYPTIAN Forms of Legislation his composing  Laws  in  Verse  could only be the Effect of mere  Imitation  But Music being fixed to certain Forms by Law we are not to wonder that its Progression stopped as at SPARTA which Commonwealth was modelled on the rigorous Esta∣blishment of CRETE  With Respect to EGYPT the Beginnings of that famous Kingdom are so lost in its Antiquity that we know no∣thing of the first Advances there made in  Music  from its original Savage State We only read that in some early Period of Civilization its Forms were unalterably fixed by Law and therefore all  Improvement  and  Corruption  alike  prevented  As to the more  northern  Nations of  Europe  it is re∣markable that we know little of them from ancient His∣tory till the second Period of Music commenced that is till the  Legislator's  Character had been  separated  from that of the  Musician  The clearest Instance of the Union of the  Legislator's  and  Bard's  Character is found in SNORRO STURLOSON who about five Hundred and fifty Years ago was at once the chief  Legislator  and most eminent  Bard  in the Isle of ICELAND  Preface to NICHOLSON's  Irish Hist Library  In the second Period we meet with the poetic and musical Character united in almost every northern Clime under the revered Denomi∣nation of  Scaldi  or  Bards  It hath been already observed that ODIN the  Scythian  Legislator boasted that the  Runic  Songs had heen given him by the Gods  See above Sect v  A Circum∣stance which proves that the Character of  Heroe  and  Musician  had been united in the Chiefs of that fierce and savage People in the Period which immediately preceded him We learn from SHERINGHAM and BARTHOLINE that after the first Separation had been made the  Scaldi Musicians  or  Bards  were a Race of Men highly honoured among the  Scythian  or  Danish  Tribes That their Songs were of the  legislative  Cast that they sung the great Actions of their Ancestors were themselves renowned War∣riors and kindled the Valour of their Armies by their Songs That none were admitted of the Order but those of the most distinguished Families  SHERINGHAM  de Angl Orig  p  That they were above the Meanness of Flattery and were revered even in the Courts of Kings  BARTHOLINUS  de Contemptu Mortis apud Danos  l i c    We meet with the  Gaulish Bards  under the same Period of Separation But their Spirit seems to have been con∣trouled by a more  peaceable  Species of Legislation For STRABO tells us that  "throughout the whole District of GAUL there are three Kinds of Men who are held in singular Honour The  Bards  the  Vates  and the  Druids  The  Bards  are  Poets  and  sing  their Hymns The  Vates  perform  Sacrifice  and  contemplate  the Nature of Things The  Druids  besides this hold Discourses on  Morals  They are esteemed the justest of Men and therefore are intrusted with the Determination of all Differences public and private and sometimes peace∣ably end a Quarrel when Armies are drawn out and ready to decide it by the Sword  L iv  "  The Evidence of  DIODORUS is still more particular and proves that they were not insensible to the original Sallies of comic and sarcastic Wit  "They sing saith He to Instruments resembling our Lyres  praising  some and  satyrizing  others When Armies are ready to engage if they but come between they immediately put an End to the Battle as if their Warriors were so many wild Beasts which they had charmed by the Power of their  Songs  DION l v  "  The  British Bards  about the same Time were precisely of the same Character as we learn from their contem∣porary  Roman  Authors  A singular Circumstance relative to the  British Bards  deserves No∣tice It is said that  "although they were  inferior  to the  Druids  in  Rank  yet they were  prior  in  Antiquity  "  SAMMES's  Phoenic Ant of Brit    A Circumstance which though improbable in it's first Appearance is clearly accounted for on the Principles of this Dissertation as it only implies that  Melody  and  Song  were  prior  to  religious Rites  See Sect v Art  In a succeeding Period when the Distractions of our Country had driven the native  Britons  into WALES an  English  King still felt their Power amidst the Mountains and Poverty of that barren Region He was so highly exasperated by the Influence of their Songs which breathed the Spirit of Liberty and War and retarded his Conquest over a hardy People that he basely ordered them to be slain An Event which hath lately given Birth to an elegant and sublime Strain of Poetry  An Ode by Mr GRAY    Of the Genius of those  British Bards  who inhabited the northern Districts of the Island we have a noble Proof in the Poems lately published under the Name of OSSIAN These appear to have been composed and sung during the second Period of Music that is when the Bard's Pro∣fession  had separated from that of the Legislator yet still retained its Power and Dignity in full Union For OSSIAN the declared Author of the Poems was the Son of the royal FINGAL accompanied him in his Wars and sung his Atchievements to the Harp These Poems give a noble Confirmation to many of the Principles ad∣vanced in this Analysis They are of various Forms though none of them properly unmixed The  Song  in the Days of this sublime and original Bard appears evi∣dently to have worn the  inartificial  and  mixed  Forms of Composition which we have found generally and of Course to prevail in the early Periods Thus FINGAL is chiefly  Epic  yet the  hymnal  Species abounds in it Others are  dramatic  yet in these the  narrative  often takes Place Others again are in the Form of  Odes  yet even these are strongly mixed and marked with the  Epic  and  dramatic  Manner  As these Circumstances are internal Proofs of the  Antiquity  of the Poems so there are other collateral Evidences of the same Nature which seem clearly to confirm it Such are the grand Simplicity of Imagery and Diction the strong Draughts of rude Manners and uncultivated Scenes of Nature which abound in all these Poems Pictures which no civilized Modern could ever imbibe in their Strength nor consequently could ever throw out Such again are the frequent Allusions wrought into the very Essence of the Poems to the Principles of the old  Celtic  Religion which in ancient times had overspread these Kingdoms Of this Nature is That which the Translator calls the  most extravagant Fiction  in all OSSIAN's Poems I mean the Battle between FINGAL and the Ghost or Spirit of LODA  CarricThura  A Poem  Now this though it carries the Appearance of Extravagance and illjudged Improbability yet upon a nearer View will be sound to contain an internal Evidence of the  Antiquity  of the Poem as it is drawn from the very Essence of the old  Celtic  Belief Thus speaks the learned BARTHOLINE  "Summa Audacia credebatur Lucta cum Spectris non formidata  De Contemptu Mortis apud Danes  l ii c  " "It was esteemed the highest Act of Courage to dare to encounter a Ghost"  But it must be ob∣served that the Spirit of their chief God ODIN was an Exception to this Rule The Living and the Dead were all deemed subject to his Controule therefore the Spirit of LODA was not the Spirit of ODIN but of some inferior Deity    The natural Flame of savage Music and Poetry is now almost entirely quenched in the several Parts of this Island  In  England  it lost its Power by the Migration of the native  Britons  into WALES In Wales it was quenched by the Cruelty of EDWARD In the Highlands of SCOT∣LAND the Writer is well informed that the Bard's Pro∣fession was upheld in some Degree of Honour till near the Beginning of this Century About which Time the Communication of the Inhabitants with the more civilized Parts of the Kingdom by Degrees assimilated their Man∣ners to those of their Neighbours by which means the Profession became extinct  About the Close of the last Century JOHN GLASS and JOHN MACDONALD  Bards  by Profession who resided and were respected as such in the Houses of two  Highland Chiefs  traveled fifty Miles and met by Appointment in LOCHABAR to vindicate their own Honour and that of their respective Chiefs at a public Meeting in a  poetic  and  musical Contest    The History of the  Irish Bards  is perhaps of all others the most extraordinary and will therefore deserve a par∣ticular Regard History doth not carry us up to the first Period in which the  Legislator's  and  Bard's  Cha∣racter are united in the same Person But of the second Period we have large Accounts in the  Irish  Historians For we are informed there were three principal Tribes among the ancient  Irish  "The First were  Leaders Chiefs  or  Legislators  The Second were  Druids  or  Priests  "  The Third were  Bards  The two last were  honoured with an Appellation equivalent to the Name of  Gods  KEATING's  Hist  of IRELAND p    The  Bards  had estates settled on them that they might be free from worldly Cares They lived in perfect In∣dependence and were obliged to no Service Their Per∣sons were inviolable To kill them was esteemed the blackest Crime and it was held an Act of Sacrilege to seize their Estates even for the public Service and in Times of the greatest Distress  Ib p c    The Profession was hereditary But when the  Bard  died his Estate descended not to his eldest Son but to the most accomplished of his Family in the musical Profession A Law was made by OLLAMH FODHLA one of their greatest Kings that none should be invested with the Dignity of a  Bard  but those of the most illustrious Families  Ibid    The  Bards  the  Druids  and  Nobility  were summoned by the same King to a  triennial Festival  which was thus by him established to transmit to Posterity the  Authentic Songs  of the  Bards  as the Materials of their future His∣tories In Consequence of this the approved Songs of the ancient Bards were preserved in the Custody of the King's Antiquary and are appealed to by KEATING as the Foundation of his History  Ib p Preface p  Many of them were fabulous but this Circumstance hath no essential Relation to our present Inquiry  Garments of different Colour were appropriated to the various Ranks of the Kingdom So high was the Power  and Dignity of the  Bards  that they wore the  same Colour  with the  royal Family  KEATING's  Hist  of IRELAND p    Thus invested with Honours Wealth and Power and possessed of an Art which gave them a natural Influence over the Minds of the People we find that about the year they had become insolent deeply corrupted and dangerous Hence the reigning King convened a general Council of the Nobility and Gentry for Christi∣anity being now planted in IRELAND the  Druids  were no more with Intention to expel them the Island They were now become a Kind of  sacred Order  or  College  which was grow so numerous that one third of the Kingdom is said to have ranked themselves in this Class as a safe Asylum for Idleness and Hypocrisy When the  Principal Bards  assembled in a Body to divert this im∣pending Storm they met to the Number of a  Thousand  This may account for the Numbers that claimed to be of the Profession for every  Principal Bard  retained  thirty  of inferior Note as his Attendants and a  Bard  of the  second  Order was followed by a Retinue of  fifteen  In this Convention after many Debates it was resolved that they should leave the Island and retire into SCOTLAND be∣fore the Sentence of their Banishment was pronouncedHowever the Sentence was mitigated They were al∣lowed to disperse themselves over the Island and promised to live in a Manner less offensive to the Public  Ib c    In a succeeding and no very distant Period we find them again grown troublesome to the Kings who com∣plained  of them as a Burthen to the People lazy covet∣ous and insatiable On this their Number was lessened and regulated By the Advice of St COLUM CILL every provincial  Chief  had  one  learned  Bard  allowed him in his Retinue to  record  the  Atchievements  of his Family Their Independance with a competent Revenue was preserved And this Regulation was the Standard by which the Society of Bards were directed in succeeding Ages  KEATING's  Hist  of IRELAND p    'Tis to be observed that in some unrecorded Period a  Separation  had taken Place in the  Bard's  Profession In the early Times the Offices of  Poet  and  Lyrist  were united in the same Person In the later Ages it appears that the  Bard  only composed the  Poem  and that it was  sung  by a  Rhapsodist  or  Harper  at the public Festivals  However we find that on the Extinction of Learn∣ing and Increase of Barbarism in this Kingdom the native Vigour of the poetic Stock again shot up in a succeeding Age and for Want of a proper Culture was again become one of the ruling Evils of the Coun∣try in the Time of SPENSER Who gives the follow∣ing animated Description of their  Songs  and  Cha∣racter  "There is amongst the  Irish  a certain Kind of People called  Bardes  which are to them instead of  Poets  whose Profession is to set forth the  Praises  or  Dispraises  of Men in their Poems or Rythmes the which are had in so high Regard and Estimation amongst them that none dare displease them for Fear to run into Reproach through their Offence and to be made  infamous in the Mouths of all Men For their Verses are taken up with a general Applause and usually  sung  at all  Feasts  and  Meetings  by certain  other Persons  whose proper Function that is who also receive for the same great Rewards and Reputation amongst them""These  Irish Bardes  are for the most Part so far from instructing young Men in  moral  Discipline that they themselves do more deserve to be sharply disciplined For they seldom use to choose unto themselves the Doings of  good  Men for the Arguments of their Poems but whomsoever they find to be most  licentious  of Life most  bold  and  lawless  in his Doings most  danger∣ous  and  desperate  in all Parts of Disobedience and rebel∣lious Disposition Him they  set up  and  glorify  in their  Rythmes  Him they  praise  to the  People  and to  young  Men make an  Example  to follow"Thus "evil things being decked and attired with the gay Attire of goodly Words may easily deceive and carry away the Affection of a young Mind that is not well stayed but desirous by some bold Adventures to make Proof of himself For being as they all be brought up idely without Awe of Parents without Precepts of Masters and without Fear of Offence not being directed nor employed in any Course of Life which may carry them to Virtue will easily be drawn to follow such as any shall set before them For a young Mind cannot rest If he be not still busied in some Goodness he will find himself such Business as shall soon busy all about him In which if he shall find any to praise him and to give him Encouragement as those  Bardes  and  Rythmers  do for little Reward or a Share of a  stoln Cow  then  waxeth he most insolent and half mad with the Love of himself and his own lewd Deeds And as for Words to set off such Lewdness it is not hard for them to give a goodly and painted shew thereunto borrowed even from the Praises which are proper to Virtue itself As of a most notorious  Thief  and wicked  Outlaw  which had lived all his Life Time of  Spoils  and  Robberies  one of their  Bardes  in his Praise will say that he was none of the idle  MilkSops  that was brought up by the  Fireside  but that most of his Days he spent in  Arms  and valiant  Enterprises  That he did never eat his Meat before he had won it with his Sword That he lay not all Night slugging in a Cabin under his Mantle but used commonly to keep others waking to defend their Lives and did light his Candle at the Flames of their Houses to lead him in the Darkness That the Day was his Night and the Night his Day That he loved not to be long wooing of Wenches to yield to him but where he came he took by Force the Spoil of other Men's Love and left but Lamentation to their Lovers That his Music was not the Harp nor Lays of Love but the Cries of People and the clashing of Armour And finally that he died not bewailed of many but made many wail when he died that dearly bought his Death""I have caused divers of these Poems to be translated unto me that I might under∣stand them And surely they savoured of  sweet Wit  and  good Invention  but  skilled not  of the  goodly Orna∣ments  of Poetry Yet were they sprinkled with some  pretty Flowers  of their  natural Device  which gave good Grace and Comeliness unto them The which it is  great Pity  to see so  abused  to the  gracing  of  Wickedness  and  Vice  which with  good Usage  would serve to  adorn  and  beautify Virtue  SPENSER's View of the State of IRELAND  "  This Account of the  Irish Bards  is not inserted here as a mere History of Facts but with a farther View of confirming the Principles on which this Dissertation is built And the Writer thinks that all the Facts from the  early State  of the  Bards  when they were esteemed as  Gods  down to their  last Condition  when they were sunk into the  Abetters  of  Thieving  and  Robbery  arise so naturally from the Principles given above that he is disposed to leave the particular Application to the Reader's Sagacity  SECT IX Of the natural Union and Progressions of Melody and Song in CHINA PERU and INDIA  SUCH have been the natural  Union  and  Progressions  of  Melody  and  Song  in the babarous Nations of EUROPE If we travel to the Extremes of East and West on the vast Continents of ASIA and AMERICA we shall find new and strong Confirmations of the  Progressions  of these Arts as they have been here deduced from savage Life and Manners  The  Chinese  have ever been of a  mild  and  peaceable  Cha∣racter Their  Music  will be found analogous 'Tis generally supposed that CONFUCIUS established their  Music  and  Rites  but it appears from some curious Fragments of ancient  Chinese  History that  Music  and the  Rites  existed in  Union  long before the Age of that Philosopher  Extraits des Hist Chinois  published by Mr GOGUET p    "TCHO∣YONG  the sixteenth Emperor of the ninth Period hearing a Concert of Birds invented a Species of Music whose Harmony was irresistible It touched the intelligent Soul and calmed the Heart of Man so that the exter∣nal Senses were sound the Humours in a just Poise and the Life of Man lengthened  Extraits des Hist Chinois  published by Mr GOGUET p  "  Here we find the genuine Picture of a  Chief  at once  Legislator  and  Bard  civilizing a savage People  The  Dance  was improved in the same Manner by the twentieth King of the ninth Period to the Ends of peace∣ful Life  Ib  And of such Importance has this Branch of the musical Art been always held in CHINA that it it is an established Maxim  "that you may judge of any King's Reign by the  Dances  that are then in Use  Ib p  "  These Evidences are traditionary and relate to the fabulous Times But even in a later Period we find the  kingly  and  musical  Characters  united  in the Person of FOUHI their first great imperial Legislator  "FOUHI de∣livered the Laws of Music After he had invented the Art of  Fishing  he composed a  Song  for those who ex∣ercised that Art He made a  Lyre  with Strings of  Silk  to banish all  Impurity  of Heart And in his Time the  Rites  and  Music  were in great  Perfection  Ib p  "  All this is evidently in the true Spirit of a peaceable Legisla∣tion  "CHINNONG a succeeding Emperor composed Songs on the  Fertility  of the Earth He made a beauti∣ful  Lyre  and a  Guitar  adorned with precious Stones which produced a noble Harmony curbed the Passions and elevated Man to  Virtue  and heavenly  Truth  Ib p  "  This is the same Character continued under a Period of higher Civilization The last Emperor whom I find to have retained the poetic or Musical Character was CHAOHAO who is said to have invented  "a new Species of Music to unite Men with superior Beings"  After him the  complex  Office seems to have  separated  And the first great  Bardlike  Character we meet with is CONFU∣CIUS who established  Music  and the  Rites  according to that Form which they still maintain in CHINA  DU HALDE  Hist Chinois  For here as in ancient EGYPT CRETE and SPARTA every thing is unalterably fixed by Law by which Means Improvement and Corruption are alike prevented  With Respect to the Extent of the  Progression  of Music in this vast Empire it appears that they have no musical Notation that Composition in  Parts  is altogether un∣known and that the whole  Choir  sings the  same  Melody That their Music is altogether of the  diatonic Kind  and even wretched to an  European  Ear  See Specimens of it in DU HALDE  Yet they boast of its wonderful Powers in former Times Whence some of the Historians seem to guess that it hath degenerated while in reality no other Consequence can be justly drawn but that either the People are less  ignorant  and  barbarous  or that Music is now less assiduously and powerfully  applied  or that certain  Separations  have en∣sued similar to those which took Place in ancient GREECE Any of which Causes must naturally destroy its Force  It appears however that the Progression had advanced so far in some former Period prior to CONFUCIUS as to produce  dramatic Representation  mixed with  Song  And  in Conformity to the Principles given above we find that as they regard not the  Unities  of Action Place or Time so neither is any  continued Choir  in use though there be manifest Remains of it in their  Plays  For at the Conclusion of Scenes or Acts as well as at other Times when a  pathetic  Circumstance occurs the Persons of the Play instead of  declaiming  begin to  sing  The  Prologue  resembles that uncouth one of GREECE that is he tells you  who  he is and  what  is his  Errand  All their Plays have a  moral  or  political  Direction suited to the Genius of the People and the State They know not the Difference between  Tragedy  and  Comedy  another Circumstance which confirms the Principle given above concerning the true Rise and Distinction of these two Kinds in GREECE For the  Chinese  as they have ever been of a  timid  and  peaceable  Cha∣racter so neither are they given to  Raillery  or  Sarcasm  but al∣together to  Civility  and mutual  Respect  Hence neither the  Tragic  nor  comic  Drama could probably arise so as to be marked as a  distinct Species  Accordingly their  Plays  are generally of an  intermediate  Cast between  Terror  and  Pity  on the one Hand  Sarcasm  or  Ridicule  on the other The "  little Orphan  of CHINA" indeed which is given as a Specimen by DU HALDE borders on the  tragic  Species But this Play is but one of a hundred most of which are of a different Cast and was selected by him because he thought it the best adapted in its Genius to the Spirit and Taste of the  Europeans  For he tells us expresly that the general Character of their Plays are altogether different from this that they are commonly of a  middle  Kind and neither  Tragedy  nor  Comedy  Another Circumstance of the Progression must be marked which  is that their  Actors  are a  separate  Rank from their  Poets  that they are formed into  Companies  and have lost their original Dignity of Office and Character  In the ancient Kingdom of PERU the Progression of  Music  had reached the same Period though somewhat different in its Circumstances GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA informs us that their fabulous Songs were in∣numerable that he had heard many and learnt some of them from his Ancestors who were the last of the royal Family of the INCAS They were of various Kinds founded on a Variety of Passion religious warlike and amorous They had invented a Kind of  unequal Pipe  formed of Reeds of different Lengths precisely the same with that of ancient GREECE They had also a Species of Flute with four or five Stops Their Music was simple like that of all unpolished Countries Their INCAS or  Chiefs  had been  Poets  or  Musicians  in the early Periods and the Author of the Commentaries gives a Poem com∣posed by one of them which bears all the Marks of a spirited and savage Original They had their  dramatic  Re∣presentations in Part  resembling  and in Part  differing  from those of the  Chinese  Their Manners and Character  brave  though not  ferocious  had naturally produced  Tragedy  though of a Kind rather  grand  than  terrible  See above Sect vi Art  But their  mild Temper  in Time of  Peace  little given to  Sarcasm  seems to have  prevented  the Birth of  Comedy  GARCI∣LASSO indeed divides their  Drama  into  Tragedy  and  Comedy  But this was manifestly the Effect of his own preconceived Opinions and arose from a Habit of con∣sidering all  dramatic  Composition as belonging to one  of these  Species  For he tells us that  "their  Tragedies  represented their military Exploits the  Triumphs Victories  and  heroic Actions  of their renowned Men And the Subject or Design of their Comedies was to demonstrate the Manner of good  Husbandry  in  culti∣vating  and manuring their  Fields  and to shew the Management of domestic Affairs with other familiar Matters"  A Circumstance which ought to give them the Title of  Bucolic  or  Georgic Drama  rather than that of  Comedy  For not a Word occurs concerning  Ridicule  or  Character  the  Union  of which two Circumstances may seem to constitute the  Essence  of  true Comedy  These Plays were  composed  by the  Amautas  or  Bards  whose Office was separated from that of the INCAS but still held in Honour as in other barbarous Polities But in another Respect the Progression was different from that in CHINA The  Actors  maintained the original Dignity which they had held in the early Periods For the  Lords  and  Officers  of the Court were the  Actors  and as soon as the Play was ended they took their  Places  according to their  Degrees  GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA  Comment Real  l ii c    To these we may add one Instance more concerning the natural Union and Progression of Music and Poetry An Instance less known yet more singular than any of these already given When the  Christian Missionaries  arrived on the Coast of  proper India  they found a Sect called the "  Christians of St  THOMAS" living in great Simplicity and Innocence and retaining many of the original Cus∣toms of their savage Forefathers  LA CROZE  Hist du Christ  p c  among others they  found these Christians as well as the Pagans of the Coun∣try possessed of rude  Music  and  Poetry  in their  natural Union  and  Power  They acquiesced in the Application of these Arts already made by the Christian Tribe and wisely laid hold of their Influence for the Conversion of the Pagan Natives Under these Circumstances the following Accounts will appear natural and probable on the Principles already delivered  First it appears that the general and Fundamental Practice of  singing  the  Praise  of  great Men  had been maintained from the most ancient Times In Consequence of this  "The Synode being ended the Partisans of the Union composed in the  Malabar  Tongue a long  Ode  or  Song  which contained the whole  History  of the  Portu∣guese Prelate  and a pompous Detail of what had passed at the Synod This Nation hath preserved the ancient Custom of consecrating to Posterity by this Kind of Poem all the most remarkable Events The Song was caught and immediately dispersed every where and during the Visits which the Prelate made the People sung it in his Presence which together with their  Dances  and  Music  made the chief Part of his Entertain∣ment  LA CROZE  Hist du Christ  p  When he went to ANGAMALE the Way was spread with Carpets And it was a fine Sight to see a  Child  of six Years old very beautiful and richly dressed who  sung  melodiously the whole  Song  we have spoken of as containing the  Labours  of the  Pre∣late  Ib p  "  The religious  Song  and  Dance  were no less remarkably and singularly maintained in a Kind of imperfect  Union  as they had been transfered from  Pagan  Objects to those of  Christianity  "In the same Place the  Christian Mala∣bars  to amuse the Archbishop gave him a  Ball  after the Manner of the Country It was of so singular a Nature that I am persuaded the Reader will not be displeased with the Description These  Dances  are generally practised at  Night  This begun at eight in the Evening and lasted till an Hour after Midnight None but the Men dance and their Modesty and Reserve are admirable Before the  Dance  begins they all make the  Sign  of the  Cross  and  sing  the  Lord's Prayer  which is followed by a  Hymn  in Honour of  St Thomas  Their other  Songs  rowl chiefly on the  illustrious Actions  of their  Forefathers  or the  Virtues  of their  Saints  In a Word this Entertainment has all the Air of  an Act of Devotion  on which the  Portuguese Historian  takes Occasion to inveigh against the  prophane Songs  of the  Europeans  which seem composed only to inspire  Debauch  and  Immodesty  LA CROZE  Hist du Christ  p  "  The Missionaries who have visited the opposite Coast of COROMANDEL give us Proof that the  Progression  of  Music  and  Poetry  had not stopped at this early Period but advanced to  theatrical Representation  which we shall see they were bold enough to apply even to the great Purpose of  Conversion  "In this Country they have an extreme Passion for the  Theatre  Good Poets are held in great  Veneration  among this People who are by no means of a barbarous Cast In INDIA Poetry enjoys the Favour of the Great They give its young Pro∣fessors the Honour of the  Palanquin  which is a very  high Distinction The  Theatre  which was prepared near our Church was of vast Extent Indeed I found not there the Rules of HORACE or BOILEAU put in Practice but was agreeably surprized to find the  Acts  distinguished and varied with  Interludes  or  Choirs  the Scenes well connected the Machines judiciously in∣vented Art in the Conduct of the Piece Taste in the Dresses Propriety in the  Dances  and a kind of  Music  harmonious though  irregular  and  wild  The  Actors  displayed great  Freedom  and  Dignity  in their Speech They were taken from one of the  Superior Orders  or  Castes  Their Memory was good and there were  no Prompters  That which edified me most was that the Piece began with an authentic Profession of Christianity And contained the keenest  Ridicule  and severest  In∣vectives  on the  Gods  of the Country Such are the  Christian Tragedies  which they oppose here to the  pro∣phane Tragedies  of the  Idolaters  Hence it appears that the  History  of their  Gods  made the Subject of their  native  theatrical Representations  and they are for this Reason an excellent Mean of Conversion  How far this was a proper Method of Conversion will be considered in the Work advertised at the End of this Dissertation  The Audience was composed of at least twenty thousand Souls who listened in profound SilenceThe Charac∣ter of their Theatre is that of a  lively  and  perpetual Action  and a strict Caution of  avoiding long Speeches  without proper  Breaks  Lettres Edifiantes Recueil  xviii p  "  Such is the State of  Melody  and  Song  in proper INDIA Some of its Appearances are singular and at first View may seem unnatural But after a mature Considera∣tion  of what hath been delivered on the Union Pro∣gression and Separation of these Arts in ancient GREECE 'tis presumed the sensible Reader will easily account for all these apparent Singularities  SECT X Of the natural Union and Progressions of Melody and Song amongst the ancient Hebrews  LET us now in Conclusion analyze the State of Me∣lody and Song among the ancient  Hebrews  The leading Singularity of this extraordinary People was their Rejection of Idolatry and their established Worship of the  one  GOD the  Creator  of the World As this Cir∣cumstance gave a peculiar Colour to their  Religion  so upon the Principles of this Dissertation it will follow that it must give a Peculiar Turn to their  Music  because we have seen that the Genius of the  original Music  of every Country depends on its  Religion  as its chief  Basis  In Consequence of this Principle their  Song  or  Poem  was chiefly dedicated to the  Celebration  of the  true  GOD the  Creator  of all things At other Times it is composed of  moral Exhortations  delivered as the Dictates of his Will or thrown out in prophetic Raptures concerning the great Intents of his ProvidenceHence the  Hymn Ode  or poetic  Rapture  which we have found to be naturally the first Form of Composition among all Na∣tions appeared with unrivaled Splendor in the  Hebrew  Poetry because its  Object  is so much  Superior  to that of other Nations The one being no more than the limited and narrow Power of supposed  local Gods  the other  the Omnipotence and Wisdom of an  eternal  and  universal Creator  Of this Distinction their  Bards  were fully sen∣sible  "As for the Gods of the Heathen they are but  Idols  but it is the  Lord  that  made  the  Heavens  "  The Book of Psalms the Lamentations the Songs of MOSES DAVID ISAIAH and other Prophets all written in Measure and sung by those who composed them are so many striking Instances of the true and unequaled Sublime  With Respect to the  Form  it may be observed that their  Songs  or  Hymns  are of that  mixed  Species which naturally ariseth first before any Separations take Place or produce the several Species of Composition Though the  hymnal  Form be chiefly  predominant  yet we find them frequently to be a Mixture of  Ode Narration  and  Dia∣logue  and thus they contain the Seeds or Principles of the three great succeeding Kinds of  unmixed Ode Epic  and  Tragedy  It may be regarded as an extraordinary Circumstance that this first  mixed  Form of Composition should have continued unchanged for a Period of at least a thousand Years and that from first to last it should never move forward so as to produce the  Epic  and  Dramatic  Species But on Examination it will appear that the same Cause the Worship of the one GOD which produced the highest Degree of Sublime in the  hymnal  Species naturally  checked  the Course of poetry among the JEWS and pre∣vented that  Progression  which we have found to arise from the natural State of Things in  Pagan  Countries  With Respect to the  Epic  Poem we have seen that in its first and original Conception and Formation it is no  other than  "A fabulous History rowling chiefly on the great Actions of the Gods and Heroes of the Nation and composed under certain Limitations with Respect to its Manner for the Ends of Pleasure Admiration and Instruction"  Hence the  true  GOD being the sole Object of the Adoration of the HEBREWS and their Re∣cords being the sacred Depositary of the  History  of his  Providence  the Truth of which it was deemed the highest Crime to violate the Invention and Construction of an  Epic Fable  could never be the Result of a natural and un∣taught Progression  If the  Epic  Form was thus naturally prevented by the Severity of Truth the first Form of  Tragedy  and  dramatic Exhibition  must of Course be checked from the same Principle For we have seen that the native and original tragic Species is but an Union of the Ode and Epic Fable animated by personal Representation To this we may subjoin that an additional Absurdity would here present itself The Absurdity of cloathing the  Deity  in a visible and  human Form  A Circumstance strictly forbidden by the  Jewish  Law  If it be said that although these Reasons are good against their introducing the  Deity  as the leading Subject either of  Epic  or  dramatic Fable  yet still their  Heroes  might have furnished Subjects for  Both  We may reply that all the great Actions of their Heroes were so inti∣mately connected with the important History of Provi∣dence which this People were destined both to  execute  and  preserve  that even  These  became improper Subjects for the Mixture and Alloy of Fable And farther The very Tendency of Fancy towards such a Progression of  Poetry was quenched  here  also in its first Conception For the first and original Enthusiasms of an untaught Tribe are awakened by the Belief that their deceased Heroes are advanced to the Rank of  Gods  and still main∣tain their former  Relation  and  Affection  to their native  Country  Hence the Imagination is kindled by Hope of their Favour and Assistance Hence Adoration riseth flattering Fables of their Power Prowess and Atchieve∣ments are invented and the Genius of  Epic  and  Tragic  Song is awakened into Action But where as among the JEWS their greatest Men are represented as what they were weak ignorant and mortal often humbled for their Sins always under the Controul of an overruling Providence and after Death lost to every earthly Con∣nexion here the first natural Enthusiasms of the Soul could meet with no Objects to excite them A Collision was wanting And the artless Mind instructed only in sacred Things returned of itself to the unmixed and in∣artificial Celebration of the  allwise  and  allpowerful  GOD  As from these Causes the Forms of their  Song  never had any Progression so it seems probable that their  Melody  stood still in the same Manner Its Application was chiefly to the Service of Religion and as their Hymn continued unchanged in its Genius we may reasonably believe that the Melody which accompanied it had the same Fate For though there was nothing particular ordained with Respect to Music in the  Mosaic  Law yet where almost every other Circumstance relative to Worship was particularly prescribed this Severity of In∣stitution would give a Kind of Sanctity to every ancient Custom that stood connected with it and hence their Modes of Melody would probably remain unchanged  CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS informs us that their Hymns were composed in the  Dorian  Mode  STROMAT l vi  Which what∣ever it was we know to have been one of the most  an∣cient  as well as  grave  and  sedate  and therefore fit for the Service of the TempleTheir Instruments were various but simple That which DAVID chiefly used appears to have been the  Nabla  or  Trigonon  a threecornered Instrument of the  Harp  Species Its Compass we know from his own Authority and that it was an Instrument of  ten Strings  We may be assured too that his Melody was not only simple but single For he must have held his Harp with one Hand and played with the other when he led the  religious Dance  before the Ark  As their  Song  and  Melody  so their  Dance  seems to have been chiefly employed in the Service of Religion The most frequent Exercise of this religious Rite devolved upon the Women It appears too that the Prophets had some Kind of  solemn Movements  suited to the State and Circumstances of their divine Enthusiasm This Branch of the triple musical Alliance seems as in other Countries to have made the earliest Separation It ap∣pears to have been chiefly exercised by the lower Ranks in the Time of DAVID And hence it was that MICHAL the Daughter of SAUL like a true fine Lady despised that Monarch for exercising a Mode of Piety which in her Days was  no longer fashionable  As to the united or complex Character of  Legislator  and  Bard  it is remarkable that this was preserved among the JEWS through a longer Succession of Ages than in any other Nation from the same Cause which prevented any  Progression or Change in the Forms of their Song For the musical Art being chiefly exercised in the Praises of the true GOD was in less Danger of being  corrupted  and therefore not only its  Utility  was longer  preserved  but likewise its  Professors  were in less Danger of being  debased  than in other Countries where trifling or immoral Ap∣plications of the Art ensued Consequently the Rulers of the People could have no Temptation to quit any Part of that Character or Office which still maintained its pristine Use and Dignity Accordingly we find that from MOSES down to SOLOMON during a Period of at least a thousand Years the  complex  Character of  Legislator  and  Bard  often appeared in the most distinguished Leaders of their State and from first to last remained unbroken MOSES their first great Lawgiver led the Song of Triumph on the Overthrow of the  Egyptians  in the  RedSea  EXODUS  MIRIAM a distinguished Prophetess led the female Dance and Choir on the same Occasion  Ibid  While the  Judges  ruled in ISRAEL this complex Office still remained DEBORAH is an Instance of this Truth She  judged  ISRAEL and sung her noble Song of Triumph on the Death of SISERA and JABIN We find that whoever was raised to the Station of a  Judge  or  Chief  was commonly invested not only with the  prophetic  but the  bardlike  Character For we know that the Prophets generally sung their pro∣phetic Raptures to the Harp  SAM x CHRON xxv  In Aftertimes when SAUL was elected  King  he too assumed at once the pro∣phetic and musical Office The Songs and bardlike Powers of DAVID his  kingly  Successor are too well known  to need an Illustration The same musical and poetic Character maintained its Union with that of  King  in his Son SOLOMON whose  Songs  we are told were no less than a  thousand and five  After him the  complex  Office of  Legislator  and  Bard  seems to have  separated  The peculiar Causes which had so long upheld it in the  Jewish  State now began to cease For  Idolatry  more and more pre∣vailed  Manners  became  corrupt  and public Misery and Ruin ensued The  Prophets  and  Bards  were now no lon∣ger found in the Courts of Kings or among the Rulers of the People Yet still they continued to throw out the Emanations of prophetic and moral Truth accompanied with the Enthusiasm of  Song  in the more retired and yet uncorrupt Situations of private Life And such were the  later Prophets  whose Writings still remain in Scrip∣ture  As this appears to be a true Analysis of the State of  Music  among the ancient HEBREWS it will now lead us to an easy Solution of a Fact which hath been regarded as mysterious by some of the Learned  "That while most other Nations had their  Bards  or  Poets  the JEWS though their Compositions are uncommonly sublime never had any  Poets by Profession  nor even a Word in their Language which denotes the Character  CALMET  Dissert sur la Poesie  c  "  The Principles here given afford a clear Solution of this Sin∣gularity Their  Prophets  were indeed their  Bards  and appear to have been invested with all the Dignity belong∣ing to that Office in its most honoured State But as the Almighty GOD and the great Events of his  Providence  were the continued  Object  of their  Songs  so the  poetic  or  musical  Character was but  secondary  to the  religious  Therefore the Name of  Bard  was swallowed up and lost in the higher Title of  "  The  PROPHET  of the  MOST HIGH"  SECT XI Of the State of Music and Poetry in ancient ROME  WE have now traced the Progress of  Melody  and  Song  through the most remarkable Periods of those various Nations in which their  Rise Union  and  Progress  was  native  and  original  Let us now view them in their more  weak borrowed  and  separate  State This Inquiry will bring us down to our own Times And here we must occasionally quit the ancient Names of  Melody  and  Song  and sometimes adopt those Titles which the two Arts now separate received in the later Ages of GREECE and which they have ever since retained among the polished Nations of EUROPE I mean those of MUSIC and POETRY  The first Flight which  Music  and  Poetry  took from GREECE was to ROME For in this imperial City they were not  native  The Causes of this original Defect together with the State and Progressions of these Arts at ROME on their Arrival from GREECE will make the Sub∣ject of this Section  The only Cause that hath been assigned for the Want of Music and Poetry among the  Romans  in the early Ages of the Republic hath been  "that their Attention to War and Conquest swallowed up all other Regards and  therefore Music and Poetry were of course neglected"  This Reasoning might hold if these Arts made no more than a mere  Amusement  in the  early  Ages as they gene∣rally do in the  later  Periods of a State But as it appears in the Course of this Dissertation that Melody and Song are the natural Produce of savage Life however warlike that the Continuance of this warlike Character tends ra∣ther to heighten than extinguish their Power and that the History of human Nature confirms this Truth We must therefore seek for this peculiar Defect in some other and more hidden Cause  There is a Principle which relates to the Establishment and Character of  Colonies  which will hereafter appear at∣tended with extensive Consequences and which will assist us in unfolding the true Foundation of this Defect  Melody Dance  and  Song  being the natural Effects of savage Manners continuing through several Ages it must follow that  Colonies  will in general be found to possess them in a very imperfect State Fox  Colonies  are seldom sent out till that early Period is past when the  Legislator's  and  Bard's  Character are  united  in the same Person Hence the  Leader  of the new Colony not being possessed of the poetic and musical Enthusiasm can neither have  Ability  nor  Inclination  to instil or propagate these Arts among his Followers Thus the first leading Flame of Enthusiasm is quenched And the inferior Ranks being busied in the Affairs of their new Settlement have not that Leisure which the unemployed savage State affords to turn their Attention on these natural Pleasures For Colonies of Men seldom depart from their native Country unless when driven by some Kind of  Necessity  And there∣fore  must betake themselves for Subsistance either to  Industry  or  War  The last of these was the chief Occu∣pation of the  Roman  State And thus not because they were a  warlike  People but because they were a  needy Colony  the  musical Arts  which were so  powerful  in  early  GREECE were so  weak  in  early  ROME  This Observation will hold true of most other Countries peopled by foreign Nations after a certain Period of Civi∣lization Thus CARTHAGE was a Colony which went out from TYRE And  Music  which was of Weight in the  native  City was of no Consideration in the  descendant  State Thus again the  Irish Welsh  and  Scots  are strictly  natives  and accordingly have a Music of  their own  The  English  on the contrary are a foreign Mixture of lateestablished Colonies and as a Consequence of this have  no native Music  He who would find the  original Music  of ENGLAND must seek it in WALES  Here then appears the true Cause of this Defect in the early Ages of ROME So ignorant were the  Trojan  Found∣ers of the Empire in the musical Arts that they had not even the first Rudiments of  Song  For we are told by a learned  Roman  that when ENEAS brought the Images of the Gods to Shore  "the  Women howled  and  danced  at the Solemnity  DIONYS  Halicarn  l i c  "  The History of the musical Arts in ROME confirms this general Principle Their Music and Poetry was always  borrowed  and  adopted  Let us trace its Progress through the several succeeding ages  NUMA POMPILIUS first introduced these Arts into the  Roman  religious Ceremonies Had he been a  Native  of ROME he had been a clear Exception to the Principle here given But instead of overturning he confirms it For he was a retired philosophic and illustrious  Sabine  And the  Salian  Priests which he established were  Musicians  or  Bards  who had been brought by EVANDER from ARCADIA into ITALY  DIONYS  Hal  l i  Thus the  Salian  Songs were not  native  but  transplanted  into ROME  We find no farther Progress in the musical and poetic Arts for many Ages Save only that a vague Rumour prevailed in the later Periods of the Commonwealth that in ancient Times it had been usual to sing the Praises of great Men at Feasts  CICERO  de Leg  l ii    The next Progression of the musical Arts in ROME was the  Adoption  of the  Thuscan Shews  These as LIVY in∣forms us were called in from ETRURIA during a fatal Pestilence with a View of appeasing the angry Gods  LIV  Hist  l vii  The borrowed Flame was soon caught and spread among the  Roman  Youth who by Degrees gave  Voice  to the  mute Action  of the  Thuscans  To these the  Atellane  Plays succeeded being in the same Manner  borrowed  and adopted by the  Roman  People from the OSCI a neighbouring Province Both these and the  Thuscan Shews  seem to have been  native  in their respective Districts and therefore we need go no farther in Quest of their true Origin than to the untaught Progression and Se∣paration of  Melody Dance  and  Song  But on their first  Entrance into ROME these dramatic shews were no longer in their  natural  but in an  ingrafted  State The first Idea then of  Comedy  was caught by  Adoption  in this Republic Here as in the Adoption of the  Salian Songs  they were mere  Imitators  And thus contrary to the natural Course of Things as we have proved above  Sect vii    Comedy  had by Accident an Establishment prior to  Tragedy  in ancient ROME  As it appears that in the first Periods of theatrical and dramatic Representation it is natural for the  Poet  to  act  a Part in his own Plays  Sect vi  so LIVIUS ANDRONICUS the first known dramatic Poet of ROME  Art  maintained this natural  Union  of the  Poet  and  Actor  which he had received from the adopted Shews But so little were theatrical Representations the Effect of Nature at ROME and so much were they received as mere Shews of  Pleasure  and  Amusement  that even at this early Period an unexampled  Separation  commenced a Separation more absurd than any that had taken Place in GREECE For now  "LIVIUS acting his own Play according to the Custom of the Times was compelled by the People to repeat some favourite Passages till his Voice grew hoarse On which he obtained Leave to substitute a Slave to  sing  the Poem along with the  Musician  while he himself performed the  Action  in dumb Shew  LIV  Hist  l vii  "  Thus an  absurd Separa∣tion  was established and continued so established through the succeeding Ages of the  Roman  Empire  LUCIAN  de Salt  Hence ROSCIUS himself of whom the World hath heard so  much was often no more than an Imitator by  mute  Action We may safely pronounce it impossible that this Separation could have come on unless the theatric Representations had already degenerated into a mere  Amusement  When a  slave  was permitted to  sing  the  Poem  we may be sure the chief Attention was turned on the  Gesticulation  of the  Actor  That which in a  sound  State of things had been  subordinate  was now become  principal  However the theatrical Shews in this Period seem to have had little Effect the Manners of the People con∣tinuing much the same with those of more ancient Times After the Succession of a few Ages the principal Pro∣gressions came on and these arose from their Acquaint∣ance with and their Conquest of GREECE  As this Event happened many Years after the musical Arts had lost their  Union  their proper  Ends  and original  Genius  in the  MotherCountry  so it was natural that the  Romans  now verging towards a Decline of Manners should greedily borrow and adopt them in that  separate imperfect  and  perverted  State which these Arts held when the  Greeks  were conquered by the  Romans  Let us there∣fore trace them from their first to their last Progressions in ROME where we shall find that from being of mere Amusement or little Utility they degenerated by Degrees into Things pernicious  In the early Periods of GREECE the Poet composed the Melody for his Plays In the Decline of the Greek States the Melody was the distinct Labour of another Person  See above Sect vi Art  This Separation the  Romans  maintained A Conduct  natural among those who considered these Arts as the In∣struments of Pleasure only The necessary Consequence of this was the gradual Introduction of an effeminate and luxuriant Melody of which both CICERO  De Leg  l ii  and HORACE  Epist ad Pis  in their respective Times complain  In Consequence of these a new and fatal Separation en∣sued The  Player  who in the uncorrupted Ages of GREECE was often of the  first Rank  in the Republic was generally of  slavish  Birth at  Rome  and was by Law ex∣cluded from the Freedom of the City  LIV  Hist  l xxiv    A whimsical Change was made in the Form of the  Masque  For in order to give a  Variety  of  Expression  which became necessary as the Fable of their Comedy grew more  complicated  the two Sides were marked with  different Pas∣sions  "The Father who is a principal Character in the Comedy as he is sometimes  pleased  and sometimes  angry  hath one of his Eyebrows even and the other  raised  aloft and the  Roman  Actors take Care to shew  that Side  of the  Masque  to the Audience which suits with his  present Temper  QUINTIL  Inst  l ii c  "  With Respect to the  Subjects  of their  Tragedy  they were here no less mere Imitators For although they had one Species in which their own Great Men were the  Heroes  of the Poem yet even this was not original but altogether built on the  Grecian  Model But farther we learn from HORACE that the most approved Subjects were those which were drawn from HOMER's Poems He gives this as a Rule to the Poets of his Time and  Country  "That to throw the Fables of the  Iliad  into tragic Scenes is a safer and better Practice than to at∣tempt Subjects yet untouched"  A Passage which con∣tains the clearest Proof that Tragedy was now separated from its highest Purposes and that the  great Ends  of this  Poem  which gave it so much  Power  in GREECE were utterly lost to the Roman People  The primary Applications of  Tragedy  being thus little known in ROME even on its first Admission we cannot wonder that it became a weak and languid Amusement Especially among a People whose Manners were now sinking into That Character which tended to give  Comedy  the Ascendant as in the declining Period of the  Greek  States Thus the true Cause appears why  Comedy  was cultivated so much more than  Tragedy  in every Period of this Republic  The  Ode  or  hymnal  Species seems to have been as ef∣fectually separated from the Ends of  Public Utility  as the  Tragic  Poem HORACE often declares his Inability to attempt any thing  Great  in this Kind The general Cha∣racter of his Odes corresponds much with his own Sen∣timent They are always elegant seldom majestic His  Irreligion  even  disqualified  him from excelling in the  highest Species  of the  Ode  For of this we have seen  Religion  must be the  Object  And although there be a variety of fine  moral  Apothegms and frequent Allusions to the  public State  of ROME yet these are always  checked  and made  subservient  to the Favour of MAECENAS and AUGUSTUS In a Word they are but  secondary Urbanity  of Senti∣ment  Elegance  of  Phrase  and of  Compliment  to his Mas∣ters were manifestly his  first Object  With Regard to the Character of the famed  Roman Epic  Poem notwithstanding the inordinate Praises that have been lavished on VIRGIL's  Aeneid  it may with Truth be affirmed that neither the  original  nor  legislative  Spirit of ancient GREECE appear with any uniform Splen∣dor through the Course of this celebrated Work Elegant in Diction a Master in Rythm and Numbers nervous in Figures majestic in Description pathetic in tragic Inci∣dents strong in the Delineation of Character accom∣plished in all the  secondary Qualities  of an  Epic Poet  yet still VIRGIL wanted that allcomprehensive Genius which alone can conceive and strike out a great original Epic Plan no less than that independent Greatness of Soul which was quenched by the  ruinous Policy  of the Times and which alone can animate true Genius to a full Exertion of its Powers in the Cause of  public Virtue  and  Mankind  Through the first of these Defects the  Aeneid  abounds with Inci∣dents that are borrowed unconnected broken and illplaced through the second though here and there the Spirit of  general Legislation  appears yet the great Subjects  peculiarly relative  to the  Roman  State the  Glories  of the  Republic  the  Atchievements  of its  Heroes  all these are cast into  Shades  and seen as through a  Veil  while the  strongest Lights  and  highest Colourings  of his Pencil are  prostituted  to the  Vanity  of the  ruling Tyrant  As both the  Ode  and  Epic  had thus degenerated from their original Character in GREECE so we shall find that the  Recitation  of them kept Pace with this spurious Birth We have already seen that in the more early Periods of the  Greek  Republics their Poems were  sung  to the sur∣rounding Audience for the important Ends of  Religion  Morals  and  Polity  In ROME as in the later Periods of GREECE we find the  Song  brought down to  Recitation  and these  great Purposes  swallowed up and lost in the  Vanity  and  SelfImportance  of the  Poet  Hence we find their best Writers declaring their Dislike to the Practice of  public Recitation  because Flattery was now become the Food of every reciting Poetaster The whole Farce and Foppery of this Practice which was indeed no other than the spurious Issue of the old  Grecian SongFeast  is given at large by VOSSIUS to whom for Brevity's Sake we refer  De Imitatione  c c    The musical Arts being thus  separated  and  perverted  from their  proper Ends  no Wonder that we hear so little of their being applied to the  Education  of  Youth  in any Period of ancient ROME  On the contrary as Manners and Principles grew more profligate along with the inordinate growing Power and Luxuries of the Empire so the Genius of the  poetic  and  musical  Arts kept Pace with them  Poem  which in the Days of ancient GREECE had been the  Handmaid  of  Vir∣tue  was now declared to be the  Bawd  of  Licentiousness  and to write  immodest  Verses was held a  blameless  Prac∣tice  Castum decet esse Poetam Ipsos Versiculos nihil necesse est  Thus the Art sunk so low that the Name of  Poet  was held unworthy a Man of  Age  or  Dignity  Turpe est Senem Versus scribere  The  mimetic  and  musical  Arts grew not only an intolerable Burthen but became at length of most pernicious In∣fluence on the State The Attention to the  mimetic  Art was now carried to a most ridiculous Extreme CICERO informs us that the Players practised several Years before  they ventured upon the Stage  CIC  de Oratore  l i  That the Actors in Imitation of the degenerate  Greeks  gradually awakened their Powers of Speech in the Morning lest by too sudden an Exertion they should endanger the Voice  Ibid  They gargled the Throat with a Composition proper for the Purpose And the Methods of managing and improving the Voice were now formed into a separate Science  PERSIUS  Sat  I  In a Word LIVY complains that  "an Amusement which was harmless in its Beginnings had now grown to such a Madness of Expence that the wealthiest Kingdoms were hardly equal to it  L vii  "  In the later Periods the Mischief grew still more intolerable For now the serious Arts were cultivated by Few Nothing was heard but light and effeminate Music The Singer took the Philosopher's Place the Libraries were shut up and the general Attention was turned upon musical Instruments proper to accompany and sustain the Gesticulation of the Actors The Effects of this Dissolute Taste soon appeared For QUINTILIAN tells us that  "the effeminate and immodest Music of the Stage had no inconsiderable Part in destroying that small Degree of manly Character which had been left among them  Inst  l i  "  The Evil still increased So that in the Time of NERO  "The City swarmed with  Pantomimes  Every private House now became a Theatre and the Husband and Wife contended which should most successfully  pro∣stitute  themselves to the  Favour  of the  Actors  SENECA  Nat Quaest  l vii  "  There is a Time when Nature struggles hard to free herself from peccant and deadly Humours This Time was now come at ROME but it came too late The Body politic was expiring and was not able to shake off the Evil The Pantomimes were twice expelled but still returned again  TAC  An  l xiii xiv  At length the barbarous Nations of the North broke in upon the dying Empire TOTILA attacked and pillaged ROME The degenerate Arts sunk with the degenerate City And the Patrician Ladies who lately had reveled amidst the Spoils of a subjected World now begged before their own Doors  The extravagant Passion of some of their later Emperors for the musical Arts and these too of the most debauched and profligate Characters particularly CALIGULA and NERO is too well known to need a Delineation This Essay is not intended as a  History  of  Facts  but an  Investi∣gation  of the  Causes  that produced them On this Subject therefore there is one Circumstance which may demand our attention We have seen above that the first original Legislators turned their Attention strongly on the musical Arts and we now find that the abandoned Rulers of a decaying Empire adopt them with no less Eagerness Doth not this Contrariety of Facts seem to shake some of the Principles which we have attempted to establish So far from this that it confirms them For in both In∣stances  Music  was made  subservient  to the  Views  or ruling  Passions  of those who  led  the People The honest Legis∣lators of early Times employed it for the Ends of public Utility the profligate Emperors abused it to the Purposes  of Licentiousness Among the former by a legitimate Use it became the Instrument of establishing Commonwealths Among the latter by a perverted Application it shook the Foundations of Empire ORPHEUS drew the barbarous Tribes from Theft Adultery and Murder by his Songs and Lyre NERO plundered his Patricians of their Estates to load his Musicians with Wealth and amidst the forced Acclamations of a corrupted Theatre violated a vestal Virgin on the Stage  SECT XII Of the State and Separation of Music and Poetry among the polished Nations of EUROPE through the succeeding Ages  THUS the musical and poetic Arts sunk along with the  Roman  EmpireBut Mankind emerging from the Ruins of  Luxury Profligacy  and  Invasion  are of a different Character from that of human Nature arising from mere  Barbarity  into  Civilization  We have traced the natural Progress of these Arts in the  last  of these but from the former nothing consistent or steady can arise The Views Manners Principles and Passions of a furious Conqueror meeting and mixing with those of a subdued and abandoned People produce such a Com∣pound of dissimilar and contending Causes as approach in their Effects to the Appearance of mere Chance or Fortune  But the Circumstance most worth remarking is this that in such a Period all the natural Seeds and Principles of the musical Arts are lost The whole  local  Fabric of  Religion Polity  and  Morals  is commonly sunk in the general Ruin and a barbarous Conqueror followed by an enraged Soldiery who have left their own Country to invade another have generally the  Vices  of  Savages  with∣out their  Virtues  Hence the  musical  Arts could not arise from the Ruins of the  Roman  Empire but from the ineffectual Principle of  mere Imitation  They wanted that  native  Force and Vigour which had given them so free and full a Growth in ancient GREECE  Such therefore being the Birth of the  modern Poetry  and  Music  of EUROPE having been the casual Offspring of the corrupted  Roman  Arts which were themselves no more than partial Imitations of the  Greek  in their State of Separation and Weakness no Wonder if the  modern Transcript  be  inferior  not only to the  Original  but the  first Copy  This general Principle being given we might perhaps end our Inquiry here Leaving the more particular In∣vestigation to the good Sense and Judgment of Mankind But to give all possible Satisfaction on a Subject which may by some be regarded as a Matter of Curiosity we shall trace the Rise and Progress of these Arts in their chief Appearances so far as they have Relation to each other  Before the Roman Empire fell to Ruin its Rulers took Care to the utmost of their Power to extirpate the native Music of the barbarous Countries which they conquered Of this JULIUS CAESAR AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS and SUETONIUS inform us This was a high Stroke of Policy For their native Songs being as in ancient GREECE the Repository of their Religious and Political  System nothing could so effectually  subdue  the  Minds  of these Barbarians as the Banishment or Destruction of their  Bards  and  Druids  We have already seen Edward the First of ENGLAND acting the same Tragedy in WALES on the same Principle  On the Revival of Learning the three greater Kinds of  Poetry  were in many Instances necessarily  divorced  from  Music  For the  Greek  and  Roman  Poets being the only approved  Models  could be read and imitated by  Scholars only  Thus the  Art  which in ancient GREECE had been the genuine Effect of natural Enthusiasm and aided by a native and correspondent Melody had been delivered to the People by the inraptured Bard could now be studied and attained only by the  sequestered Few  who were swal∣lowed up by a literary Application often ignorant of the Powers of Music and little acquainted with Society and MankindHence the  Epic Poet  the Manners of the Times likewise forbidding  See below Sect xiii  could no longer appear at the Place of public Concourse with his Lyre and festal Robes to charm the listening Audience with his legislative Songs but retired to the  Closet  and with a more com∣posed Mien delivered his Inspirations in written Verse for the Pleasure Admiration and Instruction of MankindThis might have been indured Because some of the general Ends of that calmer Species may be obtained by a  Homeapplication  But the Misfortune was that even  Tragedy  and  Ode  whose End is to shake the Soul with Terror Pity or Joy by a  theatrical Exhibition  It hath become a favourite Topic among certain Persons to decry the theatrical Exhibition of Tragedy as an Object below the Ambition of a Poet Whether any fastidious tragic Muse hath  privately  knocked at the Door of the Theatre and been  refused Admittance  we shall not here  affirm  But it belongs to our Subject to shew on what Foundation the theatrical Exhibition makes an essential Part of Tragedy and that with∣out it the tragic Poem is an  imperfect Species  The Epic Poem not only imitates Actions Sentiments Characters and Passions but likewise delineates their chief external and attendant Cir∣cumstances of Place Person Voice Countenance Attitude and Gesture And hence a full and perfect Imitation ensues In the Dramatic or Tragic Poem little of this latter Kind can be admitted without violating the Probability and Power of the Dialogue On this Foundation the Description of these external and attendant Circumstances is necessarily left to the Conduct of the  Actor  who in these Articles assumes the Pro∣vince of the Poet and is a real  Imitator  Hence a dramatic Poem  written  but  not represented  is capitally defective in the great Article of  Imitation  and is therefore a Species  essentially imperfect  ARISTOTLE hath over∣looked this capital Distinction between the Epic and Tragic Poem in his Comparison of these two Species  Poet  c xxvi  and the  Powers  of  Music  even these in many Instances and in different Periods were  divorced  from their  Assistant Arts  and became the  languid Amusement  of the  Closet  For be∣ing often written by retired and speculative Men unac∣quainted with the Workings of the human Soul and at∣tending only to the  external Form  and  poetic Ornaments  of the  Greek Drama  their Vanity hath been either to  soar  or  dive  into  Obscurity  to substitute mere  Imagery  in the Place of  Passion  to plan and write in a  cold  Style so far removed from Nature as to be incapable of a  living Re∣presentation  in a Word to compose  Tragedies  that cannot be  acted  and  Odes  that cannot be  sung  This false Taste in  Odewriting  hath so strongly esta∣blished itself in ENGLAND that an  Ode  of the  true  Cha∣racter is stiled by Way of Distinction An Ode for  Music  Of this Kind we have two noble ones in our Language  by DRYDEN and POPE But these will be considered more at large below  As the modern Poetry thus became often unfit for Music so from a singular Cause the Separation was con∣firmed and Music in its Turn became often unfit for Poe∣try After many Centuries had passed in Darkness GUIDO arose And with a Force of Genius surpassing that of all his Predecessors invented the Art of  Counter∣point  or  Composition  in  Parts  Yet this very Circumstance which seemed to promise so noble an Improvement in Music was a strong concurrent Cause of compleating its Divorce from Poetry For now  instrumental  Music having assumed a new and more inviting Form and be∣ing ennobled by the principles of a complex and varied  Harmony  was introduced as being of itself a  compleat  Species independent of Poetry or Song This gave it an  artificial  and  laboured  Turn while the Composer went in Quest of curious Harmonies Discords Resolutions Fugues and Canons and prided himself like the Poet in a pompous Display of Art to the Neglect of  Expression  and true  Pathos  And thus modern Music on its first Rise was in a Manner divorced from  Poetry Legislation  and  Morals  These Causes sufficiently account for the present State of the two Sister Arts in every Instance of their  total Separation  Let us now consider them in those Situations where their Union is indeed in some Sort maintained but this in an improper and ineffectual Manner  The four distinct Forms in which these two Arts still maintain an imperfect Union are The common  Song  or  Canzonette  The  Opera  or  Drama  for the  Stage  The  Anthem  or  Motet  for the  Church  The  Ora∣torio  or  sacred Drama  The common  Song  or  Canzonette  hath sunk from the original Dignity which it maintained in ancient GREECE from two evident Causes First The Separation of Music and Poetry from their important Ends and from each other naturally prevented the modern Poets and Musicians from considering this Species as being much worthy of their Attention Secondly The nobler Applications of the  Song  being thus relinquished and lost no Wonder if Men of high Station and moral Dignity disdained the Practice of it even where they had Ability as being an Object unworthy of their Regard Hence it hath come to pass that this Species is hardly supposed to touch on any Subject religious political or moral unless it be in Jest  There are some Exceptions to this general Observation but they take Place chiefly among the  Vulgar  among whom the  BalladSong  com∣monly retains its  moral  and  political  Applications  And thus the reigning Topics of the  Song  are generally  Love  and  Wine  The  French  and  English  have adopted both these Subjects The  Chansons à boire  of the former and the  drinking Catches  of the latter are Proofs of their Jollity rather than Taste Yet they clearly display the different Characters of the two Nations A parallel Remark might perhaps be made on their  LoveSongs  With this Exception however that in a Song of this Kind PURCEL hath left us one of the finest and best va∣ried Pieces of musical Expression that ever was com∣posed  From rosy Bowers  c  And in Justice to the present Times it must be farther observed that in ENGLAND this Species is  now in a good Degree rescued from its former Indelicacy The  Italians  and  Scots  have chiefly turned the  Song  on the Subject of  Love  With Respect to the  Poetry  the  Italian Canzonettes  are more elegantly written than the  Scotch  though with less Nature and Passion In the  Music  of the  Italian Canzonettes  there is little Variety They soon disgust by their Sameness of Expression The  Scotch Airs  are perhaps the truest Model of artless and pathetic musical Expression that can be found in the whole Compass of the Art Some of them are said to have been the Composition of DAVID RIZZIO who is sup∣posed to have ingrafted the  Italian  Regularity and Elegance of Song on the original wild and pathetic Manner of the  Scots  This Tradition carries the Appearance of Truth For the  Scotch  Airs are of two different Kinds easily distin∣guishable from each other The one  regular  and subject to the Rules of Counterpoint The other wild and desultory and such as do not easily receive the Accompanyment of a Bass The first of these may seem to have been the Com∣position or Reform of RIZZIO but in Force of Ex∣pression and Pathos the latter generally excel them A Circumstance which proves how little the Rules of mo∣dern Counterpoint have to do with the  Powers  of  Music  The State of the  Opera  will deserve a more particular Elucidation And to this End we must endeavour to trace it to its Origin which lies in great Measure hid in Darkness RICCOBONI is of Opinion that the first ever represented was that which the  Doge  and  Senate  of VENICE exhibited for the Entertainment of HENRY the third of FRANCE in the Year  Theat  c  But this Ac∣count  is by no means satisfactory For SULPITIUS an Italian speaks of the  musical Drama  as an Entertainment known in ITALY in the Year  MENETRIER  de Representations en Musique    History traces the Rise of the  Opera  no farther But a Circumstance mentioned by SULPITIUS who was a Man of Letters may seem to lead us up to its true Origin He is by some supposed to have been the Inventor of this  musical Drama  but he ingenuously tells us himself that he only  revived  it  Ibid  We have seen above that the  Tragedy  of the ancient  Greeks  was accompanied with Music that the same Union was borrowed and main∣tained through the several Periods of the  Roman  Empire If therefore we suppose what is altogether probable that the Form of the ancient Tragedy had been still kept up in some retired Part of ITALY which the Barbarians never conquered we then obtain a fair Account of the Rise of the modern  Opera  which hath so much con∣founded all Inquiry  As VENICE was the Place where the  Opera  first appeared in Splendor so it is highly probable that  there  the  an∣cient Tragedy  had slept in Obscurity during the Darkness of the Barbarous Ages For while the rest of ITALY was overrun by the Nations from the North the Seas and Morasses of VENICE preserved  Her  alone from their In∣cursions Hence History tells us the People flocked to VENICE from every Part of ITALY Hence the very Form of her Republic hath been maintained for thirteen hundred Years And from these Views of  Security  it was natural for the helpless Arts to seek an Asylum within  her Canals from the Fury and Ignorance of a barbarous Conqueror  Other Circumstances concur to strengthen this Opinion The  Carnaval  first appeared in Splendor and still wears it at VENICE beyond every other Part of ITALY Now the  Carnaval  is in many Circumstances almost a Transcript of the ancient  Saturnalia  of ROME  In the  Venetian Comedy  the  Actor  wears a  Masque  A palpable  Imitation  or rather  Continuance  of the old  Roman  Custom  That the modern  Opera  is no more than a Revival of the old  Roman Tragedy  and not a newinvented Species will appear still more evident if we consider that it is an Exhi∣bition altogether out of Nature and repugnant to the universal Genius of Modern Customs and Manners We have seen the natural Union of Poetry and Music as they rise in the savage State and how this Union forms the tragic Species in the natural Progression of Things Hence we have deduced the musical Tragedies of ancient GREECE But in ancient ROME it appears they arose merely from  Imitation  and  Adoption  Nor could it be otherwise because the  Romans  wanted the first seeds or Principles from whence the musical Tragedies of the  Greeks  arose The same Reasoning takes Place with Respect to the modern  Opera  It emerged at a Time when the general State of Manners in EUROPE could not naturally produce it Had it been the Result from  Nature  its Production would have been more  general  It emerged in that very City where most probably it must have lain hid In a City whose other Entertainments are evidently borrowed from those of ancient ROME And if to these  Arguments we add this farther Consideration that the Subjects of the very first  Operas  were drawn from the Fables of ancient GREECE and ROME  The Subjects of the first  Operas  were APOLLO and DAPHNE ORPHEUS and EURIDICE ALCESTES and ATYS which last in the Title Page of the oldest extant Edition is called  a musical Tragedy  and not from the Events or Atchievements of the Times and farther that in their  Form  they were exact Copies of the  ancient Drama  these accumulated Proofs amount to near a De∣monstration that the  Italian Opera  is but the  Revival  of the old  Roman Tragedy  As these Circumstances prove that the  modern Opera  is a  Revival  of the  old Roman Tragedy  so we are led from hence to a probable Con∣jecture concerning the  measured Recitation  of the  Roman Tragedians  And that it was something of the Nature of modern  Recitative    Such being the  Birth  of the modern  Opera  no Wonder it inherits the  Weakness  of its  Parent  For we have seen that the  Roman Tragedy  never had its proper Effects considered in a  legislative  View having been separated from its important Ends before its Arrival from GREECE As therefore it had declined into a mere  Amusement  when it was first adopted by ROME and as we have seen that in Proportion as the Roman Manners grew more dissolute Tragedy sunk still lower in its Character till at length it became no more than a Kind of mere  Substratum  or  Groundwork  on which the Actors displayed their Abilities in  Singing  and  Gesticulation  it was altogether natural that it should rise again in the same unnerved and effemi∣nate Form  From these Causes therefore we may trace all the Features of the modern  Opera  however  unnatural  and  distorted  they may appear The  Poem  the  Music  and the  Performance  as they now exist in  Union  are the manifest Effects of this spurious Origin  First That the  Subject  of the  Poem  should even on its first Appearance be drawn from Times and Countries little interesting and  Gods  and  Wonders  and  celestial Machinery  introduced which neither the Poet nor his Audience  believed  in could only be the Effect of a  blind  Principle of  Imitation  tending to mere  Amusement  The established Separation of the Poet's from the Musician's Art was pro∣ductive of parallel Effects For the Poet ambitious only of shining in his particular Sphere became generally more Intent on Imagery than Pathos Or else instead of being  principal  he became  subservient  to the Composer's Views from whence arose a Motley kind of Poem calcu∣lated only for a Display of the Musician's Art which degenerated by Degrees into a mere  Pasticio  Secondly the same Causes account for all the Ab∣surdities of the  Music  The  Recitative  or perpetual mu∣sical Accompanyment in the declamotary Parts is a Practice so much at Variance with modern Manners that it extorted the following Censure from a candid Critic  "I beg Pardon of the Inventors of the  mu∣sical Tragedy  a Kind of Poem as  ridiculous  as it is  new  ""If there be any thing in the World that is at Variance with  tragic Action  it is  Song  " "The  Opera  is the  Grotesque  of Poetry and so much the more in∣tolerable as it pretends to pass for a regular Work  DACIER  Rem sur Aristote  p  "  Now if along with DACIER we regard the  Opera  as a modern  Invention  this Circumstance of the perpetual musical Accompanyment is indeed  unaccountable  But if we regard it as a mere  Imitation  or  Continuance  of the old  Roman Tragedy  and trace  this  upwards to its true Foun∣tain the  Greek Drama  and again follow  this  to its original Source the  savage SongFeast  we then see how naturally these  extremes unite  and discern the rude  Melody  and  Song  of the  barbarous Greek  Tribes gradually melted into the  Refinements  of the  modern Opera  Again as the Sepa∣ration of the Poet's from the Musician's Art produced an  improper Poetry  so the Separation of the Musician's from the Poet's Character was productive of improper and  unaf∣fecting Music  For the Composer in his Turn intent only on  shining  commonly wanders into unmeaning Division and adopts either a delicate and refined or a merely popular Music to the Neglect of true musical Expression Hence too the  Da Capo  had its natural Origin A Practice which tends only to tire and disgust the Hearer if he comes with an Intent of being  affected  by the  tragic Action  or with any other View than that of  listening  to a  Song  The  Da Capo  which is so striking an Absurdity in the more modern Operas was not used in those of older Date Even COLONNA who lived about the middle of the sixteenth Century employed it not as appears by one of his Operas performed at the Academy in BOLOGNA A D But in an Opera of  Old  SCARLATTI intitled  La Teodora  composed in the  Da Capo  is found though not in all his Songs After that Period the Use of it seems to have become  general  For in an Opera of GASPARINI intitled  Il Tartaro nella China  composed in the  Da Capo  is found in every Song    Thirdly with Regard to the  Performance  of the  Opera  The theatrical Representation is of a Piece with the Poetry and Music For having been regarded from its first Rise more as an Affair of astonishing Shew than of affecting Re∣semblance it is gaudy flaunting and unnatural The Sing∣ers like the  Poet  and  Musician  being considered merely as  Objects of Amusement no Wonder if their Ambition seldom reacheth higher than to the Display of an artificial ExecutionAs a Consequence of these Principles the  Castrati  were introduced into all Sorts of Characters in spite of Nature and Probability and still continue to represent Heroes and Statesmen Warriours and WomenThe flourished Close or Cadence arose naturally from the same Sources From a total Neglect of the Subject and Expression and an Attention to the mere Circumstance of Execution onlyThe frequent  Encore  or Demand of the repeated Performance of particular Songs was the natural Effect of the same Causes No Audience demands the  Repetition  of a pathetic Speech in  Tragedy  though per∣formed in the finest Manner because their Attention is turned on the Subject of the Drama Thus if the Au∣dience were  warmed  by the  Subject  of an  Opera  and  took Part  in the main  Action  of the Poem the  Encore  instead of being  desireable  would generally  disgust  But the whole being considered as a mere  musical Entertainment  and the tragic  Action  commonly  forgot  the artificial Performance of a  Song  became naturally a chief Object of Admiration and the Repetition of it a chief  Object  of Request  Thus the whole Farrago of the  modern Opera  seems resolved into its clear and evident Principles And hence the  Subject  the  Music  the  Action  the  Dress  the  Execution Decorations  and  Machinery  are such a glar∣ing Compound of trifling and absurd  Improbabilities  that the  tragic Influence  is  overlaid  and  lost  nor is it possi∣ble for any impartial and rational Spectator to take Part in the dramatic Action or be  moved  by the  illfeigned Distress  Let not the Writer be thought to derogate from the Ability or Merit of all the  Poets Musicians  and  Singers  who devote their Labours to the  Opera  He knows there are Exceptions in each of these Departments  Some of METASTASIO's and QUINAULT's Operas are fine Tra∣gedies in three Acts  Neither let him be supposed to censure the  Opera  as an Enter∣tainment unworthy all Attention considered as a mere Amusement On the contrary whoever is inclined to hear a Succession of  Symphonies  and  Songs  set off with all the Decorations that can dazzle the Eye and all the Refinement of Execution that can inchant the Ear let him attend the  Opera  and he will find his Taste highly gratified But this Inquiry aims at a far more im∣portant Purpose Its Intention is to point out the Union the  Powers  and  primary Ends  of  Poetry  and  Music  And when the modern  Opera  is viewed in this Light the Writer presumes its Defects are too conspicuous to admit a Vindication  'Tis said indeed that the Weakness and Impropriety of this Entertainment is chiefly found in foreign Countries where the  Italian  Poetry and Music are not  native  but that in ITALY its Power and Influence are considerable This the sensible ROUSSEAU affirms in his Dissertation on the  French  and  Italian  Music But particular and well attested Facts are stubborn Things and will not bend to general Affirmations And of this Fact the concurrent Testimony of all observant Travellers assures us That in the  Italian  Theatre the Seats of the chief Hearers resem∣ble so many separate Apartments where the Nobility sit retired conversing on indifferent Subjects and regardless of the Progress of the Drama till some celebrated Singer  comes upon the Stage and then and then only ensues a Burst of  Rapture  of  Bravo's Encores  and  Applause  The Passion therefore thus expressed on this Occasion is evidently the Effect not of a true  Feeling  of the  Subject  or tragic  Action  which is entirely  disregarded  but as in the later Periods of ancient ROME of an  extravagant Admiration  of the  Singer's Ability  and  Art  The modern State of the  Anthem Motet  or  Hymn  comes next under ConsiderationWith Respect to the sacred Poetry that hath ever been used in the  Christian Church  it is various in different Countries It appears that in ITALY it hath been an allowed Custom from the earliest Ages to permit the Admission of  Hymns  or  Motets  as a Part of divine Service This Practice in Course of Time produced wild and incoherent Compositions For the poetic Character being separated from the musical the  Composers  little skilled in the Art of Poetry and yet considering themselves as  Principals  have often formed their Motets of Sentiments and Passions  inconsistent  with each other  For an Instance of this Kind take the following which is one of CARISSIMI's most celebrated  Motets  "Peccavi Domine miserere mei te diligit Anima mea te semper quaesivit Cor meum Ergo mi Jesu mi Creator mi Salvator dimitte Culpas parce Peccatis meis" c  Another Separation here too ensued I mean the total Separation of  Sense  from  Sound  For these Motets are generally composed in the  Latin  Tongue and therefore  unintelligible  to the greatest Part of those who  hear  them  As to the Church Music of ITALY and its once appendant Provinces it hath assumed a Variety of Shapes and in different Times hath undergone great Changes In the second Century it appears that the pagan Melody was  adopted and allowed under certain Restrictions of Modesty and Decorum  JUST MART  Quaest    It was afterwards established at CON∣STANTINOPLE by CONSTANTINE then at ALEXAN∣DRIA by ATHANASIUS This Establishment was found to have bad Effects through the effeminate Genius of the Music then in Vogue and was therefore banished from the Church of ALEXANDRIA No Wonder if it was infected with the Genius of the pagan Music of the Times which we find to have been dissolute and ener∣vate  See above Sect xi  From the general Prevalence of this debauched Taste AUGUSTINE was tempted to banish Music from the Church But AMBROSE reformed the Office of the Church of MILAN and established a Melody austere in the Extreme This was improved by GREGORY whose Melody succeeded and was established in the following Century And now the Devastations of the Barbarians coming on this  Plain Song  naturally lay hid unchanged in the Christian Church during the succeeding Ages of Ignorance and Cruelty  On the faint Revival of Arts in the eleventh Century the Appearance of GUIDO gave a new Genius to the Music of the  Roman  Church For according to the natural Tendency of his Invention of the Art of  Counterpoint  GASSENDI tells us that all the World now run mad after an artificial Variety of Parts About four hundred Years after GUIDO the debauched Art once more passed over into ITALY from GREECE Certain  Greeks  who escaped from the taking of CONSTANTINOPLE brought a refined and enervate species of Music to ROME Where meeting with a congenial Effeminacy under the gay and dissolute  Pontificate of the Princes of the House of MEDICI it ran into such an Extreme of Indecorum that  Pope  PIUS the  Fourth  formed a Resolution to expel it from the Church PALAESTRINI had the Art and Address to divert this im∣pending Storm by composing some Pieces of such a majestic Gravity as convinced the  Pope  that Music thus truly sacred might be made subservient to the noblest Pur∣poses This Severity of Composition still remains in the  Pope's Chapel  where ever since the Reform last men∣tioned even musical Instruments are not admitted for fear of creating new Abuses But the common Genius of their modern Church Music or Motets is altogether dif∣ferent It is infected with the same Puerility of Stile with their Opera Airs An unbounded Compass extrava∣gant Divisions on single Syllables a Play upon particular Words to the Neglect of the general Tenor of the Song form its general Character How can it be otherwise When the same Musicians and these seldom much in∣terested in the Subject or acquainted with the Language of their sacred Poetry generally compose both for the  Opera  and the  Church  Some noble Exceptions however may be found to this general Remark Of these CARIS∣SIMI is one But the most eminent Instance is in BENEDETTO MARCELLO a noble  Venetian  many of whose Psalms if we consider their Expression either as sublime tender graceful or joyous clearly excel the vocal Compositions of all his Countrymen in Variety Sim∣plicity and Truth  It must be observed that MARCELLO's Compositions are not set to the  Latin Translation  but to an  Italian Paraphrase  of the Psalms    With Respect to the  Performance  of their Church Music in ITALY it hath naturally too much followed the Genius  of the Art itself They have no established Choirs of Priests The  Castrati  are the chief Singers in the Church In ROME these Performers go round the City in Bands as they are accidentally hired and bring no great Credit to the sacred Music either by their Cha∣racters or personal Appearance The Truth is Church Music in ITALY like that of the  Opera  is considered more as a Matter of Amusement than Devotion Hence the Decorations and musical Exhibitions of their  Churches  in the Time of  Carnaval  approach towards those of the  Theatre  at an  Opera  And the general Attention is so far from being turned on sacred Subjects that it is chiefly exercised in  Debates  and  Quarrels  about the  Excellence  and  Superiority  of the performing  Castrati  Such then have been the  Separations  and  Progressions  of  sacred Poetry  and  Music  in the  Mother  Country from whence they have been chiefly derived and transmitted to the rest of EUROPE However as they wear an Aspect somewhat different in FRANCE and ENGLAND it may be proper to point out the chief Variations together with the Causes that have produced them  In FRANCE the sacred Poetry of their  Motets  or  Hymns  is in its general Turn much superior to that of ITALY For in FRANCE it is most commonly selected and borrowed if not transcribed from the  sacred Writings  This insures to it a considerable Degree of Propriety Dignity and Force How this came to pass we may learn from an Authority no less than that of the great COLBERT who in his political Testament acknowledges this among other Obli∣gations which the Church of FRANCE hath owed to their Intercourse with the  Protestants  that it hath given them a  more general and intimate Acquaintance with the holy ScripturesTheir sacred Music though not possessed of that Grace which the best Italian may truly boast yet it may be justly regarded as the best that FRANCE hath pro∣duced because it is set to a much better musical Language than their own For the  Latin  Tongue hath a Variety of Accent and Measure which adapts itself happily to musical Expression whereas the  French  Language is hoarse illaccented or of ambiguous Accent void of Har∣mony and Variety and incurably discordant But still the Composition of their  Motets  in the  Latin  Tongue is at∣tended with the same absurd Consequence as in ITALY that the People in general do not understand themIn one Respect however their sacred Music hath not de∣parted from its proper Character so far as the modern  Italian  I mean in its Gravity of Stile And this it seems probable hath been owing in Part to take established Choirs in FRANCE which are composed of regular  Eccle∣siastics  and therefore not so easily seduced to adopt a light and flaunting Species of Music as the wandering Bands of  Italian Castrati  Another concomitant Cause of this reserved and sober Music may probably have been the Mixture of the Protestant Party in FRANCE For these according to the Genius of every newreformed Sect adopted a grave and simple Melody They were therefore a salutary Check upon the established Church tending to the Prevention of open and scandalous AbusesLastly with Regard to the Article of  Performance  the  French  have greatly the Advantage in Point of Propriety and Decorum for as we have observed their Choirs are com∣posed of an established Priesthood who attend to this  peculiar Profession whose Characters are of higher Con∣sideration than those of the  Italian  Bands and whose Learning as well as Religion and Manners naturally lead them to a more reverent and devout Execution of their sacred Office  In ENGLAND the State of Things is in some Respects better and in some Respects worse than in FRANCE Our sacred Poetry sung in the  Cathedrals  is transcribed strictly from the  holy Scriptures  and most commonly from the Book of Psalms Except only the  Te Deum  which is one of the most ancient and approved Hymns of the Church This Restriction by which no Hymns of new Invention are admitted as a Part of divine Service we owe to the grand Reformation This opened to us the Foun∣tain of the sacred Writings which had before been locked up as in ITALY From the same Cause our  Anthems  are likewise given in our own Tongue which though not so various as the  Latin  is yet generally round and sonorous clearly accented and capable of being adapted to a Variety of musical Expression But while we justly ad∣mire the  sacred Poetry  of our  Cathedral  Service must we not lament the State of it in our  parochial  Churches where the cold the meagre the disgusting  Dulness  of STERNHOLD and his  Companions  hath  quenched  all the  poetic Fire  and  devout Majesty  of the  royal Psalmist  The Character of our  Cathedral Music  is of a  middle  Kind Not of the first Rank in the great Quality of  Ex∣pression  nor yet so improper or absurd as to deserve a ge∣neral Reprobation Too studious a Regard to  Fugues  and an artificial  Counterpoint  appears in the  old  and too  airy  and  light  a Turn to the Neglect of a grand Simpli∣city  in the  new  Two Extremes which tend equally though from opposite Causes to destroy  musical Expres∣sion  For a full View of this Subject see Mr AVISON's  Essay on musical Expression  Yet there are Passages in PURCEL's Anthems which may fairly stand in Competition with those of any Composer of whatever Country There are others who may justly claim a considerable Share of Praise HANDEL stands eminent in his Greatness and Sublimity of StyleOur  parochial Music  in general is solemn and devout Much better calculated for the Performance of a whole Congregation than if it were more broken and elaborate In Country Churches wherever a more artificial Kind hath been imprudently attempted Confusion and Disson∣ance are the general Consequence  The  Performance  of our Cathedral Music is defective We have no grand established Choirs of Priests as in FRANCE whose Dignity of Character might in a proper Degree maintain That of the divine Service This Duty is chiefly left to a Band of  LaySingers  whose Rank and Education are not of Weight to preserve their Profession from Contempt The Performance of our parochial Psalms though in the Villages it be often as mean and meagre as the Words that are sung yet in great Towns where a good Organ is skilfully and devoutly employed by a sensible Organist the Union of this Instrument with the Voices of a wellinstructed Congregation forms one of the grandest Scenes of unaffected Piety that human Nature can afford The Reverse of this appears when a Com∣pany of illiterate People form themselves into a  Choir  distinct from the Congregation Here Devotion is lost  between the impotent  Vanity  of those who  sing  and the ignorant  Wonder  of those who  listen  The  Oratorio  is a  dramatic Representation  of some Story taken from the sacred Scriptures or the Records of the Church accompanied with Music Its Origin is at∣tributed to the barbarous Period of the  Croisades  when Companies of  Pilgrims  returning from JERUSALEM formed themselves into  Choirs  and sung the Praises and Atchievements of Saints and Martyrs  MENETRIER  des Represent en Musique  Thus it is said to have arisen and been established in FRANCE But how it could assume the Form of  dramatic Representation accompanied with Music  is hard to say without supposing it like the  Opera  to have been the Effect of an  Imitation  On this principle we may trace it to a probable Origin It is well known that the Pagan Shews were often ex∣hibited in the Temples or at the Tombs of deceased Heroes 'Tis no less certain that the early Christians adopted the Practice with a due Change of Objects either from a mere Imitation of the Pagan Custom or with a View to the Conversion of Idolators Nothing therefore could be more natural than that the musical Accompanyment should remain though the Objects were changed Of this Mode of Piety we have a clear Instance in a Discourse of AUGUSTINE who condemned the Practice where speaking of CYPRIAN's Tomb he says  "Not many Years ago the Petulance of the Dancers had invaded this sacred Place where the Martyr's Body is laid All Night long prophane Songs were sung and were accompanied with theatrical Gesticulations  AUG  Serm in nat Divi  CYPRIANI  "  Now supposing this Practice to have still subsisted in some remote or obscure Part of ASIA or GREECE it might na∣turally be adopted by Companies of devout Pilgrims in their Peregrinations to the holy Land And thus the sa∣cred musical Drama would be  naturally produced  In ITALY the Origin of the  Oratorio  is said to have been more recent and clearly the Effect of an Imitation We are told that the famous PHILIP DE NERY a Na∣tive of FLORENCE and Founder of the Congregation of the Priests of the  Oratory  in the Year observing the strong Passion of the  Roman  People for  musical Represent∣ations  invented the  sacred Drama  with a View to their Improvement in Piety Hence it is said to have received the Name of  Oratorio  which it still wears The  Opera  already established at VENICE and ROME was his Model He had little more to do than to change the Objects from  Pagan  to  Christian  And thus from ITALY it spread into other Parts of EUROPE  BOURDELOT  Hist de la Musique  tom i p    The capital Impropriety and Defect of this Entertain∣ment while it wears the  dramatic  Form is the perpetual Recitative or musical Accompanyment in the interlocutory Parts similar to that of the  Opera  This is a Circum∣stance so repugnant to modern Manners and therefore so far out of Nature that no Audience can be much affected by the Representation or take Part in an Action so impro∣bably feigned The necessary Effect of This glaring Im∣probability is a general Inattention to the  Subject  and a Regard centered chiefly on the  Music  and  Execution  Of this Species of  Poem  the  Italians  have some fine ones written by METASTASIO They cannot perhaps be rank∣ed  in the first Class either for Sublimity or Pathos But Elegance of Style Simplicity of Plan and Conduct ani∣mated by a noble Spirit of Devotion prevails throughout these Compositions The  Music  of the  Oratorio  in ITALY too much resembles That of the  Opera  Simplicity Ma∣jesty and devout Expression are sacrificed to the Com∣poser's Vanity or illdirected Art  The  Performance  of this  sacred Drama  in ITALY is said to be attended with many of the same Circumstances of Impropriety with that of the  Opera  from which it had its Origin All tending to render it rather a Subject of mere Amusement than of Piety and Virtue Add to this that being performed in the Churches it may be questioned whether the Drama be dignified or the Temple prophaned by so inadequate a Representation  In FRANCE I do not find the  Oratorio  is now in Use Its first rude Form produced  Comedy  and  Tragedy  in that Kingdom But the Parent seems to have died at their Birth  BOILEAU  Art Poet    In ENGLAND this  sacred Drama  is in some Respects  well  in others  ill  conducted Next to the perpetual musical Accompanyment the leading Impropriety hath arisen from an entire  Separation  of the  Poet's  and  Musician's Office  Even when the  Poet  remains  principal  this Sepa∣ration tends to bad Effects But to compleat the Evil the  Musician's  Character hath here in many Instances assumed the  Precedence  and the  Poet  become  subservient  to him as his  Director  How this came to pass may be easily explained This Kind of Poem being unknown in ENG∣LAND  when HANDEL arrived and that great Musician being the first who introduced the  Oratorio  it became a Matter of Necessity that he should  employ  some Writer in his Service Now this being a Degradation to which Men of Genius would not easily submit he was forced to apply to  Versifiers  instead of  Poets  Thus the Poem was the Effect either of Hire or Favour when it ought to have been the voluntary Emanation of Genius Hence most of the Poems he composed to are such as would have sunk and disgraced any other Music than his own  But although his exalted Genius bore itself up against this Weight of Dulness yet such a leading Defect could not fail to have essential Effects on the Musician's Art For although no Man ever possessed greater Powers of musical Expression yet when the Writer gave him some∣times little and sometimes nothing to express the main Foundation of his Art failed him He was in the Situation of a great Painter who should be destined to give Life by Colours to a dead and unmeaning Design  The MESSIAH is an Exception to this general Remark Though that grand Musical Entertainment is called an  Oratorio  yet it is not  dramatic  but properly a Collection of  Hymns  or  Anthems  drawn from the sacred Scriptures In strict Propriety therefore it falls under another Class of Composition which we have already consideredThe  Oratorio  of SAMSON is properly  dramatic  But the Poem is so much changed in the Attempt towards accommodating it to Music that it can hardly be regarded as the Work of MILTONThe L'ALLEGRO and IL PENSEROSO are two elegant Poems and are finely set to Music by HANDEL But being merely  descriptive  and in no Degree  pathetic  they cannot be ranked among the highest Forms of Poetry nor could they give Play to his highest Powers of Expression  Nay even where any Degree of poetical Expression happened to give Play to his expressive Powers yet still the general  Composition being unconnected weak and unaffecting there could be neither Contrast nor Succession of pathetic Songs and Choirs which when properly united in one great Subject heighten each other by a continued Pro∣gression like the successive Scenes of a  wellplan'd Tragedy  Had HANDEL's Airs and Choirs been composed in this connected Manner and the Probability of the Represen∣tation in other Respects preserved their Effect had been proportionable At present being often disjoined and deprived of that Connexion which ought to arise from the Poet's Art they lose all the Force which an Accumulation of Passion would have produced They stand single While in a wellconducted Poem the Effect of every  suc∣ceeding  Song or Choir would be heightened by the Power of the  preceding  But while we pay all due Regard to the Memory of this great Musician and acknowledge nay maintain that his Compositions often arise to the highest Pitch of  Sublimity  and  Pathos  critical Justice demands some farther Remarks on this Subject for the Sake of future ArtistsAs a neces∣sary Consequence therefore of the  Separation  of the  Poet's  and  Musician's  Province and of his too great At∣tention to the  latter  his Music is sometimes improperly conducted even where it is not influenced by the Defects of the Poem From this Separation in which he only complied with the established Practice of the Times the following incidental Defects naturally arose Too much musical Division upon single Syllables to the Neglect of the Sense and Meaning of the Song A partial Imitation of incidental Words instead of a proper Expression of the ruling Sentiments even when such Words and Sentiments happen to be con∣trary  to each other Solo Songs often too much lengthened without the Intervention of the Choir to in∣spirit and sustain them Especially the  Da Capo  is almost in every Instance of bad Effect as it renders the first and capital Part of the Song  insipid  by an  unmeaning Repeti∣tion  Choirs sometimes too much lengthened without the Intervention of single Songs or Duets for the necessary Repose of the Ear which is apt to be fatigued and dis∣gusted by such a longcontinued and forcible Impression Choirs sometimes though seldom calculated more for the Display of the Composer's Art in the Construction of  Fugues  and  Canons  than for a natural Expression of the Subject The  Choir  in  many  Instances and the  single Song  in  some  not  sudden  enough in its Intervention being generally  prepared  by a correspondent Symphony of instrumental Music which creates Expectation and Pre∣sentiment destroys Surprize and thus  lessens  the  Impression  and  Effect  Instances might be produced of all these Defects in the Compositions of this great Master But they arose not so much from Himself as from the Period in which he lived Therefore the Writer chuseth to cast them into Shades refering them to the Observation and Regard of musical Professors rather than seem to fix a Mark of Disrespect on any particular Composition of a Man whose exalted Genius he reveres And upon the whole his  Airs Duets  and  Choirs  as they surpass every thing yet produced in Gran∣deur and Expression so they will ever be the richest Fountain for  Imitation  or  Adoption  and even singly taken will justly command the Regard and Admiration of all succeeding Ages  The  Performance  of the  Oratorio  in ENGLAND under its present defective State in some Respects may be cen∣sured in others is to be approved The Exhibition of the Choir and accompanying Band is not only decent but grand and striking A becoming Gravity attends it both among the Performers and the Audience The Airs and Choirs are often sung with a Decorum not unsuitable to the Dignity of the Occasion On the other Hand there are Defects which naturally arise from the  Separation  of the  Performer's  from the  Poet's  and  Musician's  ArtThe Singers are not always so animated in their Manner as to create a Belief in the Audience whenever a true poetic and musical Expression are united that they feel the Sen∣timents they express If a grand Simplicity of Performance were still more studied it would give an additional Lustre to their Talents Above all the  flourished Close  or  Ca∣dence  is below the Dignity of the  sacred Drama  and absolutely destructive of all true musical Expression  Thus we have traced the  Rise Union Power Progres∣sions Separations  and  Corruptions  of  Poetry  and  Music  together with the  Causes  of these several  Gradations  from their first Appearance in the  savage  State down to their present Forms in the more  polished Nations  of EUROPE  SECT XIII Of the possible Reunion of Poetry and Music  IT remains now to consider the Circumstances in which and the means by which 'tis possible that the Arts of Poetry and Music may again be powerfully and ef∣fectually united after these Separations have taken Place  The  Legislator's  and  Bard's  Character cannot again be  generally  and  fully united  We have seen they na∣turally separate in an early Period of Civilization And the Departments become so distinct as to create a general Incompatibility and Repugnance too clear to need an Illustration But although the Legislator can∣not generally maintain the poetic and musical Character he may still continue to  protect  and sometimes even to  possess  it And when Poetry and Music are united in their proper Ends there are few  secondary Accomplishments  which do truer Honour even to the highest Stations It was indeed a ridiculous Vanity in a late  Emperor  to sing in an Opera as it was in LOUIS the Fourteenth to dance on a parallel Occasion because in these Instances the Arts were separated from their Important Ends But it was a noble Example in CHARLEMAGNE when he dig∣nified his Choir by joining them in the public Act of Religion and singing divine Service in his imperial Robes HENRY the Second and FRANCIS the First of FRANCE CHARLES the Great of GERMANY ALFRID the Great of ENGLAND were all distinguished not only by their  Love  and  Protection  of the musical and poetic Arts but by their  Proficiency  in them as applied to their highest Ends  And as the Legislator may still incidentally retain a Part of the Poet's Dignity so the Poet though no longer a Legislator may still occasionally exert his salutary Power by his Influence on the Passions of the SoulCHARLES the Ninth of FRANCE who not only composed and per∣formed Church Music but writ elegant Verses addressed a little Poem to RONSARD which does equal Honour to the  Prince  and the  Poet  And as it so nobly asserts the  Dignity of the musical and poetic Arts and points at their original Alliance with the legislative Character the fol∣lowing Citation seems to claim a Place under this Article  Ton Esprit enflammé d'une celeste Ardeur  Eclatte par soymeme moy par ma Grandeur  Ta Lyre qui ravit par de si doux Accords  T'asservit les Esprits dont je n'ay que le Corps  Elle t' en rend le Maitre te sçait introduire  Oú la plus fier Tyran ne peut avoir d'Empire  The  Poet's  and  Musician's  Office cannot probably be again united in their full and general Power For in their present refined State either of their Arts separately con∣sidered is of such  Extent  that although they may inci∣dentally meet in one Person they cannot often be found togetherOne Expedient there is indeed by which the two Arts may be practically united by the same Person That is if the  Poet  select and adapt proper  Music  to his Poem or the  Musician  select and adapt proper  Poetry  to his Music Let us then consider which of these Methods is most likely to succeed in uniting the two Arts  effectually  Now though we suppose the Musician to be of sufficient Ability to distinguish  good  Poetry from  bad  we must farther observe that to collect various Passages from vari∣ous Poets and form them into one  whole  with Propriety and Force would be a Task difficult if not impossible For the Expressions of Poetry are  particular  and un∣alterably  appropriated  to their Subject They are therefore generally incapable of a second Application The Fact is quite otherwise in Music For here the Expressions are  general  and  vague  it is the  Poetry  to which they are applied which fixeth and gives them their  particular Ex∣pression  Therefore a Selection of various Pieces may be made and united in one  whole  with Propriety and Effect This Union is indeed sometimes made in an unmeaning Way in what the  Italians  call a  Pasticio  Where we commonly see a Series of Songs thrown together without Connexion or Design But if we suppose a Poem properly conducted and adapted to Music of the first Excellence in Subserviency to the Genius of the Poem 'tis plain that the Music so applied may acquire a Force of Expression more powerful in the  second  Application than in the  first  As to resume a former Allusion the same Kind of  Colours  may acquire a stronger Effect by being employed on a  forcible  than an  insipid Drawing  This is an  Union  far easier to  attempt  than to  accomplish  However thus much it seemed proper to remark lest every Endeavour of this Kind should be regarded as a mere  Pasticio  The  Singer's  Profession can seldom be united with that of the  Poet  and not generally with that of the  Musician  The same Cause will maintain the Separation here as in the poetic and musical Professions The Arts in their present refined and complicated State separately demand such continued Application and various Qualities as seldom meet in the same Person'Tis the Performer's Province therefore in this State of Separation to conform to the Genius of the  Poem  and the  Music  As the Musician is subordinate to the Poet so the Performer is subordinate to  Both  The  Epic  Poem cannot be again united with  Music  The Reasons may be collected from the preceding Parts of this Dissertation The long Narrations the frequent Dialogue the Mixture of calm Description and unim∣passioned  Sentiment all these are clearly incompatible with the musical Alliance unless where longcontinued Custom and a PreEstablishment drawn from savage Manners had produced and confirmed an Union But this once broken can never be effectually restored For it must ever want that Foundation of  Habit  on which it first arose and gain∣ed its Power  See above Sect vi Art    The  Tragic  Poem can never again be powerfully united with Music This repugnance ariseth from the same Cause with the last For here the continued musical Accompanyment mixing itself with the dramatic Cha∣racter and the perpetual Dialogue forms a  whole  so incom∣patible with modern Manners and so far out of known Nature as destroys that Probability which is the first Foundation of a true Pathos  The  Ode  or  hymnal  Species may be again properly and forcibly united with  Music  We have already seen the Foundation on which this Species is more universally al∣lied with Melody than any other  Sect vi Art  The great Mean of their powerful Union must be a pathetic and correspondent Simplicity of Composition in BothWith Respect to the pathetic Simplicity of the  Ode  although the obscure the learned the cold the florid the wordy the amusing Style hath been too generally adopted by the Moderns yet this false Manner is not so strongly established as to preclude all Possibility of a general Reform For we find that where the Poem is written in the simple intelligible and pathetic Form it is more generally approved except only by  mere Scholars  who are ignorant of Nature than  the opposite Manner of false Refinement In Proof of this we need only alledge the two noble Odes of POPE and DRYDEN which the world in general understand feel and admire  A  simple  and  pathetic Melody  may be no less successfully adopted and applied to Poetry This is evident from the incidental and frequent Practice of the greatest Masters HANDEL MARCELLO BONONCINI CORELLI GEMI∣NIANI and their best Disciples are often admirable in the pathetic Simplicity of Song More especially they are so when they are fortunate enough to forget the Ostenta∣tion and Parade of Art The Success is answerable to their Desert For this Simplicity of Style is admired be∣yond the artificial by  All  except only a  Few  whose Taste like that of the mere  ScholarTribe  is debauched by their own false Refinements  Here it may be proper to point out on what Foundation a  simple Melody  is more  pathetic  than a  complex  and  artificial  In the Expression of the Passions Nature doth not offer musical Sounds to the human Ear For though the natural Tones of  Grief  and  Joy  the two Passions which are most effectually expressed by Music approach nearer to musical Precision than any other yet still they are in a certain Degree inconcinnous and unmusical As the Tones of the Passions are in some Degree unmusical so are they generally more simple in their Composition or Succession than the Tones which are commonly employed to form a regular Melody From the first of these Remarks it follows that all musical Expression of the Passions must be  imperfect  For the musical Sounds not being found in Nature if the Artist strictly imitates the Sounds he hears they will be un∣musical if he varies from Nature so as to make them musical the Imitation will be defective Yet Imagination hath a Power of im∣posing its impressions on Reason in a certain Degree This we find at the proper Representation of a Tragedy where though the Scenery the Persons the Dresses the Composition and other accompanying Ob∣jects are not a precise Transcript from Nature that is though the Imi∣tation be defective yet still it is highly affecting But if the Representation departs from Nature beyond a certain Degree Reason then revolts and the affecting Power is lost And thus musical Imitation though imperfect in a certain Degree still boasts its Power If imperfect  beyond  a certain Degree its affecting Power is lost But as it follows from the second Re∣mark that the farther musical Sounds depart from  Simplicity  the farther they depart from  Nature  so the Consequence is clear that a  simple Melody  though an imperfect Imitation may be  pathetic  while a  complex  and  artificial  Melody by departing from Nature beyond a certain Degree will entirely  lose  its  affecting Power  This naturally leads to the Consideration of a mysterious Circumstance which lies yet unaccounted for at the very Foundation of musical Ex∣pression The Fact is this that  "musical Sounds which are employed to express Passions as Grief or Joy by an  imperfect Imitation  are often  more affecting  than the  natural  or  perfect Voice  of these Passions when given without musical Intonations"  It seems not easy to assign a clear and sufficient Cause for this Appearance Let the following Conjectures have what Weight they may Have not musical Sounds a mechanical Power over the human Frame by which they awaken it into a higher Degree of  Sensibility  and  Sympathy  than it possesseth in its more  cool  and  torpid  State Are we not generally so constituted as to sympathize much more strongly with those in whom we find amiable Qualities than their Opposites And as Pity melts the Soul to Love so doth not Love melt the Soul to Pity Doth not a  sweet Voice  like a  fine Countenance  create a strong  Prejudice  in  Favour  of its  Possessor  and induce a  Belief  of  amiable  inherent  Qualities  May not the Voice and Figure of a distressed or joyous Object be so horrid or uncouth ridiculous or ugly as in a great Measure to lessen if not totally to destroy the Sympathy of those who hear and see itIf these Observations be true then by carrying the Voices or Expressions of Grief or Joy into sweeter Tones and higher Degrees of Melody than they possess in Nature yet still preserving the Resemblance so far as not to destroy Probability may we not on the Principles here given create a higher Degree of Affection and Sympathy than the natural Voice of the Passions can give    Yet there is one Circumstance in which modern Poetry and Music though both reduced to their full Simplicity cannot obtain that perfect Union which they held in an∣cient GREECE The Numbers of the Poem and the Mea∣sure  of the Music will inevitably sometimes clash That Variety of Feet with which the Greek Tongue abound∣ed gave such Play to the Musician's Art in adapting a  various  and  correspondent Melody  as no living Language can boast For Want of this Variety of Feet there is generally a  dead Uniformity  in the Structure of modern Verse The musical Rythm or Measure therefore must either want the necessary  Variety  or must  sometimes  be at Variance with the poetic Numbers  The Arts of Poetry and Music thus properly united and improved may possibly by Degrees be made a Part of  Education  and applied to the Culture of the youthful Mind in Subjects  religious political  and  moral  This is a large Field of Observation which at present it may be more prudent rather to  open  than to  tread  In Favour of this Opinion we may recollect the wonderful Powers of these united Arts exhibited above not only in the Scenes of savage Nature but among the civilized Republics of ancient GREECE And as we possess a nobler System of Religion Polity and Morals than they could ever boast so the Application of the Sister Arts to these under a strict Subordination to Truth might seem to promise the noblest Consequences in the Education of Youth Yet on the other Hand it must be owned that under the present State of Manners and the established Forms of Education this event is rather to be wished than hoped for Instead therefore of urging a Theory which might be regarded as visionary and chimerical the Writer will for the present content himself with pointing out  "In what Respects the four principal Kinds in which Poetry and Music are now united may be either improved in their Form or more effectually directed to their proper Ends"  The first of these the common  Song  or  Canzonette  may perhaps be judged an Object too inconsiderable for any serious Proposal of a Reform But the Writer will not be ashamed to follow the Example of the greatest Authors among the ancient  Greeks  in recommending the early Practice of a proper domestic Music as tending powerfully to sooth the discordant Passions to influence the Taste and fix the morals of Youth If we reflect now apt the youthful Ear is to catch musical Impressions and how open the Heart to every Impression so forcibly convey'd it cannot be regarded as a Matter of Indifference among those who understand the Force of early Habits whether these first impressions be  properly  or  improperly  directed It may seem a Paradox though perhaps a cer∣tain Truth that the future and leading Colour of the Passions in both Sexes hath often been determined by a  Song  Poets and Musicians therefore would do them∣selves the truest Honour if they would religiously abstain from lending the attractive Colours of their respective Arts to the Embellishment of Licentiousness and Vice  The Writer would not subject himself to such an Im∣putation of Ignorance as to suggest the Possibility of renewing the old  Grecian  Practice when Men of the first Rank and Dignity disdained not to grace the Feast with Songs  religious political  and  moral  with the Celebration of  Gods Heroes  and  Virtues  At the very Mention of this obsolete Practice he sees Ridicule pouring in from every Quarter 'Tis enough to hope from the present  fashionable  World that they will  abstain  from  Songs  of an  opposite Nature  As the practicable Utility of the common  Song  or  Can∣zonette  seems to lie chiefly among the younger ranks an easy and familiar Simplicity of Style and Manner seems peculiarly its proper Character To this ought to be added where the Subject will admit a certain Festivity and Brilliancy of Taste that the most attractive Colours of the Arts may be thrown on Virtue and Benevolence Generosity and Greatness of Soul may habitually mix themselves with domestic and social Amusement  The  Anthem  with Respect to its  Subject  neither needs nor admits Improvement being drawn from the sa∣cred Scriptures  Although it be a prudent Reserve in the Church of ENGLAND to admit no other Poetry than the  sacred  into divine Service yet still for the high Purpose of domestic or private Devotion and Practice the Com∣position of  Hymns  would be a noble Addition to the Poetry and Music of a rational Society of Christians Here the Poet would have Room for a Display of that Genius which the Prudence of the established Church hath prevented in the wise Regulation of her public Service Of this Kind may be justly regarded that fine  Ode  of POPE intitled "  The dying Christian to his Soul  "  A proper  Selection  of Words for Music is indeed a Work of Importance here And though in many Instances this be well made yet it were to be wished that some superior Judgment would  oversee  and sometimes  negatively  at least  direct  the Composer for the Preven∣tion of  Improprieties  A parallel remark will extend it∣self almost to the whole Book of Psalms as they are versified by STERNHOLD for the Use of parochial Churches There are few Stanzas which do not present Expressions to excite the Ridicule of some Part of every Congregation This Version might well be abolished as it exposeth one of the noblest Parts of divine Service to Contempt Especially as there is another Version already  privileged which though not excellent is however  not in∣tolerable  The  parochial Music  seems to need no Reform Its Simplicity and Solemnity suit well its general Desti∣nation and it is of Power when properly performed to raise Affections of the noblest Nature It were to be wished that the  Cathedral Music  were always composed with a proportioned Sobriety and Reserve Here as we have observed the whole is apt to degenerate too much into an Affair of Art A great and pathetic Simplicity of Style kept ever in Subserviency to the sacred Poetry ought to be aimed at as the truest and the only Praise The same devout Simplicity of Manner may be attained in the Performance and ought to be studied by the Organist and  Choir  Their Ambition should lie in a natural and dignified Execution not in a curious Display of Art The Maxim of AUGUSTINE was excellent and deserves the serious Attention both of those who perform and those who hear  "I always think myself blameable when I am drawn to attend more to the  Singer  than to  what is Sung  "  But an additional Circumstance seems necessary as a Means of bringing back Church Music to its original Dignity and Use We have seen in the Course of this Dissertation how the Separations follow each other in the Decline of the poetic and musical Arts And for the sake of Truth we must here observe that in the Per∣formance of Cathedral Music a Separation hath long taken Place fatal to its true Utility The higher Ranks of the Church do not think themselves concerned in the Per∣formance It were devoutly to be wished that the musical Education were so general as to enable the Clergy of whatever Rank to join the Choir in the Celebration of  their Creator in all its appointed Forms The Laity would be naturally led to follow so powerful an Exam∣pleThere is Reason to believe that this Separation was in Part occasioned by the Introduction of an artificial Music which became too difficult in the Execution for any but professed Musicians Here then we find an ad∣ditional Motive for bringing down the Cathedral Music from its present complex and artificial Style to that of Simplicity and easy Execution  With Respect to the two dramatic Forms the  Opera  and  Oratorio  we have already pointed out their chief Defects as they exist in their present State But as to an effectual Reformation such as may produce their proper  Ends  it seems utterly impracticable while the  dra∣matic Form  and the  musical Accompanyment  remain in  Union  To hear Kings Warriours Statesmen Philo∣sophers Patriarchs Saints and Martyrs holding long Conversations with each other in musical Recitative is a Circumstance so totally out of Nature that the Imagin∣ation immediately revolts and rejects the Representation as absurd and incredible The  Recitative  therefore or perpetual musical Accompanyment which prevails in both being thus unalterably at Variance with the  dramatic Form  the  one  or the  other  must be  destroyed  ere  Proba∣bility  and  Pathos  can arise  One Method of a Reform may be effected by destroying the  Recitative  or perpetual  musical  Accompanyment And in this Case the Interlocutory Part would sink into the common Form of  Tragedy  A  musical Choir  distinct from the Persons of the Drama might still be introduced  occasionally  with much Propriety and Effect  I say  occasionally  For the  continuing  Choir of the old  Greek  Tra∣gedy would be a Circumstance as far out of Nature as the Recitative it∣self Besides the perpetual and continuing Choir would rob modern Tragedy of half her Powers and Graces A strict Unity of Place and Time as we have seen are its necessary Consequences  See above Sect vi Art  But with Respect to what is of far greater Importance I mean the  Action  its Effects upon the whole were  bad  'Tis true that even here it had the natural Effect of producing  Unity  But while it secured the  Unity  of the  Action  it gene∣rally destroyed its  Force  For there are few great distressful or terrible Actions which do not require some  Variety  of  Place  in Order to unfold them in all their most pathetic Situations and striking Aspects Many of these therefore must be lost to the Poet and his Audience and a feeble and meagre Fable must generally arise from that strict Unity of Place which the continuing Choir produced Hence we often find the Greek Tragedians reduced to the Necessity of conveying by Narration many affecting Incidents which would have formed capital Scenes could they have been introduced consistently with the Unity of Place Were it necessary to inlarge on this Subject which is not incurious it might be proved by an Induction of particulars that there is not a great and affecting Tragic Action in the whole Compass of Antiquity but what is miserably cramped and maimed by this Constraint  That  of the  Oedipus Tyrannus  only excepted which indeed seems nearly if not absolutely perfect in all the Parts of its Construction  Above all the Occosions must have a strong Reference to the most pathetic Situations of the tragic action The  Choir  must consist of such Characters as may with  Probability  appear in the musical Department The Ode must be written in the Style of Passion not with the Parade of unaffecting Imagery or tedious Allegory which instead of rowzing an Audience would lull them to Repose The Music and Performance must be of a correspondent Nature In pointing out this Reform of the musical Drama the Writer may seem to separate the two Sister  Arts instead of uniting them But in Reality he only proposes their Separation in one Circumstance as the necessary means of compleating their Union in another  But lest this should seem to confine the musical Art to an Alliance with the mere  Ode  or  Hymn  only and to banish it entirely from the Representation of  Actions  let us now proceed to another and more perfect Kind of Re∣form in which many of the  Subjects  of the  Opera  and  Oratorio  may be exhibited in  full Union  with the  Powers of Music  joined with  Probability  and  Nature  We have seen above that from an Union of the  Ode  and  Epic  a first rude Outline of Tragedy naturally arose compounded of  musical Narration  and  choral Song  See above Sect vi Art  Here then let us fix for the proper Form of the musical Exhi∣bition of great terrible or pathetic Actions This Union forms what may properly be styled the  Narrative  or  Epic Ode  It arose from Nature at a Period when the Actions represented were of the  simplest  Kind  See ibid  This Simpli∣city of Action is still necessary to be preserved for the Perfection of this Species because a complicated Action would inevitably produce long and unanimated Narra∣tions would unnerve the musical Recitation and destroy the very Genius of the Poem Supposing then the Action to be simple and impassioned the  Poem  the  Music  and  Performance  if well conducted will be at∣tended with such a Degree of  Nature  and  Probability  as will give the Alliance of Poetry and Music their highest Power and Pathos The intermixed Narrations must be short and animated The Songs and Choirs various and  expressive and being frequently interrupted by the brief Recitals may by these Means be inspirited far beyond the simple and continued Ode which from its unbroken Length often degenerates into Languor By this Union all the striking Parts of the Action may be brought forth to View while every thing that is cold improbable and unaffecting may be veiled in DarknessThe  Recitative  or musical Accompanyment in the  narrative  Parts will  here  lose a great Part of that Improbability which incumbers it in the  dramatic  Representation For  here  the  Reciter  is a professed Musician whose Province lies in the Enthu∣siasm of Song and the  Narrations  being  short  and  animated  beyond what is possible in the continued Use of  Dialogue  they approach nearer to the Genius of the  Ode  and there∣fore may without Improbability or Impropriety receive a musical Accompanyment which approaches nearer to a full and direct SongAnd lastly the  Songs  and  Choirs  are in their Performance so far from being unnatural that they are no more than a powerful Transcript from Nature impelling those who hear the Recital of the Action and are instructed in the Laws of Melody to join in every represented Scene of Joy Triumph Terror Exultation Devotion or Distress  Of this  narrative or Epic Ode  we have two fine Exam∣ples in our Language written by POPE and DRYDEN In Force of Passion and Variety of correspondent Versi∣fication  We have shewn above that the Return of the  same Measure  in the  Strophe Antistrophe  and  Epode  of the ancient  Greek Ode  was the natural Consequence of its Union with the  Dance  But this Union being irre∣coverably lost the unvaried Measure of the Ode becomes at best an un∣meaning Thing and is indeed an absurd one as it deprives the Poet of that Variety of Measure which often gives a great Energy to the Com∣position by the incidental and sudden Intervention of an  abrupt  or  lengthened  Versification The two Odes here mentioned contain a Variety of fine Examples in this Kind of Beauty  they are admirable The Songs and Choirs  are by Turns tender joyous and majestic and are often calculated for the noblest and most powerful Union of Poetry and Music On the other Hand while their un∣rivalled Excellence is admitted critical Justice demands that we point out some Blemishes in these two immortal Odes lest an undistinguishing Principle of Imitation should lead to an Adoption of their Faults along with their Beau∣tiesWith Respect to Mr POPE's Ode on St CECILIA's Day the  Subject  seems to want  Unity  It is not a Recital of  one  great Action but rather a poetic Description of the  Adventures  of ORPHEUSMr DRYDEN's Ode is perfect in the Unity of the Action but  imperfect  in the  moral End  For it is a Representation of the abused Power of Music in firing a young Prince to an Act of Revenge and Cruelty In the Execution there is but one Er∣ror of Consequence which seems to run through both these Odes so justly celebrated The  Narrative  Part is not always sufficiently  distinguished  from the  Song  They run into each other in such a Manner that the musical Composer must often find himself embarassed whether to accompany with Recitative or a more compleat Melody Indeed it is manifest that these illustrious Poets were not aware of this Distinction And hence it came to pass that many Passages which they evidently meant for  Song  are in the Form of  Narration  But let this be added as a Justice due to these celebrated Names that the Nar∣rations  are in some Parts so highly animated that without any striking Impropriety they admit the Accompanyment either of the Song or Choir 'Tis obvious to remark that HANDEL was sometimes perplexed by this Irregularity of the poetic Composition when he set DRYDEN's Ode to Music For some Parts are thrown into Recitative which might seem rather to demand the Song and others are thrown into Song which in their present Narrative Form seem rather to demand the RecitativeA Poet of inferior Rank  Mr HUGHES  hath attempted to rectify this Disorder in DRYDEN's  Ode  But he had not sufficiently estimated his own Strength when he adventured to tamper with the Bow of ULYSSES Whenever he hath attempted a  Change  he hath quenched the poetic Fire  The Subjects of the narrative or  Epic Ode  may be drawn with Propriety either from  ethnical  or  sacred Story  The  ethnical  will furnish those which are  moral  or  political  the  sacred  is a rich Field of Subjects  moral  and  religious  There is a peculiar Propriety in exhibiting the sacred Story in this Manner of the  Epic Ode  because in the dramatic Representation of antique Subjects through the great Dissimilarity of ancient Manners to our own 'tis difficult to avoid the Introduction of Circumstances which will not be either manifestly  incongruous  or  contemptible  to an  Eye  merely  modern  two Appearances which are carefully to be avoided in the Representation of sacred Story The Way of  Narration  therefore is highly preferable be∣cause in this the Poet can produce the greatest and most striking Situations and at the same Time preserve both  Probability  and  Respect  by throwing the rest into Shades  That this Representation of sacred Subjects is the highest and most interesting Union of Poetry and Music needs no elaborate Proof It stands intimately connected with all the sublime Truths the great and affecting Events of our Religion which when thus exhibited by the united Powers of  Poem  and  Song  call forth all the noblest Emotions of the human Soul and exalt it to the highest Pitch of Elevation that our mortal Condition will admit  SECT XIV CONCLUSION  THUS far then at least the poetic and musical Arts may admit an effectual Reunion so as to produce their noblest Ends As to any farther Consequences they must be the Effect of this first Reform And therefore till something be done here it can be of no Importance to point out higher Improvements which in the present State of Things would certainly be esteemed chimerical  Let us then for the present conclude with offering a Question  "Whether our Age and Nation might not still farther distinguish itself in its Regard for the nobler Arts by the Institution of  A Poetic and Musical Academy  for the more effectual  Reunion  of these two Arts and their better  Direction  to their  highest Ends  "  The Judgment of an able and disinterested Society established for this Purpose might perhaps effect every Reform here proposed in the four distinct Species in which the two Arts are still imperfectly and improperly united The Prize must be Honour only lest mercenary Spirits  should intrude upon the Walk of Genius It may be sup∣posed that the best Poets of the rising Age at least would court the Approbation of such an Academy And from this Institution as from a Nursery of these SisterArts a Succession of approved Poems would naturally arise in every Form that could properly receive the Colourings and Embellishments of MusicThe familiar  Song  com∣posed for domestic and social Entertainment when thus chastised by the moral Decrees of the Academy would gradually rise into its ancient Dignity and UseThe Selection of the  Anthem  from the sacred Scriptures might receive the public Approbation of the Society And the  Hymn  controuled by the same sober Judgments would as∣sume that pathetic Sublimity and Simplicity of Style which tends to elevate the Soul to the Contemplation and Love of divine ThingsThe  tragic Choir  properly restrained and limited by such an Authority might  oc∣casionally  be introduced and applied to the Increase of Pity and Terror and to all the moral Ends of the dramatic Species The  Epic Ode  directed by the Taste and Wis∣dom of this Academy would obtain its Completion The greatest and most affecting Subjects drawn from the History of our own or other Countries would rise before us while the sublimest and most interesting Events re∣corded in the sacred Scriptures thus recommended and adorned would make their Way through the nobler Pas∣sions to the Heart  The State and Character of our  Music  would be no less influenced by the Authority of such an Institution The Poems which should receive its unbiassed Approbation would naturally become Objects of the Ambition of our  best  Composers  Whose Genius thus chastised and di∣rected to its proper Ends would no longer wander into the illegitimate Fantasies of Song but in just Subor∣dination to the poetic Expressions would only be am∣bitious of joining its Powers for the Production of a true  Pathos  The  Performance  of these approved  Poems  thus heighten∣ed by approved  Music  would naturally correspond with the Genius of Both if under the Controul of the same wise Judgments The  Singers  would no longer think themselves at Liberty to desert their Subject for the Pride of Execution But under the Inspection of a superior Taste and Authority would be led to adopt a true Sim∣plicity of Manner and like the just  Actor  would be only ambitious of assisting the Poet and Musician in adorn∣ing and compleating the intended Representation  The  Importance  of such an Institution may deserve our most serious thoughts We have seen above how con∣genial the  poetic  and  musical  Arts are with the Frame and Faculties of Man That in every Period of Manners whether savage barbarous civilized refined or cor∣rupted their Influence hath been felt in every Nation of the Earth So universal and powerful are their Effects on the Passions of the Soul that perhaps no Period of human Nature can be assigned at least the Writer knows of none in which they have not been either  salu∣tary  or  pernicious  In which they have not either tended to promote and confirm Religion Virtue and public Hap∣piness or been the Instruments of Licentiousness and public Ruin  Add to this that whoever will look back into the pre∣ceding Pages will find that in all  polished States  these Arts have a natural Tendency towards Corruption unless checked and chastised by wholesome Institutions This Tendency ariseth not from the Nature of the Arts them∣selves but from that  Period of Manners  which tends to pervert them from their  proper Ends  Would you quench this natural Flame implanted in the human Breast The Attempt were Folly You must destroy our  Eyes  and  Ears  those Inlets to the Powers of  Poetry  and  Music  before you can accomplish such a Purpose What then is to be done but to regulate this mighty Stream which will inevitably run either in the Channel of  Vice  or  Virtue  More particularly in a great and powerful Kingdom where additional Degrees of Wealth should flow in with every Tide these especially in a Time of Peace must in∣evitably be followed by new Degrees of inventive Luxury and an unwearied Passion for Dissipation and Amusement Hence the peculiar Danger would arise even where no ill Intentions should dwell of a Perversion of the  mimetic  and especially of the  poetic  and  musical Arts  from their proper and exalted to their improper and ignoble EndsIf in such a Kingdom their lowest Forms should be sought for while their higher were neglected if Tragedy should give Way to Comedy and Comedy to Farce and Farce to Pantomime if Privileges should be denied to the  Labours  of  Genius  which were indulged to the Tricks of  Harlequin  and  Pierot  what could be more justly feared than a general Decline of Taste which by silent and un∣perceived Degrees might insensibly slide into the same  fatal Effects which marked the later Periods of the  Greek  Republics and the  Roman  Empire  On the contrary an effectual Union of these two power∣ful Arts directed to their proper Ends would be pro∣ductive of the noblest Consequences It would renew and augment the Dignity of every elegant Accomplishment would refine the Taste inforce the Religion purify the Morals strengthen the Policy of the most prosperous Kingdom in a Word would give a proper and salutary Direction to that Overflow of Wealth which must either  adorn  or  overwhelm  it  An  Institution  therefore which may promote such  im∣portant Ends  may seem not only to claim the Atten∣tion of the  Wise  and  Good  in every private Station but might perhaps be regarded as not unworthy the  Protection  of the  best  and  greatest  KING  THE END  APPENDIX  The following Memoir which was lately communicated to the Author by an honourable Gentleman hath Reference to p of the preceding

First yet the whole  Order  was by no means exterminated  dly  That in the Reign of ELIZABETH Abuses had crept on among the  Welsh Bards  similar to those which are re∣corded of the  Irish    dly  That public  Contests  for  poetic  and  musical Fame  had been established in  Wales  from an∣cient Times  thly  That these Contests are now ceased  In Wotton's "Leges Wallicae" Append p there are two Laws of Henry the Fourth recorded which relate to the Prevention of the Abuses of the Bard's Pro∣fession but in such general Terms that nothing relative to the particular State of their Music and
