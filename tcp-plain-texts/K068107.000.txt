Advertisement  WHereas Her Majesty has been Graciously Pleas'd on all Occasions to express Her truly Royal and Religious Concern for promoting the Welfare of Her Subjects and particularly for uniting them in their Common Interest against the Common Enemy On the contrary Our Domestick and most Dangerous Enemies have been Indefatigable in their Industry to obstruct these glorious Designs of Her Majesty and Her Ministers by fomenting our Animosities and perpetuating our unhappy Divisions  And whether those Weekly Papers from whence this Collection is taken may not be reckon'd amongst these mischievous Engines that have been set at Work for some Years past is humbly submitted to the Consideration of the Persons in Authority as a necessary Duty and Service to he Publick  A COLLECTION OF Several Paragraphs Out of Mr  Dyer  's LETTERS  London May d  YEsterday my LordKeeper sent out Writs for a New Parliament and the first Election will be on  Monday  next at  Malden  in  Essex  where two honest Loyal Gentlemen called by the Whigs  Tackers  will be chosen The rest of the Elections will come on very quick and be soon over  May th  OUR Port Letters have nothing in them considerable nor have we any publick News but what relates to the approaching Elections and more particularly from  Exon  we have an Account of the honourable  Reception there of  John Snell    Esq  one of the  Representatives  in the late  Parliament  an honest loyal and brave  Tacker  who arrived from  London  on the st instant having been met some Miles out of Town by above Horse and some Foot compos'd of the Neighbouring  Gentry  with the  Clergy    Aldermen  and principal  Citizens  who conducted him to his own House with the City Musick playing before him the Streets ecchoing with these Acclamations  God bless the Loyal Tackers and send the Sneakers more Honesty and Courage  At  Dartmouth  they have that Veneration for the Service of their worthy  Representatives    Fred and Nat Hern  Esquires that they have  Christen'd  a  Ship  by the Name of  Tacker  We hear that  Strangers  are like to be chosen in  Wiltshire  not one of them having a Foot of Land in that County to the Reproach of the  Electors  for not having a greater Value for the honest loyal neighbouring  Gentry  May th  WE have an Account that these Elections were made Yesterday  viz Malden  in  Essex    Will Fytche  and  Joh Comyns  Esquires  Tackers  Town of  Hertford    Charles Caesar  and  Rich Gulston  Esquires  Tackers Agmondesham  Lord  Cheyne  and Sir  Sam Garrard  Bar' the last a  Tacker  the other a  WellWisher  to them so that here's five out of six which is a good Beginning and it's believed very few of the will miss of their Elections notwithstanding the senseless Clamours of  Whiggish Libellers  Sir  Will Drake  has brought an Action against an  Attorney  of  Exon  for calling him  Tacker  and saying he's a Friend to  France  The  B  of  S  labours Tooth and Nail to oppose these sort of Gentlemen declaring from the Pulpit that it was the Orders of the Q  n and the D  of  M  to excite the People against the  Tackers  and sent the ensuing Circular Letters to the inferiour  Clergy  of his Diocess  viz  Gentlemen  I have been B  here    Years and never medled with any Elections till now but now the Q  n seeing which way things are going gave us particular Commands to take Care and send such Persons as will support her and her Government I therefore recommend to you Sir  Ed E  y  and Mr  A  h  as fit Members I shall take further Inspection than you imagine therefore remember  c  What sort of Churchmen these are the B  recommends is well known  We have an Account from  Cheshire  that Sir  George Warburton  and Mr  Offley  who stand Candidates for that County have had a Rencounter and are both wounded  May th  WE have an Account of a pretty many Elections since my last but Fortune has favoured the wrong side for Mr  Nevile  has carried it at  Abingdon  against Sir  Simon Harcourt  by odd Voices At  Ailsbury    Simon Mayne    Esq  against  Simon Harcourt    Clerk of the Crown  At  Wallingford  Mr  Kent  against Mr  Renda  At  Colchester  Mr  Bullock  against Sir  Tho Cook  At  Wendover  Sir  Roger Hill  against Sir  Richard Crawley  At  Rochester  Mr  Knatchbull  has lost it as has Mr  Randyl  at  Guilford  On the other Hand Mr  Gape  has carried it at St  Albans  notwithstanding a great  Lady  went down thither to oppose him whose Endeavours it is hoped will no better succeed at  Woodstock  in Favour of Brigadier  Cadoggan  an  Irishman  The County City and University of  Oxford  have elected their old  Tacking  Members  May th  SInce my Last we have an Account of a great many Elections some of which have gone  well  but more  ill  Five  honest Tackers  have lost it in  Kent  and two at  Haslemere  in  Surry  and one in  Westminster  On the other Hand the Honourable  Charles North    Esq  has carried it at  Banbury  the  Greviles  at  Warwick  and for the County of  Suffolk  the  Earl of Dysert  and Sir  Rob Davers  where there has been such a Trial of the Strength of Parties that the like has hardly been known The Poll ended on  Wednesday  Night when 'twas found that Sir  Rob Davers  had the  Earl of Dysert  Sir  Dudley Cullum  Sir  Sam Bernardiston  Voices so that the Election was carried by a great Majority if you consider the terrible Opposition that was made by the  LowChurch men  and their Friends the  Phanaticks  of all sorts supported by the  D  of  G  n  the Lords  Cor  llis  and  H  y  But this Victory is owing in a great Measure to the Diligence of the  Clergy  of which went and polled in one Body and as many singly being not advertiz'd of the Design and to pin the Basket Sir  Tho Hanmer  brought in a Body of Horse at the Sight of which the D  withdrew from the Window and all was given up and though the great Cry of the  Whigs  was  and is no  Tackers  yet that is known to be only the Word that is given out to the Party the true Meaning is  No Church of England Man  For we find that they have oppos'd Sir  Simon Harcourt  and others that had not the  Honour  to be of that Number with the same Violence and Sir  Will Ash  t  in a Letter to his Friend at  Warrington  tells him plainly that it's past a Clock with the Church so that she must come down At these Proceedings the inferiour Clergy are so alarm'd in  Cheshire  that they design to appear in a Body for Sir  R Motyn  and Sir  G Warburton  the late Representatives for that County and in  Essex  for Sir  Charles Barrington  and Sir  R Child  Dr  Oats  is gone to Poll at  Woodstock  for Brigadier  Cadoggan  of which Place he is a Burgess  May th  SInce my last a great many more Elections are made which are too long for my Purpose to enumerate Brigadier  Cadoggan  has carried it at  Woodstock  against Sir  John Waters  a very worthy Gentleman but Dr  Oats  did not go to give his Vote as was said he would nor did the  Solicitor General  tho' he had also a Right so to do The Lord  Woodstock  Son of the  Earl of Portland  has carried it at  Southampton  against  Frid Tilney    Esq  a loyal and worthy Gentleman which was done by this Trick That Gentleman happening to pay his Reckoning in that Town with about  Loudores  which he had received there the  Whig  Party immediately gave out he was a  French Pensioner  which Calumny answered their Purpose  A great Sum of Money has been spent at  Newcastle under Line  by Mr  Offley  and Mr  Lawton  the latter  BrotherinLaw to my Lord  Hallifax  to get in Burgesses there but Sir  Tho Bellot  and Mr  Cotton  have carried it and the chief Reason for their succeeding was the Assurances they gave their Electors of their firm Adhesion to the  Church  in this Day of  Danger  The Report we had of a Rencounter which happen'd in  Cheshire  between Sir  G Warburton  and Mr  Offley  proves not true Yesterday commenc'd the Election for the City of  London  and the four Whig Candidates were declared to have the Majority upon View and are like to carry it upon the Poll  May th  WE have an Account of a great many more Elections made since my last and upon the whole a sort of an Equilibrium seems to be between the Parties near of the  Tackers  are already chosen In  Essex  Sir  Ch Barrington  and Sir  R Child  have lost it by a great Majority tho' they poll'd more Freeholders than in former Elections but the  Whigs  have found a way of granting quit Rents of Shillings  per Annum  resignable upon the Tender of Six Pence Besides the  Quakers  in general throughout the Kingdom in this Election Vote against the  Church  The Poll in  London  runs still in Favour of the four  Whigs  and their Election will be declared this Evening  May th  YEsterday our Letters from the several Parts of the Kingdom brought an Account of a great many more Elections that are made and particularly for the  County of  Gloucester  Col  Colchester  and Sir  John Guise  have carried it against the Honourable  John How  and Sir  Ralph Dutton  Bar' For  Warwickshire  the old Representatives Sir  Ch Shuckburgh  and Sir  John Mordaunt  the last a  Tacker  have carried it being set up by the general Consent of the Gentry of that County One Captain  Lucy  supported by the Assistance of three or four Gentlemen and the Assistance of all the  Dissenters  attempted to have come in but was very much distanced as you will see by their Numbers on the Poll Sir  Ch Shuckburgh  Sir  John Mordaunt  Cap  Lucy  The Bishop of  Worcester  refused the latter his Interest upon Application to his Lordship by Reason a  Fanatick Preacher  is kept in his Family  The  Welch  Elections are not yet made but we may guess how they will be by the Loyal Health that is amongst them  viz  He that owns with his Heart and helps with his Hand  The Church that's establish'd by the Law of the Land  Conforming for Conscience and not on Occasion  Not eluding the Law by a knavish Evasion  Not melted thro' Favour nor frozen thro' Fear  By the Smiles of the Court or the Frowns of a Peer  But boldly maintains his Religion and Right  Dares die for the one for the other dares fight  This is the Man and this alone  Whose Health now I drink whose Friendship I own  Nor are the  Cornish  Elections yet made by Reason by a  Trick  or  Manage  the Writ has been delayed Sir  R Vivian  has had the Misfortune to break his Leg however the Gentlemen of the County labour to support his Interest against Mr  Boscawen  On  Thursday  last came on the much contested Election for the  University of Cambridge  The Candidates were the Honourable  Arthur Annesly    Esq  late Fellow of  Magdalen  Colledge who had Voices and the Honourable  Dixey Windsor    Esq  Fellow of  Trinity  Colledge who had opposed by  Fr Godolphin    Esq  my  Lord Treasurer  's Son who had Voices and Sir  Isaac Newton  a late made Knight who had Notwithstanding there was all the Management and Delay possible and the Heads of the Houses against the two first yet 'twas carried for them to the unspeakable Joy of the hopeful and promising Part of the University by which we may see that the Sense of  both Universities  was for the  Occasional Bill  and that they approved of the  tacking it  by choosing the same Members that joyned in it  I hear the Poll at  Woodstock  will be printed that it may be seen who they were that Poll'd for the  Brigadier  whose GrandFather was Governour of  Trim  in  Ireland  for the  Parliament  and his GrandMother was Daughter to the famous Sir  Hardress Waller  On his Father's Side his Pedigree was proved by an Epitaph that was made last Summer by one at the Herald Office and was never yet upon a Tomb  May d  YEsterday we had an Account of a great many more Elections that have been made since my last which for the most part have been in Favour of the  Church Interest  and particularly Sir  R Middleton  Bar' is elected for the County of  Denbigh  and  Will Robinson    Esq  for the Burrough of that Name they having rejected Mr  Brereton  One of the Commissioners  of Prizes by Reason he was not a  Tacker  Mr  Sacheverel  met with terrible Opposition from the  Whig  Party at  Nottingham  which were supported by the  D  of  N  the Lords  K  ton  and  H  w  however he carried it by a considerable Majority and they got him into the Chair before eleven at which the  Whigs  look'd so simply as tho' 'twas past Twelve with them The Management of this Victory was due in a great measure to the Neighbouring Gentry and in a more particular manner to that honourable Gentleman Sir  Tho Willoughby  who has carried divers other Elections which he has been at with equal Success as  Newark    Retford  and  Leicester  and on  Wednesday  the d is to be the Election for the County of  Nottingham  where Sir  Thomas  and Mr  Thornihagh  are like to carry it without Opposition  Sir  Justinian Isham  and Mr  Cartwright  are rechosen for the County of  Northampton  by a Majority of Freeholders tho' they were strenuously opposed by my Lord  Mordaunt  who 'tis said spent  l  and Sir  Andrew St John  Sir  Will Drake  a brave  Tacker  is chosen at  Honiton  with Sir  Walter Young whom the Electors made promise to be one upon Occasion  Sir  John Elwill  was vastly distanced The two first were met and ushered into Town by above Gentlemen on Horseback all wearing a  Golden Tacker  in their Hats The same Day Mr  Reynell  and Mr  Yard  two loyal Gentlemen carried it at  Ashburton  against Sir  John Elvil  and  his Son  The two loyal  Sons of the Church and Tackers    Nath  and  Fred Hern  Esquires were unanimously rechosen at  Dartmouth  and Sir  Hump Mackworth  with Mr  Coulson  at  Totnes  so that the Word  Tacker  which the  Phanaticks  thought to have made a  Bugbear  amongst the Freeholders and other Electors proves in most Places a  Badge of Honour  that recommends those Gentlemen to them and we see some great Men that  trimmed  or  sneaked  in the last  Parliament  upon that Account are not like to have the Honour to sit in the next  May th  YEsterday we had an Account of a great many more Elections made since my last and on  Saturday  last ended that for  Lancashire  The Candidates were the Honourable Mr  Stanly  Brother to the Lord  Derby  Sir  Roger Bradshaigh  Bar' and Mr  Shuttleworth  The two first were set up by the  Papists  and  Presbyterians  the third by the  Church of England  and a Majority was declared for Mr  Stanley  and Mr  Shuttleworth  to the great Mortification of the  Whigs  who have endeavoured by all means to eject the latter The  Church  had so much the better at this Election that Mr  Shuttleworth  left unpoll'd and Sir  R Bradshaigh  had only Sir  Richard How  and Mr  Hyde  have carried it for the County of  Wilts  by a great Majority  May th  SInce my last we have received an Account of a great many Elections and particularly from  Cornwall  where by the Interest and Endeavours of the new  Lord Lieutenant  of that County and of the  B  of  E  a great many Alterations are made in Favour of the Party that oppose the  Occasional Bill  or for  Low Church  But in  Wiltshire  it fared better with those two  Loyal Churchmen that the B opposed for they carried it by a Majority of against the  Occasional  men or  W  s  and the inferiour  Clergy  notwithstanding the menacing Letter sent them voted for the best  Churchmen  In  Kent  the Lord  Villars  and Sir  Cholmely Deering  have carried it for that County in Opposition to Sir  R Austin  and Mr  Colepeper  by a considerable Majority Sir  John Packington  has carried it for  Worcestershire  and the two old  Tackers  for  Coventry  Upon the whole the best Judgment that can be given is we may have a  Court Parliament  but 'twill not be a  Whig  One  May th  SInce my last we have had an Account of several Elections which I leave to the  Gazette  to enumerate only the Management of some of them is worth Notice particularly for the County of  Worcester  where Sir  John Packington  and Mr  Bromley  carried it gloriously against Mr  Walsh  who was set up by the  Dissenters  Sir  John Packington  had a  Banner  carried before him whereon was painted a  Church falling  with this Inscription  For the Queen and Church    Packington  'Twas observable that as they were marching through the Foregate Street they met the  Bishop  's Coach in which was a  NonConTeacher  going to Poll for Cap  Walsh  but the Horses at the Sight of the  Church  as 'twas believed turned Tail overturned and broke the same and very much bruised the  Holderforth  's OutwardMan and this raised no small Admiration that the Bishop's Horses should be afraid of a  Church  For the County of  Chester  the Honourable Mr  Booth  and  Crew Offley    Esq  set up by the  Whig  Interest have carried it by a vast Majority against Sir  Roger Mostyn  and Sir  George Warburton  the two late Representatives for that County although the two latter poll'd more than at the former Election and had all the  Clergy  and the Body of the  Gentry  on their Side but this Conquest was wholly owing to above a thousand defeasable Freeholders that Party had made against the Election which is a new and scandalous Practice and if the next Parliament do not enquire into it and put a Stop to it the whole Constitution will be subverted The Cry of the  Whig Rabble  during this Election was  Down with the Church and the Bishops  and when about of the  Clergy  headed by the  Dean  came to Poll they said  Hell was broke loose and these were the Devil's black Guard  They abused the Bishop tho' according to his peaceable Temper he did not intermeddle in the Election and to compleat their Outrage broke the Windows of the Cathedral and another Church  Yesterday was the Election for  Middlesex  the Candidates were the two old Members opposed by Sir  John Wolstenham  and Mr  Barker  supported by the  Whig  Interest and the latter carried it by a Majority of the highest of them polling about which is some Hundreds more than ever were polled at any Election in this small County and this Multiplication of Freeholders is wholly owing to the new method  May st  SInce my last we have an Account of some more Elections but nothing so very material has happen'd  at them as at that for  Sussex  The HighSheriff  Turner  Esq  refused to take the Poll unless the D  of  S  removed out of the Court which he obliged him to do after some high Words had passed the HighSheriff producing a Vote of the  House of Commons  against  Peers  intermedling in Elections which however they have done more in the Electing this  Parliament  than ever The  Quakers  in  Buckinghamshire  have Voted all of them against my Lord  Cheney  tho' he was the Person that brought in and procured the Bill in their Favour about the signing a Declaration instead of an Oath at  Brentford  several Hundreds of them Poll'd against  Smithson  and  Lake  as they have done against the  Church Interest  all  England  over which no doubt will be remembred and placed to their Accounts in Bar of future Favour  June d  WE have an Account of several  Tackers  more that are chosen since my last of which Number are Sir  Edward Seymor  and Mr  Snell  who carried it without Opposition at  Exeter  tho' Endeavours were used to have brought in a  Gentleman  that lately lost it at  Cambridge  but that loyal City would not be put upon with the University's Refuse In some Copies  Leavings  was first written but that not being thought severe enough was erased yet not so but still to remain legible and the Word Refuse written above it  June th  THE Election for Knights of the Shire for  Somerset  runs thus  Nath Palmer    Esq  Voices  John Piggot    Esq    George Worner    Esq    Francis  Lord  Hawley    The Letter of  June  th mentions nothing of Elections  June th  YEsterday we had an Account of the Election for  Devonshire  which was made on  Tuesday  last where the Honourable Sir  Will Courtenay  Bar' and  Robert Rolle    Esq  both loyal and stanch Churchmen  were unanimously reelected to serve for that County so that as the first Burrough  viz Malden  begun with the Election of two brave  Tackers  so the last County ended with the like Choice  The Election for Knights of the Shire for  Northumberland  was commenced on  Thursday  the last of  May  The Candidates were Sir  John Delavall  Bar' Sir  Fran Blake  Kt and  Tho Foster    Esq  Jun' and tho' the two first were supported with the Interest of the D  of  S  t  the E  of  C  le  and the Lord  G  y  in Person and all the  Whigs  in the County by Promises and Threats and the last only by the  Clergy  and  true Churchmen  yet he carried it for one by a great Majority as you'll see by the Poll  viz Foster  Sir  John Delaval  Sir  Francis Blake  Besides the first had Freeholders more that were ready to have Poll'd but the Knights threw up  No doubt but this House of Commons the Major Part of them being  Churchmen  will remember and  gratify the  Quakers  for the Service they have done them in this Election by supporting their Marriages by a Law and easing them from the Payment of small Tithes which is that they aim at as appears by the circular Letters sent by the Heads of them to their Friends in the Country directing them how to Vote  June th  THE Election for Members of  Parliament  is now over and 'tis found that there are new Members chosen that were not in the last House of Commons and of the  Tackers  and left out near a Moiety of which did not now stand Upon the whole both Parties seem pretty well pleased each fancying the Majority is on their Side  The  Bristol  Election of which we had an Account but Yesterday is gone for the old Members Mr  Colestone  Nephew to a Gentleman of that Name who had given a Charity to that City of  l  lost it by Voices those Ingrates crying out  No Almshouseman no HighChurch man no Jacobite  c  AN APPENDIX CONTAINING A Few of Mr  Dyer  's scandalous Observations and Reflections in some of his late Letters upon Matters of a Publick Concern  London June d  MOnday  next being theDay for the annual Election of  Sheriffs  for  London  and  Middlesex  the Sheriff making Party Design to put up Sir  Charles Thorold  and  Sam Stannier  Esq They are always for securing that Point not knowing what Occasion they may have for  Ignoramus's    June th  SIR  Ch Thorold  and  Sam Stannier    Esq  were elected Sheriffs for  London  and  Middlesex  for the Year ensuing There was scarce any Body appeared at the CommonHall but the Party that put them up the  Churchmen  finding which way the Stream must go are  passively obedient  July th  A New Book is come out of  d  Price entitled  A Memorial of the Church of England humbly offer'd to the Consideration of all true Lovers of our Church and Constitution  the same is an  exeraordinary Piece  and shews the Drift and Intrigues of  Primier M  r  and others and the languishing State the C  is now in  July th  THE Messenger of the Press is order'd to make a Discovery if possible of the Author Printer and Publisher of the Book entitled  A Memorial of the Church of England  which gives great Offence at C  but the swarm of  Libels  on the other hand pass with a sort of Priviledge as  the History of the Court of Poland  and others  July st  THE  Manifesto  of the  Church of England  that was endeavoured to be supprest is now again sold publickly about the Streets the  Bookseller  being resolved to take the Benefit of his Copy and stand the Test of the  Law  and the pretended Remarks that are printed with it strengthen and not confute the Assertions of the Author  July st  WE have an Account from the Assises at  Maidstone  that the  Soldier  belonging to  Shereness  Fort that  bastinadoed  to  Death  one  Machleman  a  Whig  and  trusty Pedlar  was condemned to die for the same but the  Major  who 'tis pretended hired him for half a Crown was cleared by the  Jury  contrary to the Directions of my  Lord Chief Justice    The Same was a mighty PartyCause  Aug d  WE have an Account from the late Assises at  Horsham  in  Sussex  that the  Clergy  of that County in a full Body making upwards of waited on  Arthur Turner    Esq  the  High Sheriff  and in a solemn Manner gave him their Thanks for standing up for the  Interest of the Church  in the late Election and for vindicating the Rights of the  Commons  in not permitting  a great Lord  to be present at taking the Poll for Knights of the Shire The  Grand Jury  for the County returned the  High Sheriff  the like Thanks and were both magnificently treated by him  Sept st  THE two Sheriffs have waited on Dr  Willis  with the Thanks of the  Lord Mayor  and  Court of Aldermen  for the  Sermon  he preached before the  Queen  at St  Paul  's on the late  Thanksgiving Day  though at the same time I hear that  Sermon  is variously reflected upon and will hardly escape without an Answer  it  containing very hard Reflections on the main Body of the Church of England  A  Vindication  is come out of the  Memorial of the Church of England  when at the same time the Grand Juries of  London  and  Middlesex  this present  Sessions  have presented the same as a dangerous  Libel  but that is no wonder if we consider the Juries and who return them  Sept th  THE G  J  of  London  that presented the  Memorial  were ten of them  Dissenters  and only two of the Pannel  Churchmen  who refused to sign the said  Presentment  Sept th  AN  Elegy  is come out upon the  famous Atchievement  of burning the  Church of England  's  Memorial  last Sessions at the  Old Baily  Sept d  THIS Morning came on the Election of a  President  for  BridewellHospital  and the two Aldermen which had the Majority of Voices the whole Court having been put up seriatim were Sir  Thomas Rawlinson  and Sir  John Hublon  and tho' the first had the latter but yet my  Lord Mayor  who presided would not declare the first Elected but raised a Scruple that all the Electors which he called Governours  were not Freemen and therefore he would refer it to the  Court of Aldermen  at which Innovation they very much complained as well as of some other Tricks that were shewn them  FINIS
