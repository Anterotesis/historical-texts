 Lud Du Guernier inv et sculp  THE FAIR PENITENT A TRAGEDY  Written by  N ROWE    Esq  Quin morere ut merita es ferroque averte dolorem  Virg Aen Lib  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  at  Shakespear  's  Head  overagainst  Catherinestreet  in the  Strand  MDCCXIV  TO HER GRACE the DUTCHESS OF  ORMOND  MADAM  _THE Privilege of Poetry or it may be the Vanity of the Pretenders to it has given 'em a kind of Right to pretend at the same time to the Favour of those whom  their high Birth and excellent Qualities have plac'd in a very distinguishing manner above the rest of the World If this be not a receiv'd Maxim yet I am sure I am to wish it were that I may have at least some kind of Excuse for laying this Tragedy at Your Grace's Feet I have too much reason to fear that it may prove but an indifferent Entertainment to Your Grace since if I have any way succeeded in it it has been in describing those violent Passions which have been always Strangers to so happy a Temper and so noble and so exalted a Virtue as Your Grace is Mistress of Yet for all this I cannot but confess the Vanity which I have to hope that there may be something so moving in the Misfortunes and Distress of the Play as may be not altogether unworthy of Your Grace's Pity This is one of the main Designs of Tragedy and to  excite this generous Pity in the greatest Minds may pass for some kind of Success in this way of Writing I am sensible of the Presumption I am guilty of by this Hope and how much it is that I pretend to in Your Grace's Approbation if it be my good Fortune to meet with any little Share of it I shall always look upon it as much more to me than the general Applause of the Theatre or even the Praise of a good Critick Your Grace's Name is the best Protection this Play can hope for since the World illnatur'd as it is agrees in an universal Respect and Deference for Your Grace's Person and Character In so censorious an Age as this is where Malice furnishes out all the Publick Conversations where every Body pulls and is pull'd to pieces of course and where there is hardly such a thing as being merry but at another's Expence yet by a  publick and uncommon Justice to the Dutchess of  Ormond  Her Name has never been mention'd but as it ought tho' She has Beauty enough to provoke Detraction from the Fairest of Her own Sex and Virtue enough to make the Loose and Dissolute of the other a very formidable Party Her Enemies Instead of this they agree to say nothing of Her but what She deserves That Her Spirit is worthy of Her Birth Her Sweetness of the Love and Respect of all the World Her Piety of Her Religion Her Service of Her Royal Mistress and Her Beauty and Truth of Her Lord that in short every part of Her Character is Just and that She is the best Reward for one of the greatest Hero's this Age has produc'd This Madam is what You must allow People every where to say those whom You shall leave behind You in  England  will have something further to  add the Loss we shall suffer by your Grace's Journey to  Ireland  the Queen's Pleasure and the Impatient Wishes of that Nation are about to deprive us of Two of our Publick Ornaments But there is no arguing against Reasons so prevalent as these Those who shall lament your Grace's Absence will yet acquiesce in the Wisdom and Justice of Her Majesty's Choice Among all whose Royal Favours none cou'd be so agreeable upon a thousand Accounts to that People as the Duke of  Ormond  With what Joy what Acclamations shall they meet a Governor who beside their former Obligations to His Family has so lately ventur'd His Life and Fortune for their Preservation What Duty what Submission shall they not pay to that Authority which the Queen has delegated to a Person so dear to 'em And with what Honour what Respect shall they receive Your Grace when they look  upon You as the Noblest and Best Pattern Her Majesty cou'd send 'em of her own Royal Goodness and Personal Virtues They shall behold Your Grace with the same Pleasure the  English  shall take when ever it shall be their good Fortune to see You return again to Your Native Country In  England  Your Grace is become a Publick Concern and as Your going away will be attended with a general Sorrow so Your Return shall give as general a Joy and to none of those many more than to  MADAM  Your GRACE's most Obedient and most Humble Servant  N Rowe  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr  Betterton  LONG has the Fate of Kings and Empires been  The common Business of the Tragick Scene  As if Misfortune made the Throne her Seat  And none cou d be unhappy but the Great  Dearly 'tis true each buys the Crown he wears  And many are the mighty Monarch's Cares  By foreign Foes and homebred Factions prest  Few are the Joys he knows and short his Hours of Rest  Stories like these with Wonder we may hear  But far remote and in a higher Sphere  We ne'er can pity what we ne'er can share  Like distant Battles of the  Pole  and  Swede  Which frugal Citizens o'er Coffee read  Careless for who shall fail or who succeed  Therefore an humbler Theme our Author chose  A melancholy Tale of private Woes  No Princes here lost Royalty bemoan  But you shall meet with Sorrows like your own  Here see imperious Love his Vassals treat  As hardly as Ambition does the Great  See how succeeding Passions rage by turns  How fierce the Youth with Joy and Rapture burns  And how to Death for Beauty lost he mourns  Let no nice Taste the Poet's Art arraign  If some frail vicious Characters he feign  Who Writes shou'd still let Nature be his Care  Mix Shades with Lights and not paint all things fair  But shew you Men and Women as they are  With Deference to the Fair he bad me say  Few to Perfection ever found the Way  Many in many Parts are known t' excel  But 'twere too hard for One to act all well  Whom justly Life should through each Scene commend  The Maid the Wife the Mistress and the Friend  This Age 'tis true has one great Instance seen  And Heav'n in Justice made that One a Queen  Dramatis Personae  MEN  SCiolto  a Nobleman of  Genoa  Father to  Calista  Mr  Bowman  Altamont  a young Lord in Love with  Calista  and design'd her Husband by  Sciolto  Mr  Verbruggen

GENOA  THE  FAIR PENITENT  ACT I SCENE I  SCENE a Garden belonging to  Sciolto's  Palace  Enter  Altamont  and  Horatio  ALTAMONT  _LET this auspicious Day be ever sacred  No Mourning no Misfortunes happen on it  Let it be markt for Triumphs and Rejoycings  Let happy Lovers ever make it hely  Chuse it to bless their Hopes and crown their Wishes  This happy Day that gives me my  Calista  Hor  Yes  Altamont  to Day thy better Stars  Are join'd to shed their kindest Influence on thee  Sciolto  's noble Hand that rais'd thee first  Half dead and drooping o'er thy Father's Grave  Compleats its Bounty and restores thy Name  To that high Rank and Lustre which it boasted  Before ungrateful  Genoa  had forgot  The Merit of thy Godlike Father's Arms  Before that Country which he long had serv'd  In watchful Councils and in Winter Camps  Had cast off his white Age to Want and Wretchedness  And made their Court to faction by his Ruin  Alt  Oh great  Sciolto  oh my more than Father  Let me not live but at thy very Name  My eager Heart springs up and leaps with Joy  When I forget the vast vast Debt I owe thee  Forget but 'tis impossible then let me  Forget the Use and Privilege of Reason  Be driven from the Commerce of Mankind  To wander in the Desart among Brutes  To bear the various Fury of the Seasons  The Night's unwholsom Dew and Noonday's Heat  To be the Scorn of Earth and Curse of Heav'n  Hor  So open so unbounded was his Goodness  It reach'd ev'n me because I was thy Friend  When that Great Man I lov'd thy Noble Father  Bequeath'd thy gentle Sister to my Arms  His last dear Pledge and Legacy of Friendship  That happy Tye made me  Sciolto  's Son  He call'd us his and with a Parent's Fondness  Indulg'd us in his Wealth blest us with Plenty  Heal'd all our Cares and sweeten'd Love it self  Alt  By Heav'n he found my Fortunes so abandon'd  That nothing but a Miracle could raise 'em  My Father's Bounty and the State's Ingratitude  Had strip'd him bare nor left him ev'n a Grave  Undone my self and sinking with his Ruin  I had no Wealth to bring nothing to succour him  But fruitless Tears  Hor  Yet what thou cou'dst thou didst  And didst it like a Son when his hard Creditors  Urg'd and assisted by  Lothario  's Father  Foe to thy House and Rival of their Greatness  By Sentence of the cruel Law forbid  His venerable Corps to rest in Earth  Thou gav'st thy self a Ransom for his Bones  With Piety uncommon didst give up  Thy hopeful Youth to Slaves who ne'er knew Mercy  Sour unrelenting Monyloving Villains  Who laugh at human Nature and Forgiveness  And are like Fiends the Factors for Destruction  Heav'n who beheld the pious Act approv'd it  And bad  Sciolto  's Bounty be its Proxy  To bless thy filial Virtue with Abundance  Alt  But see he comes the Author of my Happiness  The Man who sav'd my Life from deadly Sorrow  Who bids my Days be blest with Peace and Plenty  And satisfies my Soul with Love and Beauty  Enter  Sciolto  he runs to  Altamont  and embraces him  Sci  Joy to thee  Altamont  Joy to my self  Joy to this happy Morn that makes thee mine  That kindly grants what Nature had deny'd me  And makes me Father of a Son like thee  Alt  My Father oh let me unlade my Breast  Pour out the fullness of my Soul before you  Show ev'ry tender ev'ry grateful Thought  This wond'rous Goodness stirs But 'tis impossible  And Utterance all is vile since I can only  Swear you reign here but never tell how much  Sci  It is enough I know thee thou art honest  Goodness innate and Worth hereditary  Are in thy Mind thy noble Father's Virtues  Spring freshly forth and blossom in thy Youth  Alt  Thus Heav'n from nothing rais'd his fair Creation  And then with wond'rous Joy beheld its Beauty  Well pleas'd to see the Excellence he gave  Sci  Oh noble Youth I swear since first I knew thee  Ev'n from that day of Sorrows when I saw thee  Adorn'd and lovely in thy filial Tears  The Mourner and Redeemer of thy Father  I set thee down and seal'd thee for my own  Thou art my Son ev'n near me as  Calista  Horatio  and  Lavinia  too are mine  Embraces  Horatio  All are my Children and shall share my Heart  But wherefore waste we thus this happy Day  The laughing Minutes summon thee to Joy  And with new Pleasures court thee as they pass  Thy waiting Bride ev'n chides thee for delaying  And swears thou com'st not with a Bridegroom's Haste  Alt  Oh could I hope there was one Thought of  Altamont  One kind Remembrance in  Calista  's Breast  The Winds with all their Wings would be too slow  To bear me to her Feet For oh my Father  Amidst this Stream of Joy that bears me on  Blest as I am and honour'd in your Friendship  There is one Pain that hangs upon my Heart  Sci  What means my Son  Alt  When at your Intercession  Last Night  Calista  yielded to my Happiness  Just ere we parted as I seal'd my Vows  With Rapture on her Lips I found her Cold  As a dead Lover's Statue on his Tomb  A rising storm of Passion shook her Breast  Her Eyes a piteous show'r of Tears let fall  And then she sigh'd as if her Heart were breaking  With all the tend'rest Eloquence of Love  I beg'd to be a Sharer in her Grief  But she with Looks averse and Eyes that froze me  Sadly reply'd her Sorrows were her own  Nor in a Father's Pow'r to dispose of  Sci  Away it is the Cosenage of their Sex  One of the common Arts they practise on us  To sigh and weep then when their Hearts beat high  With expectation of the coming Joy  Thou hast in Camps and fighting Fields been bred  Unknowing in the Subtleties of Women  The Virgin Bride who swoons with deadly Fear  To see the end of all her Wishes near  When blushing from the Light and publick Eyes  To the kind Covert of the Night she flies  With equal Fires to meet the Bridegroom moves  Melts in his Arms and with a loose she loves  Exeunt  Enter  Lothario  and  Rossano  Loth  The Father and the Husband  Ross  Let them pass  They saw us not  Loth  I care not if they did  Ere long I mean to meet 'em Face to Face  And gaul 'em with my Triumph o'er  Calista  Ross  You lov'd her once  Loth  I lik'd her wou'd have marry'd her  But that it pleas'd her Father to refuse me  To make this Honourable Fool her Husband  For which if I forget him may the Shame  I mean to brand his Name with stick on mine  Ross  She gentle Soul was kinder than her Father  Loth  She was and oft in private gave me hearing  'Till by long list'ning to the soothing Tale  At length her easie Heart was wholly mine  Ross  I have heard you oft describe her Haughty Insolent  And fierce with high Disdain it moves my wonder  That Virtue thus defended should be yielded  A Prey to loose Desires  Loth  Hear then I'll tell thee  Once in a lone and secret Hour of Night  When ev'ry Eye was clos'd and the pale Moon  And Stars alone shone conscious of the Theft  Hot with the  Tuscan  Grape and high in Blood  Hap'ly I stole unheeded to her Chamber  Ross  That Minute sure was lucky  Loth  Oh 'twas great  I found the Fond Believing Lovesick Maid  Loose unattir'd warm tender full of Wishes  Fierceness and Pride the Guardians of her Honour  Were charm'd to Rest and Love alone was waking  Within her rising Bosom all was calm  As peaceful Seas that know no Storms and only  Are gently lifted up and down by Tides  I snatch'd the glorious golden Opportunity  And with prevailing youthful Ardour prest her  Till with short Sighs and murmuring Reluctance  The yielding Fair One gave me perfect Happiness  Ev'n all the livelong Night we past in Bliss  In Extasies too fierce to last for ever  At length the Morn and cold Indifference came  When fully sated with the luscious Banquet  I hastily took leave and left the Nymph  To think on what was past and sigh alone  Ross  You saw her soon again  Loth  Too soon I saw her  For oh that Meeting was not like the former  I found my Heart no more beat high with Transport  No more I sigh'd and languish'd for Enjoyment  'Twas past and Reason took her turn to reign  While ev'ry Weakness fell before her Throne  Ross  What of the Lady  Loth  With uneasie Fondness  She hung upon me wept and sigh'd and swore  She was undone talk'd of a Priest and Marriage  Of flying with me from her Father's Pow'r  Call'd ev'ry Saint and blessed Angel down  To witness for her that she was my Wife  I started at that Name  Ross  What Answer made you  Loth  None but pretending sudden Pain and Illness  Escap'd the Persecution two Nights since  By Message urg'd and frequent Importunity  Again I saw her Strait with Tears and Sighs  With swelling Breasts with Swooning with Distraction  With all the Subtleties and pow'rful Arts  Of wilful Woman lab'ring for her purpose  Again she told the same dull nauseous Tale  Unmov'd I beg'd her spare th'ungrateful Subject  Since I resolv'd that Love and Peace of Mind  Might flourish long inviolate betwixt us  Never to load it with the Marriage Chain  That I would still retain her in my Heart  My ever gentle Mistress and my Friend  But for those other Names of Wise and Husband  They only meant Illnature Cares and Quarrels  Ross  How bore she this Reply  Loth  Ev'n as the Earth  When Winds pent up or eating Fires beneath  Shaking the Mass she labours with Destruction  At first her Rage was dumb and wanted Words  But when the Storm found way 'twas wild and loud  Mad as the Priestess of the  Delphick  God  Enthusiastick Passion swell'd her Breast  Enlarg'd her Voice and ruffled all her Form  Proud and disdainful of the Love I proffer'd  She call'd me Villain Monster Base Betrayer  At last in very bitterness of Soul  With deadly Imprecations on her self  She vow'd severely ne'er to see me more  Then bid me fly that minute I obey'd  And bowing left her to grow cool at leisure  Ross  She has relented since else why this Message  To meet the Keeper of her Secrets here  This Morning  Loth  See the Person whom you nam'd  Enter  Lucilla  Well my Embassadress what must we treat of  Come you to menace War and proud Defiance  Or does the peaceful Olive grace your Message  Is your Fair Mistress calmer does she soften  And must we love again Perhaps she means  To treat in Juncture with her new Ally  And make her Husband Party to th' Agreement  Lucil  Is this well done my Lord Have you put off  All Sense of Human Nature keep a little  A little Pity to distinguish Manhood  Lest other Men tho' cruel should disclaim you  And judge you to be number'd with the Brutes  Loth  I see thou'st learnt to rail  Lucil  I've learnt to weep  That Lesson my sad Mistress often gives me  By Day she seeks some melancholy Shade  To hide her Sorrows from the prying World  At Night she watches all the long long Hours  And listens to the Winds and beating Rain  With Sighs as loud and Tears that fall as fast  Then ever and anon she wrings her Hands  And cries False false  Lothario  Loth  Oh no more  I swear thou'lt spoil thy pretty Face with Crying  And thou hast Beauty that may make thy Fortune  Some keeping Cardinal shall doat upon thee  And barter his Church Treasure for thy Freshness  Lucil  What shall I fell my Innocence and Youth  For Wealth or Titles to perfidious Man  To Man who makes his Mirth of our Undoing  The base profest Betrayer of our Sex  Let me grow old in all Misfortunes else  Rather than know the Sorrows of  Calista  Loth  Does she send thee to chide in her behalf  I swear thou dost it with so good a Grace  That I cou'd almost love thee for thy frowning  Lucil  Read there my Lord there in her own sad Lines  Giving a Letter  Which best can tell the Story of her woes  That Grief of Heart which your Unkindness gives her  Lothario  reads  Your CrueltyObedience to my Fathergive my Hand to  Altamont  By Heav'n 'tis well such ever be the Gifts  With which I greet the Man whom my Soul hates  Aside  But to go on  WishHeartHonourtoo faithlessWeaknessto morrowlast Troublelost Calista  Women I see change as well as Men  She writes me here forsaken as I am  That I should bind my Brows with mournful Willow  For she has given her Hand to  Altamont  Yet tell the Fair Inconstant  Lucil  How my Lord  Loth  Nay no more angry Words say to  Calista  The humblest of her Slaves shall wait her Pleasure  If she can leave her happy Husband's Arms  To think upon so lost a thing as I am  Lucil  Alas for pity come with gentler Looks  Wound not her Heart with this unmanly Triumph  And tho' you love her not yet swear you do  So shall Dissembling once be virtuous in you  Loth  Ha who comes here  Lucil  The Bridegroom's Friend  Horatio  He must not see us here to morrow early  Be at the Garden Gate  Loth  Bear to my Love  My kindest Thoughts and swear I will not fail her    Lothario  putting up the Letter hastily drops it as he goes out  Exeunt  Lothario  and  Rossano  one way  Lucilla  another  Enter  Horatio  Hor  Sure 'tis the very Error of my Eyes  Waking I dream or I beheld  Lothario  He seem'd conferring with  Calista  's Woman  At my approach they started and retir'd  What Business cou'd he have here and with her  I know he bears the noble  Altamont  Profest and deadly HateWhat Paper's this  Taking up the Letter  Ha to  Lothario  's Death  Calista  's Name  Opening it  Confusion and Misfortune  Reads  YOUR Cruelty has at length determin'd me and I have resolv'd this Morning to yield a perfect Obedience to my Father and to give my Hand to  Altamont  in spight of my Weakness for the false  Lothario  I could almost wish I had that Heart and that Honour to bestow with it which you have robb'd me of  Damnation to the rest  Reads again  But oh I fear could I retrieve 'em I should again be undone by the too faithless yet too lovely  Lothario  this is the last weakness of my Pen and to morrow shall be the last in which I will indulge my Eyes  Lucilla  shall conduct you if you are kind enough to let me see you it shall be the last Trouble you shall meet with from  The lost  Calista  The lost indeed for thou art gone as far  As there can be Perdition Fire and Sulphur  Hell is the sole Avenger of such Crimes  Oh that the Ruin were but all thy own  Thou wilt ev'n make thy Father curse his Age  At sight of this black Scrowl the gentle  Altamont  For oh I know his Heart is set upon thee  Shall droop and hang his discontented Head  Like Merit scorn'd by insolent Authority  And never grace the Publick with his Virtues  Perhaps ev'n now he gazes fondly on her  And thinking Soul and Body both alike  Blesses the perfect Wormanship of Heav'n  Then sighing to his ev'ry Care speaks Peace  And bids his Heart be satisfy'd with Happiness  Oh wretched Husband while she hangs about thee  With idle Blandishments and plays the fond one  Ev'n then her hot Imagination wanders  Contriving Riot and loose scapes of Love  And while she clasps thee close makes thee a Monster  What if I give this Paper to her Father  It follows that his Justice dooms her dead  And breaks his Heart with Sorrow hard Return  For all the Good his Hand has heap'd on us  Hold let me take a Moment's Thought  Enter  Lavinia  Lav  My Lord  Trust me it joys my Heart that I have found you  Enquiring wherefore you had left the Company  Before my Brother's Nuptial Rites were ended  They told me you had felt some sudden Illness  Where are you sick Is it your Head your Heart  Tell me my Love and ease my anxious Thoughts  That I may take you gently in my Arms  Sooth you to Rest and soften all your Pains  Hor  It were unjust no let me spare my Friend  Lock up the fatal Secret in my Breast  Nor tell him that which will undo his Quiet  Lav  What means my Lord  Hor  Ha saidst thou my  Lavinia  Lav  Alas you know not what you make me suffer  Why are you pale Why did you start and tremble  Whence is that Sigh And wherefore are your Eyes  Severely rais'd to Heav'n The sick Man thus  Acknowledging the Summons of his Fate  Lifts up his feeble Hands and Eyes for Mercy  And with Confusion thinks upon his Audit  Hor  Oh no thou hast mistook my Sickness quite  These Pangs are of the Soul Wou'd I had met  Sharpest Convulsions spotted Pestilences  Or any other deadly Foe to Life  Rather than heave beneath this load of Thought  Lav  Alas what is it Wherefore turn you from me  Why did you falsly call me your  Lavinia  And swear I was  Horatio  's better half  Since now you mourn unkindly by your self  And rob me of my Partnership of Sadness  Witness you Holy Pow'rs who know my Truth  There cannot be a Chance in Life so miserable  Nothing so very hard but I cou'd bear it  Much rather than my Love should treat me coldly  And use me like a Stranger to his Heart  Hor  Seek not to know what I wou'd hide from all  But most from thee I never knew a Pleasure  Ought that was joyful fortunate or good  But strait I ran to bless thee with the Tidings  And laid up all my Happiness with thee  But wherefore wherefore should I give thee Pain  Then spare me I conjure thee ask no further  Allow my melancholy Thoughts this privilege  And let 'em brood in secret o'er their Sorrows  Lav  It is enough chide not and all is well  Forgive me if I saw you sad  Horatio  And ask'd to weep out part of your Misfortunes  I wo'not press to know what you forbid me  Yet my lov'd Lord yet you must grant me this  Forget your Cares for this one happy Day  Devote this Day to Mirth and to your  Altamont  For his dear sake let Peace be in your Looks  Ev'n now the jocund Bridegroom wants your Wishes  He thinks the Priest has but half blest his Marriage  'Till his Friend Hails him with the sound of Joy  Hor  Oh never never never Thou art innocent  Simplicity from Ill pure native Truth  And Candour of the Mind adorn thee ever  But there are such such false ones in the World  'Twou'd fill thy gentle Soul wild Amazement  To hear their Story told  Lav  False ones my Lord  Hor  Fatally Fair they are and in their Smiles  The Graces little Loves and young Desires inhabit  But all that gaze upon 'em are undone  For they are false luxurious in their Appetites  And all the Heav'n they hope for is Variety  One Lover to another still succeeds  Another and another after that  And the last Fool is welcome as the former  'Till having lov'd his Hour out he gives place  And mingles with the Herd that went before him  Lav  Can there be such And have they peace of Mind  Have they in all the Series of their changing  One happy Hour if Women are such things  How was I form'd so different from my Sex  My little Heart is satisfy'd with you  You take up all her room as in a Cottage  Which harbours some Benighted Princely Stranger  Where the good Man proud of his Hospitality  Yields all his homely Dwelling to his Guest  And hardly keeps a Corner for himself  Hor  Oh were they all like thee Men would adore 'em  And all the Bus'ness of their Lives be loving  The Nuptial Band shou'd be the Pledge of Peace  And all Domestick Cares and Quarrels cease  The World shou'd learn to love by Virtuous Rules  And Marriage be no more the Jest of Fools  Exeunt  ACT II SCENE I  SCENE a Hall  Enter  Calista  and  Lucilla  Cal  BE dumb for ever silent as the Grave  Nor let thy fond officious Love disturb  My solemn Sadness with the sound of Joy  If thou wilt sooth me tell some dismal Tale  Of pining Discontent and black Despair  For oh I've gone around thro' all my Thoughts  But all are Indignation Love or Shame  And my dear Peace of Mind is lost for ever  Luc  Why do you follow still that wand'ring Fire  That has misled your weary Steps and leaves you  Benighted in a Wilderness of Woe  That false  Lothario  Turn from the Deceiver  Turn and behold where gentle  Altamont  Kind as the softest Virgin of our Sex  And faithful as the simple Village Swain  That never knew the Courtly Vice of Changing  Sighs at your Feet and wooes you to be happy  Cal  Away I think not of him My sad Soul  Has form'd a dismal melancholy Scene  Such a Retreat as I wou'd wish to find  An unfrequented Vale o'ergrown with Trees  Mossie and old within whose lonesome Shade  Ravens and Birds ill omen'd only dwell  No Sound to break the Silence but a Brook  That bubling wind's among the Weeds no Mark  Of any Human Shape that had been there  Unless a Skeleton of some poor Wretch  Who had long since like me by Love undone  Sought that sad Place out to despair and die in  Luc  Alas for Pity  Cal  There I fain wou'd hide me  From the base World from Malice and from Shame  For 'tis the solemn Counsel of my Soul  Never to live with publick Loss of Honour  'Tis fix'd to die rather than bear the Insolence  Of each affected She that tells my Story  And blesses her good Stars that she is virtuous  To be a Tale for Fools Scorn'd by the Women  And pity'd by the Men oh insupportable  Luc  Can you perceive the manifest Destruction  The gaping Gulf that opens just before you  And yet rush on tho' conscious of the Danger  Oh hear me hear your ever faithful Creature  By all the Good I wish by all the Ill  My trembling Heart forebodes let me intreat you  Never to see this faithless Man again  Let me forbid his coming  Cal  On thy Life  I charge thee no my Genius drives me on  I must I will behold him once again  Perhaps it is the Crisis of my Fate  And this one Enterview shall end my Cares  My lab'ring Heart that swells with Indignation  Heaves to discharge the Burthen that once done  The busie thing shall rest within its Cell  And never beat again  Luc  Trust not to that  Rage is the shortest Passion of our Souls  Like narrow Brooks that rise with sudden Show'rs  It swells in haste and falls again as soon  Still as it ebbs the softer Thoughts flow in  And the Deceiver Love supplies its place  Cal  I have been wrong'd enough to arm my Temper  Against the smooth Delusion but alas  Chide not my Weakness gentle Maid but pity me  A Woman's Softness hangs about me still  Then let me blush and tell thee all my Folly  I swear I could not see the dear Betrayer  Kneel at my Feet and sigh to be forgiven  But my relenting Heart would pardon all  And quite forget 'twas he that had undone me  Lucil  Ye sacred Powers whose gracious Providence  Is watchful for our Good guard me from Men  From their deceitful Tongues their Vows and Flatteries  Still let me pass neglected by their Eyes  Let my Bloom wither and my Form decay  That none may think it worth his while to ruin me  And fatal Love may never be my Bane  Cal  Ha  Altamont Calista  now be wary  And guard thy Soul's Accesses with Dissembling  Nor let this Hostile Husband's Eyes explore  The warring Passions and tumultuous Thoughts  That rage within thee and deform thy Reason  Enter  Altamont  Alt  Be gone my Cares I give you to the Winds  Far to be born far from the happy  Altamont  For from this sacred  Aera  of my Love  A better Order of succeeding Days  Come smiling forward white and lucky all  Calista  is the Mistress of the Year  She crowns the Seasons with auspicious Beauty  And bids ev'n all my Hours be good and joyful  Cal  If I was ever Mistress of such Happiness  Oh wherefore did I play th' unthrifty Fool  And wasting all on others leave my self  Without one Thought of Joy to give me Comfort  Alt  Oh mighty Love Shall that fair Face profane  This thy great Festival with Frowns and Sadness  I swear it sha' not be for I will wooe thee  With Sighs so moving with so warm a Transport  That thou shalt catch the gentle Flame from me  And kindle into Joy  Cal  I tell thee  Altamont  Such Hearts as ours were never pair'd above  Ill suited to each other join'd not match'd  Some sullen Influence a Foe to both  Has wrought this fatal Marriage to undo us  Mark but the Frame and Temper of our Minds  How very much we differ Ev'n this Day  That fills thee with such Extasie and Transport  To me brings nothing that should make me bless it  Or think it better than the Day before  Or any other in the Course of Time  That dully took its turn and was forgotten  Alt  If to behold thee as my Pledge of Happiness  To know none fail none excellent beside thee  If still to love thee with unweary'd Constancy  Through ev'ry Season ev'ry Change of Life  Through wrinkled Age through Sickness and Misfortune  Be worth the least Return of grateful Love  Oh then let my  Calista  bless this Day  And set it down for happy  Cal  'Tis the Day  In which my Father gave my Hand to  Altamont  As such I will remember it for ever  Enter  Sciolto    Horatio  and  Lavinia  Sci  Let Mirth go on let Pleasure know no pause  But fill up ev'ry Minute of this Day  'Tis yours my Children sacred to your Loves  The glorious Sun himself for you looks gay  He shines for  Altamont  and for  Calista  Let there be Musick let the Master touch  The sprightly String and softlybreathing Flute  'Till Harmony rouse ev'ry gentle Passion  Teach the cold Maid to lose her Fears in Love  And the fierce Youth to languish at her Feet  Begin ev'n Age it self is chear'd with Musick  It wakes a glad Remembrance of our Youth  Calls back past Joys and warms us into Transport  Here an Entertainment of Musick and Dancing  SONG  By Mr GONGREVE  I  AH stay ah turn ah whither would you fly  Too charming too relentless Maid  I follow not to Conquer but to Die  You of the fearful are afraid  II  In vain I call for

while all are here intent on Revelling  I privately went forth and sought  Lothario  This Letter may be forg'd perhaps the Wantonness  Of his vain Youth to stain a Lady's Fame  Perhaps his Malice to disturb my Friend  Oh no my Heart forebodes it must be true  Methought ev'n now I mark'd the starts of Guilt  That shook her Soul tho' damn'd Dissimulation  Skrcen'd her dark Thoughts and set to publick View  A specious Face of Innocence and Beauty  Oh false Appearance What is all our Soveraignty  Our boasted Pow'r when they oppose their Arts  Still they prevail and we are found their Fools  With such smooth Looks and many a gentle Word  The first fair She beguil'd her easie Lord  Too blind with Love and Beauty to beware  He fell unthinking in the fatal Snare  Nor could believe that such a Heav'nly Face  Had bargain'd with the Devil to damn her wretched Race  Exit  SCENE II  SCENE the Street near  Sciolto  's Palace  Enter  Lothario  and  Rossano  Loth  To tell thee then the Purport of my Thoughts  The Loss of this fond Paper would not give me  A moment of Disquiet were it not  My Instrument of Vengeance on this  Altamont  Therefore I mean to wait some Opportunity  Of speaking with the Maid we saw this Morning  Ross  I wish you Sir to think upon the Danger  Of being seen to Day their Friends are round 'em  And any Eye that lights by chance on you  Shall put your Life and Safety to the Hazard  They confer aside  Enter  Horatio  Hor  Still I must doubt some Mystery of Mischief  Some Artifice beneath  Lothario  's Father  I knew him well he was sagacious cunning  Fluent in Words and bold in peaceful Councils  But of a cold unactive hand in War  Yet with these Coward's Virtues he undid  My unsuspecting valiant honest Friend  This Son if Fame mistakes not is more hot  More open and unartfulHa he's here  Seeing him  Loth  Damnation He againThis second time  To Day he has crost me like my evil Genius  Hor  I sought you Sir  Loth  'Tis well then I am found  Hor  'Tis well you are The Man who wrongs my Friend  To the Earth's utmost Verge I would pursue  No Place tho' e'er so holy should protect him  No Shape that artful Fear e'er form'd should hide him  'Till he fair Answer made and did me Justice  Loth  Ha dost thou know me that I am  Lothario  As great a Name as this proud City boasts of  Who is this mighty Man then this  Horatio  That I should basely hide me from his Anger  Lest he should chide me for his Friend's Displeasure  Hor  The Brave 'tis true do never shun the Light  Just are their Thoughts and open are their Tempers  Freely without Disguise they love and hate  Still are they found in the fair face of Day  And Heav'n and Men are Judges of their Actions  Loth  Such let 'em be of mine there's not a Purpose  Which my Soul ever fram'd or my Hand acted  But I could well have bid the World look on  And what I once durst do have dar'd to justifie  Hor  Where was this open Boldness this free Spirit  When but this very Morning I surpriz'd thee  In base dishonest Privacy consulting  And bribing a poor mercenary Wretch  To sell her Lady's Secrets stain her Honour  And with a forg'd Contrivance blast her Virtue  At Sight of me thou fledst  Loth  Ha Fled from thee  Hor  Thou fled'st and Guilt was on thee like a Thief  A Pilferer descry'd in some dark Corner  Who there had lodg'd with mischievous Intent  To rob and ravage at the Hour of Rest  And do a Midnight Murder on the Sleepers  Loth  Slave Villain  Offers to draw  Rossano  holds him  Ross  Hold my Lord think where you are  Think how unsafe and hurtful to your Honour  It were to urge a Quarrel in this Place  And shock the peaceful City with a Broil  Loth  Then since thou dost provoke my Vengeance know  I wou'd not for this City's Wealth for all  Which the Sea wafts to our  Ligurian  Shoar  But that the Joys I reap'd with that fond Wanton  The Wife of  Altamont  shou'd be as publick  As is the Noonday Sun Air Earth or Water  Or any common Benefit of Nature  Think'st thou I meant the Shame shou'd be conceal'd  Oh no by Hell and Vengeance all I wanted  Was some fit Messenger to bear the News  To the dull doating Husband now I have found him  And thou art he  Hor  I hold thee base enough  To break through Law and spurn at Sacred Order  And do a brutal Injury like this  Yet mark me well young Lord I think  Calista  Too Nice too Noble and too Great of Soul  To be the Prey of such a Thing as thou art  'Twas base and poor unworthy of a Man  To forge a Scrowl so villanous and loose  And Mark it with a noble Lady's Name  These are the mean dishonest Arts of Cowards  Strangers to Manhood and to glorious Dangers  Who bred at Home in Idleness and Riot  Ransack for Mistresses th' unwholsome Stews  And never know the worth of virtuous Love  Loth  Think'st thou I forg'd the Letter Think so still  'Till the broad Shame comes staring in thy Face  And Boys shall hoot the Cuckold as he passes  Hor  Away no Woman cou'd descend so low  A skipping dancing worthless Tribe you are  Fit only for your selves you Herd together  And when the circling Glass warms your vain Hearts  You talk of Beauties that you never saw  And fancy Raptures that you never knew  Legends of Saints who never yet had Being  Or being ne'er were Saints are not so false  As the fond Tales which you recount of Love  Loth  But that I do not hold it worth my Leisure  I cou'd produce such damning Proof  Hor  'Tis false  You blast the Fair with Lies because they scorn you  Hate you like Age like Ugliness and Impotence  Rather than make you blest they wou'd die Virgins  And stop the Propagation of Mankind  Loth  It is the Curse of Fools to be secure  nd that be thine and  Altamont  's Dream on  or think upon my Vengeance 'till thou feel'st it  Hor  Hold Sir another Word and then farewel  Tho' I think greatly of  Calista  's Virtue  nd hold it far beyond thy Pow'r to hurt  Yet as she shares the Honour of my  Altamont  That Treasure of a Soldier bought with Blood  And kept at Life's Expence I must not have  Mark me young Sir her very Name prophan'd  Learn to restrain the Licence of your Speech  'Tis held you are too lavish when you are met  Among your Set of Fools talk of your Dress  Of Dice of Whores of Horses and your Selves  'Tis safer and becomes your Understandings  Loth  What if we pass beyond this solemn Order  And in Defiance of the stern  Horatio  Indulge our gayer Thoughts let Laughter loose  And use his sacred Friendship for our Mirth  Hor  'Tis well Sir you are pleasant  Loth  By the Joys  Which yet my Soul has uncontroll'd pursu'd  I wou'd not turn aside from my least Pleasure  Tho' all thy Force were arm'd to bar my Way  But like the Birds great Nature's happy Commoners  That haunt in Woods in Meads and flow'ry Gardens  Rifle the Sweets and taste the choicest Fruits  Yet scorn to ask the Lordly Owners leave  Hor  What Liberty has vain presumptuous Youth  That thou shou'dst dare provoke me unchastis'd  But henceforth Boy I warn thee shun my Walks  If in the Bounds of yon forbidden Place  Again thou'rt found expect a Punishment  Such as great Souls impatient of an Injury  Exact from those who wrong 'em much ev'n Death  Or something worse an injur'd Husband's Vengeance  Shall print a thousand Wounds tear thy fine Form  And scatter thee to all the Winds of Heav'n  Loth  Is then my Way in  Genoa  prescrib'd  By a Dependant on the wretched  Altamont  A talking Sir that brawls for him in Taverns  And vouches for his Valour's Reputation  Hor  Away thy Speech is fouler than thy Manners  Loth  Or if there be a Name more vile his Parasite  A Beggar's Parasite  Hor  Now learn Humanity  Offers to strike him  Rossano  interposes  Since Brutes and Boys are only taught with Blows  Loth  Damnation  They Draw  Ross  Hold this goes no further here  Horatio  'tis too much already see  The Crowd are gath'ring to us  Loth  Oh  Rossano  Or give me way or thou'rt no more my Friend  Ross  Sciolto  's Servants too have ta'en th' Alarm  You'll be opprest by Numbers be advis'd  Or I must force you hence take't on my Word  You shall have Justice done you on  Horatio  Put up my Lord  Loth  This wo' not brook Delay  West of the Town a Mile among the Rocks  Two Hours e'er Noon to morrow I expect thee  Thy single Hand to mine  Hor  I'll meet thee there  Loth  To morrow oh my better Stars to morrow  Exert your Influence shine strongly for me  'Tis not a common Conquest I wou'd gain  Since Love as well as Arms must grace my Triumph  Exeunt  Lothario  and  Rossano  Hor  Two Hours e'er Noon to morrow ha e'er that  He sees  Calista  oh unthinking Fool  What if I urg'd her with the Crime and Danger  If any Spark from Heav'n remain unquench'd  Within her Breast my Breath perhaps may wake it  Cou'd I but prosper there I wou'd not doubt  My Combat with that loud vainglorious Boaster  Were you ye Fair but cautious whom ye trust  Did you but think how seldom Fools are just  So many of your Sex wou'd not in vain  Of broken Vows and faithless Men complain  Of all the various Wretches Love has made  How few have been by Men of Sense betray'd  Convinc'd by Reason they your Pow'r confess  Pleas'd to he happy as you're pleas'd to bless  And conscious of your Worth can never love you less  Exit  ACT III SCENE I  SCENE an Apartment in  Sciolto  's Palace  Enter  Sciolto  and  Calista  Sci  NOW by my Life my Honour 'tis too much  Have I not mark'd thee wayward as thou art  Perverse and sullen all this Day of Joy  When ev'ry Heart was chear'd and Mirth went round  Sorrow Displeasure and repining Anguish  Sate on thy Brow like some malignant Planet  Foe to the Harvest and the healthy Year  Who scouls adverse and lours upon the World  When all the other Stars with gentle Aspect  Propitious shine and meaning Good to Man  Cal  Is then the Task of Duty half perform'd  Has not your Daughter giv'n her self to  Altamont  Yielded the native Freedom of her Will  To an Imperious Husband's lordly Rule  To gratifie a Father's stern Command  Sci  Dost thou complain  Cal  For pity do not frown then  If in despight of all my vow'd Obedience  A Sigh breaks out or a Tear falls by chance  For oh that Sorrow which has drawn your Anger  Is the sad Native of  Calista  's Breast  And once possest will never quit its Dwelling  'Till Life the Prop of all shall leave the Building  To tumble down and moulder into Ruin  Sci  Now by the sacred Dust of that dear Saint  That was thy Mother by her wond'rous Goodness  Her soft her tender most complying Sweetness  I swear some sullen Thought that shuns the Light  Lurks underneath that Sadness in thy Visage  But mark me well tho' by yon Heaven I love thee  As much I think as a fond Parent can  Yet shou'dst thou which the Pow'rs above forbid  E'er stain the Honour of thy Name with Infamy  I cast thee off as one whose Impious Hands  Had rent asunder Nature's nearest Ties  Which once divided never join again  To Day I have made a noble Youth thy Husband  Consider well his Worth reward his Love  Be willing to he happy and thou art so  Exit  Sciolto  Cal  How hard is the Condition of our Sex  Thro' ev'ry State of Life the Slaves of Man  In all the dear delighful Days of Youth  A riged Father dictates to our Wills  And deals out Pleasure with a scanty Hand  To his the Tyrant Husband's Reign succeeds  Proud with Opinion of superior Reason  He holds Domestick Bus'ness and Devotion  All we are capable to know and shuts us  Like Cloyster'd Ideots from the World's Acquaintance  And all the Joys of Freedom wherefore are we  Born with high Souls but to assert our selves  Shake off this vile Obedience they exact  And claim an equal Empire o'er the World  Enter  Horatio  Hor  She's here yet oh my Tongue is at a loss  Teach me some Pow'r that happy Art of Speech  To dress my Purpose up in gracious Words  Such as may softly steal upon her Soul  And never waken the Tempestuous Passions  By Heaven she weepsForgive me Fair  Calista  If I presume on Privilege of Friendship  To join my Grief to yours and mourn the Evils  That hurt your Peace and quench those Eyes in Tears  Cal  To steal unlook'd for on my private Sorrow  Speaks not the Man of Honour nor the Friend  But rather means the Spy  Hor  Unkindly said  For oh as sure as you accuse me falsly  I come to prove my self  Calista  's Friend  Cal  You are my Husband's Friend the Friend of  Altamont  Hor  Are you not one Are you not join'd by Heav'n  Each interwoven with the other's Fate  Are you not mix'd like Streams of meeting Rivers  Whose blended Waters are no more distinguish'd  But roul into the Sea one common Flood  Then who can give his Friendship but to one  Who can be  Altamont  's and not  Calista  's  Cal  Force and the Wills of our Imperious Rulers  May bind two Bodies in one wretched Chain  But Minds will still look back to their own Choice  So the poor Captive in a Foreign Realm  Stands on the Shoar and sends his Wishes back  To the dear Native Land from whence he came  Hor  When Souls that shou'd agree to Will the same  To have one common Object for their Wishes  Look different ways regardless of each other  Think what a Train of Wretchedness ensues  Love shall be banish'd from the Genial Bed  The Nights shall all be lonely and unquiet  And ev'ry Day shall be a Day of Cares  Cal  Then all the boasted Office of thy Friendship  Was but to tell  Calista  what a Wretch she is  Alas what needed that  Hor  Oh rather say  I came to tell her how she might be happy  To sooth the secret Anguish of her Soul  To comfort that Fair Mourner that forlorn one  And teach her Steps to know the Paths of Peace  Cal  Say thou to whom this Paradise is known  Where lyes the blissful Region Mark my way to it  For oh 'tis sure I long to be at Rest  Hor  Thento be Good is to be HappyAngels  Are happier than Mankind because they are better  Guilt is the source of Sorrow 'tis the Fiend  The avenging Fiend that follows us behind  With Whips and Stings the blest know none of this  But rest in everlasting Peace of Mind  And find the height of all their Heav'n is Goodness  Cal  And what bold Parasite's officious Tongue  Shall dare to tax  Calista  's Name with Guilt  Hor  None shou'd but 'tis a busie talking World  That with licentious Breath blows like the Wnd  As freely on the Palace as the Cottage  Cal  What mystick Riddle lurks beneath thy Words  Which thou wou'dst seem unwilling to express  As if it meant Dishonour to my Virtue  Away with this ambiguous shuffling Phrase  And let thy Oracle be understood  Hor  Lothario  Cal  Ha what wou'dst thou mean by him  Hor  Lothario  and  Calista  Thus they join  Two Names which Heav'n decreed shou'd never meet  Hence have the Talkers of this populous City  A shameful Tale to tell for publick Sport  Of an unhappy Beauty a false Fair one  Who plighted to a noble Youth her Faith  When she had giv'n her Honour to a Wretch  Cal  Death and Confusion Have I liv'd to this  Thus to be treated with unmanly Insolence  To be the Sport of a loose Ruffian's Tongue  Thus to be us'd thus like the vilest Creature  That ever was a Slave to Vice and Infamy  Hor  By Honour and fair Truth you wrong me much  For on my Soul nothing but strong Necessity  Cou'd urge my Tongue to this ungrateful Office  I came with strong Reluctance as if Death  Had stood across my Way to save your Honour  Yours and  Sciolto  's yours and  Altamont  's  Like one who ventures thro' a burning Pile  To save his tender Wife with all her Brood  Of little Fondlings from the dreadful Ruin  Cal  Is this Is this the famous Friend of  Altamont  For noble Worth and Deeds of Arms renown'd  Is this this Talebearing officious Fellow  That watches for Intelligence from Eyes  This wretched  Argus  of a jealous Husband  That fills his easie Ears with monstrous Tales  And makes him toss and rave and wreak at length  Bloody Revenge on his defenceless Wife  Who guiltless dies because her Fool ran mad  Hor  Alas this Rage is vain for if your Fame  Or Peace be worth your Care you must be calm  And listen to the Means are left to save 'em  'Tis now the lucky Minute of your Fate  By me your Genius speaks by me it warns you  Never to see that curst  Lothario  more  Unless you mean to be despis'd be shunn'd  By all your virtuous Maids and noble Matrons  Unless you have devoted this rare Beauty  To Infamy Diseases Prostitution  Cal  Dishonour blast thee base unmanner'd Slave  That dar'st forgat my Birth and sacred Sex  And shock me with the rude unhallow'd Sound  Hor  Here kneel and in the awful Face of Heav'n  Breath out a solemn Vow never to see  Nor think if possible on him that ruin'd thee  Or by my  Altamont  's dear Life I swear  This PaperNay you must not flyThis Paper  Holding her  This guilty Paper shall divulge your Shame  Cal  What mean'st thou by that Paper What Contrivance  Hast thou been forging to deceive my Father  To turn his Heart against his wretched Daughter  That  Altamont  and thou may share his Wealth  A Wrong like this will make me ev'n forget  The Weakness of my SexOh for a Sword  To urge my Vengeance on the Villain's Hand  That forg'd the Scrowl  Hor  Behold can this be forg'd  See where  Calista  's Name  Shewing the Letter near  Cal  To Atoms thus  Tearing it  Thus let me tear the vile detested Falshood  The wicked lying Evidence of Shame  Hor  Confusion  Cal  Henceforth thou officious Fool  Meddle no more nor dare ev'n on thy Life  To breath an Accent that may touch my Virtue  I am my self the Guardian of my Honour  And wo' not bear so insolent a Monitor  Enter  Altamont  Alt  Where is

out the Offender  And do thee ample Justice  Cal  Turn to him  Alt  Horatio  Cal  To that Insolent  Alt  My Friend  Cou'd he do this He who was half my self  One Faith has ever bound us and one Reason  Guided our Wills Have I not found him just  Honest as Truth it self And cou'd he break  The Sanctity of Friendship Cou'd he wound  The Heart of  Altamont  in his  Calista  Cal  I thought what Justice I should find from thee  Go fawn upon him listen to his Tale  Applaud his Malice that wou'd blast my Fame  And treat me like a common Prostitute  Thou art perhaps Confederate in his Mischief  And wilt believe the Legend if he tells it  Alt  Oh Impious What presumptuous Wretch shall dare  To offer at an Injury like that  Priesthood nor Age nor Cowardise it self  Shall save him from the Fury of my Vengeance  Cal  The Man who dar'd to do it was  Horatio  Thy darling Friend 'Twas  Altamont  's  Horatio  But mark me well While thy divided Heart  Doats on a Villain that has wrong'd me thus  No Force shall drag me to thy hated Bed  Nor can my cruel Father's Pow'r do more  Than shut me in a Cloyster there well pleas'd  Religious Hardships will I learn to bear  To fast and freeze at Midnight Hours of Pray'r  Nor think it hard within a lonely Cell  With melancholy speechless Saints to dwell  But bless the Day I to that Refuge ran  Free from the Marriage Chain and from that Tyrant Man  Exit  Calista  Alt  She's gone and as she went Ten thousand Fires  Shot from her angry Eyes as if she meant  Too well to keep the cruel Vow she made  Now as thou art a Man  Horatio  tell me  What means this wild Confusion in thy Looks  As if thou wert at variance with thy self  Madness and Reason combating within thee  And thou wert doubtful which shou'd get the better  Hor  I wou'd be dumb for ever but thy Fate  Has otherwise decreed it thou hast seen  That Idol of thy Soul that fair  Calista  Thou hast beheld her Tears  Alt  I have seen her weep  I have seen that lovely one that dear  Calista  Complaining in the Bitterness of Sorrow  That thou my Friend  Horatio  thou hadst wrong'd her  Hor  That I have wrong'd her Had her Eyes been fed  From that rich Stream which warms her Heart and number'd  For ev'ry falling Tear a drop of Blood  It had not been too much for she has ruin'd thee  Ev'n thee my  Altamont  She has undone thee  Alt  Dost thou join Ruin with  Calista  's Name  What is so fair so exquisitely good  Is she not more than Painting can express  Or youthful Poets fancy when they love  Does she not come like Wisdom or good Fortune  Repleat with Blessings giving Wealth and Honour  The Dowry which she brings is Peace and Pleasure  And everlasting Joys are in her Arms  Hor  It had been better thou hadst liv'd a Beggar  And fed on Scraps at great Mens surly Doors  Than to have match'd with one so false so fatal  Alt  It is too much for Friendship to allow thee  Because I tamely bore the Wrong thou didst her  Thou dost avow the barb'rous brutal Part  And urge the Injury ev'n to my Face  Hor  I see she has got Possession of thy Heart  She has charm'd thee like a Siren to her Bed  With Looks of Love and with enchanting Sounds  Too late the Rocks and Quicksands

Wickedness  Unweary'd with Forgiving scarce cou'd pardon  He who was all to me Child Brother Friend  With barb'rous bloody Malice sought my Life  Alt  Thou art my Sister and I would not make thee  The

Stars  But thy known Voice has lur'd her back again  Methinks I fain wou'd set all right with thee  Make up this most unlucky Breach and then  With thine and Heav'ns Forgiveness on my Soul  Shrink to my Grave and be at ease for ever  Hor  By Heav'n my Heart bleeds for thee ev'n this moment  I feel thy Pangs of disappointed Love  Is it not pity that this Youth shou'd fail  That all this wond'rous Goodness shou'd be lost  And the World never know it oh my  Altamont  Give me thy Sorrows let me bear 'em for thee  And shelter thee from Ruin  Lav  Oh my Brother  Think not but we will sha e in all thy Woes  We'll sit all Day and tell sad Tales of Love  And when we light upon some faithless Woman  Some Beauty like  Calista  false and fair  We'll fix our Grief and our Complaining there  We'll

Table with a Skull and other Bones a Book and a Lamp on it  Calista  is discover'd on a Couch in Black her Hair hanging loose and disordered After Musick and a Song she rises and comes forward  SONG  I  HEAR you Midnight Phantoms hear  You who pale and wan appear  And fill the Wretch who wakes with Fear  You who wander scream and groan  Round the Mansions once your own  You whom still your Crimes upbraid  You who rest not with the dead  From the Coverts where you stray  Where you lurk and shun the Day  From the Charnel and the Tomb  Hither haste ye hither come  II  Chide  Calista  for Delay  Tell her 'tis for her you stay  Bid her die and come away  See the Sexton with his Spade  See the Grave already made  Listen Fair one to thy Knell  This Musick is thy passing Bell  Cal  'Tis well these Solemn Sounds this Pomp of Horror  Are fit to feed the Frenzy in my Soul  Here's room for Meditation ev'n to Madness  'Till the Mind burst with Thinking this dull Flame  Sleeps in the Socket sure the Book was left  To tell me somethingfor Instruction then  He teaches holy Sorrow and Contrition  And PenitenceIs it become an Art then  A Trick that lazy dull luxurious Gownmen  Can teach us to do over I'll no more on't  Throwing away the Book  I have more real Anguish in my Heart  Than all their Pedant Discipline e'er knew  What Charnel has been rifled for these Bones  Fie this is Pageantrythey look uncoothly  But what of that If he or she that own'd 'em  Safe from Disquiet sit and smile to see  The Farce their miserable Relicks play  But here's a Sight is terrible indeed  Is this that Haughty Gallant Gay  Lothario  That dear perfidiousAhhow Pale he looks  How Grim with clotted Blood and those dead Eyes  Ascend ye Ghosts fantastick Forms of Night  In all your diff'rent dreadful Shapes ascend  And match the present Horror if you can  Enter  Sciolto  Sci  This Dead of Night this silent Hour of Darkness  Nature for Rest ordain'd and soft Repose  And yet Distraction and tumultuous Jars  Keep all our frighted Citizens awake  The Senate weak divided and irresolute  Want Pow'r to succour the afflicted State  Vainly in Words and long Debates they're Wise  While the fierce Factions scorn their peaceful Orders  And drown the Voice of Law in Noise and Anarchy  Amidst the general Wreck see where she stands  Pointing to  Calista  Like  Helen  in the Night when  Troy  was sack'd  Spectatress of the Mischief which she made  Cal  It is  Sciolto  be thy self my Soul  Be strong to bear his fatal Indignation  That he may see thou art not lost so far  But somewhat still of his great Spirit lives  In the forlorn  Calista  Sci  Thou wert once  My Daughter  Cal  Happy were it I had dy'd  And never lost that Name  Sci  That's something yet  Thou wer't the very Darling of my Age  I thought the Day too short to gaze upon thee  That all the Blessings I cou'd gather for thee  By Cares on Earth and by my Prayers to Heav'n  Were little for my Fondness to bestow  Why didst thou turn to Folly then and curse me  Cal  Because my Soul was rudely drawn from yours  A poor imperfect Copy of my Father  Where Goodness and the strength of manly Virtue  Was thinly planted and the idle Void  Fili'd up with light Belief and easie Fondness  It was because I lov'd and was a Woman  Sci  Hadst thou been honest thou hadst been a Cherubin  But of that Joy as of a Gem long lost  Beyond Redemption gone think we no more  Hast thou e'er dar'd to meditate on Death  Cal  I have as on the end of Shame and Sorrow  Sci  Ha answer me say hast thou cooly thought  'Tis not the Stoick's Lessons got by Rote  The Pomp of Words and Pedant Dissertations  That can sustain thee in that Hour of Terror  Books have taught Cowards to talk nobly of it  But when the Trial comes they start and stand agas    Hast thou consider'd what may happen after it  How thy Account may stand and what to answer  Cal  I have turn'd my Eyes inward upon my self  Where foul Offence and Shame have laid all waste  Therefore my Soul abhors the wretched Dwelling  And longs to find some better place of Rest  Sci  'Tis justly thought and worthy of that Spirit  That dwelt in ancient  Latian  Breasts when  Rome  Was Mistress of the World I wou'd go on  And tell thee all my Purpose but it sticks  Here at my Heart and cannot find a way  Cal  Then spare the Telling if it be a Pain  And write the Meaning with your Ponyard here  Sci  Oh truly guess'dseest thou this trembling Hand  Holding up a Dagger  Thrice Justice urg'dand thrice the slack'ning Sinews  Forgot their Office and confest the Father  At length the stubborn Virtue has prevail'd  It must it must be soOh take it then  Giving the Dagger  And know the rest untaught  Cal  I understand you  It is but thus and both are satisfy'd  She offers to kill her self  Sciolto  catches hold of her Arm  Sci  A Moment give me yet a Moment's space  The stern the rigid Judge has been obey'd  Now Nature and the Father claim their turns  I have held the Ballance with an Iron Hand  And put off ev'ry tender human Thought  To doom my Child to Death but spare my Eyes  The most unnatural Sight least their Strings crack  And my old Brain split and grow mad with Horror  Cal  Ha Is it possible and is there yet  Some little dear Remain of Love and Tenderness  For poor undone  Calista  in your Heart  Sci  Oh when I think what Pleasure I took in thee  What Joys thou gav'st me in thy prattling Infancy  Thy sprightly Wit and early blooming Beauty  How I have stood and fed my Eyes upon thee  Then lifted up my Hands and wond'ring blest thee  By my strong Grief my Heart ev'n melts within me  I cou'd curse Nature and that Tyrant Honour  For making me thy Father and thy Judge  Thou art my Daughter still  Cal  For that kind Word  Thus let me fall thus humbly to the Earth  Weep on your Feet and bless you for this Goodness  Oh 'tis too much for this offending Wretch  This Paricide that Murders with her Crimes  Shortens her Father's Age and cuts him off  E'er little more than half his Years be number'd  Sci  Wou'd it were otherwisebut thou must die  Cal  That I must die it is my only Comfort  Death is the Privilege of human Nature  And Life without it were not worth our taking  Thither the Poor the Pris'ner and the Mourner  Fly for Relief and lay their Burthens down  Come then and take me now to thy cold Arms  Thou meagre Shade here let me breathe my last  Charm'd with my Father's Pity and Forgiveness  More than if Angels tun'd their Golden Viols  And sung a  Requiem  to my parting Soul  Sci  I am summon'd hence e'er this my Friends expect me  There is I know not what of sad Presage  That tells me I shall never see thee more  If it be so this is our last Farewel  And these the parting Pangs which Nature feels  When Anguish rends the HeartstringsOh my Daughter  Exit  Sciolto  Cal  Now think thou curst  Calista  now behold  The Desolation Horror Blood and Ruin  Thy Crimes and fatal Folly spread around  That loudly cry for Vengeance on thy Head  Yet Heav'n who knows our weak imperfect Natures  How blind with Passions and how prone to Evil  Makes not too strict Enquiry for Offences  But is aton'd by Penitence and Pray'r  Cheap Recompence here 'twou'd not be receiv'd  Nothing but Blood can make the Expiation  And cleanse the Soul from inbred deep Pollution  And see another injur'd Wretch is come  To call for Justice from my tardy Hand  Enter  Altamont  Alt  Hail to you Horrors hail thou House of Death  And thou the lovely Mistress of these Shades  Whose Beauty gilds the more than midnight Darkness  And makes it grateful

Cal  I know thee well thou art the injur'd  Altamont  Thou com'st to urge me with the Wrongs I ha' done thee  But know I stand upon the Brink of Life  And in a Moment mean to set me free  From Shame and thy Upbraiding  Alt  Falsly falsly  Dost thou accuse me when did I complain  Or murmur at my Fate For thee I have  Forgot the Temper of  Italian  Husbands  And Fondness has prevail'd upon Revenge  I bore my load of Infamy with Patience  As Holy Men do Punishments from Heav'n  Nor thought it hard because it came from thee  Oh then forbid me not to mourn thy Loss  To wish some better Fate had rul'd our Loves  And that  Calista  had been mine and true  Cal  Oh  Altamont  'tis hard for Souls like mine  Haughty and fierce to yield they have done amiss  But oh behold my proud disdainful Heart  Bends to thy gentler Virtue yes I own  Such is thy Truth thy Tenderness and Love  Such are the Graces that adorn thy Youth  That were I not abandon'd to Destruction  With thee I might have liv'd for Ages blest  And dy'd in Peace within thy faithful Arms  Alt  Then Happiness is still within our reach  Here let Remembrance lose our past Misfortunes  Tear all Records that hold the fatal Story  Here let our Joys begin from hence go on  In long successive Order  Cal  What in Death  Alt  Then art thou fix'd to dieBut be it so  We'll go together my advent'rous Love  Shall follow thee to those uncertain Beings  Whether our lifeless Shades are doom'd to wander  In gloomy Groves with discontented Ghosts  Or whether thro' the upper Air we fleet  And tread the Fields of Light still I'll pursue

kind unpractis'd Heart that never yet  Has listen'd to the false ones of thy Sex  Nor known the Arts of ours she shall reward thee  Meet thee with Virtues equal to thy own  Charm thee with Sweetness Beauty and with Truth  Be blest in thee alone and thou in her  Enter  Horatio  Hor  Now mourn indeed ye miserable Pair  For now the Measure of your Woes is full  Alt  What dost thou mean  Horatio  Hor  Oh 'tis dreadful  The great the good  Sciolto  dies this Moment  Cal  My Father  Alt  That's a deadly Stroak indeed  Hor  Not long ago he privately went forth  Attended but by few and those unbidden  I heard which way he took and strait pursu'd him  But found him compass'd by  Lothario  's Faction  Almost alone amidst a Crowd of Foes  Too late we brought him Aid and drove them back  E'er that his

wrests his Sword from him  Hor  Ha what means  The frantick  Altamont  Some Foe to Man  Has breath'd on ev'ry Breast Contagious Fury  And Epidemick Madness  Enter  Sciolto  pale and bloody supported by Servants  Cal  Oh my Heart  Well may'st thou fail for see the Spring that fed  Thy Vital Stream is wasted and runs low  My Father will you now at last forgive me  If after all my Crimes and all your Suff'rings  I call you once again by that dear Name  Will you forget my Shame and those wide Wounds  Lift up your Hand and bless me e'er I go  Down to my dark Abode  Sci  Alas my Daughter  Thou hast rashly ventur'd in a stormy Sea  Where Life Fame Virtue all were wreck'd and lost  But sure thou hast born thy part in all the Anguish  And smarted with the Pain then rest in Peace  Let Silence

 Altamont  Come near and let me bless thee e'er I die  To thee and brave  Horatio  I bequeath  My FortunesLay me by thy Noble Father  And love my Memory as thou hast done his  For thou hast been my SonOh gracious Heav'n  Thou that hast endless Blessings still in store  For Virtue and for filial Piety  Let Grief Disgrace and Want be far away  But multiply thy Mercies on his Head  Let Honour

Bond that ties it fast  Exeunt omnes  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs BRACEGIRDLE who play'd  Lavinia  YOU see the tripping Dame could find no Favour  Dearly she paid for Breach of good Behaviour  Nor could her loving Husband's Fondness save her  Italian  Ladies lead but scurvy Lives  There's dreadful dealing with Eloping Wives  Thus 'tis because these Husbands are obey'd  By force of Laws which for themselves they made  With Tales of old Prescriptions they confiae  The Right of Marriagerule to their Male Line  And Hust and Domineer by Right Divine  Had we the Pow'r we'd make the Tyrants know  What 'tis to fail in Duties which they owe  We'd teach the saunt'ring Squire who loves to roam  Forgetful of his own dear Spouse and Home  Who Snores at Night supinely by her side  'Twas not for this the Nuptial Knot was ty'd  The plodding Pettyfogger and the Cit  Have learn'd at least this Modern way of Wit  Each illbred senseless Rogue tho' ne'er so dull  Has th' Impudence to think his Wife a Fool  He spends the Night where merry Wags resort  With joking Clubs and Eighteenpenny Port  While she poor Soul's contented to regale  By a sad Seacole Fire with Wigs and Ale  Well may the Cuckoldmaking Tribe find Grace  And fill an absent Husband's empty place  If you would e'er bring Constancy in Fashion  You Men must first begin the Reformation  Then shall the Golden Age of Love return  No Turtle for her wand'ring Mate shall mourn  No Foreign Charms shall cause Domestick Strife  But ev'ry marry'd Man shall toast his Wife  Phillis  shall not be to the Country sent  For Carnivals in Town to keep a tedious  Lent  Lampoons shall cease and envious Scandal die  And all shall live in Peace like my good Man and I  FINIS
