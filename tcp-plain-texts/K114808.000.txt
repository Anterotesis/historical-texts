 portrait of William Oldys  From an Original Picture in the Possession of Iohn Taylor  Esq  Engrav'd by Balston  William Oldys Esq  r    THE  BRITISH  LIBRARIAN Exhibiting a COMPENDIOUS REVIEW OR ABSTRACT Of our most Scarce Useful and Valuable BOOKS IN ALL SCIENCES AS WELL IN  MANUSCRIPT  AS IN PRINT With many CHARACTERS  Historical  and  Critical  OF THE AUTHORS their ANTAGONISTS  c  In a Manner never before attempted And Useful to all READERS With a Complete INDEX to the Volume  Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere  Hor  LONDON  Printed for T OSBORNE in  Gray'sInn  MDCCXXXVIII  THE INTRODUCTION  THE vast Number of Books which the Pen and Press have produced has made all Lovers of Literature desirous of knowing by some compendious Me∣thods what has been written in the several Sciences to which they have appropriated their Studies And this Desire grows more importunate as the Difficulty encreases of satisfying it the Works of the Learned multiplying so much beyond the Accounts which are given of them and our Attention being engrossed to the Regard only of  some  few Writers by those very means which might be used to give us a tolerable notice of  all  who any ways deserve it  For several Attempts have indeed been made in many Countries to gratify in some measure this universal Cu∣riosity but in  England  especially by such narrow and cir∣cumscribed Schemes as have left many Impediments to the Advancement of human Knowledge unremov'd For thro' the Defect of such Intelligence in its proper Extent how many AUTHORS have we who are consuming their Time their Quiet and their Wits in searching after that which is either past finding or already found In admiring at the Penetrations themselves have made tho' to the Rind only in those very Branches of Science which their Fore∣fathers have pierced to the Pith And how many who  would be  Authors as excellent as ever appear'd had they but such Plans or Models laid before them as might induce them to marshal their Thoughts into a regular Order or did they but know where to meet with Concurrence of Opinion with Arguments Authorities or Examples to corroborate and ripen their teeming Conceptions  Again had such Intelligence been dispersed in its due Scope and Latitude how many BOOKSELLERS who would neither  be impos'd  upon themselves with mere Transcripts  of obsolete and obscure Works for modern Compositions nor  impose upon others  so much to the Discredit of their Trade and in the main to their own Disadvantage either such injudicious Valuations of some old Books or so many im∣mature Publications of new ones when the same Subjects are already more significantly handled at their very Elbows but mourning in a kind of Sackloth and Ashes for that Re∣vival they might at a much easier Expence be preferr'd to knew the Possessors but where even in their own Shops to find them Nor yet would they  impose upon themselves  the Losses they often so voluntarily do of turning those very Pieces to Wastepaper which to some Reader or other would be most acceptable knew the one how to  communicate  and the other how to  compass  the  Contents  thereof  Lastly how many READERS who would not be glad of attaining to Knowledge the shortest way seeing the Orb thereof is swoln to such a Magnitude and Life but such a Span to grasp it How many who have not some Curiosity to know the Foundations of those Tenets upon which they so securely trust their Understandings Or where the Foot∣steps of those Precepts and Precedents may be found which have given Direction to so many modern Performances Who would not embrace the most likely means to detect the vile Grievance of Plagiarism and deter so many disad∣vantageous Repetitions of the same thing What Reader would not think it convenient to be apprized of the Worth of Authors before he gave them place in his Study or Esteem by some previous Characters or little Analysis of what is comprized in them And who would not find it commo∣dious to have the opportunity of revising the Library of which he is he has been or may be possess'd in faithful Portraits thereof at such Times and Places in which he cannot come at the Originals In a word if he be ignorant who would not covet to enlarge his Knowledge If he be knowing who would not willingly refresh his Memory And yet all the Expedients we have to accommodate the Cu∣rious with so many  Desiderata  are only some superficial  Catalogues  either of Authors rather than their Works or of the Works of Authors only in some one peculiar place of Education or in some single Science or else those which have been most cursorily taken of some particular Libraries and also a few  Extracts  limited to the Recom∣mendation only of some modern Writers  As for our CATALOGUES of Books they are generally and indeed necessarily thro' the great Charge and Hurry which attend the making and printing them at proper Junc∣tures so short and defective that we cannot often under∣stand by the two or three Words they bestow upon a Vo∣lume the very Title nor sometimes the Size nor frequently the Time when it was printed much less the Matter treated of therein So that many Gentlemen who live remote from the Places where our Sales and Auctions are made are by the blind and doubtful Informations which these Cata∣logues afford them both led to overlook some Books which they have most occasion for and to give Commissions for the Purchase of others by which they are utterly disappointed as answering in no wise their Expectation Nay many who have Opportunities even of being present where such Libra∣ries are disposed of do still after Examination commonly meet with no less Disappointment For the bare and naked  Titles  of Books especially so contracted are insufficient to explain them at best or when their Contents are ingenuously design'd to be signified by the Titles but on the contrary the Titles of many are often mere Paradoxes Enigmas and even Contrarieties to the Subjects or Arguments maintained in them and are so disguised many times thro' Artifice by the Authors Editors and Booksellers themselves to de∣ceive the Purchaser and catch him by the Purse This Deceit will last as long as Books if the other Expedient of  Extracts  is not more effectually put in execution than it has hitherto been done  For EXTRACTS indeed would have prevented all these In∣conveniencies had they been employ'd in a Scheme only as comprehensive as it is obvious to be suggested But tho' it is above fifty Years since such Extracts of Books were first publish'd in  England  yet do all or the greatest part which have been here made respect only the Works of a few con∣temporary Writers as if it were a shame not to be ungrateful and trample those Predecessors into Oblivion by the help of whose Learning and Abilities the Moderns have improved their own But this is a very partial and pernicious kind of Flattery so to celebrate and compliment the Learning and Genius of the present Times that Posterity may not believe any before them worthy of their notice For those who ex∣tend not their Knowledge beyond their own Age must not only lose the noblest Inheritance of their Ancestors but in∣struct their Successors to imitate their Example and deal  the same measure to the  present  which these have dealt to the  past  For these Reasons and many others in which an intelli∣gent Reader might forestall us we think it high time to be∣gin with an Undertaking which may include both those Ex∣pedients to their full Advantage in a  Catalogue  more com∣plete as to the  Titles  of Books which alone would be no inconsiderable Improvement upon what has been done and an  Extract  more unlimited as to the Times in which they were written than have hitherto appear'd among us so as to facilitate the most useful Researches of the Living by a general Register of or Directory to the most notable Particulars in the Labours of the Dead  And the more directly to prosecute this Attempt it is comprehended under the Title of the BRITISH LIBRARIAN For not only because Matters of our own Observation are generally most applicable to us or because the running into Books of all Countries would make it a Work of which we could never hope to see any End or tolerable Progress but chiefly because our Pains and Respect are principally due to our own Country because also such Service thereunto has been most neglected and because the Language thereof is most extensively useful to our own People we shall confine our∣selves to our own Authors and some indeed of those Fo∣reigners likewise who are either become as it were natura∣liz'd among us by Translations or have deserved to be so by treating of  English  Affairs  By calling this Work of our LIBRARIAN a  compendious Review  or  Abstract  we propose not always a minute and entire Epitome of every Book which would make a Scheme of this Compass so tedious and voluminous that we know not whether our Readers or ourselves would be first wearied in going thro' it Besides excellent Authors so serv'd would never satisfy curious Readers and those Authors who cannot claim that Character would either not deserve such distinction or not be suffer'd by the Attention which others equally deserving would also demand to exact such par∣ticular Cognizance in a Work of such a general Nature Our Business therefore cannot be so much to delight Read∣ers with the Flowers of Books or satisfy them with a smooth Contexture of all the Reasons and Arguments in them as to point out those Heads or Topicks which like so many Streams and Rivulets that severally arise in the Provinces of Literature may best direct them to the Fountains them∣selves  where every Reader will extract those Parts and those Proportions which no Epitomist can do for him So that by this Compendium of Hints and Advertisements concerning the most observable Persons and Places Times and Things which have been spoken of in the Writings of Men is intended a  Promptuary  only to the Search of those Writings as the most ready means to expedite the Attain∣ment of what every one is seeking For as the excellent Lord  Bacon  complains  "  De Augment Scientiarum Lib    cap    learned Men want such  Inven∣tories  of every thing in Art and Nature as rich Men have of their Estates"  Here then we hope to supply that Want by giving not only such Inventories of all those things but at the same time a Reference to the Observa∣tions in their Authors which have been further made on them and not only that but oftentimes what has been ob∣served even of the Authors also And this more expresly after presenting first of all their Titles commonly at length in a manner as agreeably diversified as the Authors will con∣veniently permit sometimes with Reasons for the Choice of them a transient View of the Drift or Design and Con∣tents of those we revive some Notice of their Vouchers and Authorities some Sketches of their chief Arguments or Examples some Indication of their Method and Instances of their Stile occasionally as they yield Matter most likely to be serviceable with Characters also sometimes subjoin'd which others have given of them And in this treatment of good old Authors we hope for the same effect as in the pruning of good old Trees in which the Gardener does not pride himself with the Twigs which he cuts off or throws together but expects that the Operation will be a means of making the Stocks themselves from whence they grew shoot forth with fresh Vigour and reward with better Fruits the Hands that shall gather them  By our most  Scarce Useful and Valuable  Books in all Sciences we intend the most considerable of all Times from the most Ancient we can procure to the most Modern in all Sizes even Pamphlets as well as bound Volumes And here our Scheme is so copious as to admit not only of many which have been long buried in Darkness by their great Age but some in a manner so young as never yet to have seen the Light of Publication being only in the Press or but going to it and that in a Method as may be hence gather'd more satisfactory than they are usually notified to the Pub∣lick  And because we have received hopes from some emi∣nent and judicious Persons who approve of this Undertak∣ing that we shall be favour'd from time to time with several useful  Manuscripts  which have long lain disregarded we propose to enrich our Collections with a short Account also of one or more in every Number  For as to the  Method of Publication  we find it most com∣modious that we may better admit the Communications of such as please to oblige us with their Correspondence that it should be  Monthly  and in such a  miscellaneous  manner as may yield the greatest Variety so that every Number may be a little  PocketLibrary  describing Folio's Quarto's Oc∣tavo's Pamphlets and Manuscripts By which different Sizes Readers of different Circumstances may be the easier suited in the Purchases they are inclin'd to Then also as much generally as Opportunity will allow of the various Sciences in every Number for the like Reason that Read∣ers of different Studies may the sooner be inform'd of what they are enquiring after For a Publication  Topically  di∣gested or  Chronologically  would be impracticable unless a Man had all the Books in the Kingdom together at once to methodize before he set out And then it would be very inconvenient by attracting only one Set of Readers to that one Branch and making all the rest wait till the Course of their respective Studies arose by which they would yet lose many pertinent Digressions upon their own Subjects which would occur in the different Sciences for they inter∣change and some Subjects are often to be found in Books of all Sciences while other Books would be denied admission under any one of them because they do not distinctly pro∣fess any or directly treat of all Moreover the Sale of some Sciences would in that case be so unproportionable to o∣thers that it would be a great Discouragement to the Under∣taking and render the Edition of the whole in many parts incomplete Besides this abstracted Revival of Books in∣dependent of each other as to the Subjects was never ob∣jected to any other Schemes of Abridgment which have been or are carried on in  Latin French  or  English  the Readers well knowing how easily they may be directed to what they want by  Tables  and  Indexes  annexed to every Volume  Thus we are not under any Anxiety about what Authors we shall commence with or with whom we shall conclude since that which is look'd for in this Number may arise in  the next Nor are we under any Apprehension of being misconstrued to pledge our own Judgment for the Merits of all the  Authors  we shall revive since whatever they are  es∣sentially  'tis the Application of them the Use to which they are converted that makes them  effectually  good or bad wherefore it is in the  Readers  Power to make few  Authors  unworthy of such Revival However we shall use our best Endeavours to please them and always be submissive to better Judgments So that if any Improvement of our Undertaking shall come to hand we shall gratefully acknow∣ledge and cheerfully pursue it if not and the Encourage∣ment of the Publick shall be proportionable to the Industry we bestow upon this Scheme we hope that any Imperfec∣tions in our execution thereof will bear no proportion to the Benefits which may universally flow from it  The CONTENTS of N  o    I GILDAS  his Epistle to the Britains  lamenting their Ruin

Collection  A copious INDEX to the whole Volume  THE  BRITISH  LIBRARIAN  N  o  I for JANUARY  I  A Description of the State of  Great Britain  written  Eleven Hundred  Years since by that Ancient and Famous Author  GILDAS  surnamed the  WISE  and for the Excellency of the Work translated into  English  c  with a Picture of the Author prefix'd  W Marshal  sculp Printed by  John Hancock    o  pages besides the Intro∣duction  c  THIS being the most ancient  British  Historian ex∣tant demands the first Place in our  British  Library Some Particulars relating to the Author with the different Editions and Character of his Work we refer to the bottom of the Page  We shall not here trouble our Reader with distinguishing two other Persons of the same Name with our Author since none of their genuine Works remain at least in History 'Tis enough to observe that this GILDAS called  Badonicus  because said to be born at  Bath  for his singular Prudence and the Se∣verity of his Morals was surnamed the WISE that he was Monk of  Bangor  flourish'd in the middle of the sixth Century and lived to about the end of the third part thereof as may ap∣pear by this Treatise  De Excidio Britanniae  the only one of his writing extant as Archbp  Usher  assures it to be He wrote it in  Latin  in a Stile according to that Age harsh and per∣plexed enough and the first Edition of it published by  Polydore Virgil  in vo  London  and dedicated to  Cuthbert Tonstal  Bp of  Durham  was from an incorrect Copy reprinted at  Basil  and at  London  This last Edition or another much about the same time which  John Josseline  gave of it from an∣other MS is but little more perfect than that first which was remitted into the  Bibliotheca Patrum  But the latest and best is in Dr  Gale  's Collection of ancient  English  Historians vol Fol  Oxon  who had the advantage of a more ancient and bet∣ter Copy as Bp  Nicholson  observes The Life of  Gildas  is writ∣ten at large by  Caradoc  of  Lancarvan  and by an Anonymous Author publish'd by  John a Bosco  in  Biblioth Florent  also more briefly in  Bale Pits  and  Fuller  's Worthies which last wonders not without Reason that  Gerard Vossius  should attribute a Comedy in  Plautus  to this our  Gildas  upon such slender Grounds as he there mentions As to his Character  Milton  tells us That  Gildas  is every way preferable in speaking of the  British  Wars to the  Saxon  Writers and a good Reason he gives for it because  Gildas  was nothing conceited of the  British  Valour whereas the  Saxons  ever magnified their own Deeds Vide  Mils Hist of Brit  Lib  But the Subject Matter of this  Epistle to the Britains  and his Method of handling it may be best gathered from the Arguments he briefly touches upon under distinct Heads in the following Order  Of the Island its Situation and Extent the number of its Cities the Magnificence of its Buildings and Fertility of its Soil The Disobedience of the People both in Religion and Government their monstrous Idols before the Introduction of Christianity and their Character by  Porphiry  for their detestable Tyrants Then he proposes to recount their Sufferings under the  Roman  Emperors not from the  British  Authors they being destroyed by their Foes or transported by their Exiles but from foreign Accounts So passes to The Subjection of the Island and how tamely she received the foreign Yoke Of her Rebellion under Queen  Boadicia  her neglect to secure her Conquests by Sea and Land and final Overthrow which intro∣duced Her second Subjection and dreadful Slavery till Her second Relief by  Christianity  which produced Her Persecution under  Dioclesian  and Many holy Martyrs as  Alban  of  Verolam  with  Aaron  and  Julius  of  Carlile  besides many others not here named also of their triumphant State till The  Arian  Heresy and The Usurpation and Tyranny of  Maximus  followed by The Invasion of the  Scots  and  Picts  Their Ex∣pulsion by the  Romans  The Reinvasion by those Neighbours And second Deliverance by the  Romans  who having taught the  Britains  to arm themselves and fortify their Country take their last Farewell Of the third  wastful Spoil by the aforesaid Enemy And by a de∣vouring Famine Of their pitiful but fruitless Address to the  Roman  Consul  Agitius  Of the brave Resistance to which some of them were driven by Necessity and the Victory they obtained against their Enemies by whom they were forsaken tho' not by their Iniquities Therefore Of their Vices and the Licentiousness which followed their Peace and Plenty Their Choice of wicked Princes and the Corruption of their Pastors The sudden A∣larm of their inveterate Enemies And new Calamities by Pestilence Of their Councils to redress themselves And Invitation of their far most cruel Enemy the  Sax∣ons  to aid them against the Northern Powers Who totally waste and spoil the Country The miserable State of the fugitive  Britains  their gathering head under  Aurelius Ambrosius  Battle with and Victory over the  Sax∣ons  Of the last Victory obtained by the  Britains  against them at the Siege of the Mountain of  Bath  or  BadonHill  forty four Years and one Month after the landing of the  Sax∣ons  and also  the Time of my Nativity  says  Gildas  In this Article the most observable of all the rest as being now enter'd into the times of his own Knowledge our Author first bewails and sharply reproves the Depravity of the  British  Rulers in general next gives particular Characters of five of them beginning with the Tyrant  Constantine  then living his Perfidiousness the Murders he committed under the Habit of the Saintly  Amphabale  his Adulteries and other Impieties Then proceeds to  Aurelius Conanus  whom he reproaches in like manner With equal Severity he scourges  Vortiper  a wicked Son of a good King Nor does he less chastise  Cuneglasse  that  golden Butcher  as his Name inports and concludes with the like Execrations a∣gainst that  Dragon  of the  Island Maglocune  who surpassed many Tyrants as in Power so in Mischief Here he sub∣joins the Menaces denounced against these and such like wicked Princes by the sacred Oracles of Holy Scripture After which follows a Transition from the  Civil  to the  Ec∣clesiastical  Corruptions and here he inveighs against the Vices of the Clergy no less freely than he had done against those in the State which with several Examples from the New Testament and some Fathers of the Church concludes this his  Epistle to the Britains  This  Translation  of the said  Epistle  appears to have been made near the first Entrance of the  Scottish  Line upon the  Throne of  England  Tho' this Translation of  Gildas  was made at the Beginning of K  James  's Reign we meet with no earlier Edition of it in Print than that publish'd vo and it was not improbably republished now again in on account of the sharp and Christian Reproofs therein of Kings and Priests The Editor says That in rendering this into  English  much Faith has been observed by which you may discover the Author still the same though in his Apparel fashioned to the Time in perusing of whom the Reader shall find that  Impiety is the great Destroyer of Empires and that Kingdom which remains most immaculate from Sin stands safest from Ruin  as the Editor tells us and while the Translator was under some Confinement as he informs us himself in his large  Introduction to the Inhabitants of the Island  which further contains chiefly some Apologies for  Gildas  as to his using so much Scripture Application and that not according to the vulgar Version as  Polydore Virgil  has observ'd with an Answer also to this Author's erro∣neous Observation upon the  Dioclesian  Persecution from  Gildas  himself Then he strives more favourably to inter∣pret the Invectives wherewith  Gildas  has been accused to have aspersed the  Britains  by Sir  John Price  as that our Author having already recorded their praiseworthy Deeds in his  Chronicle  cited by  Henry  of  Huntington  intended now to admonish them of their reproveable Actions only in this  Epistle  according to what  Gildas  says in his own  Prologue  to it  "That he does not now determine so much to re∣port the Dangers of the bloody Battles of most valiant Sol∣diers as the Perils of slothful Men"  In like manner the Translator excuses the Character of so much Barbarity given to the  Scotch Picts  and  Irish  by our Author as also his hard Censures of the  Saxons  and  English  so descends from the ancient  Union  of these Nations to that which was then on foot between the  English  including the  British  and the  Scotch  and because of K  James  's Descent from the Blood Royal of these three Nations concludes with a Motion to  unite  also the Titles of his Dominions under the general Name of GREAT BRITAIN  II  A Dialogue betwene a  Knyght  and a  Clerke  concernynge the Power  Spiritual  and  Temporal Imprinted at  London  in  FleteStrete  in the

being born in a Village of that Name in  Surrey  as  Camden  and others have observ'd It was written by our Author so early as the Year if the MS Note on the Copy before me is right There was another

John Duns Scotus  and afterwards his Antagonist In their grand Scholastic Controversy  Scotus  was distinguished Father of the  Reals  and  Occham  of the  Nominals Occham  flushed with his Success undertook Pope  John  the d and gave a mortal Wound to his  Temporal Power over Princes  He got a good Guardian  Lewis  of  Bavaria  the Emperor whose Court was his Sanctuary but he was excommunicated by the Pope and the Masters of  Paris  condemned him for an Heretic and burnt his Books which  Fuller  conceives to be the Cause why  Luther  was so vers'd in his Works which he had at his Fingers ends being the sole Schoolman in his Library whom he esteem'd The Pope being afterwards it seems reconciled to him he was restored to his State with the Repute of an  Acute Schoolman Fox  in his  Book of Martyrs  Ed fol says that in the Time of K  Edward  II  "  Gulielmus Occham  was a worthy Divine and of a right sincere Judgment as the Times wou'd then either give or suffer"  The same Historian further fol mentions this  Dialogue  as of  Occham  's Writing tho' it appeared without the Name of its Author He there also men∣tions another of his Books called his  Questions and Distinctions  and quotes  John Sleidan  's History in his Commendation who telling us the said  Occham  flourished in the Year gives us an Abstract of another of his Books on  the Authority of the Bishop of Rome  These two last with two more of his writing were printed abroad between the Years and as appears in  Corn à Beughem  's  Incunab Typographiae  mo Amst p As for the Author's Death some place it in others seventeen Years later See  Leland Bale Pits Fuller  Dr  Cave Du Pin  c    THis notable little Tract was written to silence the Clergy and answer their unreasonable Expectations that the Pope might exercise a Jurisdiction over the Temporalities of  Princes and the Church be exempted from contributing of its Riches in time of need either for the Relief of the Poor or the Security of the Nation where they abide as may ap∣pear by the following Abstract thereof  CLERICUS begins with complaining how much the Ec∣clesiastical Rights are invaded and what wrongs the Clergy endure against all Law MILES asks him what Law is And he answers the Ordinances of the Popes and Decrees of the Fathers MILES allows that what they have hereto∣fore ordain'd in Matters of Temporality may be Law to the Clergy but not to the Laity none having power to ordain Statutes of Things over which they have no Lord∣ship therefore that he lately laugh'd heartily when he heard that Pope  Boniface  VIII had made a new Statute that he himself should be above all secular Princes and King∣doms and that he needed but to put it into Writing and all things were his If he would have my Castle my Town my Field my Money or the like he need but to will to write and decree it and he's entitled to those Things Then CLERICUS would derive this Authority from  Christ  himself To whom it is said in the  Psalms Ask of me and I will give Nations to thine Heritage and all the World about to thy Possession  And of whom it is written  Tim    That he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords  Then he argues from the  Faith  of  Holy Church  that  Peter  was ordain'd  Christ  's full Vicar for himself and Successors so has the same Power over Temporalities as  Christ  had But here MILES distinguishes two States of  Christ  one of his Humility the other of his Power and Majesty The former from the Time that he took Flesh and Blood to his Passion the latter after his Re∣surrection when he said  All Power is given to me in Hea∣ven and Earth  That  Peter  was ordain'd  Christ  's Vicar for the State of his Humility and to follow him in those Things which he did in that State or to exercise that Power which  he as mortal Man did and not that which after his Glo∣rification he receiv'd Here it is proved from Scripture that  Christ  neither had nor pretended to a temporal Kingdom and that  Peter  had not by his Commission the Keys of the Kingdom of Earth given him but of Heaven that he was  Christ  's Vicar in the Godly Kingdom of Souls and not in  Temporal Lordship  of Castles and Lands And this again is proved out of St  Paul  Then CLERICUS flies to another Argument for seeing it allow'd that Holy Church may correct Sins he infers that he who has to do in the know∣ledge of Sin must know and deem in Right and Wrong and since there is Right and Wrong in Temporal Matters the Pope ought consequently to rule and deem in Temporal Causes But MILES having shew'd the Absurdity of this Sophism and that Right and Wrong in Temporal Matters are to be judg'd by Temporal Laws proves this also out of Scripture where even in case of the People's Disobedience to those Laws it appears the Clergy are only to admonish and warn them that they be  subject to Princes  and in an∣other Place that  every Soul  shall be  subject  to the  higher Powers  which excepts not the Clergy themselves  "And if you will needs be knowing in such Causes says he be∣cause Wrong and Sin are link'd together it belongs to you to know and deem in Causes of Wedlock I pray will you therefore say it follows that you shall know and deem of all that belongeth thereto for the  knitting of the Deed  "  So advises him not to intermeddle in the Judg∣ment of Things which concern Temporality  "For so much as ye usurp and take upon you that which belongs to others it is right mete that ye suffer as ye do"  Then CLERICUS asks if he can deny that the Temporal Power should be serviceable to the Spiritual MILES allows the Temporality should be so far serviceable to them as to find those who worship and serve God all that is necessary for them that in the old Law they were handsomely provided for but not thereby ordain'd any Temporal Kingdom or Lordship for what kind of Lordship was appointed the Mi∣nistry may appear from four or five Places of Scripture here quoted from whence it is demanded  "Lo to whom doth  Christ  and his Apostle  Paul  liken you To Work∣men to hired Men and Oxen and not to Kings I pray you be Workmen and hired Men Lords of Things Then it seemeth that  Temporalities  are granted you to help your Living and for Charge of Spiritual Admini∣stration  and not for  Lordship  And of the  Spiritual  it is written in the Law of  Moses  there ye be likened to an Ox that threshes for which it is enough to take his Meat though he fill all the Barn with his Travail"  A little far∣ther CLERICUS is for allowing Princes to enjoy their Tem∣poralities  "And let them suffer us says he in Peace with ours"  But MILES cannot allow this to be any ways rea∣sonable For says he we are to see the Wills of our Fore∣fathers fulfill'd who gave you these Temporalities so plen∣tifully that you should dispose both of them and yourselves to charitable Purposes to the Health of our Souls and the Honour of God to praying for the Dead and relieving the Wants of the Living  "But ye do nothing so ye spend away your Temporality in sinful Deeds and Vanity ye recke not for Honesty no nor for your own Law nor for Dedes of Mercy and Charity but in folly and  bo∣bance  and in liking of this World ye dispend all that was given you for an holy Intent Shall not his Wages be stopped who will not do Deeds of  Knighthood  He that holdeth of another and doth not his due Office and Ser∣vice he shall lose and forgo his  Fee  "  Here he brings in the Example of K  Joas  who would not let  Joidas  re∣ceive any more of the Ecclesiastical Revenue but apply it to the Reparation of God's House and concludes this Ar∣gument with observing  "That ye have received all such Lordships and Riches as the Wages of holy Chivalry and to the Intent to have Cloth and Food with which two the Apostle saith he held him paid and all the o∣verplus besides Cloth and Food ye ought to spend in Deeds of Mercy and Piety as on poor People that have need and on such as be sick and diseased and oppressed with Misery And if ye do not so then must  we have to do therewith  for then it falleth to us to take heed of your Temporality that ye beguile not and deceive the Quick and the Dead"  CLERICUS observes that King  Joas  did not apply the Money to his own Use but to that of Holy Church  "But nowadays ye take our Goods which ye spend not to the Use of Holy Church but on your busy and unruly Soldiers and on Ships and Engines of War"  MILES answers  "That neither does the King apply it to his own Use but for your Safeguard the De∣fence of Holy Church and of your Goods and Chattels That if the King's Power should fail the Gentry such as are needy and had prodigally consumed their Substance  would turn to yours and destroy all you have therefore that the King's Strength is to you as a strong Wall and his Peace is your Peace That by giving a little Portion to him you buy your own Safeguard But as ye have al∣ways been unkind for the Goodness he hath done so now ye complain against what is your own Profit That if Kings at their own Costs and Peril are to defend you and you to rest in Idleness and Luxury eating drinking and solacing yourselves then you only are Kings and they your Slaves"  Then he proves from Scripture again that the Church or Riches of it should not be spared when Christian People are in Danger  "The Ghostly Temple which is Mankind being of more worth than the Tem∣ple that is made of Lime and Stone"  CLERICUS ob∣jects that if those things which are once given to God may be taken away again then all Vows may be made void But MILES distinguishes that what he has said is not to with∣draw such Gifts but to apply them to those Uses for which they were first given Then CLERICUS would allude from the Words of our Saviour how free the Clergy were from paying Tribute to Princes But MILES argues that the Example he produces and the answer therein given was for Christ and not for you however grants that Clerks in their own Persons should be free but not such as lead their Lives as lewd Men Yet tho' some may be thus freed in their Person by the Privilege of Princes shall your Fields have now the same Freedom And he who had before a yearly Tribute from them lose it afterwards in you The Commonwealth must be defended at the Cost of the Com∣monalty and whatever Part thereof enjoys this Defence 'tis most agreeing with right that he set his Shoulder and help to bear the Burden Then if Possessions are as rightly subject to the common Charge as to the yearly Rent he shall be under Charge whoever owns them If ye talk of Prescription we answer in as much longer as this Free∣dom or Exemption has been allow'd by the Benignity of Princes so much the sooner ye should be ready to pay your Part where need requires it but both holy Writ and civil Powers abolish this Prescription as appears by Examples here cited CLERICUS thinks it hard that Kings should resume the Privileges granted by their Predecessors But MILES urges that any particular Privilege however long or firmly granted must submit to general Occasions and if it be found hurtful to the Commonwealth may be repeal'd  in time of need as  Solomon  in some Matters of Theft changed somewhat even of God's Law CLERICUS would insinuate that it was Emperors who establish'd these Things and that they might guide the Reins of the Law but not Kings MILES looks upon this as a kind of Blasphemy proceeding either from Ignorance or Envy so draws an Instance from  France  and the Empire shewing how di∣stinctly and independently the one exercises its Power from the other That as the Emperor may make Laws over all his Empire and add or diminish as he thinks good so may the King of  France  either utterly repel the Emperor's Laws or change or clearly banish them and at his Pleasure or∣dain new ones This he concludes with several Examples from Scripture proving the Subjection of the Clergy to their Princes as how by anointing they acknowledg'd them to be their Princes and Rulers how they guarded attended on and pray'd for them as such insomuch that CLERICUS cannot forbear breaking off the Conference with observing that it was drawing towards Night but he'd answer it all in the Morning  AFTER this manner ends this ancient and remarkable Treatise thus publish'd in  English  with express Priviledge by K  Henry  's Printer no doubt to forward and strengthen the  Reformation  then in its Infancy But if the Reader would see this Argument on the King's  Ecclesiastical Supremacy  as it more particularly regards the  English  Nation deduced from a vast Variety of our most authentic Instruments and Records we must refer him to Mr  Prynne  's voluminous Collections on that Head in three Volumes Folio of which we shall here next take a short Survey because of the Af∣finity of the Subject and its being traced from the earliest times however the Author is thereby ranged in this Num∣ber before some others who were earlier Writers  III  The first  Tome  of an exact  Chronological

Mischiefs to the several Companies of the City most of all endamaged the Company of Printers and Stationers most of whose Habi∣tations Storehouses Shops Stocks and Books were not only consumed but their Ashes and scorch'd Leaves con∣veyed aloft and dispersed by the Wind to Places above Miles distant to the Admiration of Beholders and that a∣mong Millions of other Books thus suddenly destroy'd

likewise the second Tome formerly pub∣lished and of the first Book and third Tome wherein he had made some Progress were there burnt together with it not above of them being rescued from the Fire to the Author's Damage near  l  wherefore he did not print his intended  Tables  for so few Copies of this Tome till God should enable him to reprint it especially since the Pages of the reprinted Volume

other Cir∣cumstances directed him together with the Pages and Lines where they most properly may be inserted in the next E∣dition With this Supplement the whole Work finishes at Page Then comes an Advertisement to the Readers informing us of fourteen several Tables he had made to this third Tome in an Alphabetical and Chronological Method after the Manner of the preceeding Volume And we are referr'd to such Tables in this last Volume also at the End of its Table of Contents But such Tables or Indexes were omitted at least in a very fair Set of these scarce and elabo∣rate Books whence this short View of them is extracted  This last Volume of Mr  Prynne  's said  Records  was design'd by him to have borne the same Title with the two former as may appear in the Book itself but the Author dying just before it was publish'd those who were concern'd in the Edition call'd it  The History of King John  c in hopes that appearing under that more general Title in the Shape and Disguise of an entire Work it would go off the more readily as Bishop  Nicholson  has suggested but with what Propriety or Regard to the Subject is left for others to consider 'Tis certain that neither of the three Volumes have been so sufficiently used by or even known to suc∣ceeding Writers of or upon our  English  History as such copious Materials so carefully collected do deserve One Reason no doubt is the Scarcity of the two former Volumes which are advanced to such an extraordinary Price that it is well known the  Complete Set  has been sold for  Thirty Pounds  Another reason for their having lain so much in Obscurity might be some pub∣lick Punishment the Author once underwent for writing an∣other  Book but in the former Reign and long before he was  Keeper  of the  Records  for which he yet had a handsome Re∣compence assign'd him by the Parliament however it might leave some Distaste to his Name upon the Minds of many as we may elsewhere observe The last cause of their Neglect may be that artful Disregard which has been insinuated of these  Col∣lections  to abate the Curiosity of the Laity and dissuade their looking into them The Right Reverend Author last quoted speaking of those two Tomes which perish'd in the Fire of  Lon∣don  adds  "And no Man has hitherto thought it worth his Ex∣pence and While to give us a new Edition from any of the few that escaped His Third has enough

Cyte  and of the Chartour and Lybartyes of  England  with  other dyvers Maters  good and necessary for every  Cytezen  to under∣stond and know  This is the only Title which appears in two fair Copies of this very scarce old Book which I have seen and the said Title is at the Head of the Kalendar or Table of Contents which is printed in double Columns as most of the Book also is But it seems to want the first Leaf which might contain a more gene∣ral Title and possibly the Name also of its Author For the first Signature in both those Copies is A the Book not being numerically paged at top nor has it any Printer's Name or Date when printed The late Mr  Hearne  in his Copy has en∣titled it  The Customes of London or  ARNOLDE  's Chronicle  And in some  Catalogue  I have seen it is call'd after the Title of the second Chapter  The Articles of the Charter and Liberties of the City of  London  by one  Arnold  a Citizen of  London  who liv'd  Whence probably that Copy might want the whole first Chapter at the End whereof which gives it the Name of a  Chronicle  it appears plainly to be continued down to the th or rather one Year being misprinted twice over the th of  Henry  the th which was in which Year this small Folio was probably printed There is the Name of  R A  and  Richard Arnolde  mention'd in many Forms of his Instruments as a Citizen  Haberdasher  and Merchant of  London  who might be the Author of this Collection which has among some few Matters of Digres∣sion several notable old Instruments and Memorials in it And tho' it may have been seen by some few Antiquaries who have written of this Metropolis yet is a Work for the generality so little known that Bishop  Nicholson  and others who have attempted to give Accounts of our Historical Writers are utterly silent hereof  c  Fol  THis Book cannot be better describ'd than by a recital of the several Chapters in the Table or Kalendar prefix'd only  we shall abridge some which are clogg'd with a

William Cuningham  Doctor in Physicke Excussum Londini in Officina Joan Daii Typographi Anno  Folio pages besides Dedication Preface and Index with many curious wooden Cuts  THis scarce and learned old Treatise so remarkable both in Beauty of the Print and Ornaments and Rarity of the Subject for a Book of such Antiquity has a Frontis∣piece from a neat wooden Cut wherein those Sciences leading to the Studies here treated of are represented with some of the Ancients who were eminent therein And at the Bottom of the said Title are these six Lines  In this  Glasse  if you will beholde  The sterry Skie and Yearth so wide  The Seas also with Windes so colde  Yea and thyselfe all these to guide  What this Type meane first learne a right  So shall the gayne thy Travaill quight  In his Dedication to  Robert Duddeley  of the mooste no∣ble Order of the Garter Knight Maister of the Horse to the Quene's mooste excellente Majestye  c  he tells his Lordship that Men may behold in this  Glass  the Heavens with her Planets and Stars the Earth with her beautiful Re∣gions and the Seas with her merveilous Increase and that  if his Lordship will take this Work into his Tuition he shall be boulden'd to present him with others of his Labours the particular Titles of seven whereof he here recites  Tho' this Dr  Cuningham  of  Norwich  had been a Traveller yet being bred a Physician it may be look'd upon as somewhat extraordinary that he should set forth a Book upon this Subject so much more copious and elegant than had hitherto been pub∣lish'd and also write so many others as he here mentions the Names whereof are  An Apology A New Quadrat by no Man ever publish'd The Astronomical Ring Organographia Gazo∣philacion Astronomicum Chronographia  and  Commentaries in Hip∣pocrates de Aëre Aquis Regionibus  The Author being now no more than twentyeight Years of Age    After this Dedication follow some  Latin  Verses by Dr  Gilbert Barckley  and  Tho Langley  of  Cambridge  in Praise of the Author and his Work At the Back of which is a wooden Print of the Author in his Doctor's Habit  Then follows his Preface setting forth the Benefits of these Cosmographical Studies Herein he tells us they are daily more and more perceiv'd for what Country or Island is not in our Age search'd out So exemplifies in  Vespu∣tius Americus  And concludes the said Preface with ob∣serving that by this Glass  "such as are delighted in tra∣vailing as well by Land as Water shall receive no small Comfort and the other sort by it may also protract and set out particular  Cards  for any Countrye Region or Pro∣vince or else the universal Face of the Earth in a  gene∣rale Map  And that the Precepts might seme facile and plaine I have says he reduced it into the Forme of a  Dialoge  the Names of the Personages indede fained but yet most aptly serving our Institution In which SPON∣DAEUS representing the Scholar maketh Doubtes asketh Questions objecteth yea and sometyme digresseth not from the Imaginations of the grosse witted Unto which PHILONICUS supplying the Office of a Teacher an∣swereth to all Objections and giveth Praecepts What Diligence I have given in time of the Printing to the Correction hereof and also in devising sundry newe  Ta∣bles Pictures Demonstrations  and  Praecepts  that you may easily judge by readyng of the same Worke Also what Charges the Printer hath susteined that his good Will might not be wanting that shall be evident confer∣rying his beautiful  Pictures  and  Letters  with such Workes as herto hath bene publish'd And thus I leave the with  my COSMOGRAPHICALL GLASS requirying that these my Travayles and Labours be not rewarded with Ingra∣titude or ill Reporte And if for the Difficultie of the Worke any Errour escape remember  I am the firste that ever in our Tongue have written of this Argument  and therefore am constrained to find out the Pathe  c  "  At  Norwich  the th of  July    The whole Work is divided into five Books in the first whereof after some general Heads leading to that Know∣ledge in Arithmetic and Geometry which is requisite for this Art he defines Cosmography and Geometry Then gives you three Figures or Pictures the first representing  Cosmography  by a Globe of the Heavens containing the Earth the second  Geography  representing the Earth and Waters only and the last  Chorography  or the Representa∣tion of some one Town or City which he illustrates by an  accurate Map  of the excellent City of NORWYCHE as the Forme of it is says he at this present with many Alphabetical References to an Explanation at the bottom of the principal Places set forth in the same which Map has been look'd upon as a very great Curiosity Hence he proceeds to define what the  World  is and to shew that it is made of  two Parts  The Number also of the  Heavens  with the Errors of some Ancients That only eight Hea∣vens were found out by the  Egyptians  that  Ptolemy  found out the ninth and  Alphonsus  the tenth So gives us a Fi∣gure of the  Coelestial Sphere  Next he describes what a  Cen∣tre  is what the  Axis  and what a  Diameter  what the  Poles  are what an  oblique Sphere  how a Sphere differs from a  Circle  The  Number  of Circles in a Sphere what the  Ho∣rizon  is the Division of it with Figures of the several sorts what the  Meridian  is the  Zenith Antipodes  the  Equinoctial  with the Use of the  Horizon Meridian  and  Equinoctial Circles  What the  Zodiac  is and the  Ecliptic  what a  Sign  is what a  Degree  and what a  Minute  with the  Septentrio∣nal  Signes  Meridional  Signes and the Use of the  Zodiac  A  Table  of many notable fixed  Stars  with their several Names their true Longitude Latitude and Declination faithfully rectified unto the Year profitable for finding out the Latitude of any Country or Place Then we have the two Declinations of every  Planet  distinguish'd with the Diversity of the Sun's Declination from  Ptolemy  's Time to ours and the Manner how to find out by a Quadrant the Sun's Declination After which we have a  Table  in two  Parts of  Declination  of the  Ecliptic  in  Degrees Minutes  and  Seconds  from the Equinoctial answering to the  Sun  's greatest Declination Degrees Minutes being the true Declination of the Sun in this our Author's Age which Table is more copiously useful than  Orontius  or Doctor  Re∣cord  's Table and yet not so prolix as  Erasmus Reignholt  's Next we have the  Poles  of the  Zodiac  explain'd what the  Summer Tropic  and what the  Winter  is Whence the four  Seasons  of the Year are derived what the two  Colures  are the  Artick  Circle and the  Antartick  defin'd from  Proclus  as most of the other Distinctions are Thus PHILONICUS having learn'd his Scholar what the  six  greater Circles of the Sphere are and what the  four  lesser gives him the reason why they are so distinguish'd from  John de SacroBosco  Then representing these several Parts together in one Figure or Picture he concludes his Account of the  Celestial  Sphere and so proceeds to that which comprehends the  Elementary  Region observing why it can consist but of four Elements their Order and Situation the Division of the Air where Comets Hail and Snow are engendred what the Earth is Diversity of Opinions touching its Form Objections against its Rotundity answer'd from  Cleomedes  also from the Ex∣ample of two Eclipses of the Moon and Observation of some Stars with Reference for further Proof to  Ptolemy Philo Aristotle Reignholt Orontius John de SacroBosco  and Master  Recorde  who does almost repeat all their Argu∣ments in his  Castle of Knowledge  Here joining together all the Parts which have been severally before treated of in one Type or Figure of a compleat Sphere representing both the Heavens and the Earth he concludes with making his Scholar give him a Recapitulation of what he had learnt in this first Book so proceeds to  The second Book  c  in which is plainly expressed the Order and Number of Zones Parallels and Climates also sundry ways for the exact finding out of the Meridian Line the Longitude and Latitude of Places with many other Pre∣cepts belonging to the making of a Carte or Mappe After an ingenious Introduction of this Book and Repetition of what is taught in it the Author seeing the Matter thereof chiefly de∣pends upon Dimension and Mensuration first shews what  Di∣mension  is what a Point what a Line what a Platform and what a Body is Then gives us a Table of  Measure  the quantity of  Helvetian  and of  English Miles  the different Signification of  Longitude  both in Astronomy and Cosmo∣graphy  what  Latitude  is how to find out the  Circuit  of the Earth and the Vertical Point with the Diversity of O∣pinions about the Circuit of the Earth Then of what Parts are habitable and what not Of the Zones and the Error of  Polybius  the Objection of some being uninhabitable an∣swered of the Inhabitants who are distinguished by the Diversity of their Shadows as the  Amphiscii  or doubleshadowed the  Ascii  or People without Shadows the  He∣teroscii  or those who have their Shadows on one Side as we who have our Shadow directly North and the  Antipodes  who have theirs to the South lastly the  Periscii  who have their Shadow going about the Horizon Here follows a  Table of Shadows  shewing their Proportion to the  Gnomon  it being divided into parts for every Degree of the Sun's Altitude and also the quantity of the Shadow in every Country Region and City thro' the universal Earth when the Sun is in the Equinoxial and Solsticial Points Then returning to the  Zones  he shews how they differ from  Cli∣mates  with  Ptolemy  's Division of Climates next what  Parallels  are exemplified in a Figure The number of Cli∣mates also in a Figure and Quantity both of them and Pa∣rallels with a  Table containing the number of Parallels and Climates  with the Elevation of the  PoleArtic  and  Quantity  of the longest Day and Night answering hereto Of South Parallels and the Reason why  Avicenne  thought the Air most temperate under the Equinoxial which introduces a Conjecture where  Paradise  was seated and  Lyra  's Interpre∣tation that the  Fiery Sword  was the  burning Zone  with a Con∣jecture where  Hell  is seated After which we have  Gla∣rian  's Manner of finding out the NoonStead or Meridian Line and four other Methods also of finding the same The Order of finding the Height of any Planet or fix'd Star in the Noonstead Line by Night Then follows  a Table of the Sun's Meridian Altitude above the Horizon  calculated for every Degree in the Zodiac respecting the Elevation of the PoleArtic at  Norwich  Degrees Min and the Sun's Declination Deg Min The manner to find out the Elevation of the Pole above the Horizon and the  Lati∣tude  of any Region City or Town several ways especially by the  AstronomyRing  Of finding the  Longitude  of any Place according to the Ancients by  Eclipses  of the Moon That  Atreus  found out the time of  Eclipses  The Cause of the Moon's Eclipse A Calculation of such Eclipses of the Moon as shall happen from the Year till apply∣ing  the Time of their Beginning in Years Days Hours and Minutes unto the Meridian of  Norwich  exactly which is Degrees and Minutes from the  Canary  Islands with the Figures of all the said Eclipses How to find the Longi∣tude of Regions by an Eclipse How to turn the Hours of the Day into Degrees and Minutes of the Equinoxial with a Table for that purpose  Apian  's Way of finding out the  Longitude  of Places by the  Jacob  's Staff  c  The Method to be taken when the Moon is West or East of the Star further illustrated by an Example of finding the Longitude of  Norwich  Another Method of finding the Longitude of any Region in every Place as well by Day as Night and at every Hour by means of a little  Clock  such as they used to wear in the fashion of a Tablet whereof were then made as excellent without  TempleBar  as any which were brought from  Flanders  with the Particulars of this Experiment ends this second Book  In the  third Book  is express'd the making and Portraiture of the Face of the Earth both in  Cartes  particular and also u∣niversal with divers Things incident thereto Here having shewn what a chief Requisite the Art of Drawing or Delineat∣ing is in the Study of Cosmography and what noble Rewards the Ancients had in store for the Inventors of Science when they not only gave them abundance of Treasure but also deified them for the same The Author descends to explain what an  Island  is what a  Peninsula  an  Isthmus  a  Conti∣nent  then exhibits them all in a Map together with an Answer to an Objection against the Form of the Terrestrial Globe so begins with teaching the Manner of making a particular Carte for any Region and here draws up a Ta∣ble of the  Quantity  and  Proportion  of the  Equinoxial  or any great Circle to every Parallel North and South therefrom Hence we are led to a particular Example containing the whole Process in making a  Map of England  and shewing how the Work chiefly depends on the Meridian Line ap∣pointing thereby the Longitudes and by Parallels of Cli∣mates whose use in a Carte is to limit the Latitude from the Equinoxial This is illustrated by a Draught or Figure From hence we are taught how to describe three or four Regions in one Map or as many as are contained in one eighth Part of the Earth and after the particular Instruc∣tions for this Operation we have the Form also thereof de∣lineated to the Eye So we proceed to the Composition of a Map for one half of the Earth whereof also we have a  Draught And this is followed by the Method of making a Map for the whole Earth which we are again further ac∣quainted with by lineal Representations And here we have a  Table  of the  Segments  and Parts of the Equinoxial drawn in a plain Platform answering to the Circumference of Parallels A little further is another  Table of Regions  and  Cities  subject to the  Signs  and  Planets  Then we have the Figure of an  Instrument  serving to make a Map without knowing Longitude or Latitude which is here called a  Geo∣graphical Plain Sphere  by which not only the Distance of one Place from another may be found in the Map but of the Places themselves in Miles also from one another as by a Demonstration here figured out appears And with this Experiment ends the third Book  The  Fourth Book  lays down such necessary Principles and Rules as are to be observed in  Hydrography  and  Navigation  Herein it is proposed not to shew the minute Difference of one Vessel from another nor their Names nor their Burden but how to correct the Errors in guiding and directing them And first we have a Division of the Waters from the gene∣ral Name of the Ocean down to Lakes and Ponds The Cause of Spring and Ebb  Tides  Cause of  Ebbing  and  Flow∣ing  How to find the  Age  of the  Moon  at all times The  Epact  with a  Table  to find it A  Table  of the  Sun's rising  and  going down  throughout the Year whereby to find how long the Moon shines every Night A  Table  shewing how long the  Moon shines  in our  Horizon Another  shewing in what Places chiefly on the  English  Shore the Moon makes full Seas How to know the exact  Time  of  Ebbing  and  Flow∣ing  with a  Table  for finding out  Ebbs  and  Floods  in the Coasts of  England Scotland Ireland Dutchland  and  France  A Description of the  Wind  The Number Division and Nature of the Winds The new Division of the Horizon into Parts by the learned Hydrographers seemingly in our Author's Time who here disposes them into a  Type  or  Figure  Of the Mariners  Compass  unknown to the Ancients found out by  Gemma  and a Draught of it The Praise of the  Needle  the Observations of  Jofrancus  in what Places it has erred How to correct the Needle in Daytime by help of the Sun in the Night by some fixed Star Of the Errors in describing the Shipman's Chart and the way how to sail by Longitudes and Latitudes How to direct a Ship to any Port How to know the Form of the LodeStar and to know in what Place they are who are driven  from their Course With these Discoveries and Directions in Cosmography Geography and Navigation our Author ends this fourth Book  The  Fifth Book  describes the Parts of the Earth particu∣larly according to late Observations with the  Longitudes  and  Latitudes  of Regions Provinces Islands Cities Towns Villages and Hills Also the Commodities Natures Laws Rights and Customs of many Countries and their Inhabi∣tants This begins with a particular Description of  Europe  containing  Christendom  and part of  Turky  beginning with  Ireland  as  Ptolemy  does In which after a short Account of the Products and Character of the People and Dimen∣sions of the Island he notes the chief Places with their Longitude and Latitude So proceeds to  England  which is treated of in the same manner Then  Scotland Iceland Corsica Sicily Sardinia Majorca  and  Minorca Gades Eu∣boea Crete  the  Cyclades  and  Sporades  In such like par∣ticular manner also of  Spain France  and  Germany  both  higher  Where our Author mentioning  Heydelberg  says he was gen∣teelly entertain'd at that University by  D Joan Langius T E∣rastus  Physicians and  D Balduinus  Reader of the Civil Law besides divers others at the time of his Commencement  and  lower  besides  Italy Rome  c So ends this Chapter of  Europe  with a particular Description of  Greece  Then follows the like Description of  Africa  and the prin∣cipal Places therein  Asia  after the same manner is next described and lastly such parts of  America  as are by Tra∣vail found out which concludes the whole Work After the Index follows an Extract of the Queen's Licence to  John Day  and his Assigns for the Term of his Life for the sole Printing this Book as also for the space of seven Years all such Books as he has printed or shall print But we have not yet met with any more of this Author's Writing printed by him how many soever he had ready for the Press which perhaps may be accounted for from the Emblem in the last Page of this Book which shews us the Figure of Death on a Monument and  Virtue  in the Shape of a Tree flourishing out of it  IX  A short Discovery of the unobserved Dangers of several sorts of ignorant and unconsiderate Practisers of  Physicke  in  Eng∣land  profitable not only for the deceived Multitude and easie for their mean Capacities but raising reformed and more advised Thoughts in the best Understandings with Directions for the safest Election of a  Physician  in Necessitie By  John Cotta  of  Northampton  Dr in Physicke  to pages  THIS Tract was the Product chiefly of that ten Years Observation and Experience which our Author had in  Northamptonshire  as he informs us in his Dedication to the Gentry thereof among whom he was first introduced by his honoured Friend Sir  William Tate  as therein also ap∣pears Not but the said Frauds and Corruptions in Physick were epidemical enough to have mov'd him to the like Ani∣madversions had he resided in any other part of the Nation For as he says in his  Epistle  to the  Reader    "So infinitely do the numbers of barbarous and unlearned  Counsellors of Health  at this time overspread all Corners of this Kingdom that their confused Swarms do not only every where cover and eclipse the Sunshine of all true Learning and Under∣standing but generally darken and extinguish the very Light of common Sense and Reason"  Therefore both in duty to the common Good and to the Sollicitations of his Friends he presents us with  "this needful Detection of harmful Succours and necessary Council for safe Supply"  He proposes to suit the meanest Readers with the Plainness and Simplicity of a familiar Stile and to keep the Current of the Text clear from all Quotation of ancient  Languages  referring only the learned to the Margin which latter he has observed through every Page His Method further is to illustrate his general Cautions and Rules with particular Cases and Reports drawn chiefly from those Parts where he now practised and resided as an Inducement to read and an Enticement to continue Example being neither least pleasing nor least profitable to the Vulgar  The Work itself is open'd with an  Introduction  shewing how desirable but how difficult it is to meet with an able Physician thro' the variety of Causes and Circumstances to be consider'd in Diseases and the Application of Remedies with the ill Consequences of the common Neglect and Igno∣rance herein and the monopolizing of Cures to the Pre∣rogative of this or that Secret to the Contempt of the due Permutation of Medicines and the Increase of Diseases both beyond their own Nature and the Constitutions of the Sick Here among those Things the indiscriminate use of which he discommends are mention'd Tobacco and Quicksilver and even Cassia and Rhubarb which being indiscreetly out of time and place dispenced bring Mischief instead of Good with other Instances here produced both of internal and external Remedies most sovereign and renowned in themselves which yet do bring forth effects unworthy of themselves and all because such a promiscuous and unskilful Rabble of the meanest Mechanicks Women Priests Witches Conjurers Jugglers and FortuneTellers are suffer'd to become MedicineMongers and make a gainful Traffic of Homicide it self That not only the Simple but those also of better Sort are deluded to encourage such Preten∣ders on account of some casual Success but says our Author  "As in Military Designs ofttimes a bold and foolhardy Enterprize above and beside Reason and beyond Ex∣pectation produceth an excellent and admir'd Good in the happy Issue yet it is not commended or in any case permitted as being very dangerous in ordinary Practice or Custom of Warfare so likewise divers Events of Me∣dicines prove good whose bold Use and rash Prescription is dangerous and unskilful"  He concludes this Chapter with observing That as improper Remedies are for the most part worse than Diseases and unlearned Physicians of all bad Causes of Diseases are themselves the worst it is not there∣fore a needless Learning more studiously to know the Good from Ill and Ill from Good beginning with the last first in  Chap  Of the Emperick  Herein is described what an Emperick is in what his Defects consist The Assistance of Invention of Experience and what a circumscribed Guide of it self  "For as it is with the Soldier in the Field let his own special Experience in Arms be never so an∣cient so true so sound yet without a more general Un∣derstanding or Theory and a more enlarged Knowledge than his particular and limited Experience can bring forth  he must be lamely fitted to many sudden and oft before unforeseen Occurrents which the perpetual Mutability and Change of Circumstances in Warfare must needs produce The Field the Enemy the Time not always the same require a divers and oft a contrary Consultation Design and Manner wherein one particular Experience by it self cannot but be much wanting because the same Thing or Action seldom or never happens again the same in all Circumstances and one Circumstance alone com∣monly altering the whole Condition As it is in Military Affairs so is it in the Assaults of Diseases where the Fight and Wrestling of Nature is not always in the same Part nor in the same Form or Manner nor with the same Disease nor of the same Period All which Circum∣stances in the same Subject cannot happen always to any Sight or Sense the same which makes Experience yet are ever present in the general Notions of the Under∣standing whereby the prudent and wise Man doth make supply tho' Experience fail"  Besides many Diseases a∣rise in the Body of Man which are scarce seen in a Man's Life and in which Experience can give no Prescription Here are mentioned the  French  Disease and the  Scurvy  strange to us once and the  English SweatingSickness  so now To these are added some more singular and un∣common Accidents as  Rulandus  his Report of the Golden Tooth which grew naturally in the Mouth of a Child Also another Child in  Hollerus  who thrust its hand out of its Mother's Navel for Days and was afterwards born alive and the Mother safe Also  Brasavola  's Cure of the Soldier who had almost half his Head cut away with part of his Brains Hence he descends to several Examples and Cases of his own Observation in  Northamptonshire  and con∣cludes from them that every Day almost may pose bare and naked Experience especially when Empericks apply it to similar Appearances  "For with the Wise the  like  is much unlike the  same  and it is a chief Point in all Learning truly to discern between differing Similitudes and like Differences Many Accidents fall out seeming alike yet have no Affinity and again in Shew the same yet indeed contrary Contraries have oft in many things Likeness and Likeness Contraries easily deceiving the Unwotting and Unlearned"  This again is proved by many Instances tending to demonstrate the Imperfections of their Practice who use no light of Judgment or Reason  but the only Sense of their own Experience With regard also to whom our Author says a little further  "I wou'd it were a Slander in these days that GoodWill and excel∣lent Medicines put to death more Lives than open Mur∣der" and thinks "it would be happy if at length the common Inconvenience and publick Scandal might be∣get a Law and Law bring forth Restraint"  Here also we have many Instances how helpless or hurtful good Medi∣cines are when apply'd without Distinction of proper Cir∣cumstances Concomitancies  c  intended to caution us against putting any confidence in the Excellency of any Re∣medies without Advice for the right Dispensation of them and consequently against relying upon the many Books of  Physical Receipts  and Apothecaries Shops in print which were then divulged in all Places wise and discreet Men knowing that Things without Reason in themselves are by Reason and Wisdom to be guided  Chap is  Of the Practice of  Women  about the Sick commonvisiting Counsellors and Commenders of Medicines  Wherein as vulgar Pretenders were before exclaimed a∣gainst for want of proper Education and Knowledge Pa∣tients are for the same Reason warned against consulting with  Petticoat Practitioners  who are rather advised to pre∣scribe Rules of  Conduct  to themselves than  Physick  to their Friends as what would free them from the Unhappiness of having their Hands so commonly in others Mishaps to the Dishonour of their own Sex by intimidating the Sick with Doubts and dissuading them if not from Physick ab∣solutely yet from the regular Composition and Use of it from all that is not of their own making or of which they have not had Tryal as their own Ointments Plaisters CearCloths  c  often beguiling them with the dangerous Flattery of harmless and palatable Medicines proving that old  Eve  will never be worn out of  Adam  's Children and not seldom rendring it incredible that such mean sort of People can get acquaintance with such dangerous Medicines as are here also specified but that Quacksalvers Bankrupt Apothecaries and fugitive Surgeons who every where over∣spread the Kingdom are compelled for gain to communi∣cate such Secrets whereby desperate Ingredients and Experi∣ments grow vulgar Medicaments Therefore  Chap Treats of  Fugitives Workers of Juggling Won∣ders and Quacksalvers  Under this Head we have a running Description of the Impostors here named  "Among these  Men says he "credulous Minds may see Things invisible Beggars are enabled to sell Gold to drink that want Silver to make them eat  Aurum Potabile  Our Author Dr  Cotta  who was educated at  Cambridge  here reflects upon Dr  Fra Anthonie  who at this time was noted for his  Universal Medicine  called  Aurum Potabile  whereof he publish'd a Book about four Years after and our Author an  An∣swer  to it as may be seen in  Athen Oxon  the  Natural Bal∣samum  the  Philosopher's Stone dissolved Pearl  and the like inestimable Glories and Pride of Art and Nature are their professed ordinary Creatures and the Workmanship of their Hands in whose hands are nothing but Idleness Theft and Beggary"  He concludes this Head with intimating that Pretenders to such uncommon Performan∣ces are to be suspected of wanting even common Suffi∣ciency That God has not ordain'd Wonders and Miracles to give supply to our common Needs or to answer the or∣dinary Occasions of Life nor do Truth and Sufficiency re∣ceive their just Trial by rare Works or casual Events but by an habitual and continual Proof and Exercise in their daily ordinary and proper Subjects and Occurrents  Chap is  Of Surgeons  and such as esteeming well of themselves for the Exercise of their Hands in Wounds Am∣putations  c  arrogate a Privilege in the Practice of Phy∣sick and even undertake to educate and institute Physicians as an Undergrowth to themselves and that thus also the World is furnished with Factors for the Grave Hereof he produces Examples manifesting by the Practice of these BarberSurgeons how confident Ignorance will be and how powerfully it will infatuate the Distressed And here again is arraign'd the Custom of giving the same Medicine to different Constitutions Whence says our Author  "How can he who considers the Disease and not the Per∣son in curing the one but in danger the other"  A little farther he lays down the plain and uncontrolled Difference between the Learned and the Unlearned in the Faculty and shews how the Learned has a Prerogative in three Parts to himself and an equal Part with the Unlearned in the fourth yet allows that in many desperate Cases the Igno∣rant by their Blindness their Boldness and their Luck may be the only fit Instruments Here we have also Examples how wonderous Good oft issues out of devilish and dange∣rous Acts yet if the Unskilful fail the hopeful Use of any  other Means is commonly thereby overrun and the Hap∣piness of Afterhealth by better Council frustrated Hence we are led to  Chap Of  Apothecaries  To whom thus much is al∣low'd That if any may have Prerogative to be Physicians by the Excellence and rare Choice of Medicines it is most proper unto them Nay 'tis further allow'd that for the excellent Preparation and Knowledge of Medicines they sometimes may excel some Physicians themselves  "But above and beyond the Preparation the right and judicious Dispensation is truly worthy commanding and directing therein safe and prudent Use This Skill requires an Un∣derstanding able to raise itself above both the Medicine and the Maker unto the Great Maker of them both and from his general Decree and Council in the Adminis∣tration of all things in Nature to levy and limit Circum∣stances Proportion Time Place Quantity and Qua∣lity according to the manifold Purposes and infinite Uses for the Preservation Conservation and Conti∣nuance of Health and Life to Mankind"  So far as the Apothecaries keep within their own proper Bounds they cannot be denied a worthy Esteem but if the Pride and Mastership of the Medicine stir once in them the Ambition of Medication they will be justly condemned A little further the Question is proposed whether a Physician should be both Surgeon and Apothecary himself And it is allow'd that in Judgment Skill Knowledge and Ability of Direc∣tion it may be requisite but the particular Execution should be divided to others whose continual Exercise therein makes them fitter for it and this Chapter is concluded with some further Remarks to the same Purpose  Chap  Of Practisers by Spells  Among the Arguments here used against these Deluders is this  "If the faithful and devout Prayer of Holy Men to which the Promise of God and Blessings of Men are annexed has no such As∣surance or Success of necessary Consequent without la∣borious Industry and the use of good Means how can Religion or Reason suffer Men who are not void of both to give such impious Credit unto an insignificant and senseless Mumbling of idle Words contrary to Reason without Precedent of any truly wise or learned and justly suspected of all sensibe Men"  Chap  Of Witchcraft in the Sick  c Herein are va∣rious Arguments advanced to prove there are many things  whereof few Men many whereof no Man can attain the Reason yet every Man knoweth to have a Reason in Nature That Casualty oft apts Consequences to Dreams yet it is no Proof of Truth to trust in them That Women in their Sleep have foreseen or foretold many Things which have come to pass but this makes their Dreams no Oracles and many vain Men have confidently predicted such Things as have happen'd yet are not taken for Prophets In like man∣ner some who have possess'd themselves with Witchcraft and the Opinion thereof have seemed to know Things a∣bove their Knowledge and That Knowledge above and beyond all Reason hath been true Yet neither is this any Dispossession of themselves of this Spirit of Folly nor just Proof or Accusation of any one to be a Witch Our Author does not deny or defend devilish Practices of Men and Women but desires only  "to moderate the general Madness of this Age which ascribes to Witchcraft what∣soever falls out unknown or strange to a vulgar Sense"  Therefore concerning Diseases there are here set forth some strange and particular Cases which had undergone unjust Imputations of this kind and one especially of a Gentlewoman whom certain Witches lately executed for Sorcery confess'd to have bewitch'd tho' her Malady was only a natural Complication of divers Disorders chiefly convulsive which produced a Concourse of Accidents seeming of monstrous and wondered Shapes Upon this says our Author I grant the voluntary and uncompelled or duly and truly evicted Confession of a  Witch  to be sufficient Condemnation of herself and therefore justly hath the Law laid their Blood upon their own Heads but their Confession I cannot conceive sufficient Eviction of the  Witchcraft  itself and this Topic is conluded with Arguments and Cautions further to the same Purpose  Chap  Of Wisards  These are described to be a sort of Practitioners whom our Custom and Country call Wise Men and Wise Women reputed a kind of honest harmless Witches or Wisards who by good Words hallowed Herbs Salves and other superstitious Ceremonies promise to allay and calm De∣vils Practices of other Witches and the Force of many Dis∣eases But these being much of the same Nature with those before mentioned to use Spells are referred unto them and dismiss'd with a short History of our Author's Observation  Chap  Of Servants to Physicians and ministring Help∣ers  Our Author concludes his Number and Distinction  of  Empericks  with this Tribe who are such as either by oft serving Physicians or conversing with them and viewing their Practice or by Employment from their Directions or by Attendance about the Sick engross to themselves sup∣posed special Observations and choice Remedies and with such small Ware taken upon credit set up for themselves Here the Insufficiency of such apish Imitation is descanted upon and this kind of secondhand Use of other People's Practice shewing in several Aphoristical Observations how unsafe such Experience in Physick is as  "how necessary it is That Man should be in himself a Master of Know∣ledge and sincere Judgment who shall be able truely to make right Use of another's Experience"  And even  "That which Experience has once or oft times known and found to do good must not therefore in necessity still do the same good except the same Reason of the good do in each Circumstance again commend and command it which only they can judge and examine who are wise and learned"  With other like Reflections therefore on this preposterous Practice and a Detail of such Abilities and Application as are requisite for attaining a suf∣ficiency in this Profession our Author concludes this Chap∣ter and therewith the  First Book  of this  Treatise  The fore∣going Extracts from which being sufficient to give a Taste of the Performance we shall for brevity sake only give the Titles of the two ensuing Books which are as follows  Book II Chapter  The Methodian learned Deceiver or Heretick Physician  Chapter  Of Beneficed Practisers  Chapter  Of Astrologers and Ephemerides Masters  Chap∣ter  Of Conjectors by Urine  Chapter  Of Travellers  Which ends this Book  Book III  The true Artist his right Description and Elec∣tion  In two Chapters which concludes the whole  X  Human Industry  or a  HISTORY  of most  MANUAL ARTS  deducing the  Original Progress  and  Improvement  of them Furnish'd with variety of  Instances  and  Examples  shew∣ing forth the Excellency of  Human Wit  Printed for  H Herringman  in  vo pages  THE Author of this learned Book has with great La∣bour join'd many dispersed Rarities of Art under se∣veral Heads with much Modesty brought a great deal of Reading into a little Compass and withall omitted to pre∣fix his Name to it Yet in justice to his Memory we have been obliged with it by another Hand  Anthony Wood  ascribes it to Dr  Tho Powell  Canon of  St David's  who was says he an able Philosopher a curious Cri∣tic and well vers'd in various Languages He died in  London Dec    There is a short Preface or Advertisement to the Reader seemingly by the Bookseller in Commendation of the Work wherein he says  You will imagine yourself even among the  Mechanic Arts  to be conversant in the  Liberal Tho' from the Defect of the alphabetical Catalogue intended at the beginning of the principal Authors mention'd in this Work with some Errors in the Table of Contents and the Omissions in the Index of any Reference to the Pages we might alone without any other Knowledge of the Author or the time when he died have presumed he did not supervise the Press yet are those Imperfections of little moment because the Work is concise  The Book itself is divided into twelve Chapters in the following Order  I  Of the Invention of Dials Clocks Watches and other TimeTellers  Here speaking of the Division of Time he tells you whence the Name of  Horae  or Hours was derived according to  Macrobius  and how the Day was divided into twentyfour Hours according to the  Egyptians  of the  Clyp∣sidrae  or Waterglasses of the Way to make the Motion of Time visible and audible first by the Invention of  SunDials  with an Observation from  Busbequius  that the  Turks  have no Distinction of Miles or Hours and that among the  Persians  their Bellies were their Dials upon what Defects the Invention of Engines by the  Trochilic  Art or that of Wheels arose and that  Severinus Boetius  was the first who contrived any Engine of this sort Then as to their Va∣riety some being mute some vocal some so small as to be worn in Rings for making whereof in  Italy  our Coun∣tryman  George Whitehead  is celebrated by  Schottus  in his Itinerary Then of  Andrew Alciat  's Clock which was both Larum and TinderBox Of Astronomical Clocks that at  Prague  serving also as an Almanac That at  Strasburgh  more particularly describ'd in  Coriat  's Travels The strange alphabetical Globe of our Countryman  Linne  a Jesuit of  Liege  which in a Waterglass would turn to an Index every Hour according to the Accounts of  Kercher de magnete  and  Gassendus  in the Life of  Peiriscus  The no less strange Cork of the said  Kercher  which with Seeds of the Helio∣trope in it would also in Water keep Course with the Sun He gives us one more Description of a SaddleClock at  Dresden  from  Morysin  's Travels So concludes this Head with a  Latin  Epigram by  Tho Campian  on a Watch with the Translation by  HV  i e  Vaughan  And an Observation from  Tycho Brahe  on a Defect in all Clocks and Watches in Watches for that the first half Hour goes faster than the last because Springs wound up move faster in the begin∣ning and in Clocks the last half Hour is faster than the first because their Weights move flower at first and ac∣celerate as they draw nearer the Earth  II  Of some curious Spheres and Representations of the World  This Chapter is introduced with a Praise of  Ar∣chimedes  and  Claudian  's Epigram on his Coelestial Sphere with a Translation of it by Mr  Nath Carpenter  Of King  Sapor's  GlassSphere The Emperor  Ferdinand  's silver Heaven which he presented to  Solyman  as mention'd by  Paul Jovius Sabellicus  and  Dubartas  Among the Moderns  Cornelius Van Drebble  of  Alcmar  is much admir'd He liv'd in  England  had a gold Chain sent him by the Emperor and was  Regi Jacobo à Mechanicis  King  James  his Engi∣neer He presented that King with a  Perpetual Motion  which is here describ'd and a Draught or Figure of it re∣ferr'd to in Mr  Tho Tims  's  Philosophical Dialogue  He is praised by  Marcellus Vrankheim  in an Epistle and his said Microcosm by  Grotius  in a  Latin  Epigram which you have here recited with  Vaughan  's Translation So concludes  with an Account of  Erasmus  his gold Ring which had a Coelestial Sphere in it and some Devices of  Janellus Tur∣rianus  of  Cremona  with which he used to recreate the Em∣peror  Charles  V as his brazen Heavens his little Armies of Horse and Foot his wooden Sparrows IronMill that turn'd itself and would grind as much Wheat in a Day as would suffice eight Persons with his WaterWorks whereby he drew up the River  Tagus  to the top of the Mountain of  To∣ledo  as we have it in  Strada  's History of the  LowCountry  Wars  III  Of sundry Machines and artificial Motions by Water and Air  In this having admir'd the wonderful Creation of the greater World and the lesser and instanced how many useful Machines and artificial Motions have been framed after those two primary  Automata  that God him∣self made he enumerates several Engineers ancient and modern who have been famous for such Works then pro∣ceeds to treat first of  WindMotions  whereof after men∣tioning what  Baptista Porta  and  Marinus Mersennus  had written upon this Subject he gives Examples in the wooden Dove of  Architas  the wooden Eagle of  Regiomontanus  and his Iron Fly the sailing Chariot of  Simon Stevinius  which would carry eight or nine Persons above forty Miles in two Hours 'Twas in the fashion of a Boat with four Wheels and two Sails It was much admir'd by  Peireskius  accord∣ing to  Gassendus  and here are two Epigrams of  Grotius  upon it with their Translations Then we have Accounts of Statues walking and speaking and the artificial Animals which  Luitprandus  saw at  Constantinople  the Statue of  Al∣bert Magnus  Friar  Bacon  's brazen Head and the vocal I∣mage in King  Richard  the Second's Reign whereof Sir  R Baker  speaks Then of  Cornelius Van Drebble  's Organ which would play of itself in the open Air and clear Sun∣shine but be silent in the Shade The Mill that would saw Boards without Hands at  Dantzick  and such another which Dr  John Dee  saw at  Prague  as he mentions himself Then he speaks of the  WindGuns Aeolii Scopoli  to discharge without Powder and  Aeoliae Pilae  or  WindBalls  to blow up or kindle Fires and  WindSpits  according to the Ac∣count of  Cardan  Then he comes to  WaterMotions  and here mentions the curious Mills at  Thoulouse  and  Dantzick  from the Accounts of  Golnitz  and  Morison  also the Mint at  Segovia  which perform'd the several Operations of coin∣ing by a WaterEngine as Sir  K Digby  relates the Statues  in the Duke of  Florence  's Garden with their various Motions and Harmony also the Birds at  Tivoli  which sing by the same  Hydraulic  Art Of WaterOrgans and the vast Sce∣nery of Woods Beasts Waters and Shipping in the  Roman  Amphitheatres The  Versatile  DiningRooms where every Course is eaten in a different Chamber the Guests never removing from their Seats Next is mentioned the por∣table Palace carried to  France  for the Interview between  Henry  VIII and  Francis  I which so many Writers have spoken of tho' we think not that it is here placed under its proper Head and lastly a more distinct Account of  Mem∣non  's Statue its musical Property even when it was broke and the Conjecture of  Kircher  that it was made by  Talisma∣nic  Art  Of this Art see  Marcil Ficinus de Vitâ coelitus comparanda Jos Scaliger Epist  and  Gregory  's  Opuscula  tho' he shews that such Effects might be pro∣duced by Mathematical Contrivance in his  Oedipus  where more Examples may be seen of  Pneumatical  Devices among the  Aegyptians  in their Temples  IV  Of the Art and Mystery of Writing with the Instruments  This he begins with shewing what a vast number of dif∣ferent ways the Alphabet may be joined according to  Clavius  That the  Chinese  have Letters according to  Purchas  and that the  Indians  admir'd this dumb Commerce so as to believe that Letters were Spirits or a kind of  Internuncii  between the Correspondents and to this sense quotes  Tho Readi Inventa adespota  Of the Invention attributed to  Cad∣mus  by the  Phoenicians  as we have it in  Ausonius  and  Her∣mannus Hugo  Of the admirable Perfection which the an∣cient  Librarians  arrived to in the Art of Writing and seve∣ral Examples of their Performance in Miniature particularly that of  Fra Alumnus  according to the Testimony of  Gene∣brand  and  Sim Maiolus Pliny  's Account of  Homer  's  Iliad  in a Nutshell and  Cicero  's Confirmation however  Lancelotti  reckons it among his  Farfalloni  Of  Tho Sweicker  the  Dutch  Writer with his Feet and how choicely some Copies of his said Writing are kept according to  Fel Platerus  and of an  English  Woman who wrote in the same manner Of  Brachygraphy  or  Shorthand  for Speed and Privacy invented by  Mecaenas  according to  Dion  and used by  Cicero  Of  Julius Caesar  's invention which was a kind of  Cryptography  by Transposure of the Alphabet That the  Instruments  are  active  and  passive  being those  wherewith  and those  whereon  we write And first of those whereon we write as Stone  on which the old  Jewish  Law was wrote and some antique  Danish  Records as mentioned by  Selden  in  Marmora Arun∣dell  Then on Leaves of Trees as the  Sybils  Books and the  Indians  whence the word  Folio  On Lead as in  Job  and the Poems of  Hesiod  in  Pausanias  and on the inner Rhind of Trees whence the words  Liber Caudex  and  Codex  On Papyr Reeds as in  Isaiah  whence Paper which Reed was called  Biblus  whence  Biblia  On Tables of Brass as the  Roman  Laws on Waxen Tables whence  Tabellarii  or LetterCarriers which Tables are mentioned in St  Luke  and in  Isaiah  and in the  Septuagint  called BoxTables also sometimes made of CedarWood Of the Invention of Vellum and Parchment by  Eumenes  King of  Pergamus  And lastly of our modern Paper with Lord  Bacon  's Obser∣vations on the Excellence of the said Invention Of the Cotton Paper in  Mexico  and Silk Paper in the  EastIndies  Next of the  Active Instruments  as the Finger of God on the Tables of Stone Graving Tools for Metals and Dia∣monds for Glass the  Stylus  for Waxen Tables the Reed called  Calamus Scriptorius  and  Arundo  for writing on the Papyr Seggs about  Memphis  as mentioned in  Martial  and lastly the Quill of a Bird's Wing for Parchment and Paper called by  Ausonius Fissipes  from the Slit made in it to let down the Ink and four Lines in its Praise by  Barlaeus de Penna  with the notice taken of these three last in an old Chronicle Of writing with corroding Waters by the Cut∣lers of  Damascus  on the  Turkish  Scimeters and of the long lasting of a Pen in the Example of Dr  Holland  's the Phy∣sician of  Coventry  wherewith he translated all  Pliny  's  Natu∣ral History  into  English  which therefore was preserved by a Lady as a great Rarity in a Silver Case and  Ovid  's Silver Pen which being found in some Ruins was given to the Queen of  Hungary  in according to Mr  Sandys  in the Life of that Poet  V  Of Printing and PrintingPresses  Here we have the Commendations of  Pol Virgil Cardan  and  Read  before mentioned in Prose and Verse of this Art The Conten∣tion of  higher  and  lower Germany  for the Invention of it The general Voice for  Mentz  and  John Guttemberg  or  Fust  The learned Dr  Will Cuningham  who was in these parts of  Germany  in or before the Year and conversant with the most learned Men there says in his foregoing Treatise fol  "That at this City of  Mentz  was the Art of Printing first found by  John Faustus  in the Year of Christ our Saviour "  about the Year according to  Polydore  The  Evidence of the  Tully  's  Offices  cited by  Salmuth  upon  Pan∣cirollus  another Instance from the Library at  Francfort  with the Opposition of  Adrian Junius  who would carry it from the  High Dutch  and make the Town of  Harlem  its Birthplace and  LaurenceJohn    Coster  the Inventor from his Rudiments thereof carved out of the Barks of Trees which  Junius  saw in that Town with his Account how  John Faustus  stole away  Coster  's Letters and Utensils and settling at  Mentz  printed the  Doctrinal  of  Alex Gallus  Also the Description over  Coster  's House justifying the same and  Pet Scriverius  his Confirmation thereof with  Jo Scaliger  's Account of the first Printing from Wooden Tables That the  Chinese  may plead Antiquity for the In∣vention according to  P Maffaeus  and that they have prac∣tised the Art above Years as  Trigaultius  affirms but differently from the  Europeans  for they do not compose by Letters but make for every Leaf a Table with Charac∣ters on both sides as  Gonsalvo Mendoza  observes So that the Invention of the modern manner may still be allowed in honour of the  Germans  Our Author then mentions a  Latin  Poem written in praise of this Art which it well deserves being the Preserver of all other Arts by Mrs  Joan Eliza∣beth Weston  one of the Muses of  England  And lastly gives a description of  Christopher Plantin  's PrintingHouse his twelve Presses and near sorts of Characters besides Frontispieces  c  and tells us that the first PrintingPress in  England  was set up in  WestminsterAbbey  by  Simon Islip An  where  William Caxton  first practised the Art as  Stow  affirms in his  Survey of London  VI  Of the Art of Limning and Painting  This Chapter commences with Praises of the Art by Sir  Henry Wotton  St  Gregory  c The Reason why  Death's Dance  was painted in the Church at  Basil  How simple the Art was at first according to  Aelian  but encreased to ten Colours as  Bu∣lenger  observes who it was added the  Ethick  part of Paint∣ing and first expressed the Passions The Excellence of  Apelles  and  Protogenes Zeuxes  and  Parrhasius  the Virgin  Lala  and  Renè  King of  Sicily  Of some modern Rarities as the representing in one Piece several Faces according to different Position or Standing by pleated Paper and in∣denting or folding of the Table others that shewed the Head of a  Spaniard  one way another way that of an Ass a  third in the Chancellor of  France  's Cabinet which presented many little Faces his Ancestors to the vulgar Eye but thro' a Perspective the single Portrait only of the Owner according to Sir  Rich Fanshaw  in the  Epist  before his Translat of  Pastor Fido  Of Painting in Oil with the Art of Sculpture and Engraving Of other Perspective Pieces The Art of  Myron  and Imagery of  Lysippus  Of  Michael Angelo  and his three Perfections  Albert Durer Vandick  so famous in  London  who attain'd to great Wealth by his Art and  Paul Rubens  whose Table of the  Last Judgment  was valued at five thousand  Florins  Of  Annealing  or paint∣ing in Glass and  Bulenger  's erroneous Opinion that it was known to the Ancients from a Distich in  Martial  Of the  Aegyptian  Pictures stain'd in Linnen Cloth Pictures woven in Cloth as in Carpets and TapestryWork first taught by the  Babylonians  according to  Pol Virgil  and rival'd by the ArrasWorkers in  Flanders  Of  Mosaick  Work with co∣loured Stones Metals and Glass in all Figures known to the Ancients according to  Pliny  and  Bulenger de Pictura Statuaria  Lastly of the Picture of  Laoco  mentioned in  Virgil  and  Pliny  preserved in the Palace at  Rome  and ad∣mired by  M Angelo  VII  Of the Art of Spinning and Weaving with the seve∣ral Materials of Garments  After a Word or two on the In∣vention of this Art ascribed to  Minerva  we are inform'd of a rare selfmoving Engine at  Dantzick  which would weave four or five Webs at a time and without human help work night and day which yet in favour of the poor Weavers was suppressed and the Inventor secretly destroy'd according to  Lancelotti  He next speaks of the primitive Attire of Figleaves and  Paul  the Hermit's Suit of Palmleaves the Skins of Beasts  Arachne's  Excellence in Spin∣ning the several sorts of Materials whereof Cloth is woven as the  NettleCloth  that of the  Palmleaves  of the Bark of the  Maguei  among the  Mexicans  which bears the  Coco  here describ'd from  Du Bartas  and of the  Pumpion  brought from  Mecha  whereof  Peireskius  had a kind of Silk woven as  Gassendus  relates in his Life besides which there is no  Se∣ricum Vegetabile  according to our Author for that Silk properly is made by and from the SilkWorm as  Julius Scaliger  against  Cardan  shews of which  Pliny  inserts many a moral Lesson among his Observations It is next ob∣served that  Pamphilia  first wove Silks that the Emperor  M Aurel Antoninus  first wore them in  Europe  and that  the Worm was first brought into this Quarter by certain Monks in  Justinian  's Time That in the  SummerIslands  there are large beautifulcolour'd Spiders which spin perfect raw Silk as  Oviedo  and Captain  Smith  relate Of other Garments made with Hair such as the Prophets wore Grograms of Goat's Hair whereof  Busbequius  gives a more particular Account and Chamlets of Camel's Hair as we may further read in  Aelian  Of Flax and Hemp that they were first dress'd in  Egypt  and that the  Egyptian  and  Jewish  Priests wore their Vestments thereof also of Cotton which grows in Balls on certain Shrubs Next of the fine Linnen made in  Holland  and  Cambray  whence called Hollands and Cambricks which  Adrian Junius  describes to be as white as snow as fine as Lawn and as dear as Silk Of the SeaWool spoken of by  Tertullian  as fine as Silk according to  La Cerda  which is made of the downy Substance growing out of the large Shellfish call'd  Pinna  Also a kind of StoneCloth made from certain Stones here named which are beaten into small Fibres or Hairs and so woven it is call'd by  Langius  Salamander's Wool having the property of re∣sisting Fire  Ferdinand Imperatus  had of it in his  Museum  and  Callimachus  hung up a Taper of it in the Temple of  Mi∣nerva  according to  Salmasius  But there is a Vegetable of the same property call'd by the  Greeks Asbastos  which  Pliny  calls  Linum vivum  or incombustible Flax and says the Car∣casses of Kings were wrapt in it when they were to be burn'd to preserve their Ashes for the Urns  Podocatter  who wrote  de Rebus Cypriis  in had of this Cloth which was seen by  Tho Porcacchius  as he relates in his  Funeral Rites Ludovicus Vives  saw the like at  Lovain  as he also relates and  Baptista Porta  at  Venice  as may be read in his  Nat Magia  Mettals were also wrought into Cloth such were the  Attalic  Garments call'd by the  Italians Veste di Brocato di Oro  and when the marble Coffin of  Mary  the Wife of the Emperor  Honorius  was dug up at  Rome  in tho' her Body was consumed and turned to dust all but her Teeth and Bones her golden Apparel was fresh out of which was extracted Pound weight of pure Gold as  Aldrovand  records in his  Musaeum Metallicum  The  Si∣donians  had also such Vestments as may be seen in  Virgil  Aen xi But the strangest of all was that kind of Wool mention'd by St  Hierom  and  Paulus Diaconus  to have rained down from the Clouds about  Artois  in  Flanders  whereof Cloth was spun to the great Enrichment of the Country  So that as there was once  Coelum escatile  as  Salvian  speaks of the wonderful  Manna  in like manner there was now  Coelum textile  as we may term it the Sky affording both Food and Rayment To this Chapter is join'd an  Appendix  of  The Plumary Art  Here it is observ'd to what Perfec∣tion this Art was arrived in  Florida  and other Parts of the  WestIndies  where such Birds of  Orient  Plumage abound as the  Phenicopter Parrot  and  Tomincio  With the manner how they strip the Quills and paste on the Feathers in all Shapes and Shades What delicate Works of this kind  Fer∣dinand Cortez  saw in the Emperor  Motizuma  's Palace at  Mexico  That Cardinal  Paleotti  had the Picture of St  Hie∣rom  of this Workmanship and that certain Fryers had learnt the Art That it was not unknown even to the Ancients That St  Hierom  mentions it also  Julius Fermicus Pruden∣tius  and  Seneca  That these Plumes surpass all the Beauties of the Pencil not only in Lustre but Duration and foil the Art of Painting  VIII  Of the Art of Musick with the Instruments  c From the  Pythagorean  Notion of Musick in the Spheres the Delight of Man's Soul in Harmony is here accounted for according to  Macrobius  also from the Body of Man which is a living Organ and Life itself the Lesson which his Soul plays thereon That vocal Musick is most delight∣ful That  Pan  devised the Imitation of this musical Pipe in the Throat of Man with a  Syringe  or Reed tho'  Lucretius  ascribes it to the whistling of the  Zephyrs  in the Reeds That in Imitation of them the Shankbones of Cranes were used whence came the  Flute  Not but musical Instruments were in the World before  Pan  's Time  Jubal  being the In∣ventor of the  Harp  and  Organ  That the  Egyptian Mercury  invented the Lyre or Lute by a Tortoiseshell he found on the  Nile  side to which some Nerves hung reaching from end to end whereof  Du Bartas  has taken notice That  Terpander  encreased the Lyre from three Strings to seven  Simonides  added an eighth and  David  mentions a tenstring'd Instrument who invented many sorts but all are divided into such as are founded either by the  Breath  or  Hand  Since his Time many have been the Improvements  Leander Al∣berti  in his Description of  Italy  relates that he saw a pair of Organs in which Men would think they heard Boys and Men distinctly sing their Parts in Concert and another Pair in the Duke of  Mantua  's Court made all of  Alabas∣ter  which gave a loud and full Sound also another very  musical Pair at  Venice  made all of Glass which are men∣tion'd by  Moryson  in his Travels Pope  Sylvester  the Se∣cond made a Pair that would play without any other Organist than warm Water Such  Hydraulics  frequent in  Italy  are sounded also with cold Water  Gaudentius Merula de Mi∣rab Mundi  mentions an Organ at  Milan  the Pipes where∣of were made of various Materials as Wood Brass White∣lead and imitated various musical Instruments Speaking next of vocal Musick natural and artificial the Scarcity of good natural Singers is observ'd occasioning the Supply of musical Instruments for Delight and to appease the Cares of Life Hence we are led to an  Appendix Of the Power and Efficacy of Musick  The Commendations of  Orpheus  by  Horace  and  Claudian  and of  Silenus  by  Virgil  with  Tho Ran∣dolph  's Exhortation to Musick finely illustrating the Force thereof upon Rocks and Trees Thus leaving things  in∣animate  he proceeds to Instances of the Regency of Mu∣sick over Creatures  rational  and  irrational  among other Authorities he produces that of  Henry Stephens  who says in  Pref ad Herod  that he saw a Lion at  London  which would forsake his Food to hear Musick The Delight which Deer and Elephants take therein and that the Ass only is not pleased with it That Birds likewise are affected with Mu∣sick and Hawks tamed therewith That it rules also in the Water as in the famous Story of  Arion  and the Dolphin and was expected to prevail over Hell itself as in the at∣tempt made for the Recovery of  Eurydice  with a Compli∣ment to  Spenser  out of  W Brown  's Pastorals attesting that if  Orpheus  had been but half his equal he had not left her in those infernal Regions Then for rational Creatures here are many Examples produced to shew how Musick has all our Passions at Command how Courage and Fear have been raised by it how Anger has been stirr'd up and al∣lay'd by it how it exhilarates and enlivens the Spirits in∣spires Devotion Chastity and Civility with an Instance of the effect of  Dactyls  and  Spondaics  That Musick has also power over the Body to keep it from drooping and wea∣riness and cure it of Maladies of this latter we have many particulars as the Cure of the Plague in  Homer  by Musick of the Frensy by  Zenocrates  of the  Sciatica  from the Ex∣perience of  Theophrastus  and some Aches as reported in  France  The poisonous Bite of the  Tarantula  in  Italy  that kind of Frensy call'd  St Vitus  his Dance in  Germany  in which upon hearing of a Fiddle the Patient dances till he is tired  and cured as  Skenkius  observes Hence we proceed to the Musick of Speech and Eloquence Of the  Grecian  Orators who had the power of Fire and Water to inflame and ex∣tinguish to make Peace and War Then of some Moderns as  Savanorola  who managed the Commonwealth with his Tongue and  Ugolin  the Friar who by a Sermon moved his Audience to beat their Enemies And if plain Speech has such power how much more must Words join'd with Harmony and Numbers Here we have a Summary of all the foremention'd Effects of Musick in some Verses of  Du Bartas  which is follow'd by  Baptista Porta  's nice Attempt to ascribe the wonderful Effects of Musick to the Vertues of the several sorts of Trees whereof the Instruments are made which says he have a secret Property to cure Dis∣eases more than the Sounds that are made of them But our Author thinks him mistaken because bare Words have power over Men's Minds and Spirits so shews us more dis∣tinctly from  Scaliger  how the Vibration or trembling of the Air by Musick affects the Spirits of Man This is further strengthen'd by the affinity between the Soul and Musick observ'd by  Aristotle  and  Macrobius  and the Argu∣ment of its being no wonder that every Creature which has a living Soul should be taken with Musick since the Soul of the Universe whereof every particular Soul is a Part is made of  Harmony  This Head is concluded with an Exam∣ple of the Force of Eloquence in  Pericles  from  Val Maxi∣mus  and in the Philosopher  Hegesias  who so pathetically set forth the Evils of Life that his Auditors resolv'd to kill themselves according to  Cicero  IX  Of the Invention of Glass and GlassWorks  We are here inform'd of the Ingredients whereof Glass is made by what Accident it was invented from  Pliny  and  Josephus  the Properties of it how fluid and ductile while hot how hard clean and clear when cold how broken by Poisons excessive Cold or Heat How Art in forming of it imi∣tates the Creation it being made with the Breath of the Mouth How preciously it is esteem'd of in some Coun∣tries where it is exchanged for Gold according to  Pigafetta  Where the best are made near  Venice  and how Tho' ours is so brittle that an Artist at  Rome  in  Tiberius  his Time could make it malleable and flexible and that he was secretly made away lest the Knowledge of his Art should make Gold contemptible Then we come to the Uses of Glass in Cups and Vessels LookingGlasses Telescopes  Microscopes Thermometers Spheres Spectacles where∣by old Eyes become young small Objects are magnified things invisible seen and things behind us brought before and those done in our Neighbour's Houses or Enemy's Tents brought to our Knowledge without the help of Ma∣gic for which we are referr'd to  Baptista Porta  Then we advance more to Particulars as that  Cornelius Van Drebble  that rare Engineer of  Alcmar  who liv'd here in K  James  's Court invented the Microscopes whereby we discover the subtilest Objects and the smallest And that  Sanctorius  a famous Physician of  Padua  invented the Thermometers which in a Man's Chamber discover the Temper of the Air whether hot or cold moist or dry or inclining to ei∣ther That Telescopes for discovering things afar off were invented by  Jacobus Metius  of  Alcmar  as  Des Cartes  tells us and perfected by  Gallileo Gallilei  the  Florentine  which will represent Objects thirty times bigger than the ap∣parent Quantity and a hundred times nearer than the appa∣rent Distance By these new Stars have been discover'd and new Worlds in them the Moon brought down to Ex∣amination and found to be another  America  By these  Telesius  has given us his  Selenographia  or Description of the Countries and Provinces there and  Van Drebble  saw not only the Hills and Plains but the Forests Cities and Build∣ings in this Lunary World as  Gassendi  has written in his Life of  Peiresk  And as for BurningGlasses we have here the Account of the  Roman  Ships fired by  Archimedes  at  Sy∣racuse  from  Plutarch  's Life of  Marcellus  and those of  Vi∣talianus  fired by  Proclus  with such Glasses who thereby de∣fended  Constantinople  as  Zonaras  records and those where∣with our learned Countryman  Roger Bacon  Vir tam vastae doctrinae ut  Anglia  imo Orbis ea re nihil haberet simile aut secundum  Vossius  de Artibus popular Artis Magnae Lib  offer'd the Pope to annoy the  Turks  more than all the Galleys of  Italy  or an Army of a Hundred Thousand Men could do as  Gaffarel  from others relates  Kircher  indeed could never hit upon the Experiment or hear of Glasses that would burn above fifteen Paces distance but  Baptista Porta  declares there is a way to make Glasses that would burn things at any distance and Dr  John Dee  in the Preface to his  Monas Hieroglyphica  that it may be made to calcine Stones and reduce them to powder After this we come to a Remark or two on the Spheres of  Archimedes  which represented the Motion of the  heavenly Bodies and is described by  Claudian  with the Dis∣tinction of  Kircher  that the outside only was of Glass yet  Peter Ramus  speaks of two Glass Spheres at  Paris  like those of  Archimedes  Next we have an Observation on the Am∣phitheatre of Glass in  Pliny  which was a kind of Fossile or  Obsidian  Glass found in  Aethiopia  black transparent and easily wrought of which was built the stately Tomb in  Alexandria  by  Ptolemy  for  Alexander  as  Strabo  relates  Herodotus  also tells us this kind of Glass was wrought hol∣low to case or enshrine dead Bodies that they might be seen The specular Stone was of this kind but brighter and like Crystal It was also used to shelter Fruits from blighting Colds But this kind of Stone is return'd by  Pan∣cirollus inter non inventa Leander  mentions a compleat Galley of Glass at  Venice  and Glass Organs  James Howel  saw such a Galley at the  Murano  as he writes in his  History of  Venice As Glass is diaphanous and passive to Objects so it is also reflective and beats back the Objects which fall upon it when the backside is lin'd with Tinsoil or Leaf of Tinsilver or other Metal and thus LookingGlasses are made wherewith many strange Feats may be perform'd even to the Suspicion of Magic and unlawful Arts  X  The Invention of Shipping Sailing and the Mariner's Compass  This Invention of riding on the blue Roads with wooden Horses as the old comic Poet phrases it was highly bold as  Horace  expresses it and no less useful as all the World have found it The Motives to such Hazard are shewn from the Book of  Wisdom  to be Desire of Gain in Man and a Willingness in God that the Works of his Wis∣dom should not lie idle But we shall admire such Boldness the more in considering the Simplicity of Sailing in the first Ages when the  Aegyptians  made their Boats of Reeds and Rushes according to  Pliny  and  Lucan  such was that in which  Moses  was preserv'd such is spoken of in  Isaiah  also among the  Indians  according to  Herodotus  The old  Britains  had their  Naves Vitiles  says  Pliny  the  Irish  their  Corraghes  being made of Wicker cover'd with Leather not much bigger than a Basket such  Strabo  says he sail'd to  Egypt  in such were those which  Caesar  learnt to make of the  Britains  and such were used by the  Babylonians  as tes∣tifies  Herodotus  And they were so light that the Master could carry them on Shore as they carried him at Sea like the  Arabian  Fisherman whose TortoiseShell was his Shal∣lop by Water and his House by Land as  Dubartas  has it  from a  Latin  Epigram Such like also for lightness the  Aegyptians  use on the  Nile  and  Boterus  mentions such again in the  WestIndies  where they have also their  Balsa's  or Bulrushes rafted together and row to fish in the main Sea upon them as may be read in  Acosta  The  Indians  have likewise their Canoes made out of one Tree hollowed and in  Greenland  Boats shaped like a Shuttle covered with SealSkins and rib'd with Bones of Fishes as  Purchas  describes  Pet Gellius  in his Description of the  Thracian Bosphorus  speaks of a Ship he saw laden with  A∣rabian  Merchandize which had no Iron in it but was sewed together with Cords covered with Rosin of the Frank∣incenceTree and her Tackling made of the Tree which bears the  Indian  Nut which Mr  Geo Herbert  describes But the  Tyrians  are reputed the first who improved Shipping with Masts Sails  c  and  Ovid  tells us that  Jason  was the first Contriver of Ships and that his famous  Argo  was stelli∣fied by Astronomers The ShellFish called  Nautilus  gave the first Hint of framing a Ship according to  Pliny  as the flying of the Kite did of the Stern afterwards they were magnificently made as that Cedar Galley built by  Caligula  which had Halls Rooms and Gardens in it and that of  Ptolemaeus Philopater  who built one two hundred eighty Cubits long fifty two Cubits from the Bottom to the upper Decks had four hundred Banks for four thousand Rowers with Gardens and Orchards at top of it as  Plutarch  relates in his Life of  Demetrius  But the Improvement of Navi∣gation without Sails or Oars so as never to be windbound was more commendable We have the Account in  Vitruvius  that for this end the Ancients had in their Ships three Wheels on each side with eight  radii  a Span long projecting from each Wheel and six Oxen within turning the same which casting the Water backward moved the Ship on with great Speed They had also an Instrument in those Ships called  Carrum  dividing the Hours of the Day Lord  Bacon  in his  Novum Organum  speaks of Boats in  England  to sail under Water and  Julius Scaliger  of a Ship he could make that would steer herself This Chapter ends with the famous Re∣presentation of a Naval Fight in  Claudius Caesar  's time men∣tioned by  Suetonius  and  Juvenal  's Account of the Earthen Boats used in  Aegypt  So we proceed to the  Appendix of the Mariners Compass  wherein we are inform'd that  John Goia  or  Flavius Goia  of  Amalphi  in  Campania  in the King∣dom of  Naples  first invented the Compass who is therefore  celebrated by  Du Bartas  By what Stars Pilots were di∣rected before the said Invention and Travellers in the De∣serts of  Arabia  and how they were oblig'd to stop when the Sky was clouded therefore our Author says of the Loadstone as  Rablais  of the Milstone that 'tis the most precious of all others Then follows  Claudian  's Description of the  Magnet  its two Properties of  Attraction  and  Direction  which gave Invention to the Mariners Compass whose Needle touched therewith points its LillyHand to the North in any part of the World The Inhabitants of  Taprobana  having not the  PoleStar  to sail by carried certain Birds on board which being set at liberty flew by natural Instinct to the Shore so gave direction to the Sailors according to  Pliny  The  Sy∣rians  and the  Bactrians  according to  Curtius  travelled by the Guidance of Stars but the  Arabians  says  Lud Bartema  in certain Wooden Boxes on their Camels have the Load∣stone like the Compass to steer their Course by over the Desarts Some ascribe this Invention to the  Chinese  and Dr  Gilbert de Magnete lib  affirms that  Paulus Venetus  brought it first into  Italy An  having learnt it from them  Ludovicus Vertomanus  reports that he saw about the Year the  Indian  Pilot of his Ship sailing in  Java  steer by a Compass made as in  Europe  This Head is con∣cluded with a Remark that our Compass is not yet brought to due Perfection for that the  Magnetic  Needle does not yet point exactly to the North in all Meridians to the cause of much Error in Navigation  Van Helmont  professes a way to rectify this Inconvenience which tho' somewhat fanciful as appears by our Author's Account of it 'tis yet to be wish'd some Devices might be found to amend that Imper∣fection  XI  The Art of Cicuration and taming of wild Beasts  It appears by the Introduction of this Chapter that we have not the same Title to this Book which our Author intended and that he had call'd it  Historia Naturae Subactae  therefore thinks this Chapter no Digression He begins with a Quo∣tation from the New Testament shewing that  every kind of Beast is tamed by Mankind  gives seveval Examples of the Elephant and refers to many Stories of their Officiousness and Docility in one of  Lipsius  his Epistles and of the Lion out of  Pliny  that Tygers drew the Coach of  Bacchus  from  Silius Italicus  and that of  Heliogabalus  as  Lampridius  re∣lates  Martial  mentions the same in  Domitian  's time that the fierce  Byson  and Stag were taught to do the same and  at  Walton  upon  Thames  our Author saw four Stags draw a small Coach  Lipsius  in his Notes upon  Tacitus  speaks of Dogs drawing a Chariot at  Rome  and  Textor  of Os∣triches that drew the Coach of the Emperor  Firmus  The Emperor  Maximilian  the second had a Deer which would receive a Bridle and a Rider and run against the fleetest Horse as  Mich Neander  relates  Martial  mentions also a Deer used to a Bridle and  Camden  in his Annals of Q  Elizabeth  that Sir  Hierom Bowes  brought from  Muscovia  certain  Does  of admirable Swiftness which being yoked and coupled in a Coach would carry a Man with great Speed Next we have an Account of tame Panthers Leopards and Lions to hunt with as the King of  Cambala  's which  Aelian  mentions and  Scaliger  and Mr  Moryson  speaks of Leopards so tame that they would leap up behind the Huntsman on his Horse and sit like a Dog and soon dispatch a Hart which shews the Excellence of Man's Abilities to subdue other Creatures but as  Xenophon  observes it is far easier taming any Creature than Man and  Seneca  has a Reflection to the same purpose that no Creature is so wayward fierce and untractable as Man We have next an Account from  Strabo  of a Crocodile that had been tamed and Dragons mentioned by  Seneca  to have crept tamely upon Men's Tables among their Cups and of a fourlegged Serpent in  Cairo  grown familiar and harmless Many Instances of Birds as Ostriches drawing a Coach Eagles enured to fly at Fowl like Hawks a Crow taught to fly at Partridges and WildDucks made Decoys Of SeaAnimals the  Mannti  or SeaCow is instanced from  Peter Martyr  the SeaHorse from  Leo Afer  and the Fish called  Reversus  by which the  Indians  caught others as is related by  Bodin  in his  Theatrum Naturae  also by  Purchas  and  P Martyr Pliny  's Dolphins which would suffer Correction like SettingDogs as  Oppian  also testifies and of Otters taught to drive Fish into the Net according to  Cardan  Also several Examples of Wild Beasts tamed for Sport and Pleasure as well as Service such were the Dancing Camels which  Leo  saw and the Elephants which danced on the Ropes in  Seneca  with the manner of teaching them upon a hot Floor from  Sandys  in his Travels The Elephant  Busbequius  saw at  Constantinople  which danced and play'd at Ball The Bear which danced to the Musick of his own Tabor and then begg'd for Reward seen by  Neander  The Dance of Horses at the Marriage of the Duke of  Florence  attested by Sir  K Digby  and the Ass seen by  Leo  in  Africa  which would  vie Feats with  Banks  his Horse that rare Master of the  Ca∣ballistic  Art Here we have a Story of the dangerous Effects of such Dancing Horses among the  Sabarites  when their Enemies the  Crotonians  brought Musick into the Field of Battle from  Diodorus Siculus Aelian  and  Pliny  To shew that a Baboon has play'd upon the Guittar and a Monky at Chess we are referr'd to  Balt Castilione  Of Birds are mentioned the Talking Starlings Pyes and Crows at  Rome  Cardinal  Ascanio  's Parrot would say the  Creed  and another in  Spain  which would sing the  Gamut  as  John Barnes  an  English  Frier relates in his learned Book  de Aequivocatione  Many of these Examples are sum'd up by  Martial  in his Book of  Shows Epig  which is here recited with a Transla∣tion Lastly it is observed how Animals will learn the Language of their Country so far as is necessary for their Direction as Elephants Horses and Mules which  Claudian  has taken notice of and that Dogs have been trained for the Wars by the old  Britons  and  Gauls  as  Strabo  and  Camden  relate so have Bulls Bears and Lions according to  Lucre∣tius  here cited This with some other Citations from  Grotius Plutarch  and  Origen  shewing that the Wit and Reason of Man reduces all other Creatures to his Service and Subjection concludes this Chapter  XII  Of certain Sports and Extravagancies of Art  In this last Chapter of the Book it is set forth that as Nature has her  Ludicra  so has Art and that Art as well as Nature is never more wonderful than in smaller Works That St  Augustine  admired as much at the Tooth of a Moth as that of an Elephant So we descend to Particulars as the Ivory Ants of  Callicrates  the little Ivory Chariot Horses and Dri∣ver of  Myrmecides  to be cover'd with the Wings of a Fly and the Ship with all her Tackling which a Bee could hide according to  Pliny  and  Aelian  Next are  Vulcan  's Nets mentioned out of  Ovid  The Waggon and Oxen of Glass which might be concealed by a Fly in  Cardan  and the neat little Wooden Lock mentioned by  Leander Alberti  which introduces the rare Workmanship of  Mark Scaliot  a Blacksmith of  London  in his Iron Lock and Key and Gold Chain of forty three Links all drawn by a Flea and all with the Flea weighing but one Grain and a half as witnesses  John Stow  in his  Annals  who saw it  Scaliger  also men∣tions a Flea with a Gold Chain and  Leo Afer  such a Chain for which the Artist had a Suit of Cloth of Gold bestowed upon him by the  Sultan Hadr Junius  saw at  Mechlin  a  Basket made of a CherryStone which held fourteen pair of Dice whose Spots were visible Then we have notice taken of the precious Stone in a Ring representing  Phaeton  his Chariot and Steeds tumbling into the River as men∣tion'd in  Galen  and  Geo Whitehead  's Ship with all her Tackling moving of itself on a Table with Rowers a Wo∣man playing on the Lute a Whelp howling  c  as affirmed by  Schottus  in  Itin Italiae  also  Gafferell  's Account in his  Unheard of Curiosities  of the Clock at  Leghorn  which had on it a Company of Shepherds playing on the Bagpipes with others dancing by Couples thereto in Time and Measure Here is also mentioned the Chain in  Cardan  so little and so light that when it fell to the Ground it would not break tho' made of Glass and the Iron Spider in  Walchius  's ninth Fable to which our Author applies the Verses in  Dubartas  celebrating the Iron Fly of  Regiomontanus  also the Bear and Lion of Gold presented to the  Landgrave  of  Hesse  each a MiddleFinger's Length and both weighing but a  French  Crown for which the Artist was rewarded with three thou∣sand Crowns This is followed with  Claudian  's Epigram  de Quadriga Marmorea  and the Translation and the whole Book concludes with a Reference to many more Instances of the like nature in  John Tradescant  's Ark at  Lambeth  and the Archives of several Princes and private Persons who have their  Pinacotheca  's and  Technematophylacia  to preserve all Rarities more particularly that of  Bernard Paludanus  a Physician in  Holland  upon which here is an Epigram quoted and Information of another among  Grotius  's Poems to the same purpose  XI  Charismatum Sacrorum Trias sive  BIBLIOTHECA AN∣GLORUM THEOLOGICA c Lib III  cum Appendice  DE REGIA SOCIETATE LONDINENSI  Labore Stu∣dio  M MARTINI KEMPII c  Regiomont  Pages  THis  English Theological Library  may well recommend itself to the Notice of the  British Librarian  seeing the Author who was Historiographer to the Elector of  Bran∣denburg  has so sincerely intended therein the Honour of the  British  Nation and has commonplaced so succinctly and for the generality so methodically above  sixteen Hundred Writers of Divinity  in  England Scotland  and  Ireland  un∣der some of the most considerable Heads But being writ∣ten in  Latin  and printed abroad at  Koningsberg  in  Prussia  it seems not to have yet made sufficiently its way among some of our Readers to whom it might have been useful in several respects and possibly that among the rest of in∣spiring an Ambition to give us a more enlarged and perfect Plan upon this Subject For strictly speaking tho' such a spiritual Army of all ranks is here muster'd up many who were eminent among us are omitted and several enlisted who little deserve such Distinction some also who were Writers in different Sciences are not very properly perhaps introduced here and of most we have only the bare Names with the shortest Reference to those Parts of their Works which concern the respective Topics under which they are assembled But the Author's Aim was Variety and Dispatch and rather to bring a great number of Writers into a little Compass than either to appear severely scrupu∣lous in his Choice and always distinctly acquainted with their Characters or to make his Readers constantly so with the Editions of their Works The Book will however be very serviceable to any Reader or Writer upon the Subjects herein treated of It will yield Matter of Recollection to those who are even most conversant in our Theological Au∣thors and to those who are most inquisitive after them continual Directions for further Satisfaction The Author neglected no Advantages to render it thus far useful he seems to have consulted our Catalogues very diligently which specify those  English  Authors who have written upon the several Parts of Scripture and other Points of Divinity and further for his purpose to have made good Use of his Time while he was in the Library at  Oxford  among several of the Books themselves which they refer to as also of the Conversation he had with Mr  Boyle  and other learned Men in  England  particularly Dr  Thomas Barlow  afterwards Bi∣shop of  Lincoln  who was himself an  Ecclesiastical Library  As for the Method and Contents more particularly of this Work after the Author's Dedication to the  Elector  afore∣said and a learned Epistle to the Reader he opens it with a copious Preface concerning the different Versions and E∣ditions of the Bible in  England  with notice of those among  us who have written any Discourses thereon or Books to explain it as Annotations Lexicons Criticisms Chrono∣logies Chorographies and the like Then he begins his  first  Book with the  English  Commentators on the  Old Testa∣ment  goes distinctly through all the Parts or  Books  thereof and through all the  Chapters  of every Book and therein tells us what  English  Author has written upon any of the said Books Chapters or Verses in them The like he does in his  second  Book by all the  English  Commentaries Ob∣servations and Sermons on the  New Testament  comprising a Book in every Chapter and the Writers on each Chap∣ter in a Paragraph Thus having got over near half the Volume we come to the last Book which is divided into  Twentyone  Chapters the first  Six  of which comprehend chiefly his  Systema Theologiae Positivae  and the  English  Au∣thors treating of the several Branches therein which for brevity we shall refer to Then we come in the  Seventh  to those  Englishmen  who have written of the  Church  and its Government Ordination Representatives Revenues Po∣lity Schisms Ceremonies Festivals Sabbath Musick and oeconomic State particularly Matrimony Polygamy and Education The th is of the Writers on the four last Things Those who have wrote of Polemical Divinity Against Atheists Jews Turks and Infidels A∣gainst Popery Against the Socinians Anabaptists c Against Enthusiasts Libertines Antinomians and Ar∣minians Against the  English  Sectaries Puritans Se∣paratists Brownists Independents Fanaticks Presbyterians c Against the Quakers On SchoolDivinity On Practical Divinity On Casuistical Divinity Of the improved Editions of the Fathers in  England  Of our PoliticoEcclesiastical Historians And lastly of the  English  Councils  Then follows the  Appendix  containing an epistolary Dis∣course upon the  Royal Society  written in his native Tongue no Author having publish'd in  Germany  any thing upon the Institution Progress and Purpose of that laudable Or∣der With a List of the  Fellows  of the said  Society  and Verses at the end  XII  HISTORIA HISTRIONICA  An Historical Account of the  ENG∣LISH STAGE  shewing the ancient Use Improvement and Perfection of  DRAMATIC  Representations in this Nation In a Dialogue of  PLAYS  and  PLAYERS vo pages  WHen this Pamphlet was publish'd there was a Controversy on foot about the Stage and while others wrote to shew what it then  was  our Author as a Topic not touch'd upon ob∣serves what it  had been  He apologizes to those who may ima∣gine his Subject trivial by producing a Player who was a Saint and referring to Examples of Merit in the Discourse itself  "If the  major  Part of them as he concludes his Preface fall un∣der a different Character it is the general Unhappiness of Mankind that the  most  are the  worst  "  The  Dialogue  is held between  Lovewit  and  Truman  an old  Ca∣valier  who knew the Stage in the Reign of K  Charles  I From these we learn how much the Actors before the Civil Wars sur∣passed their Successors Why they did not now revive  Ben John∣son  's Plays Where before the Wars the Town supported  five  Playhouses at once and in which of them they always acted by Daylight That now the Plays in  two  Houses only would hardly draw an Audience without a Signior  Fideli  or a Monsieur  L'Abbe  That  Edward Allen  built a Playhouse also  Dulwich  College in Then we have a little History of the Actors during the Rebellion shewing how honourably they served in the King's Army Next how they return'd to acting but pri∣vately and in  Oliver  's Time at  HollandHouse  How the Companies reviv'd after the Restoration Where  Scenes  were in∣troduced by Sir  W Davenant  When Women first acted A Character of Mr  Collier  's Book against the Stage That our ancient Plays were of religious Subjects in many Examples from  Stow  Sir  W Dugdale FitzStephens  Lord  Bacon  the Play of the  Pardoner  and  Frene  c When Queen  Elizabeth  first had Players and of Noblemen's Companies The first Comedy that looks like regular Sir  George Buck  's Encomium on acting of Plays in his Time When Theatres were first erected in  London  Of the Prohibition of Plays from  Hollinshed  and Statutes for their Regulation  Eliz  cap and  Jac  cap The two  Ordinances  of the Long Parliament  Octob  and  Feb  the same Year to suppress them That Cockfighting was also prohibited by one of  Oliver  's Acts  March  But the  Old Cavalier  not allowing these as  Laws  takes leave of his Correspondent and so concludes the  Dialogue  The End of  Number I  XIII  The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres Translated out of  Frenshe  by  ANTONE  Erle of  RYVYERS  c Enprynted by  William Caxton  at  Westmestre Folio Leaves  This is a Title gather'd from what the  Translator  mentions in his Preface and the  Printer  in his Conclusion of the Book for the Art of Printing had not yet arrived at the Distinction of  Titlepages  in Form Further we may remark of this antique  Specimen  of that then new Art in  England  that if it is not our first Book printed here it may be the second tho' printed so late in the Year abovemention'd as  November  and tho' some other smaller Work might be printed by  Caxton  the same Year For tho' the Knowledge of two printed before it by him is descended to us yet one is expressly said to be printed abroad and the other has no place mention'd where it was printed Dr  Conyers Middleton  observes  "It has been generally asserted and believ'd that all  Caxton  's Books were printed in the Ab∣bey of  Westminster  yet we have no Assurance of it from him∣self nor any mention of the place before "  Which Ob∣servation is plainly drawn from the Date of this Book and it appears thereby to be the first at least now in being which was printed at  Westminster    "So that he had been printing several Years without telling us where"  See the said Doctor's  Ori∣gin of Printing in England    to Cambr    p  We are in∣form'd there is in being a fair MS of this Translation and what some may think yet a greater Curiosity an Illumination in it representing King  Edward  IV his Queen and the Prince with the Picture also of this  Antony Wydeville  Earl  Rivers  presenting  Caxton  to the King But more particularly of the printed Book we observe it is perform'd on a good thick Paper in which may be discern'd its Maker's Mark to be somewhat like a Pair of Horns with a Flower over them The Pages have no Num∣bers at top nor Signatures or Catchwords at bottom these be∣ing more modern Improvements in Printing at least in  England  The Division of the Chapters is seldom by any larger Space than the other lines only the three first lines of every Chapter being shorter than the rest leave room towards the Margin for the  initial  Letter which is always a small one and the second Let∣ter of the Word which begins every Chapter is always a Capi∣tal As to  Orthography  the same Words are not always spell'd alike and several of the Proper Names are much obscur'd by the old Manner of spelling them especially after the  French  Copy and as to  Pointing  there are but two sorts of Stops used the one a little Dash the other a little Cross and seldom either used as a Period at the End of a complete Sentence it being thought sufficient Distinction to allow a little longer Space there than be∣tween other Words and to begin the next Sentence with a Capi∣tal More Observations might hence be made on the Rudiments of Printing in  England  but to those who are not curious after such Inquiries possibly the greater Number these may be e∣nough Of the noble Earl  Rivers  who translated this Book much might be written therefore we shall only observe here that he publish'd one or more Books after this and refer those who would know more of him to the Chronicles and especially to  Dugdale's Baronage  where it may appear what a Man of su∣perior Merit and Dignity he was among many eminent of his Name also how he was barbarously put to death in  June  at  Pontefract  in  Yorkshire  by the Procurement of  Richard  Duke of  Gloucester  then Protector being aged about Years as we compute from the Account of his Age at the Death of his Mo∣ther  Jacquett  Dutchess of  Bedford  in as it stands upon Re∣cord in the  Escheats    THE first Page of this Book begins with the Earl's Preface or Introduction Herein he observes that every hu∣man Creature is subject to the Storms of Fortune and per∣plex'd  with worldly Adversity of which he had largely had his Part but having been reliev'd by the Goodness of God he was exhorted to dispose his recover'd Life to his Service And understanding there was to be a Jubilee and Pardon at  St James's  in  Spain an  he determin'd upon a Voyage thither so in  July  the same Year set sail from  Southampton  when a worshipful Gentleman in his Company named  Lowys de Bretaylles  lent him to pass over the Time this Book of the  Sayings of the Philosophers  in  French  which had been translated from the  Latin  by Messire  Johan de Teonville  Provost of  Paris  The Earl was very much af∣fected with the wholesome and sweet Sayings therein of the  Paynems  and finding how  "it speaketh universally to the Example Weel and Doctryne of alle Kynges Prynces and to People of every Estate lawdes Vertu and Science blames Vices and Ignorance"  tho' he could not then nor in all that Pilgrimage oversee it well at his Pleasure thro'  the Dispositions that belong to the Taker of a Jubilee and Pardon and the great Acquaintance he found there of wor∣shipful Folks he intended at a more convenient Time to be better acquainted with it Remaining in this Opinion after the King commanded him to attend upon the Prince and having then leisure he translated it into  English  which had not been before done But as there were divers Copies of this Book differing from each other he concludes with intimating his hopes that he shall not be censured for that which he has follow'd or his Translation judg'd of by those which vary from it  The Work itself opens with the Sayings of  Sedechias  so goes on with those of many eminent Ancients as  Homer Solon Hyppocrates Pythagoras Diogenes Socrates Plato Aristotle Alexander Ptolemy Seneca  St  Gregory Galen  and some few others all whom have a Chapter apiece be∣stow'd upon their Sayings But the concluding Chapter comprehends the Sayings of several Persons first of those whose Names are remember'd and lastly such as are  ano∣nymous  from which as the  Apopthegms  of most of those Ancients are now more directly translated from the origi∣nal Languages in which they were deliver'd we shall only give this one Example  "Ther cam byfore a Kyng thre Wysemen the one was a  Greke  the other a  Jewe  and the therde a  Sarasyn  of whom the sayd Kyng desirid that ych of them wold utter som good and notable Sen∣tence Then the  Greke  sayd I may wele correcte and amende my  Thoughtis  but not my  Wordes  Then the  Jewe  sayd I have mervayll of them that  saye  thinges  prejudicial  where  Silence  were more  prouffitable  And the  Sarasyn  sayd I am  Mayster  over my Wordes or it be pronounced but when it is spoken I am  Servaunt  there∣to And it was asked one of them Who might be called a  Kyng  And he answerd He that is not  subgett  to his owne Will  At the end of the Translation of this Work there is a remarkable Chapter added of three Leaves which concludes the whole Volume by  William Caxton  or in his Name For as it contains a Translation from the  French  of those Sarcasms of  Socrates  against the female Sex which our no∣ble Translator of the rest had purposely pass'd over in the proper Place under the Chapter of that Philosopher the Reader is left to judge if the said Earl seriously intended to  favour the Fair by such an Omission in the middle of his Book whether his Printer would probably make so free as to publish it of his own accord tho' in his own Name more conspicuously at the end of it If it is a piece of  Fi∣nesse  it is artfully enough conducted to expose them more notoriously under the Notion of forbearing to do it at all We never read that the Case has been so interpreted nor can say in what Vein or Air Maister  Caxton  's Apology for the said Addition was written or is to be read but there are in it the following Expressions  "I  fynde  that my saide Lord hath left out certayn and dyverce Conclusions towchyng  Women  wherein I mervaylle that my sayd Lord hath not wreton them ne what hath mevyd him so to do ne what cause he hadde at that Tyme But I sup∣pose that some  fayr  Lady hath desired hym to leve it out of his Booke or ellys he was amerous on somme  noble  Lady for whos Love he wold not sette it in his Book or ellys for the very Affectyon Love and good Wylle that he hath unto  alle Ladyes  and Gentylwomen he thought that  Socrates  spared the Sothe and wrote of Women more than Trouthe For if he had made fawte in wryting of Women he ought not ne shold not be belevyd in his other Dyctes and Sayinges But I apperceyve that my sayd Lord knoweth veryly that suche Defautes ben not had ne founden in the Women born and dwellyng in  these Partyes  ne Regyons of the World  Socrates  was a  Greke  boren in a ferre Contre from  hens  whyche Contre is alle of othre Condycions than  this  is and Men and Women of other Nature than they ben here in  this Contre  for I wote wel of what somever condicion Women ben in  Grece  the Women of this  Contre  ben  right good wise playsant humble discrete sobre chast obedient  to their Husbondis  trewe secrete

and other fynde I none sauf that he hath left out these Dictes and Saynges of the Women of  Grece  therefore in accomplishing his Com∣mandement for as moche as I am not in certayn wheder  it was in my

I suppose he never knewe for if he had I dar plainly saye that he wold have  reserved them ines∣peciall  in his said Dictes Alway not presumyng to put and sette them in my sayd Lordes Book but in the  Ende  aparte in the Rehersayll of the Werkis humbly requi∣ryng all them that shal rede this Lytyl Rehersayll that yf they fynde ony Faulte tarrette it to  Socrates  and not to me  c  "  Thus much may suffice of the Apology for the Addition aforesaid which at the same time gives an Ex∣ample of the Language or Manner of Expression in those Times  XIV  Here begynnith the  firste Volum  of Syr  JOHN

Translator's Arms It contains Leaves besides the Translator's Preface and Table of Contents being Chapters The whole toge∣ther being printed on a large black Letter makes a thick Volume in  Folio  The Translator in his  Preface  to the first Volume having spoken much in Commendation of  History  and having a∣mong the rest diligently read the four Volumes of Sir  John Froissart  he judg'd them necessary and proper to be ren∣der'd into  English  since they treat of  the famous Acts done in our Parts  c  and specially redound to the Honour of  Englishmen which Chronicle begins at the Reign of K  Ed∣ward  III and continues to the beginning of K  Henry  IV containing the Space of threescore and fourteen Years that is from to He then bespeaks the favourable Reception of his Labour as to his not following his Author word for word since he trusts that he has kept to the true Sentence or Sense of the Matter and for naming all Per∣sons Countries Cities Towns Rivers or Fields as he found them in  French  And tho' he has not given every Lord Knight or 'Squire his true Addition yet trusts he  has not swerved from the true Sentence of the Matter And where he has named the Distance between Places by Miles and Leagues they must be understood according to the Custom of the Countries where they are named being in some Places longer than in others This is the Sense of his said Preface after which follows  The  Prologue  of Sir  John Froissart  which is the first Chapter Herein we are inform'd That he proposes to take his Foundation out of the true Chronicles compiled by that Right Reverend discreet and sage Master  John le Bel  sometime Canon in St  Lambert  's of  Liege  who with great Diligence Charge and Cost through the Encourage∣ment and Intelligence he received from Sir  John  of  Hay∣nault  continued it all his Days Further That our Au∣thor  Froissart  always inclining to these Studies frequented the Company of divers Noble and Great Lords as well in  France England  and  Scotland  as other Countries and had Knowledge from them of the Adventures that befel espe∣cially since the great Battle of  Poitiers  where King  John  of  France  was taken Prisoner before which time he was but young Yet took upon him as soon as he came from School to write and recite the said Book and bare the same com∣piled into  England  and presented the Volume to  Philippa  of  Haynault  the Queen of  England  who received it to his great Profit and Advancement But because the same Book might not be sufficiently correct he enterprised this Hi∣story on the aforesaid Ordynance and true Foundation at the Instance and Request of a dear Lord of his Sir  Robert  of  Namure  Knight Lord of  Beaufort  And this is the Substance at his  Prologue  Further of this Author Sir JOHN FROISSART and his CHRONICLE we have taken the pains to give our Reader the following more perfect Account chiefly from his own Words than has hitherto been drawn together by any other Writer  He was born at  Valenciennes  as himself tells us Vol II of this Edition fol and in the Year as we gather also from his own Words For he came first over into  England  when  Edward  Prince of  Wales  and his Princess were going to their Government of  Aquitain  Vol II fol b Which by his own Account in the  French  Copies was in but accord∣ing to our  English  Translation Vol II fol the Year fol∣lowing being then aged Years The Interest thro' which he came recommended to the  English  Court and his laudable Undertaking to enlarge and continue  John le Bel  's History chiefly of the  English  Conquests in  France  soon brought him into familiar Conversation with Persons of the greatest Distinc∣tion He was made one of the Clerks of the Chamber to Queen  Philippa  Wife of King  Edward  III as he tells us himself was afterwards knighted and being an Ecclesiastic well be∣neficed in the Church After he had been here about five Years in which Time he had travell'd almost all over  Scotland  and was well known in King  David  's Court Vol II fol b we meet with him at  Burdeaux  when the Prince of  Wales  's Son afterwards King  Richard  II was born there  Anno  He intended to have waited on the Prince in his Expedition to  Spain  but was sent back by him to continue his Attendance on the Queen his Mother Vol II Cap He seems to have staid not above two Years in  England  before he left this Kingdom for a long Time being absent about  Twenty Eight Years  In which space he probably obtained his Ecclesiastical Preferments abroad being Canon and Treasurer of  Chimay  in  Heynault  and of  Lisle  in  Flanders  also Chaplain to  Guy  of  Castellon  Earl of  Blois  as he mentions Vol II fol And Rector of  Le∣scines  on the Mount near  Mons  in  Heynault  according to  Le Laboureur's Introd a L'Hist de Cha  VI p In all this Time he continu'd his  Chronicle  from the Reports of the most credible and intelligent Persons he met with in every Prince's Court to which he remov'd and he seems to have given Copies of the several Parts as he finish'd them to his Patrons for many Quires thereof finely illuminated were in the Custody of  Louis  Duke of  Anjou  in intended by the Author to be sent to the King of  England Le Laboureur Hist de Cha  VI  en la Vie de Louis Duc d' Anjou  But our Author admires none of those Courts so much as that of  Gaston  Earl of  Foix  at  Ortaise  in  Bearn  which was the grandest Market in  Europe  for Tydings or News especially of all Martial Adventures Here he was courteously entertain'd in for twelve Weeks and to that Earl he presented his Collection of  Wenceslaus  of  Bohemia  Duke of  Luxemburgh  's Book called  Meliader  or Songs Ballads Ron∣deaux and Virelays which that Duke had composed Vol II fol He returned not into  England  till King  Richard  was arrived from his Expedition in  Ireland  ib fol and the Peace was concluded for four Years between  England  and  France  ib fol b which was in when he deliver'd Letters of Recommendation to the said King from the Earl of  Heynault  and other Foreign Nobles and was welcom'd by his Majesty  As one who had been and is of the English Court  ib fol b Then he presented the King with a Book fairly illuminated which he had engrossed and bound in Crim∣son Velvet with Silver Buttons and Clasps gilt and golden Roses containing all the Matters of  Amours  and  Moralities  which in Four and Twenty Years before he had compiled ib fol b b One Copy of this Book finish'd two Years before  Pasquier  saw in the Royal Library at  Fontainbleau  as Monsieur  Bayle  has remark'd He continued moving about with the Court sometimes to  Eltham Kingston  hene Windsor  c ib fol And was in this Court more than a Quarter of a Year together and the King received him kindly because he was Clerk and Servant in his Youth to King  Edward  and his Queen And when he departed out of  England  which seems to be the same Year King  Richard  sent him a Goblet of Sil∣ver gilt and in it a Hundred Nobles ib fol We may presume he ended his Life when he left off his Chronicle from his expressing himself upon the Delight he conceived in con∣templating the Merits of his Subject in these Words  "The which excellent Matter as long as I live by the help of God I shall continue for the more I follow and labour it the more it pleaseth me"  Thus much of the  Historian  as to his  Translator  with his other Writings and Actions we refer to them in  Bale Dugdale  's Baronage and  Wood  's  Athen Oxon  Now a Word or two of the  History  and we have done  And first we observe That though the whole  Chronicle  from the beginning of King  Edward  III to King  Henry  IV passes currently under the Name of Sir  John Froissart  yet that there is a fine old MSS of it in  England  beautifully illuminated with Historical Figures particularly of Sir  John Froissart  presenting his Book to the Kings of  England France  c which in the very Title distinguishes the Work to have been begun by  John le Bel  and continued to the Battle of  Poictou  and that then after his Death it was compiled and finished by the Venerable Sir  John Froissart  which is agreeable to what he says in his Pre∣face So that though  Froissart  might here and there correct or augment that first Part as he also intimates yet what he com∣posed begins but at the Year This Observation with that a∣bove from his own Words of his not coming so early into  England  as some have suggested who wou'd from his Authority advance the Order of the Garter up to the Year may clear him from disagreeing with our Authentic Records and antedating the Institution five Years as Mr  Ashmole  has objected the Error if any there is in the said Account being more probably  John le Bel  's and perhaps the Printer's rather than his But here that we are speaking of MSS we must not forget one a∣mong those of  Isaac Vossius  Canon of  Windsor  entitled  L'His toire de Froissart plus ample plus correcte que les Imprimez  Vol Folio From these or others still preserved both in  England  and  France  it has been long and much desir'd that we might have a more accurate Edition in  French  or Translation in  English  than we have yet had 'Tis true the Author him∣self might not be always exact in the naming of so many Per∣sons and Places as he has introduced seeing he received his In∣telligence from such Variety of Informers in such distant Parts and so much from the  Speech  rather than the  Writings  of Men Yet surely his Copies owe little Correction to the Press having undergone the same Corruptions which Books so much treating of  English  Affairs have usually suffer'd by being printed in  France  especially in the  Names  of Families Towns and Lord∣ships And Mr  Selden  has observed in his  Tit  of  Hon  p That the  Numerals  in  Froissart  are also lamentably corrupted and misprinted Yet whoever will have the Patience to com∣pare his Work says Mr  Anstis Ord  of the  Gart  Vol II p with the Coaevous Records publish'd by Mr  Rymer  will from that Essay only be so far satisfied of his Integrity as may induce him passionately to wish for a New Correct Edition And if this Author has not hitherto received the Honour of being printed at the  Louvre  with some other Historians according to the Proposal of the learned Monsieur  du Fresne  in  Le Long Bibl Hist  p upon the National Motive of praising his own Country too little and ours too much see  La Popeliniere Hist des Hist  lib and  Bodin Meth Hist  c These Reasons with the extraordinary Dearness of the printed Copies should excite some learned Person of this Kingdom for the Reputation of our own Country to collate the MS Copies compare the Facts with Records and contemporary Writers and correct the misera∣ble Misspellings in the several Impressions of their Surnames who abundantly signaliz'd their Valour in Justice to the Merits of these celebrated Persons and in Honour to their Posterity The most Ancient of these  Impressions  in  French  seems to be that printed by  Ant Verard  a Bookseller of  Paris Folio  with∣out Date The next was that printed also at  Paris  by three several Persons that is The first Volume by  Fra Regnauld  the second and third by  Michael le Noir  The fourth by  John Petit  The Copy of which Edition now before us bound in Two Tomes Folio has the Arms of many of the Nobility mentioned therein drawn with a Pen in the Margin There was another Impression at  Paris  by  Ant Couteau  also bound in Two Volumes Fol This was that chiefly used by  Denis Sauvage  Historiographer to King  Henry  II of  France  in the Edition he revised and corrected from many Copies and Abridgments which was printed at  Lyons  by  John de Tournes  Fol and again at  Paris  in  Folio  with Marginal Re∣marks and Annotations at the End of every Book He finds fault with the preceding Editors several Parts of whom he may have rightly corrected but is himself liable in many Places to Cor∣rection notwithstanding he has been so preferr'd that a Copy of his Edition has been sometimes sold in  England  for  Ten Guineas  We cou'd wish that most of the Errors in these  French  Editions were as truly corrected in the  English  one as Bishop  Nicholson  imagin'd they were In three of the Editions we have seen neither the Books nor the Chapters are divided alike so that it is very tedious and confusing to find in one of them the References of the other Though  Froissart  's Method is some∣what diffuse and interrupted yet the Epitome we have of him in Print is scarce worth mentioning however drawn up by  Slei∣dan  such a Skeleton he has made of it  o  Franc    c  and with such Partiality to the prejudice of the  English  has he so diminish'd it according to the Censure of our Learned  Humphrey Lhuid in Comment Brit Descrip  fol And yet it has been translated into  English  by  P Golding  and printed in a Quarto Pamphlet But we shall now leave it with our Wishes of better Treatment in the Character and Recommen∣dation of  Montaigne  who in his  Essay upon Books  describing the  Sincere Historian  who has nothing of his own intermix'd but only diligently collects and impartially records all Things without Choice or Prejudice leaving intirely to his Reader's Judgment the distinguishment of Truth says  "Such for Ex∣ample was honest  Froissart  who has proceeded in his Un∣dertaking with so frank a Plainness that having committed an Error he is not ashamed to confess and correct it where∣soever it has been pointed out and who represents to us even the variety of Rumours which were then spread abroad and the different Reports made to him which is the naked and unaffected Matter of History and of which every one may make his Profit according to the Proportion of his Under∣standing"  Then he proceeds to the  Chro∣nicles  divided under the many Chapters beforementioned  of all which though we cannot here precisely give the bare Titles we shall yet point out such Parts as most respecting our own Country may revive the Knowledge of many neg∣lected Particulars which will much illustrate the History thereof  He begins therefore with a short Recital

Leaves vo  Tho' the first Part of these  English Votaries  was  Collected  by our Author  John Bale  in the Year and the Second Part in as appears in his Conclusions of them yet neither of them were  printed  till the Year which was the Year before he was made Bishop of  Ossory  In this Edition was pro∣bably publish'd the Author's  Dedication  to King  Edward  VI however wanting in our Copy which is otherwise a very fair and perfect one because in the Edition printed on a larger Black Letter by  John Tysdale Anno  which was after that King's Death we find such a Dedication of  Bale  's to his said Majesty and also because we see at the End of the Epistle to the Second Part even of the first Edition there is a Wooden Print of our Author presenting his Book to the said King  Edward  In this Dedication we observe that  Bale  design'd to publish Two Parts more of these  English Votaries  or Historical Exam∣ples of the abominable Corruptions among our Bishops Monks Nuns  c  which wou'd have deduced the said Collections down to his own Time For his Words to the King displaying the Scheme of the whole by shewing what these two Parts already publish'd do and what those to be publish'd were to treat of are as follows  "How the great Adversary of God Antichrist hath sens Christes Ascention wrought in his wicked Course to deprave these two Ministrations the Explanation of God's Word and Govern∣ment of the People and to cause them to serve his moste blas∣phemous and filthy Affectes the  First Two Partes  of my  English Votaries  here present doth plentiously shew and my hope is that the  Two Lattre Partes  which will God wil∣ling most spedily follow shal declare it yet much more at large I have therein decreed for difference of the Bookes and apt Arguments of the Matters contained in them to give them Four several Titles of  Rising Building Holding  and  Falling  For the  First  Part treateth of their Uprising to Mis∣chief by th' old Idolaters in the Reign of Perdicion The  Se∣cond  Part sheweth of their hasty Building by the hipocritishe Monks to establish the wicked Kingdom of Antichriste The  Third  Part will declare the crafty upholding of their proud De∣grees and Possessions by the wily and subtil slaightes of the Four Orders of Friers And the  Fourth  Part shall manifest their horrible Fall in this latter Age by the grounded Doctrines of the true Preachers and Writers"    IN his Preface to the first Part our Author says of the  Popish  Clergy That  "Not only have they commaunded unto us Whoremongers Baudes Bribers Idolaters Hy∣procrites Traitors and most filthy  Gomorreans  as Godly Men and Women but also they have canonized them for  most holy Saintes set them up gilt Images in theyr Temples commaunded their Vigils to be fasted

other Parts which were to continue this Work to his own Time but they it seems were never publish'd  What we here have is a diligent Collection from a great Variety of many Foreign as well as our own most ancient Historians both in Print and MSS whom he has particu∣larly cited at the End of every Story or Chapter and also given a general List of them to either Part Some of them are very scarce to be met with in Print or never were prin∣ted and perhaps scarcely now to be recover'd in Manu∣script The Book in the whole may be useful upon many  Occasions tho' to be read with some Grains of Allowance the Zeal of its Author's Mind for the Reformation requi∣ring sometimes itself perhaps to be reform'd for making him a little too violent in his Sentiments and gross in his Language  XVI  A Discourse of  ENGLISH POETRIE  Together with the Au∣thor's Judgment touching the Reformation of our  English  Verse By  WILLIAM WEBBE  Graduate Imprinted at  London  by  John Charlewood Quarto  THE Author of this very scarce Pamphlet consisting of five Sheets and a half  dedicates  it to  Edward Suliard  Esq  whose Sons were under his Tuition and who had been presented by him with some other Work before which was a Translation of some Poetry belike from or into  Latin  In his  Preface  To the  Noble Poets of England  he observes that tho'  Books  of or tending to Poetry were then more numerous than any other  English  Books yet that  "  Poetry  has found fewest Friends to amend it those who can re∣serving their Skill to themselves those who cannot run∣ning headlong upon it thinking to garnish it with their Devises but more corrupting it with fantastical Errors"  Therefore the chief end of his Writing this  Discourse  is to propose a  Reformation  of  English  Poetry  "by having some perfect Platform or  Prosodia  of  versifying  ratified either in Imitation of the  Greeks  and  Latins  or where it would not well abide the touch of their Rules thro' the like Observations selected and establish'd by the natural Af∣fectation of the Speech  But this Project tho' we find it was proposed and attempted by other prime Wits of these Times before such as Sir  Philip Sidney  Sir  Edward Dyer Spenser  Dr  Gabriel Harvey  and o∣thers not succeeding our end of reviving here or reviewing this  Discourse  is chiefly for the sake of those Characters which our Author has given in it of the antient and more especially the  English Poets  from  Chaucer  and  Gower  down to the most considerable of those who flourish'd at the Time of this Publica∣tion that the critical Reader may better know whether the O∣pinions held of them in those Days and ours correspond and better judge from the Conclusions we form upon the Writings of our Ancestors what liberty Posterity will take with our own  "  In the  Discourse  having spoken in general of Poetry what it is whence it had its beginning and in what esteem it has always been according to  Plato Aristotle  and  Spen∣ser  in his  Shepherd's Calendar  which our Author thinks in∣ferior neither to  Theocritus  nor  Virgil  and therefore zea∣lously wishes for his other Works abroad especially his  English Poet  which his Friend  E K  did once promise to publish he then shews the Opinion that was held of the Power of Poetry how  Alexander  and  Scipio  were delighted with it So proceeds to enumerate the most memorable Poets among the Ancients as  Orpheus Amphion Tyrtaeus Homer Ennius  and  Empedocles  with the  Comic Tragic  and  Pastoral  Poets among the  Grecians  and in like manner the  Latin  Poets more particularly of  Virgil  then of the  Epi∣grammatic Elegiac  and  Historical  Poets Of  Ovid Horace  besides many others and also as not inferior to some of them  Palengenius Mantuan  and for a singular Gift in a sweet Heroical Verse matches with them  Christopher Oc∣land  the Author of our  Anglorum Praelia  Hence he descends to the  English  Poets And here ob∣serves that he knows of no memorable Work written by any Poet in  English  till twenty Years past tho' Learning was not generally decay'd at any time especially since  Wil∣liam the Conqueror  as may appear by many famous Works written by Bishops and others yet that Poetry was then in little Account the Light of the old  Greek  and  Latin  Poets which they had being contemn'd by them as appears by their rude versifying wherein they thought nothing to be learnedly written in Verse which fell not out in Rhyme either by the middle Words of each Verse sounding alike with the last or every two Verses ending with the like Let∣ters The Original of which tinkling Verse is ascrib'd by Mr  Ascham  to the  Hunns  and  Goths  King  Henry  I sur∣nam'd  Beauclerk  is here next spoken of his Name being a Proof that Learning in this Country was not little esteem'd of at that rude Time and that among other Studies it is probable such a Prince would not neglect the Faculty of Poetry But the first of our  English  Poets here mention'd is  John Gower  in the Time of King  Richard  II a singular well learned Man whose Works our Author wishes were all  whole and perfect among us as containing much deep Knowledge and Delight  Chaucer  the God of  English  Poets next after if not equal in Time hath left many Works both for Delight and profitable Knowledge far exceeding any other that as yet ever since his Time directed their Studies that way Tho' his Stile may now seem blunt and coarse yet in him may be seen the perfect Shape of a right Poet By his delightsome Vein he so gull'd the Ears of Men with his Devices that tho' Corruption bore such a sway that Learning and Truth could scarce shew themselves yet without Controll might he gird at the Vices and Abuses of all States and gall them with very sharp and eager Inventions which he did so learnedly and pleasantly that none therefore would call him in question  c Lydgate  for good Pro∣portion of his Verse and meetly current Stile as the Time afforded is by our Author thought surely comparable with  Chaucer  yet more occupied in superstitious and odd Mat∣ters than was requisite in so good a Wit which though he handled them commendably yet the Matters themselves be∣ing not so commendable his Esteem has been the less The next of our antient Poets he supposes to be  Pierce Ploughman  who is somewhat harsh and obscure but indeed a very pithy Writer and the first our Author had seen who observ'd the Quantity of our Verse without the Curiosity of Rhyme Then he comes to  Skelton  in the Time of  Henry  VIII who as he obtain'd the LaurelGarland is with good right granted the Title of a Poet being a pleasant conceited Fellow and of a very sharp Wit exceeding bold and would nip to the very quick where he once set hold After him is mention'd Master  George Gaskoyne  as painful a Soldier in the Affairs of his Prince and Country as he was a witty Poet in his Writing in whose farther Commendation he cites the Words of  E K  upon the ninth  Eclogue  of the  new Poet  Here he passes over divers as the old Earl of  Surrey  the Lord  Vaux Norton Bristow Edwards Tusser Churchyard W Hunnis Haiwood Sand Hyll S Y M D  because they would make his Discourse too tedious But observes that the Earl of  Oxford  may challenge to himself the Title of the most excellent among the rest of the Lords and Gentlemen in her Majesty's Court Hence he proceeds to the Trans∣lators among whom he shall ever account Dr  Phaer  the best for his  Virgil  as far as half the tenth Book of the  Ae∣neids  the rest being no less commendably finish'd by that worthy Scholar and famous Physician  T Twyne  Equal with  him he joins  Arthur Golding  for his Labour in  Ovid's Me∣tamorphoses  who for his further profiting this Nation and Speech in all good Learning is here greatly extoll'd The next Place is given to  Barnaby Googe  besides his own Com∣positions for his Translation of  Palengenius his Zodiac  and he is follow'd by  Abraham Flemming  with whom he would join another of his Name who had excell'd as well in all kinds of Learning as in Poetry especially were his Inven∣tions made publick Here he apologizes for not being par∣ticular on the Translators of  Seneca Ovid Horace Man∣tuan  and many others also the Students of the Universi∣ties and Inns of Court because he has not seen all he has heard of nor dwells in a Place where he can easily get knowledge of their Works One however he may not o∣verslip and that is Master  George Whetstone  a Man singu∣larly well skill'd in this Faculty of Poetry To him is join'd  Anthony Munday  an earnest Traveller in this Art in whose Name our Author had seen very excellent Works especially upon Nymphs and Shepherds well worthy to be view'd and to be esteem'd as very rare Poetry With these he places  John Graunge Knyght Wylmot Darrel F C F K  and  G B  But here has reserv'd a Place purposely for one who if not only yet principally deserves the Title of the rightest  English  Poet that ever our Author read that is the Author of the  Shepherd's Kalendar  And finds none fit to couple with him unless  Gabriel Harvey  for his much admir'd  Latin  Poetry his Reformation of our  English  Verse and beautifying the same with brave Devices tho' chiefly hidden in hateful Obscurity and the Author long since occupied in graver Studies And if he were to join  Harvey  's two Bro∣thers the one a Divine the other a Physician is assur'd they would much adorn the Art if they would set their hands to it  After his Judgment of the  Poets  he speaks of the  English Poetry  in its Matter and Form what  Verse  is the Argu∣ments of primitive Poetry the Comic Tragic and Histo∣ric the Use and End of Poetry from the Testimony of  Horace  With his Advice of letting things feign'd for Pleasure nearly resemble Truth how duely observ'd by  Chaucer  Others of  Horace  his Rules with the Translation of Sir  Thomas Elyot  of Reading lascivious Poems and what good Lessons some Readers will pick out of the worst of them Examples to this purpose from  Plautus Terence O∣vid  and  Martial  by Sir  T Elyot  Of Heroic Poetry and  that we have nothing answerable to  Homer  and  Virgil  im∣puted to our not having had a timely regard to the  English  Speech and curious handling of our Verse tho' now it has had great Advantages of Eloquence from some rare and sin∣gular Wits among whom that Master  John Lilly  has de∣served most high Commendations as one who has step'd further therein than any before or since he first began the witty Discourse of his  Euphues  Whose Works surely in re∣spect of his singular Eloquence and brave Composition of apt Words and Sentences let the learned examine and make Trial thereof thro' all the Parts of Rhetoric in fit Phrases in pithy Sentences in gallant Tropes in flowing Speech in plain Sense and surely in my Judgment I think he will yield him that Verdict which  Quintilian  gives of both the best Orators  Demosthenes  and  Tully  That from the one nothing may be taken away to the other nothing may be added But for a closer Example to prove a former Assertion of the Fitness of our Language to receive the best Form of Poetry we are referr'd to the Examination of Dr  Phaer  's Translation of  Virgil  with the Original from both which here are several Examples laid before us and our Critick thinks that the like Inference might be drawn from the Com∣parison of  Ovid  's  Metamorphosis  with  Golding  's Translation  Next our Author treats more particularly of the Pastoral Poetry or Eclogue Here having spoken of  Theocritus Vir∣gil  and others he comes to one of our own Country com∣parable with the best in any Respect even Master  Spenser  Author of the  Shepherd  's  Calendar  who wou'd he thinks have surpassed them if the Coarseness of our Speech that is the Course of Custom which he wou'd not infringe had been no greater Impediment to him than their pure Native Tongues were to them Here we have a little Comparison between  Virgil  's Eclogues and  Spenser  's and the Commen∣dations of  E K  upon the  English  Poet The subject Mat∣ter and use of his said Calendar and our Author's Apology for what had been objected against something in his sixth Eclogue shewing it is the foolish Construction and not his Writing that is blameable To these Writers of Pastorals are join'd those who wrote Precepts of Husbandry in Verse after the manner of  Virgil  's  Georgics  such as that Book  f  Tusser  a Piece surely says he of great Wit and Experience and withal very prettily handled And he thinks that this Argument has been so little treated of in Poetry because so many have written of it in Prose As for a Translation of  the  Georgics  it appears that  Abr Flemming  in his Version of the Eclogues did make some Promise thereof and that our Author  Webbe  did perform the like but it seems not that either of their Works were printed Thence from the Subject of our  English  Writers he passes to the Form and Manner of our  English  Verse censures our barbarous prac∣tice of Rhyming what is understood by Rhyme and how improperly that Word is apply'd The first beginning of Rhyme Rules to be observed in framing our  English  Rhyme Next we come to the several kinds of  English  Verse differing in Number of Syllables where 'tis observ'd the longest Verse in length our Author has seen used in  English  consists of sixteen Syllables not much used and commonly divided each Verse equally into two rhiming alternately The next in length is of fourteen Syllables the most usual of all others among Translators of the  Latin  Poets which also often is divided into two Lines the first of eight Syllables the second of six whereof the sixes always rhime and sometimes the others But to avoid Tediousness and Confusion repeats only the different sorts of Verses in the  Shepherd  's  Calendar  which contains twelve or thirteen several sorts differing in Length or Rhime or Distinc∣tion of the Staves After these Examples we have some Remarks on the natural Order of Words or  Position  in  English  Poetry and that the quantity of our old Verse of fourteen Syllables runs much upon the  Iambic  With further Observations upon Rhime  Gaskoyne  's Instructions for versifying Of some rare Devices and pretty Inventions in Composition as in the Song of  Colin  sung by  Cuddy  in the  Shepherd  's  Calendar  framed upon six Words prettily turn'd and wound up together Not unlike  John Graunge  's Device of making the last Words of a certain Number of Verses fall into Sense And that there were several delicate Performances in this Nature of  Echoes  privately passing a∣mong the finest Poets of our Author's Time We have something also after the manner of the Acrostic from the Compositions of  W Hunnis  Then he proceeds to the re∣formed kind of  English  Verse in Imitation of the  Greeks  and  Latins  which many had attempted to put in Practice and this Part takes up three Leaves in which among other Things he observes the Hexameter to be the most famous Verse and that the first who attempted to practise it in  English  was the Earl of  Surrey  who translated some part of  Virgil  into Verse but without regard of true quantity of  Syllables Here he repeats the famous Distich in  Hexame∣ter  common in the mouths of all Men which was made by Master  Watson  Fellow of St  John  's College in  Cam∣bridge  about forty Years past and two more in the Gloss of  E K  upon the fifth Eclogue of the new Poet That the great Number of the like kind made by Mr  Harvey  were not unknown to any and his own Translation of the two first Eclogues of  Virgil  in the like sort of Verse is by our Author here exhibited After which Examples in  Hexameter  he comes to the  Elegiac  Verse with Examples and lastly in like manner of the  Sapphic  with an Example thereof in his Version from the fourth  Eclogue  in the  Shep∣herd  's  Calendar  of  Colin  's Song sung by  Hobbinol  in praise of the Queen To the whole is annexed The  Canons  or  Ge∣neral Cautions of Poetry  prescribed by  Horace  first gather'd by  Geo Fabricius Cremnicensis  and at the End a short  Epi∣logue  in which for the rendering our Poetry equal with the best in other Tongues he gives us hopes of framing some apt  English Prosodia  but hopes first to enjoy the Benefit of some others Judgment whose Authority may bear greater Credit and whose Learning can better perform it  XVII  Histoire Notable de la  Conversion  des  ANGLOIS  des Saincts du Pays des Monasteres Eglises Abbayes des Pele∣rinages des Apparitions des Esprits des Sainctes

THIS  Notable History of the  Conversion  of the  ENG∣LISH  of the Saints of the Country of Monasteries Churches and Abbeys of Pilgrimages Apparitions of Spirits and holy Reliques comprehended under the miraculous  LIFE  of St  WALBURG  the Virgin Abbess illustrated with copi∣ous Annotations and Historical Discourses by Dr  JOHN L'ESPAGNOL who was  the  Grand Prior  of St Remy of Reims  treating of some Persons who for the Holiness of their Lives and the Magnificence of their Religious Foun∣dations were as Natives of this Island an Honour there∣to in Foreign Parts near a Thousand Years since may on  several Accounts merit the Notice of the  British Libra∣rian  being such a Rarity as to have much escaped the Knowledge or Observation of those who have attempted to enumerate and characterise the Writers of our  Ecclesiastical History  or the  Lives  of our  Saints  The true Searchers after such Antiquities are not to be prejudiced to the rejection of any solid Facts therein by the religious Delusions of those Miracles in which they are sometimes envellop'd and con∣vey'd well knowing that no such ancient Histories from  Popish  Writers wou'd be any ways secure from misleading us if some difference were not to be allow'd and Distinctions practised in Reading them but on the contrary if in such Subjects the  Reader  imitates the  Refiner  he will not spurn at Knowledge because it comes in the  Ore  but separate the  Dross  and embellish the little  Gold  that he finds  After the Author's Dedication To the most Illustrious and Religious Princess  Reneé de Lorraine  Abbess of St  Peter  of  Reims  and his Verses to the most Illustrious and Reverend  Lewis  of  Lorraine  with other Verses in Praise of his Work both in  Latin  and  French  we have the Author's Prayer to St  Walburg  in which we shall forbear to criti∣cise upon his Etymology of her Name  Valburgâ fortè quasi validum burgum  and pass to the Preface from whence we learn that our Author gather'd his Materials for the said  Life  from the Extract which  Surius  has made thereof out of an ancient anonymous MS which our Author thinks might be written either by St  Wilibauld  who did compile an Ac∣count of her Life according to the Testimony of  Molanus  or by  Wolfhard  a Religious  German  who also wrote on the same Subject according to  Surius  and Cardinal  Baronius  He has also collected something from what has been written of her by  George Wicelius  and from a Tract composed by  Philip  Bishop of  Eyst  at the Request of a Queen of  Hungary  and says the  Latin  MSS of the said  Philip  and  Wolfhard  upon this Subject with others were printed at  Ingolstad  in thro' the Care of  Henry Canisius  and that he has been furnished with several other little Fragments and Memoirs from other Historians who are cited in their proper Places After this Preface of two Leaves we have a Summary of the Chapters in this Life and Miracles of St  Walburg  at the End of that is a Table of the Annotations and Discourses deduc'd from and referr'd to in the said Life This is followed with some  Approbations  of the Work by two Foreign and two  English  Doctors at  Reims  whose  Names are  William Gifford  and  Matthew Kellison  And lastly An Extract of the King's Privilege for printing the said Book and securing the Property to the Author  The chief Contents of the Life itself which is comprised in Pages are the holy Expedition of  Winfred  or  Boni∣face  out of  England  into  Germany  to establish the Christian Faith with an Account of those who accompanied him among whom were St  Tecla  St  Lioba  c An Account of St  Richard  King of or in  England  and his two Sons St  Wilibauld  and  Winibauld  their devout Piligrimages Of  Winibauld  's receiving Religious Orders from his Uncle St  Boniface  Archbishop of  Mentz  and also the Government of seven Churches and Monasteries and his Brother being constituted Bishop of  Eyst  with their joint Labours in the Propagation of the Faith How after the Death of the Queen their Mother they sent over for their Sister St  Walburg  Of the Oratory and Monastery her Brother  Winibauld  built near his

aged Years and Burial in her own Monastery Of the removal of her Body by Bishop  Odger  to  Eyst  and her Reliques reposited in a Monastery of  Benedictines  built for that Purpose Of many Cures performed upon the re∣moval of her Reliques with a Prayer to God and St  Wal∣burg  by the Author Of the Churches built by the Earls of  Flanders Kenemberg  and  MountBeliard  in Honour of her Reliques How renowned she was also in  France  in the Diocese of  Reims  chiefly in the Village call'd after her own Name near  Attigny  because some part of her Body was brought thither by  Charles  the  Bald  Emperor of  Germany  and King of  France  who founded a Church in Honour of her which being afterwards demolish'd by the  Norman  In∣fidels that Chapel was built which stands says our Author at present in its Place  The rest of the Book to the End consists of  Annota∣tions  or distinct Discourses occasionally enlarging upon se∣veral Parts of the Life in  ThirtyFour  Chapters Among which the

and Honour to our own Country  XVIII  The Maintenance of  Free Trade  according to the  Three  Essential Parts of Traffique namely  Commodities Mo∣neys  and  Exchange  of Moneys by Bills of Exchanges for other Countries  c By GERARD MALYNES Mer∣chant vo  Pages    THIS little Work was written in Answer to a Treatise newly published entitled  Free Trade or the Means to make Trade flourish  wherein its Author had omitted to han∣dle the predominant part namely the Mystery of  Exchange  between us and other Nations his only Scope being to have the Moneys of the Kingdom enhanced in Price and the Fo∣reign Coins inconveniently made current in the Realm at high Rates And because the said Treatise was publish'd at the Time when King  James  had referr'd the consideration of this important Business to  Henry  Viscount  Mandeville  Lord President of the Privy Council with others of Know∣ledge and Experience among whom our present Author Mr  Malynes  was call'd and did certify his Opinion he therefore dedicates this  Answer  to his Majesty  In his said Dedication he lays down  Traffic  to be the  Preheminent Study of Princes  because the Sacred Wisdom has approved this  Axiom  "That a  King  is miserable how  rich  soever he be if he reigns over a  poor  People and that a  Kingdom  is not able to subsist how rich soever the  People  be if the  King  be not able to maintain his Estate"  He concludes with observing that  Worthy  of Commenda∣tion are those who can by Providence  preserve  the Trea∣sure of Kings and Commonwealths  worthier  are those who both by honest and lawful Means can  preserve  and  augment  them but  worthiest  of all Immortal Praise are those who can and do by easy just and politic Means  inrich  Kingdoms and Commonwealths and thereby fill the Prince's Coffers with standing Treasure to serve in Time of War when Arms are necessary and the Time of Peace more fitting wholesome Laws  "In the  Theorick  Part of which Study I have says he these forty Years spent much Time and Charges at the Pleasure of Great Per∣sonages  And albeit nothing did encounter me but In∣gratitude yet my Constancy to spend the Remainder of my Days therein in hope of  Practice  is as immoveable as the Continuance of my daily Prayers  c  to multiply your Majesty's Days as the Days of Heaven"  The knowing and ingenious Author of this scarce and cu∣rious Tract who thus spent Forty Years in the Study of Means to enrich his Country by Traffic was a Person of such conside∣rable Note for his Abilities that he was often called to the Coun∣cil Table both in Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign and King  James  's for his Opinion in  Mercantile  Affairs He was appointed one of the  Commissioners of Trade  in the  Low Countries  for settling the Value of Monies about the Year He was afterwards a Commissioner also at Home in the Year for establishing the true  Par of Exchange  and upon the Laws enacted in the fourth Year of King  James  for the making of good and true Cloth he exhibited a  Demonstration  to the Lords of the Privy Council shewing the  Weight Length  and  Bredth  of all sorts of  Cloths  and that  Weight  and  Measure  do controul each other whereby the Merchant who buys the Cloth may be enabled to find out the Fraud and Deceit of the Clothier We find also that he publish'd several other Books besides this above abstracted as near Thirty Years before it  The Canker of England's Com∣monwealth  also  England's View  and that he now had under the Press a Volume entitled  Lex Mercatoria  or  The Ancient Law Merchant  wherein the dangerous Rocks to be avoided in the Course of Traffic and the Means thereunto con∣ducing are manifested for the Preservation and Augmentation of the Wealth of these Kingdoms according to  Jus Gentium  the Knowledge whereof is of such Moment that all other Tem∣poral Laws without it are not complete He writ also  The Royal Merchant of Great Britain  which he had now in MS and perhaps others which we have not leisure at present to en∣quire after  In his preliminiary Discourse he distinguishes the  Three  Essential Parts of Traffic namely  Commodities Money  and  Exchange  to be the  First  as the  Body  which upheld the World by Commutation and Bartering till Money was de∣vised the  Second  as the  Soul  in the Body infusing Life to Traffic by the Means of Equality and Equity the  Third  as the  Spirit  and  Faculty  of the  Soul  being seated every where corroborating the vital Spirit of Traffic and di∣recting or controlling by just Proportions the Prices and Values of Commodites and Moneys A little further he  tells an Ingenious Tale which he applies to the Force of Exchange by inferring That the Author of the  Treatise of Free Trade  is like the Novices mention'd in that Tale who perceiving two great Whales to have assaulted the  English Ship of Traffic  the one being the  Wars  in  Christendome  and the Pirates and the other more gentle being the  Policy  of Princes and States hath publish'd the  Causes  of the  Decay of Trade  in  England  and the Means to make the same flou∣rish without observing the operative Power of  Exchange  which is the  Rudder  of the  Ship of Traffic  fastned to the  Rule  of the  Equality  of  Moneys  according to their Weight and Fineness  The Treatise itself containing many observable Particu∣lars is divided into five Chapters the  First  whereof is on  The Causes of the want of Moneys in England  This Chap∣ter begins with some Remarks on the Undervaluation of Money in Exchange with an Instance of the Value of  Realls  and the  Par of Exchange  when  Dudley  Earl of  Lei∣cester  went Governour of the Low Countries in Whence it is concluded That if the Low Exchange were not the Gain wou'd prove to be imaginary that when the Exchange answers the true Value of our Moneys they are never exported because the  Gain  is answered by Exchange which is the Cause of Transportation so that Exchange is still predominant and strikes the stroke and tho' the Price rises and falls according to the plenty or scarcity of Money yet Moneys are overruled thereby for if you enhance the Coin the Exchange controlls it and rises accordingly if you un∣dervalue it the Exchange in like manner falls to the end that the Value thereof shou'd be answer'd by the public Mea∣sure and to prevent all Abuses in the Price of Commodities and Valuation of Moneys either Real or Imaginary according to the Custom of the Place by device of the Bankers That this was seriously observed in by the Lord Keeper  Bacon  Lord Treasurer  Burghley  Secretary  Walsingham  with other Counsellors of State besides many Persons of Experience as Sir  Thomas Gresham Richard Martin  Ma∣ster of the Mint and many more here named who found that the Bankers or Exchangers for their private Gain had brought in Twenty Inconveniencies which are here parti∣culariz'd By which it may be seen says our Author of what Importance the Operation of Exchange is and where∣in the Endeavours of Sir  Thomas Gresham  thinking to rule the Exchange of  England  by plenty of Money prov'd fruit∣less  which might have been performed with more facility by Direction Here we have Foreign Examples from  Bo∣din  of Bankers having their Goods confiscated and being indicted as Cozeners seeing that in a short time with Pounds they had gotten This is apply'd to the Kingdom of  England  and in what Case it wou'd have been more sensible of the like Loss since tho' Queen  Elizabeth  's Coffers were stored with seven hundred thou∣sand Pounds Sterling before the Wars with the Earl of  Ty∣rone  in  Ireland  more than double that Sum had been spent therein  The Second Cause of our Want of Money  is next imputed to the superfluity of  Plate  in private Hands Under this Head is observed the great Quantity of Silver con∣sumed in Silver Thread Spangles  c  upon late Examina∣tion found to amount to above fourscore thousands Pounds yearly whereas the Plate made in  London  is only fifty or sixty thousand Pounds worth Here we have the several Opinions given to  Charles  IX of  France  upon his want of Money after the  Parisian  Massacre some under colour of suppressing Pride advising him to prescribe every Man what store he shou'd keep and melt down the rest Others that he wou'd imbase his Money under the Standard of Plate so bring Plate to be turn'd into Money This is follow'd by another Example in our  Henry  VIII who priviledg'd his Nobles to make base Money of their own Plate which fell  ut to the prejudice of the Commonwealth and was but a shift for the Time to himself Then we have a more par∣ticular Account of Gold and Silver Thread both as to what the Author had recommended in his  England  's  View  about making it at home and the Reasons why by late Procla∣mation the Foreign Manufacture thereof was encouraged  The Third Cause of our want of Money  is ascrib'd to the Con∣sumption of Foreign Commodities or the buying them pro∣portionably dearer than we sell our own which he has proved in his  Canker  of  England  to proceed from the A∣buse of Exchange Here we have the Causes of the over∣ballancing of Commodities and the Effects by which the  English  Merchants are bereaved of two essential Parts of Trade in three And here we see the Advantages which Foreign Trade has over ours and how our Commodities are fallen in Price that  French  Wines are dearer to us by the Money of the Realm's being undervalued in Ex∣change and that the less Sterling Money we reckon in Ex∣change with them the more is the gain of our Commodities  The Fourth Cause is the Want of Money  according to the  Treatise  our Author answers for these Causes he takes from thence is the great Want of our  EastIndia  Stock at home but our Author expected the ready Money sent in  Reals  of Plate to be imploy'd in the said Trade wou'd rather have been mention'd not but he thinks this  EastIndia  Trade which began with us in  England  immediately after the great Jubilee Year might be very profitable hereafter He gives us an Instance in  Pepper  which if it cost but Twopence halfpenny the Pound in the  Indies  and Ten Shillings employ'd therein will require but Shillings for all Charges to deliver it in  London  where it is usually sold for above Twentypence it follows there must be great Gain which will encrease when the Parties shall be united in true Love Whereas the Loss we suffer by the undervaluing of our Mo∣ney in Exchange yearly is greater than all the Moneys em∣ploy'd yearly for the  EastIndies  wherefore he is for encou∣raging this Trade and the rather for that the  Hollanders  found Reasons which are here produced for continuing the same Here we have also some Observations upon our Riches since the Discovery of the  WestIndies The Fifth Cause of our Want of Money  imputed to the Wars of  Chris∣tendom  causing Exportation and the  Pirates  hindring Impor∣tation of Money is next examin'd Here our Author argues that if the  Pirates  did not take some of our Money it fol∣lows not that the same wou'd come to us in  Specie  and a  to the Exportation by Wars he answers to the Argument that the  RixDollar  being raised in many Places of  Germany  shou'd draw abundance of Money into the Mints of those Countries that Money inhanced is never carried to the Mint but runs away like Posthorses every Man fearing to lose by the Fall We have here several other Remarks upon these  Dollar  and the Alterations of their Value from the Year and the Chapter is concluded with Advice to note the Valuation of  Hamborough  where it has been at fif∣tyfour  Stivers  the Dollar which makes the Exchange above forty Shillings of their Money for Twenty of ours  "And tho' we have raised the Price of Exchange from Twentyfour Shillings Ninepence to about Thirtyfive Shillings shall we rest here and go no further And shall we be like Men that halting in Jest become Lame in Earnest"  Chap II  Shews the Causes of the Decay of Trade in the Merchandize of England  by an Examination also of several Heads in the manner aforesaid as First  The Want of Money  Secondly  Extortionate Usury  Thirdly  Litigious LawSuits  Fourthly  Free Fishery of Foreigners in his Majesty's Seas  with the Reasons of our own Merchants in favour of that Liberty as if  England  cou'd not maintain a  Sea  and  Land Trade  together also several  Examples  how other Princes neglect not the Advantage to be made of their Seas but both encourage their own Subjects to fish in them and make other Nations pay Duty for the like Which have long determin'd the question of  Mare Liberum  allowing the  Freedom of the Seas  for  Navigation  where it does not prejudice the distinct  Dominion  of Princes concerning their  Fishery  Fifthly  The Abuses of our Drapery  Here we have a particular that the dressing and dying of them were insi∣sted on to be done in  England  in and that then Thousand Cloths were exported with a Digression of our Author's upon the envious Interpretation of his Studies for the welfare of the Kingdom particularly in his Invention of  Farthing  Tokens which are yet found most commodious to prevent the waste of Silver and relieve the Poor Sixth∣ly  The Policies of Merchants in monopolizing the Exportation of Cloths  Seventhly  The false making of our Cloth  And here we have the Inconveniences of engrossing in Trade further laid open Eighthly  The Exportation of the Mate∣rials of Wool  and the  Customs  or  Impositions  laid upon Cloths at Home and Abroad Ninthly  The Wars in Christendom and Pirates  occasioning the fall of Wool from to Shillings the Tod and the inconsiderate  Barter  of it Abroad Tenthly  The immoderate Use of Foreign Commodities  which concludes this Chapter  Chap III  Of Governed Trade and therein of Monopoly  Here we have some further curious Observations upon the  Exchange  of Money and among others the Proverbial Cha∣racter in  Bodin  of a Man of Experience and distinguishing Head when they say  Il entend le Par  also a  Syllogism  up∣on the Undervaluation of our Money and a Comparison of  Exchange  to the  Assay  of Money Commendations of Ma∣ster  Hussey  Governor of the MerchantAdventurers in the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign for the great Pains he took in settling the  Parity  of Exchanges however the true Remedy to rule the Course of them was but lately found out The Opinions of mercantile Men upon the  best Methods  of Traffic with our Author's Discussions thereup∣on as  Whether Foreign Nations shou'd come and fetch our Wares And whether there shou'd be no Societies or Corpora∣tions  of Merchants  Which tho' our Author is for allowing under Government in appointed Places because they may by such Order be remov'd or recall'd and for that no Nation trafficks so much in the bulk of staple Commodities insomuch that two Years before the taking of  Antwerp  all the Wares in  Christendom  vented there in one Year being valued the  English  amounted to four Parts in six Yet we must not flatter Companies or Societies says he in their unadvised or irregular Proceedings for a Society may be∣come a Monopoly when some few Merchants have the whole managing of a Trade to the hurt of a Commonwealth and when many others might also negotiate for the common good Here we have a Definition of a  Monopoly  and an Approbation of the Custom in the City of  Noremberg  where they receive all the Manufactures of the People and paying these weekly sell those for a reasonable Profit This is fol∣lowed with some Observations on the Royal Commodity of  Tin  which above Years past was sold for Shil∣lings the Hundred when the best  Velvets  were sold for Shillings the Yard Also of the Abolition and Reestablish∣ment of  Praeemption  whereby the Wealth of the Kingdom has been since encreased Thousand Pounds  Sterling  and his Majesty received for his Benefit Thousand Pounds Also how the Importation of  Spanish Tobacco  gains the Kingdom many Thousand Pounds yearly Next we have his Opinion upon  Joint Stocks  in Companies and last∣ly the general Intention of all Grants by  Letters Patent  for New Inventions with Reflections upon those especial∣ly relating to  Alloms  rendering the Commodity dearer to the Subject and cheaper to the Transporter or Stranger which he resembles to the Silver Mines of the Duke of  Brunswick  maintained at his own Charge called the  Wild∣man  which cause him to coin Dollars having his Arms on one side and a Savage Man on the other holding a burning Candle in his Hand with this Inscripton  Aliis inserviendo consumor  Chap IV  Of want of Government in Trade  And herein he sets down the Errors in Trade committed by Merchants relating to Cloths and the making over their Moneys beyond Seas Then he proceeds First To enu∣merate the  Defective Means and Remedies  no less than Thirtyfive which have been tried these Years and next to shew wherein they have been found fruitless and that the decrease of Wealth in a Kingdom may be compre∣hended  under these Heads The selling our Native Com∣modities too cheap buying Foreign Wares too dear and exporting our Money in Specie or exchanging it for Money by Bills and how the Undervaluation thereof causes it to be exported or hinders the Importation This leads us in the last Place to  Chap V  Of the Remedies for all former Causes of the Decay of Trade  Here he begins with his Remedies First For the  undervaluing  our Money by  overvaluing  Foreign Coin and these are by the Reformations of  Exchange  here proposed in causing the Value of our Money to be given in Exchange which wou'd out off the Gain had by the Exporta∣tion of it and make Foreign Coin not to be received above Value More particularly how this recovery of  England  's Wealth is to be effected by Proclamation and by publick Tables fixed up at the  Royal Exchange  like those kept at  Dover  in the Time of King  Edward  III to receive the Passenger's Money and by Exchange in Specie for it be∣yond Seas which made them leave their Moneys in the Realm Further also by taking warning from the Incon∣veniencies of inhancing Moneys in several Examples of King  Henry  VI who raised the Ounce of Sterling Silver from to Pence and King  Edward  IV from to Pence And King  Henry  VIII his raising the  Angel No∣ble  from Shillings and Pence to Shillings and Pence and afterwards to Shillings and Pence whereby every Ounce of  Sterling  Silver was worth Pence yet there was nothing effected thereby the Money still altering beyond Sea Wherefore  Wolsey  had power given to alter the Valuation from time to time as he saw cause Soon after it is shewn how the  Turks Persians  and  Russians  are by keeping the Price of their Exchanges above the Valuation of their Mo∣neys more politick than we Hence the Question is re∣solv'd whether it is more expedient to raise the Price of Exchange or the Valuation of Money Next he shews how the want of Money has sunk the Price of  Plate  from Shil∣lings and Pence to and Pence and what wou'd be the Conseqence of its rising Here he recommends all wrought Plate to be try'd and mark'd also all Silver Thread from abroad and that they shou'd receive our Wool in Ex∣change for it The Consumption of Foreign Commodities or overballancing of them is referr'd to the Considerations upon the Abuse of Exchange before And the excessive Use of  Tobacco  to the Limitation of  Spanish Tobacco  lately esta∣blish'd  that the Plantations of  Virginia  and  Bermudas  may be advanced thereby The want of Money thro' the  Wars  and  Piracies  is compris'd in the Reformation of  Exchange  and the Policy of  Rewards  Thus having to the Causes of the want of Money join'd some Means for supplying it he comes to the Remedys also for the Decay of Trade And here  Secondly  Under the Head of  Usury  to be remedied by Money procur'd as afore directed he recommends the Custom of setting over  Bills  of  Debt  from one Man to ano∣ther and a Stock to erect  PawnHouses  and for principal Towns to take in Money upon the Adventure of their own or other Men's Lives as at  Venice  where a Man for three or four Hundred Pounds shall be sure of one Hundred Pounds a Year for Life The  Third  Cause of Decay in Trade ascri∣bed to litigious LawSuits our Author thinks there can be no shorter Course to remedy than is us'd upon Proof and Specialities if the Pleadings and Issues be join'd according to the first Institution whereby the  Matter of Fact  may ap∣pear before a Jury For touching the  Matter of Law  it being separated makes a  Demurrer  to be determin'd by the Judge Here he commends the Course in  Germany  to take down litigious Humours where a Fine of Twelvepence in the Pound or more is paid to the Emperor or Magistrates for so much as is claim'd of the Defendant more than can be proved to be due besides further Charge if he be found to proceed upon Revenge As for the Differences between Merchants he refers to his  Lex Mercatoria  as also the  Fourth  Remedy in behalf of the Fishing Trade The  Fifth  upon making Cloth abroad is partly redress'd by the late Proclamation to prohibit Exportations of that kind And the Rules of our Author for the true making of Cloth may be a Remedy for the  Seventh  Cause of Decay as also to the  Eighth  but the  Sixth  concerning the  Policy of Merchants  is recommended for the general and not particular Good to the Inspection of a Committee so that other Merchants may upon reasonable Considerations be admitted of the said Companies The  Ninth  Cause is partly handled in the  First  and as to  Bankrupts  some Remedy is assign'd also before in setting over Bills of Debt and the Defects in the Statute against them is to be remedied by the Authority of  Chan∣cery  to the Commissioners appointed to examine the same The Remedy to the  Tenth  and last Cause of our said De∣cay the Immoderate Use of Foreign Commodities con∣sists as was observed before partly in reforming the Abuse  of Exchange whereby such Abundance is imported and partly in restraining the Affectation of the Vulgar to imi∣tate their Superiors by their being deprived of their Ill Examples Our Author concludes That all these Causes of the Decay of Trade in  England  are mostly comprised in that One the  Want of Money  whereof the  Abuse of Ex∣change  is the  Efficient  Cause which made him project so easy  a Remedy  whereby the Kingdom shall enjoy the  Three Essential Parts  of Traffic under Good and Politic Govern∣ment which will effectually produce a  Free Trade  XIX  HONOUR'S GENEALOGIE  or The  Arms  of the Ancient and Late  KINGS  of  ENGLAND  and  GREAT BRITAIN  with their different  Supporters  and  Badges  of Regalitie With the several  Degrees  of all the  NOBILITIE  of this  NATION  at and since the Conquest  Saxons  and  Nor∣mans  viz The Dukes Marquesses Earls Viscounts and Barons by Fee Writs of Summons and Patent their Creation Succession Matches Issue and Arms With some Observations of their several Places of Honour and Trust and what else is remarkable in any of them  By JOHN TILESON  Esq  Anno  MS  Folio Pages    This spacious and beautiful MS bound in  Blue Turkey  Leather with the Leaves gilt Writing very fair and Arms of our Kings with near  seven hundred  of our  Nobility  from the Con∣quest all blazon'd in their proper Colours is to be seen among the MS Collections in the Hands of Mr  Thomas Osborne  for whom this  British Librarian  is printed The Author's Name was first written  Tilson  but by Correction as it is above We find that his particular Friend or Patron was  John  Lord  Byron  whose singular Favours to him  has  says he  fol    for ever oblig'd me to himself and Family  Tho' he mentions none of the Nobility created later than the Year and the Date in the TitlePage of the Volume is but two Years later we observe by his mentioning the Death of  Francis  Lord  Cottington fol  That he must have writ the Conclusion of this Book at least so late as the Year If some few Mistakes have escaped in the Blazonry or in the Historical Account of the Alliances and Issue they are not greater perhaps than what might be rea∣sonably expected in any other Heraldical Work where such Distinctions are undertaken especially in such Extent of Time and consequently such Variety of Families    ABOUT the Margins of this  TitlePage  we have the Arms of Twenty of our Kings  before  the  Conquest  painted in their proper Colours that is from  Egbert  down to  Harold  who lost the Kingdom to  William  the  Norman  And the  Preface  is  A Discourse concerning the Nobility of England according to the Laws of England  The begin∣ning whereof for a Taste of the Author we shall here give in his own Words  "As in the Body natural for the Pre∣servation of the whole the different Temperature of Hu∣mours and Offices in several Members are requisite So likewise in the Body Civil or Politic different Estates and Degrees among Men have been judged as necessary And as the Elements cannot be intermingled one with another except it be by an unequal Proportion and Temperature So Civil Societies cannot possibly be preserved but by a certain Inequality which is apparent by the different Forms of Government observed and establish'd in all Countries And the ancient Policy of this Realm of  England  being govern'd by  Royalty  ever since it was known to be an in∣habited Piece of Earth hath admitted of a Threefold Divi∣sion of Persons  viz King Nobles  and  Commons  which hath been a Government very Ancient and fully under∣stood both by Magistrates and People and rooted in Mens Affections both by long habituated Excercise and the well approved Benefits received thereby"  After this he proceeds to distinguish the several Degrees or Titles of Honour and first of the  King  and his Sove∣reign Power That many of his Rights are termed  Flowers of the Crown  in which respect  Bracton  speaking of them says The King's  material  Crown is adorned with  Flowers  Also that some of his Rights are by positive or written  Laws  others by right of  Custom  And that the  Regalia  or Ensigns of Royalty especially the  Crown Scepter Purple Robe  and  Golden Ball  are as old among us as King  Ar∣thur  according to the Testimony of  Leland  Next he shews That the  Nobility  comprehend the  Prince Dukes Marquesses Earls Viscounts  and  Barons  as the  Commons  consist of  Knights Esquires Gentlemen Yeomen Artificers  and  Labourers  Which last are not here further spoken of  this Work confining itself to the superior  Nobility  There∣fore having given us the Derivation of  Nobilitas  from the Word  Nosco  as one known or  notable  for his Vertue or the reward of it he distinguishes why they are called Peers and the whole Body of them the Baronage what difference there is in their Parliament Robes how they are tryed by the whole Body and in what Cases they retain both their  Christian  and  Surnames  then descends more particularly to their several Degrees Here we see That the Title of  Prince  was called by the  Saxons Aetheling  That the  Nor∣mans  only call'd him the  King's Son  and the  first begotten  of the King of  England  till King  Edward  I summoned his Son  Edward  to Parliament by the Title of  Prince  of  Wales  and Earl of  Chester  and  Edward  III created his Son Duke of  Cornwall  since which this Title has been appropriated to the King's first Son That as for the Title of  Duke  it was first of  Charge  and  Office  not of  Dignity  after the A∣bolition of the  Roman  Government here and that this De∣gree in the Days of  Constantine  was inferior to that of  Co∣mites  moreover upon what Conditions this Title of Duke was conferr'd as also that of Earl or what Qualifications were requir'd in them namely Faithfulness and Valour ap∣proved with the Protection of Widows and Orphans that People under their Regiment might with Joy continue in Peace That the Title began under  Otho  but in  England  not before King  Edward  III created his Son  Edward  aforesaid and also his two other Sons from which time we have had Hereditary Dukes That the  Marquess  was not known to us till King  Richard  II made his Minion  Robert Vere  Earl of  Oxford  Marquess of  Dublin  and became not till then a Title of Honour for before those who govern'd the  Marches  were commonly called Lord  Marcheres  The Title of  Earl  some think to be derived from the  Germans  who had their  Comites  according to  Tacitus  but others think it came from the  Romans  and that before  Constantine  the  Great  the Name of  Comes  was not used as a Title of Honour That after the dissolution of the  Roman  Empire this Title of Earls was retained by our  English Saxons  and the  Danes  termed them by a Word signifying Honourable which somewhat mollified agrees with what we at present call them That they became not before the  Normans  got footing here Feudal Hereditary and Patrimonial as ap∣pears by  DomesdayBook  After that they were created with the Additional Name of a  Place  and Assignment of the  Third Penny  of the Shire as appears by the Empress  Maud's  Creation the most ancient Form which has been seen of  Geoffrey Mandevill Earl  of  Essex  And King  John  was the first we meet with who used the Cincture of a Sword in their Creation and they waited at his Table there with it by their Side It was the next Age before the Imposition of a Chaplet Cap of Honour with a Circlet of Gold came up which after that as at this Day was turn'd into a Coro∣net with Rays or Points The  Earls Palatine  were rec∣kon'd most Honourable and  Hugh Lupus  held the Earldom of  Chester  as freely by the Sword as the King held  England  by the Crown To which was added the distinction of bearing the Sword at Coronations called  Curtana  which being blunt betokened Mercy This Earl ordained Barons and Abbots to serve in his Parliament who with him made Laws for the Government of his County Earldoms of Title without Place as the  Earl Marshal  of  England  be∣gan under King  Richard  II who gave that Title to  Thomas Mowbray  Earl of  Nottingham  As for  Viscounts  it is also an old Name of Office but a new one of Dignity not be∣ing known among us for a Title of Honour before King  Henry  VI who created  John  Lord  Beaumont Viscount Beaumont  Here 'tis remarked That after a Man is cre∣ated an Earl or Viscount or any other Title of Honour a∣bove them his Title becomes parcel of his Name and not an Addition only and in all Legal Proceedings he must be stiled by that Dignity  Lastly  We come to the  Barons  And here 'tis observed that our ancient  Britons  did not ac∣knowledge the Name and that in the  English Saxon  Laws it is not seen That in the  Saxon  Glossary of  Alfricus  a∣mong the Vocables or Terms of Honour  Dominus  is trans∣lated  Laford  which we have contracted into  Lord  and the  Danes  called their Free Lords who equall'd the Barons of our Time  Thani  And that in a Fragment of the Laws of  Canute  was the first mention of a  Baron  with us yet there∣in according to the Varieties of Copies is indifferently read  Virones Barones  and  Thani  The Service of these Barons appears from the Laws of  William  the Conqueror into which those Ordinances of  Canute  are translated in the  Norman  Tongue where it being ordain'd That the  Heriot  or  Relevies  should be moderate and those of an  Earl  men∣tion'd it appears that some of those Accoutrements for the Wars to be raised by the  Barons  were but half in propor∣tion as four Horses two Swords four Spears and four  Targets but for the rest only one Helmet one Coat of Mail and in Money only  Mances  or  Marks  of Gold which are but a fourth Part Also after the coming of the  Normans Valvasors  and  Thanes  were ranged in Degree next after  Barons  and our learned Interpreters have thought the Dignity of  Barons  was comprehended un∣der the  Valvasores Majores  afterward called  Capitanii  and that the like Dignity was by the  English Saxons  before the Conquest called  Thanes  according to  Lambert  in his  Per∣ambulation  of  Kent  Neither was the Name of  Baron  then granted to be of great Honour some  Earls  having in those Days their  Barons  under them of which here are Examples produced A few Years after they were accounted  Barons  who held an entire  Barony  consisting of  Knights Fees  and one Third which amounted to Marks yearly A  Knight's Fee  consisting of  Carves  of Land a  Carve  of  Oxgangs  an  Oxgang  of Acres These  Baronies  were held some of the King and those who had them of this Value were taken for  Barons  by Fee to which was annexed a Dignity with Jurisdiction which the  Court Barons  in some sort prove In King  Henry  IIId's days there were reckon'd in  England    Baronies  But this Dignity attained to its highest Honour after that King in the th Year of his Reign summon'd a select Number to the Parliament and they of the most ancient Families and excellent Qualifica∣tions and decreed that none other shou'd come which his Son  Edward  I also constantly observ'd Hence they were only accounted  Barons  whom the King by such Writs of Sum∣mons did call to Parliament And 'tis observ'd to the great Glory of this King  Edward  that he did always direct his said Writs to those of the best Families and whose Wisdom and Virtues were answerable But pass'd over their Sons af∣ter their Death if they were not equal to their Parents in Understanding and all other commendable Qualities Here we have some curious Questions debated upon this Head as  Whether a Barony by Writ may descend from the An∣cestor to the Heir Whether it may descend to the Heir Fe∣male who is nearer akin than the Males And whether if it may descend to such Females their Husbands may assume the Style and Dignity of such a Barony  Herein are Argu∣ments produced on both sides of these Questions after which follow others to compound the Controversy by our Author So from the Nature Quality and State of  Barons  by  Writ  he passes to  Barons  by  Creation  begun by King  Richard  II And for the Explanation of this Dignity here also are some Questions resolved Then he proceeds to discourse of  Barons  by  Tenure  or such as held any Ho∣nour Castle or Manor as the Head of their Barony by Barony or Grand Serjeanty That they were  Spiritual  and  Temporal  the former of whom having lost their Seat in Parliament  Car  he says nothing more of them but of the Temporal  Barons  by  Tenure  having shewn that such there were he lays down some Arguments and Examples to determine the Question  Whether after alienating the Lands by which they hold they can retain their Title and Dignity  Thus having touch'd upon the Original Nature and diffe∣rent Degrees of our  Peerage  he concludes with some Ob∣servations upon their  Privileges  this his Preface consist∣ing of Twentysix Pages  The Work begins with a Display in one Leaf of the  Arms  of our Kingdom under its different Governments in five several  Scutcheons  representing in their proper Co∣lours those of the  Saxons Romans Britons Danes  and the  Normans  in the middle So we turn over and begin with the Nobility under  William  the  Conqueror  and first with  Edgar Etheling  who was  Earl  of  Oxford  before and at the coming of the said  William  into  England  A short Account being given of this Earl and his Arms painted on the side of it we have two other contemporary Nobles treated of after the like Manner in the same Page and this regular Method of Historizing three Noblemen in every Page with the  Blazonry  of their Arms in the Mar∣gin except where the Pages and Scutcheons are not fill'd up which is very rare is pursued through every Reign That of the Conqueror taking up Pages consequently gives account of Noblemen After this the  Noblemen  of every Reign are led up by the Arms of every  King  then reigning in the middle of a Blank Leaf and nothing more written under them than the Name of the King We ob∣serve no  Quarterings  in the King's Arms from the Con∣quest till we come to  Edward  III nor any  Supporters  of or  Badges  over them till then But from hence they con∣stantly appear changing with the several Lines or Races of the said Kings In the Reigns of  William  aforesaid King  James  and King  Charles  are the greatest Number of No∣blemen in which last Baron  Sutton  is the last mention'd  and in the Reigns of  Henry  IV  Richard  III  Henry  VII  Edward  VI  Mary  and  Elizabeth  especially as this last reigned so long there are the fewest Noblemen mention'd Other Observations upon this MS and Deductions from them might be made but at this Time these may suffice in this Place  XX  ACADEMIARUM EXAMEN or  The  EXAMINATION  of  ACA∣DEMIES  Wherein is discussed and examin'd the Matter Method and Customs of Academic and Scholastic Learning and the Insufficiency thereof discover'd and laid open As also some Expedients proposed for the  Reforming  of  Schools  and the perfecting and promoting of all kind of Science Offer'd to the Judgments of all those who love the proficiency of Arts and Sciences and the Advancement of Learning  By JOHN WEBSTER Quarto  Pages    THE Author  Dedicates  this Tract to Major General  Lambert  having had experimental Knowledge and Trial of his Abilities for the reforming of  Academies  and of his sincere Affection and unparallel'd Love to  Learning  In his  Epistle To all who truly love the Advancement of Learning in the  Universities of  Cambridge  and  Oxford  or elsewhere he anticipates several Objections which might be raised against so private a Person as himself for undertaking thus freely to handle an Argument of this publick Nature and Consequence And one of them where he suggests he shou'd be look'd upon as a  Leveller  he answers by say∣ing  "He must needs so far own  Levelling  that he holds  plain  Dealing to be a Jewel and that  plain  Ways seem to him most secure and comfortable That the  Prelacy  tho' it sought to bow him cou'd not break him That tho' the  Presbyterian  Pride did seem to threaten him it cou'd not hurt him and the  Independent  Forms cou'd never inform him beyond the Basis of a better Building than Man can erect That the spoil of Aca∣demies cou'd never please his Mind nor shou'd they  fill his Purse That he was no Dean nor Master Pre∣sident nor Provost Fellow nor Pensioner nor had Tythes appropriate or impropriate Augmentation or State Pay That all the  Levelling  in these Times had not mounted him nor cou'd they make him fall lower And he that wou'd raise himself by the Ruins of others or  warm  himself by the  burning  of  Schools  he wishes no greater Plague than his own  Ignorance  or that he may ever gain more  Knowledge  than to live to repent"  There are certainly many good Observations in the Book and if a few Animadversions might by Critical Exami∣ners be made upon his Style in some Places and per∣haps his Choice of exceptionable Matter or the Efficacy of his Expedients for the Reformation propos'd yet the Work will still demand regard for the eminency of the At∣tempt and a Subject of such great Importance may ren∣der the most imperfect Hints in it so to Heads which can raise out of them more effectual Improvements But in∣deed this Matter is not feebly recommended by the Au∣thor himself as in other Parts of the Work so in the Con∣clusion of the  Epistle  wherein having inform'd us That he intends not to asperse the Person of any nor to traduce or calumniate the  Academies  themselves but only the Corruptions which Time and Negligence have introdu∣ced there and simply to attempt some  Reformation  not  E∣radication  of their Customs and Learning  "He adds which tho' I have peradventure but weakly managed yet I hope my poor Mite with the Candid and Ingeni∣ous will be accepted for the rest I value them not and I intreat the more able to supply what my want of Strength hath left incomplete I have rather intended this as an  Essay  to break the Ice to some more able Judgment than as sufficient of itself to perform what is aimed at because I have neither performed what I shou'd have done nor what I cou'd but only traced out some few clear Things as a guide to higher and more noble Undertakings"  After some Verses by his Friends in praise of the Au∣thor and his Work he enters upon it divided under  Ele∣ven Chapters  in the following Manner I  Of the general Ends of erecting Public Schools  under which he tells us  "If the  Academies  had kept within their own Sphere and on∣ly taught  Human Science  and had not in Pride and VainGlory mounted into the Chariot of the Sun like  Phae∣ton    they had then neither disorder'd nor injur'd  Theo∣logy  that is above them nor the Things of Nature which they account below them"  II  Of the Division of Academic Learning and first of School Theology  Hence having spoken of Perplexities wherein the presumptuous Imaginations of Mankind have ensnared and intangled them∣selves he proceeds to III  The Division of Human Learning and first of Tongues or Languages  Herein the greatest Objection is the making some Sciences meerly speculative as  Philosophy  according to that of  Seneca Nostraque erat  Philosophia  facta  Philologia  est ex qua disputare dicemus non vivere  and the like of  Mathematicks  Then he pro∣ceeds to divide the Sciences in a manner most commodi∣ous for his Purpose beginning with those subservient or conducive to others as  Grammar  under which he com∣mends Dr  Webb  's Enterprize of teaching the  Latin  Tongue by an easy  Clausulary  Method and the elaborate Pains of Mr  Brinsley  So descends to the recommendation of  Hieroglyphical Emblematical Symbolical  and  Cryptographi∣cal  Learning all relative to  Grammar  inferrable from the Labours of  Oughtred Harrington Spanheim Porta Trithe∣mius Agrippa Claramuel Silenus  and Frier  Bacon  with the like Praises of a  Universal Character Dactylogy  the  Real Character  of the  Chinese  and  Jacob Behmen  's  Language of Nature  After his Observations upon these Relatives to Grammar he goes on to discourse in the IV Chapter  Of Logic  And here shews what a  Civil War  of  Words  it is made the Imperfections of  Aristotle  's System and of  Logic  itself with the Consequence of  Tully's Alphabetical  way of  Syllogizing  and concludes with Lord  Bacon  's Opi∣nion of  Logic  as it is abused So we come to V  The Ma∣thematical Sciences  And here he complains how shame∣fully the FoundationStone to this great Building  Arithme∣tic  has been neglected or thrown aside by our  Academic  Masters and but for some private Spirits such as  Napier Briggs Oughtred  and a few others it had lain as a Garden unweeded The like is observed of  Geometry  also how lately by how few and those Foreigners any  Optical  Im∣provements appear'd That  Music  has indeed had some Pains and Honour shew'd to that Part of it which is the concomitant of or Spur to Voluptuousness which is the Companion of Melancholics Fantastics Courtiers Ladies Taverns and Taphouses But any higher Advancements of it for discovering natural Knowledge and the Harmony of the  Universe remains unattempted The Absurdities of our Scholastic Systems of  Astronomy  are next largely laid open as that the Earth is the Centre of the Universe and the hea∣venly Orbs immutable that they are solid Bodies the Ve∣locity of the Tenth Sphere and of the Eighth or Starry Sphere In  Cosmography  the Deficiences are next mention'd especially in the mutual Correspondence and Application of the Heavens and Earth nor are the Theorems of  Hy∣drography  brought into Practice whereby Men might be made able for Navigation  Astrology  notwithstanding all the Derogation of the Schools and Discredit brought upon it by the Ignorance and Knavery of pretended Sciolists our Author recommends as a laudable and profitable Study and arraigns the negligence of Universities for having so lit∣tle regarded the Improvement of  Statics Architecture Pneumatithmy Stratarithmetry  and the rest enumerated by the learned Dr  Dee  in his Preface to  Euclid  Hence we pass VI  To Scholastic Philosophy  Herein  Aristotle  is pull'd to pieces from the beginning to the end and Reasons drawn for denying the Palm to the  Peripatetic  Philosophy from the uncertainty we are in both as to his Books and Doctrine as also the defectiveness of those which we least doubt to be his whence we are led to observe in what Parts of Physical Knowledge the Schools are most deficient and these are  Natural Magic Chymistry Medicine Anatomy Surgery  and  Physiognomy  Coelestial and Subcoelestial  Onei∣rocratics  besides the  Magnetical  Philosophy for which Dr  Gilbert Ridley Carpenter Barlow  and  Cabaeus  are so much commended and the  Atomical  Learning reviv'd by  Descartes  and improv'd by  Magnenus Regius White Dig∣by Phocyllides Holwarda  and others Then we proceed VII  To Metaphysics Ethics Politics Oeconomics Poesy  and  Oratory  Where having shewn what airy insufficient de∣lusive and meer Ornamental Assistances they are made and thus run over some defects of  Academic  Learning tho' not all intimating that a great Part deserves to be eradicated some reform'd and all meliorated in our said Schools he moves on to VIII  Their Customs and Method  leaving their Manners and Maintenance to others Here the first Ob∣jection is that tho' there are divers Houses in one Univer∣sity yet all Students must follow one another like Carriers Horses in one accustom'd Path The second is the sloth∣ful Performance of their Scholastic Exercises their Public Acts being kept but four Times in a Year The Injury of  tying all Men to one set Course of Years before they can re∣ceive their Degrees The ridiculous Levity of their historical Personations in the performance of their Exer∣cises Their empty and windy Disputations therein without any Foundation from Industry or practical Expe∣rience Their Confinement in all Exercises to the  La∣tin  Tongue Too much admiring Antiquity Being bound in with multiplicity of Voices Adhering to Au∣thority especially of  Aristotle  The Immethodical Course of instructing Youth in  Logic  and  Natural Philoso∣phy  before they have tasted the Rudiments of  Mathemati∣cal Knowledge  But as before an old Building is demolish'd a Platform is usually devised for a better So our Author in Cap IX Offers some  Expedients or Remedies in Theology Grammar Logic and Mathematics  wherein though he thinks what he has before produced for demonstrating the ill Composure of the  Scholastic  Fabric of Learning not far from the Truth and tho' he here acknowledges his own Insufficiency to make a more serviceable Substitution yet  In magnis voluisse sat est  He will do his Endea∣vour and hopes that abler Hands will supply his Defects Having offer'd his said Means for regulating the Study of these Sciences he continues after the like manner to treat in Cap X  Of some Helps in Natural Philosophy  in which he highly celebrates the Writings of Dr  Flud  So gives us lastly in Cap XI  Some Expedients concerning their Custom and Method  And hopes they will be acceptable till better be found out  XXI  PLUS ULTRA  or The  Progress  and  Advancement  of  KNOWLEDGE  since the Days of  Aristotle  In an Account of some of the most remarkable late  Improvements  of practical useful  Learning  to encourage  Philosophical En∣deavours  Occasioned by a Conference with one of the  no∣tional  Way  By JOS GLANVILL vo  Pages    Besides Dedication and Preface  THE Intention of this Treatise is by assembling such a Variety as it contains of new Improvements in all Sci∣ences to raise able and pregnant Heads from a drousy Ac∣quiescence in the Discoveries of former Times and tempt them from those Modern Advancements with Encourage∣ments to proceed And tho' the Author intends not a full History of the said Improvements and their Authors yet the most remarkable of them are instanced at least so far as may serve his aim of confuting his Antagonist and exci∣ting Philosophical Endeavours In which he has has a prin∣cipal regard to the  Royal Society  by giving a succinct Ac∣count of the Purposes and Productions of that Illustrious Assembly for the Information of such as have not met with their excellent History  After his  Dedication  to  William  Bishop of  Bath  and  Wells  and his  Preface  to the Clergy of that Diocese we come to the  Work  itself which in the running  Title  is called  Mo∣dern Improvements of useful Knowledge  and is divided into  Eighteen  Chapters tho' the whole is written by way of Letter to a Friend The first Chapter containing his Intro∣duction shews the Occasion of writing this Treatise to have proceeded from a Dispute the Author had with an old Clergyman in his Neighbourhood  His Name was as we find elsewhere Dr  Robert Cross  Rec∣tor of  Chue  in  Somersetshire  in which Country our Author  Glan∣vill  was Rector of  Bath  afterwards Chaplain in Ordinary to King  Charles  II and Prebendary of  Worcester A Wood  says of him  "That he was a Person of more than ordinary Parts of a quick warm spruce and gay Fancy and was more lucky at least in his own Judgment in his first Hints and Thoughts of Things than in his after Notions He had a very tena∣cious Memory and was a great Master of the  English  Language expressing himself therein with easy Fluency and in a manly yet withal a smooth Style"  Tho' the said Dr  Cross  wrote a Book against this  Plus Ultra  he cou'd not get it printed and tho' Dr  Stubbes  also wrote another against it the same was not much regarded See a further Account of this  Plus Ultra  in the  Philos Transactions  N  o    who was so wedded  to the  Peripatetic  Philosophy and extoll'd  Aristotle  so far above all Comparison as to contend  "That he had more Advantages for Knowledge than either the Royal Socie∣ty or all the present Age"  But says our Author in the Conclusion of this Chapter  "As my Lord  Bacon  observes well  Philosophy as well as Faith must be shewn by its Works  And if the  Moderns  cannot shew more of the Works of their Philosophy in six Years than the  Aristote∣lians  can produce of theirs in more than  thrice  so many  hundred  let them be loaded with all that Contempt which is usually the reward of vain and unprofitable Pro∣jectors"  Chap  Is upon the Ways of improving useful Knowledge  First by enlarging the History of Things and next by improving Intercourse and Communications Also upon the Advantages of this Age from the great Advance∣ments of Chymistry and Anatomy Here we have a brief recital of the many Discoveries made in the Body of Man and the Names of the Physicians who made them more par∣ticularly of the  Circulation  and  Transfusion  of the  Blood  Chap  On the Advantage of late Times from the Improvements of Mathematics  particularly in  Arithmetic  by  Logarithms Napier  's  Bones  and  Decimals  also in  Algebra  and  Geometry  and by whom they have been improved Chap Is upon  the Improvements  more particularly in  Geometry  by

Tycho Brahe Copernicus Galilaeo Jacobus Metius  Inventor of the Telescope  Scheiner Kepler Bullialdus Hevelius  and several others ending with Dr  Seth Ward  Bishop of  Sarum  who had demonstratively proved the Elliptical Hypothesis Chap Recites  the Im∣provements of Optics and Geography  Here we learn that  Roger Bacon  so much commended by  Picus Mirandula  and  Vossius  wrote accutely of  Optics  by what Hands  Dioptrics  also were improved and that in  Geography  likewise Improve∣ments have been great as may be found by comparing the Works of some Moderns here named with the best Re∣mains of the Ancients Chap Is upon  the Aids of useful Knowledge by Instruments as the  Telescope Microscope  and  Thermometer Chap  Of the  Barometer  and  Air Pump  and what Advantages we have and may further expect from them  Chap  The Credit of  Optic  Glasses vindicated against his Antagonist  Chap  Our Advantages for Knowledge from Modern Improvements of Natural History  in the  Hea∣vens Air Earth Waters  by several Hands and the  subter∣raneous World  by  Kercher  In  Plants  also by several and  Trees  particularly Mr  Evelyn  from whose  Elysium Britan∣nicum  greater

ELIAS ASHMOLE  of the Middle Temple  Esq  Windsor Herald at Arms A Work furnished with  Variety of Matter  relating to  Honour  and  Noblesse  Fol    Pages  besides the Appendix  THIS elaborate and costly Performance being adorned with fifty CopperPlates etch'd by the famous  Hollar  might have still been more complete by that further Addi∣tion to the  Lives  of the  Knights Companions  which our Au∣thor intended had not some malicious Insinuations withheld the Encouragement he was very near attaining to reim∣burse his Expences therein as we have learn'd from his own Words both in Print and Manuscript  His Words in Print are these  "We once intended a full and entire History of the  Lives  of these Noble  Founders  and to that purpose made a large and chargeable Collection out of the Records in the Tower of  London  and elsewhere of all that we could find worthy to be remember'd in them in which we spent most part of the Years But this our Design being afterwards represented  Feb Anno    Car  II to the present Sovereign and Knights Com∣panions by the late  Chancellor of the Order  through the wrong End of the Perspective we thereby received so great Discou∣ragement as caused us to wave it and indeed resolved wholly to lay it aside Nevertheless upon other Thoughts we are content to let in a  glimpse  of what may be improved to a far greater  Light  and from that Stock of Collections have drawn out some few Things relating to the  Founder  and first  Knights  Companions particularly their Honours Martial Employments famous Exploits Matches Issues and Deaths therein laying down only  Matter of Fact  and  Materials  for  History  without  Deductions  or  Observations  All which we shall deliver with the plainness there found being unwilling to add other Rhetorical Flourishes lest we might withal cast some blemish upon the native Beauty of Truth"  Order of the Garter  fol  But from a MS of his own Writing we find Mr  Ashmole  first took this  Work  of the  Garter  into Consideration about the Year That the Charges of his  Collections  for it amount∣ed to  l  before the Restoration and to no inconsiderable Sum after it Yet observing how meagre the Memorials were which had been preserved of the  Ancient  Companions he peti∣tion'd the King in  August  that his Majesty wou'd add to the other Officers of the Order a particular  Historiographer  and a  Remembrancer  with the Salary of only  l per Ann  as ne∣cessary to transmit their Noble Companions for the future more suitably to Posterity and modestly hoped to have the same be∣stow'd upon himself as what might bring some Authority to his Performance lighten his Charges and raise him above the de∣triment of Censure King  Charles  having been inform'd of his  Reasons Labour Expences  and  Qualifications  signed a Warrant for the same directed to Sir  Henry de Vic Chancellor  of the  Order  authorizing the Patent to be pass'd under the Seal thereof But the said Chancellor refused to pass it under pre∣tence of Mr  Ashmole  's Irregularity in procuring it and not only alledg'd he ought to have obtained his first Grant by the Hand of the said  Chancellor  and the  Chapter  that is as Mr  Ashmole  himself words it have sought it of those who wou'd obstruct it but in  Feb  laid an  Information  thereof before the  Chapter  then held and Mr  Ashmole  was not admitted either to make a  Defence  of himself or shew the  Advantages  of the  Office  propo∣sed so it was laid aside and he presented a Draught in Writing of the  Objections  there made against such an Institution and his  Answers  thereto which he dedicated in  Dec  to the Lord  Chancellor  of  England  From which MS  Of his Arguments for an Historiographer and Remembrancer to the Order of the Garter  we have extracted thus much of this Paragraph and shall only observe that such a discouragement of an Attempt  to write Hi∣stories and Lives of such Great Men in the complete Circuite of their Stories  seems no ways wonderful For this is  Biography  in its strict Sense which is of a searching Nature and however useful or acceptable to the generality as irksome to some Thoughts as Light to some Eyes yea may be as terrible to some among the Living as to others the Expectation of being  anatomiz'd  when they are dead However King  Charles  re∣warded this Author who thus  ennobled  even the most  Noble  Or∣der like a Prince who deserved to be as he was the  Sovereign  thereof with Places of above a  Thousand Pounds  a Year and not long after the Book was publish'd and inscrib'd to his Majesty Mr  Ashmole  further received a Privy Seal out of the Custom of Paper for  Four Hundred Pounds  as we find in the  Diary  he left behind him of his own  Life    The Work itself is not without some seeming Respect to the Subjects of it distinguish'd into  Twentysix Chapters  and they subdivided into several  Heads  containing many cu∣rious Remarks and Instructions of Antiquity and not only concerning the  Legal  and  Ceremonial  Parts of this  Order  but of many other Institutions Customs Habits and Forms of Honourable Distinction among Mankind As may be best seen by the  Particulars  of those Chapters and Heads which are here drawn together with some necessary Enlargements from the Bodies also of those Heads that the  Contents  of the Book may be the better known and our Readers ac∣commodated with the greater Variety of Intelligence  Chap I  Treats of Knighthood in general  Which be∣gins with a Section upon  Vertue  and  Honour  shewing that Virtue is encouraged by Reward and that Honour is the re∣ward of Military Vertue that they were deified by the  Ro∣mans  who built them various Temples and we have here the Sculpture of one erected for  Vertue  which stood before that

and a Refutation of  Polydore Virgil  's Fiction of its rise from  the King's taking up the Queen's or his Mi∣stress's Garter  Hence we are led to the  True Cause  of this Martial Foundation which was to emulate  King Arthur's Round Table  so we proceed to  the Time when it was institu∣ted  and here it appearing that King  Edward  's Robes for the  first  Feast not being made till the d or

 compyled by  VYRGYLE  whiche hathe be translated oute of  Latyne  into  Frenshe  and oute of  Frenshe  reduced into  Englysshe  by me  William Caxton the    Daye of Juyn the Yere of our Lorde  Fol  THIS Work contains not an entire Version of two or three Books only of  Virgil  's  Aeneid  as some might imagine from the slender Bulk of the Book nor is it here translated into Verse as they might also expect in imita∣tion of the Original and as nothing appears to the contrary in the Title above printed at the End but it is rather a Reduction of that  Epic Poem  to an  historical  Narrative in  Prose  which tho' a commendable Undertaking at that time to familiarize the Contents yet as it is but a Trans∣lation of a Translation as the Original itself is familiar e∣nough now and we have also many better Translations even in Verse directly from it the very Table of Heads no less than sixtyfive cannot be in this Place desirable Therefore we shall only refer to a Note at Bottom  And first of the  French Author  who as he begins his Work so high as the Building of  Troy  by  Priamus  so he con∣tinues it beyond the Slaughter of  Turnus  by  Aeneas  to the Suc∣cession of his Son  Ascanius  and two or three Sucessions beyond Moreover towards the beginning of his Work that is in  Chapter  he has a Digression upon  Bocace  for relating the Story of  Dido  in his  Fall of Princes  differently from  Virgil  and recites his Account as well as that of his Author And in  Cap  he passes over  Aeneas  his Descent into Hell  because 'tis feign'd and not to be believed  as if several other Parts of this Story which he has repeated were not as incredible as that But to pass to the Translator and  Printer  we observe his Style to be more  ornate  as he calls it or dress'd up in superfine Words especially of the  French  Extract than we believe it would have been had he not submitted it to the Correction It is more regularly printed than that former of his described in our last Number as not running out but having the Lines all even at the Ends and large  Initials  at the beginning of every Chapter It has also  Signatures  at the Bottom of the Pages and besides Commas and Periods Colons and Semicolons or what might be designed as such tho' not always placed perhaps to an∣swer the Purpose of them  for  a few Remarks upon the Work itself and here recite the Translator's  Preface  which contains such observable Proofs of the fleeting Fashions in our  English  Tongue as may mo∣derate the Conceits of those who depend upon a Style or Manner of Expression more than the Matter expressed that will not like most other things become obsolete but maintain its Perspicuity and engage the Taste of all Ages  This  Preface  containing near two Leaves is as follows  "After dyverse Werkes made translated and achieved hav∣ing noo Werke in hande I sittyng in my Studye where∣as laye many dyverse Paunflettis and Bookys happened that to my Hande cam a lytyl Booke in  Frenshe  which late was translated out of  Latyn  by some Noble Clerke of  Fraunce  whiche Booke is named  Eneydos  made in  Latyn  by that noble Poete and grete Clerke  Vyrgyle  Which Booke I sawe over and redde therein how after the generall Destruccyon of the grete  Troye Eneas  departed beryng his olde Fader  Anchises  upon his Sholdres his lityl Son  Yolus  on his Honde his Wyfe wyth moche other People followynge and how he shypped and departed wyth alle th Hystorye of his Adventures that he had 'er he cam to the Achievement of his Conquest of  Ytalye  as all a longe shall be shewed in this present Boke In which Booke I had grete Playsyr by cause of the fayr and honest Terms and Wordes in  Frenshe  which I never sawe to fore lyke ne none so playsaunt ne so wel ordred Which Booke as me semed sholde be moche requysite to Noble Men to see as wel for the Eloquence as the Hystoryes how wel that many honderd Yerys passed was the sayd Booke of  Eneydos  with other Werkes made and learned dayly in Scolis specyally in  Ytalye  and other Places Whiche Historye the sayd  Vyrgyle  made in Metre And whan I had advised me in this sayd Booke I delybered and concluded to translate it into  Englyshe  and forthwyth toke a Pen and Ynke and wrote a Leef or tweyne which I oversawe agayn to corecte it and whan I sawe the fayr and straunge Termes therein I doubted that it sholde not please some Gentylmen whiche  late blamed me saying that in my Translacyons I had over curyous Termes which coude not be understande of comyn Peple and desired me to use olde and homely Termes in my Translacyons and fayn wolde I satysfye every Man And so to doo toke an olde Boke and redde therein and certaynly the  Englysshe  was so rude and brood that I coude not well understande it And also my Lord Abbot of  Westmynster  ded do shewe to me of late certayn Evydences wryton in old  Englisshe  for to reduce it into our  Englysshe  now usid and certaynly it was wreton in such wyse that it was more lyke to  Dutche  than  Englysshe  I coude not reduce ne brynge it to be understonden And certaynly our Langage now used varyeth ferre from that which was used and spoken whan I was born for we  Englyssh  Men ben borne un∣der the Domynacyon of the  Mone  which is never sted∣faste but ever waverynge wexyng one Season and waneth and dyscreaseth another Season and that comyne  Englysshe  that is spoken in one Shyre varyeth from another In so muche that in my dayes happened that certayn Merchauntes were in a Shipp in  Tamyse  for to have sayled over the See into  Zelande  and for lacke of Wynde they taryed atte  Forlond  and went to lande for to refreshe them and one of them named  Sheffelde  a Mercer came into an Hows and axed for Mete and specyally  he axed for Eggs  and the goode Wyf answerde that  she coude speke no Frenshe  and the Marchaunt was angry for he also coude speke no  Frenshe  but wolde have hadde Egges and she understode hym not And thenne at laste another sayd That  he wolde have Eyren  then the good Wyf sayd that she understod him wel Loo what sholde a Man in thyse Days wryte  Egges  or  Eyren  Cer∣taynly it is harde to playse every Man by cause of Dy∣versite and Chaunge of Langage For in these Days every Man that is in ony Reputacyon in his Countre will utter his Communicacyon and Matters in such Man∣ners and Termes that fewe Men shall understonde them and som honest and grete Clerkes have ben wyth me and desired me to wryte the moste curyous Termes that I coude fynde And thus bytween playn rude and cu∣rious I stand abasshed But in my Judgemente the comyn Termes that be dayli used ben lyghter to be un∣derstonde than the old auncyent  Englysshe  And for as moche as this present Booke is not for a rude uplondyssh  Man to laboure therin ne rede it but only a Clerk and a noble Gentleman that feleth and understondeth in Fayles of Armes in Love and in noble Chyvalry ther∣for in meane bytwene bothe I have reduced and transla∣ted this sayd Booke into our  Englisshe  not over rude ne curyous but in such Termes as shall be understanden by Goddys Grace accordyng to my Copye And yf ony Man wyll entermete in redyng of hit and fyndeth suche Termes that he cannot understande late hym goo rede and lerne  Vyrgyll  or the Pystles of  Ovyde  and ther he shall see and understande lightly all yf he have a good Redar and Enformer for this Booke is not for every rude and unconnynge Man to see but Clerkys and very Gen∣tylmen that understands Gentylnes and Scyence Then I praye alle theym that shall rede in this lytyl Treatys to holde me for excused for the translatynge of hit For I knowleche myselfe ignorant of connynge to enpryse on me so hie and noble a Werke But I praye Mayster  John Skelton  late created  Poete Laureate  in the Unyversite of  Oxenforde  to oversee and correcte this sayd Booke and taddresse and expowne where as shall be founde faulte to theym that shall requyre it For hym I knowe for suffy∣cyent to expowne and  Englysshe  every Dyfficulte that is therein For he hath late translated the  Epystles  of  Tulle  and the Booke of  Dyodorus Syculus  and diverse other Werkes oute of  Latyn  into  Englisshe  not in rude and olde Langage but in polysshed and ornate Termes craftely as he that hath redde  Vyrgyle Ovyde Tullye  and all the other noble Poetes and Oratours to me unknowen And also he hath redde the IX Muses and understands their musicalle Scyences and to whom of them eche Scyence is appropred I suppose he hath dronken of  Elycon  's Well Then I praye hym and such other to correcte adde or mynysshe whereas he or they shall fynde faulte for I have but folowed my Copye in  Frensshe  as nygh as me is possible And yf ony Worde be sayd therin well I am glad and yf otherwyse I sub∣mytte my said Boke to theyr Correctyon which Boke I presente unto the hye born my tocomynge Naturell and Soverayne Lord  Arthur  by the Grace of God Prynce of  Walys  Duc of  Cornewayll  and Erle

Lorde of  Ireland  by∣seching his noble Grace to receyve it in Thanke of me his most humble Subget and Servaunt And I shall praye unto Almighty God for his prosperous encreasyng in Vertue Wysdom and Humanyte that he may be egal with the most renouned of alle his noble Progenytours and so to lyve in this present Lyf that after this transito∣rye Lyf he and we all may come to everlastynge Lyf in Heven  Amen  "  XXIV  The  HISTORIE  of  Cambria  now called  WALES  a Part of the most famous  Yland  of  BRYTAINE  written in the  British  Language above  Two Hundred  Years past Trans∣lated into  English  by  H LHOYD Gent  Corrected aug∣mented and continued out of Records and best approved Authors by  DAVID POWEL  Doctor in Divinity  Quarto  THO' there is no Date in the  Title Page  of this History we have ventured to add the same that appears at the End of the  Dedication  which is made thereof to  the Right Worshipful Sir Philip Sidney  by the said Dr  Powel  Herein this Editor instead of extolling the noble Gifts and Vertues in his said Patron which were conspicuous to all Men exhorts him to the diligent Exercise of them and particu∣larly from those domestick Examples his noble  Father  constantly inclined more to benefit even  Wales  and  Ireland  besides his own Country than himself and his honourable FatherinLaw Sir  Francis Walsingham  the Queen's Chief Secretary whose Zeal for God's Glory and Love of those who feared him unfeignedly was well known to the World  "Follow says he their Footsteps with the Remembrance of that noble House out of which you are descended by your honourable Mother and then you cannot do a∣miss Labour by the Example of your Father  to dis∣cover and bring to light the Acts of the famous Men of elder Times  who with Conference of the State and Go∣vernment of all Ages will bring you to the perfect  Ex∣perience  of those things that you have learned out of  Aris∣totle Plato  and  Cicero  by your Travel in Philosophy Your Father with his great Expences and Labour hav∣ing procured and gotten to his hands the  Histories of Wales and Ireland  which Countries for many Years with great Love and Commendation he govern'd committed unto me  this of Wales  to be set forth in Print with Direction to proceed therein and necessary Books for the doing thereof And altho' I was unsufficient for doing of it yet I have done mine Endeavour and now do present the same unto your Worship as by good Reason due to the Son and Heir of Him that was the Procurer and Bringer of it to light"  c  From the Editor's  Epistle to the Reader  his  Notes  on the  History  and the Beginning thereof itself we learn That this  Succession of the British Princes  was the Work of  Carodoc  of  Lancarvan  from the Reign of  Cadwalader  the last  British  Monarch over the  whole Island  who fled into  Armorica  or  Bretagne  Anno and died at  Rome  eight Years after with whose Departure to that Part of  France  and a List of the  British  Kings ruling there this  History  begins down to some Years of  Owen Gwyneth  's Reign over that  Part of the Island  now called  Wales  that is to the Year or the d of  Henry  II King of  England  as may be seen  p  The  Continuation  which follows for Years from that time was yearly register'd in the Abbeys of  Con∣way  and  Stratflur  down to the Year or the th of our  Henry  III which was a little before the Death of the last  Lhewelyn  and here ends this  British Chronicle  as ap∣pears  p  Many Copies remained of it at this time in  Wales  most of them Years old and one of them coming to the hands of Mr  Humphrey Lhoyd  a learned and skillful Antiquary he translated it into clear smooth  English  and continued it chiefly out of  Matt Paris  and  Nicholas Trivet  to the Slaughter of the said Prince  Lhew∣elyn  the last of  British  Blood who had the Dominion of  Wales  in or the tenth of our  Edward  I that is to  page  of this Volume But before this Translation and Continuation were thoroughly polished by the said  H Lhoyd  he was taken away by Death in the Flower of his Time Yet the Copy of his Labour being procured and preserved by Sir  Henry Sidney  Lord President of  Wales  he prefer'd our Editor Dr  Powel  to the Care of its Publication who procuring all the printed Histories which treated of  Wales  and the Use of all  John Stow  's MS Histories and many Books of  British  Pedegrees from the Lord  Burghley  with his Authority for searching all the  Records  did not only correct the said Translation but put marginal References in it to those Historians who treated of the particular Facts and additional Notes likewise throughout of Matters relating to  Wales  in those Historians unmentioned in his Copy also interspersed the same with many authentic In∣struments Records and Pedigrees and lastly made a fur∣ther Continuation  Of the Princes of Wales of the Blood Royal of England  and the  Lords President  down to his own Time the whole ending with the aforesaid Sir  Henry Sidney  at  page  So that Authors have been too indi∣stinct when they have quoted every Part of this Book un∣der one Name Thus much for the general View now to be a little more particular  After the Editor's Epistle before mentioned follows a  Description of Cambria now called Wales Drawn first by  Sir  John Prise  and  afterwards augmented by H Lhoyd  and here prefixed for the better understanding of this Hi∣story Herein upon the Name of  Wallia  there is Occasion taken by the said  Lhoyd  it seems to make a liberal Cen∣sure of  Polydore Virgil  being a Stranger as well to many of our Histories as the Tongues they are written in and a Reference made to the  Apology  of Sir  John Prise  and the  British  History he purposely writ against the envious Reports and slaunderous Taunts of the said  Polydore  whose Errors in great number are there confuted And it is fur∣ther shewn that  Wales  is a new and strange Name which the  Britains  do not understand that they know no other than  Cambry  nor of their Language than  Cambraec  or the  Cambers  Tongue That they know not what  England  or  English  means but call the Country  Lhoyger  from  Locrine  the  Englishmen Sayson  and their Tongue  Saysonaec  which is a Token this is the old  British  Language For the Works of  Merdhyn  and of  Taliessin  who wrote above Years past are almost the same Words as they use at this Day or at least understood by all who know the  Welsh Tongue  Then he discourses of the Three Remnants of the  Britains  in  Wales Cornwal  and little  Britain  or  Bre∣tagne  in  France  The Bounds of  Wales  and the Division thereof into  Three  Territories that is  NorthWales SouthWales  and  PowysLand  subdivided into their several  Candreds  and  Comots  and all express'd in their old  British  Names  Thus we come to the History which has a little wooden  Print  at the Head of every Chapter or Prince's Reign more for Ornament we presume than real Resemblance because they are discontinued at the  English  Princes of  Wales  of whom some true Representation was more likely to be recovered The History is too short to be made shorter by any thing that looks like an Epitomy besides it cannot prudently be desired we should be so long confined from the Description of other Books as to give an Abstract of every Prince's Reign in this It may be therefore suffi∣cient that we here draw out a  Table  of their  Names  with a Chronology of their  Deaths  and the Names of those Princes who were their  Contemporaries  in  England  which will be of general Use in Reading any other Piece of  Welsh  History  In Wales  Died  In England  Cadwalader    Saxons Angles Jutes  c  Juor    Kentwin  c  RoderikMolwynoc    Ethelard  c  Conan Tindaethy    Offa  c  Mervyn Urych

so well or easily known that they need not be here drawn out in like manner All therefore we shall further men∣tion will be of the Editor's  Notes  with the most obser∣vable  Instruments Records  and

Traffiques and Disco∣veries of the  ENGLISH NATION  made by Sea or over Land to the remote and farthest distant Quarters of the Earth within the Compass of these    Years Divided into  Three several Volumes  according to the Positions of the Regions whereunto they were directed The  First Volume  containeth the worthy  Discoveries c  of the  English  toward the  North  and  NorthEast  by Sea  c  with many Testimonies of the ancient foreign  Trades  the warlike and other  Shipping of this Realm  with a Com∣mentary of the true State of  Iceland  the Defeat of the  Spa∣nish  Armada and the Victory at  Cadiz  By  RICHARD HAKLUYT M A  sometime Student of  ChristChurch  in  Oxford Fol  To this is joined  The  Second Volume  comprehending the principal Navigations  c  of the  ENGLISH NATION  to the  South and SouthEast  Parts of the World as well  within  as  without  the Streight of  Gibraltar  within the Compass of    Years Divided into  two  several  Parts  By  R HAKLUYT c Folio Both  Volumes  are bound together the for∣mer consisting of Pages the latter of the first Part and the last besides Dedications Preface and Tables of Contents And both printed by  Geo Bishop Ralph Newberie  and  Rob Barker  The  Third  and  Last Volume  of the Voyages  c  of the  ENGLISH NATION c  within and before these    Years to all Parts of the Newfound World of  America  or the  WestIndies  from    Degrees of  Northerly  to    of  Southerly  Latitude c Collected by  RICHARD HAKLUYT c  Imprinted  as before Folio Pages  This elaborate and excellent  Collection  which redounds as much to the Glory of the  English  Nation as any Book that ever was published in it having already had sufficient Complaints made in its behalf against our suffering it to become so scarce and ob∣scure by neglecting to  translate  it into the Universal Language or at least to  republish  it in a fair Impression with proper Illus∣trations and especially an  Index  wherewith the Author him∣self supply'd the first Edition printed in one Volume  Folio  we shall not here repeat those Complaints because we must necessarily wait for the Return of that Spirit which ani∣mated the gallant Adventurers recorded therein to so many heroic Exploits before we can expect such a true Taste of Delight will prevail to do them so much Justice or that  Envy  of tran∣scendent Worth will permit a noble  Emulation  of it so far to per∣petuate the Renown of our said Ancestors as to render by this means their Memory no less durable and extensive than their Merits have demanded For it may perhaps be thought im∣politic thus to display the most hazardous and the most generous Enterprises which appear in this Book for the Honour and Advantage of our Country till the Vertues of our  Predecessors  will not reflect disadvantageous Comparisons upon the  Posterity  who shall revive them But there may be still room left for a more favourable Construction of such Neglect and to hope that no∣thing but the casual Scarcity or Obscurity of a Work so long since out of Print may have prevented its falling into those able and happy Hands as might by such an Edition reward the eminent  Examples  preserved therein

wherefore we shall here take our leave of it with re∣ferring only to a needful Observation or two at the Bot∣tom  And  first  As it has been so useful to many of our Authors not only in  Cosmography  and  Navigation  but in  History  especi∣ally that of the glorious Reign in which so many brave Exploits were atchieved As it has been such a  leading Star  to the  Naval Histories  since compiled and saved from the Wreck of Oblivion many exemplary Incidents in the Lives of our most renowned  Navigators  it has therefore been unworthily omitted in the  Eng∣lish Historical Library  And  lastly  Tho' the first Volume of this  Collection  does frequently appear by the Date in the Title Page to be printed in the Reader is not thence to conclude the said Volume was then reprinted but only the Title Page as upon collating the Books we have observed and fur∣ther that in the said last printed Title Page there is no men∣tion made of the  Cadiz  Voyage to omit which might be one Reason of reprinting that Page For it being one of the most prosperous and honourable Enterprizes that ever the Earl of  Essex  was ingaged in and he falling into the Queen's unpar∣donable Displeasure at this time our Author Mr  Hakluyt  might probably receive Command or Direction even from one of the Patrons to whom these Voyages are dedicated who was of the contrary Faction not only to suppress all Memorial of that Action in the Front of this Book but even cancel the whole  Narrative  thereof at the  End  of it in all the Copies far the greatest Part of the Impression which remained unpub∣lished And in that castrated Manner the Volume has descended to Posterity not but if the Castration was intended to have been concealed from us the last Leaf of the Preface would have been reprinted also with the like Omission of what is there mentioned concerning the Insertion of this Voyage But at last about the middle of the late King's Reign an uncastrated Copy did arise and the said Voyage was reprinted from it whereby many imperfect Books have been made complete    XXVI  Enquiries  touching the  DIVERSITY  of  LANGUAGES  and  RELIGIONS  through the chief Parts of the World Writ∣ten by  EDW BREREWOOD  lately Professor of  Astronomy  in  GRESHAM COLLEGE  in  LONDON  Printed by  John Bill to Pages besides Dedication Preface  c  THIS learned Treatise being published after the Au∣thor's Death is  dedicated  to the Archbishop of  Can∣terbury  by  Robert Brerewood  who as it is thought did also compose the  Preface  to the Reader shewing the  Oc∣casions  the Author had to write the ensuing  Discourse  and briefly describing the general State of  Protestants  in  Europe  for a Supply to the said Work  It is divided into  Twentyseven Chapters  and treats  first Of the antient Largeness  or Extent  of the  Greek  Tongue  and the Causes thereof with its Declension upon the Inundation of the  Saracens  about Years after our Saviour in the Time of  Heraclius  the Emperor More particularly  of the Decay of the antient pure Greek  and of the present vulgar  Greek  nevertheless that the present Language does not so much decline from the ancient  Greek  as the  Italian  departs from the  Latin  according to  Bello∣nius  for that there were Corruptions even in the ancient  Greek  however it is concluded that the Skilful in the learned  Greek  cannot understand the  vulgar    Of the Extent of the Roman Tongue in the time of the Roman Empire  with the Causes of its spreading and in what Parts of the Em∣pire it was most spoken That it was little respected in the  Eastern  Parts thereof and why  That the Roman Tongue abolished not the vulgar Languages in the foreign Provinces of the Roman Empire  but that near fourteen Tongues here mention'd in which Number the  English Italian Spanish  and  French  are not reckoned our Author instancing only Original or Mother Languages were in  Europe  in the Time of the  Roman  Empire and six or seven of them within the Limits of it From hence it is observed how hard it is to sup∣plant vulgar Languages in populous Countries That neither the  Punic  nor the  Gallic  the  Spanish  or  Pannonian  Tongue was abolished by the  Romans  and that the  Latin  was nei∣ther generally nor perfectly spoken in the  Provinces    Of the beginning of the Italian French and Spanish Languages  with the Ruin of the  Roman  Empire when and by whom and that Barbarous Nations were not the first Authors of those degenerate Languages but rather Promoters of their Corruptions  Objections touching the Extent of the Latin Tongue answered  That it was never purely spoken in the foreign Provinces that there were great Changes in it whereof he concludes with a pregnant Example from the Inscription upon that naval Column they call it  Columnam Rostratam  being deck'd with the Beaks of Ships in the Capitol at  Rome  which Inscription tho' composed not above Years before the Tongue shone in its full Lustre under  Cicero  has not one Word in it spell'd like the later  Latin  that is subjoined An Example which may give the  English  Tongue some Countenance tho' our Author does men∣tion an Instance or two also of its Mutability since it is in a far larger Compass of Years  Of the Ancient Languages of Italy Spain France and Africa  That the  Punics  of  Afri∣ca  were originally  Canaanites  or  Phoenicians  and that the  Punic  Language was the old  Hebrew  Tongue and tho' that  Punic  Speech in  Plautus  which is the only Specimen of it extant hath no great Affinity with the  Hebrew  yet 'tis im∣puted to the Corruptions of

Regions in the World inhabited by Idolaters  what Part of  Africa  possessed by them and what Parts of  Asia  their vast Extent in  America    Of the Jews dispersed in several Parts of the World  the State of them in  Europe Asia  and  Africa Tartars  suspected to be of the  Israelites  Race That  Americans  are the Progeny of the  Tartars  That many Nations are circumcised besides the  Israelites  and therefore that Circumcision is no sure Token of Descent from them That the  Tartarians  are not the Offspring of the  Israelites  That the second Book of  Es∣dras  contradicts the Scripture That the  Israelites  departed not out of the Dominion of  Assyria  that  Arsareth  was a feigned Mansion of the  Israelites  and that their Voyage and remote Retirement favours of the same  Talmudisal  Spirit with that other Tale of the reason why God ap∣pointed the Sea for the  Whale  and the Land for the  Ele∣phant  because they were too big to be Inhabitants together in either of those Elements

of the Ceremonies  to the two last  Kings  touching the Reception and Precedence the Treatment and Audience the Puntillios and Contests of  Forren AMBASSADORS  in  ENGLAND With this Motto  Legati ligant Mundum  vo London Pages besides the Dedication and Table  THIS curious Book containing the Author's  Observa∣tions  on the Treatment and Contests of  foreign Ambas∣sadors  in  England  from the Year to the Year inclusive was published after the Author's Death from the Manuscript by his intimate Acquaintance Mr  James Howell  The Editor in his Dedication to  Philip  Lord Viscount  Lisle  gives this Account of the Author  "Among other Parts of Industry which were known to be in that worthy Knight one was to couch in Writing and keep an ex∣act  Diary  of what things had passed in his Province as  Master of the Ceremonies  "  And he observes that  "No∣thing is taken here upon Trust but all upon the Author's own Knowledge being still upon the Place himself and an Actor in everything  We may further add The Author was by King  James  I a∣bout the Middle of his Reign made Assistant to Sir  Lewis Lewkner Master of the Ceremonies  in which Service he acquitted himself with great Honour and Fidelity whereupon King  Charles  after his Father's Death not only continued him in hi  Place but gave him a reversionary Grant of the Office of  Master of the Ceremo∣nies  which came to his Possession by the Death of Sir  Lewis  th of  March  During his whole Service he applied himself with great Assiduity retiring only when Occasion would serve to his Countryhouse at  Twittenham  It was his constant Maxim to give the least Occasion to and avoid as much as possi∣ble the too nice Punctillios of  Procedence  between Ambassadors which seldom fail to breed Animosities in their Sovereigns And by this means he was not only much esteemed by the Ambassadors which turned greatly to his Advantage with regard to their usual Presents but he likewise prevented the Trouble that wou'd have ensued to his Majesty of hearing their frivolous Complaints As to this Work it was the Au∣thor's Method as appears by the Editor's  Dedication  to couch in Writing what things passed in his Province not only for his own but for the Information of others and his Notes were more than once as appears by his own Words produced to the Lord  Chamberlain  to regulate by Precedents the Differences which happened between Ambassadors And in one of his Ob∣servations  page  he says he does it  "  for future Occasions and Use to the Master of the Ceremonies  "  which plainly shews his Intention  that these Observations  shou'd be made publick and to every one in that Province they may no doubt be of great Use and Instruction And they may be of further and still greater Use as well in illustrating some Parts of Mons  Wiquefort  as the  English  History in that Period well known to have so much abounded in Embassies and in the Particulars whereof our Hi∣storians of those Times are very deficient not having had the Light of these Observations  Anthony Wood  who informs us that he lived to the Age of Years and died in yet gives us no Account how long he remained in his Office nor why he so abruptly discontinued his Observations But we have heard there now is an original or authentick MS of them in being which might give further Intelligence in this Particular  "  The Work

our Laws stood Contemporary thro' all Ages since the Conquest also what great and noble Families have sprung from those Roots and lastly rectify the common Mistakes among young Students in reading the ancient  YearBooks  where they are apt to mistake the  Judge  for the  Pleader  and the  Abbreviations  of Judges  Names  for their proper and perfect Appellations"  Our Author was at the Expence of Engraving the Heads or Effigies of some of the Chancellors and Judges men∣tioned in these Tables but they are differently bound up sometimes before sometimes after them and sometimes interspersed in the Chronology against the Pages where their Creations are mentioned These Heads are those of Sir  John Clench  etch'd by  Hollar  Sir  Edward Coke  graved by  D Loggan  Sir  Randolph Crew  and Sir  Robert Heath  by  Hollar  the Earl of  Clarendon  by  Loggan  to which Chan∣cellor the first Edition of this Book being inscrib'd his Print is often bound therein at the beginning thereof and fur∣ther which are not in the first Edition Sir  Orlando Bridg∣man  graved by  Faithorne  which is in the second and last Editions and Sir  John Vaughan  by  White  which is only in this last So that the last Edition has with Mr  Selden  's Head before mentioned three Cuts more than the first  But those in that are as must be expected of more lively and perfect Impression At the End of these  Tables  we have in one Page a Continuation of the Catalogues of the  Readers  and  Treasurers  of the  Inner Temple Middle Temple Lincoln'sInn  and  Gray'sInn  which should have followed at the end of those Catalogues in their respective Places had what passes for this last Edition been entirely reprinted but except the TitlePage at the beginning of the Book and three Leaves at the end continuing the Chro∣nology and Catalogues aforesaid 'tis the same with the second Impression and they are so much worse than the first by how much the  Errata  of the Press in them are more numerous however this last Edition sells in the Shops sometimes for as much again as the first And this is all we have here to remark of this Book from our pre∣sent Review of it and the Opportunity we have had of collating the several Editions What others have observed we refer to below  Of these Editions we shall only add That the  first  was published in that the  historical  Part consists of Pages and the  Chronology  of when the Figures of the Pages are rightly corrected ending at the Year The  second  Edi∣tion was printed has in the  historical  Part like this last Pages and in the  chronological  ending at the Year  Ant Wood  says  "That of the first Impression many Co∣pies were burnt by the Fire of  London  "  And that  "in the  Chronica Series  are many Faults"  which will not so much be wondered at by those who have read how much of it was now first calculated and in a manner guessed at thro' the Defect of Registers as that for such a Space of Time the Author should be able to settle so many Persons in their respective Places Bishop  Nicholson  is of Opinion  "That our first Enquiries after the  History  of the  Laws  of this Kingdom ought to begin with the careful reading of  this  Book which we shall find so ac∣curately penn'd and with so good a Mixture of Learning and Judgment that it will almost do the Work alone That he cannot give a better View of this most elaborate Treatise than by telling the Reader it fully answers its TitlePage giving as compleat a History as it was possible for one Man to furnish us with of the Particulars therein mentioned That under all these Heads the Collections are many and the Method exact so that we have abundance without Super∣fluity and all we can wish for without the hazard of being cloy'd That in the  Chronology  if any thing hath escaped the Search of so diligent and curious a Writer the Tables are so ordered that every Reader's additional Discoveries are quickly marshall'd and tribed under their proper Columns And lastly That out of these and  Rastal  's  Table  of  Years  were stoln the  Chronica Juridicialia  "  which is printed in  o      XXIX  The  NATURAL HISTORY  of  STAFFORDSHIRE  By  ROB PLOT  LL D Keeper of the Ashmolean Musaeum  and  Professor  of  Chymistry  in the University of  Oxford Fol  Oxford Pages  THIS Work by the Title seemingly confined to the remarkable Productions of  Nature  only in  one  Coun∣ty therefore under that Consideration alone particularly engaging to all ingenious  Natives  thereof is nevertheless such an extensive Field of curious and instructive Matter so various in its kinds yet connected by such easy Transi∣tions and supported by such pertinent Parallels as have rendered it of a more general or comprehensive Nature so as to become a Pattern tho' scarcely equal'd to several  Writers  who have attempted the Illustration of other Coun∣ties in the like manner and may indeed be coveted by all  Readers  who delight in  natural  Knowledge  It is dedicated by the Author to King  James  because of the Approbation his Majesty had shewn to his  History  of  Oxford  and after his short  Preface  we have the  Verses  of  T Lane  to the said King  James  II upon occasion of the Author's presenting him this Work Also others to the Author himself by Mr  J Norris  in  English  and  S Wel∣sted  in  Latin  After this the Work is faced with a most ac∣curate  Map  of the County inscrib'd by the Author to the Lord Lieutenant thereof  Charles Talbot  Earl of  Shrewsbury  It is graved on a large Sheet folding in by  Joseph Brown  having the  Arms  of all the Gentry in the County display'd about the Margins and such mutual  References  that any Stranger seeing a  Seat  in the Map may most readily find the  Arms  and  Name  that belong to it or knowing only the  Name  shall as quickly find his  Arms  and  Seat  Yet we have the further Convenience for the less apprehensive Reader of an  Explanation  prefixed and an  alphabetical  List of all the  Parishes Villages  and  Houses  delineated therein  As to his Method that which he formerly prescribed himself in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  being approv'd of he follows the same here whereby the whole Work is divided into  Ten Chapters  which are interspersed with  thirtyseven  Copper  Prints  of the chief  Seats  and  Views Curiosities  of  Nature  and  Antiquities  found in the County each Print inscribed to the Owners of those Seats or other eminent Natives of the said Shire  Chapter  I treats of what has been observable among them  in the Heavens and Air  as particularly the Remark of the  Moorland  Inhabitants upon the  Sunset  in the Summer Solstice also the  MockSuns  frequent in this County Remarkable  Rainbows  as of the Moon and  Halo's  of the Sun Strange Effects of  Thunder  and  Lightning  with an elaborate Digression upon  Fairy Circles  which tho' he indulges so far the Accounts of  Remigius  and others who impute the  same  to Wizards and Witches as to recite them yet at last more pro∣bably imputes them to Lightning Then we come to his Re∣marks on Animals especially on the mortal Effects of  Thun∣der  upon Crevices and Lobsters Several strange  Meteors Noises  in  the Air  Extraordinary  Hail  Storms and prodi∣gious  Showers  particularly of Frogs Maggots  c Prog∣nosticks  of  Showers  and  Winds  of the  Tornado  Wind and uncommon  Echoes  which with an Experiment upon  Sounds  and some short Observations on the  Comet  in ends this Chapter  Chap II  Of the Waters  This is introduced with a  Discourse  of nine Pages upon the  Effects  of  Air  on human Bodies And among many other Observations some on Unction and Painting of the Body to prevent the Depre∣dations thereof from  Roger Bacon  The Choice of healthy Situations with many Examples which brings him to the Consideration of  Waters  by which the Air is so much af∣fected Several Remarks on the pure Streams and  Waters  of  common Use  in this County and particularly the refresh∣ing Pool of  Madely  mentioned by  Gervase  of  Tilbury  In∣stances of Health in the  Moorlands  from the Age of twelve Tenants who made up Years and four who made Years Then speaks of the more  unusual Waters  their Discolourations Prognostications of Rain and Dearth  Noisiness Inconstancy of Flowing and Intermissions in Examples from  Hobbes  and  Cotton Alex Neckham Will  of  Newberry Sylvester  the Poet  c  Here we have a Di∣gression upon the Question  Whether Springs are supply'd from the Rains c or from the Sea  Observations on the Quantity of Water thrown out by perennial Springs Sir  Chr Wren  's Invention of the RainBucket to measure the Quantity that falls Computations of what the greatest Ri∣vers throw forth in an Hour Day Year The many Ex∣amples favouring the Origin or Supply of Springs from subtertaneous Communications Then proceeds to the  Rivers  and  Fountains  of this  County  which have yielded any unusual Remarks some running under ground and rising again some throwing up little Bones some never freez∣ing some warmest in the coldest Weather some salt as the  BrinePits  with the manner of  Saltwork  some again are  Vitrioline  some  Petrifying  and some  Sulphureous  Here we are led to the  Medicinal  Waters among these such as are of a  milky Nature  and others  aluminous  Some of Re∣pute for curing the King'sEvil some good for the Eyes and some of noxious Quality as the Coalpit Waters which kill the Fish of those Rivers into which they fall  Chap III  Of the Earths  This begins with the Situa∣tion of the County Nature and Fertility of the Soil K  James  his saying of it for the Firmness of the Highways A Remark upon some Pastures which tinged the Teeth of Cattle of a Golden Colour and upon others which changed the Colour of their Hides A Pit that never held any Water when it filled all others Deductions from Re∣marks upon some Buildings tending to prove the Earth will be quite  level  Of  Earths  that  vegetate  or grow up and  Floating Islands  Of turfing their moorish Grounds and the rotten  Shining  Earth Here we have many curious Instances of luciferous Bodies animate and inanimate Their different  Kinds  of  Earths  and  Clays  and how the  Potters  work the same Of their  Earths  used by Painters in  Colours Sulphurs Bitumen  and  PitCoal  with the Ex∣tent of its  Mines  Remarks on their  Damps  and firing of Mines Of Earthquakes there thought to be caused there∣by Signs for finding of Coal Of working it and keeping it dry  Chap IV  Of Stones  The Causes of their Production Observations on Salt in Stones and such as best endure the Fire Of  Limestone  and the  Pyrites  and the  Bishops Stones  near  Weeford  why so called Then we come to the  Iron  Ore with the melting and working it also the  Copper  Ores and their Works then to the  Lead  Ores where we have an Account of a Leaden Coffin that swam in nine In∣ches Water with the  hydrostatical  Reason for it Hence we come to the  Quarries  and their Stones for Building Grinding and the Mills with an Experiment giving rea∣son to believe the  Loadstone  is to be found at  Rowley Re∣gis  Next of the Rocks Cliffs and Caves which have any thing remarkable their Alabaster and the kind of Marble whereof their  Chimneypieces Tombstones Emery  c are made Also of their  Crowstones  and transparent  Pebbles  Chap V  Of Formed Stones  And first of those resembling heavenly Bodies as the  Selenites  or  Moonstones  more ra∣tionally called  Lapis Specularis  found in this County and the  Asteriae  or  StarStones  of different kind from any yet described whose unaccountable Quality of moving towards one another in Vinegar is here observed to have been known Years since by the learned  Roger Bacon  He speaks next of the  Thunder Stones  as they are commonly called found in those Parts and others representing the Parts of Birds  Crystalline  Stones a kind of  Honeycomb  Stones full of sweetish Liquor many Stones resembling  Sea Fishes  especially of the  testaceous  Kind Of  Gold  and  Silver  grow∣ing like Trees and other  Ores  also into odd Figures Stones also form'd like particular Vegetables as the  Fun∣gites  likewise  Mineral Corals  like Stumps of Trees and the  Vertebrae  of Fishes like Fruits and the Stones of them Animals and their several Parts Buttons Barrels Saddles and some Plants found with  Rings  of Stone Iron and Cop∣per naturally growing about them  Chap VI  Of Plants  Among which none so remarkable for resembling certain Parts of the human Body as the  Fungus Phalloides  or  Phallus Hollandicus  of  Hadr Junius  After several uncommon Observations among the  herba∣ccous  Kind he advances to some undescribed  Shrubs  as the  WhiteBerried Elder  Standard  HoneySuckles  and  Ivy  A  Vine  changing its Fruit from Red to White St  Bertram's Ash  with a narrower Leaf than usual a yellowleav'd  Yew Tree  a bloodspotted  Birch  yellowleav'd  Thorn  and among the Trees unnoted to be of  English  Growth the  Sorbus Pyriformis  and one kind of  Firr  And among the Accidents of Trees some of extraordinary speedy Growth  Oaks  of vast Bulk and extensive Shade more particularly Sir  Harvey Bagot  's  WitchElm  growing at  Field  within Me∣mory which was Foot long Yards round at the Bottom had Load of FireWood broke off in the Fall Load more of FireWood cut from the Top Foot of  Plank  Pair of  Naves c  in short computed to contain Tons of Timber after their Country way of reckoning but according to our Author at least Ton of neat Timber With this is mentioned as what might equal it in Height the Oak which yielded a Plank above Yards long and near one Yard broad of which was made the Table at  Dudley  Castle From this we are led to the tall  Firrs  at  Norbury  one of which was Yards high and thence to what is observable in the  Roots  of Trees as their embracing and lifting up great Stones Trees of dif∣ferent Species uniting at the Roots or in the Trunks and some Trees growing out of the Bodies and Heads of others but above all those found buried under Ground in all Countries are reckoned most unaccountable Here we have an elaborate Dissertation upon those  subterraneous Trees  by some call'd  Mosswood  with the Cause of Mosses sink∣ing of Hills and raising of Valleys Hence we pass to the in∣ternal Notice of what was most uncommon in Trees as the  Cylindraceous  Cavities in an old Crab Tree here described with the Cause leading us to the strange Discovery of Ani∣mals in the Bodies of Trees as  Field Mice  which are su∣perstitiously pegg'd up by the Country People here to make  Nursrow  Trees as they call them to cure Swellings in their Cattle and other Instances of their Superstition in the Wood of the  Quicken  Tree for walking Staves Here end∣ing his Remarks on  Whole Trees  and their  Trunks  with an Observation that the Timber of this County is gene∣rally large and good particularly the Woods in the Park of  John Offley  Esq  whereof Trees might be chosen worth Pounds and of these worth Pounds he proceeds to unusual Accidents in the  Branches Fruits  and  Leaves  of Trees upon which last he accounts for the  Excrescences  by Insects and the  Variegations  or Stripings in  Hollys Maples Ashes  and  Oaks  he met with From thence passes to  Fruit Trees  as the large  spreading Apple Tree  at  Leigh  having borne Strike of Apples in a Year  Pear Trees  blossoming at  Christmas  another that blossom'd and bore twice a Year The  Orange  and  Lemon  growing on one Tree and in one Fruit the Quantity of  Cyder  that might be made in one Parish large Cherry Gardens and great  Variety  of Fruits in the Gardens of  Rowland Oke∣over  Esq  as Sorts of Apples Sorts of Apricots and other Plums  c  with which Enumeration this Chap∣ter ends  Chap VII  Of Brutes  Under which is comprehended  Birds Insects Fishes Reptiles  and  Quadrupeds  and of these only such as are undescribed by others unnoted by  Wil∣lughby  and  Ray  to be  indaginae  of this County or have had extraordinary Accidents attending them And first he be∣gins with  Birds  among these he reckons a kind of Goose∣legg'd  Swans  and the blackbill'd  Goose  with a Voice like a Bittern an undescribed  Loon  or  Ducker  crested horned and bearded the  Eagle  the  Shriek Heathcock  or Black Game  Gorcock  or Red Game the  Martlet  Ground  Mar∣tin Brambling Grossbeak Heron  and great  Loon  but most remarkable is his History of the  Pewits  and their breeding only upon the Estate of Sir  Charles Skrymsher  at the old  PewitPool  in the Parish of  Norbury  and  ShebbenPool  in the Parish of  HighOffley  where they encreased in such abundance that Dozen has been taken at a Dri∣ving which at five Shillings a Dozen the ancient Price comes to twelve Pounds ten Shillings but some Years the Profit of them has amounted to fifty or threescore Pounds and we have here a Representation in Sculpture of  ShebbenPool  with the manner of driving and taking these Birds Next he observes what has been extraordinary in the Co∣lours Limbs Eggs and Time of Production among Birds as  Popinjays Crows  and  Sparrows  that were white Crossbill'd  Ravens  a fourlegg'd  Pewit  and threelegg'd  Goose  with the Opinions of  Fabricius  and Dr  Harvey  that such Deformities arise from  double yolked Eggs  c Next we have Observations upon white yolked  Eggs  and Eggs all Yolk Of  Hens  and  Ducks  that laid at the rate of three Eggs a Day and of Birds hatching in the Winter Then we come to flying Insects as the winged  Glowworm  or  LanthornFly  the white  Earwigg  Of  viviparous  Insects  Spiders  and their Webs with some  aquatic  Insects unde∣scribed which leads to  Fishes  and his Account of the  Burbot  or  Birdbolt  not before or not well described Of Fishes found in unusual Places Of the uncommon Nature of  Eels  that they are  viviparous  travel from one Water to another and the Account of their  equivocal Ge∣neration  How various the Food or  Prey  of Fishes how  voracious  some of them and others restor'd to their Element after they had been swallowed up The unusual  Magnitude  of Fishes particularly a  Carp  weighing Pounds with  Scales  as broad as a HalfCrown  Jacks  a Yard and half long Thus passing from the Water to the Land Animals he begins with the  Toad  and how strangely some have been found excluded from both Elements in the midst of solid Blocks of Stone and in the Bodies of sound Trees Then we have an Account of an undescribed Land  Lizard  a strange toothed  Rabbit  uncommon Accidents in a  Hare  and other Animals breeding their Young and an odd Mix∣ture in the Breed of  Dogs  Of large  Boars  the Reason discuss'd why  Castration  prevents  Horns  in some Animals and enlarges them in others Of uncommon Accidents in Sheep Deer Cows Oxen Horses as to Heading Breeding Superfoetation  c  Of  Hair Balls  found in the Stomachs of such Animals and  Shining Tallow  Concluding with a Description of the true  Hippomanes  or Forehead Flesh of a new foaled Colt so famous among the Ancients in  Philtres  or  LovePotions  and an Account of the Jaw∣bone of an  Elephant  found in this County  Chap VIII  Of Men and Women  Beginning with an Ac∣count of one who was neither Of Men getting Children at Years of Age Of  Longing  in Women and dismem∣dering the  Foetus  like the Object which gave the Fright Some who had all the  Signs  of  Pregnancy  without being with Child others having a Child without the Signs Of Children born with Teeth Monstrous and imperfect Births Of the Persons born in this County who were e∣minent  Churchmen Lawyers  and  Authors  or for their  Valour  by  Land  and  Sea  and for  numerous Offsprings  Re∣markable Customs relating to  Births  as  BorowEnglish  or Descent of Lands to the  Youngest  before the  Eldest  born with the Reason presumed to be that where this Custom remains the Places were anciently liable to the Privilege granted also in  Scotland  by King  Evenus  or  Eugenius  to the  Lords  of  Mannors  that they should have the first Night's Lodging with their  Tenants  Brides so that  eldest  Sons being supposed all  Bastards  and of the Lord's beget∣ting they settled their Lands on the  Youngest  as more likely to be their own But how common this Custom was all over  England  may be seen by the Tax afterwards gathered instead thereof called  Marcheta Mulierum  in  Bracton  Nor was the Privilege of  Lotherwits  or  Lierwit  expounded  in  Fleta  to import the same as  Mulcta Adulteriorum  and remaining here to this day much less lewd or immoral being a Liberty of taking a Compensation for Bastards got or born in the Lordship nay also out of the Lordship for  l    s    d  paid to the  Lords  and further here was an  Oak  in  KnollWood  which had such a superior Privilege of  Fornication  that if a Bastard was sworn to be begot under its Shade neither the  Bishop  nor  Lords  of the  Mannor  them∣selves could take any Cognizance of it After these Births we have some Remarks upon  Christnings  or  Christian Names  how they ran much upon  Ralph  and  Walter  from two famous Earls who lived in the County and how some Families christned their eldest Sons of the same Name for many Generations Having done with the Births of In∣fants he proceeds to remarkable Passages in  Childhood  and  Youth  as the Impostures of  William Perry  the Boy of  Bil∣son  who counterfeited himself bewitched or possessed whereof there is a Pamphlet printed in And this Story brings in other Instances of  imitating Sounds  and  Motions  whereof the  involuntary Imitations  of  Donald Monro  are most strange Next we advance to uncom∣mon Accidents and Qualities in adult Persons and first of Women Some who yielded great Quantities of  Milk  and the medicinal Virtues of Women's Milk One who  slept  Days and Nights and another Days A Man who  fasted  Days and another in  Scotland  or Days to∣gether And here is a Copy from a  Record  in the  Tower  of a  Pardon  granted  Edward  III to  Cicely de Rygeway  who was condemned at  Nottingham  for killing her Hus∣band because she had fasted forty Days without Meat or Drink  c  Of  deaf  Persons understanding People by the Motion of their Lips Of a Lady who had a Pin squeezed out of her Arm which she never could account for yet parallel'd with like Instances Of strange Deliverances from  Murder  and  Hanging  particularly of  Judith de Balsham  who having been hang'd from nine aClock on  Monday  Morning till Sunrising on  Tuesday  according to the Sen∣tence passed yet lived after it and had a Pardon thereupon granted th  Hen  III which is here recited And of a  Swiss  who was hanged times yet could not by that kind of Execution be put to death Next we come to Men eminent for their extraordinary  Strength  excessive  Stature  and  Pious Works  others who had their want of  Sight  wonderfully supply'd by the Perfection of their other  Senses strange Instances of  Longing  in Men as well as Women and other uncommon Distempers Of Men that never  spit  The strange Force of  Custom  in some  Fools  especially one who being removed from a Place where he had heard a Clock constantly strike would repeat the Strokes punctually every Hour when he heard it not and of the  Artificial  learn'd to become a  Natural  Clock as Dr  Willis  has related Here is another Instance of a  Fool  whose strange Sagacity exceeded the other telling not only the Changes of the Moon Times of Eclipses and when  Easter  and  Whitsuntide  fell or any other  moveable  Feast but at what time they had or should fall at any dis∣tance of Years which could receive no Help from the  Force  of  Custom  From the Imperfections of Men we have a Transition to their  Vices  which brings in the dread∣ful Judgment upon  John Duncalf  who having stole a Bible had his Hands rotted off according to his Wish if that Theft were true from the  Narrative  of this Judgment pub∣lished by Mr  Ja Illingworth  and Mr  Newey  This is followed with some wonderful Escapes from  Death  in this County particularly that of King  Charles  II after the Bat∣tle of  Worcester  who found an  Asylum  at  Bentley  and afterwards conferred several Honours on Col  John Lane  as the  Letters Patent  here exemplified concerning the same do testify Here is likewise an Account of the Preservation of his Followers and by whose means his Majesty's  George  came safe again to his Hands From Men solitarily con∣sidered we proceed to some Remarks upon them jointly in Examples of Men extremely alike or  resembling  each other particularly Dr  Hen Fairfax  and his Brother Of Bishops twice married Remarks on many Families of one Name and marrying among themselves Of some odd Customs as at  Guosall  where the Civil Law Judge deter∣mines according to a Jury  Moseley  's  Dolepenny  at  Wal∣shall  The Society of  FreeMasons  in the  Moorlands  of this County with some curious Remarks thereon par∣ticularly on a fabulous MS  History  of the said  Craft  their Lodges and Rules with the Notice of an Act  Henry  VI abolishing this Society and adjudging the holding of their Congregations to be Felony The Custom at  Brewood  c of adorning their Walls with Boughs and Flowers Many Examples of extream  old Age  many aged Persons living together five and six Generations at a time Exam∣ples of several unaccountable  Warnings  of Death in some  Families by divers kinds of Noise Remarks on the frontal  Sutures  in some  Skulls  and of some large human Bones which with an Omission or two in the Articles of  valiant  Men and those famous in the  Law  finishes this Chapter  Chap IX  Of Arts  These are treated of after his former Method first of such as relate to the  Heavens  and  Air  next of  Fire  and  Waterworks  thirdly tending to the Im∣provement of  Earths Stones  or  Plants  and lastly re∣specting  Men  or  Women  To this purpose he begins with an Account of a new Sort of  Dyals  and a  Dyal Quadrant  with an Experiment proving the Force of the Rarefaction of  Air  The  Arts  relating to  Fire  are those of burning  Turf Earth  c for the fertilizing of Lands and for cer∣tain  Ironworks  at the Anvil and Forge particularly of the Difficulty and Ingenuity of making Fryingpans and that there were but two Masters of this Craft in the Kingdom An improved Way of burning  Tiles  Prince  Rupert  's Dex∣terity in shooting with  FireArms  exemplified in the two famous Shots he made successively thro' the Weathercock of St  Mary  's ChurchSteeple at  Stafford  with a screw'd Horseman's Pistol at threescore Yards distance before King  Charles  I Among the  Waterworks  we have some Account of remarkable  Mills  and  Milldams  of Brewing and Fining of  Ale  and in the PleasureGardens of  Foun∣tains Canals  c Of Arts relating to the  Earth  we have here those of the  Agriculture  used in this County and of those concerning  Stones  what is most observable in Ar∣chitecture both publick and private with some copious Remarks upon the Building of  Churches  especially  East  and  West  Next of the  Bridge  at  Burton  upon  Trent  and after that of the Hardening and Softning of  Iron  for the mak∣ing of several kinds of the said Hard Ware with many In∣stances of curious Improvements therein and the ways used to keep them from Rust Then follow some Arts relating to  Plants  as the improving of  Ropes  made with  Hemp  and  Rushes  preserving of  Beer  with  Heath  instead of  Hops  and making Malt of  Oats  After these the Arts re∣lating to  Shrubs  and  Trees  as to the sowing of  Acorns  making  Furze  Hedges planting of  Vines  forming of  Topiary  Works Arbors and other like Curiosities in Gardens Parks and Groves with the managing of their  Woods  as to Brushing Fencing Barking Felling  c  and the Excellency of some  Joyners  and  Turners  Work thereon also their Ma∣nagement of  FruitTrees  Thus we come to their Arts  concerning Animals beginning with Bees and Beehives An Instrument to match  Game Cocks  Device to prevent  Hogs  from  rooting  and to cure some Distempers in Cattle a new invented  Bridle  or  Gag  for  scolding Women  and a  Sledge  for Smiths Improved  Barrels  for Drink in  Cookery  potted  Otters  tasting like  Venison  and to punish  Misde∣meanors  a Pair of  FingerStocks  Lastly some odd kind of Pictures upon an indented Board which beheld directly appear confused but obliquely the Pictures of a King and Queen also some curious Cutwork in Paper with Scis∣sars of Col  J Lane  's Tomb Trophies Inscription  c  And Part of a  Greek  Chapter which laid on a black Ground was as legible as the same in a printed Testament  Chap X  Of Antiquities  And these not so much of Persons or Actions as of  Things  such as are remote from the present Age whether found under Ground or whereof there yet remain any Footsteps above it as ancient  Me∣dals Ways Lows Pavements Urns Monuments  of Stone  Fortifications  c whether of the ancient  Britains Ro∣mans Saxons Danes  or  Normans  Beginning with the Au∣thor's Reasons why the original Inhabitants of this County might be  Iceni  and the notable  Remains  of some ancient  British  City near  Wrottesley  of great Extant being about three or four Miles round with some Ruins of  Fortifi∣cations  presumed also to be theirs Of their  Arrow Heads  made of  Flints  found here Other Antiquities also of  Bri∣tish  Origin and particularly the Place where  Litchfield  now is so called from the  dead Bodies  of St  Amphabale  's Com∣panions who were martyr'd there Of  Roman  Antiqui∣ties the most considerable in these Parts are their  publick Ways  which here with some other of their Antiquities also are copiously treated of The  Saxon  and  Danish  Antiqui∣ties are still more largely discuss'd in relation to the build∣ing or destroying of several Towns Fortifications  c  in the County Here speaking of the  Customs  and  Utensils  of the  Danes  which obtained among these People we have a large Account and Sculpture of the  Staffordshire Cloggs  or little square Logs of Wood which by the Notches and Incisions upon them supplied the Use of  Almanacks  with many Remarks upon the Symbols thereon and the Com∣putations relating thereto ending as to this  Danish  Part with the Account of the famous Lady  Godiva  who rode through  Coventry  naked to obtain many Privileges for the Inhabitants of her Husband  Leofric  Earl of  Mercia  she dying at his Village of  Bromleyg  in this County accord∣ing  to  Knyghton  tho' buried at  Coventry  To these are added some old Customs whose Originals being obscure might commence as high as those Times such as the Ser∣vice of the Lord of  Essington  to the Lord of  Hilton  round whose HallFire he was to drive a Goose every NewYear'sDay three times  c  while  Jack of Hilton  a whim∣sical kind of  Aeolipile  being a little brazen Image in an im∣pudent Posture filled with Water is blowing the Coals Their merry Custom of the  HobbeyHorse Dance  c at  Abbots Bromley  had a good useful End in it but the Cus∣tom at  Tutbury  for the King of the  Minstrells  to arrest all the Musicians in the said Franchise who refused to do the yearly Services according to the Charter of  John  of  Gaunt  for which they had a Bull given by the Prior of  Tutbury  amidst all the Harmony thereof seems to have been at∣tended with much Discord which produced an Alteration according to the modern Ceremonies used in these their musical Meetings which yet are not void of Tumult and Mischief That other Custom at  Tutbury  of finding a  Flitch of Bacon  for every married Man who took the Oath a Year and a Day after his Marriage That he had never wished to change his Wife but would have taken her be∣fore all other Women had she been single whereby Sir  Philip de Somervile  held  Whichnovre  and other Manors had a good Encouragement in it to the making of mature Elections and being contented with those they made and was parallel'd by that Custom also instituted at the Priory of  Dunmow  in  Essex  by the Lord  Robert Fitzwalter temp Hen  III which Ceremony is also here recited from the History of that Baron printed Then follows an Ac∣count of some other Antiquities as the Donation of  Heyley  Castle to  Hen de Aldithleg  and the Advowson of  Penck∣ridge  Church to the Archbishops of  Dublin  by King  John  which with the founding of some other old Structures also the Account of an Entrenchment anciently the Seat of the  Cockains  a monumental Stone in Memory of the Death of  James  Lord  Audley  and the mention of a few more emi∣nent Persons omitted in their proper Place concludes this elaborate and curious History of  Staffordshire  and how grateful soever our Au  hor's Acknowledgments throughout the same appear for his Encouragement therein he yet ends with informing us he is  "pretty fully resolved never to publish any more of these Histories tho' I think says he I was never so fit as now unless commanded by a Power that I must not resist"  To the Work he has joined  a useful  Index  also his  Proposals  for  Subscription  which are very reasonable no more than a Penny  per Sheet  a Penny each  Plate  and the  Map  Sixpence which for each Copy he guesses will amount to about ten or twelve Shillings and the whole ends with a  List  of the said Subscribers  XXX  A  Collection  of ROYAL GRANTS  from the beginning of King  HENRY VIII  to the latter end of King  WILLIAM III Extracted from the  Patent Rolls  and other  authentic  In∣struments in the  Offices  of  Record  MS Large  Folio  Pages  THIS Collection made about the Beginning of the Reign of our late Queen  Anne  by a Gentleman lately dead as we have some Reason to

King  Henry  VIII from the  first  to the  thirtieth  Year of his Reign extending to Page which is followed with a long Recital in  Latin  of many other  Grants  in the same Period of  Abbey Lands  c

made with the particular  Times  when and the  Places  where they lay to what  Abbeys Priories  c they belonged for what  Con∣sideration  and by what  Rents  or  Rights  they were held and into what

Eminent  AN∣TIQUARIES  upon several Heads in our  ENGLISH ANTI∣QUITIES and now first publish'd by THOMAS HEARNE M A  Oxford    vo  Pages besides a long Preface  THE  Publisher  of these  Discourses  shews us in his  Pre∣face  that Experience and Practice are better helps in the Study of  Antiquities  than General Rules yet that these are to be regarded and better Accounts of our Antiquities to be given Next he commends the  Baroccian  Collection of  Greek  MSS and Dr  Langbain  's noble Design of publish∣ing divers Volumes of Fragments which requir'd Assist∣ance and that the Clergy ought to have better Provision to enable them for such Public Services That the  Polyglott  Bible is a noble Instance of what shou'd be expected from  Joint Labours  requisite also in our own  History  and  Anti∣quities  That such  Societies  ought to have  stated Meetings  and  write  upon  intricate Subjects  as these  Antiquaries  did Further of the said  Society  and this Collection and how they were

Win∣ton  which was first printed in  The End of Number  III  XXXII  The Book of the  ORDRE  of  CHYVALRY  or  KNYGHTHODE  translated out of the Frensshe and imprinted by  William Caxton  Quarto without Date  THIS thin Volume of about one hundred Pages is perhaps one of the scarcest Books now remaining of that our first Printer seeing it has so little occurred to those who have attempted to give us any Catalogues of his Pub∣lications Tho' no Date when it was printed is express'd yet may it be guessed at within a Year over or under by sup∣posing it in from the short Reign of that Prince to whom it is inscribed at the End as will presently appear It is printed with large  initial  Letters at the Beginning of the Chapters with only one Sort of  Points  which are ob∣lique or leaning Dashes some double or  united Types  as in his other Books which we have hitherto observed also with  Signatures  but no  Catchwords  at the Bottom of the Leaves nor any  Numbers  on them at Top And is di∣vided into  eight Chapters  The  first  shews how a Knight who was a Hermit be∣stowed this Rule or Order of Chivalry upon a Squire The  second  treats of the Beginning of Chivalry or Knighthood The  third  of the Office of Chivalry  Fourth  Of the Examination that ought to be made to the  Esquyer  when he will enter into the Order of Chivalry  Fifth  In what manner the Squire ought to receive Chivalry  Sixth  Of the  Sygnefyaunce  of the Arms belonging to a Knight  Seventh  Of the Customs that appertain to a Knight And  eight  Of the Honours that ought to be done to a Knight By all which it will appear how different the Honour the Pro∣fession the Qualifications required in Knights anciently were from those for which they have been created in lat∣ter Times  At the End we have the Printer's Rehearsal in these Words  "Here endeth the Book of  the Ordre of Chyvalry  whiche Book is translated oute of  Frensshe  in to  Eng∣lysshe  at a Requeste of a gentyl and noble Esquyer by  me

written by him in the  English  Tonge Printed at  London  at the Costes of  John Cawod John Waly  and  Richard Tottell  Anno  Fol Pages besides Tables  c  THO' Sir  Thomas More  suffer'd Death for maintaining the Supremacy of the Pope over that of his Sovereign as may be read in these  Works  and in the many Accounts of his  Life  set forth by the  Roman  Catholics who have much magnified him for his said Writings and Sufferings yet are there many things in this Collection of his  English  Works observable to all Readers who are even not attach'd to his own Persuasion as it is one of the most copious Ex∣emplars we have in Print of the best  English  Stile in those Days and contains some curious Pieces or Parcels of  Civil  and many of  Ecclesiastical  History relating to the Times of our  Reformation  and overlooking the superstitious Adhe∣rence to his Cause with some sophistical Arguments ne∣cessary to support it is fraught with many Testimonies of virtuous Learning fine Genius and good Morals for the universal Conduct of Life  The Book was collected together and published from the Author's printed Copies and Manuscripts by his Nephew  William Rastell  Serjeant at Law and dedicated to Queen  Mary  that it might forward her Majesty's  most  Godly  Puspose in purging this her Realm of all wicked Heresies  After the Table of Contents and a tolerable good In∣dex the Collection commences with some Pieces of our Author's Poetry which he wrote for his Diversion in his younger Days As the Merry  Jest  how a  Serjeant  would learn to play the  Frier  containing some good Reproofs of those who act out of their Sphere Then follow his  Verses  to explain the  Images  in some  Pageants  which he devised in his Father's House describing the several Stages and Consequents of Life After this we have his rueful  La∣mentation of the Death of Queen Elizabeth  Wife of King  Henry  VII in  Feb  Next come his Prefatory Verses before the  Book of Fortune  These Verses make about four  Sheets Hence we pass to his Works in Prose beginning with  the Life of John Picus Earl of Mirandula an Ita∣lian Nobleman  of great Virtue and Learning who died in aged with several of his Letters and his Ver∣ses translated from the  Latin  and dedicated to his beloved Sister  Joyeuce Leigh  After this we have  the History of King Richard  III written by our Author when he was one of the Under Sheriffs of  London  about the Year but unfinished and published before in the  Chronicles  of  Harding  and  Hall  tho' very corruptly and much varying from his own Copy whence this is printed The next is a long Treatise  on the four last Things  Death Dome Pain and Joy with several Chapters on Pride Envy Wrath Covetousness Gluttony and Slouth composed after he was knighted of the Privy Council to King  Henry  VIII and UnderTreasurer of  England  about the Year but unfinish'd and we presume never before printed but that which succeeds it was as we are informed the Year after it was written entitled A  Dialogue  of Sir  T More  then Chancellor of the Dutchy of  Lancaster  wherein is treated  of the Veneration and Worship of Images  and  Reliques  praying to  Saints  and going on  Pilgrimage  with many things touching the Sects of  Luther  and  Tyndale  begun by the one in  Saxony  and labour'd to be brought by the other into  England  made in the Year This is a large Trea∣tise in four Books divided into many Chapters and illus∣trated with many pleasant Examples Tales  c  with which he had a Memory plentifully furnished and a Ta∣lent happily constituted to apply them To some who made Objection thereat we find his Answer was  "That for a Layman to tell his Mind merrily might sometimes better become him than seriously and solemnly to preach"  His next Treatise is  The Supplication of Souls  written against a famous little Tract call'd  The Supplication of Beggars  written by  Simon Fish  of  Gray'sInn  which was very Instrumental to the Reformation and is reprinted in  Fox  To that follows  The Confutation of Tyndale's An∣swer  to the  Dialogue  aforesaid made by our Au∣thor In the Preface hereof we have a large Account of many late Books and their Authors whom Sir  Thomas  calls  Heretics  Then we come to  Tyndale  's Preface divided with our Author's Answers to the several Particulars alter∣nately which ends the  first  Book but the  first Part  of the Work contains Books The  second Part  written  after he had given over his Chancellor's Office begins at the fourth Book It contains  Tyndale  's  Defence  for his  Trans∣lation  of the  Testament  with our Author's  Answers  to the several Parts interfering as before and herein having consider'd  Tyndale  's Church to the End of the  seventh  Book we come in the  eight  to our Author's Confutation of  Barnes  his Church in the same manner The  ninth  Book is a Summary of the rest was not printed before and appears at the End to have been left unfinished This Work is succeeded by  a Letter  of our Author written at  Chelchith  or  Chelsea  in  against the little Book of John Frith upon the Sacrament  and both concluded with a long  Apology  written and published also the same Year in Answer to the Objections which were made more es∣pecially to these his last Writings against his said three An∣tagonists These Pieces of his producing a large Treatise against him call'd  Salem and Bizance  he writ the same Year his  Debellacion of Salem and Bizance  The same Year he wrote his  Answer to the first Part of the Poisoned Book which a nameless Heretic named the Supper of the Lord  His Postscript to this Treatise ends with this Allu∣sion  "Of all my Adversaries could I never hitherto find any one but when he catcheth once a Fall as each of them hath caught full many there lyeth he still tumb∣ling and toltring in Mire and neither Spur nor Bridle can one Inch prevail but as tho' they were not fall'n in a Puddle of Dirt but rubbed and laid in Litter under the Manger at their Ease they whine and they bite and they kick and they spurn at him that would help them up"  His next Performance is entitled  A Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation  made by an  Hungarian  in  La∣tin  and translated out of  Latin  into  French  and out of  French  into  English  in when he was Prisoner in the  Tower  of  London  And this is followed with  a Treatise to receive the Blessed Body of our Lord sacramentally and ver∣tually both  written in the same Year and Place The next is a  Treatise Historical containing the bitter Passion of our Saviour Christ after the Course and Order of the four Evangelists  with an Exposition upon their Words taken mostly out of the Sayings of sundry good old holy Doctors  c  This copious Treatise was also written in the same Year and Place aforesaid 'tis mostly taken from  John Gerson's Monatesseron  but is unfinished the Author now being denied the Use of Books Pens Ink and Paper  Yet here follows  His Godly Instructions Meditations and Prayers  in  Latin  and  English  written with a Coal both before and after his Condemnation which was on  Thurs∣day  the first of  July    Anno    Hen  VIII and he was  beheaded  on  TowerHill  the  Tuesday  following The rest of the Volume consists of his  Letters  c written at sundry times on divers Occasions beginning with his Letter from the Court at  Woodstock  to his Wife the Lady  Alice  at  Chelsea  in the Year before he was Lord Chancel∣lor containing Consolations to her for the Loss she had there by Fire Next we have his Epitaph written by him∣self in  Latin  in soon after he had laid down his Chan∣cellor's Office which he caused to be inscribed upon his Tomb which he had erected in  Chelsea  Church while he was Lord Chancellor with a Translation of it Then follow four Letters which he wrote after he had given over the Office of Chancellor and before he was imprison'd  viz  Three to Mr  Tho Cromwell  of the King's Privy Coun∣cil and one to King  Henry  VIII all in the Year Next we have his Letters  c  wrote while he was Pri∣soner in the  Tower  beginning with his Letter to his eldest Daughter Mrs  Margaret Roper  upon his refusing the Oath Another to his said Daughter written with a Coal His  Answer  to a Letter of hers which seemingly persuaded him to take the Oath that she might get the Liberty she did obtain of Access to him Her Answer thereunto His Letter to all his Friends written with a Coal with two Stanza's upon Fortune Lady  Alice Alington  's Letter to Mrs  Margaret Roper  A long Answer by her or her Fa∣ther to the same His two Letters to Doctor  Nicholas Wilson  also Prisoner in the  Tower  His Daughter  Roper  's Answer to a Letter of his when he was shut up close Prisoner with his Answers both to the same and another she had sent him His Letter to Mr  Leder  a virtuous Priest the same Year Two more of his Letters to his Daughter in His  Latin  Epistle to Mr  An∣thony Bonuyse  Merchant of  Luca  in  London  his old Friend written with a Coal the same Year with the Translation His last Letter was to his Daughter  Roper  the Day before his Death containing his Blessing to and desires to be re∣commended to the Prayers of her and his other Friends and Relations  XXXIV  The  BREVIARY OF BRYTAYNE c  contayning a learned Discourse of the Variable State c thereof under di∣verse as well natural as forren  Princes  With the  Geographical Description  of the same such as neither by elder nor later Writers the like hath been set forth be∣fore Written in  Latin  by  HUMFREY LHUYD  of  Den∣bigh  a  Cambre Britayne  and lately  englished by THO∣MAS TWYNE  Gent  Octavo Leaves  THIS muchcommended Book is dedicated to  Edward de Vere  Earl of  Oxenford  Lord Great Chamberlayne of  England  by the  Translator  who tells his Lordship at this time but in the Flower of his Age  "that hereon when your Honour shall be at leisure to look bestowing such Regard as you are accustom'd to do on Books of  Geography Histories  and other good Learning wherein I am privy your Honour taketh singular Delight I doubt not but you shall have cause to judge your Time very well applied And so much the rather for that in the Study of Geography it is expedient first to know exactly the Situation of our own home where we abide before that we shall be able to judge how other Countries do lie unto us which are far distant from us besides that it were a foul Shame to be inquisitive of the State of  Foreign  Lands and to be igno∣rant of our  own  "  Then follows the Translator's  Preface  in which he ac∣knowleges the Assistance of Dr  Yale  for the Translation of some Names especially in the  British  Tongue and the Faultiness of the  Latin  Copy which was printed at  Cologne  He also apologizes for his Translation of the Title as above it being called by the Author  Commentarioli Britannicae Descriptionis Fragmentum  that is literally  A Fragment of a little Treatise of the Description of Britain  which he thinks not much beside the Meaning of the Title he hath given it Next we have other Commendations in Verse namely by  T Brown  Prebend of  Westminster Ed Grant  Schoolmaster of  Westminster Lodowick Lhuyd  c Lastly  concludes his Preface with a Commendation of the Author which for Brevity we refer to having a Character more Modern here to subjoin  In the Copy of this Book now before us which had been the late Mr  Hearne  's of  Oxford  he has written as follows  "This is a very rare Book and the Translation is done admi∣rably well and therefore the Encomiastick Verses are deser∣vedly put before it I have seen a very imperfect and misera∣bly shatter'd one go at a considerable Price in an Auction"  Nor is the Translator unattend∣ed with Verses by his Brothers  Laurence  and  John Twyn  After an Alphabetical Table we have the Author's  Epistle  to  Abraham Ortelius  of  Antwerp  wherein we observe he was now suffering under a dangerous Fever Yet that he had here sent him his Description of  Wales  and of  England  with the ancient Names and another  England  besides cer∣tain Fragments written with his own Hand probably for his great Book of  Geography  This Epistle is dated from  Denbigh Aug  and subscrib'd yours both living and dying  H Lhuyd  After a Table of near seventy Authors used in this little Work our learned Antiquary begins it with his Notice of the Promise he had made to his Correspondent aforesaid of sending him the Geographical Description of  Britain  with the most ancient Names as well  Latin  as  British  wherein because he finds he must disagree from the Opinions of others he has thought it expedient first in a few Words to disclose the Effect of his Purpose and by what Arguments and Authorities he is moved to change or ascribe to others the Names of some Countries Towns Rivers and other Places But before he takes this in hand enters upon some Explana∣tion of the  British Tongue  touching the signification of the Letters and manner of pronouncing the same The Igno∣rance of which Tongue having driven many notable Men to such shifts that endeavouring to wind themselves out of one they have fallen into many After this he begins with the  Etymologies  of  Britain  shews their Errors who have darken'd all the Names of Places and Men with those of  Latin  De∣rivation whereof  Robert Coenalis  is particularly arraign'd so proceeds to confirm Sir  Thomas Eliot  's Observation out of an old Manuscript that  Britain  was anciently written  Prytannia  as if it were derived from  Pryd  signifying Come∣liness or  Beauty  and  Cain  or  White  with the first Letter sunk for smoothness in Conjunction After this he takes  occasion to chastise  Polydore Virgil  the  Italian  and  Hector Boethius  the  Scot  whereof the first in his  History of Britain  mainly sought not only to obscure the Glory of the  British  Name but also to defame the  Britains  themselves with scandalous Lyes and the other in attempting to raise the  Scots  out of Darkness attributes whatever he finds the  Ro∣mans  or  Britains  have done worthy of Commendation in this Island all to his Countrymen Yet does he also believe that  Brutus  came into  Britain  with his  Trojans  and took upon him the Government thereof whence they might also be called  Britains  Then he proceeds to the  Division  of  Britain  into  Lhoegria Albania  and  Cambria  so to the En∣trance of the  Saxons  and by whom the Country was called  England  and the People  Saison  But now returning to treat more particularly of  Lhoegr  or  England  he begins first with  Kent  and having given an Account of the ancient Names of Places in this and other Counties to  fol  where having also reproved  Sleydan  's partial Abridgment of  Froissart  and ended with the Descent of the  Stuarts  he begins as in a  Second Part  with these Words  "Now that we have wander'd over all  England  called  Lhoegr  let us next in Or∣der proceed to the second Region of  Britain  which of our Countrymen is called  Albania  of the Inhabitants  Scotland  "  Here he observes That there was never any Writer of Name that made mention either of  Scots  or  Redshanks  be∣fore  Vespasian  's Time about the Year of our Lord's Incar∣nation when  Merrigus  or  Arviragus  reigned in  Britain  And that they cou'd not be called by the  Romans Phichtiani  for painting their Bodies since they were called by that Name before they were ever known to the  Latins  and were the  Britains  whom  Caesar  and others report to have painted themselves  blue  with the Herb  Woad  that they might appear more terrible to their Enemies Then having given us the Original of the  Scots  and  Redshanks  and sharply corrected  Boethius  for his many Falsities he proceeds in the like Manner as he had done of  England  briefly to describe or explain the Names of several principal Places in  Albania  or  Scotland  and the circumjacent Islands so passes to the third Part con∣cerning  Wales  upon which our Author is most copious as well in describing the Manners of the People and the Cha∣racters of some of their most ancient Worthies as the an∣cient Names of the Places Interspersed with many learned Authorities curious Observations and critical Remarks Of which we shall mention only his Reproof of the  Golden  Number  his Description of  Wenefride  's Well with other Censures again of  P Virgil  and  William Petit  the Monk and lastly of  Gildas  for his hard Character of the  Britains  as if he was to be regarded merely as a Preacher  "whose Cus∣tom is very sharply to inveigh against the Faults of their Hearers Wherefore if we seek Authorities out of Sermons as  Polydore  hath done what Parish what Town what Nation or Kingdom may escape Infamy What hath  Bernard  written of the  Romans  Thus surely terming them impious unfaithful seditious dishonest traiterous great Speakers but little Doers These Things are by  Divines  spoken in the Pulpit according unto their Man∣ner that the like Faults may be amended and the Life reformed not that the  Romans  or  Britains  were such in∣deed Neither is there any Man unless he be a shame∣less Sycophant that lyeth in wait for all Occasions to dis∣praise and accuse which will go about by wresting of Sentences forth of the Sermons of Preachers slanderous∣ly to tax and infamously to note any whole Covent Shire City or People Wherefore let such idle and illdisposed Slanderers leave off and suffer the true Re∣nown of  Britain  to appear to the World Neither judge me good Reader of too sharp a Tongue seeing so God help me neither Envy of any Foreign Name neither Thirst of Vainglory neither Hatred of any Nation but alone the Love of my Country which is evil spoken of undeservedly and desire to set forth the Truth have provoked me to write thus much"  Then follows a short and modest Conclusion after which the whole is ended with certain  Welch  or rather true  British  Words converted into  Latin  by the Author and now translated into  English  XXXV  A Treatise of the  CORRUPTION  of  SCRIPTURE COUN∣CILS  and  FATHERS  by the  Prelates Pastors  and  Pillars  of the  CHURCH  of  ROME  for maintenance of  Popery  and  Irreligion  By  THOMAS JAMES  Student in Divini∣ty and Chief Keeper of the  Public Library  in  OXFORD  c With a sufficient  Answer  unto  JAMES GRETSER  and  ANTONIE POSSEVINE Jesuits and the unknown Author of  The Grounds of the Old Religion and the New  Divi∣ded into V Parts Lond Quarto  THE Learned Author of this Work in his Dedication to  George Abbot  Archbishop of  Canterbury  tells him  "he has written this Book in  English  for the Benefit of his poor seduced Countrymen who are persuaded by the Priests and Jesuits that there is no such Matter and that their Books are freest from Corruption and Minds from Falshood that Protestants are guilty of this Crime and sundry others But as St  Austen  observed of  Hereticks  that they were shameless and impudent without Fore∣heads not caring what they said So it is with the  Papists  they do not only impudently deny but wickedly translate the Crime from themselves unto others For if forging false  Treatises  or Corruption of the True changing of  Scriptures  or altering of Men's Words contrary to their Meaning be certain Notes of Heresy how heretical then must the  Church  of  Rome  be wherein this  Doctrine of Cor∣ruption  is both openly  taught  and  profess'd  As their  Indices Expurgatorii  the  Printing  of the  Fathers  Works at  Rome  and the Evidence of the Fact doth plainly declare All which is plainly shewed in this small Treatise and whatsoever else doth tend thereunto"  Then he observes how his said Patron the Archbishop had long since in his Book against  Hill  begun to discover this devilish Policy of the common Adversary and his Grace's Example has en∣couraged him to proceed therein and embolden'd him to consecrate his Labours with himself wholly at his Grace's Disposition  After this Address which gives in this Part we have here extracted a Glimpse of the Contents of the Work before us we have an ample  Advertisement to the Christian Rea∣der  wherein he tells him that  "having fully travelled this vast Wilderness of Sin I have thought it my Duty to leave certain  LandMarks  behind me for their Direction which shall come hereafter"  The whole Book is resol∣ved into  five Parts  The  First  shews  The Bastardy of the False Fathers  and in this Part these few Things are to be no∣ted That there are several Treatises here distinctly produced which are shrewdly suspected if not plainly con∣victed of Forgery by the  Papists  themselves That our Author follows herein the Judgment of their most esteemed Wri∣ters such as  Bellarmine  and  Baronius Possevin  and  Gretser Sextus Senensis Angelus Roccha Pamelius  and sundry others sometimes tho' seldom citing  Erasmus  or following his Cen∣sure because the  Papists  say he was an  Apostate  tho' he defend∣ed the Religion then openly maintain'd against  Oecolampadi∣us Melancthon Martin Luther  and others was accounted in the bosom of the Church and saluted by the Name of Son by  Adrian  VI and  Leo  X And however he was accused for a  Lutheran  seeing his Apology satisfied the Pope in his Life∣time why should the  Papists  traduce him being dead Tho' he were in Heart and Profession a  Papist  God made him write against the Abuses of Popery rather than against the Religion itself as himself says But leaving him let them consider the rest who were inflexible  Papists  and see here how the best of them are driven to censure these Treatises yet enforced to make use of them abusing the simple Reader by the frequent Citation of  Clement Cyprian Ambrose Au∣gustine Hierome  and the rest when no one Scrip of their Writings is alledg'd yet  Cocceius  their Master has been bold to set down the Age when every one of these Fathers lived to those bastard Treatises which themselves never saw Our Author begins his said  Catalogue  in this first Part with  Ab∣dias  who lived in the Time of St  Paul  and ends it with  Isodore  who flourish'd not long after St  Gregory  yet in this Part he comprises not all the Treatises of the Fathers who lived within the Six Hundred Years condemned by  Papists  nor many more detected by the  Protestants  but only those he finds cited by the  Papists  in their Books of Controversy especially when they are alledg'd to gain Credit with the simple People which they well might do since some Learn∣ed Men here named have been deceived to cite thefe For∣geries  as the Works of the Fathers who lived before  Lu∣ther  's Time so they cou'd not be forged by  Protestants  who according to the Opinion of the  Papists  derive their Origin from him And as to their being cited sometimes by learn∣ed  Protestants  also 'tis but reasonable as one side has used them for their Convenience that they shou'd be as free for the other After this  Catalogue  which comprehends Pages we have a List of the  Names  of the  Author  's whose  Books  are cited and a brief  Table  wherein is declared the  Use  that  Papists  make of these  Bastard Treatises  With an∣other  Table  shewing who they were  written by  or  ascribed to  and the  Characters  of them Thus we come to  Part II  Of the Corruption of the True Fathers  wherein is the greater Danger because it may spread farther before espied And here our Author takes the Word  Fathers  in a large Sense extending it as far as  Gregory de Valentia  does unto the best learned of all Ages His Observations are ta∣ken from the most learned  Protestants  and particularly his chief Encourager the learned Dr  Bilson  Bishop of  Win∣chester  Further this Part contains Proofs of corrupted Places in these Ecclesiastical Writers In the th Proof there is a Story rehearsed by our Author of Bishop  Jewel  who citing St  Gregory  's  Epistles  in a Visitation Sermon at  Abingdon  in  Berkshire  was defamed for corrupting his Au∣thor's Sense which caused all the MS of that Father to be search'd whereby it was found that the  Popish  Editions on∣ly were corrupted that the Bishop had quoted the genuine Sense and that those who charged such Corruptions upon him were themselves most guilty of them Our Author concludes this Part with his Wishes for a  Protestant  Edi∣tion of the Councils and observes that Dr  Ward  Master of  SidneySussex  College in  Cambridge  had bestowed many Years Pains in this way and that his Endeavours wou'd tend to excellent Purposes if he might be prevail'd on to publish them but if any Thing keep him back it is an humble Conceit he has ever had to think himself so much the less able the more sufficient others esteem him This Part is comprised in Pages and has in another Page The  Names  added of the  Authors  and  Pages  corrupted  Part III  The Variety and Contrariety of the  Popish  Bi∣bles commonly called the  Vulgar  Bibles in  Latin Our Au∣thor's Motives for publishing this Part were first because it is a Matter of Faith to appoint what is Scripture and what not to shew that the Pope may err in Matters of Faith  Se∣condly  Because  Papists  object to us our different Translations of the Bible to shew their own gross Errors and Absurdities in setting forth their two  Hierome  Bibles authoriz'd by two Popes within two Years  Thirdly  To vindicate his  Bellum Papale  wrote against those two discording Editions from some Objections to the same lately publish'd by  James Gretser  In this Part it further appears These Bibles were set forth by Pope  Sixtus  in and Pope  Clement  And what Sentences or Words were  added  by Pope  Cle∣ment  which were not in the Edition of  Sixtus  Also the Sentences or Words  left out  by  Clement  which were in the Bibles of  Sixtus  with the  Contradictions  of one against the other Errors in  Numerical  Computations Transposition of  Names  and other Alterations of the Sense To which follows An  Apology  or Defence of the  Bellum Papale  pub∣lish'd by our Author against those Bibles to In which he tells us how he came to engage himself against those Editions recites the pompous Inscription set up in the  Vatican  in Honour of  Sixtus  upon his said Publication with the Apologies of some Jesuits for the Errors therein as  Baldwin  Dr  Norrice  and Dr  Bishop  also some Answers to  Gretser  's Allegations against our Author With an Account of  Arias Montanus  's  Apology  for his Integrity in setting forth the King's Bibles containing the whole History of his Trou∣bles in the Progress of that costly Work the Copy of which was found at the Sack of  Cadiz  and by Dr  Rives  reposited in the Library at  Oxford  this with a rehearsal of some Sen∣tences that are yet found uncorrected or rather added un∣warrantably to the Vulgar Bible also some further Answers to his Antagonist and a Character of him concludes this Part in Pages  Part IV  Of their condemning the Fathers  For tho' the  Papists  do much boast of their Fathers and vulgarly seem to value their Writings yet it is found that none are more injurious to their Works or their Worth  "using them as Mer∣chants do their casting Counters sometimes they stand for Pounds sometimes for Shillings sometimes for Pence sometimes for nothing according as they be next and readiest at Hand to make up their Accounts"  In this Part our Author acknowledges himself much indebted to the Second Part of the Dean of  Winchester  's Apology and to  Sam Huberus  in his  AntiBellarminus  And having proved these Assertions he proceeds to lay open the Mystery and Abuses of the  Indices Expurgatorii  shews you the Original  Nature Use and Corruption of this  Inquisition  the Offi∣cers Inquisitors Commissaries and Public Notaries con∣cerned in these  Indices of Books to be forbidden or purged from whatever impugned the Church of  Rome And here he com∣mends the Treatise written by  Gabriel Putherbeus De tollendis Libris malis  as what has discovered the Wickedness of their Bishops Priests and Monks better than any Work our Author knows In the latter end of this Part we have a  Table of the Divinity  Books first set forth and approved then censured by  Papists  This Catalogue contains of their said  forbidden Books  which are often noted in what Parts they have been purged Among them there are some of our own Authors as  Alcuinus  whose Book  de Trini∣tate ad Carolum Regem  printed in  Bibl Patrum  is falsely by  Sextus Senensis  and others attributed to  Calvin  tho' in∣deed their Names are one by a  Metathesis  and Change of the Letters Whereas Copies of it written above Years ago were to be seen in the  Prince's Library  at St  James's  and elsewhere St  Adhelm  Bishop of  Sherburne  has also incurred the  Roman  Censure and the  Summes  of  Richard FitzRauf  Archbishop of  Armagh  against the  Armenians  with his other Treatises are caution'd against as printed Anno by  Possevine  and in Bishop  Fisher  's Book  de Fiducia Dei  the  Papists  finding some Points against them have pretended it was printed by some  Heretic  in his Name and even by  Calvin  according to  Gregory Capuchine  A silly shift for the Book was printed at  Cologn  in  vo  shortly after his Death and since then no such Matter was ever heard till of late Years  "A very likely Matter says our Author that the  Papists  wou'd suffer such a piece of Knavery to lie buried so long Again what reason have  Protestants  to counterfeit such a Book in a  Papist  's Name Seeing their  Indices of Books forbidden and to be purged  do furnish us with a sufficient Number in this kind without any Labour of ours So much the more are we kindly beholden unto them first for sending us unto the best  Books  by their  Catalogue  of Books prohibited and secondly for directing us unto the best  Places  to be read in those Books by their  Indices Expurgatorii  "  Nay  Gildas Sapiens  was not so  wise  as to see that his Works shou'd come to be censur'd at  Rome  for otherwise he wou'd to be sure have prevented them and retracted his Opinion Much less cou'd  William  of  Occham  's  Dialogues  his  Works of    Days  and his  Writings  against Pope  John  XXII escape  the  Catalogue  of  Books forbidden  Besides some others o  our Countrymen in this Table also mentioned At the End of which we have a little Summary of the Uses thereof under the Consideration of what  Popes Patriarchs Bi∣shops Cardinals Fathers Saints Martyrs  c  Councils Liturgies Prayerbooks Bibles  c are censur'd therein also by what degrees Books have been corrupted with what Opposition the Inquisitors being still at odds with us and themselves what  Popish  Authors through all Ages have maintained the Truth of our Religion what Books and Editions are to be read by Protestants lastly what is con∣stantly denied by the Papists That the Text of the Fa∣thers Works is commanded to be purged in their several  Indices Expurgatorii  and plainly proved in this  Table  by the Mark of a Hand in the Margin In this Table our Author doubts not but many Writers have slipped his Pen Wherein he desired not Exactness but to give you a Taste only of that sour Fruit which they have grafted upon o∣ther Mens Stocks He has cited nothing without a suffi∣cient Author or Authority And as for the Books of Law Physick and the Arts which the Papists have thus mangled and disfigured they are reserved for some other time this Part ending at p  Part V  A Remedy against all Popish Corruptions  Herein the Author shews how vain it is to find out the Diseases in Books without we endeavour to find out the Remedies also This last Part containing Pages begins with an Account of the sundry Ways how Books are depraved and corrupted and three Ways proposed for reforming the same That the Discovery of false Treatises in the Name of the Fathers has in part been made by the Bishop of  Winchester  Dr  Reynolds Abraham Scultetus  and especially Master  Robert Cooke  of  Leedes  How the Corruption of the true Fathers is to be known and that those Places purged by the Inquisitors are to be restored as fast by the Protestants Of a Catechism to be framed for us out of their Writings and how Papists are to be answered by Papists The Collations of this kind by Mr  W Crashaw  of the  Temple  commended How the  Romish  Falsifica∣tions might be shortly discovered by dividing the Exami∣nation among many Divines The Profit of Collating prin∣ted Books with the  Indices Expurgatorii  Their late cor∣rected Editions to be considered and suspected Of their pretended Discovery of lost Writers in Caves Mountains  c  The Popish Editions of the Fathers to be compared with ancient MSS How the Fathers Works were cor∣rupted before and since Printing the Ways of correcting them Our Universities and private Libraries well stor'd with MSS notwithstanding the great Consumption of them in  England  An Exhortation to private Men not to monopolize but communicate their MSS seeing that how commendably soever they preserve them little Use can be made of them nor their Authorities safely vouch'd since they are not always to be seen while such Owners are liv∣ing and when they die may easily miscarry by falling into the Hands of such as regard them not by whom as one merrily said  Monyscripts  are more pored upon than  Manuscripts  That the Neglect of the Fathers has pro∣ceeded from the false Editions of them and that there would be an End of Controversy if their Works were truly printed An Objection from the divers Readings of ancient MSS Another against the Antiquity and Integrity of Copies with Answers The Satisfaction of small Diffe∣rences in Copies Our  English  MSS highly esteemed be∣yond Seas Our Founders of Colleges careful to furnish their Libraries with rare MSS maintaining divers Scholars abroad to compare transcribe or procure Originals That  Richard Dunelmensis  Founder of  Duresme  College now called  Trinity  College bestowed many thousand Pounds  per Annum  in Books and most of his Books upon the Li∣brary he erected in that College who for his exceeding great Love of Learning did well deserve the Name of  Philobiblos  See his Book  De Amore Librorum  printed at  Oxford    De eo dictumerat quod haberet plures Libros quam omnes Pontifices in Anglia  Which Title and Character since his Time is most justly to be given to Sir  T Bodley  whose great Munificence has far surpassed the Bishop hav∣ing stored his Magazine as our Author observes with  eleven  or  twelve thousand Volumes  whereof the greatest part are in  Folio  in all Sciences and Languages and fre∣quented by Scholars of all Nations Here follows the Con∣fession of his Adversaries  Possivine  and  Costerus  of the Goodness and Plenty of our Books the Way of discern∣ing corrected Copies and to know if they be ancient or not That those which are written in a set Hand with great Letters or in the  Lombard  or  Saxon  Characters are of great Antiquity how far later MSS to be esteemed of The Objection that it is a tedious and needless Work to  collate the Fathers Works with MSS answered The Benefit likely to arise of a general Collation Commenda∣tions of Erasmus and wherein defective in his Animad∣versions upon the Fathers Works That he gave the first Alarm of their barbarous corrupting the Fathers for which his very Name is in  Maledictione  Exhortation to our wealthy Stationers to print the Fathers Works such as Mr  Geo Bishop  Mr  Bonham Norton  and Mr  John Norton  who have been chosen Aldermen of  London  That the Charge of Printers and Stationers ought to be well recom∣pensed They are compared to our MerchantsAdventurers Why the Hazard being alike in most Books they should seek rather to deserve well of the ancient Fathers The Bible compared revised and printed this Year St  Chrysostom  's Works with several other of the  Greek  Fathers likely to be printed at the unspeakable Charge of the learned and judicious Provost of  Eton  College and Warden of  Mer∣ton  College in  Oxford  Sir  Henry Savile  well seen in the best Languages and most of the Liberal Arts The  Latin  Fathers more urged in all Controversies should be the sooner correctly printed The Collation and Revision of the Fathers Works a good Inducement to the printing of them The Use that is made of the MSS indifferently both by Protestants and Papists whereof tho' much re∣mains to be spoken our Author like a weary Traveller here takes up his rest which indeed he might well need having gone through such a Variety of Books as this Work does manifest and really held it as  Baronius  pretended to do a Religion to say nothing which he could not prove and to prove nothing but out of certain known and sufficient Authors At the End of his  Advertisement  mentioned at the beginning there is an  Appendix  shewing first how there are Scribes diligently employ'd in the  Vatican  Libra∣ry to transcribe Acts of the Councils or Works of the Fathers that they can imitate their Copies exactly that it is feared they alter and change at the Pope's pleasure and that these Transcripts in time may be vouched for ancient MSS And this is more to be feared if there is an  Index Expurgatorius  for purging of MSS as well as printed Books  Secondly  That the unknown Author of  the Grounds of the Old Religion and the New  so often mention'd in this Work is now known to be one  May  a Priest a Man neither immodest nor unlearned yet foully mistaken in sun∣dry Points of his Answer to Mr  Crashaw  's first  Tome  of  Romish Forgeries and Falsifications  What we have lastly to observe is That at the End of the whole Book there is a  Table  of the  Authors  mentioned in this  Treatise  with the particular  Editions  made use of throughout the same  XXXVI  The  YOUNGER BROTHER'S APOLOGIE  or a Father's Free Power disputed for the Disposition of his Lands or other his Fortunes to his Son Sons or any one of them As right  Reason  the  Laws  of God and Nature  the  Civil Canon  and  Municipal Laws of this Kingdom do com∣mand  Quarto  Oxford  Pages  THIS scarce Tract is dedicated by the Author to all  Fathers  and  Sons  of  worthy Families  whom Virtue Birth and Learning have justly stiled  Gentlemen  And in the said Address has these Asseverations  "Not upon the least Presumption of a Selfsufficiency to confront there∣by any received Custom if any such be nor to dimi∣nish the natural Reverence due by  younger Brothers  to their Elder nor to enkindle Emulation in Families nor to innovate any thing to the Prejudice of public or pri∣vate Quiet which none I hope will be so illaffected as to suppose neither mine inoffensive Zeal for younger Brothers among who I am ranked one nor the abso∣lute Consent of Imperial and Ecclesiastical Laws which I having a little studied not a little respect nor the particular Honour I bear to the Usages in this Point of our ancient  Britains  from whom I am descended nor desire to maintain and justify an Act in this kind done by a Friend whom I must ever reverence nor yet the hope of bettering my private Fortunes which moves Men much in these our Times hath drawn me to this Undertaking But principally the singular Respect which as a Patriot I bear to the Glory and Good of  Gentlemens Houses  whose best Original surest Means of Maintainance and principal Ornament is Virtue or Force of Mind the want whereof is a common Cause of Ruin The  free Power  therefore of  you  who are  Fathers  is here in some special Cases argued and de∣fended to give you occasion thereby to consider with the clearer Eyesight for the Establishment and Con∣tinuance of Families Here also the natural Rights of  us  that are  Children  be so discoursed and discussed as that we  younger Brothers  may have Cause and Courage to endeavour by virtuous Means to make ourselves without the least wrong to any capable if need shall be of the chiefest Uses And both and all are so handled as that no Offence can reasonably arise in any respect much less for that the whole is conceived and written in Nature only of an Essay or Probleme to which I bind no Man to afford more Belief than himself hath liking of being free to refute the whole or any part at his pleasure as he feels himself able or disposed"  In the Conclusion of this  Epistle  the Author observes that nothing in this  Apology  is defended but by Authority Rea∣son and Example nor any Person taxed or particular personal Vices nevertheless if he has not performed as well as he desires or the Cause deserves he hopes that for his good Intention he shall be conceived well of and sub∣scribes the two Letters of his Name  J A  The Work is divided into  ten Chapters  whereof the first shews the Occasion of writing this  Apology  to prove that a Father may in some Cases make any of his Children his Heir or freely dispose his worldly Estate to which of his Sons he pleases leaving to the rest a Competency and do an Act which may be just according to the Law of God of Nature and of Nations The d Chapter maintains That the Grounds of all good Constitutions being in Nature yet she neither before nor after the Law of Propriety esta∣blish'd did command that  all  should be left to any  one  more than  another  herein is also shewn the happy  Community  of all things in the primitive Ages and that  hereditary Succes∣sion  or Title to Parents Lands or Goods was not in use till Nature came to be depraved That the Breach of some written Laws of God upon Warrant of the primary Law of Nature is without Sin and that therefore there can be no such Right in  Primogeniture  which is not in the Father's Power to avoid tho' there were a Precept to the contra∣ry as there is not That Nations beginning to devise sundry Forms of settling  Inheritances  the  Romans  especi∣ally therein respected the free Power of Fathers the Right of Children to their Fathers Estates beginning only at  their Father's Death That the present Custom of our Country of giving  all  or  almost all  to the  Eldest  was never so begun that it meant to exclude just Remedies for such Evils as should grow out of the Abuse of that Custom when it may make Fathers guilty of their Sons Faults and of their Families Ruin That it is no Offence before God for a Father being Tenant in  Feesimple  to disinherit the Eldest or to parcel his Estate upon Cause and that extream Vices of  Heirs apparent  together with the fewer Means which younger Brothers have now to live on than heretofore crieth out against the contrary Opinion That Fathers being Tenants in  Feetail  may likewise with∣out Scruple of Conscience discontinue the  Statetail  upon Cause and devise the same at their reasonable Pleasure That  Unthriftiness  is one known Name of many hidden Sins and is alone a sufficient Cause of  Disinherison  proved by the Law of God and Man The main Points of the Premises exemplified in divers particular Facts as well of Princes as of private Persons That the Law of na∣tural Equity and Reason confirm just  Disinherison  and that the riotous Lives of eldest Brothers deserve that vehe∣ment Increpation with  which  the Author closes up this Treatise  Before we part with this Subject we shall here take the Opportunity we have of referring to a couple of scarce Tracts more ancient than this above recapitulated which have some Parts or Chapters in them relating thereunto The first is called  New∣nam's Nightcrow a Bird that breedeth  Braules  in many  Families  and  Housholds  Wherein is remember'd that kindly and provident Regard which  Fathers  ought to have towards their  Sons  together with a Disciphering of the injurious Dealings of some younger sort of  Stepdames Quarto Pages This Pamphlet is dedicated to  Thomas Owen  Esq  Serjeant at Law by the Au∣thor  John Newnam  Is divided into  Two Parts  and each into five Chapters The first Part is concerning  Fathers  shewing chiefly how the Virtues or Vices of their  Children  proceed most∣ly from their Examples And the second Part upon  Stepmothers  ends with two Chapters under these Titles  That disinheriting of the  eldest Son  without very great  lawful Cause  is an Act very wrongful and ungodly That Procurers and Counsellors of Disinhe∣rison and all wrong doing ought to make or procure Restitution  But as strong Arguments as there are herein against the disin∣heriting of Heirs tho' several Crimes are produced which they being convicted of it is allowed yet they seem match'd in that other Pamphlet we mention'd which is a Dialogue entitled  A Work worth the Reading containing five Questions very ex∣pedient as well for  Parents  to perceive how to bestow their  Chil∣dren  in  Marriage  and to dispose their  Goods  at their  Death  as for all other Persons to receive great Profit by the rest of the Mat∣ters herein expressed  Newly published by  Charles Gibbon  and  dedicated  to the Right Worshipful Sir  Nicholas Bacon  Q  o  Pages The second Chapter of this Tract is upon the Question  Whether the Father may lawfully disinherit his Firstborn  where tho' there are Arguments produced on both sides of the Question yet we are induced to discard a leud lavish Repro∣bate of an  eldest Son  a riotous Spendthrift which is a Charac∣ter less criminal than those produced by the former Author for a  younger  that is dutiful virtuous and prudent For that  "a wise Man will alter Custom after Discretion and dispose his Wealth according to Wisdom"  And a little further  "Goods are the Gift of God and he hath appointed us not to do as we list with them like  Lords  but to dispose them well as his  Stewards  Therefore we ought to bestow them on such where he that gave them may be glorified"  according to the A∣postle's Command which is here cited Thus much may suf∣fice in this Place if not to satisfy the Reader yet to inform him where he may meet with further Satisfaction upon a Subject of this important and universal Concern    XXXVII  SCOT's  Discovery of  WITCHCRAFT  Proving the common Opinions of  Witches  contracting with  Devils Spirits Fa∣miliars  and their Power to kill torment and consume the Bodies of  Men Women  and  Children  or other Creatures by  Diseases  or otherwise their  flying  in the  Air c  to be but imaginary erroneous Conceptions and Novelties Wherein also the Practices of  Witchmongers Conjurers Inchanters Soothsayers  also the Delusions of  Astrology Alchemy Legerdemain  and many other things are opened that have long lain hidden tho' very necessary to be known for the undeceiving of  Judges Justices  and  Juries  and for the Preservation of  poor People c  With a Treatise also upon the Nature c of  Spirits  and  Devils c Quarto Pages be∣sides Tables c  THIS curious Book so elaborately written upon these uncommon Subjects and first published by  Reginald Scot  Esq  in as appears also in the TitlePage of this Edition had for a while a very good EfFect upon the  Kingdom in purging those Dregs of Superstition to which it seems naturally subject by the  Paroxysms  into which it has so frequently relapsed  James Ady  M A in his  Per∣fect Discovery of Witches  published in to ten Years after this Edition of Mr  Scot  's Book now before us tells us  "It did for some time take great Impression in the Ma∣gistracy and also in the Clergy but since that time  England  hath shamefully fall'n from the Truth which they begun to receive"  Further it appears in the third Book of this Mr  Ady's Discovery  which detects the  Vanity  of some  English Writers  concerning  Witches  and principally that  Dialogue  of King  James  's called  Demonologie  first printed at  Edinburgh  to that the said King has in the  Preface  thereof chiefly objected to this Work of  Scot  's wherefore the Reader might expect in the Body of his Majesty's Pamphlet to find our Author notably confuted but in reading that  Dialogue  he shall not find one thing or other answered but only a bare Affirmation of such Tenets without Ground or Warrant of Scripture which were confuted by  Scot  as the Tenets of  Bodin Hyperius Hemin∣gius  and other Popish Writers which might yet bring a Discredit upon  Scot  's Book in those Understandings which are to be dazled by Names that glare with great Titles or Dignities but with discerning and unbiass'd Judges an Antagonist of such Character and such Conduct will but raise the Credit of the Works he opposes All we have further to premise of our Author is from  A Wood  who informs us That he was the younger Son of Sir  John Scot  of  ScotsHall  near  Smeeth  in  Kent  that he was bred at  Oxford  and  "gave himself up solely to solid Reading to the Perusal of obscure Authors that had by the genera∣lity of Scholars been neglected"  And at Times of leisure to Husbandry and Gardening as may appear from his  Perfect Platform of a HopGarden  which was the first Treatise that had been written upon this Subject and from this  Discovery of Witchcraft  which also he seems to have  first detected publickly at least in our Nation In both  "our Author plainly appears to have been well versed in many choice Books and that his search into them was so profound that nothing slipt his Pen which might make for his Purpose"  As to this Work now under our Inspection there are Three ingenious Epistles publish'd by our Author before it Two of them to Sir  Roger Manwood  Lord Chief Baron of the  Exchequer  and to Sir  Thomas Scot  and the third to Dr  Coldwell  Dean of  Rochester  and Dr  Readman  Arch∣deacon of  Canterbury  Then follows his  Epistle  to the  Reader  in which he solemnly professes his Drift in this Undertak∣ing was That the Power and Glory of God shou'd not be abridg'd or abased that Religion might stand without the Trumpery of such Impostures and that Compassion might be used towards those poor ignorant Souls who are com∣monly accused and sometimes credulously confess them∣selves guilty of Witchcraft At the End of this Epistle there is a  Table  of between two and three Hundred Authors used in the ensuing Work which is divided into  Sixteen Books  and they into many Chapters beginning with an Im∣peachment of the Power of Witches in Meteors and Ele∣mentary bodies tending to the Rebuke of such as attri∣bute too much unto them So proceeds in the next Chap∣ter to the Inconvenience growing by Men's Credulity here∣in and a Reproof of some Churchmen inclined to the common Opinion of Witches Omnipotency with a familiar Example thereof in the Story of  Margaret Simons  of  Brenchley  in  Kent  who being accused of Witchcraft by  John Ferral  Vicar of that Parish was arraign'd in at  Rochester  but one of the Jury being wiser than the rest she was acquit∣ted Next we have a Description of those who are called Witches the Motives to their being thought and thinking themselves Witches What miraculous Acts are imputed to them by Witchmongers Papists and Poets Confutations of the Opinion of Witchcraft and the Sin of repairing to  Witches  for help how their Name became so famous and how variously People think of them Causes why  Witches  themselves as well as others believe they can work Impossi∣bilities with Answers to certain Objections where also their Punishment by Law is touch'd and some late credulous Pub∣lications reflected on This Book concludes with an Ar∣raignment of the Cruelties practis  d upon old Women in all  Ages since the Commencement of Popery by Witch∣mongers and Inquisitors  The Second Book shews what infamous Witnesses are allowed to give Evidence against reputed Witches and upon what hard Conditions to be challeng'd as  James Sprenger  and  Henry Institor  from whom  Bodin  and other Cham∣pions of Witchmongers receive their Light allow Next follows the Order of their Examination with an Account of the  Scottish  Customs of accusing Witches and King  Chil∣debert

Tortures to pro∣cure Confession The fifteen Crimes laid to their charge refuted  Cornelius Agrippa  's Pleadings for an old Woman condemn'd of Witchcraft That it is no wonder Witches condemn themselves thro' the Barbarities used in extorting their Confessions  The Third Book lays open the Bargains charged upon these reputed Witches with the Devil by several Popish Witchmongers here mention'd with the Order of their Homage to the Devil Their Songs Dances Excourses  c  Their Summons to appear before the Devil riding in the Air Conferences Supplies Sacrifices  c  That there can be no real League made with the Devil with the weak Proofs of the Adversaries for the same Of the private League with the Devil  Bodin  's fabulous Miracle of the  French  Lady transported from  Lions  to  Lorrain  by an Oint∣ment A Disproof of their Assemblies and their Bargains A Confutation of the Objection concerning Witches Con∣fessions What folly it were for Witches to undergo such de∣sperate Peril and intolerable Tortures for the little Gain and great Disappointments they meet with and how it comes to pass they are overthrown by their Confessions How Melancholy abuses old Women and the Effects thereof in sundry Examples That voluntary Confessions may be un∣truly made tho' to the undoing of the Confessors and of the strange Operation of Melancholy proved by a late In∣stance in the story of  Ade Davie  of  Sellenge  in  Kent  O∣ther strange Effects of Melancholy that it frequently a∣bounds in old Women and that their Confessions are not to be credited Confutations of their Confessions concern∣ing their League and causing of Tempests What wou'd be the Consequence if their Confessions were true Exam∣ples  of credulous People who used Witches in the Wars Of the  Eyebiting  Witches in  Ireland  of those pretend∣ed to ryme Man or Beast to death and of inchanted Ar∣chers particularly a poor Fellow at  Malling  in  Kent  who by one of Queen  Mary  's Justices was punish'd for shooting with Flies or Familiars or inchanted Arrows because he cou'd win two or three Shillings aday at the Butts Autho∣rities condemning the Confessions of Witchcraft with the Attempts of a Popish Doctor to disprove the same The Rea∣sons also of Witchmongers to prove the WonderWorkings of these old Women  Bodin  's Tale of the  Frieseland  Priest transported and the further Illusions of melancholy Ima∣ginations Of the Sufficiency of Witches Confessions in Law to take away Life with the Decrees of Divines and Coun∣cils in the Case Answers to the four Capital Crimes ob∣jected against Witches The Author's Request that his chaste Readers wou'd overlook Eight Chapters in the fol∣lowing Book reciting some lewd Feats ascribed to Witches by Doctors of Popish Divinity with his Apology for the same as necessary to be detected  The Fourth Book exposes the presumptuous Opinions of Witchmongers in ascribing the superior Power to evil Spi∣rits of framing themselves in more excellent sort than God has made us with their absurd Assertions of the incongru∣ous Conjunctions of Witches with  Incubus  that since the Year they have consented willingly to the Carnal Embraces of this Diabolical Phantom and that many Witches burn'd at  Ravenspurge  confessed such Carnal Knowledge for many Years together with many other Te∣nets of the said unaccountable Intercourse most grossly un∣philosophical and improbable to have met with the Recep∣tion they have done among the most Ignorant such as the Devil's visible Dealings with Women in this kind the Pow∣er of Witches to obstruct Generation and their supernatu∣rally depriving Men of the  Paris  thereof The Legend of St  Sylvanus  personated by  Incubus  and of St  Christina  who charitably supplying the Place of a Female oppress'd with one was shrewdly accloy'd Also another ridiculous Legend of St  Bernard  with the Tradition of yellowhair'd Maids being most encumber'd with  Incubus  and the be∣witchery of married Men to use other Mens Wives in∣stead of their own how to procure the dissolving of be∣witched Love and enforce Men to love old Hags with the relation of a lewd Trick of a Priest in  Gelderland  In∣stances  of divers Saints very letcherously disposed and mi∣raculously render'd chaste A recital of certain Popish and Magical Cures for those who are bewitch'd in their Privi∣ties among which we have the wise distinction of  Hostiensis  between Frigidity and Witchcraft also Sir  Thomas More  's Receipt to procure Generation mention'd but not recited even in  Latin  as the former is being too gross in our Au∣thor's mind for Repetition This Chapter concludes with the pious Offering made by  Katharine Loe  of a waxen Re∣semblance of the Parts affected in her impotent Husband at the Altar of St  Anthony  for his Recovery After these and the Narrative of another Cure performed on a Hagrid∣den MassPriest from the Account of  Jason Pratensis  This Book concludes with a Confutation of these Follies touching  Incubus  and  Succubus  shewing them to be nothing but Popish Imposture and Knavery to cover the shameful Debaucheries of the  Ecclesiasticks  and their  Concubines  That  Robin Goodfellow  was nothing but a lusty cosening Frier and that there can be no Carnal Copulation with Spirits much less any Offspring therefrom whatever  Hyperius  and other such Deceivers write of our  Merlin  That  Incu∣bus  is a natural Disease and of the Remedies prescribed for the same with the Derision which  Chaucer  who had seen through these  Popish  Abominations long since made of the Priests under that Name quoted from his own Verses in the  Wife of Bath  's Tale  The Fifth Book lays open and confutes with many Ar∣guments and Authorities the absurd Accounts of  Transfor∣mations  by Sorcery into Wolves Asses Cats  c  An∣swers the Witchmongers Objections concerning  Nebuchad∣nezzar  with their Error relating to  Lycanthropia  and answers also their Arguments for  Transportation  and from the Calamities of  Job  concluding with the several sorts of Witches mention'd in the Scriptures and how the word Witch is there apply'd  The Sixth Book begins with an Exposition of the  He∣brew  Word  Chasaph  wherein is answer'd that Objection in  Exodus Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live  also of  Si∣mon Magus  in  Acts  An Explanation also of that Place in  Deuteronomy  wherein are recited all kind of Witches with a Confutation of their Opinions who hold they can work such Miracles as are imputed to them Observations upon the Use of Poison by Women in all Ages more than Men Of divers Practitioners with Poison in many Coun∣tries  called  Veneficia  A great Objection answer'd con∣cerning this kind of Witchcraft called  Veneficium  What Confections used therein Of Philtres or LovePotions and the same confuted by Poets Proofs that such Potions rather promote Death tbro' their Venom than Love by Art with a recital of many simple Ingredients on which this Power is imposed And this Chapter concludes with  Bodin  's Charge of false  Greek  and false Interpretation there∣of against  John Wier  retorted upon himself  The Seventh Book begins with explaining the  Hebrew  Word  Ob  in the  Old Testament  translated  Pytho  or  Phyoni∣cus Spiritus  which  Hebrew  Word signifying most properly a Bottle is there used because the  Pythonists  spake  hollow  as in the bottom of their Bellies whereby they are aptly in  Latin  call'd  Ventriloqui  of which sort was  Elizabeth Barton  the  Holy Maid of Kent  c by which Faculty they many times overthrow the good Fame of honest Per∣sons But our Author passing over a hundred Cosenages he cou'd recite of this kind does here give us a large and true Story of a Wench named  Mildred Norrington  practi∣sing her diabolical Witchcraft by this  Ventriloquy Anno  at  Westwell  in  Kent  six Miles from his own House with the Account of her detection before two discreet Ju∣stices named  Thomas Wotton  of  Bocton Malherb  and  George Darrel  Esqs Here says our Author compare this Wench with the Witch of  Endor  and you shall see that both the Cosenages may be done by one Art The Discovery also of other such Deceivers as  Agnes Brigs  and  Rachel Pinder  of  London  who disgorged Pins Clouts  c  and the  Dutch∣man  at  Maidstone  named  John Stiklebow  who was dispossess'd of Ten Devils in according to the Pamphlet then printed The Abuses of  Apollo  's Oracle the Apostle's mis∣take of Spirits with Arguments that they can assume no Shapes Further of  Apollo  's Witches call'd  Pythonists  and of  Gregory  's Letter to the Devil with a Comparison be∣tween the Idol of  Apollo  and our Rood of Grace thro' the help of little St  Rumbal  at  Boxly  in  Kent  How many learned Men have been deluded in their Writings upon this Subject of Spirits More of the Witch of  Endor  and that  Samuel  was not raised indeed the Dotage of  Bodin  and o∣ther  Papists  herein and that Souls cannot be raised by Witchcraft That neither the Devil nor  Samuel  were rais∣ed but that it was a mere Trick according to the Guise of our  Pythonists  Answers to the Objections of our Witch∣mongers  in this Case Expositions of the Places in Scrip∣ture shewing how  Saul  was abused and how it might all be wrought by  Ventriloquy  With other Opinions produced and answer'd tending to prove that our Miracles are com∣monly Knaveries and especially of the Priests that since  Luther  's Time these Spirits Hags Fairies Imps Incubi Robin Goodfellows Men in the Oak Puckles Firedrakes Hobgoblins Tomthumbs and all the rest of this Black Brood of Bullbeggars have much vanish'd and very little appear'd and lastly that those who will credit the Stories of Witches must allow as much to their Power of working Miracles as to that of  Christ  The Eighth Book shews us how Miracles the Gift of Prophecy and Oracles are ceased with a recital of  Plu∣tarch  's Tale believed by many learned Men of the  Devil  's  Death  and another out of the  Golden Legend  of a  godly Devil  The Judgment of the Fathers upon Oracles and their Abolishment with their Transplantation from  Del∣phos  to  Rome  also where when and how the priestly Sorcerers wrought their Feats of old and when they ceased in  England  The Ninth Book expounds the word  Kasam  or Divi∣nation proves from Scripture the Lawfulness of making Ob∣servations on the Weather that of other Observations some are Indifferent some Ridiculous and some Impious Fur∣ther of the Idol of  Apollo  and the ancient  Aruspices  Of the Predictions of Soothsayers and Lewd Priests Astrono∣mers Physicians and of Divine Prophecy The diversity of True Prophets of  Urim  and the Prophetical Use of the twelve Precious Stones therein and of the Divine Voice called  Echo  Of Prophecies Conditional Whereof the Prophecies in the  Old Testament  do treat and by whom they were publish'd with some Answers against Witches supernatural Actions Of the Mircales in the  Old  and  New Testament  and that we are not now to expect any more such  The Tenth Book interprets the word  Onen  and there∣upon discourses of divine natural and casual  Dreams  with their Causes and Effects The variance of old Writers touching Dreams Against the Interpreters of Dreams and that the Interpretation of them is ceased Of  Hemingius  his diabolical Dreams and that Witches nor any other can impose upon sleeping Men what Cogitations they list The Cause of Magical or rather frightful Dreams How Men  have been deluded by Dreams to dig for Money with the Order and Ceremony used therein also an Account of Re∣ceipts for procuring pleasant Dreams and the difference be∣tween Morning and Midnight Dreams Receipts of Unc∣tions used for the Transportation of Witches with a Con∣futation of these Follies and of the Witches Assemblies and Banquets That the Prophecies in the  Old Testament  were mostly revealed in Dreams and that such Revelations are not now to be look'd for Of some Dreams coming to pass others proving contrary and  Nebuchadnezzar  's Rule to know a true Expositor of them  The Eleventh Book begins with the Exposition of  Nahas  or the flying of Birds called  Augury  so passes to the  Jewish  Sacrifice to  Moloch  with an Argument against Purgatory The Cannibal Custom of the  Popish  Sacrifice in the Mass The Superstition of the  Heathens  about Fire Of the  Ro∣man  Sacrifices and their Esteem of Augury That the Practisers of that Art were Coseners Of the Ceremonies thereunto belonging Upon what Signs and Tokens they did prognosticate Observations on the Parts of Beasts A Confutation of  Augury Plato  's Opinion thereof Of con∣trary Events and false Predictions The Cosenage of  Sorti∣lege  or Lotteries Of the  Cabalistical  Art Of the first Or∣daining and Profanation of Sacrifices and of the Pope's Cor∣ruption of Sacrifices Of the Objects upon which the Au∣gures exercis'd their Prognostications Of the Divisions in the Art Persons admittable and other Superstitions e∣specially by the common People The variance of old Wri∣ters upon this Art wherefore it is ridiculous derided by  Cato Aristotle  c Of the silly Distinctions made thereof Of  Figureflingers  and the Uncertainty of their Art The Sentence of  Cornelius Agrippa  against judicial  Astrology  The Subtilties and Impieties thereof with further Instances of the Deceits of these  Genethliacs  or NativityCasters  The Twelfth Book treats of Inchantments from the  Hebrew  Word  Habar  In what Sense Words may be al∣low'd as  Charms  What is forbidden in Scripture concern∣ing Witchcraft The Superstition of the  Cabilists  and  Pa∣pists  The Offence of Charms and what wou'd follow if the Effects ascribed to them were true Why God forbade the practice of Witchcraft The Absurdity of the Law of the Twelve Tables whereon their Estimation in miraculous Actions is grounded An Instance of one arraign'd upon the Law of those Tables where the said Law is proved ridicu∣lous  Laws for the Punishment of Witches that work Mi∣racles and of  Popish  Laws against them A Recital of the Poetical Authorities alledg'd by Witchmongers for the Proof of Witches A Collection of  Popish  Tablets Amulets Charms Agnus Dei  c  against Diseases Casualties  c  How to make Holy Water with several other Receipts and the Opinion of  Ferrarius  touching them Of  Homerical  Me∣dicines and several other  Popish  Charms for Man and Beast especially for the Duke of  Alva  's Horse which was conse∣crated or canoniz'd in the  Low Countries  at the solemn Mass wherein the Pope's Bull and his Charm was publish'd the Duke sitting as Viceroy with his consecrated Standard in his Hand till the Solemnity was over Several Accounts of the charming of Serpents Snakes  c Mahomet  's Pidgeon the tractable Ass at  Memphis  with many other Instances of Charms particularly with  waxen Images  whereby the Im∣postures of Mother  Baker  a famous  Kentish  Witch were discover'd Several Receipts used of old to make Charms as St  Adelbert  's against Thieves the Pope's Incantation in to the  Spaniards  for Success in the  LowCountry  Wars  c  ending with a Confutation of the Virtues falsely ascribed to such Charms and Amulets by ancient Writers  The Thirteenth Book opens with explaining the  Hebrew  Word  Hartumim  or Natural Magic and shews how the Antients travell'd for the Knowledge thereof Of  Solomon  's Knowledge therein the distinction thereof and why it is condemn'd for Witchcraft That this Study teacheth only the Works of Nature What wonderful Effects are disco∣ver'd by it in Waters Precious Stones with the Use there∣of by Magicians the Sympathy and Antipathy of Natural and Elementary Bodies particularly of two notorious Won∣ders not marvell'd at The one a Piece of Earth which would fly the hot Steel with great swiftness and pursue Gold as fast with other Properties more incredible the other a strange Stone which wou'd shine bright in the Dark always labour'd to ascend  c  But the former of these be∣ing found to signify a Man the latter a Fire our Author applies the manner of Expression to that often used in Magic which sometimes consists as well in the deceit of Words as slight of Hand and this introduces the Illusions and Confe∣deracies here display'd in the Art of  Legerdemain  Here he observes the Admiration there was at  Brandon  the Juggler who by the Wounds and Words he used upon the Picture of a  Dove  painted on the Wall promised the King before  whom he performed perhaps  Edward  VI it being still in remembrance that a live Dove then on the HouseTop should fall down dead which it did accordingly The Juggler was forbidden the Practice of this Feat as if he could murder any body so in Effigie tho' the Mystery being here revealed he appeared not to have more dange∣rous Power than any other body We have here also many other of the Juggler's Tricks recited and revealed Obser∣vations on  Pharaoh  's Magicians a Comparison between them and our Witches Many strange Experiments by Glasses and the perspective Art Remarks on the Feats of  Jannes  and  Jambres  also on  Balaam  's Ass But the Trick which was called the  Decollation  of  John Baptist  perform'd by one  Kingsfield  at  London  in was long practised with great Surprize to the Spectators as the League of  Stephen Taylor  and one  Pope  the one to steal Horses and the other to discover them seems to have been with Pro∣fit to the Confederates But the most dexterous Fellow for  Legerdemain  in our Author's Time was  John Cauta∣res  of St  Martin's  not that himself was a mean Artist for says he  "If Time Place and Occasion serve I can shew so much herein that I am sure  Bodin Spinaeus  and  Vairus  would swear I were a Witch and had a fa∣miliar Devil at Commandment But truly my Study and Travel herein hath only been employed to the end I might prove them Fools and find out the Fraud of them that make them Fools as whereby they may become wiser and God may have that which to him belongeth"  With this and the Patters or Prints of some juggling In∣struments beforementioned our Author ends this Chapter  The Fourteenth Book treats of the Craft of Alchemy re∣cites  Chaucer  's Character and Opinion of Alchemists and their Terms of Art Their Pretensions by the Philoso∣phers Stone and Waters with other Characters and De∣tections of them by  Chaucer  in his  Chanon  's Yeoman's Tale Several Stories of Persons cousened by Alchemists among the rest that of  Erasmus  in his  Colloquies  The Opinion of some learned Men touching the Folly of Al∣chemy as  Avicenna Petrarch c  That vain and de∣ceitful Hope is the Cause of Delusion hereby ending with the Story of the Courtier who gave King  Lewis  XI a fine Horse because his Majesty had given a Peasant who had of∣ten entertained him in his Hunting Diversions a thousand  Crowns for a Turnip in hopes of a proportionable Re∣ward but received the Countryman's Present for his own  The fifteenth Book having shewn the Significations of the Word  Jidoni  a sort of Conjurers whom our Author calls No small Fools as not going to work with a Toad or a Cat as Witches do but with a kind of Majesty call up by Name and have at Command no less than seventynine principal and princely Devils who have under them as their Ministers many Legions of petty Devils and we have here a List of all their Names with an Account of their Shapes Powers Government their several Segnio∣ries and Degrees The Work of one  T R  in Where∣unto is joined the Hours wherein it is pretended that the principal Devils may be bound or raised and restrained from doing hurt After which follows a Confutation of the manifold Vanities in these Accounts and of the Pre∣dictions derived from the planetary Aspects and Motions whereof we have here several Tables with their Characters The Forms used in the pretended Conjurations of the Spirits of dead Persons and for finding hidden Treasures The Con∣juration of the three Fairy Sisters for the Ring of Invisibi∣lity and for the enclosing of Spirits in a Crystal Stone with Types or Figures explaining the same The Receipt for making of Holywater Compacts with departing Per∣sons to appear and be bound  c  Then follows a Con∣futation of this kind of Conjuration of raising binding and dismissing of the Devil going invisible  c  into which the Assassine was deluded who murdered the Prince of  Orange  Also an Observation that the chief Authors among us of those Conjurations were  T R  beforementi∣oned and  John Cokers  A Comparison between Popish Exorcists and Conjurers The Detection of a late cousening Conjuration practised at  Orleans  by the  Franciscans  Who may be Conjurers in the  Romish  Church besides Priests a ridiculous Definition of Superstition Why there were no Conjurers in the Primitive Church and that it is more difficult to conjure the Devil out of one bewitched than one possessed with many other absurd Distinctions Some Conjurations taken out of the Pontifical and out of the Missal The Rules of Popish Exorcists and other Con∣jurers all one and how St  Martin  conjured the Devil That it is a shame for Papists to believe other Conjurers Doings their own being of so little force with  Hippocra∣tes  's Opinion of the Art How Conjurers have beguiled  Witches What Books they carry about to procure CreditWicked Assertions by the Ancients against  Moses  and  Jo∣seph  All magical Arts confuted by an Argument con∣cerning  Nero  What  Cornelius Agrippa  and  Carolus Gallus  have left written thereof and proved by Experience Of  Solomon  's Conjurations from  Josephus P Lombard Grati∣an Durandus  and the Lessons of the  Romish  Church upon St  Margaret  's Day Those Lessons translated and a ridicu∣lous Story of that St  Margaret  cited Some other Popish Mi∣racles Of Visions Noises Apparitions and imagin'd Sounds wandering Souls and other Illusions with a Confutation thereof  Cardan  's Opinion of strange Noises how coun∣terfeit Visions grow into Credit Of  Boniface  his Knavery in counterfeiting a Voice from Heaven by which he got the Popedom of his silly Predecessor  Coelestinus  Of Echos and  Cardan  's odd Story or a Man who was near being drowned by one and of the strange Noise at  Winchester  which was so much wondered at about tho' indeed a meer natural Noise engendered by the Wind and other concurring Causes Of  Theurgy  or working by good An∣gels with the appendent Arts and the Rejection thereof as altogether papistical and superstitious more particularly exposed in a Letter here recited which was sent to our Author by  T E  Master of Arts Practiser both of Physick and also in times past of certain vain Sciences for which he was now in Prison and condemned to die In this Letter it is confessed by the Writer of it that in twentysix Years practice of these secret Arts and converse with those most familiar in them he could meet with no∣thing true as pretended or supernatural Performance but that it was all Imposture and Delusion and recommends a Book written in the old  Saxon  Tongue by one Sir  John Malborne  a Divine of  Oxenford  three hundred Years past detecting the Devices of Conjuration or opening all the Illusions and Inventions of these Arts and Sciences which Book this Letterwriter had left with the Parson of  Slang∣ham  in  Sussex  where he tells our Author if he would send for it in his Name he might have it But tho' he did send and used the Interest of Men of Worship and Credit particularly of the Knight of the Shire who would have passed his word for the Restitution yet such was the Folly and Superstition of this Parson that he would not lend it for our Author's Perusal But in truth he had so indus∣triously stored himself with other  Authorities  and  Intelli∣gences  that he appears to have little needed those which this Book might have afforded insomuch that whatever lay clouded or shadowed in the Face of Truth by this frightful GreyBeard of Superstition seems here discovered by the Light of those Authorities and that of Reason ac∣cording to this ryming old Verse  Quicquid Nix celat Solis calor omne revelat  The sixteenth Book contains a Conclusion in manner of an Epilogue repeating many of the former Absurdities of Witchmongers with Confutations thereof and the Au∣thorities of  James Sprenger  and  Henry Institor  Inquisitors and Compilers of  Malleus Maleficarum  more particularly by what means the Vulgar have been brought to believe in Witches with a Definition and Description of Witchcraft Reasons to prove that their Charms Characters  c  are all Fables and that those who use them are all Cheats and from the Confessions of the most notorious among them more especially Mother  Bungie  who in divers Books set out with Authority is registered and chronicled by the Name of the Great Witch of  Rochester  who on her Deathbed confessed That her Cunning consisted only in deluding and deceiving the People with some little Skill in Physick and the Assistance of a Friend named  Heron  which was all the Spirit or Devil she had whatever the World had been imposed on to believe Further Detec∣tions of these Knaveries in one so bewitched that he could read no Scripture but canonical and a Devil that could speak no  Latin  Of the Divination by the Sieve and Sheers and by the Book and Key  Hemingius  his Opinion thereof confuted and many other juggling Delusions The Con∣sequences of believing in the Devil's Transformation or as∣suming of different Shapes exemplified in the Instances of Christ's Argument to  Thomas  the Inhabitant of  Tigurie  ap∣pearing to be in wicked Dealings with a Mare as  Lavater  records and the Story of Queen  Cunegunda  from  Crantzius  with her Purgation by the Fiery Ordeal or  Candentis Ferri  After another idle Story expos'd of the Devil preaching holy Doctrine in the shape of a Priest and Arguments to shew what a shame it is after Confutation of the greater Witchcratfs for any Man to give credit to the lesser Points thereof we have a general Conclusion against those whom this Book concerns which with two or three Chapters upon natural Witchcraft or Fascination bewitching Eyes for Hatred and for Love concludes the whole sixteen Book  Then follows a Discourse upon Devils or Spirits and first of Philosophers Opinions also the Manner of their reason∣ing hereupon and the same confuted Herein the Author proceeds to shew how unsatisfactorily all Authors have writ∣ten upon this Subject particularly  Psellus  whose absurd Assertions are here exposed as also  Cardan  's about his Fa∣ther's Familiar Devil  Plato  's Opinion of Spirits and of  So∣crates  's familiar Devil The nine Orders of Spirits and An∣gels according to  Plato  and  Dionysius  The meaning of Arch∣angel according to Mr  Deering  our Author's Kinsman in his Lecture upon the  Hebrews  The Commencement of Devils fondly gathered out of the th of  Isaiah  Of  Lucifer  and his Fall the Opinion of the  Cabalists Talmu∣dists  and Schoolmen of the Creation of Angels The Con∣tention between the  Greek  and  Latin  Church about the Fall and among the Papists Enquiries where the Battle was fought between  Michael  and  Lucifer  how long it continued and what their Forces Other fond Opinions about the fallen Angels particularly among the  Rabbins  Reasons a∣gainst the Devil's Ugliness That the Devil's Assaults are spiritual and how grossly some understand the Scriptures herein The Equivocation of the word Spirit and how diversely taken in the Scriptures Of Christ's healing the Blind and of those possessed with Devils in the Gospel or Lunacy and other Diseases How the word Devil is to be understood both in the singular and plural Number The Variation of Authors about Spirits and Souls Popish Opi∣nions of Spirits of Daydevils and Nightdevils That the Devils mentioned in Scripture have their Nature and Qualities in their Names here mentioned and interpreted The Idols or Gods of the Gentiles distinguished Their  Lares Larvae Manes Daemones  and  Virunculi Terrei c  such as was  Robin Godfellow  in  England  who would supply the Office of Servants specially of Maids and  Hudgin  a very familiar and sociable Hobgoblin in  Germany  so called because he always wore a Cap or Hood therefore our Author thinks him a kind of  Robin Hood  and that our Fryar  Rush  was altogether such another Fellow brought up in the same School the Kitchen insomuch as the selfsame Tale is written of one as the other about the Scullion said to have been slain  c  for the reading whereof we are referred to Friar  Rush  's Story or else to  John Wierus De praestigiis Daemonum  Further of the  Romans  chief Gods called  Dii selecti  the various Gods in other Countries of  Popish provincial Gods as St  George  St  Andrew  c A Comparison between them and Heathen Gods where it appears we have had as great Traitors as great Whores as great Quacks and Impostors among our sanctified and ca∣nonized Tribe as the best of them And whereas our ancient Saints were Patrons only over some one Province of Health or had Power to cure only one Disease nothing comes amiss to our Moderns thro' the Omnipotency of Witchcraft yea greater Matters ascribed to their Powers than to all other Saints witness S Mother  Bongie  S Mother  Paine  S  Feats  S Mother  Still  S Mother  Dutton  S  Kytrell  S  Ursula Kemp  S Mother  Newman  S Doctor  Heron  S  Rosimund  with divers more who deserve to be registered in the Pope's Kalendar or the Devil's Rubric Then follows a Comparison between the Heathens and the Papists touching their Excuses for Idolatry The Idolatry of the Council of  Trent  A notable Story of a Hangman arraign'd after he was dead and buried taken from our Lady's  Rosary  with a Confutation thereof and several o∣ther Tales Of  Moses  and  Elias  appearing in Mount  Ta∣bor  A Confutation of assuming Bodies and of the Ser∣pent tempting Eve Exposition of the Curse rehearsed  Gen    John Calvin  's Opinion of the Devil Our Author's Opinion of the Nature of Spirits and of the Devil with his Properties Against Witchmongers and their idle Opi∣nions of Corporal Devils and particularly against  Brian Darcie  's Distinction of Spirits and the Books published by  W W  and  Richard Gallis  of  Windsor  Then comes the  Conclusion  wherein the Spirit of Spirits is treated of by the Illumination whereof all Spirits are to be tried with a Confutation of the Pneumatomachi denying the Divinity thereof which with a Summary of the Chap∣ters concludes the whole Book  XXXVIII  The  VALEROYAL  of  ENGLAND  or The County Palatine of  CHESTER  Illustrated wherein is contained a Geogra∣phical and Historical Description of that famous County with all its Hundreds Seats Rivers Towns Castles  c  Adorned with Maps and Prospects with the Coats of Arms belonging to every Family Performed by  W SMITH  and  W WEBB  Gentlemen Published by Mr  DANIEL KING  To which is annexed  a Chronology  of all its Rulers and Governors in Church and State Also an excellent Diyscourse of the Isle of  MAN Fol  Thus the common printed Title but there is also a TitlePage printed from a Copper Plate bound before it which entitles the Book more briefly  A Description Historical and Geographical of the County Palatine of  Chester  illustrated with divers Figures cut in Copper and publish'd by  Daniel King  of  Chester 'Tis inviron'd with Branches forming an Oval containing the Arms of all the Earls of  Chester  from  Hugh Lupus  to  Henry  eldest Son of King  James  I and on the Sides thereof are two Standards supported by Wolves and bearing the Arms of the County which are in one of them WheatSheaves and in the other a Wolf's Head eraz'd As for this Publisher  Daniel King  tho'  Ant Wood  might receive a private Character of him from a noted Author in a Letter intimating he was an igno∣rant and knavish Fellow we see not with what Justice the same is published in relation to this Book It is plain that he commendably procured these Accounts of  Chester  which might never have seen the Light but for him and has faithfully pub∣lished them justly ascribing every Part to its due Owner that he hath industriously adorned them with many Sculptures has assumed no part to himself but what was visibly his own and was in so much Credit with the Gentry of the County that many of them were evidently his Patrons and Encouragers wherefore we cannot but think rather with Dr  Fuller  That seeing this  Daniel King  had in his Travels got the Mystery both of  Surveying  and  Engraving  and used the same to enliven the  Descriptions  above which he set forth with so many Cuts of  Heraldry  and  Topography  "That  Cheshire  is chiefly behold∣en to his Pains"  Nay he further acknowledges himself so much beholden to the particular Courtesy of the Man through his many Communications as to have verefied his  Anagram  and been even a  kind Angel  to him    THIS Collection is dedicated by the said  Daniel King  to the Worshipful Sir  Orlando Bridgman  Then fol∣lows a Letter to the Editor by his Cousin  John King  en∣couraging the Publication in hand thro' the Merits of his  Labours therein After which we have Verses in  Latin  and  English  upon the same and another Letter to him by his Friend  Thomas Brown  In his Preface to the Rea∣der we learn that the first Part of this Volume was the Work of  William Smith  long since  Rougedragon  Pursui∣vant at Arms and communicated to him by Mr  Ranulph Crew  Grandson to the Lord Chief Justice  Crew  in whose hands the Copy was left The second was the Work of Mr  William Webb  heretofore a Clerk in the Mayor's Court at  Chester  and this was imparted by that great Lover of Antiquities Sir  Simon Archer  of  Tanworth  in  Warwick∣shire  Both these Pieces relate purely to the County Pala∣tine of  Chester  The third touching the  Isle of Man  was written by Mr  James Chaloner  whose Abilities in histori∣cal Matters the Work itself will speak To all which are added by this Publisher several Prospects and other Pieces of Sculpture for the better Ornament of the whole as also thro' the help of some that were Wellwishers thereto A Translation of divers FoundationCharters with other things of good Note Then follows this Remark  "That there is no County in  England  more famous for a longcontinued Succession  of ancient Gentry  than this of  Chester  will not be denied nor any that can afford Materials with so little Trouble and Charge for the setting forth their  Descents  and memorable  Imployments  inso∣much as the Substance of all public Records meerly re∣lating thereto for almost Years are carefully pre∣served in the Castle at  Chester  and that the private Evi∣dences concerning the particular Families of that County are by reason of their long Duration less dispersed than those of many others be thro' the great and frequent Changes that have befallen them in most Places"  But our Publisher apprehensive belike that his Authors how∣ever they may have preserved many worthy Memorials had not made all the Advantage they might have done of those Records  "hopes therefore that these Essays of the Persons  abovementioned now coming to the View of the World will for the Reasons before express'd considering the Worthiness of the Subject stir up such whose greater Abi∣lities may by a more exact Survey and Search into the Antiquities of this Shire contribute further to its Honour by restoring to Light its ancient Glory for the more am∣ple Content of all Persons concerned therein and their own lasting Memory"  After this Preface we have the Publisher's Map of the County Palatine of Chester which Mr  Randolph Crew  had drawn with a Pen Then begins the Work under the Title of  The Vale Royal of England  with  a Catalogue of the Kings of Mercia  or  March  which Kingdom in the  Saxon Heptarchy  reached from  London  to the River of  Marsey  which parts  Cheshire  from  Lancashire  containing seventeen Counties and Part of two more This Catalogue contains Kings beginning  Anno    with  Crida  descended from  Woden  and ending in with Ceolwolph Next we have an Account gather'd as the former seems to have been from  Fox Holinshed Llhuyd Camden  c of  the Dukes and Earls of March  before the Conquest who were also Palatines of  Chester  for that it was a County Palatine before the Conquest appears in the  Supplication  here exhibited to King  Henry  VI by the Inhabitants there∣of and also that they were among other Privileges ex∣empted from the granting of Subsidies appears by that King's  Answer  thereunto Then we have a Confirma∣tion of the  Liberties  of the County Palatine by Queen  Elizabeth  with the Opinions of the Judges  Dier Weston Harper  and  Carns  concerning the Jurisdiction and Liberties of the said County Here we enter upon a par∣ticular  Description  of the County its Length about Miles Breadth about and Compass Miles Num∣ber of MarketTowns Parish Churches Longi∣tude Deg Min and Latitude Deg Min with the reason from its low Situation of its being named the ValeRoyal by King  Edward  I when he founded an Abbey in the midst of the Shire So we proceed to the Tempera∣ment of the Air the Fertility and Products of the Soil a∣mong which the  SaltWells  are not forgot lastly of their Buildings the Disposition of their People and their Man∣ner of Housekeeping Hence we pass to the Waters and their Courses beginning with the River  Dee  so of the  Marsey  the  Weaver  the  Dane Bollin Peever Wheelock  Taume  and the  Goit  with others mentioned by  John Le∣land  and  W Harrison  Thus we come to the Particulari∣ties of  Cheshire  that is the Divisions or  Hundreds  into which the County is distinguished and they are seven Of  Weral  the first here mentioned we have a Description from  Leland  and of  Helbrie  Island Then follow the Names of all the  Villages  and  Townships  in this Hundred So we go on to  Broxton  with a List of all the Townships therein the like of  Nantwich Edsbury Northwich Bulk∣ley  and  Maxfield  Here we have a brief Account of the Antiquity of the City of  Chester  from  Henry Bradshaw  and  Ranulph Higden  two Monks of that City and from  Holinshed  and  Harrison  and then a Map giving a Prospect of  Chester  the Ground Plot and Arms of the Earls since the Conquest Then we advance more particularly to the Longitude and Latitude of the City Descriptions of the Walls the Gates the Bridge the Castle CustomHouse ShireHall Exchequer and the Parish Churches in  Chester  Next of the Mayor Aldermen Sheriffs CommonHall the  Pendice  the  Rows  the Mercer's  Row  and Conduits Then of the Bishoprick of  Chester  The Division of  Mer∣cia  into five Bishopricks The Names of the Bishops of  Chester  since the Beginning of King  Henry  VIII MarketTowns in  Cheshire  The Manner of making Salt at  Nant∣wich  and at  Northwich  After that short Account of the MarketTowns and some others of principal Note and a Reference to the Map for the rest not named here we have the Genealogy of the Earls of  Chester  since the Con∣quest wherein is briefly shewed some Part of their Deeds beginning with  Hugh Lupu    and ending with  Edward  the  Black Prince  who was the eleventh Earl After these fol∣lows a Note of the chief Places of Gentlemen in  Cheshire  from  John Leland  and next the Names of all the  Knights Esquires Gentlemen  and  Freeholders  in the County  Pala∣tine  of  Chester  and in what Hundred they dwell taking up about three Leaves and a half Then comes a List of all the  Mayors  and  Sheriffs  of  Chester  beginning ending about fourteen Leaves After this we have another List of the  Benefices  or Rectories and Vicaridges in the County with their  Valuations  from a MS in the Library of St  John  's College  Cambridge  Then comes the De∣scent of the Barons of  Haulton  Constables of  Chester  and a Sculpture representing  Beeston  Castle with the Castle and Town of  Haulton  also some  Latin  Verses upon  Beeston  Castle built by  Ranulph  third Earl of  Chester  from  Le∣land  with Translations of the last  Distich  from  Speed  and  Camden  and a Note of the Battle on  Blore  Heath  Anno  which with another Note touching the  Arms  of the Gentry in this County introducing eleven Pages of them represented in  Sculpture alphabetically  and a  Table  of the remarkable Passages in the foregoing Discourse finishes this Part of the  ValeRoyal  ascribed to  William Smith  by our Editor as aforesaid which besides the Sculptures takes up Pages  The other Part or Description of this  ValeRoyal  by  William Webb  M A and sometimes UnderSheriff to Sir  Richard Lee  begins with his Wishes that the Labours of Mr  John Norden  had been continued to the finishing of that Historical and Chronographical Description of the rest of the Shires of this famous Isle which he had begun in that of  Middlesex  also his Commendations of our Worthy Coun∣tryman Mr  John Speed  's Labours of the same nature At the End of this Introduction he gives us a summary Ac∣count for his more methodical Proceeding of what Mat∣ter he has chosen to treat and in what manner so enters upon a Description of the City and County Palatine of  Chester  and because  Broxton  in some sort contains or borders upon and almost encompasses the said City he first makes a short Survey of that  Hundred  then more par∣ticularly describes the City itself recites its Names re∣marks upon the ancient Foundations and Buildings thereof more as a Topographer than Antiquary tho' not wholly a∣voiding historical Observation where it will illustrate his Account as himself professes The Authors used in this Description are  Giraldus Cambrensis Peter Langtoft Ranulph Higden Harding Caxton Fabian Holinshed Stow Camden  and a manuscript Life of St  Werburg  in  English  Verse by  Henry Bradshaw  Monk of  Chester  out of whom he makes several Quotations and calls him their best Anti∣quary Then follows a Discourse of the Foundation and Endowment of the Abbey of St  Werburg  in  Chester  writ∣ten by  N N  with two Sculptures representing the GroundPlot of her Church and the Southern Prospect of it This holy Virgin appears to have been the Daughter of  Wulpher  King of  Mercia  who died  A Dom  She had the Com∣mand over the Monasteries of  Weedon Trentham Repton  and  Hambury  In her tender Years was professed under her Aunt  Andry  at  Ely  lived much at  Weedon  deceas'd at  Trentham  and was buried at  Hambury  but twice transla∣ted first from  Trentham  to  Hambury  about the Year af∣terwards to  Chester  about as the B and Chap of her  Life  aforesaid testify After which follow several mo∣numental Inscriptions in the Quire of the said Abbey and in St  Nicholas  Chapel for  William Downham  Bishop of  Chester  who died Dr  Geo Lloyd  Bishop of  Sodor  Dr  John Lloyd  a famous Civilian Sir  Geo Beverley  the famous Abbot  Simon Ripley  who died about Sir  W Gerrard  and in St  Mary  's Chapel Sir  Henry Troutbeck  round the Effigies of whose Body in compleat Armour is neatly wrought a Wreath of Trouts Here also was buried the late famous Citizen  Robert Brere∣wood  Alderman and thrice Mayor of  Chester  who was says our Author  "The happy Father of the learned  Edw Brerewood  of  Oxford  whose surpassing Progress in the Stu∣dies of all manner of Learning the University does yet and for ever will ring loud of and  Gresham  College in  London  where he was  Mathematical  Reader will to the World's end bewail the want of being deprived of him by an untimely Death before he had finished or taken Order for Preservation of such learned Labours as if they were published wou'd make the World be∣holden to  Chester  the Nurse of such a Father which begat such a Son"  Here are also recited several In∣scriptions of several other Mayors Aldermen  c  of the said City Then after some Observations upon the River  Dee  and the renewing of the Haven our Author gives us the Remainder of his Remarks upon  Broxton  Hundred taking notice all the way he travels along by the Towns and Lordships of the principal Seats or MannorHouses and by whom possessed or inhabited This is also his Course thro' the Hundred of  Nantwich  where we have a Recital of the FoundationCharter of  Cumbermere  Abbey in  Chester  founded  Anno  by  Hugh Malbanc  from the Annals of  Crocksdon  in the  Cotton  Library In this Hundred we have some Remarks upon the Excellency of their Cheese on their SaltPits or  Wiches  and a Sculpture of  Crew  Hall In the Hundred of  Northwich  our Author thinks the Ale of  Sandach  as worthy of Praise as Mr  Camden  does that of  Derby  and if that Ale got its Name from the old  Danish  word  Oel  as he says our Author knows not why this may not almost with as little Variation come from  Oil  being almost as substantial in handling He also remarks upon  the common Report of the Trees which are seen floating in  Bagmere  Pool above Water just before any Heir of the House of  Brereton  the Owner thereof dies but looks upon it as meerly accidental In  Eadsbury  Hundred we have the FoundationCharter of the Abbey of  Dernhall  in the County of  Chester  translated afterwards to the  ValeRoyal  given by  Edward  eldest Son of King  Henry  III in the th Year of his Reign also the said King  Henry  's Letters of Recommendation to all Abbots  c  in  England  for Books to be bestowed on the said Abbey also the Charter for Translation of the said Abbey to the  ValeRoyal  This Hundred he concludes with an Apology for passing over some old Prophecies some conceited Names of Trees MossPits Pools long Shoots of old Archers a Horse Race or two and the latter NewfoundWell because he sup∣poses his long Journey in this little Hundred has well nigh tired his Reader already In  Werall  Hundred when he comes to  Birket  Wood we have a Prospect in Sculpture of the Ruins of  Berkenhead  Abbey A Reference to the  Monasticon  fol with the Charter of  Hamon Massie  's Donation of the Church of  Bowdon  and another Charter of Power to the Monks of  Berkenhead  Thus he passes on as through the rest of the  Hundreds  giving Descriptions of the chief  Seats  all the way and Characters of the  Gentry  who possessed them till he arrives again at the famous City of  Chester  and here takes the Government with its Go∣vernours under Consideration so begins with a Narrative of the  Earls  of  Chester  and first of those four or five be∣fore the Conquest who were named  Edolf  from the Tes∣timony of  Ranulph Cestrensis  and  Fabian    Curson  accor∣ding to  John Harding  The famous  Leofric  whose Power Grandeur and charitable Works are celebrated by many Historians but the Story of his Wife  Godwina  or  Godiva  riding through the City of  Coventry  naked to ob∣tain the Franchisement of the City is suspected by our Au∣thor His Son  Algarus  But these two and much less  Jonas  mentioned in the Chronicle of  St Albans  or  Otho∣nel  are tho' allowed to have been Earls of  March  by Sir  John Fern  in his  Second Part of Lacie's Nobility  not rec∣koned to have been Earls of  Chester  but he thinks they are so mistaken to have been by their Residence or Abode in that City or thereabouts Here we enter upon the History of the Earls of  Chester  from the Conquest of whom there is more certain Record beginning with  Hugh Lupus  who was  the Son of  William  the Conqueror's Sister and we have a Sculpture representing the said Earl in Parliament with the Barons and Abbots of the County Palatine which  Hugh  having governed the Earldom Years died about In the like manner we have a Chapter apiece upon the six ensuing Earls ending with  John Scot  who died in without Issue King  Henry  III took the Earldom of Ches∣ter into his hands and it was thenceforward held by Princes of the Blood Royal of whom after a little Account of the Barons under the ancient Earls we have also a Cata∣logue down to Prince  Charles  This is followed with a Dis∣course of the  Ecclesiastical  State and Government in this County the Successions of the  Bishops  and with more certainty from the d of  Henry  VIII ending with Dr  John Bridgman  The next Chapter treats of the Govern∣ment of the County and City by the Officers or Princes who ruled here after the Earls down to King  James  I Then we have a Table of the Mayors and Sheriffs of  Chester  from to interspersed with little historical Me∣moirs of some noted Occurrences happening under several Years within that Time and Place After this we have the Names of the Justices of  Chester  with another List of the Sheriffs of the County and the whole closes with a Copy from  Domesday  Book  sub Titulo Cestersheire  shew∣ing in whose Possession the Lands of this County were at the Conquest So ends this second and more copious Nar∣rative of the said County Palatine containing Pages and has an  Index  like the former at the End of it  But here follows another Tract not before spoken of in either of the TitlePages before the Book or in the Editor's Preface not being communicated perhaps till they were printed and it is called  Chronicon Cestrense  written by  Samuel Lee  as appears at the End of his Epistle to the said Editor his ingenious Friend Mr  D King  dated  May  In this Epistle perceiving the exact Times of the former Rulers of that Province not so much attended as might illustrate that  ValeRoyal  he desired to communicate to Pa∣per what he has observed in his Reading which might conduce to the fixing of the Times and Seasons wherein the noble Atchivements of its Rulers and Inhabitants have been performed And indeed he has shew'd himself more critically acquainted with all our ancient Historians as to Time and Place the two Eyes of History than both the foregoing Authors put together His Work begins with a  Chapter upon the Romans in  Cheshire  in which we have the various Opinions of several Authors concerning its Longitude and Latitude but he prefers  Shakerley  in his  British Tables  before all the rest Then we have in Chap∣ter the Kings Dukes and Earls of  Mercia  with the particular Earls of  Chester  from the Conquest and those of the Royal Blood disposed in their exact Times in five se∣veral Sections The third Chapter treats of the Bishops of  Mercia  who had their Seats sometimes at  Coventry  some∣times at  Chester  most commonly at  Litchfield  and there∣fore are usually so stiled but had  Cheshire  under their Epis∣copal Government Also of the Bishops of  Chester  since the Conquest and of the peculiar Bishops of  Chester  from the Time of King  Henry  VIII in four Sections The fourth and last Chapter discourses of the Parliamentary Barons of the Earls of  Chester  And first of the Barons Temporal in which we have the Stem of the Barons of  Haulton  lastly of the Barons Spiritual being an Account of the Earls Bi∣shops and Abbots But before we leave this Work where∣in the Author has proved himself so expert in calculating and fixing of ancient Times as to make us wish that  Saxon  History he promises in two or three Places had seen the light we shall only remark out of his second Chapter upon the  Mercian  Monarchy how he accounts for many Defects in our old historical Computations where he says  "Consi∣dering that all our Monkish Writers more skillful in num∣bering of Beads than Years did  uno tramite  follow the  Dionysian  Account a thing diligently to be attended in the reading of our  monastical  Writers I hope to extricate myself out of these Difficulties by treating a little of it be∣fore I begin with the Reigns of the Kings of  Mercia  "  Then having given an Example to shew wherein that Ac∣count is deficient and Direction to several Authorities for Confirmation thereof he further  "refers this to be proved more at large in its proper Place when he treats about the  Saxons  Arrival into our Land demonstrating their Entrance to have been in the Vulgar Year of Christ and not in or as our old Authors usually fix'd it whereby great and knotty Difficulties have tied up the History of the  Saxon  Dominion in this Island"  Thus much of this Chronological Treatise containing Pages We come now lastly to  A short Treatise of the Isle of Man  c illustrated with several Prospects of the Island by  D King  'Tis  dedicated to  Thomas  Lord  Fairfax  Lord of  Man  and of the Isles by the Author  James Chaloner  one of the Com∣missioners for settling Affairs in that Island who dates his said Epistle from  MiddlePark Dec  wherein it ap∣pears he was the rather induced to present the same to his Lordship because of his Respect to Antiquities so signally manifested in patronizing our notable  English  Antiquary Mr  Roger Dodsworth  in his Collections composing and pub∣lishing of that singular Piece his  Monasticon  c The Work is divided into six Chapters which after a Map of the Island environ'd with little Prospects of some notable Parts or Places in it begins with the Situation of the  Isle of Man  Concerning the Inhabitants whence derived their Lan∣guage the  Manks  Tongue and of the Translation of the Bible therein and of the Conditions of the People Of the State Ecclesiastical of the Bishops Monasteries and FreeSchools with three Prospects in Sculpture of  Balisaly  Abbey the Nunnery and the Bishop's Court Of the Civil Government and the supreme Governors particu∣larly King  Edward  II his Grant of the Island to  Henry  Lord  Beaumont  and here we have a Sculpture of the Arms of the  Beaumonts  Then the Author descends to the inferior Officers and the Judicatories of the said Isle The fifth Chapter is concerning the Trade of the Isle And the last Chapter is of the Strength of the Island where we have three Prospects in Sculpture of the Castle  Rushen Peel  Castle and  Douglas  Fort upon which Fortifications and others that might be wanting our Author concludes That the  Poverty  of the Island is its greatest  Security  The whole is no more than Pages followed with a Leaf of  Addenda Errata  and a Table of the true Longitude and Latitude of certain Cities in  England  which ends the whole Book  XXXIX  RELIQUIAE BODLEIANAE  Or some Genuine Remains of Sir  THOMAS BODLEY  containing his  LIFE the first  Draught  of the STATUTES of the PUBLIC LIBRARY at OXFORD in  English  and a  Collection  of LETTERS to Dr JAMES c  Publish'd from the  Originals  in the said Library  Octavo Pages  THESE  Remains  of that famous  Founder  of the  Public Library  at  Oxford  are pretty well known to have been published tho' their Editors Name appears not to them by the late Mr  Hearne  In his  Preface  after having touch'd up∣on the Antiquity of  Letters  and  Libraries  and shewn how ancient they were in  Egypt  what a magnificent Collection was made there by  Ptolemy  and what Ambition the  Greeks  and  Romans  had of this kind he descends to observe how early Learning flourish'd in  Britain  and that in King  Al∣fred  's Time there were divers Libraries for the Preserva∣tion of Learning but is more particular of  Richard de Bury  Bishop of  Durham  his noble Gift of Books to this Univer∣sity in as may be further gather'd from his own Ac∣count in his  Philobiblos sive de Amore Librorum  first prin∣ted at  Paris  afterwards at  Oxford  to and since in vo Also of  Thomas Cobham  Bishop of  Worcester  's Build∣ing for a Library in the said University in That after this another Library was built there by Duke  Humphrey  and famous in which falling to Ruin towards the end of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign Sir  Thomas Bodley  a second  Ptolemy  began to restore it in finish'd it in two Years and in a few more so nobly endow'd it with Books Re∣venues and other Buildings that it is accounted one of the  most famous Libraries in the World  excelling according to the Accounts of Travellers the  Vatican  at  Rome  that being so full of Corruptions and Forgeries The  History  of the  Bodleian Library  is given us by the  Oxford  Antiquary  An∣thony Wood  at large But the  Catalogue  of the Printed Books by Dr  Hyde  We have had one since also of the MSS but both being imperfect we are here told an  Appendix  to the former as big as the Doctors Catalogue was now ready for the Press and that an  Appendix  also to the latter was in some time to be publish'd yet are we still in expec∣tation of them The Editor likewise says 'Twas for the sake of this noble Library that lately in his searches there∣in finding the  Life  of Sir  Thomas Bodley  the first Draught of its  Statutes  and a Collection of his Letters to Dr  James  the first  Keeper  of it all written by Sir  Thomas  his own Hand he took a Transcript of them and sent them to the Press that others imitating Sir  Thomas  his Zeal and In∣dustry for the good of Learning might become Benefactors themselves to such a noble Repository which they cou'd not do at a better time since the  Act  of  Parliament  for sending certain Copies thither of Books printed at  London  was expired The  Life  he says has been printed some Years before and two Letters to Sir  Francis Bacon  lately at the end of Archbishop  Usher  's Letters but the Copies of the former being dispersed and the latter containing Mat∣ter of Moment it was thought fit to reprint them  In the LIFE  of Sir  THO BODLEY  written by himself  con∣sisting of Pages he tells us he was born at  Exeter  in  De∣vonshire  the d of March of Worshipful Parents That his Father a known Enemy to Popery fled in Queen  Mary  's Reign into  Germany  sent for his Family and settling at  Geneva  when our Author was twelve Years of Age had him instructed in  Hebrew  and  Greek  by  Chevalerius  and  Beroaldus  and in Divinity by  Calvin  and  Beza  besides Do∣mestic Teachers In the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign they return'd to  London  and he was sent to com∣plete his Studies at  Oxford  where he took his Batchelor of Arts Degree and was chose Probationer of  Merton  College in and the Year after admitted Fellow In read the  Greek Lecture  Proceeded Master of Arts and read for that Year  Natural Philosophy  was elected one of the Proctors in Supply'd for a long time the Place of  University Orator  Travell'd into  Italy France  and  Germany  to acquire the Modern Tongues in In was sent by the Queen to several  German  Princes to procure their Aid for the King of  Navarre  Also to  Hen∣ry  III of  France  both for this King's Advantage and that of the  Protestant  Cause In was sent to the  Hague  and there admitted one of their Council of State and acquitted himself in his Charge so much to the Queen's Satisfaction that thenceforward he rarely received any  Instructions  in  these Proceedings of State After his return from near five Years Foreign Employment he was sent to the  Hague  again but return'd in less than a Year Yet was no sooner come home but the Queen pleas'd with his Discoveries sent him again to the  States  with Charge to pursue what he had secretly propos'd whereby all was brought to the Issue desir'd In all which Employments he had no one more to his Friend among the Lords of the Council than the Treasurer  Burghly  who was of Opinion there was no Man so sit for the Office of Secretary of State and whose Intention was when he advanced his own Son thereto to make Sir  Thomas  his Collegue But before he return'd from the  United Provinces  in the Earl of  Essex  in Opposition to the  Cecils  had so prodigally recommended his Sufficiency to the Queen for the Post aforesaid that she who hated the Earl's Ambition was not the readier to prefer him tho' they were to be jealous of him Thus finding his Preferment on this Quarter obstructed and considering what a slender hold∣fast the Earl had with the Queen withal his declining Years and the easy Circumstances of his own Fortune he resolv'd to retire and tho' he had afterwards both in the Queen's Reign and King  James  's many honourable Invitations as well to Foreign as Domestic Employments he concluded at last  to set up his Staff at the Library Door in Oxon  and ac∣commodate that ruin'd Place for the Public Use of Stu∣dents finding himself competently furnish'd with the fourfold Aid necessary thereto which was a Knowledge in the Learn∣ed and Modern  Tongues  as well as sundry kinds of Scho∣lastic Literature a  PurseAbility  Store of Honourable  Friends  and  Leisure  to follow the Work But how well he has sped he thinks that which is already perform'd in sight that which besides he has given for the Maintenance of it and which he afterwards purposes to add will so abundantly testify that he needs not be the Publisher of the Worth of his own Institution Written  c  Signed  T B  Then follows  Sir THOMAS BODLEY's  first Draught of the  STATUTES  of the  PUBLICK LIBRARY  at  OXON  transcribed  from the  Original  Copy written by his own  Hand  and reposited in the  Archives  of the said  Library  Herein upon the Consi∣deration that no Institution can have the good Effects in∣tended unless there be Statutes to encounter and restrain the Disorders of illaffected Persons it is ordain'd by the Chan∣cellor ViceChancellor Doctors Proctors Masters Re∣gents  c  of the great Convocation of the University upon their frequent Consultation with Sir  Thomas  That some one be deputed to the keeping of this Library who is a diligent Student Trusty Active and Discreet a Graduate

Shillings except  Sunday Christmasday  and some others here named But to come constantly to the opening of the Library Doors and give access to others from Eight to Eleven in the Morning and Two till Five in Afternoon from  Easter  to  Michaelmas  but the rest of the Year from One to Four in the Afternoon a WarningBell to be rung at his Ingress and Egress None to enter by Night with Candle Lamp  c  Next of the care to be taken by Students in reading the Books fastning the Clasps and Strings untangling the Chains and leaving the Volumes in the Places they found them And for the smaller Volumes within the Grates and under the Custody of the Keeper a∣lone he is to deliver them out by Hand and Tale and with Condition that they be perused in sight and presently re∣stor'd to him or his Assistant

and Credit than o∣ther Students is to have besides the Annual Stipend of  Nobles  which was the Donation of King  Henry  IV issuable from the University Treasure Pounds Shillings and Pence and to be paid halfyearly out of the Library Re∣venue and his Assistant Ten Pounds and Four Pounds more to a poor Scholar or Servant for sweeping wiping  c  The choice of these to be at the Keeper's Discretion their Payment at the ViceChancellor's care and displacing of them in the power of the Overseers That for the safer Cu∣stody of the Revenue aforesaid it shou'd be lock'd up where the University Rents are kept in an Iron Chest under three different Locks with double Keys to remain with the ViceChancellor and two Proctors which last two are to be Witnesses of the Sums brought in or taken out and

all former Acts and Decrees expound alter abrogate or innovate and provide in all Events for the Indemnity of the Library as for a Treasure to Students of incomparable Worth So we come to  The LETTERS which are in Number and mostly written by Sir  Thomas Bodley  himself from  London Ful∣ham  and  Burnham  to Dr  Thomas James  the first Keeper of his Library Few of them have the Date of the Year when written but the earliest Date we meet with is in to Dr  Rives  ViceChancellor of  Oxon  about open∣ing the Library and constituting the Statutes thereof there∣fore perhaps shou'd have stood the first in this Collection and the latest is dated in Though one towards the end without any Date was written much sooner than the former being to his Cousin  Francis Bacon  when he was a Youth in  France  containing Advice to him in his  Travels  and the last Letter in the Book is written to Dr  James  by  Laurence Bodley  after the Death of his Brother Sir  Thomas  which was in Except another Letter from Sir  Tho∣mas Bodley  to the said Sir  Francis Bacon  which is also some∣what Foreign to these Collections as containing both a Cen∣sure and Commendation of some Maxims of Modern Philo∣sophy in his  Novum Organum  that which the Reader is to look for in these Letters might be sorted and compre∣hended under these five Topics The  Founder  the  Bene∣factors  the  Books  the  Library  and the  Librarian  But we for the Reader's Facility of finding the Particulars here  extracted shall give a transient View of the most observable among them in the same Order as they occur which tho' in the Collection itself short dissever'd often repeated and unconcluded in many Points as the Nature is of Occa∣sional Letters in such familiar Intercourse yet may yield many Historical Hints relating to the Encouragers of this Foundation or the manner of collecting and preserving the Writings of Learned and Ingenious Men  Such therefore are the  Founder's  Expostulations with his  Librarian  upon his sudden thoughts of a married Life the same being utterly deny'd also concerning the Advantages he had of improving his  Knowledge  and the Opportunities there might be of

pro∣mis'd divers MSS out of St  Augustine  's Library in  Canter∣bury  The Founder's Supposal that there are not to be had Twenty Pounds worth of the Books of Protestant Writers which he has not

Founder's Caution to avoid Censure His Considera∣tions about the RegisterBook Some mention of the Earl of  Essex  's Gift and Sir  Robert Sidney  's and Mr  Barkham  's The Founder's Opinion that there shou'd be no Vacation at all in the Library but that the Keeper being absent up∣on urgent Occasions another might supply his room till he return in regard of the Time good Students wou'd lose A reason for binding sundry Authors together that the mul∣tiplicity of Chains might not take away the sight and shew of the Books The Earl of  Southampton  's Gift of an Hun∣dred Pounds to the Library The Founder's Character of himself as to matters of Literature in these Words  "As touching your TitlePage and your Epistle I am no Judge for you to build on For in my own Writings I am altogether negligent and in censuring other Men's some∣what too curious"  Some notice of Dr  Reynolds  his Gift and of some Books from  Windsor  but if not to be had with∣out his Majesty's leave to let them

Manuscript Epistles of  Nazianzen  to Sir  Henry Savile  his Affection to the storing and preser∣ving of the Library being singular The Lord  Cranborn  's Gift of Fifty Pounds to the Library The Founder's Glad∣ness at the Assurance of his Librarian's Information that in  England  there are more Books to be found than are worth Five Hundred Pounds which are not in the Library  "For says he you shall never see that any good Books shall be lost for want of buying tho' I find no Contribu∣tors Albeit you need not doubt but I shall always find sufficient"  Further Expostulation with his Librarian a∣bout leaving his Charge and betaking to a private Course and about his engaging Sir  Thomas Lake  to obtain him two Prebends with Sir  Thomas  his Offer of Twenty Pounds ayear to be Chaplain in his House to the dislike of the Founder who cou'd not promote such Motions and thought that all  Promises  of Livings when they fall and  Letters  of Recommendation are to very small purpose unless they be follow'd and effected and tho' Sir  Thomas  cou'd procure many of those none of them all wou'd relieve him The Inscription upon Sir  Francis Vere  's Gift of Books this Year

Opi∣nion about the choice of a  Librarian  or his  Deputy  that he shou'd be one whose Person as well as Learning were to be liked in regard of the great Access of great Persons oftentimes of both Sexes therefore that he who attends upon them shou'd be a  personable Scholar  and qualified with a Gentlemanlike Speech and Carriage A Compu∣tation of the room to be allow'd for Books of Law and Phy∣sick and that the former Faculty will require five times more than the latter Notice of the King's Warrant for the choice of any Books in any of his Libraries The Er∣rors of the Librarian's  Hebrew  Words in his Catalogue  observ'd by the Founder and concerning the  Dedication  he says  "I do not mean the  King  as you supposed but the  Prince  for that to the King there are daily Books dedicated and for aught I can hear few Rewards be∣stowed whereof I do think you may have more hope at the Prince's hands by the means of good Friends"  Of the Founder's Speech for the Librarian to

King's coming Concerning  Buchanan  's Book against the Queen of  Scots  the Founder says  "it is in your Catalogue and it will not avail to conceal him in his Desk neither do I think that it will be thought on or if it be as yet we have no reason to take any Notice of the King's dislike"  The Founder's Conjecture that when those Books he has laid out for are brought in there will not be above Two Hundred New Books to be added yearly His Reasons against an Assistant Librarian or Deputy Dr  Abbot  Bishop of  Litchfield  solicites the Archbishop of  Canterbury  and the Bishop of  London  to bestow a Prebend upon the Librarian Mr  Thomas Allen  's Gift of  Greek  MSS and other Books The Founders Opi∣nion about buying new Editions of Books they already had His Preference of Sir  Henry

Exeter  his Addition of Twenty Pounds to his former Gifts Further Escapes noted in the Librarian's Catalogue of the  Hebrew  Books The Founder's Opinion for excluding Almanacks Plays and Numbers more daily printed hardly one in forty being worth keeping That in other Nations  Plays  may be more esteem'd for learning the Languages and being compiled by Men of Wis∣dom and Learning seldom the Case among us and tho' some little Profit might be reaped from some PlayBooks it will not countervail the Scandal they will bring on the Li∣bary when it shall be given out it is stuff'd with Baggage Books and that a few wou'd be multiply'd by such as pur∣pose to disgrace it Sir  H Savil  by what he has given and  purposes to give likely to prove the greatest Benefactor That Sir  Thomas Knevet  and Sir  Peter Young  dealt very much underhand to stop the King's Grant of Books The Founder's free Opinions of the Librarian's Work to prove the Corruptions of the Fathers His Censure of Dr  How∣son  's last

gave the Works of Sir  Thomas More  Mr  Hakewell  c men∣tion'd by the Founder His further Enquiries after Dr  Howson  and Opinion that he shou'd be severely censur'd and made to recant his malicious Taxation of those he terms  Glossers  or not suffer'd to hatch his newfangledness in the University His Orders for placing the Book which Mr  Co∣ryat  the famous Traveller writ and bestow'd on the Library in some such Place during the Act at which the Author was to be present as might seem to magnify both him and his Work The rest of this Collection consists only of the three Letters written by the Founder to Dr  Rives  and  Sir  Francis Bacon  and one by his Brother  Laurence Bod∣ley  to Dr  James  as was observed with their Purport in the beginning of this Extract thereof  XL  The  DIFFERENCE  between an  Absolute  and  Limited MO∣NARCHY  as it more particularly regards the  ENGLISH CONSTITUTION  Being a  Treatise  written by Sir  JOHN FORTESCUE  Kt Lord  ChiefJustice  and Lord  High Chancellor  of  ENGLAND  under  King HENRY VI  faithfully transcribed from the  MS  Copy in the  Bodleian  Library and collated with three other  MSS  Published with some  Remarks  by  JOHN FORTESCUEALAND  of the InnerTemple  Esq  F R S  vo  Pages Besides the Editor's Dedication and his Preface which contains Pages and a Table of Contents  The  MS  from which this Book was published and which is the fairest and most perfect remains among the  MSS  of Mr  Selden  in the  Bodleian  Library and appears to have been tran∣scribed by Sir  Adrian Fortescue  who was a Descendant from the Author and lived in the Reign of King  Henry  VIII for at the End it is thus written  Explicit Liber compilatus factus per  JOHANNEM FORTESCUE  Militem quondam Capitalem Justi∣ciarum  ANGLIAE  hic Scriptus manu propriâ mei  ADRIANI FORTESCUE  Militis  Of the  MSS  with which the E∣ditor collated this Work two are among the  MSS  of  Archbishop Laud  and Sir  Kenelm Digby  in the same Library and the third in the  Cotton  Library But all the material Variances are noted in the Margin of the Book    THIS most excellent Treatise was written by the Author in the Language of those Times in which he lived par∣ticipating much of the Nature of the  Saxon  And there∣in are used many Words Terminations and Phrases no where to be met with in the  Modern English  which may therefore seem uncouth and obsolete but by the  Etymolo∣gical Remarks  of the  Learned Editor  these seeming Impro∣prieties vanish and the Author appears with great Advan∣tage in his  Native Dress  The Editor in his  Dedication  to Sir  Thomas Parker  Knt Lord  ChiefJustice  of  England  having shewn the Office of  a  Judge  over the People of  England  that he is  Guardian  of their  Laws  and  Liberties  and  Mediator  between  Prince  and  Subject  extols the great Abilities and Integrity of the  Author  and of his  Patron  too and compliments Sir  Tho∣mas  with this beautiful Simile  "That your  Lordship  now appears with such a Lustre is in some measure owing to your  high Station  tho' the latent Cause existed long be∣fore So the  Sun  itself when rising shines only to the  East  but is the same with that which when elevated to the  Meridian  enlightens the whole  Hemisphere  "  He then opens his  Preface  to Sir  John Holland  Bart with the Grand Division of  Law  into  Divine  and  Natu∣ral  and shews that the  Law  of  England  comes nearest to the  Law  of  Nature  and the  Divine  Pattern Next he treats of its  Certainty  proving that  legal Beings  in general are capable of the best  Certainty  even Demonstration and Mr  Lock  's Notions of  Morality  applicable to them and after shews the special Care of the Law of  England  in defi∣ning Terms raising Axioms drawing Deductions there∣from searching the Truth of Facts by Juries of Men and giving Judgment upon mature Consideration Then of its Antiquity and here he cites our Author  de Laud Leg Angl  that neither the  Roman  nor  Venetian  Laws can claim so great Antiquity and lays down that all Laws have their  Origin  from  Nature  and those that are founded on her are equally ancient that the Law of  England  consists of the Laws of  Nature  positive  Institutions  and  Customs  That  Ethelbert  the first  Christian King  in with the Advice of his  WiseMen  made the first  Saxon  Laws after the coming of  Austin  the Monk and many  Saxon  Kings after him in like manner made and confirmed Laws that  Al∣fred  first sole Monarch after the  Heptarchy  with the Ad∣vice of his  WiseMen  collected the Laws of former  Saxon  Kings into one entire  Codex  suppos'd to be the same with the  DomeBook    ut in Jus Commune totius Gentis transiret  that his Successors  Edward  the Elder  Aethelstan Edgar Ethelred  and  Canutus  confirmed these Laws and com∣manded their Judges to give right Judgment according to the  DomeBook  and that the  FolcRight  should be preserv'd to all their Subjects And from hence the Editor concludes that the  Common Law  of  England  under the Name of  FolcRight  existed under  Alfred  and that  Edward  the Confes∣sor only collected as  Alfred  had done the Laws then extant which had not been observed during the Usurpations of  Harold  I and  Hardicanute  and may well be called the Re∣storer of the  English  Laws and this he backs with the Oath of  William  I to keep inviolable the Laws of the pious Kings of  England  and especially King  Ed∣ward  which says he were not only those enacted in his time but of all his Ancestors and the with Confirmation of King  Edward  's Laws by  Henry  I  Stephen Henry  II  Richard  I  John  and  Henry  III and  Magna Charta  which as Lord  Coke  ob∣serves is only a Confirmation of the  Common Law  of  Eng∣land  He then speaks of the  Salic  Laws among the  German Franks  and briefly of the  English  Constitution After∣wards he passes to the Author's Life and Character his Pe∣digree and Works Then follows the Reason of his Re∣marks on the Author's Language and here he observes that  "tho' an  Etymology  strictly speaking is no more than a Derivation of the Word or Name yet  Etymologies  from a  Saxon  Original will often present you with a Definition of the thing in the Reason of the Name"  And this he illustrates with many remarkable Instances he likewise gives the  Etymology  of several  LawTerms  particularly  By this word  Witkernam  Sir  Thomas More  once gain'd no small Honour for being at  Bruges  in  Flanders  an arrogant Fellow set up a  Thesis  that he would answer any Question that should be propounded to him in what Art soever Sir  Thomas  made this Question to be put to him whether  Averia capta in Witherna∣mia sunt irreplegibilia  adding that there was one of the  English  Ambassador's Retinue that would dispute it with him The  Thraso  not so much as understanding those  Terms  of our Com∣mon Law knew not what Answer to make and so became ri∣diculous to the whole City Life of Sir  Thomas More    vo    Wither∣nam Heriot Husting Murder Homicide  c and of the Words  King  and  Queen  and several others which come from  Saxon  Originals He then shews the Use nay neces∣sity of the knowledge of the  Saxon  Tongue in almost all Sciences And gives an account of Books proper for at∣taining it and to that end is the rest of the Preface  We come now to the Work itself consisting of XX Chapters Chap I Contains the difference between  Do∣minium Regale Dominium Politicum Regale  II The Reason of this Difference III The Fruits of these diffe∣rent Governments

Alphabet  XLI  The Antiquities and Practice of the  COURT  of  EXCHEQUER MS Quarto Pages  THUS the better to understand the Contents of this Work is its Title here enlarged which otherwise is no more than barely  Exchequer  as if it were a Part of some larger Performance which had a more comprehensive and explanatory Title at the beginning And this we are the ra∣ther inclin'd to believe was the Case in that we have been inform'd the late Lord Chief Baron  Gilbert  wrote Two Dis∣courses upon the Courts of the  King'sBench  and the  CommonPleas  and a Third upon the  Exchequer  of which last this before us is presumed to be a Copy It was certainly wrote by an Author who was familiarly acquainted with the Laws of this Court or Course of Practice therein both Ancient and Modern and that it was written since Mr  Maddox  pub∣lish'd the  History of the Exchequer  appears by our Author's frequent Quotations from it besides there is the Form of a Writ of  Scire Facias  issued under the  Teste  of the said Chief Baron  Gilbert  in the fourth Year of his late Majesty's Reign recited in the th Page of the said MS which was imparted to us out of the Collections mention'd in our Account of the MS we described in our last Number  It is divided into Ten Chapters which for want of room we shall only repeat as follows Shewing that the  Exchequer  was the ancient and sovereign Court in  Normandy  How to understand the Revenue and Business of the ancient  Ex∣chequer  How when  Baronies  towards the latter end of the Norman Period escheated they were wont to be broken in∣to small Tenures That in the  Saxon  Times the Lords Spi∣ritual held by  Frank Almoigne  How the King's Tenants who held  per Baroniam  did Suit and Service at his own Court How all Debts to the King bind from the Time they are contracted What Acts and Instruments pass by the King's Chancellor under the BroadSeal The usual Revenue which arose from Fines and Amerciaments The Receipt of the  Exchequer  The Sheriffs Accounts and with this concludes the Treatise at least as far as our Copy extends  The End of Number  IV  XLII  TULLIUS  his Book of  OLDE AGE  Whereunto is added his Book of  FRENDSHIP  and the Declaracyon shewing wherin  HONOURE  shold reste Translated into  Englyssh  by the  Erle  of  WORCESTER Enprynted by  William Caxton  Fol  THIS threefold Work is so sufficiently explained in the Prefaces and Conclusions of its several Parts that the Reader cannot have a better Account thereof than by a Recital of them We shall therefore begin with his Preface to the first Part which is as follows  "Here begynneth the Prohemye upon the reducynge both out of  Latyn  as of  Frensshe  into our  Englyssh  Tongue of the Polytyque Book named  Tullius de Senectute  which that  Tullius  wrote upon the Disputations and Commynyca∣cions made to the puissant Duc  Cato  Senatour of  Rome  by  Scipion  and  Lelius  then beyng yong noble Knyghtes and also Senatours of the said  Rome  of the Worshippe Recommendacyon and Magnyficence that shold be gyven to Men of olde Age for theyr Desertes and Experyence in Wysedom of polytyque Governaunce and blamed them that reproven or lothen olde Age and how  Caton  exhorteth and counseileth olde Men to be joyful and bere pacyently olde Age whan it cometh to them And how  Tullius  at reverence of  Caton  declareth by ways of Example how  Ennius  thauncyent Philosophre purposeth and wryteth in three Verses compendyously unto his Frende  Atticus  also a Senatour of  Rome  how he toke grete Thought and Charge for the Governaunce of the comyn Prouffyght for which he deserved grete Lawde and Honoure in preferring the same named in  Latin Res Publica  kepyng the  Romaynes  prosperous and defendyng them fro theyr Adversaryes and Rebelles Whiche Book was translated and thystoryes o∣penly declared by the Ordenaunce and Desyre of the noble auncyent Knyght Syr  Johan Fastolf  of the Countee of  Norfolk  Bannerette lyvyng the Age of fourscore Yere excercsyng the Warrys in the Royame of  Fraunce  and other  Countrees for the Diffence and unyversal Welfare of bothe Royames of  Englond  and  Fraunce  by forty Yeres endurying the Fayte of Armes hauntyng and in admynystryng Jus∣tice and polytique Governaunce under thre Kyngs that is to were  Henry  IV  Henry  V  Henry  VI and was Governour of the Duchye of  Angeou  and the Countee of  Mayne  Ca∣pytayne of many Townys Castellys and Fortressys in the said Royame of  Fraunce  havyng the Charge and Saufgarde of them dyverse Yeres ocupyeng and rewlynge thre hon∣dred Speres and the Bowes acustomed thenne and yeldyng good Acompt of the forsaid Townes Castellys and For∣tresses to the seyd Kyngs and to theyr Lyeutenauntes Prynces of noble Recommendacion as  Johan  Regent of  Fraunce  Duc of  Bedford Thomas  Duc of  Exeter Tho∣mas  Duc of  Clarence  and other Lyeutenauntes prayeng to take this reducyng pacyently and submittyng me to the Amendyng and Correction of the Reder and Understonder that is disposed to rede or have any Contemplacion in thistoryes of this Book whiche were drawn and compyled out of the Bookes of thauncyent Phylosophers of  Grece  as in thorygynal Text of  Tullius de Senectute  in  Latin  is spe∣cifyced compendyously which is in manner harde the Texte But this Book reduced in  Englyssh  Tongue is more ample emnowned and more swetter to the Reder kepyng the juste Sentence of the  Latyn  Thence for as moche as this Book thus reduced into our  English  is with grete Inst  ce Labour and Coste comen into myn honde which I advysedly have seen over redde and considered the noble honeste and vertuous Mates ne∣cessarily requysite unto Men stepte in Age and to yong Men for to lerne how they ought to come to the same to whiche every Man naturelly desyreth to atteyne And the Matter and Commynycacion of this said Book bytwene that wise and noble Man  Cato  on that one part and  Scipio  and  Lelius  two yonge Knyghtes on that other part is moch behoefful to be knowen to every Man vertuous and wel disposed of what some ever Eage resonable that he be Thenne by cause I have not seen ony of the same here to fore I have endevoured me to gete it with grete diffi∣culte and so gotten have put it in Enprynte and dilygent∣ly after my lytil Understandyng corrected it to thentente that noble vertuous and wel disposed Men myght have it to loke on and to understonde it And this Book is not re∣quysite ne eke convenyent for every rude and symple  Man which undestandeth not of Science ne Connyng and for suche as have not herde of the noble wise and grete Lords Gentilmen and Marchauntes that have seen and dayly been ocupyed in Maters towchying the publyque Weal And in especial unto them that been passed theyr grene Yongthe and eke their myddle Age called Virylyte and ben approchid unto  Senectute  callyd olde and auncyent Eage wherin they may see how to suffre and bere the same pacyently and what Surete and Vertue ben in the same And have also cause to be joyous and glad that they have escaped and passed the manyfolde Peryllys and doubte∣ous Adventures that ben in Juvente and Yongthe as in this said Booke here followyng ye may more plainly see Whiche Booke endyted and wrote in  Latyn  by the noble Philosopher and Prince of Eloquence  Tullius  Consul  Ro∣mayn  within the Breste of whom Phylosophye Naturel and Morall had chosen her Domicill Out of whiche it hath ben translated into  Frensh  and after into our  Englyssh  Tongue as hier after al a longe ye may see  Also whan the said  Tullius  had made his Book  De Senec∣tute  he aftir made another Book called  De Amicicia  that is to say of Frendship In which he reherceth of two yong Knyghtes of  Rome  that one named  Sevola  and that other  Faunyus  both Sonesinlaw unto  Lelius  a noble Senatour of  Rome  and felawe and alyed in Frendship with  Scipio Affrycan  whiche within fewe days to fore was deed How they desyred to knowe of the Frendship that was be∣tweene the said  Scipio  whyles he lived and  Lelius  theyr said Faderinlaw And of the Disputation in Frendship as also playnly it appiereth in the same which Book was translated by the vertuous and noble Erle therle of  Wur∣cestre  into our  Englyssh  Tongue And by cause it is ac∣cordyng and requysite to have Frendship joyned to olde Eage I have enprynted the said Book of Frendship and annexed to it the Book of Eage which Book of Frendship is full ne∣cessary and behoefful unto every Estate and Degree And aftir I have sette in this said Book followyng them bothe a Noble Treatys of the Declaracion of two noble Knyghtes  Romaynes  in makyng of two Oracions to sore the Senate to knowe wherin Noblesse resteth And thus this Volume is dyvyded into three particuler Werkes whiche ben of grate Wysdom in  old Age  very Love in  Frendship  and the Question wherin Noblesse resteth Which lytil Volume I have emprysed tenprynte under the Umbre and Shadowe  of the noble Protection of our moost dradde Soverayne and naturel Lyege Lord and moost Cristen Kyng Kyng  Ed∣ward  the Fourth to whom I moste humbly byseche to receyve the said Book of me  William Caxton  his moost humble

mayntene and graunte to him longe Lyf and prosperous and thaccom∣plishment of his hye and noble Desyres And aftir this short and transitorye Lyf everlastyng Lyf and Joye in Heven  Amen  "  After this general Preface follows a Table of the Heads in the first Part or Discourse of  Old Age  which being al∣most eight Leaves is too long to be here recited and much more any tollerable Abstract of the Discourse itself which extending as far as the Printer's Mark I for this Book has  Signatures  at the bottom of it though no  Numbers  on the Pages at top concludes with these Words  "Thus endeth the Boke of  Tulle  of Old Age translated out of  Latyn  into  Frenshe  by  Laurence de Primo Facto  at the Commandment of the noble Prynce  Lowys  Duc of  Burbon  and enprynted by me symple Persone  William Caxton  into  Englysshe  at the Playsir Solace and Reverence of Men growing into Olde Age the Day of  August  the Yere of our Lord "  To this is joined the Second Treatise be∣ginning with these Words  "Here foloweth the said  Tullius de Amicicia  translated into our maternall  Englysshe  Tongue by the noble famous Earl the Erle of  Wurcestre  Sone and Heyre to the Lord  Typtoft  which in his Tyme flowred in Vertue and Cun∣nyng to whom I knewe none lyke emonge the Lordes of the Temporalite in Science and Moral Vertue I byseche Almyghty God to have Mercy on his Sowle and praye all them that shall here or rede this lityl Treatys moch ver∣tuous of Frendship in like wise of your Charyte to remem∣bre his Soul emong your Prayers And by cause this Werke was made by the Prince of Eloquence  Tullius  intitled  De Amycicia  after that he had achevid his Boke  De Senectute  as hertofore ye may more playnly see at large thene me semeth it requisite and necessarye that I sette in folowing the said Book this Book  De Amicicia  which by Goddes Grace shal playnly folowe"  This Treatise is marked with  Signatures  in the same manner as the former that is to  say an alphabetical Letter repeated on every Leaf with a numerical Figure as far as four then four Leaves blank without any Signature so that this Treatise beginning at A and ending at D has Leaves in it and concludes in this manner  "Thus endeth this Boke named  Tullius de Amicicia  which treateth of Frendship uttered and de∣clared by a noble Senatour of  Rome  named  Lelyus  unto his two Sonesinlawe also Noble Men of  Rome  named  Faunyus  and  Sevola  In which they desyred him to en∣forme them of the Frendship that was betweene the said  Lelius  and the noble Prynce  Scipio Affrican  Wherin he hath answered and tolde to them the noble Vertues that be in Frendship and without Vertue veray Frendship may not be as he prevyth by many Exsamples and notable Con∣clusions as heretofore is moch playnly expressyd

this said Werke of your Charyte I beseche you to praye for hym And by cause this said Book  De Amicicia  is ful necessarye and requysite to be had and knowen I have put it in emprynte to thentent that veray Amyte and Frendship may be had as it ought to be in every Estate and Degree and Vertue without whiche Frendship may not be had may be encreaced and Vices eschewid Thenne whan I had enprynted the Book of Olde Age whiche the said  Tullyus  made me semed it acor∣dyng that this said Booke of Frendship shold folowe by cause ther cannot be annexed to olde Age a bettir thynge than good and very Frendship which two said Bokes here to fore wreton ben of grete Wisdom and Auctoryte and full necessarye behoeffull and requysite unto every Age Estate and Degree And that they prouffyte in encrecyng of Vertue I beseche the blessyd Trynyte to geve and graunte unto alle them that shal rede and here thise Bokes and so to flee and eschewe Vices and Synnes that by the Merytes of vertuose honeste and good Werkes we may atteyne aftir this shorte transytorye Lif the eternall bles∣syd Lif in Heven where is Joye and Glorye withoute ende  Amen  "  Lastly follow the Two  Declarations  made by  Publius Cornelius Scipio  and  Gayus Flamyneus  Competitors for the Love of  Lucresse  shewing wherein  True Honour and No∣bleness consists  The former placing it in Blood Riches  and the worshipful Deeds of his Ancestors without urging any thing of his own Life or Manners the latter insisting that Nobleness cannot be derived from the Glory or Merits of another Man or from the flattering Goods of Fortune but must rest in a Man's own proper Virtue and Glory After these Orations which with the Argument or Intro∣duction take up nineteen Leaves the whole Book is con∣cluded by our Editor in these Words  "Here I make an ende of this Mater for this tyme prayeng and requyryng all theym that in this said Werke shal have ony Playsyre that ye wil remembre hym that translated it into our Maternal and

BERTHELET  cum privilegio ad im∣primendum solum    o  Leaves besides Ta∣bles c  THIS Sir  Thomas Elyot  for his Learning and vertuous Accomplishments was an Honour to the Gentry and Nobility of  England  in his Time and tho' his younger Years were much employed in Court and State Affairs es∣pecially certain Embassies into  Italy c  yet did he apply the Knowledge thereby acquired rather to the Improvement and Communication of his Studies than to the more fa∣shionable Attainments of worldly Riches Offices and Dignities He is said by  Bale  to have been the Son of Sir  Richard Elyot  and born in  Suffolk  but his chief House and Estate was at  Carleton  in  Cambridgeshire  of which County we find him in the List of High Sheriffs in the and th of  Henry  VIII and at which Town he was buried in having a handsome Monument over his Grave His Works partly original Compositions partly Translations from  Greek  and  Latin  are all upon grave and important Subjects They need not upon this occasion be here enumerated being at least a Dozen in number  which perhaps in little more than so many Years he set forth in the  English  Tongue whereof his  Dictionary  is not the least considerable But we may here observe that the Accounts which have hitherto been given of them are very imperfect especially that of  Anthony Wood  As to this Book named the  Governour  we find it to be the first he published and it has been so well received as to have had as many if not more Editions than any other of his Wri∣tings This Edition we make use of is not mentioned in the Author last quoted and its having the Date of in the ornamental Border from a wooden Print in the TitlePage gives room to conjecture the Book was first printed that Year  It is dedicated by the Author to King  Henry  VIII and in his said Proheme or Dedication he has these Words which verify in part what we have above observed and at the same time shew you the subject Matter of his Work  "I have now enterprysed to discribe in our Vulgare Tonge the Forme of a just publike Weale which Mattier I have gathered as well of the Saiyings of most noble Autors  Greekes  and  Latines  as by myne owne Experience I being continually trained in some daielye Affaires of the publicke Weale of this your most noble Realme almost from my Childhood which Attemptate is not of Presump∣cion to teache any Person I myself having most nede of teachyng but only to the entent that Men which will be studious about the Weale publyque may find the thynge thereto expedient compendiously written And for as muche as this presente Boke treateth of the Education of them that hereafter maie be deemed woorthy to be  Go∣vernours  of the publike Weal under your Highnesse which  Plato  affirmeth to be the first and chief Parte of a Publike Weal  Solomon  saiynge also where Governours be not the People shall falle into ruine I therefore have named it the  Governour  and do now dedicate unto youre Hyghe∣nesse as the fyrst Fruits of my Study  c  "  After the Table of Contents our Author enters upon his Work which is divided into Three Books with explaining the Signification of a Publick Weal and why it is called in  Latin Respublica  giving the Reason of Government and shewing why Man for his Understanding and the Honour which is due to it is best fitted for the same Further that one Sovereign Governor ought to be in a Publick Weal and what Damage hath happened when a Multitude has had  equal Authority without any Sovereign This is il∣lustrated by many Examples especially from our own Hi∣story of the  Saxon  Invasion and Divisions of this Kingdom till it was reduced to its primitive Estate by the noble King  Edgar  But here not proposing to describe the Office or Duty of a  Sovereign  Governor he distinguishes his In∣tention to treat of the two Parts of a Publick Weal named due  Administration  and necessary  Occupation  which shall be divided into two Volumes  "In the first saith he shall be comprehended the best Form of Education or bryng∣ing up of noble Children from their Nativitie in such manner as thei may be found worthy and also able to be Governours of a Publyke Weale The second Volume which God grantyng me Quietnese and Libertee of Minde I will shortly after sende forth It shall conteyn all the Remenant which I can either by Learnyng or Experience find apt to the Perfection of a just Publike Weale in which I shall so endeavour myself that all Men of what Astate or Condicion soo ever thei bee shall fynde therin Occasion to be alwaie vertuously occupied and not without pleasure yf they be not of the Schools of  Aristippus  or  Apitius  of whom the one supposed Feli∣citee to bee onely in Lecherye the other in delicate Feedynge and Gluttonye from whose sharpe Talones and cruelle Teethe I beseeche all gentyll Readers to defende these Warkes which for theyr Commoditee is only compiled"  Then he proceeds to observe in the third Chapter That in a Publick Weal there ought to be inferior Governors called  Magistrates  which should be appointed or chosen by the Sovereign Governor In the next Chap∣ter he treats of the  Education  or Form of bringing up the Children of Gentlemen which are to have Authority in the Publick Weal so proceeds to the Order of  Learning  that Noblemen in their Minority should be trained to and at what Age  Tutors  should be provided and what belongs to their Office In what wise  Musick  may be necessary to a Nobleman The Commendation of  Painting  and Carv∣ing in a Gentleman The exact Care required in chusing of  Masters  The Order to be used in Learning and which Authors to be first read The Reasons why Gentlemen at this time be not equal in Doctrine to the ancient Noblemen which are Pride Avarice and Negligence of Parents with the want or scarcity of sufficient Masters or Tutors Here we have a Character of  Henry Beauclerk  King of  England  and his Brothers Also a Commendation of  Eloquence  and of  Poetry  with Translations of some Verses from the ancient Poets shewing what good Advice even the wanton Wri∣ters often contain and that it were no Reason for some little matter that is in their Verses to abandon therefore all their Works  "No wise Man entreth into a Gardein sais our Author but he soon espieth good Herbes from Net∣tils and treadeth the Nettils under his fete whiles he gadreth good Herbes whereby he taketh no damage or if he be stungen he maketh light of it and shortly forgetteth it Semblably if he do rede wanton Metter myxte with Wisedome he putteth the worst under fote and sorteth out the best or if his Courage be stered or provoked he remembreth the litteil Pleasure and great Detriment that shulde ensue of it and withdrawyng his Mynde to some other Study or Exercise shortly forget∣teth it"  From hence we pass to the  Law  and some Observations upon the Improvements to be made in the Study thereof The Cause why at this day there be in this Realm so few perfect  SchoolMasters  Sundry Forms of  Exercise  mentioned as necessary for every Gentleman some of which are referred to in  Galen's  Book  De Sanitate tuenda    "which is translated into  Latine  wonderfull elo∣quently by Dr  Linacre  late most woorthy Phisicion to our Most Noble Soveraigne Lord Kyng  Henry  VIII"  And those mentioned are  Wrestling Running Swimming  Art of  Defence Riding  and  Vaulting  and here speaking of  Horses  he sais  "It is supposed that the Castle of  Arun∣del  in  Sussex  was made by one  Beauvize  Erl of  South∣ampton  for a Monument of his Horse named  Arundell  which in far Countries hadde saved his Maister from ma∣ny Perils"  Then we come to the ancient  Hunting  of the  Greeks  and  Romans  also of  Hawking  and next of  Dancing  shewing that it is not all in general to be re∣proved The Antiquity of Dancing and wherefore in the good Order of Dancing a Man and Woman dance toge∣ther How Dancing may be an Introduction to the first moral Virtue called Prudence Of the Motions in Danc∣ing and what they are called as the  Honour  the  Braul  with an Explanation of the word  Maturity  the  Singles  and  Reprinse  or Indication of Circumspection which gives our Author an Opportunity under that Consideration to deliver a laudatory Character of King  Henry  VII Other Branches of Prudence are also further describ'd from other  Motions or Steps in Dancing This ends with a Criticism on the words  Modesty  and  Discretion  not hitherto known in the English Tongue and of the word  Mansuetude  till this time also unknown in our Tongue with Reasons for na∣turalizing Words from the  Romans  as they did from the  Gre∣cians  Hence we pass to other Pastimes expedient if mode∣rately used Here  Dicing  is shrewdly censured its ill Conse∣quences expos'd and the vicious Motives to it with Ex∣amples how contemptible it was held by the Ancients  Cards  and  Tables  are more favourably censured as depend∣ing more on Wit and trusting less in Fortune especially were such Improvements made in these kinds of Gaming that Knowledge or Science in higher things might thereby be advanced delightfully and so as to tender Study most commodious whether in military Contentions or those between Virtue and Vice or any other laudable Invention To this end is the Game of  Chesse  commended and as most pleasant to those Players at it who have read the  Moralization  of it and think thereof in their Play which Book is in  English  but very scarce because few in their Play seek for Virtue or Wisdom Thus we come to  Shoot∣ing  in the LongBow which he commends as the principal of all other Exercises not only for being more moderate but more serviceable having been our best Defence and made us most victorious fam'd and fear'd as may be seen in the Histories of King  Richard  I and King  Edward  I Hence our Author takes occasion to exclaim against the Decay of Archery in his Time and the Neglect of putting in Execution those Laws and Provisions which were made for restoring the same And here he concludes the first Book containing Chapters and Leaves  The  Second  Book begins with laying down such virtuous  Admonitions  as should be premeditated by whomsoever is appointed a Governor of a Publick Weal with some Ex∣amples produced to prove that as the Governor is such is the People and more refer'd to in  History  the Readers of which our Author most desires should be of all others Princes and Governors Those Admonitions our Author would have delectably written and set in a Table within the Governor's Bedchamber with those Verses of  Claudian  to the Emperor  Honorius  added which he has here trans∣lated and of which we shall give our Reader only this Taste  What thou  mayst  do delight not for to know  But rather what thing will  become  thee best  Embrace thou Vertue keep thy Courage low  And think that always Measure is a Feast  And just before  If Lust or Anger do thy Mind assail  Subdue Occasion thou shalt soon prevail  Then proceeds he to the Exposition of  Majesty  which he calls  "The Fountain of all excellent Manners the whole Proportion and Figure of noble State and is properly a Beauty or Comeliness in Countenance Lan∣guage and Gesture apt to his Dignity and accommodate to Time Place and Company which like as the Sun doth his Beams so doth it cast on the Beholders and Hearers a pleasant and terrible Reverence"  c  Next we have his Judgment and Advice about the  Apparel  fit for a Nobleman who is a Governor or great Counsellor also concerning the  Furniture  of his House the Definition or Description of true  Nobility  and whence it took its Deno∣mination in which Chapter he has this Allusion  "We have in this Realm Coynes which be called  Nobles  as long as thei be sene to be Golde thei be so called but if thei be counterfeited and made in Brass Coper or o∣ther vile Mettall who for the Print onely calleth theim  Nobles  wherby it appereth that the Estimation is in the Mettall and not in the Print or Figure"  Hence he proceeds to the Praise of  Affability  and the Use thereof in every State more particularly in the Facility of Address or being spoken to with Examples of the dismal Condition of a Prince and his Realm where Liberty of  Speech  is restrain'd The notable Virtue of  Placability  is also here illustrated and here he gives us at large a domestick Example of this Vir∣tue comparable with the best that ever was recorded of any other Princes or People in the notable Story of King  Henry  the IV his Thanksgiving to God upon hearing that the  Prince of Wales  afterwards our renowned King  Henry  V was committed to Prison and the Reason thereof in that he was bless'd with such a  Judge  as feared not to ad∣minister and such a  Son  as scorned not to obey  Justice  Sir  Thomas Elyot  quotes no Authority for this curious Story and I recollect not any more ancient than his own in this Book  John Speed  in his  Chronicle  quotes it from this Place And Dr  Fuller  tho' he misquotes our Author as if it were from Sir  T Elyot  's Chronicle for no such Book did he ever publish yet seems rightly to add  "from whom our modern Historians have transcribed it"  Shakespear  in the second Part of his  Henry  IV has made a lively Scene of it for the Stage and enlarged it with Circumstances as a Dramatist has a License to do But  Stow  's Computation of the time which the  Chief Justice  con∣cerned in this Story sat on the Bench is observed to have been too much contracted and  John Trussel  's Account of King  Hen∣ry  the V his Acknowledgment of the said Judge's Justice as if he were alive after the Coronation of that King is observed not to agree with the time of the said Chief Justice's Death For Sir  William Gascoigne  was this Judge who committed Prince  Henry  to Prison and he was made Chief Justice of the King'sBench in the first of  Henry  IV according to  Fuller  as he assures us from our authentic Records or of  November  which was of that King according to  Dugdale  and died on the th of  December  in the th or last Year of that King which was in according to the Date on his Monument in  Harwood  Church in  Yorkshire  and the Pedigree of his Fa∣mily still in being What confirms the Truth of this Story here abovemention'd is That there is a Medal struck in Com∣memoration thereof an Impression of which I have seen It is not so broad as a Guinea has his Name written round it in the old  English  Characters with the Image of himself I suppose sitting on a Bench by another Person and reading to three Au∣ditors before him Mr  J Hopkinson  in his MS Volume of the  Pedigrees of the Yorkshire Gentry  has given us a Specimen of this Name's being spell'd more variously than any other I ever met with It is upon the said Medal Sir  Wylliam de Gasquone  as I remember but has since been most generally written  Gas∣coigne  tho'  Fuller  who was acquainted with an accomplished Antiquary in  Recordheraldry  of the same Family and Sur∣name writes him  Gascoinge  From hence we pass to Arguments and Examples shewing  that a Governor ought to be merciful with the difference between  Mercy  and vain  Pity  Here we have the choice Example of Mercy shewed by the Emperor  Augustus  to his Enemy  Lucius Cinna  from  Seneca  Then he descants upon the other principal Parts of Humanity the Excellency of  Benevolence Patience Charity  adorn'd with many anci∣ent Examples Of  Beneficence Liberality  and  Prodigality  The true Description of  Friendship  The wonderful History of  Titus  and  Gisippus  whereby is fully declared the Figure of perfect Amity with some Cautions to know a  Friend  from a  Flatterer  The Division of  Ingratitude  and the Dispraise  thereof with Instances of Kindness in Beasts Of the E∣lection of Friends and the Diversity of  Flatterers  illustra∣ted also with ancient Examples and Observations That many  Friends  are necessary for a Governor and herewith ends the  Second Book  at the Leaf containing Chapters  The  third  and last  Book  begins with a Discourse on the noble and most excellent Virtue named  Justice  whereupon it is observed from whence the Name of King first pro∣ceeded the Distinctions between commutative and cor∣rective Justice so proceeds to the first Part of Justice distri∣butive And here is first recommended the Love and Honour of  God  and the Example of the Gentiles instanc'd who in such Honour placed the chief Part of Justice This leads us to observe the Tranquillity that is caused by  Devo∣tion  and to consider the Places consecrated for the same Here we have the Justice of raising  Temples  for that purpose and offering our Worship therein with convenient  Ceremonies  Next he treats of the three Counsellors of Justice  Reason Society  and  Knowledge  and of its two Enemies  Violence  and  Fraud  with Examples shewing that Justice ought to be between Enemies Distinctions of the Word  Fides  which is the Foundation of Justice as when it may be called  Faith  when  Credance  when  Trust  also when named  Loyalty  according to the  French  or  Fidelity  from the  La∣tin  with several historical Illustrations of the same Then we come to that Part of  Fidelity  which concerns the keep∣ing of  Promises  or  Covenants  and here ends his Discourse upon Justice So we enter upon the noble Virtue of  For∣titude  and the two extreme Vices  Audacity  and  Time∣rosity  more particularly in what Acts Fortitude consists and that  Painfulness  is the first Companion of Fortitude with ancient Examples verifying the same according to the Method hitherto pursued Thus we come to his Recom∣mendations of  Patience  Advice how it may be obtained and a Remedy against  Impatience  Of Patience in sustain∣ing  Wrongs  and  Rebukes  also in Repulses or Hinderance of  Promotion  with the Commodities which happen from the Advancement of good Men Hence we proceed to the Praise of  Magnanimity  And in this Chapter among other Examples we have that of King  Edgar  's Treatment to the King of  Scots  who wondered that himself and other tall ablebodied Princes and Commanders should suffer them∣selves to be subdued by such a little Body as  Edgar  was Proving that by this Virtue and not by Chance he was  preferred to the Sovereignty over so brave a People Here follow the Vices attending this Virtue such as  Obstinacy  and  Ambition Abstinence  and  Continence  are next treated of as the Companions of Fortitude the former especially with relation to Rewards with Examples shewing how backward good Men have been against being led into the Bondage thereof and of the latter we have also Examples in several eminent Persons Next of Constancy Tempe∣rance and Moderation Of  Sapience  and the Definition thereof The Signification of the  Muses  of  Science  the  Un∣derstanding  Of past  Experience  and a Defence of  History  wherefore it is commendable what it signifies with an An∣swer to the Objections of those who would slight the Ad∣vantages thereof because it has been sometimes corrupted with fabulous Inventions Next we are taught the other Part of Experience or Practice necessary in the proper Per∣son of a Governor and then as a Vice necessary to be dis∣couraged in Men in Authority we have a Essay upon  De∣traction  with a Description of the Picture which  Apelles  painted thereof Lastly the three concluding Chapters are upon  Counsel  and  Consultation  in what form they ought to used in a Publick Weale and what therein ought to be chiefly considered As the Choice of good Counsellors and Regard to be paid them with the Method of  Belinger Baldasine  to discover what would be the Result of Opinions in Council and the Matter to be consulted of in which Generals are to be considered before Particulars And with this Head concludes the third and last Book of this pre∣sent Work which Book contains Chapters and the Volume ends with the Number of Leaves observed at the Beginning  XLIV  A COLLECTION HISTORICAL  and  POLITICAL  of Let∣ters Discourses Memorials  c  concerning several  Per∣sons  and  Places  of Note in the Reign of Queen  ELIZA∣BETH  Gather'd chiefly from the Papers of  HENRY  Earl of  DERBY  Lord Lieutenant of  Lancashire  and  Cheshire  and one of her Majesty's most Hon Privy Coun∣cill MS  Fol about Pages  IT was a Custom in the Reign when this Collection was made and indeed one or two Reigns after not fuller of Industry than Modesty and publick Spirit for Gentlemen of good Intelligence thus to copy over and transmit in Vo∣lumes to Posterity so many little observable and authentic Memoirs as otherwise for their Incongruity could never have been preserved but for their Use have been much prefer'd to our best Libraries In a Collection of this kind there is all the Toil of writing which in a continued Hi∣story is employed but none of the Partiality all the Use of Histories compiled for the Press but none of the Profit as if only the Information of After ages were intended thereby and all Praise Reward or Memory of those who were Instrumental to it studiously declined For from the Generality of these Collections which we have seen it seldom does appear otherwise than from what may be pre∣sumed as in the present Case who was the Collector or the Scribe or by whom and for what end they were set to work yet the end may be commonly understood in most of these Collections seeing many Particulars may be too well  known  or contain too much  Truth  or be Matter of too  private  a Concern or need the further Illustration of corresponding  Authorities  to be put in print in their Collectors own Time but transmitted thus in a  Miscella∣ny  or Cluster of indifferent Matters they are preserved like Fruits that find a Safeguard in their own Leaves till they arrive at that Maturity in which it is fit they should be oc∣casionally gathered for publick Use  The present Collection may perhaps as to some Parts of it be looked upon in this light Tho' the Transcriber's  Name does not directly appear several Parts of the  Collec∣tion  may sufficiently authorise the  Title  we have drawn out for it as above The Period of Time it relates to may be comprehended between the Years and they being the earliest and latest Dates we find therein and hence have we settled the Date in the said Title we have given it as believing nothing in the Book to be written below that Year It begins with a Letter from the Privy Council to the Earl of  Pembroke  informing him of her Majesty's Pleasure that the six hundred Foot and thirtytwo Demilances to be levied for the Service in the North out of the County of  Salop  should be taken out of the trained Numbers only in respect of the present Necessity and the Importance of the Service wherein they are to be employ'd also censuring some Negligence in his Lordship's Care for her Majesty's Service touching the Certificates of his Deputy Lieutenants of  Salop  and  Wigorne  for that the Provisions and Weapons they had supply'd were nothing an∣swerable to Expectation And further desiring his Lord∣ship's Opinion if the contagious Sickness now at  Ludlow  should continue whether her Majesty's Houshold should be removed to some other Place and his Lordship not repair into  Wilts  till it was over c This is the Substance of the said Letter which is subscribed with the Names of some Privy Counsellors but the Leaf is so much damaged and the Writing blinded by some Wet which has befaln it that all we can further read and this with great Difficulty is the Name of  Comptroller Chamberlain  and  Walsingham  but may guess from the hazardous Times spoken of in it that it was written at the first arming of the Nation against the  Spanish  Invasion about the Year The next Piece is a remarkable Letter from the Earl of  Leycester  then Governour of the Low Countries to Sir  Thomas Hennage  dated the d of September beginning thus  "Sithens my other Letters of the th yt fell oute that yester∣day Morninge some Intelligence was broughte that the Enemie was bringing a Convoye of Victuall garded with Horse There was sente out to ympeache yt Horse and Footemen and a Nomber more both Horse and Foote to second them Among other young Men my Nephew Sir  Philip Sydney  was and the rather for that the Coronell  Norrice  himselfe went with the Stande of Footemen to second the rest but the Van∣gard of the Prince was marched and came with this Con∣voye  and being a mystie Morninge our Men fell into the Ambuscade of Footemen who were the moste Musketts the reste Pykes Our Horsemen being for∣moste by their haste indeede woulde not turne but paste throughe and charged the Horsemen that flede at the backe of their Footmen so valientlie as albeyt they were Horse and of the verie Chieffe of all his Troupes they brake them being not Many of our Horses hurt and killed among which was my Ne∣phewes owne He wente and changed to another and woulde needes to the Charge again and onste paste those Musketters where he receyved a sore Wounde upon his Thighe three Fingers above his Knee the Bone broken quite in Peeces but for whiche Chance God did send such a Daye as I thinke was never many Yeres seene so fewe againste so many"  Here the Earl proceeds to enumerate the Commanders and other Persons of Distinc∣tion in this Rencounter whose Names were Colonel  Nor∣rice  who had the Charge of the Foot my Lord of  Essex  Sir  Thomas Perrot  "and my unfortunate  Phillip  sais he with Sir  William Russell  and divers Gentlemen and not one hurte but only my Nephew They killed four of their Enemies chief Leaders and carried the valient Count  Hannibal Gonzaga  away with them upon a Horse also took Captain  George Cresier  the principal Soldier of the Camp and Captain of all the  Albanez  My Lord  Willoughbie  overthrew him at the first Encounter Horse and Man The Gentleman did acknowledge it himself There is not a properer Gentleman in the Worlde to∣wards than this Lord  Willoughbie  is but I can hardly prayse one more than another they did all so well yet every one had his Horse killed or hurt"  And it was thought very strange  "that Sir  William Stanley  with of his Men should pass in spight of so many Muskets such Troops of Horse three several Times making them remove their Ground and to return with no more Loss than he did Albeyt I must say continues the Earl yt was too much Loss for me for this young Manne was my greateste Comforte next her Majestie of all the Worlde and if I could buy his Lieffe with all I have to my Sherte I woulde geve yt How God will dispose of him I know not but feare I must needes greately the worste the Blow is in so dangerous a place and so great yet did I never heare of any Manne that did  abide the dressinge and settinge his Bones better than he did And he was carried afterwards in my Barge to  Arnheim  and I heare this Daye he ys still of good hearte and comforteth all aboute him as much as maye be God of his Mercie graunte me his Lieffe which I cannot but doubt of greately I was abrode that tyme in the Fielde givinge some Order to supplie that Business which did indure almoste twoe Owres in continuall Fighte and metinge  Phillip  commynge upon his Horsebacke not a lytle to my Greafe But I woulde you had stode by to heare his most loyall Speeches to her Majestie his con∣stant Minde to the Cause his lovinge Care over me and his moste resolute Determmation for Deathe not one Jott appalled for his Blow which ys the moste greevous that ever I sawe with such a Bullet ryding so a longe myle and a halfe uppon his Horse ere he came to the Campe not ceasing to speak still of her Majestie be∣ing glad yf his Hurte and Deathe mighte any waye ho∣nour her Majestie for her's he was whileste he lyved and God's he was sure to be yf hee dyed Prayed all Men to thinke that the Cause was as well her Majestie's as the Countrie's and not to be discoraged for you have seene suche Successe as maye encorage us all and this my Hurte is the Ordinance of God by the happe of the Warre Well I praye God yf yt be his Will save me his Lieffe even as well for her Majestie's Ser∣vice sake as for myne own Comforte"  These are the Earl's Words concerning his said worthy Nephew and we thought it wou'd be excusable to transcribe thus parti∣cularly all he has there said of Sir  Philip Sidney  being a Man of such particular Merit even tho' it should oblige us to be the more general and concise in succeeding Topicks The rest of the Letter above a Page of small Writing more in folio relates to the Account of their Enemies Retreat the Prisoners taken and the chief  Spaniards  who were at the Charge with the Number of their Forces the hazard∣ous Enterprizes of the Lord  North  who tho' bruised on the Knee with a MusketShot yet leaving his Bed hastned to this Skirmish one Boot on and t'other off and went to the Matter very lustily Also of two hopeful young Gentlemen in the Camp Mr  Hatton  and Mr  Umpton  who were as ready in the Service as the meanest Soldiers and got with their Pikes into their Foreranks under  Row∣land Yorke  to second Sir  William Stanley  's Company  "and till we see what the Prince will do these notable young Fellows sais the Earl will not away"  And to this Effect ends the Letter Signed  Robte Leycester  The next Piece may be entitled  Arguments for the sud∣den Execution of  Mary  Queen of  Scots We have not Leisure now to examine whether it has ever been printed nor can we certainly say that the Earl aforesaid was the Au∣thor of it therefore shall only observe that it here makes four Pages and begins with these Words  "It may seeme a vayne Labor to goe about to heape upp Reasons for the persuadinge of that which is of such Necessitie as yt were againste all Reason any waye to thinke it mighte be desuaded"  It is written in the same Hand with the former and followed by another Letter of the said Earl's writing giving a further Account to some Nobleman here in  England  of their Success in winning a Town by Battery and the Enemies yielding before Assault in breaking their Horsemen in a most valiant Skirmish get∣ting from their Footmen two most strong Forts by Assault and making them forsake the third by Night the Prince himself being at hand with his whole Army and never at∣tempting after the first Skirmish to empeach them Which he only speaks in general of here expecting the Earl of  Essex  or some other that come over will be more particu∣lar And now that the Prince is retired intends to dismiss his Army into Garrison and make a Skip over to see his Friends  c  Dated at the Camp  Octo  After this we have a Letter signed  Richard Hollande  to a noble Lord intreating that his Lordship would be present at the hearing of a Cause in the StarChamber wherein his Bro∣therinLaw Mr  Dokenfield  was concerned Tis dated from  Heaton    May  And then follows  Queen  Eli∣zabeth's  Speech in Parliament  also the same Year  con∣cerning the Form of proceeding against the Queen of  Scots and the Delay of her immediate Answer to their Petition for the Execution of the said Queen till she had first  "with earnest Prayer beseeched his divine Majesty so to illuminate her Understanding and inspire her with his Grace as she may do and determine that which shall prove to the Establishment of his Church preservation of their Estates and Prosperity of this Commonwealth under her Charge"  This Speech consists of four Pages and a half and begins with these Words  "The bottom∣less Graces and immeasurable Benefits bestowed upon me  by Almighty God are and have been such as I must not only acknowledge them but also admire them  c  "  The next is Queen  Elizabeth  's Speech in  answer to the French Ambassador Monsieur  Believre  and the rest of his Company  justifying her Proceedings against the Queen of  Scots  It begins thus  "My Lords Ambassadors I trust so much upon the Goodness of the King my good Bro∣ther  c  "  And therein her Majesty sais  "I assure you that all the Sorrows and Afflictions which ever I did receive as concerning the Deaths of the King my Father the King my Brother and the Queen my Sister have not been such a Grief unto my Heart as the Matter we speak of I call God to witness if ever I would use her as she hath done me All this I take upon my Salvation or Damnation I have seen many Histories and read I be∣lieve as many I believe as any Christian Prince or Prin∣cess but I never found one Matter like unto this I re∣member well your Discourse and all that you have al∣ledged unto me but it cannot intice me to change my Will  c  "  Then follows the most sorrowful and de∣sperate Letter of  Margaret  Queen of  Navarre  to Mon∣sieur de  Sarlant  complaining of the Queen her Mother's abandoning her to shameful Ruin and protesting  "That as her Heart wou'd not let her fall into the Hands of her Enemies alive she would never eat more and that the first News her Mother shoud hear of her shoud be her Death"  After this we have  The Booke of the whole Navie  containing the Names of all the Queen's Majestie's Shippes with their Tonnage and nomber of Mariners Gun∣ners and Souldiers the of  December  From hence we learn the  Royal Navy  then consisted of Ships that the biggest named the  Triumph  was of Tun Burden carried Mariners Gunners and Soldiers Of the rest two were of Ton one of one of and seven of so lessening down to Ton some of them This List is followed with a Discourse entitled  An Analogie or Resemblance between  Joan  Queene of  Naples  and  Mary  Queen of  Scotland It consists of three Leaves and the Facts or Circumstances are drawn for Queen  Joan  chiefly from  Ran Collenutius  Lib  de Regno Neapolitano Pet Mexia in vita Vencelai Platina  and  Leonardus Areti∣nus in Historia Florentina  and those for Queen  Mary  are gather'd from  Buchanan de Nuptiis Mariae  also his History of  Scotland  and her own Letters This is followed with  an  Addition  to the said  Analogy  of Pages containing historical Examples or Precedents of Sovereign Princes be∣ing condemned and put to death in a formal and advised Manner in the Stories of Queen  Joan  aforesaid who was deliberately executed by  Charles  King of  Naples  thro' the Advice of  Lewis  King of  Hungary  and  Conradine  King of  Naples  who was in like manner condemned and publickly executed and the most Christian  Constantine  who put to death the Emperor  Licinius  with a Comparison between this Case and that of the Queen of  Scots  and here we have a Book of this Queen's referr'd to called  Expetit Causa∣rum  c Then follows a second Precedent of an Em∣peror  Tiberius  who put the King of  Thrace  to death as we have it in  Livy Tacitus  and  Suetonius  Also a third Pre∣cedent in the Emperor  Henry  VII who deprived  Robert  King of  Naples  and gave Sentence of Death against him Nay we have several Examples also produced of Popes who cannot err as themselves affirm giving their Judg∣ment for the putting of Kings to death as of Pope  Clement  IV against  Conradine  King of  Sicily  also Pope  Boniface  who put Pope  Caelestine  to death lest he shou'd for his singular Virtue be called again to the See and Pope  Urban  VIII who not only put to death eight Cardinals who are accounted part of his Body called his Brethren and in Offence to whose Persons the Crime of Treason lies according to  Gigas  and  Julius Clarus  but carried three of their Carkasses dried in an Oven about with him in Portmanteaus and had their purple Hats born up before him in terror to others which Examples and others are taken from  Collenutius Guildefingense Corn Agrippa Platina Pedro Mexia Augustine  besides some from the ancient  Romans  and confirming Authorities from  Hugoline Johan Delignano  and others and all to encourage the execution of the unquiet Queen of  Scots  The next Piece is a Letter of a private Nature from Sir  Edward Standley  to my Lord his Brother intreating him to move the Archbishop of  Canterbury  to make his Friend  John Kine  a Proctor of the Arches and contains some Acknowledgments for the receipt of some Monies from his  Lordship  for his Charges in a LawSuit It is dated from  Winwycke    December  And then fol∣lows  Liber Pacis  or  the Names of all the Justices of Assize  in the several Counties of  England  and  Wales  This List in double Columns takes up Leaves After this  we have another List which is called also  a Book of the Number Names and Burden of all the Ships Barques and Vessels with the Names of all Masters and able Mariners belonging thereto within or appertaining to the River of  Chester It was written by  William Wale  the Mayor at the Command of the Earl of  Derby  to whom it is addres∣sed in an Epistle by the said Mayor bearing Date  February  and it appears in these Lists that the Number of Ships Barques  c  from the Burden of twen∣ty to sixty Tons were fifteen in Number and that the Owners Masters and Mariners with the Places of their abode are named and number'd at To this is joined the like Account of all the Barques  c  belonging to the River of  Preston  in  Lancashire  called the Water of  Rible  and this is perform'd by  Laurence Walle  Mayor of  Preston  at the Command of the said Earl of  Derby  he being Lord Lieutenant also of this County as appears by this Mayor's Letter to his Lordship This List of Vessels is contained in one Page and they are eight in Number from the Bur∣den of four to ten Ton The like Book or List of all the Vessels belonging to the River  Wyer  in  Lancashire  as well abroad as at home with their Burden Masters  c  is ad∣dressed to the said Earl of  Derby  according to his Com∣mand the same Year by  Henry Butler  Esq  and  William Skillicorne  Gent The Number of these Vessels are and the Burden between four and eighteen Ton This is followed with such another Account of the Vessels be∣longing to the Peele of  Foodre  and the Creeks thereof

are but five Vessels in Num∣ber from the Burden of two to twenty Ton And to this is joined one more such List of all the Vessels in the Port of  Liverpoole  in the said County taken the same Year with the Names of the Places they were bound to the Owners Mariners  c  They appear to be twentyeight in Number and from eight to forty Ton Burden Then follows a Note concerning the intire  Subsidy  and the two  Fifteenths  and  Tenths  granted in Parliament the first Pay∣ment whereof was to be in  November  next  viz  and the second in  November  With the Manner of appointing the Collectors thereof After this we have a  Letter from Captain  A Cosbye dated at  Utrecht  the  February  to Sir  William Stanley  advising him to retain the Town of  Deventer  for her Majesty's Use not∣withstanding the Contentions between him and  Taxis  for the Government or the Expectation of great Forces from the Prince to remove him as what will no doubt recover his Credit Pardon and her Majesty's Favour And offers himself to be employ'd into  England  to further this Service The next Paper is  a List of all the Soldiers and Munition in the Castle of  Russhen  and  Castle Peele  in the Isle of  Man directed to the Earle of  Derby  with a Note at the Bottom of all the Provisions wanting there which it is hoped his Lordship will speedily supply And to this is joyned  the Num∣ber of all sort of serviceable Men within the said Island  Here it appears the Number of Horsemen were Calli∣vermen Bowmen and Billmen but all much unprovided with Weapons and other Furniture as appears by a Note of their Wants at bottom signed by  R Sherburne H Scarisbricke W Lucas T Burscoghe  and  H Radclyff  The next is  A particular Valuation of  Gud∣disden Demain where it appears that the Sum total of Acres is and the total Value  per Annum    l    s    d  To this is joined a Particular also of  St Leonard's Rents  being Shillings Then follows a strange Account of Madam  St Marcian  's Vision on  April  being  ShroveTuesday  of three Ladies with Hawks on their Hands hawking as it were at Sheep in the Meadow before her but being sent to the Messenger cou'd see nothing The Lady with other of her Company still seeing them from her Chamber sent again but no body appeared She still seeing them and fearing some Violence sent a number of Men with Arms charging them to fire at whatever they saw they found at last a Cow but that vanished from them at which instant Madam  St Marcian  and her Com∣pany saw the three Ladies with their Hawks Sheep Cow  c  all throw themselves headlong with great noise into the River out of which a Flock of Swallows mounted into the Air At the same instant also the Mayor of  Saints in Xanctoign  coming through a Meadow near the Town saw three fair Ladies kneeling and eating of Grass of whom taking pity he invited them to better Fare but they made him reproachful Answers yet he invited them again afterwards by his Servant whom they also answered dtsdainfully wishing him to be gone saying  we are Three whose Names are Death Famine and Pestilence  Then follows  the Warrant of Sir Peter Leigh  ProvostMarshal of  Lancashire  and  Cheshire  and Justice of the Peace to the Keeper of  Chester  Goal to receive and de∣tain therein the Body of  Randulph Northburie  Husband∣man for very heinous and slanderous Words spoken against  Robert  Earl of  Leicester  dated at  Lyme  in  Handley    April  And next we have  the Charge that is given to the Queste of Howsehoulde as well at the Castle as at the Peele  in the Isle of  Man  with particular Instructions to the Officers there in one Sheet After this we have  an Ad∣dress from Cambridge  to the Lord Treasurer  Burghley  Chan∣cellor of that University to rectify some Grievances there∣in mentioned signed by nineteen Persons among whom are  John Bentley John Weston Rob Russel Will Gager Jo Holland Leonard Hutton John King Tho Crane Rich Thorneton  c Then follows a Transcript of some  Letters  The first of which is from the Earl of  Leycester  to a Friend concerning some Persons who had as he in∣timates wrongfully treated or represented him in his Ab∣sence of whom he sais  "Touching my Lord  Buckhurst Norris  and  Wilkes  I doubt not but her Majesty and my Lords do sufficiently understand of their Doings by this For dealing with  Wilkes  to have his Resolution I desire it not nor like not to deal with so ungrateful and un∣thankful Wretches let him and they do their worste they shall be found as they are and I as I am I trust The Bruits touching  Sluce  if they be ill and believed against me I have the more Wrong I will never write three Lines to satisfie such Persons I know I have done as much as any lyving in my Place and it sufficeth me that I know it to be so I am sorry my Friends should be troubled to excuse me when in Conscience I have done all that became me I have deserved better of my Coun∣trymen's Hands than lightly to believe of me But they shall seke another hereafter to deal as I have dealt for them if they reward me so  c  Dated from  Dorte    August  "  The next is a Letter to the Earl of  Derby  signed by the Vicar of  Great Marlow  in  Buckingham∣shire  whose Name was  Thomas Browne  and the Church∣wardens  c  testifying That  Jane Boulde  Wife of  Richard Boulde  Esq  who was reported to have absented herself from the Church and not to use the same accord∣ing to the Injunctions thought meet did frequent his Church tho' it was two Miles distant from her House at  Harleford  and she had been out of order Dated  April  The next is a Letter from  Arthur Aty  to the Right Honourable Mr  John Wooley  of her Majesty's Privy Council shewing what indifferent Opinion was held of the  English  Aids in  Holland  as if  "her Majesty had already agreed upon the Conditions of Peace with the Duke of  Parma  and that she would endeavour to enforce the  States General  thereunto as he had heard from Monsieur  Aversons  Secretary to the said States And though his Lord  Leicester  we suppose had travell'd much about to the Towns with great Diligence instill'd the most ho∣nourable Thoughts of her Majesty and brought the Mat∣ter in good Terms as well for Satisfaction of those who are misled as to encourage their treating with her Majesty in the Peace yet thinks it will be very difficult for most who mislike the Peace or  England  or him seek no∣thing more than to abase his Credit upon the surmised Grounds before written and the earnest Pressing of the said Peace from  England  which yet he hopes will do well this Way but in his Opinion wou'd have fall'n out the other Way his Lordship first took to her Majesty's good liking tho' not in haste  c  "  'Tis dated at the  Haghe    Octob    After these Letters we have the Answer of  Christopher Sothworthe  Priest born in  Lancashire  Son of Sir  John Sothworthe  and aged Years to several Articles against and Examinations of him which Answer he made before Dr  White  Dr  Beacon Rich Topclyff  and  Rich Yonge  whereby it appears that he being earnestly required to conform himself in Religion according to the Laws of her Majesty now established refused utterly saying  "He is taught that Doctrine and Religion at  Rome  wherein he will stand and hopeth to die"  These Answers contain three Pages Then follows two Letters by the Earl of  Leicester  to Mr  Woolley  aforesaid both written from the Low Countries From the first consisting of six Pages we learn That Mr  Woolley  had conveyed to her Majesty his Lordship's Replications to the Lord  Buckhurst  Sir  John Norris  and  Wylkes  and that he had advised his Lordship not to be severe in following Revenge for her Majesty hath them still in her Displeasure and they give it out that it is only for his Lordship's Cause In this Letter he fur∣ther declares they have Friends to help them to execute their foul Facts and he few to help to deliver him in his  just Defence And asks what he should have been thought of if he had left their Declaration unanswered That in what her Majesty has spared them for herself they ought the more to acknowledge it and what she laid upon them for his Sake he is upon his Knees with all Humbleness to yield most dutyful Thanks As to his Successor that is talked of and whether he was to be Governor General as his Lordship is or only have the Government over her Majesty's People there he thinks it will soon be resolved for that the States have found such a sweet Taste in com∣manding as well Men as Money that they will hardly yield to any more Governors till they must by force therefore that it shou'd be seen his Lordship would be the last We are here informed also of the Dispute his Lordship had with the States about the Payment of the Men he carried over with him Also concerning  Sluce  Haven what he has written about it and Mr  Beal  is to deliver And that nothing can be done but by Count  Maurice  of whose bad Dealing her Majesty doth know That the Talk of Peace holds all Things in suspence That it is greatly press'd by some to make it conceived that it will be better for themselves to deal by themselves than to join with her Majesty and herein doth  Maurice  and  Hollock  join and practice for life against her as they have done ever since his Lordship came over and that he shall hazard some∣what to impeach their Doings as he intends And a lit∣tle further  "What a Tyme of Faction I have suffered and now more than ever for that the Assurance of Peace dothe drawe many from me and my Authoritie and so falleth it out every Day more manifeste than other I am here withoute eyther Nobleman Officer or Coun∣cellor  Killigrewe  I am fayne to leave at  Hage  where the Councel are my self for her Majesties Service to wander upp and downe bothe in daylie Danger of my Lyffe and yet withoute so doing shoulde not be able to staye Men's Mindes as they ought to bee And if her Majesties Letter had bene delivered to the  States  that  Atye  broughte never Man had receyved so undeserved a Shame as I had and utterlie dishonoured her own Do∣ing withall Such Comfort I am subject unto And all this while not one Person sent over to confirm my Doings which were meet so to bee nor to expostu∣late to these Men as it had bene convenience in so dan∣gerous a Tyme as this ys for yt ys not the haste of Peace  nor the Shewes of yt that will bring such a Peace as should bee  c  "  This Letter is signed with the Earl's Name and dated of  Octob  The next Letter by the said Earl to the same Person informs us That this Peace in hand begins to make great War in those Parts for that none wou'd hear of it but such as wholly depend∣ed on her Majesty And here he further expresses his Un∣easiness under his Charge thus  "I assure you my Lyffe was never wearisome to me till nowe I woulde my Estate here were eyther felte hearde or understood I knowe of so many professed Friendes as I have I shall finde some woulde seeke to releyve yt"  And further that he was near  Horne  in  North Holland  and means to stay a few Days thereabouts desires to be excused to the Lords for that all his Secretaries are employ'd abroad hopes to hear from him speedily the blessed Sound of Retreat that he is dispatching the Soldiers as fast home as he can that he trusts the Lords will consider how little Cause he has to stay there any longer except now he has worne out all his Company they intend he shall weare out himself So ends in haste the of  Octob    Then follow some more private Accounts relating chief∣ly to the Estates  c  of the Earl of  Derby  as we gather by Circumstances beginning with  a Note of the Particu∣lars of my Lord's Stand at  Pilkington This is an Inven∣tory of the Goods or Furniture in the Apartments there The next Paper is  an Account of Wood sold  in this Method The first Column contains the Names of the Commission∣ers the next the Names of the Woods the next the Year when sold and the Valuation next the Earnest Mo∣ney and lastly Earnest Money received These Woods were named  Stretlie Gorynge Burciter Middleton  and  Arn∣cot Whichford Ardington Brackley Gadesden  and  Wyn∣nington  And the Sales were made between the and th Years of the Queen's Reign To this is added a se∣parate Paper of the  Earnest of my Lord's Woods  for those Years the Sum total whereof is  l    s    d  To this is also join'd  an Account of the riding Charges allowed by the Auditors to the Commissioners for sale of the sad Woods  in those three Years And this is followed with  Orders set down by my Lord for Earnest Money due unto his Lordship for the Sale of Woods  These Orders are agreed to by the Commissioners aforesaid whose Names are  Tho Harte Edw Clarke Jam Kenwicke  and  Edw Gunne  And the  Agreement is witnessed amongst others by  Edward Rigby  Gent who is expressed in the next Page to be a Receiver for the Earl of  Derby  in the southern Parts of  England  and whose Receipts we have here audited in the th of the said Queen's Reign at the End of which Account is mention∣ed the Sale of the abovesaid Woods in this last mention'd Year for upwards of  l  Then follows a short Bill of some yearly Payments The next Paper is called  a Note what Lybertie Mr  Butler  of  Bewsey  Esq  had by Vertue of the Conveyance passed between the Earl of  Leycester  and him to lymmit and appointe to his Wieffe or Wyves  The next is entitled  Rygate in Com  Surrey and contains the Particulars of three Woods that is  Erle  's Wood described to be well set with great Oaks and Beeches containing Acres valued at  l Petrydge  Wood containing Acres valued at  l    s    d  and  Raye  Wood con∣taining Acres valued at  l  The next Memorial seems to be a very curious and particular Account of  the whole yearly Revenue of the Kingdom of  Spain First be∣ginning with the Revenues of all the  States  belonging to that Crown The Mines Customs of them and of the  Slaves  amounting to above ten Millions four Hundred Thousand Duckets Next of the King's yearly Pension from the five Orders of  Knighthood  and his Profits upon bestowing the  Encomendas  belonging to three of them with the particular Names Number and Value thereof where it appears the whole Order of St  James  amounts to Duckets The whole Order of  Calatrava  to Duckets including that of  Monteza  The whole Order of  Alcantara  to Duckets Besides the Or∣der of St  John  at this time divided between Don  Antonio de Toledo  and the base Son of the Duke of  Alva  Fur∣ther that out of the Rents of the three Orders of  Encomen∣das  that King receives as Great Master for his Part year∣ly two Hundred and seventy Thousand Duckets Then follows an Account of the yearly Charges which that King is at amounting to above seven Millions of Duckets which compared with his Receipts leaves him above two Millions eight hundred Thousand clear  Next we come to a few Papers of more private or par∣ticular Concern again as a  Remonsrance to the Lord Chan∣celler  Hatton  and Lord Treasurer  Burghley with the rest of the Council assembled in the Court of StarChamber against  John Crapnell  who was to have a Cause heard in this  Court being a violent Invective against him persuading that he is and has been a Rogue in all manner of Lights or Practices But we here want the Conclusion of it After this we have an  Estimate of the Livings of  John Salusburie of Lleweny  Esq  in Possession and Reversion And the next is a very odd Story entitled  The Confession of  Edw Burnell 'Tis comprised in six Pages and the Substance of it is this This Mr  Burnell  as appears by his own Com∣plaint had met with hard Usage in the  Court of Wards and Liveries  was turn'd out of some Possessions and had brought his Adversaries into the  StarChamber  for Perjury and Forgery But here the Equity of his Cause not being heard he thought he had a right to say her Majesty want∣ed  faithful Hearts  to see according to her Disposition Justice executed Hereupon he prepares a  NewYear's Gift  for her Majesty which was a  Latin  Oration but he was taken up and examined before Sir  George Carey  and  Ralph Lane  Esq  the very Day yet so early as two o'clock in the Morning that he was to have made his said Speech which was  January  This Examination we have here with that also of Mr  Burnell  's Servant  John Cart∣wright  and therein it appears when they demanded what his  NewYea's Gift  was to be he answer'd he had it about him so opening his Doublet he shewed his naked Breast and said that after declaring to her Majesty his good Mean∣ing towards her by the Oration he had made in  Latin  he would have ripped his Body as far as he cou'd and his Breast so far as he might without Danger of Death to have shewn her Majesty his Heart They demanded whom he acquainted with this Device He answered he had advised with  Paul Warren  and one  Gyles  two Surgeons had asked them whether a Man being ripped down the Body might not yet live They answer'd hardly but upon his impor∣tuning  Warren  who was his Relation he promised if he continued resolute that he wou'd meet him at  Greenwich  where the Court lay this Morning Being required to set down the Oration he meant to have pronounced also to give them an Account of what Places and Company he had been in for eight Days before He answered by writing the said Oration down which we have here in half a Page with the Causes that moved him to give this Gift also the Particulars where and with whom he had been since  Christmas  Day last And thus much for Mr  Burnell  's  NewYear's Gift  This is followed with a Note of the  Mannor of Wyming∣ton in Com Bedford  the Rents and Parcels thereof as they have been letten before the Lease made to Mr  Edw On∣ley  by the Earl of  Derby  A like Note we have here also of  Prescot Rectory  both as to the old Rents and an Esti∣mate of the thirteen several Tithes demised thereunto Where it appears that the Sum total of the Value was then in  January  near  l per Annum  The next Piece is entitled  The Manner of the Execution of the Queen of  Scotts  the    of  Feb  in the Presence of such whose Names are underwritten  This takes up two Sides and leads us in the next Leaf to the  Accounts of Sir  Richard Shirburne of Moneys receiv'd and paid by Warrant from the Earl of  Derby  to  Henry Stanley  of  Crosshall  Esq  MusterMaster for buying Arms for the train'd Soldiers in  Lancashire  and repairing of Beacons there The next is entitled  Fees al∣lowed yearly to the Earl of  Derby as Forrester of  Bleas∣dall  c Another of  Moneys

next is  a Letter from the  English  Ambassador at  Paris  to a Privy Counsellor  commending the good Offices and Qualities of his Nephew there and informing him that the King will receive the  Order  on  Thursday  next with as great Honour and show of Goodwill as is possible The next Leaf contains  an approved Medicine for the Stone  which is in a Gallon of new Milk to steep Pellitory of the Wall wild Thyme Saxifrage Parsly each a handful with two or three Radish Roots sliced one Night then distill it all over a moderate Fire So drink six Spoonfuls of the Water with as many of Rhenish Wine adding a little Sugar and Nutmeg lukewarm fasting and eat no∣thing three Hours after It should be drank the first Week three times together and every Week after but twice for it forceth very much Urine If no great Pain is felt in the Kidneys 'tis better to drink it but once every eight Days three Mornings together Next after a Note of the  Bedding in the Lodge at  Pilkinton a Seat of the Lord  Der∣by  's aforesaid we have Copies of two Letters in  French  the one called  Responce de la Royne a la Harangue de Mon∣sieur de Bellieure Ambassadeur pour le Roy de France touch∣ant le Pardonne ensemble la Liberte de la Royne D' Escosse  and the other  Coppie de la Lettre de la Royne de Navarre  Neither of which need be further here particulariz'd the Translations of both into  English

this approved Work is in a graved Frontispiece which contains Emblematical Representations as was usual in these Times of  Fame  crowning the Pour∣trait of  Leicestershire  and  Truth  crowning that of Antiquity with the  Sun  in a Compartment between them in E∣clipse and this Motto  Relucera  over a Cave the En∣trance of which is cover'd with a Curtain upon which the said  Title  is inscribed and at the Bottom a Prospect of our Author's Seat named  Lindley  In another Leaf facing that Frontispiece we have the Author's Effigies in his Lawyer's Gown  Aetat  his Arms at the Cor∣ners and for an Emblem at bottom the  Sun  with this Motto  Relumbre  Both graved by  Francisco Delaram  He dedicates the Book to  George Villers  Marquesse and Earl of  Buckingham  Lord High Admiral  c  He being a Native of that County and none having the like Power to defend his Work against the Adversaries of Truth In the Preface he apologizes for applying himself to Studies beside his Profession by intimating that if the Law ad∣mitted  any Partner the most necessary would be this Study of Antiquities And that his Constitution being weak it disabled him from following the Practice which his Calling required which obliging him to the Retirement of a Coun∣try Life and depriving him of those Helps the City wou'd have afforded must render his Discourse less equal to the Worthiness of the Subject yet rather than his Country should longer lie obscur'd in Darkness he adventures to restore her to her Worth and Dignity animated by the Ex∣amples of the never enough admir'd Antiquary  W Camden  and that industrious and well deserving Master  John Speede  who in his elaborate History of  England  has well spoken of all the Shires and by his great Travail and Expences ad∣ded the Maps of each Shire with the Plot of every City and great Town therein inserted never before performed by any Also by the grave and sage Lawyer  W Lambert  who from the Depth of Antiquity has restored the County of  Kent  Also the eloquent and noble Gentleman  Richard Carew  Esq  who very worthily has surveyed all  Cornwall  and that excellent Surveyor  John Norden  Gentleman who has briefly described the Counties of  Middlesex  and  Hertford∣shire  and since has made certain chorographical Tables of some Western Shires and a fine Prospective of the City of  London  He also acknowledges the Encouragments he had from some of his Friends as  John Beaumont  of  Grace∣dieu  Esq  and that expert Genealogist his Kinsman Mr  Augustine Vincent RougeCroix  who imparted many worthy Notes to him from the Tower and whose Labours in this kind for the County of  Northampton  wou'd ere long come to light Further that in this Description he has run through in every Town those four Sections above men∣tion'd in the TitlePage As for the  Topography  of the County he rectified some Years past  Christ Saxton's  Map thereof with an addition of Towns which was graved at  Amsterdam  by  Jodocus Hondius  and since imi∣tated by  Speede  with an Augmentation of the Plot of  Leicester  and reduced into a lesser Form is here inserted Of the more eminent  Places  he has spoken something throughout and where any  natural  Passage offer'd he has not thought it impertinent to satisfy the Reader a little in this kind also adorn'd it with some historical Digressions which have dependance upon the Work has observ'd as near as he cou'd when Monasteries Churches noble Seats and other  memorable Buildings  were founded also distin∣guished  the  Descent  of  Titles  to  Lands  whether by Heirs or Grants that the Antiquity of Continuance in a Name might be discover'd and the antient Owner known not intend∣ing to derogate from any Man's Right or move Doubts or Questions thereunto But in setting down of  Tenures  he has been very sparing The  Soccage  Tenure he has express'd but no Certainty of any other unwilling to give any Cause of Offence as knowing there are more Differences and strange Proceedings in these Businesses than in any one Thing of so common a Nature tho' they might be rec∣tified if the truest and most probable Records and Evidences were accepted As for the  Law Cases  which have latterly happen'd in the Shire he has briefly remember'd them Touching the  Genealogies  and  Arms  of the Gentry he only speaks of the Ancient whose Families are extinct lest not contenting the Living he should be question'd without Cause yet has in this respect remember'd some few of his Friends In ChurchMatters he has follow'd an old Ma∣nuscript compil'd  Anno    There is a Transcript of it above Years old in the  Cotton Library  wherein is discover'd what Churches were Rectories what Appropriate If Rec∣tories who was Patron who Incumbent what Chapels belong'd to them and how to be served If Appropriate to what Monastery or religious House belonging  c  Has further added from the Records in the Office of the Auditors of the Imprest their Value in the King's Books and shewn who are the present Patrons of every Church The  Roman  Antiquities and others he has briefly touch'd as far as came to his Knowledge And lastly has added all the  Arms  in all the  ChurchWindows  in the Shire and the  Inscriptions  of the  Tombs  which he took by his own View and Travel for that they may correct many Errors in Armory or Genealogy and end many Differences in Law the Evidence of a ChurchWindow having been ac∣cepted by a Jury at an Assizes Has also added the Names to most of the Coats not following herein the conceited Blazonry of  Gerard Leigh  or others of later Times but used such Terms as himself was best acquainted with and might best serve for any one's understanding Thus we have the whole Scope of his Intention or a general View of the Topicks not only treated of in this Book but to be treated of in Books of the like nature  After the Preface whereof we have here given the Sub∣stance we have  Saxton  's Map therein spoken of graved by  William

of this County had been overshadowed so few others should see the way to imitate his Example by their further Illustra∣tions thereof Insomuch that we know not of any one County in  England  which in that compass of Years has had fewer Publications bestowed upon it relating either to its  Antiquities  or  natural History  Nay even our Author's own improved Copy of this Work very much enriched with  Roman Saxon  and other Antiquities has to this day been deny'd the Light Wherefore we thought it a Debt due to his Merit as well as to the Subject he has celebrated to take the Notice we have here done of them in order to excite those whom it may concern to oblige the Publick either with that enlarged Work of this Author with further Continuations thereof or any other such Memorials of the Place and its Products as may render them with what Justice they deserve no less consi∣derable than other Counties and their Productions appear in this Island  XLVI  A RESTITUTION  of decay'd

after the Author's Death the first which he printed himself at  Antwerp  being in the Year The Author was skilful in Drawing and Limning and has em∣bellish'd his Work with several Draughts which are neatly graved and have not a little advantaged the Sale of the  Work insomuch that there have since been two Editions more of it in  Octavo  but the Impression of the Cuts are therein worn faint and not so valuable as those in the first Quarto Editions  The Author in his Epistle to the noble and renowned  English  Nation among other Motives for his Undertaking intimates his finding our  English  Writers to stand so much upon the Descent of the  Britains  to be one as if it con∣cern'd the Original and Honour of the  English  Nation whereby and through the want of due Distinction between the two Nations an Oversight which the  Britains  in their Account of us will never commit our true Original and honourable Antiquity lie involv'd and obscur'd  c  Thus  John Boden  wou'd make us believe it is in  Caesar  's Com∣mentaries to be found That the  Englishmen  of his Time had but one Woman to serve for ten or twelve Men Whereas  Caesar  never heard the Name of  Englishmen  who came not into  Britain  near Years after his Death And thus not to let slip the Opportunity of a Lash at Mr  Fox  he is censur'd for beginning his  Acts  and  Monuments  with saying that  Constantine  was the Son of  Helen  an  English  Woman Thus another entitles his Dictionary which is in  Latin  and  English Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae  which wou'd have been proper enough had it been written in  Latin  and  Welsh  Having reflected on the Confusion which such Indistinctions create he shews that  Englishmen  cannot but from the  Saxons  derive their Descent and Off∣spring and can lack no Honour in descending from such an honourable Race as this Work will specify which our Au∣thor was induced to publish for his love to this noble Nation most dear to him because it was his Birthplace tho' his Grandfather who was driven into  England  by Wars and loss of Friends was born in  Geldres  Towards the Conclusion of this Epistle he informs us that if in his Etymologies he dif∣fers from some  Germans  'tis where he has found them mistaken by having look'd little further than the Language used among themselves even like those who have also written in the  Netherlands  whereas the understanding of the  Teutonic  used by our  Saxon  Ancestors as also that of the ancient  Franks  is most requisite and thereunto the  High Low  and  Easterland Teutonic  with respect also to the dependant  Danish  and  Swedish  besides our modern vul∣gar  English    "In all which says he I have bestowed some time of Travell for that hereby and not otherwise the  true Reason and Concurrence of Things properly apper∣taining to the true Original  Teutonic  Tongue is best to be found out and made manifest"  After several Copies of  Latin  Verses by  Richard White  of  Basinstoke Richard Stanihurst  and others and some  English  Verses by  Tho Shelton Fr Tregian A Greneway Ralph Badclyfe  and the Author himself we enter upon the Work which is divided into  Ten  Chapters The First is  Of the Original of Nations and consequently that from which  Englishmen  are descended  In this Chapter the Author dis∣courses after shewing that the  English  are of  German  De∣scent heretofore called  Saxons  and still in the  British  as also the ancient  Irish  Tongue so called of the Original of Nations from the Division after the Deluge at the Tower of  Babel  and upon the numerous Increase of Posteri∣ty illustrated in the Example of the Issue of one Person near our Author's Time and that was a Woman named  Yoland Baillie  who died at  Paris  aged Years and in the eighth Year of her Widowhood by whose Epitaph in the Churchyard of St  Innocents  it appears there were Children issued from herself while she lived Then we have an Account how the People after the Flood inhabited the Mountains how  Nimrod  took upon him the first Go∣vernment Particulars of the Tower of  Babel  as to its width and height from  Josephus  and  Isidore  Of the Con∣fusion of Tongues whence the Original of Nations whence the  Hebrews  were so called The Posterity of  Sem Cham  and  Japhet  That the People were not mixed by the Confusion of Tongues Concerning the Inhabitants of the  WestIndies  we are referr'd to  Augustine Carate  's History of those Parts How the  Dutch  are descended from  Tuisco  Whence some Days of the Week are derived That the  Germans  were the first and only Possessors of their Country Touching their Name of  Germans  and  Almans  with their divers other Names A Remark upon  Leland  's asserting that the  Cimbri  and  Sicambri  received their Names of  Cambria  the Daughter of  Belinus  King of  Britain  Expla∣nations of the Names of the  Freislanders Swevians Goths Danes Normans Vandals Longobards  and  Saxons  who were so called from the crooked Weapons they wore like a Scithe still called in the  Netherlands  a  Saisen  The watch Word  Nem eowr Seaxes  Examples of other People re∣ceiving their Denomination from their Weapons as the  Scythians  from Shooting the  Galliglasses  from their  Pole∣axes  as others anciently from the Clothes and Gowns they wore And these are the chief Contents of this Chapter  The second Chapter shews  how the ancient noble  Saxons  the true Ancestors of  Englishmen  were originally a People of  Germany And here he asserts That all our Writers agree the  Englishmen  came from  Germany  That all had their Begin∣ning in  Asia  That the Affinity between the  German  and  Per∣sian  Language affirmed by some extended not to half a score Words as our Author was inform'd from the best Interpre∣ters in the Train of Sir  Ant Sherley  and  Cuchin Ollibeag  Ambassadors from  Persia  in  Italy Anno  That the  Gauls  and  Germans  were by the  Grecians  called  Celtae  from their frequent Riding A Specimen of the  Persian  Tongue into which the Beginning of the first Chapter of  Genesis  is here translated A fabulous Narration of  Occa Scarlensis  concerning  Friso Saxo  and  Bruno  with a Confutation thereof That  Brunswick  took its Name of  Bruno  Son of  Ludolph  Duke of  Saxony  who first began to build it in the Year This is followed with Arguments to prove that our  Saxon  Ancestors were originally of  Germany  and did not come from other Parts thither with the Concur∣rence of  Lipsius  Observations that no Nations call one ano∣ther as each calls himself and that the  Germans  who were the continu'd Possessors of  Germany  were never subdued also unmixed both in People and Language That the  French  issued from the  Franks  in  Germany  to whom the ancient  Gauls  gave place much about the Time that the  Saxons  came thence into  Britain  That the  Longobards  or People of  Lombardy  and also the  Normans  issued from the  Germans  as the Nobility of  Spain  from the  Goths  Then we have many ancient Testimonies of the Worthiness of the  Germans  with a Description of the Country as it was antiently also the Vertues and Manners of the Peo∣ple Arguments and Examples to prove That it is not the Climate or Temperature of the  Air  makes the Peo∣ple of any Country more or less learned or ingenious A Recital of sundry rare  Inventions  in Arts and Sciences which had their Original in  Germany  Reflections upon their national Vice of Drunkenness  The third Chapter describes  the antient Manner of living among our  Saxon  Ancestors The Idols they adored while they were Pagans and how they grew to be of greatest Name and Habitation of any other People in  Germany Here our  said Ancestors are very particularly described as to their personal Appearance in Attire Arms Exercise the Orders or Degrees of People among them their Custom of  Gavelkind Give all kind  or give each Child his Share the nur∣sing of Children by their own Mothers their counting of Time by the Nights as Se'nnights and Fortnights and the Ages of their own Lives by Winters Their Computa∣tation of Time they notched upon square Sticks called  Al∣monaght  or  All moon heed  whence our  Almanac  Here we have the old  Saxon  Names of the twelve  Months  in the Year with their Explanations which we now call by Names of  French  and  Latin  Derivation Next of the an∣cient Government of  Saxony  the four sorts of  Ordeal  or Trial of Right by Combat hot Iron hot Water and cold Water But not thought fit to be continued among Chri∣stians they were abolish'd by Pope  Stephen  Here we enter upon the Idolatry of the Pagan  Saxons  and their superstitious Customs for presaging of Events More particularly of their Idols for the seven  Days  in the  Week  which we have here neatly represented in Sculpture as first the Idol of the  Sun  whence comes the Name of  Sunday  next that of the  Moon  whence  Monday  next the Idol of  Thysco  whence  Tuesday  next is their Idol  Woden  or God of Battle whence  Wednes∣day  the next is their Majestic  Thor  sitting under a Throne with a Circle of Stars behind his Head whence  Thursday  the next is  Friga  an Idol that represented both  Sexes  with a Sword in one Hand and Bow in the other was reputed the Giver of Peace and Plenty the Causer of Love and Friendship and from the Day of her Adoration we yet retain the Name of  Friday  The last is the Idol of  Seater  repre∣sented standing on the sharpfinn'd back of a Pearch to sig∣nify the  Saxons  for serying him should pass without Harm in dangerous Places also holding a Wheel in his left Hand to betoken their Unity and Concurrence in one Course and a Pail full of Water Flowers and Fruits in the right Hand to denote that with kindly Rain he wou'd nourish and dispose the Earth to such Productions After these we have an Ac∣count of two other  Saxon  Idols as that named  Ermensewl  or the Pillar of the Poor which the  Franks  with other  Germans  as well as the  Saxons  ador'd And that also named  Flynt  from the Stone it stood on besides three or four more which are only named And here we have our Author's Reasons why the  Romans  mistook the  German  Idols to be derived from their own as  Thor  from  Jupiter Friga  from  Venus  and  Seater  from  Saturn  Also his Remarks on the horrible Excess of Idolatry their Votaries were arrived to in that  Harold  I King of  Norway  sacrificed two of his Sons to his Idols that they might grant such a Tempest as would dis∣perse and confound the Fleet which  Harold  VI King of  Denmark  was preparing to send against him Further that in  Britain  none of their Idols were in greater Request than  Woden  as by several Places in  Kent Staffordshire  and  Wilt∣shire  may appear which retain their Appellations from him But these Idols were all demolish'd by  Ethelbert  the first Chri∣stian  English Saxon  King and others of those Kings in their several Territories Next we are inform'd how the  Saxons  extended their Bounds in  Germany  beyond any other People there and how they were transported by  Charles  the Great into  Transilvania  and other Regions which introduces an incredible Story of a  Transportation  which happen'd in  Saxony  not many Ages past For there came into the Town of  Hamel  in  Brunswick  a Man whom partly from his patch'd or motlycolour'd Coat they called the  Piedpiper  who having agreed with them to rid their Town of Rats wherewith it was much annoyed he with his Pipe drew all the said Vermin after him into the River  Weaser  where they were drown'd But the Townsmen then swerving from their Agreement the discontented  Piper  gave them another Tune thro' the Town again but it was a revengeful one drawing all the Children therein to the Number of after him till they came to a Hill which opening on the side let them in  Piper  and all so closed up again and they were never more seen or heard of to the great Lamentation of the Parents in that Town In memory whereof it was or∣dain'd that no musical Instrument should be sounded in the Street which led to the Gate through which they pass'd that no Ostery should be there held and that in the dating of all publick Writings the Year from the going forth of their Children should be added to that of our Lord Which they have accordingly ever since continued says our Author And this great Wonder happen'd the d of  July    Chapter the fourth  Of the Isle of  Albion  afterwards called  Britain  and now  England Scotland  and  Wales  And how it shewed to be Continent or firm Land with  Gallia  or  France  since  Noah'  s Flood  Here having shewn the dif∣ferent Opinions of the Derivation of the Word  Albion  from the  Greek  and  Latin  and from the Name of some chief Governor he proceeds to display the like variety of Con∣jectures  touching the Name of  Britain  from Sir  T Eliot Humphrey Lhuyd  and  Becanus  not withholding his own Opinion that the Island had the Name of  Britain  from  Brute  however many fabulous Circumstances may have been by a few obscure Authors heretofore added to this History and so have made the whole to be doubted of Next he sets forth the imagin'd Descents from the  Trojans  the Cause of which fond Conceits possessing so many he attributes to the want of Learning in former Ages their  Druids  them∣selves not having any Knowledge of Letters Our Author questions not only these Descents from the  Trojans  but the History of  Troy  itself shewing that Queen  Dido  never knew  Aeneas  who was dead a number of Years before she was born and that  Brute  was more probably a  Gaulish  Prince than a  Trojan  So proceeds to shew how this Island was anciently firm Land with  Gallia  naming several Authors of the same Opinion among whom are Sir  Tho More John Twine  and Dr  Richard White  also producing many Ar∣guments and Examples to maintain such a Conjunction and that there was an  Isthmus  which join'd our Island at  Dover  to  Calais  about six Miles wide whereby the Island was some time Peninsular Here we have several Instances of the Intrusions and Demolitions which have been made by the Waters how divers Steeples in the  Netherlands  do yet appear at Low Water of the Towns and Villages that have been drowned And that it is reasonable to think these flat and level Countries have been Sea the great Evenness thereof being so made by the Waters wherewith they have been cover'd This is proved by the Observations here made of the Shells and Bones of SeaFishes found two Fa∣thoms deep in these Plains distant from the Sea and we have here a Sculpture of some which our Author had seen As for the  FirTrees  found also buried in these  Netherlands  with the Roots commonly lying SouthWest as the Soil is not by nature apt to produce them our Author thinks they might be driven hither in the time of the Deluge Anchors are also observed to have been found deep in the Earth and the Skeleton of a SeaElephant in these Parts whence it is concluded that as these Parts of  Flanders  and  Brabant  are of Sea become Land and cannot by any In∣undation become Sea again it must be owing to the break∣ing of the  German  Ocean thro' that  Isthmus  which joined  Albion  to  Gallia  An Argument that this Separation from the Continent was since the Flood is urged from the great  Plenty of Wolves wherewith this Island was anciently in∣fested which no Man wou'd transport for the Goodness of the Breed out of the Continent into any Island no more than they will carry Foxes out of our Continent into the Isle of  Wight  They are therefore presumed to have passed over of themselves and grew most numerous till by King  Edgar  's Orders they were destroy'd throughout the Realm before whose time two  British  Kings  Madan  and  Mem∣pricius  had been killed by them  Chapter the Fifth  Of the Arrival of the  SAXONS  out of  Germany  into  BRITAIN  and how they received the Christi∣an Faith possessed the best Part of the Country called it  England  and leaving the Name of  Saxons  came generally to be called  Englishmen Here after a little Note upon  Brute  's Entrance into  Albion  about Years after the Creation and dividing  Britain  between his three Sons  Lo∣crine  who had  England Albanact  who had  Scotland  and  Camber  who had  Wales  we have a short Remark upon the Original of the  Scots  and another on the  Picts  shewing they were not so called from painting of their Bodies but from their being such notable Fighters Next we learn that the  Britains  were subject to the  Roman  Government from  Julius Caesar  to  Valentinian  the Third that is almost Years till relinquish'd by them they sought Protection in the second Year of King  Vortiger  against the  Scots  and  Picts  of the  Saxons  who then  Anno  arrived under  Hingistus  and  Horsus  in three great Ships to the number of ac∣cording to  Pomarius  And here we have a Sculpture repre∣senting their landing on the  British  Coast with those who were the first  Englishmen  in this Island and particular Accounts we here have of those two Leaders as to their Birth Arms Names Building and Settlement in  Kent  Also an Ac∣count of  Old England  or  Anglia  whence they came which was situate near  Sleswick  with the Signification of  Angle En∣gel  or  England  and that it was first caused to be so called by King  Egbert  Also of the other  Saxons  called  Vites  and  Juites  The Signification of  Wassail  The Creation of  Hingist  King of  Kent  The Arrival of a second Supply of  Saxon  Forces The Breach between the  Britains  and  Sax∣ons  The deposing of  Vortiger  enthroning of his Son  Vor∣timer  The Slaughter of  Horsus  and Return of  Hingist  into  Saxony  for more Forces  Vortiger  's Reascension of the Throne and Alienation from the  Saxons  The bloody Banquet on  May  Day at  Salisbury  Plain in which of  the  British  Nobility or more were treacherously massacred by the  Saxons  under  Hingist  at the watch Word  Nem eowr Seaxes  or take your Seaxes which was their Swords or crooked Daggers whence they derived their Name The Donation of  Kent  c to  Hingist  confirm'd and he reigned thirty four Years After the miserable Death of King  Vor∣tiger  we have a Series or short List of the  British  Kings and the Years of their Reign to the Death of  Cadwalladar  whose Reign ended when began six Kingdoms more of the  Saxons  in  Britain  So that in all with that of  Kent  they made an  Heptarchy  and they are here distinguished Here also we have the Names of several Places in  Britain  mention'd which were changed by the  Saxons  particularly of  London  that it was not so called by the  Britains  from  Luds∣town  Town being no  British  but a  Saxon  Word Besides then  Julius Caesar  wou'd have called it after that Name but it was so called from the famous metropolitan City of  Lunden  in  Sconia  some time of greatest Traffic in all the East Parts of  Germany  Nor that  Ludgate  was so call'd from King  Lud  be∣cause Gate also is no  British  Word but was call'd  Leodgeat  the Gate of the People or popular Passage in respect of the greater Concourse thro' the same than any other in those Days  York  the  Saxons  call'd  Euerwyc  and  Eberwyc  which by vulgar Abbreviation came to be  boric uoric  and so  York Euer  or  Eber  signifying a wild Boar and  Wye  a Refuge or Re∣treat those Beasts heretofore much infesting the Forest of  Gautries  within a Mile of the Town insomuch that there re∣mains a Toll call'd  GuidLaw  which is paid for Cattle at one of the Gates of the City which was granted for safe Conduct thro' the said Forest Here follow some Examples shewing how Auxiliaries or Assistants to distressed Inhabitants make themselves Sharers in their Country so returning to  Hingist  and his Successors we have a more particular Account of  Ethelbert  who was the fourth in Descent from him and the first of our  Saxon  Monarchs who embraced the Christian Faith and of certain  English  Pagan Children who being a few Years before sold at  Rome  were so admired by  Gregory  for their Beauty upon his hearing they were called  Angles  that he thought them not without reason so called for that as he said in allusion thereto they had Faces like Angels This St  Gregory  who was himself coming to  England  being af∣terwards made Pope sent St  Augustine  hither who landed in the Isle of  Tanet  where King  Ethelbert  resorted to him And here we have a Representation in Sculpture of the  said King on his Throne under a Tree with the Manner of St  Austin  's bringing and preaching the Christian Faith as described in  Bede  An Account of the said King's Con∣version and others of the  Saxon  Kings the Fruits thereof and their Manner of executing Deeds With an Obser∣vation that Years past our Language that of  Saxony  and the  Netherlands  were all one How our Country came in general to be called  England  by King  Egbert  about the Year with the Reason of our ancient Coin of  Angels  both thought to be promoted by the Allusion of  Gregory  aforesaid The Names of  Shires  given by King  Alfred  And why the Name of  Welshmen  was given to the  Britains  because they were of the ancient  Gauls  with several Ex∣amples from other Countries to illustrate the same  The sixth Chapter  Of the  Danes  and the  Normans  and their coming into  ENGLAND  and how the  ENGLISH  People have still retained the Body of the Realm  These  Danes  are here observed to have renewed their ancient Wars against the  Saxons  now after they had been  Bri∣tain  about Years and about Years after they were become the sole Possessors of that Part now called  England  Here we have an Account of the Antiquity of these People and the Cause of their invading this Country The Mar∣tyrdom of St  Edmund  The dividing of the Kingdom be∣tween  Canutus  the second King of  Denmark  and  Edmund Ironside  and by what Acquisitions that  Dane  became the greatest King for extent of Dominion that  England  ever had Of his Successors  Harold  and  Hardicanute  which three  Danish  Kings reigning about Years the Race of the  Danes  were expell'd and the  English  Line recovered again under  Edward the Confessor  who declared  Edgar  Heir of the Crown but  Harold  supplanting him wore it till he lost both it and his Life in Battle against  William  Duke of  Normandy  near  Hastings  in  Sussex  in  October  Thus we enter upon the History of the  Normans  From whence they issued That they were Robbers by Sea Of their o∣ther Invasions and their Cruelty therein Of  Rollo  's first coming into  England  and of the seven  Norman  Dukes from him down to that  William  His Resolution upon the En∣terprize of  England  with the three Causes thereof tho' the Crown was never intended him by  Edward the Con∣fessor  as by Reasons also appears The Particulars of this Expedition from  Megissier Oudegerst Crantzius  c His great Number of Ships The Place and Time of his land∣ing  and his Victory The Miseries of the  English  Nobility and Gentry thro' the Insolence of the  Normans  not unde∣served by such as rejected Prince  Edgar  the lawful Heir to the Crown The Honour of  Kent  The  English  flying into  Scotland  and their Tongue first spoken there The Union between the Crowns of  Scotland  and  England  The Revival of the  English  Credit and the Death of the Con∣queror after about Years Reign with an Account of his Burial and Epitaph in  Latin  and  English  A Computation that of the or Gentlemen he brought into  England  with him whose Names are in the Roll of  BattailAbbey  scarce one quarter of those Names are now remaining whence it is concluded that  Englishmen  are not such a mixed Nation as some suppose  The seventh Chapter  Of the great  Antiquity  of our an∣cient  English Tongue  and of the Propriety Worthiness and Amplitude thereof with an  Explanation  of sundry our most ancient  English Words Here it is asserted that the Ground of our  English  is the  Teutonic Tongue  and that this Language was undoubtedly that which at the Confusion of  Babel  the  Teutonic  People or those conducted by  Tuisco  did speak One Instance given is our using the Word  babble  or  babbling  from  Babel  when one speaks confused∣ly or vain Other Inferences from our Language being at first mostly Monosyllables Here we have an Account of  Becanus  his Opinion That the  Teutonic  was the Language  Adam  spake in  Paradise  with his Reasons from the Inter∣pretation of the Words  Adam Eve Cain Abel Seth E∣noch  c Also of  God Devil Heaven Hell Man Wo∣man  c Here we have the Authorities of  Toletanus  and  Lipsius  for the vast Extent of this ancient Language and a Censure upon the Wantonness of borrowing Words from the  French  or  Latin  in writing or speaking it Instances of this Age being given more to Variety than others An Example of the Nearness of our Language to the  Dutch  How  France  and  Spain  came to speak broken  Latin  Whence the Word  Romance  or  Romant  is derived Ex∣amples shewing the  Old French  and  Old English  were much alike from  Du Haillan Otfridus  his Preface to the Gospels translated about Years past and  Willeramus  the Ab∣bot his Translation into  Old French  of  Canticum Cantico∣rum  Of the  Norman  Mixture with our Tongue and that afterwards  Chaucer  was a great Mingler of  English  with  French  wherefore tho' our Author reverences him as  an excellent Poet for his Time he is not of their Opinion who call him the first Illuminator of the  English Tongue  and thinks he might have the greater Affection to the  French  Language because he was descended of a  French  or rather  Walloon  Race That since his Time more  La∣tin  and  French  have been admitted than left out of our Tongue From whence it is inferr'd that our Language is discredited by borrowing so much even to the making our selves unintelligible in our own Country as that super∣fine Orator did who declared That  "as he itinerated he obviated a rural Person and interrogating him concern∣ing the Transition of the Time and the Demonstration of the Passage found him a meer Simplician"  Never dreaming 'twas himself who made him so and that if he had ask'd him in plain  English  What it was o'clock And which was his way to the Place he wanted he might have had a satisfactory Answer As such Examples are apt to raise Derision even among our selves much more may Strangers be inclined to be merry with us at them since they have nought else for the Loan of their Words dis∣daining to borrow of our Store which we have rendered so obsolete and uncouth by despising the Use of it our selves As an Example of this Neglect our Author here gives an Alphabet of our most ancient  English  Words with their Ex∣planations in above thirty Pages and herewith concludes this Part  The eighth Chapter consists of  the Etymologies of the an∣cient  Saxon Proper Names  of Men and Women  This be∣gins with some general Rules to discern the  Saxon Proper Names  which leads us to the  Alphabet  of them contain∣ing above thirty Pages and concludes with some Remarks upon the Wisdom of our said Ancestors in the Choice and Significancy of them according to the Custom of the  Hebrews  who so adapted or had the like Propriety in their  Proper Names  The ninth Chapter shews  how by the  Surnames  of the Families of  England  it may be discerned from whence they take their Originals whether from the ancient  EnglishSaxons  or from the  Danes  or  Normans Here after ob∣serving how the  Saxons  having given Names to Places in  England  which Places afterwards gave Names to the Inha∣bitants the Method is preferr'd because our  Surnames  are infinite and it wou'd be tedious to specify a Multitude of them at length of chusing out the most usual Terminations  each to serve for a kind of general Rule how to appropri∣ate all such Names as do so end or more clearly distinguish thereby our ancient  English  Families beginning with those ending in  all  proceeding to those ending in  beke berie  and so thro' the whole Alphabet After this we have another Alphabet of our ancient Surnames which are of one Sylla∣ble and sometimes serving for Terminations of other Sur∣names Some also of two Syllables and not used to ter∣minate other Surnames At the end of this we have a ge∣neral Rule for the knowing of  English  Families which is if there be a  k  or a  w  in the Name neither the  Latin  nor any of the three Languages depending thereon using those Letters which sometimes causes Confusion in their writing of our Names A notorious Example whereof we have in our renowned Sir  John Hawkwood  who in the  Latin  Epitaph upon his Monument at  Florence  is written  Joannes Acutus  the  h  being left out as useless the  k  and  w  as unusual and so returned into  English  they have made  John Sharp  of him Here follows an Observation upon such Surnames as have been supposed to take their Original from the  Danes  And lastly the Surnames coming from the  Normans  the whole Chapter ending with a Remark upon the  British  or  Welch  Names which are thought to have been mixed with those of the  Romans  the  Britains  being under Subjection to these People about Years And hence concludes the honourable Family of  Cecils  being is∣sued from  Wales  is originally descended from the  Romans  The tenth and last Chapter treats  Of our ancient  English Titles  of  Honour Dignities  and  Offices  and what they signify Also the Signification of our  English Names  of  Dis∣grace  or  Contempt beginning in the first Part with the Name of King and ending with  Yeoman  and  Groom  And in the second Part beginning with  Baud  and ending with  Thief  And this with Notice of the  Table  or  Index  at the end of the special Points in the Book may give a sufficient View or Intimation of what is comprehended in the whole Work  We shall here take our leave of it with recommend∣ing whenever it arrives at another Impression those A∣nimadversions to be added or subjoined in their proper Places which have been since occasionally made on some Mistakes in it by some learned Searchers into our Anti∣quities As those made by Mr  Sheringham  on his Fancy of the  Vitae  being the ancient Inhabitants of the  Isle  of  Wight  on the  Saxons  being in  Germany  before they came into the more northern Countries and on  Tuisco  's coming from  Babel  and giving the Name to  Tuesday  But more especially should be admitted the Corrections of the learn∣ed Mr  Somner  he having left large marginal Notes upon  Verstegan  's whole Book as we are informed by Bishop  Kennet  the late accurate Author of his  Life  XLVII  The  FOUNDATION  of the  UNIVERSITY  of  OXFORD  with a Catalogue of the principal Founders and special Bene∣factors of all the Colleges and total Number of Students Magistrates and Officers therein  c Quarto Pages  THE accurate Author of this compendious Tract having recited the various Opinions which have been advanced about the time of the Foundation of this University which is justly reputed one of the most famous in the World says it is chiefly concluded and agreed that  Alfred  King of the West  Saxons  about the Year was the principal Founder thereof And tho' by Wars both before and since the Con∣quest its ancient Glory was much eclipsed yet so has it been restored by succeeding Princes and other Benefactors as to become conspicuous among the most famous Acade∣mies in  Europe  And however the  Hostels Halls Inns Schools  and Religious  Houses  whereof since the Conquest it did consist but now defaced or converted into the pre∣sent Foundations there were for their Number and that of the Students in them beyond those now extant yet true and solid Learning has latterly prevailed there more than ever and at this present there are eighteen goodly  Colleges  and  Houses  maintained with the Lands and Reve∣nues of their Founders and seven  Halls  where Students live at their own Charge Besides there are publick  Schools  and a  Library  whose Fabric by the Bounty of many royal noble and religious Persons was of late Years finished which no University in the World can in all Points parallel Here follows their Names the Times when and Persons  by whom they were founded with an Account of their present State  I  University College  Founded by King  Alfred Anno Dom  or in the second Year of his Reign and the Students were maintained out of the King's Exchequer till  William  the Conqueror took the same from them  Willi∣am  Archdeacon of  Durham  repaired and endowed it anew in and since by the Bounty of Dr  Walter Skirlaw Henry  Earl of  Northumberland Robert Dudley  Earl of  Lei∣cester Charles Greenwood  and others the Society and Re∣venues of this College are much encreased so that there is at present therein a Master eight Fellows one Bible Clerk with Officers Servants and other Students to the number of  II  Baliol College  Founded by  John Baliol  born in the Bishoprick of  Durham  and his Wife  Dervorgilla  Parents of  John Baliol  King of  Scots  giving thereto Lands and Re∣venues for maintaining a Master ten Fellows and eleven Scholars which is recorded to be the first endowed College in this University It has since by the Liberality of some Be∣nefactors here named and divers others been much enlarged and adorned The number of Fellows are at the Discretion of the Visitor Master and

to the Institution Arms and Characters of the  KNIGHTS  of the  GARTER  With the Ceremonies of the ancient  ORDER  of the  BATH  illuminated in their proper Colours  and adorn'd with the  Pourtraits  or  Limnings  of several  noble Personages  c Fol MS  THIS ancient and valuable Collection begins with a Copy of the  Interpretation  of and  Additions  to  the Statutes of the Order of the Garter  made by King  Henry  VIII with the Advice and Assent of the Companions of the said Order on the th Day of  May  in the eleventh Year of his Reign There are Additions and Interlineations in several Places of some Corrections or Amendments in the handwriting of Sir  Thomas Wriothesley  and is intitled at the top of one of the Pages  The now Statutes  This consists of nine Pages and is followed with  The Ordon∣naunces for the Officers of the Order  in the beginning of which the said King  Henry  is called  Renovator  of the no∣ble Order of St  George  in the th year of his Reign or This Part treats of the five Officers of the said Or∣der who are the  Prelate Chancellor Register King of Arms  called  Garter  and the  Huissier of Arms  named the  Black Rod  declaring the Charge or Duty of every one of them and their Privileges Habits Wages and Liveries also the Liberties and Privileges granted to the thirteen Poor Knights as is expressed in the Introduction thereof Moreover here are the Pourtraits or Limnings of these five Officers in their proper Robes and Ensigns of the Order and all in their proper Colours This Part fills eight Pages but there seems to be a Leaf wanting at the end because it breaks off abruptly in the Account of the Usher of the Black Rod and his Salary and there is wholly wanting the Privileges of the Poor Knights as before promised Next follows which perhaps should have been bound first in the Book a Translation of the first Founder King  Edward  's  Statutes of the Order  Beginning thus  "In the worshipp of God Seynt  Marie  the glorious Virgyn and Seynt  George  our Sovereygn Lord  Edward  the Thirde Kyng of  Englonde  aftir the Conquest the Yere of his Reigne hath ordeyned establisshed and founded in his Castell of  Wyndesore  a Company named  the Order of the Gartier  in the Maner as foloweth First Hymself Sovereygn his eldest Sone the Prince of  Walys  the Duke of  Lancaster  Therle of  Warwyke  the Captan of  Bueth  Therle of  Stafford  Therle of  Salisbury  the Lord  Mor∣tymer  Sir  John Lisle  Sir  Barthelmewe de Burghersh  the Sone of Sir  John Beauchamp  the Lord  Mahun  Sir  Hugh Courtnay  Sir  Thomas Holland  Sir  John Gray  Sir  Richard Fitzsymon  Sir  Miles Stapulton  Sir  Thomas Wale  Sir  Hugh Wryottesley  Sir  Neele Loryng  Sir  John Chandos  Sir  Jayms Dandeley  Sir  Oetes Holland  Sir  Henry Eme  Sir  Sauchett Daprichecourt  Sir  Walter Panell  And it is accorded"  c  These Articles are comprised in four∣teen Pages ending with these Words  "And also the said Colier shall not be sold put to pledge given nor aliened for neede or cause whatsoever that it be"  There are some marginal Notes on it in the same Hand as in the foregoing Draught and in the Margin at the End this Inscription TH WR  A R Greek  which as we have been inform'd by a very knowing Person in these Studies signifies  Thomas Wriothesley King of Arms of Grekelade  and under that in the same hand is also this Inscription  Sta∣tuta Regis H  VII  mi  tempore translata Anglice per  JO WR signifying that these Statutes were thus translated in the time of King  Henry  VII by  John Wriothesley  King of Arms Following this in the same Page there is written but in a∣nother Hand which has been supposed to be  John Stow's    Necessaryes of a strange Prince chosen a Brother and a Com∣panion of the Order of the Garter  Also  The Othe of a Kyng byeng a Stranger when he recevyth the Order of the Garter  After a Copy of an old Deed in another hand upon the next Leaf executed in the Reign of King  Edward  III we enter upon a View of the Arms and Crests of the Knights of the Garter blazon'd all in their proper Colours There may be near two hundred most of them finish'd in the compass of about seventy Pages and what is a very great Curiosity in a Work of this nature we have the Badges to about fourscore of them painted or drawn with a Pen against or at the sides of so many of the said Coats Fur∣ther what still inhances its value to the historical Inspector is that not only the Names of most of the Knights Com∣panions  are appropriated to the greater part of those Arms but Characters also given of upwards of threescore of them containing a short Account of their Actions Marriages Is∣sues Benefactions Death and Burial Which Particulars of such ancient Record as this Writing and these Draughts seem to be must be esteemed most authentic as being so near the original Fountains of Intelligence In the seventh Page of these Draughts we find against one of the Coats this Writing  "  John  King of  Portugal    li  Gowne JO WR"  and against the next  "  Maximilian  King of  Romains  transolatt to the Princs stall Gowne Clothe of Gold furred with Martres the Cape of  Bever  JO WR"  and against the next  "  Phillipp  King of  Castille  Archiduc of  Awstriche  Gowne Clothe of Gold lyned with Damaske  Scutes  for Dobelet TH WR"  The former part of this Work seems plainly as old as King  Henry  VII because in the third Page of these Draughts where his Arms and Badges are display'd it is thus written of him  "and  nowe gloriously reigneth owre Soveryne Lord King  Henry  the VII  whiche in his Youthe hathe endured many greate  Duresse  and blessed by God hathe wonne two great Bataillis the fyrst the Bataile of  Redmore  c the seconde the Bataile of  Stoke  c"  Yet four Leaves further we have this In∣scription over the Arms of that King's Son  "The Duc of  Yorc Henry  aftir Prynce and aftir King  Henry  the  Eight  wiche conqred the Cytes of  Terwen  and  Tourney  with their Appurtenances  Anno quinto R  "  From these Observations it may appear that Sir  John Wriothesley  Garter King of Arms was Author of some of these Cha∣racters and Sir  Thomas  who was Garter afterwards and died  Henry  VIII  Vide  Weever  's  Fun Mon  fol who says Sir  Thomas Wall  succeeded him that Year  Author of others and probably the greater part wherefore we have entitled the Collection to him  The principal

an∣cient Knights of the Garter down to about the middle of King  Henry  the VIII his Reign  On the second Page of the same Leaf where the former Work ends begins another of a different kind being nothing but Pourtraiture without any Introduction or verbal Ex∣planation and continues for twenty four Pages successively It contains a distinct Representation in so many painted Draughts of the ancient Ceremonies used in creating the  Knights of the Bath  The Figures in these Limnings tho' they are not every where in exact Proportion or finely finish'd off to the Eye are yet so very observable for the punctual Regard that seems to have been paid to the due Representation of all Parts of the Solemnity all proper Per∣sons that should appear all Officers and Attendants with all the Distinction of Habits Ornaments  c  that above fourscore Years since these Draughts were thought worthy of being graved and brought into Print  In  Nich Upton  de Studio Milit  c  Fol  Lond    wherefore we shall only observe further of them here that in the said Sculpture they are nothing so intelligent as in these the original Paintings because the whole Ceremony being con∣tracted all into one Sheet Print and the Colours all reduced to black and white we are deprived of several remarkable  Distinctions in the said Copy which in these Illuminations might give great Light to some Parts of our History and Antiquities  After these Views of this Ceremony we have two or three Tables or Genealogies of  Hungary  of the Kings of  Castille  and the  Fitzhardings  c Then we come to some Pourtraits of certain noble Personages two in a Leaf at full length painted in their proper Habits and Robes for twelve Pages together Among these are King  Edward  I and his Queen  Richardus de Monthermer  Earl of  Gloucester  and  Hereford  with  Joanna  Lady  Acres  his Wife Daughter of that King  Tho de Monthermer  his Son and  Edward  his Son Also  John  the Son of  William de Montacute  and  Margaret  Daughter of  Thomas de Monthermer John  Earl of  Salisbury  and  Thomas  his Son with their Countesses  Richard Nevyle  Earl of  Salisbury  and his Lady  Alice Richard Nevil  Earl of  Warwick  and  Anne  his Lady King  Richard  III and his Queen  Anne William  Lord  Ferres  of  Groby  and Lady  Mar∣garet  his Wife also the Duke of  Exeter  and his Dutchess Of which Pictures the Men being most of them in Ar∣mour have their Helmets closed over their Faces all but the two King  Richards  and  Thomas  and  Edward  Sons of  Richard de Monthermer  After these we have in four Pages more some unfinished Draughts of the Standard Bearers between two of which are some of the Knights Companions of the first and second Stall mention'd  Then follow a few Leaves of some Coats of Arms with∣out Crests or Badges and a  Pedigree  of  Dampetre Earl  of  Flanders  with a Draught of two or three monumental Fi∣gures And then we come to an Account of the  Fees that  William Brugys  alias  Garter  had of the Prelate and Knights of the Order besides the Sovereign  Which  Brugys  was in the time of King  Henry  V and King  Henry  VI in his Be∣ginning Also a Memorandum of about sixteen  Knights who were created Peers in the Reign of King  Henry  VI  and the Days when The next is a List of the  Knights of the Garter the Third of King  Edward  VI  in  French  but either the Account is not finished or the number of them were then but Eighteen including the Sovereign The next Piece is the  Pedigree of the Lord  Perse  of  Luxemburgh  Earl of Saint Poule  Towards the Conclusion of this Pedigree we learn that it was made for the Lady  Margaret Vaux  and that the Brother of this Lady was named  William  Lord of the  Vaux  who was then alive And further we have these  Words  "Lo now have ye the Pedigree of the Fader of the Moder of my Lady  Margaret  of the  Vaux  now be∣yng alyve Moder unto Therle of  Sent Powle  and unto  Thebaut  Lord  Fynes  now beyng Bisshop of  Manns  and of my Lord  Jakes  of  Lugburgh  and of the Doghter my Lady  Jaquetto  Duches of  Bedford  my Lady  Isabell  Countess of  Mayn  and of my Lady  Kateryn  Duches of  Britayn  now all beyng on lyve"  And here ends as we conjecture the ancient Collections in this Book which were made for the most part by the  Wriothesleys  that is all but a few of the odd Pedigrees and perhaps also one or two of the last Articles which are here mention'd For we observe all the Paper except one Leaf containing only an Illumination of some monumental Ornament and might be inserted at the last binding up of the Volume from the Be∣ginning of the Knights of the Garter's Arms to this Place has one Maker's Mark upon it  viz  Three  Flower de Luces  in a  Scutcheon  with a  Coronet  over it  What follows in this Volume bound into it by a later Owner are first two Sheets printed in Queen  Elizabeth  's time the one from a CopperPlate and is called  The Uni∣on of the Roses of the Families of  Lancaster  and  York With the  Arms  of those who have been chosen of the most Honora∣ble  Order  of the  Garter  from that Time to this Day It was composed that is the Arms and Dates were settled by  Thomas Talbot  a noted Antiquary of those Times and graved by  Jodocus Hondius  of  Flanders  in  London  the Year above∣mention'd The other Sheet is stuck upon Canvas and is so soil'd 'tis scarce legible but it contains a short Account in  Latin  of all the Orders of Knighthood Ecclesiastical or Civil that are famous thro' the Christian World I think it is dedicated to Dr  Tho Hesketh  by  John Clapham  There are further two  Latin  Tracts in this Volume which also never belonged originally to the aforesaid Collections but are both bound in with them Parchment Covers and all the one called  Libertates Collegii  The other contains the Accounts of  Owen Oglethorp  Treasurer of St  George  's Chapel from the last Day of  October  in the th of  Henry  VIII to the last of  September  in the first of King  Edward  VI The rest of the Book consists only of several Sheets of the printed Titles and painted Arms of some Knights of the Garter in King  Charles  the Second's time such as are usu∣ally dispersed at their Installations and only bound in here at the End to make it a Volume as portly and magni∣ficent  to outward Appearance as it is intrinsically valuable The Care of thus gathering and binding together these Col∣lections is owing to that eminent Antiquary and Herald Mr  Elias Ashmole  whose Book it appears to have been by the Impression of his Arms which we see on the Cover But the Liberty of thus obliging the Publick with the Contents of it we owe to the gracious Favour of a noble Peer who is most worthily possessed thereof having besides the Ge∣nerosity of this Communication also been at no small Ex∣pence in honouring the Memories of those illustrious Per∣sonages whose Pourtraitures are before mention'd  L  A  DEFENSATIVE  against the Poyson of supposed  PROPHE∣SIES  Not hitherto confuted by the Penne of any Man which being grounded eyther uppon the  Warrant  and  Au∣thority of olde  paynted Bookes Expositions  of  Dreames Oracles Revelations Invocations  of  damned Spirits Ju∣dicialles  of  Astrologie  or any other kinde of pretended Knowledge whatsoever  de futuris contingentibus  have been Causes of great  Disorder  in the  Commonwealth  and chiefly among the  Simple  and  Unlearned  People  c London  printed by  John Charlewood  Printer to the Earl of  Arundell  Quarto Pages  THIS Work replenish'd with Variety of learned Autho∣rities from the Ancients and historical Examples of all Times is dedicated to Sir  Francis Walsingham  from  Ho∣ward  House by  Henry Howard  afterwards Earl of  North∣ampton  and Lord  Privy Seal  The noble Author ingeni∣ously bespeaks the Patronage of his Friend in the said De∣dication by introducing it with an Allusion from  Vitruvius  who allows  "no Building to be fully finished which wants a Cover to bear out a Storm"  Therefore having made an end of this rude Pile presumes to grace it with the  Lou∣ver  of his honourable Name Further confessing his par∣ticular Affection and Zeal to him was so much increased from his stedfast Friendship in the Days of Proof that not only his Hand was ready to subscribe but his Heart with∣all to acknowledge the great Merit of his undeserved Fa∣vour  For who may be more securely trusted in the Port of Liberty than he that once vouchsafed with a favourable Hand to waft him out of the Surges of uncertain Chance And a little further we observe that from the sixteenth Year of his Age till this Day his Custom had been in the Course of his Reading to store up all such Reasons and Ex∣amples as occurr'd in Philosophy the Civil Laws Divinity or Histories to the Ruin of pretended Prophets and their Prophesies The Readers of whose Censure he is most ap∣prehensive are of three Sorts The first looking not into the Subject but the Writer with such Partiality that  Battus  shall sooner be crowned with Laurel if he bear their Li∣very than  Homer  with an Ivy Garland  c  The second Sort are the close sullen Censors who injure no less by si∣lent Scorn and malicious Innuendos than by open Exclama∣tions And the last kind are the false Prophets and their Favourites who neither upon Spleen against the Writer nor overweening of themselves but only with a mortal Fear lest their  Diana  should be robb'd of her silver Shrine are like to bend their whole Endeavour against the Con∣tempt of their inveterate Abuses This is followed with some curious Reflections upon the Vanity of Prophesies and Oracles by the utmost Pretensions whereof we cannot alter the determinate Course which is prefixed in the Provi∣dence of God nor prognosticate of any future Accident We may change our Vessel like Seasick Passengers but not our Pain our Bed but not our Fit our Climate but not our Quality For he that stinted and confined us to Go∣vernment upon the Ground forbade us as it were by Con∣sequence  ambulare in Mirabilibus  and he that made us ig∣norant of many present Matters for our own Behoof would not entangle us with Guesses and Conjectures  de futuris  for a greater Inconveniency The Trees which are most backward in putting forth their Blossoms prosper long whereas Almonds are most commonly decay'd and starv'd by the Frost for putting out before their Fellows Of Time past there is no Comfort of Joy present no Stay of Chance future no Certainty Why then should not all Sorts of feigned Prophets look into the Devil's Craft Who deals like the Eagle with a Shellfish or a cunning Wrestler with his Mate in hoisting us up to the nicest and most fickle Points that afterwards the Fall may be more dangerous and his Prey easy which would never come to pass if Men would look into the Works of God with the Eyes of Hum∣bleness  not pry into the Secrets of his Purpose with the Spectacles of VainGlory  c  Then after submitting to the Judgment of his said Patron whether this Work should be destroy'd or committed to the Press and praying that he might be blessed with his heavenly Favour in as ample Mea∣sure as himself had tasted of his honourable Friendship he concludes this  Dedication  which is followed with a short  E∣pistle  to the  Reader  Wherein we perceive he has reformed to advantage his first proposed Method of dispatching all his Answers to the several Branches of Prophesy together in one Mass or Lump before the winding up of the Dis∣course by answering every Part distinctly under its proper Head for good Reasons here given After which he had some Thoughts of detecting the false Virtues and Properties imposed upon Herbs and Stones but considering how de∣spicable these Abuses were held in the Days of  Sozomen  and that such Fantasies come never further out of Season than when grave Matters are debated with Authority he pur∣sued no further this Purpose So closes his Epistle with his good Wishes to his Reader  The Work it self is introduced with the Story of  Ulysses  loitering with  Circe  the Sorceress in his return from  Troy  and the Confession of  Echinis  a reputed Prophet how vain all Pretensions are this Way Here we have a Division of  Prophesies  into divers Kinds with a Rejection of them and a compendious Way offer'd to be satisfied in the Ju∣stice of such Treatment thereof First by pointing out the Causes which induce Men to embark their Hope on so faithless a Bottom as that of Prophesies Secondly by disproving all these Kinds thereof to make it appear what Pains have been taken to seduce the illiterate and unthink∣ing Part of Mankind Thirdly by shewing how our ad∣hering to such Vanities is inconsistent with the Duty of a true Subject or a good Christian from which  Data  or Prin∣ciples is to be known what kind of Prophets may be tole∣rated in a State Fourthly and lastly by giving a full An∣swer to such Arguments as have been used in Defence of such Practices The first Cause then is a Desire in Man to soar above the State he was put in by God Secondly a Distrust of God while we think he is not as willing by his Mercy as able by his Might to help us Thirdly a Credu∣lity in being apt to believe things we wish may come to pass Also shewing that many Times there needs no more to the making a Prophet than a natural and easy Deduc∣tion  of an Effect from a Cause with several Instances here∣of Fourth and lastly an Impatience to know beforehand the Revolutions of Government  c  Here we have some Reflections on the Burden of Honour the Depravity of Ambition and Vanity of Divination that it is unwarranted both by Divinity and Philosophy That if Reason cannot compass it neither will any other Principle in Man and in what Cases he may be provident but not prophetic That Melancholy is insufficient to qualify Men with this Fa∣culty And that Passion is the Parent thereof as  Porphiry  maintain'd is proved erroneous Hence we pass to  Chap II Of  Dreams Plato  the chief Patron of them No Certainty to be gathered from any Thing he has writ on this Head  Aristotle  nearer the Truth who maintains That the Limits of our Knowledge are adequate only to the Strength or Abilities of the Soul which in its present State being always immersed in Matter  c  seems unable upon the Reception of Images in sleep to judge whether they are answer'd by any Thing external or no If Sleep were a Means to discover Things to come then the sounder and deeper the Sleep the greater would be the Discovery but we find contrariwise that Things of Moment are revealed in slumbers This Kind of Divination moreover is contin∣gent to the Vulgar and not to the best and wisest sort of Men and Dreams are the Amusement also of Infants and even Brutes as well as human Creatures The most affecting often broken confused and effaced out of the Memory Af∣ter some Reasons of the Ancients for raising our Regard to Dreams we have our Author's for not heeding them As That since they are so soon forgot the Print they make must needs be shallow That no judicious Man will chuse Fancy for his Guide but Dreams are Fancies If Al∣legories please us  Apollo  's Robe was of Purple with a Gloss not shadowy The Gods are wont to reveal their Mysteries to Men sober and discreet but we find none dream more than the Fickle and Ungodly God who is Purity itself will not make Dreams the Shadows of his ordinary Grace We may not expect him to give so fair a Colour for Man to depend more upon the Pride of his Nature which is frail than upon the Rule of Providence which is certain To be exploded as what would be Causes of Strife and Debate And withdraw our Mind from our Duty As they could not be distinguished the Certain from the Frivolous As they could not be  valued for Grounds of Truth without detracting from the sacred Majesty and lastly As we are not to measure Truth by the Line of Imagination Moreover if any Aim were to be taken or Guide design'd from Dreams some Interpreters would be found so expert that we could not err but they appear not And tho' the Events should answer some Expositions who can say this is not Chance As for admitting some Dreams to have been suggested by An∣gels they cannot be admitted for ordinary Dreams therefore make not for the Diviner's Trade And since neither any Dreams bring one Effect to divers Persons nor to the selfsame at all Times it may be taken for a senseless Practice to justify the Follies of a number by the Events of some And con∣cerning God's not revealing himself by this Means as well now as he may have anciently done here are Reasons given to shew that his Will in this Point is not correspond∣ent with his Power Hence we proceed to  Chap III Of  Oracles  And here we have the ridicu∣lous Accounts which the Heathens gave of Divinations thereby exposed With  Cicero  's Notion That the Mind being inspired or blown up by certain Vapours or Exhala∣tions deliver'd those Oracles And  Cotta  's Question to the Collectors of  Apollo's  Offering  viz  If he were a God why did he shrowd himself in the Bowels of the Earth That the Island  Delphos  where stood the Idol of  Apollo  was inspired by Exhalations from the Ground as main∣tained by  Plutarch  but disproved by our Author who ascribes the Prophesies from such Effect more to the Plough∣men than the Priests His Comparison of the Fable which supposes the first Prophet to have been found by Chance in an old Vault in  Hetruria  to the Tale in  Nubrigensis  concerning two young Children brought to  Wolpet  in  Suf∣folk  with an Eastern Wind The Answer of  Apollo  's Proc∣tors to the Question of some Philosophers why  Delphos  remaining the same in Substance Situation and Quality as usual was notwithstanding deprived of the Virtue of afford∣ing Oracles if Exhalations were interested in the Cause With the Shift of  Demetrius  upon this Objection Also the Argument of a wild Man for the Silence of this Ora∣cle who said  Apollo  was doing Penance for certain Fami∣liarities with  Daphne  c So could not attend as usual to the giving out Oracles  Cicero  confesses this Silence but evades the Debate of the Cause And the Opinions of o∣thers  are produced but the coming of  Christ  is concluded to be the real Occasion of such Silence  Chap IV Of  Astrology  Its Definition That the Houses Faces Images Aspects  c  which it ascribes to Planets are neither apparent to Sense nor revealed in Philosophy That it is impossible for one or all the Planets to suppress the Properties of Nature as that a Child which is born under a frowning Planet should never laugh A cold Pro∣perty in Planets vainly asserted The  Peripatetic  Principle that no Planet the Moon excepted changes Property but by regard of Place The Opinion of others that all Planets are favourable in their Kind but forced to degenerate by Malice in the Bodies on which they work That they work according to the Matter which they find without giving a second Nature or correcting the first The Rea∣son why St  Augustine  renounced this Study of the Stars with the ridiculous Subdivision of the  Zodiac  by the Pre∣tenders to this Art The Conceits about the  Aspects  of the Planets sufficiently shaken by this Rule in Philosophy That the Disposition of divers Causes tending to one certain End cannot forego their Virtue by meer Distance and nothing else Things sublunary only subject to Passions and Affec∣tions and therefore not the supream Bodies or their Beams as Astrologers imagine Upon what the Consideration of  Aspects  depends The Notion of Aspects taken up in the Author's Opinion from the sundry Shapes and Figures of the Moon Next is the Divination from certain Parts of a Planet confuted by the Authority of its Inventors That the  Chaldees  admitted but eleven Signs the Forms of which accounted for by our Author The absurd Reasonings of Astrologers from these Signs as also their Inability to ac∣count for supposed Images in the Front or Face of every Sign with their want of Reason or Authority for culling out only a certain number of fixed Stars as influential  Ptolemy  's allowing to the Planets ordinary Luck but to the fixed Stars Happiness inconceivable  Bonatus  his Shift a∣gainst the Objection drawn from the Use of only a certain number of Stars followed by the Reason why Philosophers defined Chance and Fortune to be Causes not in themselves but by Accident The Argument That Events which draw their Virtue rather from the Means which happen by the way than from the first Intent from Fortune than from Foresight seem to be brought to pass by Chance al∣together in respect of us objected to by a Comparison  which in no wise holds  viz  That we may guess at the Course of Things by poring on the Stars as well as a Car∣penter at the Goodness of a Frame by knowing the Timber Wherefore all Knowledge from remotest Causes as from the Planets is obscure  Plato  tho' nearest the Truth when he says That all Planets are benevolent is yet opposed by the Planetarians to keep up their Scheme No prescribing with certainty where upon one Change so many others follow as in this Art The Divisions of Astrologers in their Fundamentals Also a Question put to them Whether touching Things which are perfected in Time we should guess according to the Minute wherein the Work is first conceived in our Thought or when it is begun or when it is perfected or when only part and not the whole is finished Some Opinions herein with the Application of the Question As that since the time of Conception is un∣certain we must take our Aim by that of the Birth as the only Mark we have to guide us  Haly  's Attempt to prove the time of Conception and Birth to be the same with the divers Accidents concurring before we can take the certain Minute of any Birth The absurd Reply of some hereto Com∣monwealths also as presumed to have their Fates the Ob∣ject of these Pretenders They are question'd again whe∣ther they believe that Influence they talk of univer∣sal from all the Heavens or from the Planets only Shew∣ing that it pinches them which way soever they take it And after observing that the Angels know nothing but as God has revealed it to them concludes we must be Fools in thinking that any Thing can be discerned in an  Ephemeris  which is but the Device of Man Here we en∣ter upon the Arguments to be drawn from Experience upon this Subject and after its Definition we have the Reasons why it will make nothing in favour for astrological Divina∣tions That from the Flights of  Birds  and Bowels of  Beasts  Guesses and Inferences were sometimes answered by Events but not from the Influence of those Things which were sup∣posed to be the Causes Thus tho' a War should follow an  Eclipse  we may find a more real and rational Cause Next we have an Examination of the dreaded Events of  Comets  How divided the Opinions of the Ancients about them The Objection drawn from Experience of  Comets  that have brought forth one Effect answered That nothing can be predicted from them because of their Inconstancy in time and place of Appearance Motion Figure Continuance  Qualities  c  The Arguments for their denoting the Deaths of Princes disproved in every Branch That they have died oftner after the glaring of a Rainbow That many great Princes here named had not their Deaths foretold by any Comets Observations on the Plenty and Prosperity that rather follow'd them and Health exemplify'd in Queen  Elizabeth  who never was in better State of Body than during the twenty five Years of her Reign in which many Comets appear'd And here our Author affirms as an EyeWitness  "That when divers scrupulously dissuaded her Ma∣jesty at  Richmond  from looking at the Comet which ap∣peared last in with a Courage answerable to the greatness of her State she caused the Window to be set open and cast out these Words  Jacta est alea The Dice are thrown  Affirming that  her stedfast Hope and Confi∣dence was too firmly planted in the Providence of God to be blasted or affrighted with those Beams which either had a Ground in Nature whereon to rise or at least no Warrant in Scripture to portend the Mishaps of Prin∣ces  Behold a Woman and a Queen which seem to be the Kinds and Callings upon which the Comets if A∣strologers speak Truth are wont to prey and yet she not only relenteth not to common Fear but insulteth rather upon common Folly Then we have a fine Compliment paid to her Majesty for her numerous Virtues which might make her an Exception to the common Rule because  Wisdom governs the Stars  "  Next we have the Fancies of those who ascribe the Cause of Earthquakes to Planets condemned with an Answer to the Demand why we may not as lawfully seek out the Properties of Stars as of Stones Metals  c  Shewing that to search for that in the Sky which may be found nearer hand is repugnant to Philosophy And because some countenance their Preten∣sions by  Astronomy  'tis here distinguish'd what Parts of Na∣ture this Science considers and in what Manner the Rules or Propositions of any Art should be lawful true and agree∣able to Nature which cannot be found in Astrology Ar∣guments taken from Physick Physiognomy and Naviga∣tion to prove it an Art of no avail Against the Assertion that it is impossible to gather any certain Knowledge of Things which are brought forth by the Concourse of divers disunited Accidents 'tis affirm'd by the other side Poverty Sickness Death  c  should rather bear the Name of Ad∣herents than of Accidents forasmuch as they claeve to  the Subject having a certain Foundation or Ground at the Bottom of our Natures and the falsity of this Affirmation exposed Did Planets convey such Qualities and Influences as are pretended then must they work the like Effects on Beasts No Credit to the Art that  Aristotle  affirms these lower Parts or Earth do confine upon the higher nor that Persons inhabiting under the Meridian are exceeding timo∣rous effeminate  c  Nor lastly what  Melanchton  affirms That Children which are born in the eighth Month never live The Doctrine of Inundations Plagues  c  proceed∣ing from the Contagion of the Air the Air receiving this Contagion from the Planets and the Planets being the Causes of our Misery consider'd and answer'd by a parallel Case of the Heart in Man  Haly  's Instance also of Floods and parching Heats from Planets being some cold others hot excepted to With the Author's Advice to welldisposed Wits to direct their Enquiries only to Things that may be known  Chap V  Of Conference with Familiars or damned Spirits  Herein is set down the belief of some That there neither is certain Hell nor shall be Spirits till the latter Day How∣ever the Existence of Spirits argu'd for To dispute about the Manner or Mean where the Messenger is wicked or the Message false wou'd be needless The Means where∣by Spirits may be thought to guess at Things future pro∣posed in several Instances That the Illusions of  Sedechias  the deceitful  Jew  presented before  Lewis  the Emperor and of others ought not to seem strange since the Works of God are far more deep And since  Scotto  the  Italian  Jug∣ger could play such Slights before Queen  Elizabeth  that those who undertook to discry them were no less beguiled than the rest who presumed less upon their own Penetra∣tion 'tis thought we may deem Familiars to be more fine and nimble Further of these incorporeal Messengers as the  Demon  of  Socrates  the Spirit that daily called upon  A∣laricus  and that named  Orthon  which brought Intelligence from all Corners of the World to  Gaston  Earl of  Foix  as  Froissart  has at large and perhaps too largely related Some Arguments in defence of Familiars and wicked Spi∣rits consider'd and refuted But the Abettors of this Art being at a Nonplus for want of Reasons to defend the same appeal to the pretended Apparition of  Samuel  and tell us that as the Sorceress called him up so surely may the Con∣jurers of these Times invoke the Souls of godly Men But  our Author denies that it was the real  Samuel  If it be urg∣ed Why are Conjurers sometimes so desirous of a dead Hand as  Athanasius  was accused to have cut off that of  Arsenius  to abuse with magical Practices or that a Hair a Pin  c  is desired by wicked Spirits and Witches of the Parties they would have Power over 'Tis answer'd the Gift is naked and impotent unless vested with Consent The Hand no more able to sway the Soul than the Fore∣castle of a Ship to guide the Stern that the Belief is rather craved than the Benevolence the Heart than the Hand the Trust than the Token That the Souls of Men indeed sleep not after death but Bodies do and shall not be awak∣ed before the Knell which rings all in to Condemnation or Paradise Wherefore he concludes That neither Souls nor Bodies can appear to Conjurers but by a Figure or Sha∣dow of Illusion so far as it may take a seeming Colour by the Practice of our Enemy and shews how unlikely it is in the Case of  Samuel  That either God should suffer a Pro∣phet of his own chusing to turn Deceiver as  Samuel  cer∣tainly had been had he deliver'd himself to  Saul  in such Terms as the Spirit did or that the Devil by his nicest Art could restore a Body to its former Shape which was long before this dissolved to Dust and Ashes  Chap VI  Of the Cabalistick Art  Its Antiquity Mean∣ing and why so called The two Species thereof defined From these Definitions hardly conceivable how this Art can afford either Help or Credit to the Prophet Here we have an Account of the Conference held by our noble Au∣thor six Years before with one  Brocado  a  Jew  then in the Court who was a Pretender to this whimsical Art of expounding the Scriptures and from thence took upon him to divine what Fortune should betide the  Low Coun∣tries  as he said he had foretold what should befall  Paris  at least five Years before the Massacre fell out But our Author among other Arguments told him  "That Ex∣amples which fell out by Chance were never current where the Cause was to be justified by Reason And therefore till he could as readily product a certain Ground to make his Guesses good as score up a Register of blind Events I must says he rather praise his Luck than his Learning for as well might he prognosticate that the  Cockpit  in  Shoelane  should sink on the third of  June  because a Theatre fell down about that time at  Rome  in the Reign of  Claudius  as that either  Antwerp  or  Paris  should be plagued by the Pattern of  Edom  or  Samaria  We may be generally taught by the Precedents of God's righteous Judgments upon former States that whosoever sins or transgresses against either Table of the Moral Law should either be corrected by his Justice or for∣borne by his Mercy but by whether of these Means God purposeth to cure the Carbuncle of Man's Iniquity is concealed from our Knowledge and therefore were it vain to guess what his Pleasure is to execute The safest Course is to suspect the worst because Extremities are due but yet we cannot determine and resolve of nei∣ther"  Chap VII  Of the Scripture Authorities for Prognostication  Shewing how in several Instances it is there prohibited The falsity of the Assertion made by the Pretenders to these Arts That they never make Enquiries into any thing unlawful The  High German  's Proof of the Certainty of StarDivinity in the Warning given to Frier  Savanorola  by  Bellantius  the Astrologer exposed evidencing how vain and ineffectual such Warnings are since what is de∣creed by Destiny cannot be prevented by Intelligence Then the Enquiry is made Whether the Warning that this Frier should be put out of the way for Heresy were true or not If he affirm it to be true then must he grant that Doctrine to be Heresy which himself and his Country main∣tain against  Rome That the Pope's Pardons are of no Ef∣fect That he abuses his Authority  c For these were the Matters in defence whereof  Savanorola  died If he deny these Articles to deserve the Name or Note of Heresy which either he must do or confess himself a Heretick then it is evident that  Bellantius  was very much beguiled in be∣lieving or advertising that  Savanorola  should be swept away for ungodly Doctrine The Case is passing hard which drives a Man either to renounce his Faith or to forsake his Fancy Were there a Register among the Stars we need∣ed not to seek the Scripture for our Order but the Planets for our Fortune In the Moderns to say they regard the Stars as Means only by which God brings his Decrees to pass and so ought not to be set upon a Level with the An∣cients who look'd upon them as Gods will not serve and wherefore Observations on the two next Centuries after  Christ  being rifest with Miracles as the Air is warmest at the setting of the Sun and the People apter to believe the Gifts and Doctrine of Miracles the fresher their Sufferings  were who propagated them The Antiquity of  Astrology  examined with its Derivation The Singularity of  Porphiry  who alone of all the Philosophers gave into it And the vain Assertion of  Melanchton  That  Moses Essay c  impugn not all kind of Divination but rather the Pride of Man in presuming to understand those Secrets which are reserved to God alone as the  LastDay  c The Objections drawn from Scripture as  Moses  being learned in the Mysteries of  Egypt  and from these Words  Mine Hour is not yet come  c and from the Star which conducted the wise Men at the Birth of  Christ  consider'd and answer'd  Cardan  's Er∣ror in assigning the Hour of that Birth with the foolish reasoning of him and others from the Face of the Heavens at that time The Knowledge of  Seth Abraham c  urged in vain since their Remarks of the heavenly Orbs tended to the Knowledge of their Courses Eclipses c for the Distinction of Times and Seasons so needful in the Observance of their religious Feasts and Ceremonies Wherefore some have gather'd from certain Expressions in Scripture That the Tribe of  Issachar  was bound by Order to the Study of the Stars as divers Colleges in  Cambridge  are enjoin'd by the Statutes of the Founders to give Allow∣ance to certain Persons for this End  The Remainder of the Volume is a Collection of Argu∣ments Authorities and Histories further detecting the De∣lusions of these pretended Prophets and their Ambition in all times of supplanting what is certain in God's Providence by what is probable in Man's Conjecture Their Subtilty herein further laid open Their little Arts Shifts and E∣quivocations to gain themselves Profit and Honour where they happen to be lucky in their Predictions and shelter or subterfuge where they answer not what they had raised the Apprehensions of Mankind to expect with abundance of Examples to prove how justly such presumptuous Impos∣tures deserve the Detestation of all sober and ingenuous Men as conducing to the Miscarriage of so many Under∣takings which have depended on their Authority Also pointing out the various Means of discerning such Counter∣feits which by how much more successfully they have de∣luded the Generality in all Ages past should so much more effectually arm the Future with Precaution Among these Examples in this concluding Part we cannot be here fur∣ther particular than to mention those of  Manfredus  the A∣strologer who promised an  Italian  Prince many Years Life  and that he himself should live to discover many Wonders by his Art but died in the approaching Spring before he could declare them The Experiment of the Earl of  Arun∣del  who would note in his Almanacks the Changes of the Weather every where contrary to what had been asserted by the Writers of them and found his own Predictions oftner true than theirs The Persages of Dearth in confuted by its proving a plentiful Year The Disappoint∣ment of the  Abbot  who built him a House on  HarrowHill  to secure him from the threatned Deluge when it proved a Year of great Drought The Delusions by Figures and Images in the old painted Manuscripts and in the Herald's Books and those pretended to be preserved in religious Houses as  Merlin  's Prophecies which were chain'd to the Desks in many Libraries The Use made of Women in these prophetick Cozenages Thus  Montanus  wrought by  Maximilla  the  French  by their  Pucelle de Dieu  and our  English  Anabaptists by their  Holy Maid of  Kent The vain Presumption of  Verdungus  a Prophet in the Reign of King  Henry  VIII Instances of the Ruin of several Princes by adhering to the Advice of Magicians Astrologers and Pro∣phets Other late Instances of some learned  English  Men deluded thereby How  Bellantius  who predicted  Savano∣rola  's Execution could not foresee his own When Car∣dinal  Wolsey  superstitiously avoided  Kingston  upon  Thames  tho' his ready Way from  Asher  to the Court for a quibbling Prophecy that  Kingston should be his End  Was it not a ly∣ing Prophecy For even Sir  Anthony Kingston  to whose Custody the Cardinal was committed proved not his End nor brought him to the Tower as he was charged for he died of his Illness at  Leicester  And the Rood of  Darvill Gathren  how did it burn a  Forrest  according to the  Welsh  Prophecy that it should When in scorn to superstition the Lord  Cromwell  burnt a Fryer with that Image But we might quote half the Book to mention the Examples of this kind wherewith it is all over so elaborately embellish'd which would have been much easier commanded had it been furnished with a  Table  or  Index  whereof the second Edition in Fol is also deficient but we hope it will be supply'd therewith if ever this Work arrives at a Third  LI  ANCIENT FUNERALL MONUMENTS  within the united Monarchie of  GREAT BRITAIN IRELAND  and the  ISLANDS  adjacent with the dissolved  MONASTERIES  therein contained Their  FOUNDERS  and what eminent  PERSONS  have been in the same interr'd Also the

 Authors Records Leiger Books Charters Rolls old MSS  and the Collections of judicious  Antiquaries  Whereunto is prefix'd a  Discourse  of  FUNERAL MONUMENTS c  by  JOHN WEEVER Fol Pages besides Preface Index  c  THIS Collection of Antiquities is adorn'd with a neat Frontispiece representing the Figures of Death and the Resurrection Also with another Sculpture of the Author in a laced Cap with his Hand on a Skull round the same there is an Inscription in  Latin  shewing that he was fifty five Years of Age at this time that the said Work was publish'd and at the bottom four  English  Verses informing us he was born in  Lancashire  and educated in the University of  Cambridge  Both which Prints were engraved by  Thomas Cecil  The Work is inscribed by the Author to King  Charles  and in his Preface or Epistle to the Reader we find he had not only observed what Honour Foreign Nations had re∣ceived by thus putting into print their monumental Antiqui∣ties but that he had with painful Expences travell'd over most Parts of  England  and some Part of  Scotland  to collect the Funeral Inscriptions of all the Cathedral and Parochial Churches But being much discouraged to proceed by the many malignant and avaricious Defacements he beheld of those venerable Remains and the many Obstructions and Troubles he met with from petulent Officers and Church∣wardens for want of a Commission he had Thoughts of burying all in silence till he was animated afresh to pub∣lish  what he had thus gather'd by  Augustus Vincent  Esq  Windsor  Herald and Keeper of the Records in the Tower Sir  Robert Cotton  newly dead on whom we have here a  La∣tin  Elegy set forth Sir  H Spelman  Sir  Simon D'Ewes John Selden  Esq  besides Sir  Richard  and Sir  Henry St George John Philpot  and  W Le Neve  Esqrs From all whom he had Assistance which encouraged him thus to finish this first Part and to compleat the rest of the Work now in good forwardness he intreats the Communications of the Publick  But the Reason why we had not the Author's said Continua∣tion of this Work was that he died the next Year after this first Part was printed as  Anthony Wood  informs us  The remainder of this Epistle contains Advice to the Tombmakers that they would be careful to pre∣serve the Inscriptions which they engrave with some Apo∣logies for extolling the ardent Piety of our Forefathers in these their Ecclesiastical Liberalities and for the Method he has pursued his Punctuality in following the ancient Ortho∣graphy and the Possibility of some Errors which may have escaped thro' his having had the Helps and Collections of many and others thro' the common Fate of the Press whereof the greatest he had met with he has amended  But there are yet left several which are very material especially in the  Numerical  Letters and Figures of the said Inscriptions which are as to those Particulars often erroneous as Mr  Wharton  in  Angl Sacra  Part I Page has observed Whether chargeable upon our Author's own Transcripts or those of his Friends tho' not distinguishable so as to fix the Imputation of Ignorance or Negligence upon him yet be the Defect in one or the other the  Chronological  Readers are e∣qually liable to be misled To apprise those Readers whereof was one Reason for our present Review of this Book as another Reason is to oblige  historical  Readers with the Notice of many eminent Persons characterised therein from ancient and credible Authorities  So concludes with a Distich from  Chytraeus  warning us from the Funerals of so many others in one Book to con∣sider the Certainty of our own  Then follows  The Discourse of Funeral Monuments  which comprises Pages and is divided into  eighteen Chapters  The First treats of Monuments in general From the an∣cient Poets and some of the Moderns as  Du Bellay Spen∣ser  and  Drayton  Of Funeral Monuments Graves Tombs or Sepulchres Of the ancient Custom of Burials  Epitaphs and other Funeral Honours from several ancient Authors Of Sepulchres answerable to the Degree of Persons deceased the various Manner of bearing them to the Grave and when both Sexes began to be borne alike Of the excessive Expences bestowed at Funerals in for∣mer Times Why so many have made their own Mo∣numents in their Lifetime The Care generally taken for decent Burial That the Burial of the Dead is acceptable to God with an Hymn to that purpose by  Prudentius  translated by Sir  John Beaumont  Of the ancient Care and Cost in preserving the Bodies of the Dead with strange Customs and Fashions of Burial Of Cenotaphs

written by  Alex Esseby  and those of  Strode  in  Kent  for a Contempt of  Tho Becket  and his Horse in cutting off his Tail born with Tails of Horses or other Beasts according to the foolish Assertion of  Pol Virgil  These Archbishops thus canonized of whom we have here a short History or Character are thirteen in number ending with St  Edmund  who died And this Part concludes at Page with some Observations upon the Enlargement of the Archbishoprick and the Con∣tentions between  Canterbury  and  York  for the Primacy Hence we pass to  Ancient Funeral Monuments within the Diocesse of  RO∣CHESTER  "This Bishoprick says our Author is so over∣shadowed by the nearness and greatness of the See of  Canterbury  that it looks but like a good Benefice for one of his Grace's Chaplains yet for Antiquity and Dignity of a long Succession of Reverend Lord Bishops it may equally compare with its Neighbour of  Canterbury  "  For they had both one Founder  Ethelbert  King of  Kent  who built this Church to the Honour of St  Andrew  and endowed it whereof  Justus  a  Roman  was consecrated Bishop by St  Augustine  Here follows a short Description  of the City the Limits of the Diocesse and the four Dea∣neries it consists of The Valuation in the Exchequer Firstfruits and  Peter  Pence That eighty one Bishops more by nine than in  Canterbury  have sate in the Chair of  Rochester  and the present Bishop is Dr  John Bowles  but more particularly of the three first Successors of  Justus  named  Paulinus Gundulphus  and  Gilbertus  who were bu∣ried here tho' no Monuments remain of them Then we come to  Walter de Merton  Bishop of this See who founded  Merton  College in  Oxford  whose Monument here was re∣newed by Sir  Henry Savile  Warden of that College and by the Inscription thereon it appears the said Bishop died After three Bishops more here mention'd our Au∣thor observes That he finds no more of this Diocesse to have been buried in this Cathedral Church because com∣monly they were removed to another See before they were translated to another Life this Preferment being only a Step to a higher Therefore after a Word or two of St  William  the Baker and Martyr here inshrined from  Cap∣grave  and the like of the Priory our Author proceeds to other Churches the rest of the Funeral Monuments in this being of later Times which he reserves for another Vo∣lume At  Ailesford  we have an Account of the Interment of  Catigern  the Brother of King  Vortimer  and  Horsa  the  Saxon  who kill'd each other in a pitch'd Battle In  Otte∣ham  the

magnificently at St  Paul's  Cathedral  London  the th of  February  following And here we have his Epitaph imitated from that com∣posed by  Isaac du Bellay  in memory of the  Sieur de Bonivet  and some Elegies made upon him both in  Latin  and  English  by King  James  In  Tunbridge  we have some Account of the Lord  Staffords  the  Clares  and  Audleys  Earls of  Gloucester  and  Andrew Jud  Founder of the FreeSchool here In  Sevenoke  an Account of the poor Foundling there named  William Sevenoke  who in was Lord Mayor of  Lon∣don  and then built a Hospital and a FreeSchool in the said

the Parson of the Town all the Women therein who desir'd to have Male Children offering him a Cockchicken and all who covet∣ed Females a Hen Likewise of the Worship paid to St  Tho Becket  in this Town and the Miracles he wrought here as the springing a Well out of dry Ground enjoin∣ing no Nightingale to sing thereabout because one had disturbed him in his Prayers which is as true doubtless as that other pious Prohibition of any Smith to thrive in the Parish because one had prick'd his Horse in shoeing Here from the Victories of the  Kentish  Men over the  Danes  in  Holmes Dale  and the many brave Warriors interr'd there our Author takes occasion to conclude this Part with some general Characters of this flourishing County of  Kent  be∣ginning with  Michael Drayton  's Encomium and Mr  Sel∣den  's Notes upon the Place concerning their throwing off the  Norman  Yoke with  John  of  Salisbury  's Testimo∣ny That  Kentish  Men had to his Time the Prerogative of the Vantguard in the Wars More particularly of the Gentry and Yeomanry of  Kent  which with several In∣stances of their Privileges and Prerogatives together with the Courage and Happiness of the Church in up∣holding  her Rights against the Monks and even Arch∣bishops and maintaining her Chair immoveably in this one Place brings us at Page to an End of the Observa∣tions upon this little See of  Rochester  The next is  Ancient Funeral Monuments within the Diocesse of  LON∣DON These are introduced with several Commendations of this famous Metropolis in Verse and Prose by  John Johnston  Sir  Robert Dallington Speed Robert  of  Gloucester Camden Adrian Junius W Warner  and  Robert Fabian  So we enter into St  Paul  's Cathedral founded by King  Ethelbert  and here we have his Charter with the Dona∣tions and Confirmations of his Royal Successors and other Benefactors The present Government Extent and Value of the Bishoprick Whence we proceed to the Monu∣ments beginning with King  Sebba  's so pass to other  Saxon  Princes and several Bishops of  London  who were here in∣terr'd particularly that  William  a  Norman  who was Bishop of this Diocesse at the Conquest and who obtain∣ed of  William  the  Conqueror  a Grant to this City of Li∣berties in as ample a Manner as it enjoy'd them under  Ed∣ward  the  Confessor  Which in our modern  English  runs thus  "  William  King greets  William  Bishop and  God∣frey  Portgrave and all the Borough of  London French  and  English  friendly And I make known to you that ye be worthy to enjoy all That Law and Privilege which ye did in the Days of King  Edward  And I will That every Child be his Father's Heir after his Father's De∣cease And I will not suffer that any Man do unto you any Injury God you keep"  But because the Words of this Grant which was sealed with green Wax were written in the  English  spoken at the Conquest that is the  Saxon  Tongue we have here gratified the Curious with a Transcript of it at the bottom of the Page  Williem

being buried at St  Albans  however upon that fond Conceit some Men would latterly have Meetings here on St  An∣drew  'sDay says  Stow  and conclude on a Breakfast or Dinner as assuming themselves to be Servants or to hold diversity of Offices under the said Duke  Humphrey  Here we have also  Margaret  the second Wife of  John Talbot  the renowned Earl of  Shrewsbury  who died in  June  And

BlackFryars  and the rest of the Parishes giving an Account of their Religious Foundations the Interments and ancient In∣scriptions in them of which we cannot be further expres∣sive than to observe that the most considerable Persons and Antiquities most copiously treated of are in St  John Zacha∣ries  Tho Thorp  Baron of the  Exchequer  who was beheaded by the Rebels in In St  Michael's

ap∣pear below  Dr  Fuller  in his  Worthies of  England has rightly observ'd tho' he gives us no Authority for it That  Chaucer  was living in for in that Year I find he wrote and dated one of his Poems entitled  The Letter of Cupid  However Mr  Brigham  by his Date upon the Monument he erected in honour of this Poet at  Westminster Anno  puts a Period to his Life even two Years before that

with  FIGURES  of those  Trans∣figurations  To which artificial and affected Deformations are added all the  native  and  national Monstrosities  that have appeared to disfigure the  Human Fabrick

and Excellency of the human Fabrick shews the Impiety of varying from Nature and the de∣praved Figures introduced thereby  "insomuch" says the Author "that it may seem the first Men only were made by God but the rest were of Mens Invention And" continues he "while we dispute in Schools whether if it were possible it were lawful for Man to destroy any one Species of God's Creatures tho' but of  Toads  and  Spiders  Because this were a taking away one Link of God's Chain one Note of his Harmony we have taken away the Jewel at that Chain"  He then recommends my Lord  Bacon  's Opinion of the

transforming himself into divers Shapes and of the  Legerdemaine  of  Changelings  We have now gone thro' the Chapters of this Treatise upon which it will be needless here to add any Panegyrick since whoever has read it can't but be acquainted with the Author's Skill and Accuracy in the Philosophy of the hu∣mane Fabrick as well as his Wit and Humour in censuring the depray'd and pragmatical Inventions of Men We will therefore take a View of his APPENDIX  exhibiting the  PEDIGREE  of the  ENGLISH GALLANT which he thought proper to annex having first prosecuted his principal Design to answer the Expectation of the Publick who thought him necessarily engag'd to touch upon the Defor∣mity of Apparel of which almost every Scene afforded emergent Occasion herein explaining the Proverb  God makes but the Taylor shapes  The  English  and the more civiliz'd Nations had hitherto in a great measure escaped his Sentences of  Treason  against  Nature  whereof many others were convicted yet here they must bear to have their affected Vanities laid before them  "It were not impossible" says he "to prove that there was never any Conceit so extravagant that ever forced the Rules of Nature or Fashion so mad which fell into the Imaginations of any of these indicted Nations that may not meet with some publick Fashion of Apparel a∣mong us and seem to be grounded upon the same pre∣tended Reason"  Our SugarLoaf Hats he attributes to the same Conceit as the SugarLoaf Heads of Foreign Na∣tions our square Caps are owing to their square Heads our flat Caps to their flat Heads our  French  Hoods imitate the  Unicornlike Dress  of Hair among the barbarous  In∣dians  He then shews the foreign Extraction of our Masks Painting and BlackPatches our Pendents and auricular Bravery our Peasecodbellied Doublets emulare the  Gor∣dian  and  Muscovite  Fashion and other  Gorbellied  Nations The slashing and pincking our Doublets our CodPiece Fashion and TrunkHose have all their Semblances in  Barbarian  Nations as likewise our indecent Fashion of naked Breasts and Shoulders our vain and foolish Verdin∣gales  or Hoops Our affected long Shoes our broad Shoes which in Queen  Mary  's Time occasion'd a Procla∣mation that no Man should wear his Shoes above six Inch∣ches square at the Toes and our high Shoes have all their Original from abroad The Vanity of disguising our Shapes is also farther exposed by some poetical Quotations from  Alex Barclay  's Translation of the  Ship of Fools  and from an ingenious old Comedy in the Character of  Lupa  He then concludes the Appendix with this apt Recom∣mendation  "That whoever will reduce Cloaths and Gar∣ments to their true End must fit them to the Service and Commodity of the Body whence dependeth their Original Grace and Comeliness which can no way better be done than by cutting them according to the natural Shape and Proportion of the Body as we may probably imagine the SkinGarments were wherewith the Lord  God  who best knew their Shape first cloath∣ed the Nakedness of our  first Parents  "  And he shews that we ought not to allow Fashions for their Rareness and Novelty when Goodness and Profit are not joined to them  We think it not improper to take Notice of a  Catalogue  of the Author's Works subjoin'd to this Treatise which are as follow Works already published  The natural Language of the Hand    The Art of manual Rhetorick    The deaf and dumb Man's Friend    A Dissection of the Muscles of the Af∣fections of the Mind    The Artificial Changeling  Works ac∣complished by him not then published  The national Ex∣pressions of the Hand    The natural Language of the Head or the Notions of Physiognomy    The Art of Cephalical Rhetorick    The moral Anatomy of the Body    The Academy of the Deaf and Dumb teaching them to hear with their Eyes and to learn to speak    Physiognomia Medici    Tractatus de re∣movendis Loquelae Impedimentis    Tractatus de removendis Auditionis Impedimentis  And at the End of this  Catalogue  the Author notes in a short  Latin  Advertisement the great Fatigue of writing and reading many Books and that he must for the fu∣ture wholly employ himself in the Business of his Profession    POSTSCRIPT  THUS has the  British Librarian  given a Specimen of his Undertaking to the Extent of one Volume in a diligent Abstract of above fifty of our Scarce Useful and Valuable Books In the choice of them tho' here are some of considerable Valuation extracted yet the high Price to which many are advanced in the Shops has been no Temptation for his making that the Rule to prefer them He has rather thought those which are most  useful  the most  valuable  and such of them as are grown most  scarce  most needful and deserving of this Recommenda∣tion Accordingly 'tis not doubted but they will appear worthy of it by what is here advanced to the Reader's No∣tice from them being all fraught with much  observable Matter  as may be easily perceived by this Scheme for compassing the readiest Knowledge and Command thereof which may have escaped the Notice or Memory of several who are even possessed of the Books themselves which contain it and also give Intelligence to others of many remarkable  Things Places  and  Persons  which they would never otherwise have known no Work of the like size a∣mong us having pointed out such a variety of those Parti∣culars or drawn into so close a compass the Substance of so much Reading He might perhaps have been more amusing to some Readers in being more ample upon some parts of his Authors by extracting Pages of Controversies or Paragraphs of the pretty Stories surprizing Passages or eloquent Speeches in them but as many  Topicks  in an Author must be sacrificed to gratify a few Indulgences in this kind and to divert some the Enquiries of abundance remain unsatis∣fy'd the Plan has been follow'd which was at first laid down to make it a Work rather of general  Information  than particular  Entertainment  Among the Books conducive to this Purpose those for which Gratitude here demands chiefly the Publication of our Thanks are the  Manuscripts  Such in the first place is that here call'd Sir  Thomas Wriothesly's Collections  contain∣ing  the  Arms  and  Characters  of the  Knights of the Garter  and  Views  of the ancient  Ceremonies  used in  Creating  the  Knights of the Bath  c For that Sketch which the  Li∣brarian  has here given the  Publick  of it they are both be∣holden to the Permission of his Grace the Duke of  Mon∣tagu  the noble Owner of that valuable Volumeand to some Explanations thereof which were also courteously imparted by  John Anstis  Esq  Garter  Principal  King of Arms  whose extensive Knowlege in these Subjects his own elaborate Publications in honour of both those Or∣ders have sufficiently confirm'd Nor will it be thought a Repitition unnecessary by grateful Minds that the  Li∣brarian  here renews his Acknowledgments to  Nathaniel Booth  Esq  of  Gray'sInn  for his repeated Communica∣tions having been favour'd not only with that curious  Mis∣cellany  containing many of the old Earl of  Derby  's Papers which in one of the foregoing Numbers is abridg'd but others out of his choice Collections which may enrich some future Numbers when Opportunity shall permit the Con∣tents thereof to appear Other Manuscripts herein described were partly the Collection of Mr  Charles Grimes  late also of  Gray'sInn  and in the Bookseller's Possession for whom this Work is printed except one ancient Relique of the famous  Wicklife  for the use of which many Thanks are here return'd to Mr  Joseph Ames  Member of the  Society of Antiquaries  The Author of this Work is moreover obliged to the Library of this last worthy Preserver of An∣tiquities as also to that of his ingenious Friend Mr  Peter Thompson  for the use of several  printed Books  which are more scarce than many Manuscripts particularly some set forth by our first Printer in  England  and others which will rise among the Curious in Value as by the Depre∣dations of Accident or Ignorance they decrease in Num∣ber We must take some further Opportunity to express our Obligations to other Gentlemen who have favour'd us with such like Litterary Curiosities and to some hundreds unknown who have shewn a relish for the Usefulness of this Performance by encouraging the Sale of it  There can be added nothing more for the Reader's fur∣ther Convenience to this general Table or  Contents  but an Alphabetical  Index  to it as a MasterKey that will give immediate recourse to those Topicks in so many Volumes thus abstracted which had been lock'd up or secreted from their Knowledge to whom they would have been useful  And as from those  ancient Springs  it is hereby obvious to all Readers what a  new River  of Intelligence is conducted for their Benefit so the Author from the Example of o∣thers in suchlike Attempts may be sure of that Satisfac∣tion which arises from the Contemplation of having been instrumental to so much publick Good Those who know the nature of such Works may think one Volume com∣prehending the principal Matters in such a Library of Books and near one half of them Folios expeditiously publish∣ed within the Space of one Year But as in  Performan∣ces of this kind  the most industrious Part is that which is most invisible and the Fatigue is accounted of from the small Quantity of Writing which appears not the vast and unseen Mass of Reading required therein the Operation is apt to be thought dilatory by those who are unacquainted with the Labour of it And for the same Reason that they convey the Mind to such multifarious Advantages of Infor∣mation their own Merits also are usually disregarded by the Generality who are unexperienc'd in the Execution but enjoy the Advantages of the Work Like those who look down with Admiration at the Cost and Pains which are be∣stowed upon the curious Compartments into which a Piece of Ground is divided and the flow'ry Groups the verdant Mazes or the fragrant Bowers wherewith it is adorn'd yet overlook those artificial Mounts and Terras Walks which they are at that instant upon which give them all that Com∣mand over this Variety of Prospects and are indeed the most expensive and laborious Ornaments in the Garden  All we shall say more of our  Librarian  is If he is pre∣vail'd on to proceed in cultivating this Undertaking with∣out Intermission he will continue his utmost Pains to make it answer all the Accommodations proposed from it Or if thro' other Engagements it should be suffer'd to lie fallow for a Season 'tis in hopes of increasing its Vigour and making the Returns equivalent to the Toils thereof  Gray'sInn  Feb    W O  FINIS  INDEX  ABassines
