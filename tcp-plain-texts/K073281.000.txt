 THE VISION A POEM ON THE DEATH of the QUEEN  Price Sixpence  THE VISION  A POEM ON THE DEATH Of Her Most Gracious MAJESTY Queen CAROLINE  By STEPHEN DUCK  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  and J JACKSON in  St James  's  Street  MDCCXXXVII  THE VISION A POEM  'TWAS on the fatal Day that claims a Sigh  From ev'ry Heart a Tear from ev'ry Eye  Ere  Albion  's Joys were wholly snatch'd away  Or  Britons  for their Queen forbid to pray  While Hope and Fear contended in my Breast  Intruding Sleep my weary Eyes opprest  Wrapt in a Visionwhere I cannot say  Nor can the Muse the glorious Place display  It seem'd some blessed Angel's happy Sphere  Or blessed Angels might inhabit there  For sure the beauteous Scene did far excel  What Heathen Bards of blest  Elysium  tell  A Cloud of Glory shone before my Face  Which shed refulgent Rays around the Place  And scatter'd Colours various to behold  Here blushing Rubies there the burnish'd Gold  As wond'ring at the Scene I gazing stood  Struck with religious Awe that chill'd my Blood  I saw BRITANNIA with dejected Air  Pale was her Face dishevell'd was her Hair  Her trembling Hand had dropt the Laurel Bough  A mournful Cypress wreath'd her pensive Brow  Before the shining Cloud she prostrate lay  And thus she pray'd or seem'd at least to pray  " ALMIGHTY Father whose Commanding Pow'r  Can hasten or adjourn the fatal Hour  Can lengthen or contract a Monarch's Reign  Or raise the silent Dead to Life again  Oh stop thy threat'ning Arm and spare awhile  One sacred  Life  so precious to my Isle  For Royal CAROLINA'S Health I sue  The best of Sov'reigns and of Subjects too  In ev'ry State her Goodness has been prov'd  When rul'd obedient and when ruling lov'd  Securely blest beneath her gentle Sway  'Tis Happiness to serve and Pleasure to obey  NOR fewer Charms adorn her private Life  The tend'rest Mother most submissive Wife  Who never yet her Consort disobey'd  By Honour Duty Love and Virtue sway'd  In Virtue's Path she constantly proceeds  By Virtue's Rule she measures all her Deeds  Ev'n now tho' tortur'd with severest Pains  Her patient Tongue adores Thee not complains  To Thee her ardent Pray'rs and Praises tend  On Thee on Thee alone her Hopes depend  Firm Faith and Patience fortify her Mind  To live indiff'rent or to die resign'd  Yet spare her longer from her heav'nly Throne  Spare her for others Good tho' not her own  Look down and see her duteous Children's Tears  Look down and hear the best of Monarch's Pray'rs  See round her Bed her tender Offspring kneels  While ev'ry Pang her Royal Consort feels  Nor only  They  intreat Thee for her Breath  Three Kingdoms beg Thee to avert her Death  Religion Learning Art and Science fear  To find a Period and a Grave with Her  For Her the Widows weep a briny Tide  For Her whose Bounty has their Loss supply'd  For Her unhappy helpless Orphans mourn  And shed more Tears than o'er their Parents Urn  Their Parents Death they need no longer grieve  Might CAROLINE their better Parent live  Who feeds the Hungry succours the Distrest  And from Oppression rescues the Opprest  Ev'n in the Height of Power her Power was shown  In Acts of Love and Mercy like Thy own  Oh were She like Thee more in ev'ry State  Oh were She were She like Thee free from Fate  But  That  alas is not to Mortals giv'n  Yet surely  This  is in the Grant of Heav'n  Increase her Days restore her native Bloom  Nor crop the Royal Fruit till  Autumn  come  Few are the Years to Mortal Man assign'd  Ah let not Herto fewer be confin'd  But stop thy threat'ning Arm and spare awhile  Her sacred Life so precious to my Isle"  She said The Tears ran trickling as she spoke  While from the radiant Cloud these Accents broke  " BRITANNIA cease thy fruitless Tears and know  One certain Day is fix'd for all below  That Day permit to Heav'n for Heav'n alone  Knows when the noble Work of Virtue's done  Few are the Years you say of human Kind  But Years add nothing to the perfect Mind  Improperly by  Time  you count the Date  'Tis  virtuous Actions  make a Life complete  Suppose the Sun that chears your earthly Clime  Should run his destin'd Course in half the Time  Performing all the Offices of Light  Of Heat of circling Seasons Day and Night  Say Could you think his Race too swiftly run  Or Could you call him an imperfect Sun  Heav'n's greatest Lord that over All presides  Who rules that Sun and all his Motions guides  In Length of Years an Equal ne'er survey'd  But is not  therefore  worshipp'd or obey'd  His  Goodness  only claims that Tribute due  His Goodness not his  Age  tho' ever New  If then your gracious Queen tho' few her Days  Has practis'd ev'ry Virtue worthy Praise  Worthy immortal Bliss What can she more  Tho' Heav'n again her former Health restore  Tho' Heav'n a Thousand added Years bestow  Her Soul can be no perfecter below  'Tis Time She now should quit her mortal Throne  To change an Earthly for a Heav'nly Crown  And see She mounts Triumphant to the Skies  Of all her Virtues reaps the glorious Prize"  STARTING to hear the fatal Sentence spoke  With trembling Joints and streaming Eyes I 'woke  When strait I hear Complaints from ev'ry Tongue  On ev'ry Face a Cloud of Sorrow hung  Sad Sighs and Floods of fruitless Tears bemoan  The Noblest Queen that ever grac'd a Throne  FINIS
