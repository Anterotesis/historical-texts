Of the  PASSIONS  PART I  Of Pride and Humility  SECT I  Division of the Subject  _AS all the perceptions of the mind may be divided into  impressions  and  ideas  so the impressions admit of another division into  original  and  secondary  This division of the impressions is  the same with that which  Book I Part I Sect  I formerly made use of when I distinguish'd them into impressions of  sensation  and  reflection  Original impressions or impressions of sensation are such as without any antecedent perception arise in the soul from the constitution of the body from the animal spirits or from the application of objects to the external organs Secondary or reflective impressions are such as proceed from some of these original ones either immediately or by the interposition of its idea Of the first kind are all the impressions of the senses and all bodily pains and pleasures Of the second are the passions and other emotions resembling them  'TIS certain that the mind in its perceptions must begin somewhere and that since the impressions precede their correspondent ideas there must be some impressions which without any introduction make their appearance in the soul As these depend upon natural and physical causes the examination of them wou'd lead me too far from my present subject into the sciences of anatomy and natural philosophy For this reason I shall here confine myself to those other impressions which I have  call'd secondary and reflective as arising either from the original impressions or from their ideas Bodily pains and pleasures are the source of many passions both when felt and consider'd by the mind but arise originally in the soul or in the body whichever you please to call it without any preceding thought or perception A fit of the gout produces a long train of passions as grief hope fear but is not deriv'd immediately from any affection or idea  THE reflective impressions may be divided into two kinds  viz  the  calm  and the  violent  Of the first kind is the sense of beauty and deformity in action composition and external objects Of the second are the passions of love and hatred grief and joy pride and humility This division is far from being exact The raptures of poetry and music frequently rise to the greatest height while those other impressions properly call'd  passions  may decay into so soft an emotion as to become in a manner imperceptible But as in general the passions are more violent than the emotions arising from beauty and deformity these impressions have been commonly distinguish'd from each other The subject of the human mind being so copious and various  I shall here take advantage of this vulgar and specious division that I may proceed with the greater order and having said all I thought necessary concerning our ideas shall now explain those violent emotions or passions their nature origin causes and effects  WHEN we take a survey of the passions there occurs a division of them into  direct  and  indirect  By direct passions I understand such as arise immediately from good or evil from pain or pleasure By indirect such as proceed from the same principles but by the conjunction of other qualities This distinction I cannot at present justify or explain any farther I can only observe in general that under the indirect passions I comprehend pride humility ambition vanity love hatred envy pity malice generosity with their dependants And under the direct passions desire aversion grief joy hope fear despair and security I shall begin with the former  SECT II  Of pride and humility their objects and causes  THE passions of PRIDE and HUMILITY being simple and uniform impressions 'tis impossible we can ever by a multitude of words give a just definition of them or indeed of any of the passions The utmost we can pretend to is a description of them by an enumeration of such circumstances as attend them But as these words  pride  and  humility  are of general use and the impressions they represent the most common of any every one of himself will be able to form a just idea of them without any danger of mistake For which reason not to lose time upon preliminaries I shall immediately enter upon the examination of these passions  'TIS evident that pride and humility tho' directly contrary have yet the same OBJECT This object is self or that succession of related ideas and impressions of which we have an intimate memory and consciousness Here the view always fixes when  we are actuated by either of these passions According as our idea of ourself is more or less advantageous we feel either of those opposite affections and are elated by pride or dejected with humility Whatever other objects may be comprehended by the mind they are always consider'd with a view to ourselves otherwise they wou'd never be able either to excite these passions or produce the smallest encrease or diminution of them When self enters not into the confideration there is no room either for pride or humility  BUT tho' that connected succession of perceptions which we call  self  be always the object of these two passions 'tis impossible it can be their CAUSE or be sufficient alone to excite them For as these passions are directly contrary and have the same object in common were their object also their cause it cou'd never produce any degree of the one passion but at the same time it must excite an equal degree of the other which opposition and contrariety must destroy both 'Tis impossible a man can at the same time be both proud and humble and where he has different reasons for these passions as frequently happens the passions either take place alternately or if they encounter  the one annihilates the other as far as its strength goes and the remainder only of that which is superior continues to operate upon the mind But in the present case neither of the passions cou'd ever become superior because supposing it to be the view only of ourself which excited them that being perfectly indifferent to either must produce both in the very same proportion or in other words can produce neither To excite any passion and at the same time raise an equal share of its antagonist is immediately to undo what was done and must leave the mind at last perfectly calm and indifferent  WE must therefore make a distinction betwixt the cause and the object of these passions betwixt that idea which excites them and that to which they direct their view when excited Pride and humility being once rais'd immediately turn our attention to ourself and regard that as their ultimate and final object but there is something farther requisite in order to raise them Something which is peculiar to one of the passions and produces not both in the very same degree The first idea that is presented to the mind is that of the cause or productive principle This excites the passion  connected with it and that passion when excited turns our view to another idea which is that of self Here then is a passion plac'd betwixt two ideas of which the one produces it and the other is produc'd by it The first idea therefore represents the  cause  the second the  object  of the passion  TO begin with the causes of pride and humility we may observe that their most obvious and remarkable property is the vast variety of  subjects  on which they may be plac'd Every valuable quality of the mind whether of the imagination judgment memory or disposition wit goodsense learning courage justice integrity all these are the causes of pride and their opposites of humility Nor are these passions confin'd to the mind but extend their view to the body likewise A man may be proud of his beauty strength agility good mein address in dancing riding fencing and of his dexterity in any manual business or manufacture But this is not all The passion looking farther comprehend whatever objects are in the least ally'd or related to us Our country family children relations riches houses gardens horses dogs cloaths any of these may become a cause either of pride or of humility  FROM the consideration of these causes it appears necessary we shou'd make a new distinction in the causes of the passion betwixt that  quality  which operates and the  subject  on which it is plac'd A man for instance is vain of a beautiful house which belongs to him or which he has himself built and contriv'd Here the object of the passion is himself and the cause is the beautiful house Which cause again is subdivided into two parts  viz  the quality which operates upon the passion and the subject in which the quality inheres The quality is the beauty and the subject is the house consider'd as his property or contrivance Both these parts are essential nor is the distinction vain and chimerical Beauty consider'd merely as such unless plac'd upon something related to us never produces any pride or vanity and the strongest relation alone without beauty or something else in its place has as little influence on that passion Since therefore these two particulars are easily separated and there is a necessity for their conjunction in order to produce the passion we ought to consider them as component parts of the cause and infix in our minds an exact idea of this distinction  SECT III  Whence these objects and causes are deriv'd  BEING so far advanc'd as to observe a difference betwixt the  object  of the passions and their  cause  and to distinguish in the cause the  quality  which operates on the passions from the  subject  in which it inheres we now proceed to examine what determines each of them to be what it is and assigns such a particular object and quality and subject to these affections By this means we shall fully understand the origin of pride and humility  'TIS evident in the first place that these passions are determin'd to have self for their  object  not only by a natural but also by an original property No one can doubt but this property is  natural  from the constancy and steadiness of its operations 'Tis always self which is the object of pride and humility and whenever the passions look beyond 'tis still with a view to ourselves nor can any person or object otherwise have any influence upon us  THAT this proceeds from an  original  quality or primary impulse will likewise appear evident if we consider that 'tis the distinguishing characteristic of these passions Unless nature had given some original qualities to the mind it cou'd never have any secondary ones because in that case it wou'd have no foundation for action nor cou'd ever begin to exert itself Now these qualities which we must consider as original are such as are most inseparable from the soul and can be resolv'd into no other And such is the quality which determines the object of pride and humility  WE may perhaps make it a greater question whether the  causes  that produce the passion be as  natural  as the object to which it is directed and whether all that vast variety proceeds from caprice or from the constitution of the mind This doubt we shall soon remove if we cast our eye upon human nature and consider that in all nations and ages the same objects still give rise to pride and humility and that upon the view even of a stranger we can know pretty nearly what will either encrease or diminish his passions of this kind If there be any variation in this particular it proceeds from nothing but a difference in the  tempers and complexions of men and is besides very inconsiderable Can we imagine it possible that while human nature remains the same men will ever become entirely indifferent to their power riches beauty or personal merit and that their pride and vanity will not be affected by these advantages  BUT tho' the causes of pride and humility be plainly  natural  we shall find upon examination that they are not  original  and that 'tis utterly impossible they shou'd each of them be adapted to these passions by a particular provision and primary constitution of nature Beside their prodigious number many of them are the effects of art and arise partly from the industry partly from the caprice and partly from the good fortune of men Industry produces houses furniture cloaths Caprice determines their particular kinds and qualities And good fortune frequently contributes to all this by discovering the effects that result from the different mixtures and combinations of bodies 'Tis absurd therefore to imagine that each of these was foreseen and provided for by nature and that every new production of art which causes pride or humility instead of adapting itself to  the passion by partaking of some general quality that naturally operates on the mind is itself the object of an original principle which till then lay conceal'd in the soul and is only by accident at last brought to light Thus the first mechanic that invented a fine scritoure produc'd pride in him who became possest of it by principles different from those which made him proud of handsome chairs and tables As this appears evidently ridiculous we must conclude that each cause of pride and humility is not adapted to the passions by a distinct original quality but that there are some one or more circumstances common to all of them on which their efficacy depends  BESIDES we find in the course of nature that tho' the effects be many the principles from which they arise are commonly but few and simple and that 'tis the sign of an unskilful naturalist to have recourse to a different quality in order to explain every different operation How much more must this be true with regard to the human mind which being so confin'd a subject may justly be thought incapable of containing such a monstrous heap of principles as wou'd be necessary to excite the passions of pride and humility were each distinct  cause adapted to the passion by a distinct set of principles  HERE therefore moral philosophy is in the same condition as natural with regard to astronomy before the time of  Copernicus  The antients tho' sensible of that maxim  that nature does nothing in vain  contriv'd such intricate systems of the heavens as seem'd inconsistent with true philosophy and gave place at last to something more simple and natural To invent without scruple a new principle to every new phaenomenon instead of adapting it to the old to overload our hypotheses with a variety of this kind are certain proofs that none of these principles is the just one and that we only desire by a number of falsehoods to cover our ignorance of the truth  SECT IV  Of the relations of impressions and ideas  THUS we have establish'd two truths without any obstacle or difficulty  that 'tis from natural principles this variety of causes excite pride and humility  and  that 'tis not by a different principle each different cause is adapted to its passion  We shall now proceed to enquire how we may reduce these principles to a lesser number and find among the causes something common on which their influence depends  IN order to this we must reflect on certain properties of human nature which tho' they have a mighty influence on every operation both of the understanding and passions are not commonly much insisted on by philosophers The  first  of these is the association of ideas which I have so often observ'd and explain'd 'Tis impossible for the mind to fix itself steadily upon one idea for any considerable time nor can it by its utmost efforts ever arrive at such a constancy But however changeable our thoughts may be they are not entirely without rule and method in their changes The rule by which they proceed is to pass from one object to what is resembling contiguous to or produc'd by it When one idea is present to the imagination any other united by these relations naturally follows it and enters with more facility by means of that introduction  THE  second  property I shall observe in the human mind is a like association of impressions  All resembling impressions are connected together and no sooner one arises than the rest immediately follow Grief and disappointment give rise to anger anger to envy envy to malice and malice to grief again till the whole circle be compleated In like manner our temper when elevated with joy naturally throws itself into love generosity pity courage pride and the other resembling affections 'Tis difficult for the mind when actuated by any passion to confine itself to that passion alone without any change or variation Human nature is too inconstant to admit of any such regularity Changeableness is essential to it And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions which are suitable to the temper and agree with that set of passions which then prevail 'Tis evident then there is an attraction or association among impressions as well as among ideas tho' with this remarkable difference that ideas are associated by resemblance contiguity and causation and impressions only by resemblance  IN the  third  place 'tis observable of these two kinds of association that they very much assist and forward each other and that the transition is more easily made where  they both concur in the same object Thus a man who by any injury from another is very much discompos'd and ruffled in his temper is apt to find a hundred subjects of discontent impatience fear and other uneasy passions especially if he can discover these subjects in or near the person who was the cause of his first passion Those principles which forward the transition of ideas here concur with those which operate on the passions and both uniting in one action bestow on the mind a double impulse The new passion therefore must arise with so much greater violence and the transition to it must be render'd so much more easy and natural  UPON this occasion I may cite the authority of an elegant writer who expresses himself in the following manner  As the fancy delights in every thing that is great strange or beautiful and is still more pleas'd the more it finds of these perfections in the  same  object so it is capable of receiving a new satisfaction by the assistance of another sense Thus any continu'd sound as the music of birds or a fall of waters awakens every moment the mind of the beholder and makes him more attentive to the several  beauties of the place that lie before him Thus if there arises a fragrancy of smells or perfumes they heighten the pleasure of the imagination and make even the colours and verdure of the landschape appear more agreeable for the ideas of both senses recommend each other and are pleasanter together than when they enter the mind separately As the different colours of a picture when they are well disposed set off one anotehr and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the situation  In this phaenomenon we may remark the association both of impressions and ideas as well as the mutual assistance they lend each other  SECT V  Of the influence of these relations on pride and humility  THESE principles being establish'd on unquestionable experience I begin to consider how we shall apply them by revolving over all the causes of pride and humility whether these causes be regarded as the qualities that operate or as the subjects on which the qualities are plac'd In  examining these  qualities  I immediately find many of them to concur in producing the sensation of pain and pleasure independent of those affections which I here endeavour to explain Thus the beauty of our person of itself and by its very appearance gives pleasure as well as pride and its deformity pain as well as humility A magnificent feast delights us and a sordid one displeases What I discover to be true in some instances I  suppose  to be so in all and take it for granted at present without any farther proof that every cause of pride by its peculiar qualities produces a separate pleasure and of humility a separate uneasiness  AGAIN in considering the  subjects  to which these qualities adhere I make a new  supposition  which also appears probable from many obvious instances  viz  that these subjects are either parts of ourselves or something nearly related to us Thus the good and bad qualities of our actions and manners constitute virtue and vice and determine our personal character than which nothing operates more strongly on these passions In like manner 'tis the beauty or deformity of our person houses equipage or furniture by which we are render'd either  vain or humble The same qualities when transfer'd to subjects which bear us no relation influence not in the smallest degree either of these affections  HAVING thus in a manner suppos'd two properties of the causes of these affections  viz  that the  qualities  produce a separate pain or pleasure and that the  subjects  on which the qualities are plac'd are related to self I proceed to examine the passions themselves in order to find something in them correspondent to the suppos'd properties of their causes  First  I find that the peculiar object of pride and humility is determin'd by an original and natural instinct and that 'tis absolutely impossible from the primary constitution of the mind that these passions shou'd ever look beyond self or that individual person of whose actions and sentiments each of us is intimately conscious Here at last the view always rests when we are actuated by either of these passions nor can we in that situation of mind ever lose sight of this object For this I pretend not to give any reason but consider such a peculiar direction of the thought as an original quality  THE  second  quality which I discover in these passions and which I likewise consider as  an original quality is their sensations or the peculiar emotions they excite in the soul and which constitute their very being and essence Thus pride is a pleasant sensation and humility a painful and upon the removal of the pleasure and pain there is in reality no pride nor humility Of this our very feeling convinces us and beyond our feeling 'tis here in vain to reason or dispute  IF I compare therefore these two  establish'd  properties of the passions  viz  their object which is self and their sensation which is either pleasant or painful to the two  suppos'd  properties of the causes  viz  their relation to self and their tendency to produce a pain or pleasure independent of the passion I immediately find that taking these suppositions to be just the true system breaks in upon me with an irresistible evidence That cause which excites the passion is related to the object which nature has attributed to the passion the sensation which the cause separately produces is related to the sensation of the passion From this double relation of ideas and impressions the passion is deriv'd The one idea is easily converted into its correlative and the one impression into that which resembles  and corresponds to it With how much greater facility must this transition be made where these movements mutually assist each other and the mind receives a double impulse from the relations both of its impressions and ideas  THAT we may comprehend this the better we must suppose that nature has given to the organs of the human mind a certain disposition fitted to produce a peculiar impression or emotion which we call  pride  To this emotion she has assign'd a certain idea  viz  that of  self  which it never fails to produce This contrivance of nature is easily conceiv'd We have many instances of such a situation of affairs The nerves of the nose and palate are so dispos'd as in certain circumstances to convey such peculiar sensations to the mind The sensations of lust and hunger always produce in us the idea of those peculiar objects which are suitable to each appetite These two circumstances are united in pride The organs are so dispos'd as to produce the passion and the passion after its production naturally produces a certain idea All this needs no proof 'Tis evident we never shou'd be possest of that passion were there not a disposition of mind proper for it and 'tis  as evident that the passion always turns our view to ourselves and makes us think of our own qualities and circumstances  THIS being fully comprehended it may now be ask'd  Whether nature produces the passion immediately of herself or whether she must be assisted by the cooperation of other causes  For 'tis observable that in this particular her conduct is different in the different passions and sensations The palate must be excited by an external object in order to produce any relish But hunger arises internally without the concurrence of any external object But however the case may stand with other passions and impressions 'tis certain that pride requires the assistance of some foreign object and that the organs which produce it exert not themselves like the heart and arteries by an original internal movement For  first  daily experience convinces us that pride requires certain causes to excite it and languishes when unsupported by some excellency in the character in bodily accomplishments in cloaths equipage or fortune  Secondly  'tis evident pride wou'd be perpetual if it arose immediately from nature since the object is always the same and there is no disposition of body peculiar to pride as there  is to thirst and hunger  Thirdly  Humility is in the very same situation with pride and therefore either must upon this supposition be perpetual likewise or must destroy the contrary passion from the very first moment so that none of them cou'd ever make its appearance Upon the whole we may rest satisfy'd with the foregoing conclusion that pride must have a cause as well as an object and that the one has no influence without the other  THE difficulty then is only to discover this cause and find what it is that gives the first motion to pride and sets those organs in action which are naturally fitted to produce that emotion Upon my consulting experience in order to resolve this difficulty I immediately find a hundred different causes that produce pride and upon examining these causes I suppose what at first I perceive to be probable that all of them concur in two circumstances which are that of themselves they produce an impression ally'd to the passion and are plac'd on a subject ally'd to the object of the passion When I consider after this the nature of  relation  and its effects both on the passions and ideas I can no longer doubt upon these suppositions  that 'tis the very principle which gives rise to pride and bestows motion on those organs which being naturally dispos'd to produce that affection require only a first impulse or beginning to their action Any thing that gives a pleasant sensation and is related to self excites the passion of pride which is also agreeable and has self for its object  WHAT I have said of pride is equally true of humility The sensation of humility is uneasy as that of pride is agreeable for which reason the separate sensation arising from the causes must be revers'd while the relation to self continues the same Tho' pride and humility are directly contrary in their effects and in their sensations they have notwithstanding the same object so that 'tis requisite only to change the relation of impressions without making any change upon that of ideas Accordingly we find that a beautiful house belonging to ourselves produces pride and that the same house still belonging to ourselves produces humility when by any accident its beauty is chang'd into deformity and thereby the sensation of pleasure which corresponded to pride is transform'd into pain which is related to humility The double relation between  the ideas and impressions subsists in both cases and produces an easy transition from the one emotion to the other  IN a word nature has bestow'd a kind of attraction on certain impressions and ideas by which one of them upon its appearance naturally introduces its correlative If these two attractions or associations of impressions and ideas concur on the same object they mutually assist each other and the transition of the affections and of the imagination is made with the greatest ease and facility When an idea produces an impression related to an impression which is connected with an idea related to the first idea these two impressions must be in a manner inseparable nor will the one in any case be unattended with the other 'Tis after this manner that the particular causes of pride and humility are determin'd The quality which operates on the passion produces separately an impression resembling it the subject to which the quality adheres is related to self the object of the passion No wonder the whole cause consisting of a quality and of a subject does so unavoidably give rise to the passion  TO illustrate this hypothesis we may compare it to that by which I have already explain'd  the belief attending the judgments which we form from causation I have observ'd that in all judgments of this kind there is always a present impression and a related idea and that the present impression gives a vivacity to the fancy and the relation conveys this vivacity by an easy transition to the related idea Without the present impression the attention is not fix'd nor the spirits excited Without the relation this attention rests on its first object and has no farther consequence There is evidently a great analogy betwixt that hypothesis and our present one of an impression and idea that transfuse themselves into another impression and idea by means of their double relation Which analogy must be allow'd to be no despicable proof of both hypotheses  SECT VI  Limitations of this system  BUT before we proceed farther in this subject and examine particularly all the causes of pride and humility 'twill be proper to make some limitations to the general system  that all agreeable objects related to ourselves by an association of ideas  and of impressions produce pride and disagreeable ones humility  And these limitations are deriv'd from the very nature of the subject  I SUPPOSE an agreeable object to acquire a relation to self the first passion that appears on this occasion is joy and this passion discovers itself upon a slighter relation than pride and vainglory We may feel joy upon being present at a feast where our senses are regal'd with delicacies of every kind But 'tis only the master of the feast who beside the same joy has the additional passion of selfapplause and vanity 'Tis true men sometimes boast of a great entertainment at which they have only been present and by so small a relation convert their pleasure into pride But however this must in general be own'd that joy arises from a more inconsiderable relation than vanity and that many things which are too foreign to produce pride are yet able to give us a delight and pleasure The reason of the difference may be explain'd thus A relation is requisite to joy in order to approach the object to us and make it give us any satisfaction But beside this which is common to both passions 'tis requisite to pride in order to produce a transition  from one passion to another and convert the satisfaction into vanity As it has a double task to perform it must be endow'd with double force and energy To which we may add that where agreeable objects bear not a very close relation to ourselves they commonly do to some other person and this latter relation not only excels but even diminishes and sometimes destroys the former as we shall see afterwards  Part II Sect    HERE then is the first limitation we must make to our general position  that every thing related to us which produces pleasure or pain produces likewise pride or humility  There is not only a relation requir'd but a close one and a closer than is requir'd to joy  II THE second limitation is that the agreeable or disagreeable object be not only closely related but also peculiar to ourselves or at least common to us with a few persons 'Tis a quality observable in human nature and which we shall endeavour to explain afterwards that every thing which is often presented and to which we have been long accustom'd loses its value in our eyes and is in a little time despis'd and neglected We likewise judge of objects more from  comparison than from their real and intrinsic merit and where we cannot by some contrast enhance their value we are apt to overlook even what is essentially good in them These qualities of the mind have an effect upon joy as well as pride and 'tis remarkable that goods which are common to all mankind and have become familiar to us by custom give us little satisfaction tho' perhaps of a more excellent kind than those on which for their singularity we set a much higher value But tho' this circumstance operates on both these passions it has a much greater influence on vanity We are rejoic'd for many goods which on account of their frequency give us on pride Health when it returns after a long absence affords us a very sensible satisfaction but is seldom regarded as a subject of vanity because 'tis shar'd with such vast numbers  THE reason why pride is so much more delicate in this particular than joy I take to be as follows In order to excite pride there are always two objects we must contemplate  viz  the  cause  or that object which produces pleasure and self which is the real object of the passion But joy has only one object necessary to its production  viz  that which gives pleasure and tho' it be requisite  that this bear some relation to self yet that is only requisite in order to render it agreeable nor is self properly speaking the object of this passion Since therefore pride has in a manner two objects to which it directs our view it follows that where neither of them have any singularity the passion must be more weaken'd upon that account than a passion which has only one object Upon comparing ourselves with others as we are every moment apt to do we find we are not in the least distinguish'd and upon comparing the object we possess we discover still the same unlucky circumstance By two comparisons so disadvantageous the passion must be entirely destroy'd  III THE third limitation is that the pleasant or painful object be very discernible and obvious and that not only to ourselves but to others also This circumstance like the two foregoing has an effect upon joy as well as pride We fancy ourselves more happy as well as more virtuous or beautiful when we appear so to others but are still more ostentacious of our virtues than of our pleasures This proceeds from causes which I shall endeavour to explain afterwards  IV THE fourth limitation is deriv'd from the inconstancy of the cause of these passions and from the short duration of its connexion with ourselves What is casual and inconstant gives but little joy and less pride We are not much satisfy'd with the thing itself and are still less apt to feel any new degrees of selfsatisfaction upon its account We foresee and anticipate its change by the imagination which makes us little satisfy'd with the thing We compare it to ourselves whose existence is more durable by which means its inconstancy appears still greater It seems ridiculous to infer an excellency in ourselves from an object which is of so much shorter duration and attends us during so small a part of our existence 'Twill be easy to comprehend the reason why this cause operates not with the same force in joy as in pride since the idea of self is not so essential to the former passion as to the latter  V I MAY add as a fifth limitation or rather enlargement of this system that  general rules  have a great influence upon pride and humility as well as on all the other passions Hence we form a notion of different ranks of men suitable to the power or riches they are possest of and this notion  we change not upon account of any peculiarities of the health or temper of the persons which may deprive them of all enjoyment in their possessions This may be accounted for from the same principles that explain'd the influence of general rules on the understanding Custom readily carries us beyond the just bounds in our passions as well as in our reasonings  IT may not be amiss to observe on this occasion that the influence of general rules and maxims on the passions very much contributes to facilitate the effects of all the principles which we shall explain in the progress of this treatise For 'tis evident that if a person fullgrown and of the same nature with ourselves were on a sudden transported into our world he wou'd be very much embarrass'd with every object and wou'd not readily find what degree of love or hatred pride or humility or any other passion he ought to attribute to it The passions are often vary'd by very inconsiderable principles and these do not always play with a perfect regularity especially on the first trial But as custom and practice have brought to light all these principles and have settled the just value of every thing this must certainly contribute to the easy production of the passions  and guide us by means of general establish'd maxims in the proportions we ought to observe in preferring one object to another This remark may perhaps serve to obviate difficulties that may arise concerning some causes which I shall hereafter ascribe to particular passions and which may be esteem'd too refin'd to operate so universally and certainly as they are found to do  I SHALL close this subject with a reflection deriv'd from these five limitations This reflection is that the persons who are proudest and who in the eye of the world have most reason for their pride are not always the happiest nor the most humble always the most miserable as may at first sight be imagin'd from this system An evil may be real tho' its cause has no relation to us It may be real without being peculiar It may be real without shewing itself to others It may be real without being constant And it may be real without falling under the general rules Such evils as these will not fail to render us miserable tho' they have little tendency to diminish pride And perhaps the most real and the most solid evils of life will be found of this nature  SECT VII  Of vice and virtue  TAKING these limitations along with us let us proceed to examine the causes of pride and humility and see whether in every case we can discover the double relations by which they operate on the passions If we find that all these causes are related to self and produce a pleasure or uneasiness separate from the passion there will remain no farther scruple with regard to the present system We shall principally endeavour to prove the latter point the former being in a manner selfevident  TO begin with VICE and VIRTUE which are the most obvious causes of these passions 'twou'd be entirely foreign to my present purpose to enter upon the controversy which of late years has so much excited the curiosity of the publick  whether these moral distinctions be founded on natural and original principles or arise from interest and education  The examination of this I reserve for the following book and in the mean time shall endeavour to show that my system maintains its ground upon  either of these hypotheses which will be a strong proof of its solidity  FOR granting that morality had no foundation in nature it must still be allow'd that vice and virtue either from selfinterest or the prejudices of education produce in us a real pain and pleasure and this we may observe to be strenuously asserted by the defenders of that hypothesis Every passion habit or turn of character say they which has a tendency to our advantage or prejudice gives a delight or uneasiness and 'tis from thence the approbation or disapprobation arises We easily gain from the liberality of others but are always in danger of losing by their avarice Courage defends us but cowardice lays us open to every attack Justice is the support of society but injustice unless check'd wou'd quickly prove its ruin Humility exalts but pride mortifies us For these reasons the former qualities are esteem'd virtues and the latter regarded as vices Now since 'tis granted there is a delight or uneasiness still attending merit or demerit of every kind this is all that is requisite for my purpose  BUT I go farther and observe that this moral hypothesis and my present system not only agree together but also that allowing  the former to be just 'tis an absolute and invincible proof of the latter For if all morality be founded on the pain or pleasure which arises from the prospect of any loss or advantage that may result from our own characters or from those of others all the effects of morality must be deriv'd from the same pain or pleasure and among the rest the passions of pride and humility The very essence of virtue according to this hypothesis is to produce pleasure and that of vice to give pain The virtue and vice must be part of our character in order to excite pride or humility What farther proof can we desire for the double relation of impressions and ideas  THE same unquestionable argument may be deriv'd from the opinion of those who maintain that morality is something real essential and founded on nature The most probable hypothesis which has been advanc'd to explain the distinction betwixt vice and virtue and the origin of moral rights and obligations is that from a primary constitution of nature certain characters and passions by the very view and contemplation produce a pain and others in like manner excite a pleasure The uneasiness and satisfaction are not only inseparable  from vice and virtue but constitute their very nature and essence To approve of a character is to feel an original delight upon its appearance To disapprove of it is to be sensible of an uneasiness The pain and pleasure therefore being the primary causes of vice and virtue must also be the causes of all their effects and consequently of pride and humility which are the unavoidable attendants of that distinction  BUT supposing this hypothesis of moral philosophy shou'd be allow'd to be false 'tis still evident that pain and pleasure if not the causes of vice and virtue are at least inseparable from them A generous and noble character affords a satisfaction even in the survey and when presented to us tho' only in a poem or fable never fails to charm and delight us On the other hand cruelty and treachery displease from their very nature nor is it possible ever to reconcile us to these qualities either in ourselves or others Thus one hypothesis of morality is an undeniable proof of the foregoing system and the other at worst agrees with it  BUT pride and humility arise not from these qualities alone of the mind which according to the vulgar systems of ethicks  have been comprehended as parts of moral duty but from any other that has a connexion with pleasure and uneasiness Nothing flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleasing by our wit good humour or any other accomplishment and nothing gives us a more sensible mortification than a disappointment in any attempt of that nature No one has ever been able to tell what  wit  is and to shew why such a system of thought must be receiv'd under that denomination and such another rejected 'Tis only by taste we can decide concerning it nor are we possest of any other standard upon which we can form a judgment of this kind Now what is this  taste  from which true and false wit in a manner receive their being and without which no thought can have a title to either of these denominations 'Tis plainly nothing but a sensation of pleasure from true wit and of uneasiness from false without our being able to tell the reasons of that pleasure or uneasiness The power of bestowing these opposite sensations is therefore the very essence of true and false wit and consequently the cause of that pride or humility which arises from them  THERE may perhaps be some who being accustom'd to the style of the schools  and pulpit and having never consider'd human nature in any other light than that in which  they  place it may here be surpriz'd to hear me talk of virtue as exciting pride which they look upon as a vice and of vice as producing humility which they have been taught to consider as a virtue But not to dispute about words I observe that by  pride  I understand that agreeable impression which arises in the mind when the view either of our virtue beauty riches or power makes us satisfy'd with ourselves And that by  humility  I mean the opposite impression 'Tis evident the former impression is not always vicious nor the latter virtuous The most rigid morality allows us to receive a pleasure from reflecting on a generous action and 'tis by none esteem'd a virtue to feel any fruitless remorses upon the thoughts of past villiany and baseness Let us therefore examine these impressions consider'd in themselves and enquire into their causes whether plac'd on the mind or body without troubling ourselves at present with that merit or blame which may attend them  SECT VIII  Of beauty and deformity  WHETHER we consider the body as a part of ourselves or assent to those philosophers who regard it as something external it must still be allow'd to be near enough connected with us to form one of these double relations which I have asserted to be necessary to the causes of pride and humility Wherever therefore we can find the other relation of impressions to join to this of ideas we may expect with assurance either of these passions according as the impression is pleasant or uneasy But  beauty  of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight and satisfaction as  deformity  produces pain upon whatever subject it may be plac'd and whether survey'd in an animate or inanimate object If the beauty or deformity therefore be plac'd upon our own bodies this pleasure or uneasiness must be converted into pride or humility as having in this case all the circumstances requisite to produce a perfect transition of impressions and ideas These opposite sensations are related to the opposite passions The beauty  or deformity is closely related to self the object of both these passions No wonder then our own beauty becomes an object of pride and deformity of humility  BUT this effect of personal and bodily qualities is not only a proof of the present system by shewing that the passions arise not in this case without all the circumstances I have requir'd but may be employ'd as a stronger and more convincing argument If we consider all the hypotheses which have been form'd either by philosophy or common reason to explain the difference betwixt beauty and deformity we shall find that all of them resolve into this that beauty is such an order and construction of parts as either by the  primary constitution  of our nature by  custom  or by  caprice  is fitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul This is the distinguishing character of beauty and forms all the difference betwixt it and deformity whose natural tendency is to produce uneasiness Pleasure and pain therefore are not only necessary attendants of beauty and deformity but constitute their very essence And indeed if we consider that a great part of the beauty which we admire either in animals or in other objects is deriv'd from the  idea of convenience and utility we shall make no scruple to assent to this opinion That shape which produces strength is beautiful in one animal and that which is a sign of agility in another The order and convenience of a palace are no less essential to its beauty than its mere figure and appearance In like manner the rules of architecture require that the top of a pillar shou'd be more slender than its base and that because such a figure conveys to us the idea of security which is pleasant whereas the contrary form gives us the apprehension of danger which is uneasy From innumerable instances of this kind as well as from considering that beauty like wit cannot be defin'd but is discern'd only by a taste or sensation we may conclude that beauty is nothing but a form which produces pleasure as deformity is a structure of parts which conveys pain and since the power of producing pain and pleasure make in this manner the essence of beauty and deformity all the effects of these qualities must be deriv'd from the sensation and among the rest pride and humility which of all their effects are the most common and remarkable  THIS argument I esteem just and decisive but in order to give greater authority to the present reasoning let us suppose it false for a moment and see what will follow 'Tis certain then that if the power of producing pleasure and pain forms not the essence of beauty and deformity the sensations are at least inseparable from the qualities and 'tis even difficult to consider them apart Now there is nothing common to natural and moral beauty both of which are the causes of pride but this power of producing pleasure and as a common effect supposes always a common cause 'tis plain the pleasure must in both cases be the real and influencing cause of the passion Again there is nothing originally different betwixt the beauty of our bodies and the beauty of external and foreign objects but that the one has a near relation to ourselves which is wanting in the other This original difference therefore must be the cause of all their other differences and among the rest of their different influence upon the passion of pride which is excited by the beauty of our person but is not affected in the least by that of foreign and external objects Placing then these two conclusions together we find they compose the preceding system betwixt  them  viz  that pleasure as a related or resembling impression when plac'd on a related object by a natural transition produces pride and its contrary humility This system then seems already sufficiently confirm'd by experience tho' we have not yet exhausted all our arguments  'TIS not the beauty of the body alone that produces pride but also its strength and force Strength is a kind of power and therefore the desire to excel in strength is to be consider'd as an inferior species of  ambition  For this reason the present phaenomenon will be sufficiently accounted for in explaining that passion  CONCERNING all other bodily accomplishments we may observe in general that whatever in ourselves is either useful beautiful or surprising is an object of pride and it's contrary of humility Now 'tis obvious that every thing useful beautiful or surprising agrees in producing a separate pleasure and agrees in nothing else The pleasure therefore with the relation to self must be the cause of the passion  THO' it shou'd be question'd whether beauty be not something real and different from the power of producing pleasure it can never be disputed that as surprize is nothing  but a pleasure arising from novelty it is not properly speaking a quality in any object but merely a passion or impression in the soul It must therefore be from that impression that pride by a natural transition arises And it arises so naturally that there is nothing  in us or belonging to us  which produces surprize that does not at the same time excite that other passion Thus we are vain of the surprising adventures we have met with the escapes we have made and dangers we have been expos'd to Hence the origin of vulgar lying where men without any interest and merely out of vanity heap up a number of extraordinary events which are either the fictions of their brain or if true have at least no connexion with themselves Their fruitful invention supplies them with a variety of adventures and and where that talent is wanting they appropriate such as belong to others in order to satisfy their vanity  IN this phaenomenon are contain'd two curious experiments which if we compare them together according to the known rules by which we judge of cause and effect in anatomy natural philosophy and other sciences will be an undeniable argument for that influence of the double relations abovemention'd  By one of these experiments we find that an object produces pride merely by the interposition of pleasure and that because the quality by which it produces pride is in reality nothing but the power of producing pleasure By the other experiment we find that the pleasure produces the pride by a transition along related ideas because when we cut off that relation the passion is immediately destroy'd A surprising adventure in which we have been ourselves engag'd is related to us and by that means produces pride But the adventures of others tho' they may cause pleasure yet for want of this relation of ideas never excite that passion What farther proof can be desired for the present system  THERE is only one objection to this system with regard to our body which is that tho' nothing be more agreeable than health and more painful than sickness yet commonly men are neither proud of the one nor mortify'd with the other This will easily be accounted for if we consider the  second  and  fourth  limitations propos'd to our general system It was observ'd that no object ever produces pride or humility if it has not something  peculiar  to ourself as also that every cause of that passion must be in some measure  constant  and hold some proportion to the duration of ourself which is its object Now as health and sickness vary incessantly to all men and there is none who is  solely  or  certainly  fix'd in either these accidental blessings and calamities are in a manner separated from us and are never consider'd as connected with our being and existence And that this account is just appears hence that wherever a malady of any kind is so rooted in our constitution that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery from that moment it becomes an object of humility as is evident in old men whom nothing mortifies more than the consideration of their age and infirmities They endeavour as long as possible to conceal their blindness and deafness their rheums and gouts nor do they ever confess them without reluctance and uneasiness And tho' young men are not asham'd of every headach or cold they fall into yet no topic is so proper to mortify human pride and make us entertain a mean opinion of our nature than this that we are every moment of our lives subject to  such infirmities This sufficiently proves that bodily pain and sickness are in themselves proper causes of humility tho' the custom of estimating every thing by comparison more than by its intrinsic worth and value makes us overlook these calamities which we find to be incident to every one and causes us to form an idea of our merit and character independent of them  WE are asham'd of such maladies as affect others and are either dangerous or disagreeable to them Of the epilepsy because it gives a horror to every one present Of the itch because it is infectious Of the king'sevil because it commonly goes to posterity Men always consider the sentiments of others in their judgment of themselves This has evidently appear'd in some of the foregoing reasonings and will appear still more evidently and be more fully explain'd afterwards  SECT IX  Of external advantages and disadvantages  BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body that is  self  for their natural and more immediate causes we find by experience that there are many other objects which produce these affections and that the primary one is in some measure obscur'd and lost by the multiplicity of foreign and extrinsic We found a vanity upon houses gardens equipages as well as upon personal merit and accomplishments and tho' these external advantages be in themselves widely distant from thought or a person yet they considerably influence even a passion which is directed to that as its ultimate object This happens when external objects acquire any particular relation to ourselves and are associated or connected with us A beautiful fish in the ocean an animal in a desart and indeed any thing that neither belongs nor is related to us has no manner of influence on our vanity whatever extraordinary qualities  it may be endow'd with and whatever degree of surprize and admiration it may naturally occasion It must be some way associated with us in order to touch our pride Its idea must hang in a manner upon that of ourselves and the transition from the one to the other must be easy and natural  BUT here 'tis remarkable that tho' the relation of  resemblance  operates upon the mind in the same manner as contiguity and causation in conveying us from one idea to another yet 'tis seldom a foundation either of pride or of humility If we resemble a person in any of the valuable parts of his character we must in some degree possess the quality in which we resemble him and this quality we always chuse to survey directly in ourselves rather than by reflexion in another person when we wou'd found upon it any degree of vanity So that tho' a likeness may occasionally produce that passion by suggesting a more advantageous idea of ourselves 'tis there the view fixes at last and the passion finds its ultimate and final cause  THERE are instances indeed wherein men shew a vanity in resembling a great man in his countenance shape air or other  minute circumstances that contribute not in any degree to his reputation but it must be confess'd that this extends not very far nor is of any considerable moment in these affections For this I assign the following reason We can never have a vanity of resembling in trifles any person unless he be possess'd of very shining qualities which give us a respect and veneration for him These qualities then are properly speaking the causes of our vanity by means of their relation to ourselves Now after what manner are they related to ourselves They are parts of the person we value and consequently connected with these trifles which are also suppos'd to be parts of him These trifles are connected with the resembling qualities in us and these qualities in us being parts are connected with the whole and by that means form a chain of several links betwixt ourselves and the shining qualities of the person we resemble But besides that this multitude of relations must weaken the connexion 'tis evident the mind in passing from the shining qualities to the trivial ones must by that contrast the better perceive the minuteness of the latter and be in some measure asham'd of the comparison and resemblance  THE relation therefore of contiguity or that of causation betwixt the cause and object of pride and humility is alone requisite to give rise to these passions and these relations are nothing else but qualities by which the imagination is convey'd from one idea to another Now let us consider what effect these can possibly have upon the mind and by what means they become so requisite to the production of the passions 'Tis evident that the association of ideas operates in so silent and imperceptible a manner that we are scarce sensible of it and discover it more by its effects than by any immediate feeling or perception It produces no emotion and gives rise to no new impression of any kind but only modifies those ideas of which the mind was formerly possess'd and which it cou'd recal upon occasion From this reasoning as well as from undoubted experience we may conclude that an association of ideas however necessary is not alone sufficient to give rise to any passion  'TIS evident then that when the mind feels the passion either of pride or humility upon the appearance of a related object there is beside the relation or transition of thought an emotion or original impression produc'd  by some other principle The question is whether the emotion first produc'd be the passion itself or some other impression related to it This question we cannot be long in deciding For besides all the other arguments with which this subject abounds it must evidently appear that the relation of ideas which experience shews to be so requisite a circumstance to the production of the passion wou'd be entirely superfluous were it not to second a relation of affections and facilitate the transition from one impression to another If nature produc'd immediately the passion of pride or humility it wou'd be compleated in itself and wou'd require no farther addition or encrease from any other affection But supposing the first emotion to be only related to pride or humility 'tis easily conceiv'd to what purpose the relation of objects may serve and how the two different associations of impressions and ideas by uniting their forces may assist each other's operation This is not only easily conceiv'd but I will venture to affirm 'tis the only manner in which we can conceive this subject An easy transition of ideas which of itself causes no emotion can never be necessary or even useful to the passions but by forwarding  the transition betwixt some related impressions Not to mention that the same object causes a greater or smaller degree of pride not only in proportion to the encrease or decrease of its qualities but also to the distance or nearness of the relalation which is a clear argument for the transition of affections along the relation of ideas since every change in the relation produces a proportionable change in the passion Thus one part of the preceding system concerning the relations of ideas is a sufficient proof of the other concerning that of impressions and is itself so evidently founded on experience that 'twou'd be lost time to endeavour farther to prove it  THIS will appear still more evidently in particular instances Men are vain of the beauty of their country of their county of their parish Here the idea of beauty plainly produces a pleasure This pleasure is related to pride The object or cause of this pleasure is by the supposition related to self or the object of pride By this double relation of impressions and ideas a transition is made from the one impression to the other  MEN are also vain of the temperature of the climate in which they were born of  the fertility of their native soil of the goodness of the wines fruits or victuals produc'd by it of the softness or force of their language with other particulars of that kind These objects have plainly a reference to the pleasures of the senses and are originally consider'd as agreeable to the feeling taste or hearing How is it possible they cou'd ever become objects of pride except by means of that transition aboveexplain'd  THERE are some that discover a vanity of an opposite kind and affect to depreciate their own country in comparison of those to which they have travell'd These persons find when they are at home and surrounded with their countrymen that the strong relation betwixt them and their own nation is shar'd with so many that 'tis in a manner lost to them whereas their distant relation to a foreign country which is form'd by their having seen it and liv'd in it is augmented by their considering how few there are who have done the same For this reason they always admire the beauty utility and rarity of what is abroad above what is at home  SINCE we can be vain of a country climate or any inanimate object which bears a relation to us 'tis no wonder we are vain  of the qualities of those who are connected with us by blood or friendship Accordingly we find that the very same qualities which in ourselves produce pride produce also in a lesser degree the same affection when discover'd in persons related to us The beauty address merit credit and honours of their kindred are carefully display'd by the proud as some of their most considerable sources of their vanity  AS we are proud of riches in ourselves so to satisfy our vanity we desire that every one who has any connexion with us shou'd likewise be possest of them and are asham'd of any one that is mean or poor among our friends and relations For this reason we remove the poor as far from us as possible and as we cannot prevent poverty in some distant collaterals and our forefathers are taken to be our nearest relations upon this account every one affects to be of a good family and to be descended from a long succession of rich and honourable ancestors  I HAVE frequently observ'd that those who boast of the antiquity of their families are glad when they can join this circumstance that their ancestors for many generations have been uninterrupted proprietors  of the same portion of land and that their family has never chang'd its possessions or been transplanted into any other county or province I have also observ'd that 'tis an additional subject of vanity when they can boast that these possessions have been transmitted thro' a descent compos'd entirely of males and that the honours and fortune have never past thro' any female Let us endeavour to explain these phaenomena by the foregoing system  'TIS evident that when any one boasts of the antiquity of his family the subjects of his vanity are not merely the extent of time and number of ancestors but also their riches and credit which are suppos'd to reflect a lustre on himself on account of his relation to them He first considers these objects is affected by them in an agreeable manner and then returning back to himself thro' the relation of parent and child is elevated with the passion of pride by means of the double relation of impressions and ideas Since therefore the passion depends on these relations whatever strengthens any of the relations must also encrease the passion and whatever weakens the relations must diminish the passion Now 'tis certain the identity of the possession strengthens  the relation of ideas arising from blood and kindred and conveys the fancy with greater facility from one generation to another from the remotest ancestors to their posterity who are both their heirs and their descendants By this facility the impression is transmitted more entire and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity  THE case is the same with the transmission of the honours and fortune thro' a succession of males without their passing thro' any female 'Tis a quality of human nature which we shall consider  Part II Sect  afterwards that the imagination naturally turns to whatever is important and considerable and where two objects are presented to it a small and a great one usually leaves the former and dwells entirely upon the latter As in the society of marriage the male sex has the advantage above the female the husband first engages our attention and whether we consider him directly or reach him by passing thro' related objects the thought both rests upon him with greater satisfaction and arrives at him with greater facility than his consort 'Tis easy to see that this property must strengthen the child's relation to the father and weaken that to  the mother For as all relations are nothing but a propensity to pass from one idea to another whatever strengthens the propensity strengthens the relation and as we have a stronger propensity to pass from the idea of the children to that of the father than from the same idea to that of the mother we ought to regard the former relation as the closer and more considerable This is the reason why children commonly bear their father's name and are esteem'd to be of nobler or baser birth according to  his  family And tho' the mother shou'd be possest of a superior spirit and genius to the father as often happens the  general rule  prevails notwithstanding the exception according to the doctrine aboveexplain'd Nay even when a superiority of any kind is so great or when any other reasons have such an effect as to make the children rather represent the mother's family than the father's the general rule still retains such an efficacy that it weakens the relation and makes a kind of break in the line of ancestors The imagination runs not along them with facility nor is able to transfer the honour and credit of the ancestors to their posterity of the same name and family so readily as when the transition is conformable to the general  rules and passes from father to son or from brother to brother  SECT X  Of property and riches  BUT the relation which is esteem'd the closest and which of all others produces most commonly the passion of pride is that of  property  This relation 'twill be impossible for me fully to explain before I come to treat of justice and the other moral virtues 'Tis sufficient to observe on this occasion that property may be defin'd  such a relation betwixt a person and an object as permits him but forbids any other the free use and possession of it without violating the laws of justice and moral equity  If justice therefore be a virtue which has a natural and original influence on the human mind property may be look'd upon as a particular species of  causation  whether we consider the liberty it gives the proprietor to operate as he please upon the object or the advantages which he reaps from it 'Tis the same case if justice according to the system of certain philosophers shou'd be esteem'd an  artificial and not a natural virtue For then honour and custom and civil laws supply the place of natural conscience and produce in some degree the same effects This in the mean time is certain that the mention of the property naturally carries our thought to the proprietor and of the proprietor to the property which being a proof of a perfect relation of ideas is all that is requisite to our present purpose A relation of ideas join'd to that of impressions always produces a transition of affections and therefore whenever any pleasure or pain arises from an object connected with us by property we may be certain that either pride or humility must arise from this conjunction of relations if the foregoing system be solid and satisfactory And whether it be so or not we may soon satisfy ourselves by the most cursory view of human life  EVERY thing belonging to a vain man is the best that is any where to be found His houses equipage furniture cloaths horses hounds excel all others in his conceit and 'tis easy to observe that from the least advantage in any of these he draws a new subject of pride and vanity His wine if you'll believe him has a finer flavour than any other his cookery is more exquisite  his table more orderly his servants more expert the air in which he lives more healthful the soil he cultivates more fertile his fruits ripen earlier and to greater perfection Such a thing is remarkable for its novelty such another for its antiquity This is the workmanship of a famous artist that belong'd once to such a prince or great man All objects in a word that are useful beautiful ot surprizing or are related to such may by means of property give rise to this passion These agree in giving pleasure and agree in nothing else This alone is common to them and therefore must be the quality that produces the passion which is their common effect As every new instance is a new argument and as the instances are here without number I may venture to affirm that scarce any system was ever so fully prov'd by experience as that which I have here advanc'd  IF the property of any thing that gives pleasure either by its utility beauty or novelty produces also pride by a double relation of impressions and ideas we need not be surpriz'd that the power of acquiring this property shou'd have the same effect Now riches are to be consider'd as the power of acquiring the property of what pleases  and 'tis only in this view they have any influence on the passions Paper will on many occasions be consider'd as riches and that because it may convey the power of acquiring money And money is not riches as it is a metal endow'd with certain qualities of solidity weight and fusibility but only as it has a relation to the pleasures and conveniences of life Taking then this for granted which is in itself so evident we may draw from it one of the strongest arguments I have yet employ'd to prove the influence of the double relations on pride and humility  IT has been observ'd in treating of the understanding that the distinction which we sometimes make betwixt a  power  and the  exercise  of it is entirely frivolous and that neither man nor any other being ought ever to be thought possest of any ability unless it be exerted and put in action But tho' this be strictly true in a just and  philosophical  way of thinking 'tis certain it is not  the philosophy  of our passions but that many things operate upon them by means of the idea and supposition of power independent of its actual exercise We are pleas'd when we acquire an ability of procuring pleasure and are displeas'd when another acquires a  power of giving pain This is evident from experience but in order to give a just explication of the matter and account for this satisfaction and uneasiness we must weigh the following reflections  'TIS evident the error of distinguishing power from its exercise proceeds not entirely from the scholastic doctrine of  freewill  which indeed enters very little into common life and has but small influence on our vulgar and popular ways of thinking According to that doctrine motives deprive us not of freewill nor take away our power of performing or forbearing any action But according to common notions a man has no power where very considerable motives lie betwixt him and the satisfaction of his desires and determine him to forbear what he wishes to perform I do not think I have fallen into my enemies power when I see him pass me in the streets with a sword by his side while I am unprovided of any weapon I know that the fear of the civil magistrate is as strong a restraint as any of iron and that I am in as perfect safety as if he were chain'd or imprison'd But when a person acquires such an authority over me that not only there is no external obstacle to his actions but also that  he may punish or reward me as he pleases without any dread of punishment in his turn I then attribute a full power to him and consider myself as his subject or vassal  NOW if we compare these two cases that of a person who has very strong motives of interest or safety to forbear any action and that of another who lies under no such obligation we shall find according to the philosophy explain'd in the foregoing book that the only  known  difference betwixt them lies in this that in the former case we conclude from  past experience  that the person never will perform that action and in the latter that he possibly or probably will perform it Nothing is more fluctuating and inconstant on many occasions than the will of man nor is there any thing but strong motives which can give us an absolute certainty in pronouncing concerning any of his future actions When we see a person free from these motives we suppose a possibility either of his acting or forbearing and tho' in general we may conclude him to be determin'd by motives and causes yet this removes not the uncertainty of our judgment concerning these causes nor the influence of that uncertainty on the passions Since therefore  we ascribe a power of performing an action to every one who has no very powerful motive to forbear it and refuse it to such as have it may justly be concluded that  power  has always a reference to its  exercise  either actual or probable and that we consider a person as endow'd with any ability when we find from past experience that 'tis probable or at least possible he may exert it And indeed as our passions always regard the real existence of objects and we always judge of this reality from past instances nothing can be more likely of itself without any farther reasoning than that power consists in the possibility or probability of any action as discover'd by experience and the practice of the world  NOW 'tis evident that wherever a person is in such a situation with regard to me that there is no very powerful motive to deter him from injuring me and consequently 'tis  uncertain  whether he will injure me or not I must be uneasy in such a situation and cannot consider the possibility or probability of that injury without a sensible concern The passions are not only affected by such events as are certain and infallible but also in an inferior degree by such as are possible and contingent And tho' perhaps  I never really feel any harm and discover by the event that philosophically speaking the person never had any power of harming me since he did not exert any this prevents not my uneasiness from the preceding uncertainty The agreeable passions may here operate as well as the uneasy and convey a pleasure when I perceive a good to become either possible or probable by the possibility or probability of another's bestowing it on me upon the removal of any strong motives which might formerly have hinder'd him  BUT we may farther observe that this satisfaction encreases when any good approaches in such a manner that it is in one's  own  power to take or leave it and there neither is any physical impediment nor any very strong motive to hinder our enjoyment As all men desire pleasure nothing can be more probable than its existence when there is no external obstacle to the producing it and men perceive no danger in following their inclinations In that case their imagination easily anticipates the satisfaction and conveys the same joy as if they were perswaded of its real and actual existence  BUT this accounts not sufficiently for the satisfaction which attends riches A miser receives delight from his money that is from the  power  it affords him of procuring all the pleasures and conveniences of life tho' he knows he has enjoy'd his riches for forty years without ever employing them and consequently cannot conclude by any species of reasoning that the real existence of these pleasures is nearer than if he were entirely depriv'd of all his possessions But tho' he cannot form any such conclusion in a way of reasoning concerning the nearer approach of the pleasure 'tis certain he  imagines  it to approach nearer whenever all external obstacles are remov'd along with the more powerful motives of interest and danger which oppose it For farther satisfaction on this head I must refer to my account of the will where I shall  Part III Sect  explain that false sensation of liberty which makes us imagine we can perform any thing that is not very dangerous or destructive Whenever any other person is under no strong obligations of interest to forbear any pleasure we judge from  experience  that the pleasure will exist and that he will probably obtain it But when ourselves are  in that situation we judge from an  illusion of the fancy  that the pleasure is still closer and more immediate The will seems to move easily every way and casts a shadow or image of itself even to that side on which it did not settle By means of this image the enjoyment seems to approach nearer to us and gives us the same lively satisfaction as if it were perfectly certain and unavoidable  'TWILL now be easy to draw this whole reasoning to a point and to prove that when riches produce any pride or vanity in their possessors as they never fail to do 'tis only by means of a double relation of impressions and ideas The very essence of riches consists in the power of procuring the pleasures and conveniences of life The very essence of this power consists in the probability of its exercise and in its causing us to anticipate by a  true  or  false  reasoning the real existence of the pleasure This anticipation of pleasure is in itself a very considerable pleasure and as its cause is some possession or property which we enjoy and which is thereby related to us we here clearly see all the parts of the foregoing system most exactly and distinctly drawn out before us  FOR the same reason that riches cause pleasure and pride and poverty excites uneasiness and humility power must produce the former emotions and slavery the latter Power or an authority over others makes us capable of satisfying all our desires as slavery by subjecting us to the will of others exposes us to a thousand wants and mortifications  'TIS here worth observing that the vanity of power or shame of slavery are much augmented by the consideration of the persons over whom we exercise our authority or who exercise it over us For supposing it possible to frame statues of such an admirable mechanism that they cou'd move and act in obedience to the will 'tis evident the possession of them wou'd give pleasure and pride but not to such a degree as the same authority when exerted over sensible and rational creatures whose condition being compar'd to our own makes it seem more agreeable and honourable Comparison is in every case a sure method of augmenting our esteem of any thing A rich man feels the felicity of his condition better by opposing it to that of a beggar But there is a peculiar advantage in power by the contrast which is in a manner  presented to us betwixt ourselves and the person we command The comparison is obvious and natural The imagination finds it in the very subject The passage of the thought to its conception is smooth and easy And that this circumstance has a considerable effect in augmenting its influence will appear afterwards in examining the nature of  malice  and  envy  SECT XI  Of the love of fame  BUT beside these original causes of pride and humility there is a secondary one in the opinions of others which has an equal influence on the affections Our reputation our character our name are considerations of vast weight and importance and even the other causes of pride virtue beauty and riches have little influence when not seconded by the opinions and sentiments of others In order to account for this phaenomenon 'twill be necessary to take some compass and first explain the nature of  sympathy  NO quality of human nature is more remarkable both in itself and in its consequences  than that propensity we have to sympathize with others and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments however different from or even contrary to our own This is not only conspicuous in children who implicitly embrace every opinion propos'd to them but also in men of the greatest judgment and understanding who find it very difficult to follow their own reason or inclination in opposition to that of their friends and daily companions To this principle we ought to ascribe the great uniformity we may observe in the humours and turn of thinking of those of the same nation and 'tis much more probable that this resemblance arises from sympathy than from any influence of the soil and climate which tho' they continue invariably the same are not able to preserve the character of a nation the same for a century together A goodnatur'd man finds himself in an instant of the same humour with his company and even the proudest and most surly take a tincture from their countrymen and acquaintance A chearful countenance infuses a sensible complacency and serenity into my mind as an angry or sorrowful one throws a sudden damp upon me Hatred resentment esteem  love courage mirth and melancholy all these passions I feel more from communication than from my own natural temper and disposition So remarkable a phaenomenon merits our attention and must be trac'd up to its first principles  WHEN any affection is infus'd by sympathy it is at first known only by its effects and by those external signs in the countenance and conversation which convey an idea of it This idea is presently converted into an impression and acquires such a degree of force and vivacity as to become the very passion itself and produce an equal emotion as any original affection However instantaneous this change of the idea into an impression may be it proceeds from certain views and reflections which will not escape the strict scrutiny of a philosopher tho' they may the person himself who makes them  'TIS evident that the idea or rather impression of ourselves is always intimately present with us and that our consciousness gives us so lively a conception of our own person that 'tis not possible to imagine that any thing can in this particular go beyond it Whatever object therefore is related to ourselves must be conceived with  a like vivacity of conception according to the foregoing principles and tho' this relation shou'd not be so strong as that of causation it must still have a considerable influence Resemblance and contiguity are relations not to be neglected especially when by an inference from cause and effect and by the observation of external signs we are inform'd of the real existence of the object which is resembling or contiguous  NOW 'tis obvious that nature has preserv'd a great resemblance among all human creatures and that we never remark any passion or principle in others of which in some degree or other we may not find a parallel in ourselves The case is the same with the fabric of the mind as with that of the body However the parts may differ in shape or size their structure and composition are in general the same There is a very remarkable resemblance which preserves itself amidst all their variety and this resemblance must very much contribute to make us enter into the sentiments of others and embrace them with facility and pleasure Accordingly we find that where beside the general resemblance of our natures there is any peculiar similarity in our manners or character or  country or language it facilitates the sympathy The stronger the relation is betwixt ourselves and any object the more easily does the imagination make the transition and convey to the related idea the vivacity of conception with which we always form the idea of our own person  NOR is resemblance the only relation which has this effect but receives new force from other relations that may accompany it The sentiments of others have little influence when far remov'd from us and require the relation of contiguity to make them communicate themselves entirely The relations of blood being a species of causation may sometimes contribute to the same effect as also acquaintance which operates in the same manner with education and custom as we shall see more fully  Part II Sect  afterwards All these relations when united together convey the impression or consciousness of our own person to the idea of the sentiments or passions of others and makes us conceive them in the strongest and most lively manner  IT has been remark'd in the beginning of this treatise that all ideas are borrow'd from impressions and that these two kinds  of perceptions differ only in the degrees of force and vivacity with which they strike upon the soul The component parts of ideas and impressions are precisely alike The manner and order of their appearance may be the same The different degrees of their force and vivacity are therefore the only particulars that distinguish them And as this difference may be remov'd in some measure by a relation betwixt the impressions and ideas 'tis no wonder an idea of a sentiment or passion may by this means be so inliven'd as to become the very sentiment or passion The lively idea of any object always approaches its impression and 'tis certain we may feel sickness and pain from the mere force of imagination and make a malady real by often thinking of it But this is most remarkable in the opinions and affections and 'tis there principally that a lively idea is converted into an impression Our affections depend more upon ourselves and the internal operations of the mind than any other impressions for which reason they arise more naturally from the imagination and from every lively idea we form of them This is the nature and cause of sympathy and 'tis after this manner we enter so deep into the opinions and  affections of others whenever we discover them  WHAT is principally remarkable in this whole affair is the strong confirmation these phaenomena give to the foregoing system concerning the understanding and consequently to the present one concerning the passions since these are analogous to each other 'Tis indeed evident that when we sympathize with the passions and sentiments of others these movements appear at first in  our  mind as mere ideas and are conceiv'd to belong to another person as we conceive any other matter of fact 'Tis also evident that the ideas of the affections of others are converted into the very impressions they represent and that the passions arise in conformity to the images we form of them All this is an object of the plainest experience and depends not on any hypothesis of philosophy That science can only be admitted to explain the phaenomena tho' at the same time it must be confest they are so clear of themselves that there is but little occasion to employ it For besides the relation of cause and effect by which we are convinc'd of the reality of the passion with which we sympathize besides this I say we must be assisted by the relations  of resemblance and contiguity in order to feel the sympathy in its full perfection And since these relations can entirely convert an idea into an impression and convey the vivacity of the latter into the former so perfectly as to lose nothing of it in the transition we may easily conceive how the relation of cause and effect alone may serve to strengthen and inliven an idea In sympathy there is an evident conversion of an idea into an impression This conversion arises from the relation of objects to ourself Ourself is always intimately present to us Let us compare all these circumstances and we shall find that sympathy is exactly correspondent to the operations of our understanding and even contains something more surprising and extraordinary  'TIS now time to turn our view from the general consideration of sympathy to its influence on pride and humility when these passions arise from praise and blame from reputation and infamy We may observe that no person is ever prais'd by another for any quality which wou'd not if real produce of itself a pride in the person possest of it The elogiums either turn upon his power or riches or family or virtue all of which are subjects of vanity that we have  already explain'd and accounted for 'Tis certain then that if a person consider'd himself in the same light in which he appears to his admirer he wou'd first receive a separate pleasure and afterwards a pride or selfsatisfaction according to the hypothesis above explain'd Now nothing is more natural than for us to embrace the opinions of others in this particular both from  sympathy  which renders all their sentiments intimately present to us and from  reasoning  which makes us regard their judgment as a kind of argument for what they affirm These two principles of authority and sympathy influence almost all our opinions but must have a peculiar influence when we judge of our own worth and character Such judgments are always attended with passion  Book I Part III Sect  and nothing tends more to disturb our understanding and precipitate us into any opinions however unreasonable than their connexion with passion which diffuses itself over the imagination and gives an additional force to every related idea To which we may add that being conscious of great partiality in our own favour we are peculiarly pleas'd with any thing that confirms  the good opinion we have of ourselves and are easily shock'd with whatever opposes it  ALL this appears very probable in theory but in order to bestow a full certainty on this reasoning we must examine the phaenomena of the passions and see if they agree with it  AMONG these phaenomena we may esteem it a very favourable one to our present purpose that tho' fame in general be agreeable yet we receive a much greater satisfaction from the approbation of those whom we ourselves esteem and approve of than of those whom we hate and despise In like manner we are principally mortify'd with the contempt of persons upon whose judgment we set some value and are in a great measure indifferent about the opinions of the rest of mankind But if the mind receiv'd from any original instinct a desire of fame and aversion to infamy fame and infamy wou'd influence us without distinction and every opinion according as it were favourable or unfavourable wou'd equally excite that desire or aversion The judgment of a fool is the judgment of another person as well as that of a wise man and is only inferior in its influence on our own judgment  WE are not only better pleas'd with the approbation of a wise man than with that of a fool but receive an additional satisfaction from the former when 'tis obtain'd after a long and intimate acquaintance This is accounted for after the same manner  THE praises of others never give us much pleasure unless they concur with our own opinion and extol us for those qualities in which we chiefly excel A mere soldier little values the character of eloquence A gownman of courage A bishop of humour Or a merchant of learning Whatever esteem a man may have for any quality abstractedly consider'd when he is conscious he is not possest of it the opinions of the whole world will give him little pleasure in that particular and that because they never will be able to draw his own opinion after them  NOTHING is more usual than for men of good families but narrow circumstances to leave their friends and country and rather seek their livelihood by mean and mechanical employments among strangers than among those who are acquainted with their birth and education We shall be unknown say they where we go No body will suspect from what family we are sprung We  shall be remov'd from all our friends and acquaintance and our poverty and meanness will by that means sit more easy upon us In examining these sentiments I find they afford many very convincing arguments for my present purpose  FIRST We may infer from them that the uneasiness of being contemn'd depends on sympathy and that sympathy depends on the relation of objects to ourselves since we are most uneasy under the contempt of persons who are both related to us by blood and contiguous in place Hence we seek to diminish this sympathy and uneasiness by separating these relations and placing ourselves in a contiguity to strangers and at a distance from relations  SECONDLY We may conclude that relations are requisite to sympathy not absolutely consider'd as relations but by their influence in converting our ideas of the sentiments of others into the very sentiments by means of the association betwixt the idea of their persons and that of our own For here the relations of kindred and contiguity both subsist but not being united in the same persons they contribute in a less degree to the sympathy  THIRDLY This very circumstance of the diminution of sympathy by the separation of relations is worthy of our attention Suppose I am plac'd in a poor condition among strangers and consequently am but lightly treated I yet find myself easier in that situation than when I was every day expos'd to the contempt of my kindred and countrymen Here I feel a double contempt from my relations but they are absent from those about me but they are strangers This double contempt is likewise strengthen'd by the two relations of kindred and contiguity But as the persons are not the same who are connected with me by those two relations this difference of ideas separates the impressions arising from the contempt and keeps them from running into each other The contempt of my neighbours has a certain influence as has also that of my kindred But these influences are distinct and never unite as when the contempt proceeds from persons who are at once both my neighbours and kindred This phaenomenon is analogous to the system of pride and humility aboveexplain'd which may seem so extraordinary to vulgar apprehensions  FOURTHLY A person in these circumstances naturally conceals his birth from those among whom he lives and is very uneasy if any one suspects him to be of a family much superior to his present fortune and way of living Every thing in this world is judg'd of by comparison What is an immense fortune for a private gentleman is beggary for a prince A peasant wou'd think himself happy in what cannot afford necessaries for a gentleman When a man has either been acustom'd to a more splendid way of living or thinks himself intitled to it by his birth and quality every thing below is disagreeable and even shameful and 'tis with the greatest industry he conceals his pretensions to a better fortune Here he himself knows his misfortunes but as those with whom he lives are ignorant of them he has the disagreeable reflection and comparison suggested only by his own thoughts and never receives it by a sympathy with others which must contribute very much to his ease and satisfaction  IF there be any objections to this hypothesis  that the pleasure which we receive from praise arises from a communication of sentiments  we shall find upon examination that these objections when taken in a proper  light will serve to confirm it Popular fame may be agreeable even to a man who despises the vulgar but 'tis because their multitude gives them additional weight and authority Plagiaries are delighted with praises which they are conscious they do not deserve but this is a kind of castlebuilding where the imagination amuses itself with its own fictions and strives to render them firm and stable by a sympathy with the sentiments of others Proud men are most shock'd with contempt tho' they do not most readily assent to it but 'tis because of the opposition betwixt the passion which is natural to them and that receiv'd by sympathy A violent lover in like manner is very much displeas'd when you blame and condemn his love tho' 'tis evident your opposition can have no influence but by the hold it takes of himself and by his sympathy with you If he despises you or perceives you are in jest whatever you say has no effect upon him  SECT XII  Of the pride and humility of animals  THUS in whatever light we consider this subject we may still observe that the causes of pride and humility correspond exactly to our hypothesis and that nothing can excite either of these passions unless it be both related to ourselves and produces a pleasure or pain independent of the passion We have not only prov'd that a tendency to produce pleasure or pain is common to all the causes of pride or humility but also that 'tis the only thing which is common and consequently is the quality by which they operate We have farther prov'd that the most considerable causes of these passions are really nothing but the power of producing either agreeable or uneasy sensations and therefore that all their effects and amongst the rest pride and humility are deriv'd solely from that origin Such simple and natural principles founded on such solid proofs cannot fail to be receiv'd  by philosophers unless oppos'd by some objections that have escap'd me  'TIS usual with anatomists to join their observations and experiments on human bodies to those on beasts and from the agreement of these experiments to derive an additional argument for any particular hypothesis 'Tis indeed certain that where the structure of parts in brutes is the same as in men and the operation of these parts also the same the causes of that operation cannot be different and that whatever we discover to be true of the one species may be concluded without hesitation to be certain of the other Thus tho' the mixture of humours and the composition of minute parts may justly be presum'd to be somewhat different in men from what it is in mere animals and therefore any experiment we make upon the one concerning the effects of medicines will not always apply to the other yet as the structure of the veins and muscles the fabric and situation of the heart of the lungs the stomach the liver and other parts are the same or nearly the same in all animals the very same hypothesis which in one species explains muscular motion the progress of the chyle the circulation of the blood must be applicable to every  one and according as it agrees or disagrees with the experiments we may make in any species of creatures we may draw a proof of its truth or falshood on the whole Let us therefore apply this method of enquiry which is found so just and useful in reasonings concerning the body to our present anatomy of the mind and see what discoveries we can make by it  IN order to this we must first shew the correspondence of  passions  in men and animals and afterwards compare the  causes  which produce these passions  'TIS plain that almost in every species of creatures but especially of the nobler kind there are many evident marks of pride and humility The very port and gait of a swan or turkey or peacock show the high idea he has entertain'd of himself and his contempt of all others This is the more remarkable that in the two last species of animals the pride always attends the beauty and is discover'd in the male only The vanity and emulation of nightingales in singing have been commonly remark'd as likewise that of horses in swiftness of hounds in sagacity and smell of the bull and cock in strength and of every other animal in  his particular excellency Add to this that every species of creatures which approach so often to man as to familiarize themselves with him show an evident pride in his approbation and are pleas'd with his praises and caresses independent of every other consideration Nor are they the caresses of every one without distinction which give them this vanity but those principally of the persons they know and love in the same manner as that passion is excited in mankind All these are evident proofs that pride and humility are not merely human passions but extend themselves over the whole animal creation  THE  causes  of these passions are likewise much the same in beasts as in us making a just allowance for our superior knowledge and understanding Thus animals have little or no sense of virtue or vice they quickly lose sight of the relations of blood and are incapable of that of right and property For which reason the causes of their pride and humility must lie solely in the body and can never be plac'd either in the mind or external objects But so far as regards the body the same qualities cause pride in the animal as in the human kind and 'tis on beauty strength swiftness or some other  useful or agreeable quality that this passion is always founded  THE next question is whether since those passions are the same and arise from the same causes thro' the whole creation the  manner  in which the causes operate be also the same According to all rules of analogy this is justly to be expected and if we find upon trial that the explication of these phaenomena which we make use of in one species will not apply to the rest we may presume that that explication however specious is in reality without foundation  IN order to decide this question let us consider that there is evidently the same  relation  of ideas and deriv'd from the same causes in the minds of animals as in those of men A dog that has hid a bone often forgets the place but when brought to it his thought passes easily to what he formerly conceal'd by means of the contiguity which produces a relation among his ideas In like manner when he has been heartily beat in any place he will tremble on his approach to it even tho' he discover no signs of any present danger The effects of resemblance are not so remarkable but as that  relation makes a considerable ingredient in causation of which all animals shew so evident a judgment we may conclude that the three relations of resemblance contiguity and causation operate in the same manner upon beasts as upon human creatures  THERE are also instances of the relation of impressions sufficient to convince us that there is an union of certain affections with each other in the inferior species of creatures as well as in the superior and that their minds are frequently convey'd thro' a series of connected emotions A dog when elevated with joy runs naturally into love and kindness whether of his master or of the sex In like manner when full of pain and sorrow he becomes quarrelsome and illnatur'd and that passion which at first was grief is by the smallest occasion converted into anger  THUS all the internal principles that are necessary in us to produce either pride or humility are common to all creatures and since the causes which excite these passions are likewise the same we may justly conclude that these causes operate after the same  manner  thro' the whole animal creation My hypothesis is so simple  and supposes so little reflection and judgement that 'tis applicable to every sensible creature which must not only be allow'd to be a convincing proof of its veracity but I am confident will be found an objection to every other system  PART II  Of love and hatred  SECT I  Of the object and causes of love and hatred  _TIS altogether impossible to give any definition of the passions of  love  and  hatred  and that because they produce merely a simple impression without any mixture or composition 'Twou'd be as unnecessary to attempt any description of them drawn from their nature origin causes and objects and that both because these are the subjects of our present enquiry and because these passions of themselves are sufficiently known from our common feeling and experience This we have already observ'd concerning pride and  humility and here repeat it concerning love and hatred and indeed there is so great a resemblance betwixt these two sets of passions that we shall be oblig'd to begin with a kind of abridgment of our reasonings concerning the former in order to explain the latter  As the immediate  object  of pride and humility is self or that identical person of whose thoughts actions and sensations we are intimately conscious so the  object  of love and hatred is some other person of whose thoughts actions and sensations we are not conscious This is sufficiently evident from experience Our love and hatred are always directed to some sensible being external to us and when we talk of  selflove  'tis not in a proper sense nor has the sensation it produces any thing in common with that tender emotion which is excited by a friend or mistress 'Tis the same case with hatred We may be mortified by our own faults and follies but never feel any anger or hatred except from the injuries of others  BUT tho' the object of love and hatred be always some other person 'tis plain that the object is not properly speaking the  cause  of these passions or alone sufficient to  excite them For since love and hatred are directly contrary in their sensation and have the same object in common if that object were also their cause it wou'd produce these opposite passions in an equal degree and as they must from the very first moment destroy each other none of them wou'd ever be able to make its appearance There must therefore be some cause different from the object  IF we consider the causes of love and hatred we shall find they are very much diversify'd and have not many things in common The virtue knowledge wit good sense good humour of any person produce love and esteem as the opposite qualities hatred and contempt The same passions arise from bodily accomplishments such as beauty force swiftness dexterity and from their contraries as likewise from the external advantages and disadvantages of family possessions cloaths nation and climate There is not one of these objects but what by its different qualities may produce love and esteem or hatred and contempt  FROM the view of these causes we may derive a new distinction betwixt the  quality  that operates and the  subject  on which it  is plac'd A prince that is possess'd of a stately palace commands the esteem of the people upon that account and that  first  by the beauty of the palace and  secondly  by the relation of property which connects it with him The removal of either of these destroys the passion which evidently proves that the cause is a compounded one  'TWOU'D be tedious to trace the passions of love and hatred thro' all the observations which we have form'd concerning pride and humility and which are equally applicable to both sets of passions 'Twill be sufficient to  remark  in general that the object of love and hatred is evidently some thinking person and that the sensation of the former passion is always agreeable and of the latter uneasy We may also  suppose  with some shew of probability  that the cause of both these passions is always related to a thinking being  and  that the cause of the former produce a separate pleasure and of the latter a separate uneasiness  ONE of these suppositions  viz  that the cause of love and hatred must be related to a person or thinking being in order to produce these passions is not only probable but too evident to be contested Virtue and vice when consider'd in the abstract beauty  and deformity when plac'd on inanimate objects poverty and riches when belonging to a third person excite no degree of love or hatred esteem or contempt towards those who have no relation to them A person looking out at a window sees me in the street and beyond me a beautiful palace with which I have no concern I believe none will pretend that this person will pay me the same respect as if I were owner of the palace  'TIS not so evident at first sight that a relation of impressions is requisite to these passions and that because in the transition the one impression is so much confounded with the other that they become in a manner undistinguishable But as in pride and humility we have easily been able to make the separation and to prove that every cause of these passions produces a separate pain or pleasure I might here observe the same method with the same success in examining particularly the several causes of love and hatred But as I hasten to a full and decisive proof of these systems I delay this examination for a moment And in the mean time shall endeavour to convert to my present purpose all my reasonings concerning pride and humility  by an argument that is founded on unquestionable experience  THERE are few persons that are satisfy'd with their own character or genius or fortune who are not desirous of shewing themselves to the world and of acquiring the love and approbation of mankind Now 'tis evident that the very same qualities and circumstances which are the causes of pride or selfesteem are also the causes of vanity or the desire of reputation and that we always put to view those particulars with which in ourselves we are best satisfy'd But if love and esteem were not produc'd by the same qualities as pride according as these qualities are related to ourselves or others this method of proceeding wou'd be very absurd nor cou'd men expect a correspondence in the sentiments of every other person with those themselves have entertain'd 'Tis true few can form exact systems of the passions or make reflections on their general nature and resemblances But without such a progress in philosophy we are not subject to many mistakes in this particular but are sufficiently guided by common experience as well as by a kind of  presensation  which tells us what will operate on others by what we feel immediately  in ourselves Since then the same qualities that produce pride or humility cause love or hatred all the arguments that have been employ'd to prove that the causes of the former passions excite a pain or pleasure independent of the passion will be applicable with equal evidence to the causes of the latter  SECT II  Experiments to confirm this system  UPON duly weighing these arguments no one will make any scruple to assent to that conclusion I draw from them concerning the transition along related impressions and ideas especially as 'tis a principle in itself so easy and natural But that we may place this system beyond doubt both with regard to love and hatred pride and humility 'twill be proper to make some new experiments upon all these passions as well as to recal a few of these observations which I have formerly touch'd upon  IN order to make these experiments let us suppose I am in company with a person whom I formerly regarded without any sentiments  either of friendship or enmity Here I have the natural and ultimate object of all these four passions plac'd before me Myself am the proper object of pride or humility the other person of love or hatred  REGARD now with attention the nature of these passions and their situation with respect to each other 'Tis evident here are four affections plac'd as it were in a square or regular connexion with and distance from each other The passions of pride and humility as well as those of love and hatred are connected together by the identity of their object which to the first set of passions is self to the second some other person These two lines of communication or connexion form two opposite sides of the square Again pride and love are agreeable passions hatred and humility uneasy This similitude of sensation betwixt pride and love and that betwixt humility and hatred form a new connexion and may be consider'd as the other two sides of the square Upon the whole pride is connected with humility love with hatred by their objects or ideas Pride with love humility with hatred by their sensations or impressions  I SAY then that nothing can produce any of these passions without bearing it a double relation  viz  of ideas to the object of the passion and of sensation to the passion itself This we must prove by our experiments  FIRST EXPERIMENT To proceed with the greater order in these experiments let us first suppose that being plac'd in the situation abovemention'd  viz  in company with some other person there is an object presented that has no relation either of impressions or ideas to any of these passions Thus suppose we regard together an ordinary stone or other common object belonging to neither of us and causing of itself no emotion or independent pain and pleasure 'Tis evident such an object will produce none of these four passions Let us try it upon each of them successively Let us apply it to love to hatred to humility to pride none of them ever arises in the smallest degree imaginable Let us change the object as oft as we please provided still we choose one that has neither of these two relations Let us repeat the experiment in all the dispositions of which the mind is susceptible No object in the vast variety of nature will in any disposition  produce any passion without these relations  SECOND EXPERIMENT Since an object that wants both these relations can ever produce any passion let us bestow on it only one of these relations and see what will follow Thus suppose I regard a stone or any common object that belongs either to me or my companion and by that means acquires a relation of ideas to the object of the passions 'Tis plain that to consider the matter  a priori  no emotion of any kind can reasonably be expected For besides that a relation of ideas operates secretly and calmly on the mind it bestows an equal impulse towards the opposite passions of pride and humility love and hatred according as the object belongs to ourselves or others which opposition of the passions must destroy both and leave the mind perfectly free from any affection or emotion This reasoning  a priori  is confirm'd by experience No trivial or vulgar object that causes not a pain or pleasure independent of the passion will ever by its property or other relations either to ourselves or others be able to produce the affections of pride or humility love or hatred  THIRD EXPERIMENT 'Tis evident therefore that a relation of ideas is not able alone to give rise to these affections Let us now remove this relation and in its stead place a relation of impressions by presenting an object which is agreeable or disagreeable but has no relation either to ourself or companion and let us observe the consequences To consider the matter first  a priori  as in the preceding experiment we may conclude that the object will have a small but an uncertain connexion with these passions For besides that this relation is not a cold and imperceptible one it has not the inconvenience of the relation of ideas nor directs us with equal force to two contrary passions which by their opposition destroy each other But if we consider on the other hand that this transition from the sensation to the affection is not forwarded by any principle that produces a transition of ideas but on the contrary that tho' the one impression be easily transfus'd into the other yet the change of objects is suppos'd contrary to all the principles that cause a transition of that kind we may from thence infer that nothing will ever be a steady or durable cause of any passion that is connected with the passion merely by a  relation of impressions What our reason wou'd conclude from analogy after ballancing these arguments wou'd be that an object which produces pleasure or uneasiness but has no manner of connexion either with ourselves or others may give such a turn to the disposition as that it may naturally fall into pride or love humility or hatred and search for other objects upon which by a double relation it can found these affections but that an object which has only one of these relations tho' the most advantageous one can never give rise to any constant and establish'd passion  MOST fortunately all this reasoning is found to be exactly conformable to experience and the phaenomena of the passions Suppose I were travelling with a companion thro' a country to which we are both utter strangers 'tis evident that if the prospects be beautiful the roads agreeable and the inns commodious this may put me into good humour both with myself and fellowtraveller But as we suppose that this country has no relation either to myself or friend it can never be the immediate cause of pride or love and therefore if I found not the passion on some other object that bears either of us a closer relation my emotions  are rather to be consider'd as the overflowings of an elevate or humane disposition than as an establish'd passion The case is the same where the object produces uneasiness  FOURTH EXPERIMENT Having found that neither an object without any relation of ideas or impressions nor an object that has only one relation can ever cause pride or humility love or hatred reason alone may convince us without any farther experiment that whatever has a double relation must necessarily excite these passions since 'tis evident they must have some cause But to leave as little room for doubt as possible let us renew our experiments and see whether the event in this case answers our expectation I choose an object such as virtue that causes a separate satisfaction On this object I bestow a relation to self and find that from this disposition of affairs there immediately arises a passion But what passion That very one of pride to which this object bears a double relation Its idea is related to that of self the object of the passion The sensation it causes resembles the sensation of the passion That I may be sure I am not mistaken in this experiment I remove first one relation then  another and find that each removal destroys the passion and leaves the object perfectly indifferent But I am not content with this I make a still farther trial and instead of removing the relation I only change it for one of a different kind I suppose the virtue to belong to my companion not to myself and observe what follows from this alteration I immediately perceive the affections wheel about and leaving pride where there is only one relation  viz  of impressions fall to the side of love where they are attracted by a double relation of impressions and ideas By repeating the same experiment in changing anew the relation of ideas I bring the affections back to pride and by a new repetition I again place them at love or kindness Being fully convinc'd of the influence of this relation I try the effects of the other and by changing virtue for vice convert the pleasant impression which arises from the former into the disagreeable one which proceeds from the latter The effect still answers expectation Vice when plac'd on another excites by means of its double relations the passion of hatred instead of love which for the same reason arises from virtue To continue the experiment I change anew the relation  of ideas and suppose the vice to belong to myself What follows What is usual A subsequent change of the passion from hatred to humility This humility I convert into pride by a new change of the impression and find after all that I have compleated the round and have by these changes brought back the passion to that very situation in which I first found it  BUT to make the matter still more certain I alter the object and instead of vice and virtue make the trial upon beauty and deformity riches and poverty power and servitude Each of these objects runs the circle of the passions in the same manner by a change of their relations And in whatever order we proceed whether thro' pride love hatred humility or thro' humility hatred love pride the experiment is not in the least diversify'd Esteem and contempt indeed arise on some occasions instead of love and hatred but these are at the bottom the same passions only diversify'd by some causes which we shall explain afterwards  FIFTH EXPERIMENT To give greater authority to these experiments let us change the situation of affairs as much as possible and place the passions and objects in all the  different positions of which they are susceptible Let us suppose beside the relations abovemention'd that the person along with whom I make all these experiments is closely connected with me either by blood or friendship He is we shall suppose my son or brother or is united to me by a long and familiar acquaintance Let us next suppose that the cause of the passion acquires a double relation of impressions and ideas to this person and let us see what the effects are of all these complicated attractions and relations  BEFORE we consider what they are in fact let us determine what they ought to be conformable to my hypothesis 'Tis plain that according as the impression is either pleasant or uneasy the passion of love or hatred must arise towards the person who is thus connected to the cause of the impression by these double relations which I have all along requir'd The virtue of a brother must make me love him as his vice or infamy must excite the contrary passion But to judge only from the situation of affairs I shou'd not expect that the affections wou'd rest there and never transfuse themselves into any other impression As there is here a person who by means of  a double relation is the object of my passion the very same reasoning leads me to think the passion will be carry'd farther The person has a relation of ideas to myself according to the supposition the passion of which he is the object by being either agreeable or uneasy has a relation of impressions to pride or humility 'Tis evident then that one of these passions must arise from the love or hatred  THIS is the reasoning I form in conformity to my hypothesis and am pleas'd to find upon trial that every thing answers exactly to my expectation The virtue or vice of a son or brother not only excites love or hatred but by a new transition from similar causes gives rise to pride or humility Nothing causes greater vanity than any shining quality in our relations as nothing mortifies us more than their vice or infamy This exact conformity of experience to our reasoning is a convincing proof of the solidity of that hypothesis upon which we reason  SIXTH EXPERIMENT This evidence will be still augmented if we reverse the experiment and preserving still the same relations begin only with a different passion  Suppose that instead of the virtue or vice of a son or brother which causes first love or hatred and afterwards pride or humility we place these good or bad qualities on ourselves without any immediate connexion with the person who is related to us Experience shews us that by this change of situation the whole chain is broke and that the mind is not convey'd from one passion to another as in the preceding instance We never love or hate a son or brother for the virtue or vice we discern in ourselves tho' 'tis evident the same qualities in him give us a very sensible pride or humility The transition from pride or humility to love or hatred is not so natural as from love or hatred to pride or humility This may at first sight be esteem'd contrary to my hypothesis since the relations of impressions and ideas are in both cases precisely the same Pride and humility are impressions related to love and hatred Myself am related to the person It shou'd therefore be expected that like causes must produce like effects and a perfect transition arise from the double relation as in all other cases This difficulty we may easily solve by the following reflections  'TIS evident that as we are at all times intimately conscious of ourselves our sentiments and passions their ideas must strike upon us with greater vivacity than the ideas of the sentiments and passions of any other person But every thing that strikes upon us with vivacity and appears in a full and strong light forces itself in a manner into our consideration and becomes present to the mind on the smallest hint and most trivial relation For the same reason when it is once present it engages the attention and keeps it from wandering to other objects however strong may be their relation to our first object The imagination passes easily from obscure to lively ideas but with difficulty from lively to obscure In the one case the relation is aided by another principle In the other case 'tis oppos'd by it  Now I have observ'd that those two faculties of the mind the imagination and passions assist each other in their operation when their propensities are similar and when they act upon the same object The mind has always a propensity to pass from a passion to any other related to it and this propensity is forwarded when the object of the one passion is related to that of the other The two impulses concur with each  other and render the whole transition more smooth and easy But if it shou'd happen that while the relation of ideas strictly speaking continues the same its influence in causing a transition of the imagination shou'd no longer take place 'tis evident its influence on the passions must also cease as being dependent entirely on that transition This is the reason why pride or humility is not transfus'd into love or hatred with the same ease that the latter passions are chang'd into the former If a person be my brother I am his likewise But tho' the relations be reciprocal they have very different effects on the imagination The passage is smooth and open from the consideration of any person related to us to that of ourself of whom we are every moment conscious But when the affections are once directed to ourself the fancy passes not with the same facility from that object to any other person how closely so ever connected with us This easy or difficult transition of the imagination operates upon the passions and facilitates or retards their transition which is a clear proof that these two faculties of the passions and imagination are connected together and that the relations of ideas have an influence upon the  affections Besides innumerable experiments that prove this we here find that even when the relation remains if by any particular circumstance its usual effect upon the fancy in producing an association or transition of ideas is prevented its usual effect upon the passions in conveying us from one to another is in like manner prevented  SOME may perhaps find a contradiction betwixt this phaenomenon and that of sympathy where the mind passes easily from the idea of ourselves to that of any other object related to us But this difficulty will vanish if we consider that in sympathy our own person is not the object of any passion nor is there any thing that fixes our attention on ourselves as in the present case where we are suppos'd to be actuated with pride or humility Ourself independent of the perception of every other object is in reality nothing For which reason we must turn our view to external objects and 'tis natural for us to consider with most attention such as lie contiguous to us or resemble us But when self is the object of a passion 'tis not natural to quit the consideration of it till the passion be exhausted in which case the double relations of impressions and ideas can no longer operate  SEVENTH EXPERIMENT To put this whole reasoning to a farther trial let us make a new experiment and as we have already seen the effects of related passions and ideas let us here suppose an identity of passions along with a relation of ideas and let us consider the effects of this new situation 'Tis evident a transition of the passions from the one object to the other is here in all reason to be expected since the relation of ideas is suppos'd still to continue and an identity of impressions must produce a stronger connexion than the most perfect resemblance that can be imagin'd If a double relation therefore of impressions and ideas is able to produce a transition from one to the other much more an identity of impressions with a relation of ideas Accordingly we find that when we either love or hate any person the passions seldom continue within their first bounds but extend themselves towards all the contiguous objects and comprehend the friends and relations of him we love or hate Nothing is more natural than to bear a kindness to one brother on account of our friendship for another without any farther examination of his character A quarrel with one person gives us a hatred for the whole family  tho' entirely innocent of that which displeases us Instances of this kind are every where to be met with  THERE is only one difficulty in this experiment which it will be necessary to account for before we proceed any farther 'Tis evident that tho' all passions pass easily from one object to another related to it yet this transition is made with greater facility where the more considerable object is first presented and the lesser follows it than where this order is revers'd and the lesser takes the precedence Thus 'tis more natural for us to love the son upon account of the father than the father upon account of the son the servant for the master than the master for the servant the subject for the prince than the prince for the subject In like manner we more readily contract a hatred against a whole family where our first quarrel is with the head of it than where we are displeas'd with a son or servant or some inferior member In short our passions like other objects descend with greater facility than they ascend  THAT we may comprehend wherein consists the difficulty of explaining this phaenomenon we must consider that the very same reason which determines the imagination  to pass from remote to contiguous objects with more facility than from contiguous to remote causes it likewise to change with more ease the less for the greater than the greater for the less Whatever has the greatest influence is most taken notice of and whatever is most taken notice of presents itself most readily to the imagination We are more apt to overlook in any subject what is trivial than what appears of considerable moment but especially if the latter takes the precedence and first engages our attention Thus if any accident makes us consider the  Satellites  of  Jupiter  our fancy is naturally determin'd to form the idea of that planet but if we first reflect on the principal planet 'tis more natural for us to overlook its attendants The mention of the provinces of any empire conveys our thought to the seat of the empire but the fancy returns not with the same facility to the consideration of the provinces The idea of the servant makes us think of the master that of the subject carries our view to the prince But the same relation has not an equal influence in conveying us back again And on this is founded that reproach of  Cornelia  to her sons that they ought to be asham'd she  shou'd be more known by the title of the daughter of  Scipio  than by that of the mother of the  Gracchi  This was in other words exhorting them to render themselves as illustrious and famous as their grandfather otherwise the imagination of the people passing from her who was intermediate and plac'd in an equal relation to both wou'd always leave them and denominate her by what was more considerable and of greater moment On the same principle is founded that common custom of making wives bear the name of their husbands rather than husbands that of their wives as also the ceremony of giving the precedency to those whom we honour and respect We might find many other instances to confirm this principle were it not already sufficiently evident  NOW since the fancy finds the same facility in passing from the lesser to the greater as from remote to contiguous why does not this easy transition of ideas assist the transition of passions in the former case as well as in the latter The virtues of a friend or brother produce first love and then pride because in that case the imagination passes from remote to contiguous according to its propensity Our own virtues produce not first pride and then love to a friend or  brother because the passage in that case wou'd be from contiguous to remote contrary to its propensity But the love or hatred of an inferior causesnot readily any passion to the superior tho' that be the natural propensity of the imagination While the love or hatred of a superior causes a passion to the inferior contrary to its propensity In short the same facility of transition operates not in the same manner upon superior and inferior as upon contiguous and remote These two phaenomena appear contradictory and require some attention to be reconcil'd  As the transition of ideas is here made contrary to the natural propensity of the imagination that faculty must be overpower'd by some stronger principle of another kind and as there is nothing ever present to the mind but impressions and ideas this principle must necessarily lie in the impressions Now it has been observ'd that impressions or passions are connected only by their resemblance and that where any two passions place the mind in the same or in similar dispositions it very naturally passes from the one to the other As on the contrary a repugnance in the dispositions produces a difficulty in the transition  of the possions But 'tis observable that this repugnance may arise from a difference of degree as well as of kind nor do we experience a greater difficulty in passing suddenly from a small degree of love to a small degree of hatred than from a small to a great degree of either of these affections A man when calm or only moderately agitated is so different in every respect from himself when disturbed with a violent passion that no two persons can be more unlike nor is it easy to pass from the one extreme to the other without a considerable interval betwixt them  THE difficulty is not less if it be not rather greater in passing from the strong passion to the weak than in passing from the weak to the strong provided the one passion upon its appearance destroys the other and they do not both of them exist at once But the case is entirely alter'd when the passions unite together and actuate the mind at the same time A weak passion when added to a strong makes not so considerable change in the disposition as a strong when added to a weak for which reason there is a closer connexion betwixt the great degree and the small than betwixt the small degree and the great  THE degree of any passion depends upon the nature of its object and an affection directed to a person who is considerable in our eyes fills and possesses the mind much more than one which has for its object a person we esteem of less consequence Here then the contradiction betwixt the propensities of the imagination and passion displays itself When we turn our thought to a great and a small object the imagination finds more facility in passing from the small to the great than from the great to the small but the affections find a greater difficulty And as the affections are a more powerful principle than the imagination no wonder they prevail over it and draw the mind to their side In spite of the difficulty of passing from the idea of great to that of little a passion directed to the former produces always a similar passion towards the latter when the great and little are related together The idea of the servant conveys our thought most readily to the master but the hatred or love of the master produces with greater facility anger or goodwill to the servant The strongest passion in this case takes the precedence and the addition of the weaker making no considerable change on the disposition  the passage is by that means render'd more easy and natural betwixt them  As in the foregoing experiment we found that a relation of ideas which by any particular circumstance ceases to produce its usual effect of facilitating the transition of ideas ceases likewise to operate on the passions so in the present experiment we find the same property of the impressions Two different degrees of the same passion are surely related together but if the smaller be first present it has little or no tendency to introduce the greater and that because the addition of the great to the little produces a more sensible alteration on the temper than the addition of the little to the great These phaenomena when duly weigh'd will be found convincing proofs of this hypothesis  AND these proofs will be confirm'd if we consider the manner in which the mind here reconciles the contradiction I have observ'd betwixt the passions and the imagination The fancy passes with more facility from the less to the greater than from the greater to the less But on the contrary a violent passion produces more easily a feeble than that does a violent In this opposition the passion in the end prevails  over the imagination but 'tis commonly by complying with it and by seeking another quality which may counterballance that principle from whence the opposition arises When we love the father or master of a family we little think of his children or servants But when these are present with us or when it lies any ways in our power to serve them the nearness and contiguity in this case encreases their magnitude or at least removes that opposition which the fancy makes to the transition of the affections If the imagination finds a difficulty in passing from greater to less it finds an equal facility in passing from remote to contiguous which brings the matter to an equality and leaves the way open from the one passion to the other  EIGHTH EXPERIMENT I have observ'd that the transition from love or hatred to pride or humility is more easy than from pride or humility to love or hatred and that the difficulty which the imagination finds in passing from contiguous to remote is the cause why we scarce have any instance of the latter transition of the affections I must however make one exception  viz  when the very cause of the pride and humility is plac'd in some other  person For in that case the imagination is necessitated to consider the person nor can it possibly confine its view to ourselves Thus nothing more readily produces kindness and affection to any person than his approbation of our conduct and character As on the other hand nothing inspires us with a stronger hatred than his blame or contempt Here 'tis evident that the original passion is pride or humility whose object is self and that this passion is transfus'd into love or hatred whose object is some other person notwithstanding the rule I have already establish'd  that the imagination passes with difficulty from contiguous to remote  But the transition in this case is not made merely on account of the relation betwixt ourselves and the person but because that very person is the real cause of our first passion and of consequence is intimately connected with it 'Tis his approbation that produces pride and disapprobation humility No wonder then the imagination returns back again attended with the related passions of love and hatred This is not a contradiction but an exception to the rule and an exception that arises from the same reason with the rule itself  SUCH an exception as this is therefore rather a confirmation of the rule And indeed if we consider all the eight experiments I have explain'd we shall find that the same principle appears in all of them and that 'tis by means of a transition arising from a double relation of impressions and ideas pride and humility love and hatred are produc'd An object without  First Experiment  a relation or  Second and Third Experiments  with but one never produces either of these passions and 'tis  Fourth Experiment  found that the passion always varies in conformity to the relation Nay we may observe that where the relation by any particular circumstance has not its usual effect of producing a transition either of  Sixth Experiment  ideas or of impressions it ceases to operate upon the passions and gives rise neither to pride nor love humility nor hatred This rule we find still to hold good  Seventh and Eighth Experiments  even under the appearance of its contrary and as relation is frequently experienc'd to have no effect which upon examination is found to proceed from some particular circumstance that prevents the transition so even in instances where that circumstance tho' present prevents not the  transition 'tis found to arise from some other circumstance which counterballances it Thus not only the variations resolve themselves into the general principle but even the variations of these variations  SECT III  Difficulties solv'd  AFTER so many and such undeniable proofs drawn from daily experience and observation it may seem superfluous to enter into a particular examination of all the causes of love and hatred I shall therefore employ the sequel of this part  First  In removing some difficulties concerning particular causes of these passions  Secondly  In examining the compound affections which arise from the mixture of love and hatred with other emotions  NOTHING is more evident than that any person acquires our kindness or is expos'd to our illwill in proportion to the pleasure or uneasiness we receive from him and that the passions keep pace exactly with the sensations in all their changes and variations Whoever can find the means either by his services his beauty or his flattery to render  himself useful or agreeable to us is sure of our affections As on the other hand whoever harms or displeases us never fails to excite our anger or hatred When our own nation is at war with any other we detest them under the character of cruel perfidious unjust and violent But always esteem ourselves and allies equitable moderate and merciful If the general of our enemies be successful 'tis with difficulty we allow him the figure and character of a man He is a sorcerer He has a communication with daemons as is reported of  Oliver Cromwell  and the  Duke of Luxembourg  He is bloodyminded and takes a pleasure in death and destruction But if the success be on our side our commander has all the opposite good qualities and is a pattern of virtue as well as of courage and conduct His treachery we call policy His cruelty is an evil inseparable from war In short every one of his faults we either endeavour to extenuate or dignify it with the name of that virtue which approaches it 'Tis evident the same method of thinking runs thro' common life  THERE are some who add another condition and require not only that the pain and pleasure arise from the person but likewise  that it arise knowingly and with a particular design and intention A man who wounds and harms us by accident becomes not our enemy upon that account nor do we think ourselves bound by any ties of gratitude to one who does us any service after the same manner By the intention we judge of the actions and according as that is good or bad they become causes of love or hatred  BUT here we must make a distinction If that quality in another which pleases or displeases be constant and inherent in his person and character it will cause love or hatred independent of the intention But otherwise a knowledge and design is requisite in order to give rise to these passions One that is disagreeable by his deformity or folly is the object of our aversion tho' nothing be more certain than that he has not the least intention of displeasing us by these qualities But if the uneasiness proceed not from a quality but an action which is produc'd and annihilated in a moment 'tis necessary in order to produce some relation and connect this action sufficiently with the person that it be deriv'd from a particular forethought and design 'Tis not enough that the action arise from the  person and have him for its immediate cause and author This relation alone is too feeble and inconstant to be a foundation for these passions It reaches not the sensible and thinking part and neither proceeds from any thing  durable  in him nor leaves any thing behind it but passes in a moment and is as if it had never been On the other hand an intention shews certain qualities which remaining after the action is perform'd connect it with the person and facilitate the transition of ideas from one to the other We can never think of him without reflecting on these qualities unless repentance and a change of life have produc'd an alteration in that respect In which case the passion is likewise alter'd This therefore is one reason why an intention is requisite to excite either love or hatred  BUT we must farther consider that an intention besides its strengthening the relation of ideas is often necessary to produce a relation of impressions and give rise to pleasure and uneasiness For 'tis observable that the principal part of an injury is the contempt and hatred which it shews in the person that injures us and without that the mere harm gives us a less sensible  uneasiness In like manner a good office is agreeable chiefly because it flatters our vanity and is a proof of the kindness and esteem of the person who performs it The removal of the intention removes the mortification in the one case and vanity in the other and must of course cause a remarkable diminution in the passions of love and hatred  I GRANT that these effects of the removal of design in diminishing the relations of impressions and ideas are not entire nor able to remove every degree of these relations But then I ask if the removal of design be able entirely to remove the passion of love and hatred Experience I am sure informs us of the contrary nor is there any thing more certain than that men often fall into a violent anger for injuries which they themselves must own to be entirely involuntary and accidental This emotion indeed cannot be of long continuance but still is sufficient to shew that there is a natural connexion betwixt uneasiness and anger and that the relation of impressions will operate upon a very small relation of ideas But when the violence of the impression is once a little abated the defect of the relation begins to be better felt  and as the character of a person is no wise interested in such injuries as are casual and involuntary it seldom happens that on their account we entertain a lasting enmity  To illustrate this doctrine by a parallel instance we may observe that not only the uneasiness which proceeds from another by accident has but little force to excite our passion but also that which arises from an acknowledg'd necessity and duty One that has a real design of harming us proceeding not from hatred and illwill but from justice and equity draws not upon him our anger if we be in any degree reasonable notwithstanding he is both the cause and the knowing cause of our sufferings Let us examine a little this phaenomenon  'TIS evident in the first place that this circumstance is not decisive and tho' it may be able to diminish the passions 'tis seldom it can entirely remove them How few criminals are there who have no illwill to the person that accuses them or to the judge that condemns them even tho' they be conscious of their own deserts In like manner our antagonist in a lawsuit and our competitor for any  office are commonly regarded as our enemies tho' we must acknowledge if we wou'd but reflect a moment that their motive is entirely as justifiable as our own  BESIDES we may consider that when we receive harm from any person we are apt to imagine him criminal and 'tis with extreme difficulty we allow of his justice and innocence This is a clear proof that independent of the opinion of iniquity any harm of uneasiness has a natural tendency to excite our hatred and that afterwards we seek for reasons upon which we may justify and establish the passion Here the idea of injury produces not the passion but arises from it  NOR is it any wonder that passion shou'd produce the opinion of injury since otherwise it must suffer a considerable diminution which all the passions avoid as much possible The removal of injury may remove the anger without proving that the anger arises only from the injury The harm and the justice are two contrary objects of which the one has a tendency to produce hatred and the other love and 'tis according to their different degrees and our particular turn of thinking that either  of the objects prevails and excites its proper passion  SECT IV  Of the love of relations  HAVING given a reason why several actions that cause a real pleasure or uneasiness excite not any degree or but a small one of the passion of love or hatred towards the actors 'twill be necessary to shew wherein consists the pleasure or uneasiness of many objects which we find by experience to produce these passions  ACCORDING to the preceding system there is always requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas betwixt the cause and effect in order to produce either love or hatred But tho' this be universally true 'tis remarkable that the passion of love may be excited by only one  relation  of a different kind  viz  betwixt ourselves and the object or more properly speaking that this relation is always attended with both the others Whoever is united to us by any connexion is always sure of a share of our love proportion'd to the connexion without enquiring into his other qualities Thus  the relation of blood produces the strongest tie the mind is capable of in the love of parents to their children and a lesser degree of the same affection as the relation lessens Nor has consanguinity alone this effect but any other relation without exception We love our countrymen our neighbours those of the same trade profession and even name with ourselves Every one of these relations is esteem'd some tie and gives a title to a share of our affection  THERE is another phaenomenon which is parallel to this  viz  that  acquaintance  without any kind of relation gives rise to love and kindness When we have contracted a habitude and intimacy with any person tho' in frequenting his company we have not been able to discover any very valuable quality of which he is possess'd yet we cannot forbear preferring him to strangers of whose superior merit we are fully convinc'd These two phaenomena of the effects of relation and acquaintance will give mutual light to each other and may be both explain'd from the same principle  THOSE who take a pleasure in declaiming against human nature have observ'd that man is altogether insufficient to support himself and that when you loosen all the  holds which he has of external objects he immediately drops down into the deepest melancholy and despair From this say they proceeds that continual search after amusement in gaming in hunting in business by which we endeavour to forget ourselves and excite our spirits from the languide state into which they fall when not sustain'd by some brisk and lively emotion To this method of thinking I so far agree that I own the mind to be insufficient of itself to its own entertainment and that it naturally seeks after foreign objects which may produce a lively sensation and agitate the spirits On the appearance of such an object it awakes as it were from a dream The blood flows with a new tide The heart is elevated And the whole man acquires a vigour which he cannot command in his solitary and calm moments Hence company is naturally so rejoicing as presenting the liveliest of all objects  viz  a rational and thinking Being like ourselves who communicates to us all the actions of his mind makes us privy to his inmost sentiments and affections and lets us see in the very instant of their production all the emotions which are caus'd by any object Every lively idea is agreeable but especially  that of a passion because such an idea becomes a kind of passion and gives a more sensible agitation to the mind than any other image or conception  THIS being once admitted all the rest is easy For as the company of strangers is agreeable to us for  a short time  by inlivening our thought so the company of our relations and acquaintance must be peculiarly agreeable because it has this effect in a greater degree and is of more  durable  influence Whatever is related to us is conceiv'd in a lively manner by the easy transition from ourselves to the related object Custom also or acquaintance facilitates the entrance and strengthens the conception of any object The first case is parallel to our reasonings from cause and effect the second to education And as reasoning and education concur only in producing a lively and strong idea of any object so is this the only particular which is common to relation and acquaintance This must therefore be the influencing quality by which they produce all their common effects and love or kindness being one of these effects it must be from the force and liveliness of conception that the passion is deriv'd Such a conception is peculiarly agreeable and  makes us have an affectionate regard for every thing that produces it when the proper object of kindness and goodwill  'TIS obvious that people associate together according to their particular tempers and dispositions and that men of gay tempers naturally love the gay as the serious bear an affection to the serious This not only happens where they remark this resemblance betwixt themselves and others but also by the natural course of the disposition and by a certain sympathy which always arises betwixt similar characters Where they remark the resemblance it operates after the manner of a relation by producing a connexion of ideas Where they do not remark it it operates by some other principle and if this latter principle be similar to the former it must be receiv'd as a confirmation of the foregoing reasoning  THE idea of ourselves is always intimately present to us and conveys a sensible degree of vivacity to the idea of any other object to which we are related This lively idea changes by degrees into a real impression these two kinds of perception being in a great measure the same and differing only in their degrees of force and vivacity But this change must be produc'd  with the greater ease that our natural temper gives us a propensity to the same impression which we observe in others and makes it arise upon any slight occasion In that case resemblance converts the idea into an impression not only by means of the relation and by transfusing the original vivacity into the related idea but also by presenting such materials as take fire from the least spark And as in both cases a love or affection arises from the resemblance we may learn that a sympathy with others is agreeable only by giving an emotion to the spirits since an easy sympathy and correspondent emotions are alone common to  relation acquaintance  and  resemblance  THE great propensity men have to pride may be consider'd as another similar phaenomenon It often happens that after we have liv'd a considerable time in any city however at first it might be disagreeable to us yet as we become familiar with the objects and contract an acquaintance tho' merely with the streets and buildings the aversion diminishes by degrees and at last changes into the opposite passion The mind finds a satisfaction and ease in the view of objects to which it is accustom'd and naturally prefers them to others which  tho' perhaps in themselves more valuable are less known to it By the same quality of the mind we are seduc'd into a good opinion of ourselves and of all objects that belong to us They appear in a stronger light are more agreeable and consequently fitter subjects of pride and vanity than any other  IT may not be amiss in treating of the affection we bear our acquaintance and relations to observe some pretty curious phaenomena which attend it 'Tis easy to remark in common life that children esteem their relation to their mother to be weaken'd in a great measure by her second marriage and no longer regard her with the same eye as if she had continu'd in her state of widowhood Nor does this happen only when they have felt any inconveniencies from her second marriage or when her husband is much her inferior but even without any of these considerations and merely because she has become part of another family This also takes place with regard to the second marriage of a father but in a much less degree And 'tis certain the ties of blood are not so much loosen'd in the latter case as by the marriage of a mother These two phaenomena are remarkable  in themselves but much more so when compar'd  IN order to produce a perfect relation betwixt two objects 'tis requisite not only that the imagination be convey'd from one to the other by resemblance contiguity or causation but also that it return back from the second to the first with the same ease and facility At first sight this may seem a necessary and unavoidable consequence If one object resemble another the latter object must necessarily resemble the former If one object be the cause of another the second object is effect to its cause 'Tis the same case with contiguity And therefore the relation being always reciprocal it may be thought that the return of the imagination from the second to the first must also in every case be equally natural as its passage from the first to the second But upon farther examination we shall easily discover our mistake For supposing the second object beside its reciprocal relation to the first to have also a strong relation to a third object in that case the thought passing from the first object to the second returns not back with the same facility tho' the relation continues the same but is readily carry'd on to the third object by means  of the new relation which presents itself and gives a new impulse to the imagination This new relation therefore weakens the tie betwixt the first and second objects The fancy is by its very nature wavering and inconstant and considers always two objects as more strongly related together where it finds the passage equally easy both in going and returning than where the transition is easy only in one of these motions The double motion is a kind of a double tie and binds the objects together in the closest and most intimate manner  THE second marriage of a mother breaks not the relation of child and parent and that relation suffices to convey my imagination from myself to her with the greatest ease and facility But after the imagination is arriv'd at this point of view it finds its object to be surrounded with so many other relations which challenge its regard that it knows not which to prefer and is at a loss what new object to pitch upon The ties of interest and duty bind her to another family and prevent that return of the fancy from her to myself which is necessary to support the union The thought has no longer the vibration requisite to set it perfectly  at ease and indulge its inclination to change It goes with facility but returns with difficulty and by that interruption finds the relation much weaken'd from what it wou'd be were the passage open and easy on both sides  NOW to give a reason why this effect follows not in the same degree upon the second marriage of a father we may reflect on what has been prov'd already that tho' the imagination goes easily from the view of a lesser object to that of a greater yet it returns not with the same facility from the greater to the less When my imagination goes from myself to my father it passes not so readily from him to his second wife nor considers him as entering into a different family but as continuing the head of that family of which I am myself a part His superiority prevents the easy transition of the thought from him to his spouse but keeps the passage still open for a return to myself along the same relation of child and parent He is not sunk in the new relation he acquires so that the double motion or vibration of thought is still easy and natural By this indulgence of the fancy in its inconstancy the tie of child and parent still preserves its full force and influence  A MOTHER thinks not her tie to a son weaken'd because 'tis shar'd with her husband Nor a son his with a parent because 'tis shar'd with a brother The third object is here related to the first as well as to the second so that the imagination goes and comes along all of them with the greatest facility  SECT V  Of our esteem for the rich and powerful  NOTHING has a greater tendency to give us an esteem for any person than his power and riches or a contempt than his poverty and meanness And as esteem and contempt are to be consider'd as species of love and hatred 'twill be proper in this place to explain these phaenomena  HERE it happens most fortunately that the greatest difficulty is not to discover a principle capable of producing such an effect but to choose the chief and predominant among several that present themselves The  satisfaction  we take in the riches of others  and the  esteem  we have for the possessors may be ascrib'd to three different causes  First  To the objects they possess such as houses gardens equipages which being agreeable in themselves necessarily produce a sentiment of pleasure in every one that either considers or surveys them  Secondly  To the expectation of advantage from the rich and powerful by our sharing their possessions  Thirdly  To sympathy which makes us partake of the satisfaction of every one that approaches us All these principles may concur in producing the present phaenomenon The question is to which of them we ought principally to ascribe it  'TIS certain that the first principle  viz  the reflection on agreeable objects has a greater influence than what at first sight we may be apt to imagine We seldom reflect on what is beautiful or ugly agreeable or disagreeable without an emotion of pleasure or uneasiness and tho' these sensations appear not much in our common indolent way of thinking 'tis easy either in reading or conversation to discover them Men of wit always turn the discourse on subjects that are entertaining to the imagination and poets never present any objects but such as are of the same nature Mr  Philips  has chosen  Cyder  for the subject of an excellent poem Beer wou'd not have been so proper as being neither so agreeable to the taste nor eye But he wou'd certainly have preferr'd wine to either of them cou'd his native country have afforded him so ageeeable a liquor We may learn from thence that every thing which is agreeable to the senses is also in some measure agreeable to the fancy and conveys to the thought an image of that satisfaction which it gives by its real application to the bodily organs  BUT tho' these reasons may induce us to comprehend this delicacy of the imagination among the causes of the respect which we pay the rich and powerful there are many other reasons that may keep us from regarding it as the sole or principal For as the ideas of pleasure can have an influence only by means of their vivacity which makes them approach impressions 'tis most natural those ideas shou'd have that influence which are favour'd by most circumstances and have a natural tendency to become strong and lively such as our ideas of the passions and sensations of any human creature Every human creature resembles ourselves and by that means has an advantage above any other object in operating on the imagination  BESIDES if we consider the nature of that faculty and the great influence which all relations have upon it we shall easily be perswaded that however the ideas of the pleasant wines music or gardens which the rich man enjoys may become lively and agreeable the fancy will not confine itself to them but will carry its view to the related objects and in particular to the person who possesses them And this is the more natural that the pleasant idea or image produces here a passion towards the person by means of his relation to the object so that 'tis unavoidable but he must enter into the original conception since he makes the object of the derivative passion But if he enters into the original conception and is consider'd as enjoying these agreeable objects 'tis  sympathy  which is properly the cause of the affection and the  third  principle is more powerful and universal than the  first  ADD to this that riches and power alone even tho' unemploy'd naturally cause esteem and respect And consequently these passions arise not from the idea of any beautiful or agreeable objects 'Tis true money implies a kind of representation of such objects by the power it affords of obtaining them and for that reason may still be esteem'd proper to convey those agreeable  images which may give rise to the passion But as this prospect is very distant 'tis more natural for us to take a contiguous object  viz  the satisfaction which this power affords the person who is possest of it And of this we shall be farther satisfy'd if we consider that riches represent the goods of life only by means of the will which employs them and therefore imply in their very nature an idea of the person and cannot be consider'd without a kind of sympathy with his sensations and enjoyments  THIS we may confirm by a reflection which to some will perhaps appear too subtile and refin'd I have already observ'd that power as distinguish'd from its exercise has either no meaning at all or is nothing but a possibility or probability of existence by which any object approaches to reality and has a sensible influence on the mind I have also observ'd that this approach by an illusion of the fancy appears much greater when we ourselves are possest of the power than when it is enjoy'd by another and that in the former case the objects seem to touch upon the very verge of reality and convey almost an equal satisfaction as if actually in our possession Now I assert that where we esteem a person upon account of his riches we must  enter into this sentiment of the proprietor and that without such a sympathy the idea of the agreeable objects which they give him the power to produce wou'd have but a feeble influence upon us An avaritious man is respected for his money tho' he scarce is possest of a  power  that is there scarce is a  probability  or even  possibility  of his employing it in the acquisition of the pleasures and conveniences of life To himself alone this power seems perfect and entire and therefore we must receive his sentiments by sympathy before we can have a strong intense idea of these enjoyments or esteem him upon account of them  THUS we have found that the  first  principle  viz the agreeable idea of those objects which riches afford the enjoyment of  resolves itself in a great measure into the  third  and becomes a  sympathy  with the person we esteem or love Let us now examine the  second  principle  viz the agreeable expectation of advantage  and see what force we may justly attribute to it  'TIS obvious that tho' riches and authority undoubtedly give their owner a power of doing us service yet this power is not to be consider'd as on the same footing with that which they afford him of  pleasing himself and satisfying his own appetites Selflove approaches the power and exercise very near each other in the latter case but in order to produce a similar effect in the former we must suppose a friendship and goodwill to be conjoin'd with the riches Without that circumstance 'tis difficult to conceive on what we can found our hope of advantage from the riches of others tho' there is nothing more certain than that we naturally esteem and respect the rich even before we discover in them any such favourable disposition towards us  BUT I carry this farther and observe not only that we respect the rich and powerful where they shew no inclination to serve us but also when we lie so much out of the sphere of their activity that they cannot even be suppos'd to be endow'd with that power Prisoners of war are always treated with a respect suitable to their condition and 'tis certain riches go very far towards fixing the condition of any person If birth and quality enter for a share this still affords us an argument of the same kind For what is it we call a man of birth but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons  whom we esteem His ancestors therefore tho' dead are respected in some measure on account of their riches and consequently without any kind of expectation  BUT not to go so far as prisoners of war and the dead to find instances of this disinterested esteem for riches let us observe with a little attention those phaenomena that occur to us in common life and conversation A man who is himself of a competent fortune upon coming into a company of strangers naturally treats them with different degrees of respect and deference as he is inform'd of their different fortunes and conditions tho' 'tis impossible he can ever propose and perhaps wou'd not accept of any advantage from them A traveller is always admitted into company and meets with civility in proportion as his train and equipage speak him a man of great or moderate fortune In short the different ranks of men are in a great measure regulated by riches and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors strangers as well as acquaintance  THERE is indeed an answer to these arguments drawn from the influence of  general rules  It may be pretended that being accustom'd to expect succour and protection  from the rich and powerful and to esteem them upon that account we extend the same sentiments to those who resemble them in their fortune but from whom we can never hope for any advantage The general rule still prevails and by giving a bent to the imagination draws along the passion in the same manner as if its proper object were real and existent  BUT that this principle does not here take place will easily appear if we consider that in order to establish a general rule and extend it beyond its proper bounds there is requir'd a certain uniformity in our experience and a great superiority of those instances which are conformable to the rule above the contrary But here the case is quite otherwise Of a hundred men of credit and fortune I meet with there is not perhaps one from whom I can expect advantage so that 'tis impossible any custom can ever prevail in the present case  UPON THE WHOLE there remains nothing which can give us an esteem for power and riches and a contempt for meanness and poverty except the principle of  sympathy  by which we enter into the sentiments of the rich and poor and partake of their pleasure and uneasiness Riches  give satisfaction to their possessor and this satisfaction is convey'd to the beholder by the imagination which produces an idea resembling the original impression in force and vivacity This agreeable idea or impression is connected with love which is an agreeable passion It proceeds from a thinking conscious being which is the very object of love From this relation of impressions and identity of ideas the passion arises according to my hypothesis  THE best method of reconciling us to this opinion is to take a general survey of the universe and observe the force of sympathy thro' the whole animal creation and the easy communication of sentiments from one thinking being to another In all creatures that prey not upon others and are not agitated with violent passions there appears a remarkable desire of company which associates them together without any advantages they can ever propose to reap from their union This is still more conspicuous in man as being the creature of the universe who has the most ardent desire of society and is fitted for it by the most advantages We can form no wish which has not a reference to society A perfect solitude is perhaps the greatest punishment  we can suffer Every pleasure languishes when enjoy'd apart from company and every pain becomes more cruel and intolerable Whatever other passions we may be actuated by pride ambition avarice curiosity revenge or lust the soul or animating principle of them all is sympathy nor wou'd they have any force were we to abstract entirely from the thoughts and sentiments of others Let all the powers and elements of nature conspire to serve and obey one man Let the sun rise and set at his command The sea and rivers roll as he pleases and the earth furnish spontaneously whatever may be useful or agreeable to him He will still be miserable till you give him some one person at least with whom he may share his happiness and whose esteem and friendship he may enjoy  THIS conclusion from a general view of human nature we may confirm by particular instances wherein the force of sympathy is very remarkable Most kinds of beauty are deriv'd from this origin and tho' our first object be some senseless inanimate piece of matter 'tis seldom we rest there and carry not our view to its influence on sensible and rational creatures A man who shews us any house or building takes particular  care among other things to point out the convenience of the apartments the advantages of their situation and the little room lost in the stairs antichambers and passages and indeed 'tis evident the chief part of the beauty consists in these particulars The observation of convenience gives pleasure since convenience is a beauty But after what manner does it give pleasure 'Tis certain our own interest is not in the least concern'd and as this is a beauty of interest not of form so to speak it must delight us merely by communication and by our sympathizing with the proprietor of the lodging We enter into his interest by the force of imagination and feel the same satisfaction that the objects naturally occasion in him  THIS observation extends to tables chairs scritoires chimneys coaches sadles ploughs and indeed to every work of art it being an universal rule that their beauty is chiefly deriv'd from their utility and from their fitness for that purpose to which they are destin'd But this is an advantage that concerns only the owner nor is there any thing but sympathy which can interest the spectator  'TIS evident that nothing renders a field more agreeable than its fertility and that scarce any advantages of ornament or situation will be able to equal this beauty 'Tis the same case with particular trees and plants as with the field on which they grow I know not but a plain overgrown with furze and broom may be in itself as beautiful as a hill cover'd with vines or olivetrees tho' it will never appear so to one who is acquainted with the value of each But this is a beauty merely of imagination and has no foundation in what appears to the senses Fertility and value have a plain reference to use and that to riches joy and plenty in which tho' we have no hope of partaking yet we enter into them by the vivacity of the fancy and share them in some measure with the proprietor  THERE is no rule in painting more reasonable than that of ballancing the figures and placing them with the greatest exactness on their proper center of gravity A figure which is not justly ballanc'd is disagreeable and that because it conveys the ideas of its fall of harm and of pain Which ideas are painful when by sympathy  they acquire any degree of force and vivacity  ADD to this that the principal part of personal beauty is an air of health and vigour and such a construction of members as promises strength and activity This idea of beauty cannot be accounted for but by sympathy  IN general we may remark that the minds of men are mirrors to one another not only because they reflect each others emotions but also because those rays of passions sentiments and opinions may be often reverberated and may decay away by insensible degrees Thus the pleasure which a rich man receives from his possessions being thrown upon the beholder causes a pleasure and esteem which sentiments again being perceiv'd and sympathiz'd with encrease the pleasure of the possessor and being once more reflected become a new foundation for pleasure and esteem in the beholder There is certainly an original satisfaction in riches deriv'd from that power which they bestow of enjoying all the pleasures of life and as this is their very nature and essence it must be the first source of all the passions which arise from them One of the most considerable of these passions is that of  love or esteem in others which therefore proceeds from a sympathy with the pleasure of the possessor But the possessor has also a secondary satisfaction in riches arising from the love and esteem he acquires by them and this satisfaction is nothing but a second reflexion of that original pleasure which proceeded from himself This secondary satisfaction or vanity becomes one of the principal recommendations of riches and is the chief reason why we either desire them for ourselves or esteem them in others Here then is a third rebound of the original pleasure after which 'tis difficult to distinguish the images and reflexions by reason of their faintness and confusion  SECT VI  Of benevolence and anger  IDEAS may be compar'd to the extension and solidity of matter and impressions especially reflective ones to colours tastes smells and other sensible qualities Ideas never admit of a total union but are endow'd with a kind of impenetrability by which they exclude each other and are capable  of forming a compound by their conjunction not by their mixture On the other hand impressions and passions are susceptible of an entire union and like colours may be blended so perfectly together that each of them may lose itself and contribute only to vary that uniform impression which arises from the whole Some of the most curious phaenomena of the human mind are deriv'd from this property of the passions  IN examining those ingredients which are capable of uniting with love and hatred I begin to be sensible in some measure of a misfortune that has attended every system of philosophy with which the world has been yet acquainted 'Tis commonly found that in accounting for the operations of nature by any particular hypothesis among a number of experiments that quadrate exactly with the principles we wou'd endeavour to establish there is always some phaenomenon which is more stubborn and will not so easily bend to our purpose We need not be surpriz'd that this shou'd happen in natural philosophy The essence and composition of external bodies are so obscure that we must necessarily in our reasonings or rather conjectures concerning  them involve ourselves in contradictions and absurdities But as the perceptions of the mind are perfectly known and I have us'd all imaginable caution in forming conclusions concerning them I have always hop'd to keep clear of those contradictions which have attended every other system Accordingly the difficulty which I have at present in my eye is nowise contrary to my system but only departs a little from that simplicity which has been hitherto its principal force and beauty  THE passions of love and hatred are always follow'd by or rather conjoin'd with benevolence and anger 'Tis this conjunction which chiefly distinguishes these affections from pride and humility For pride and humility are pure emotions in the soul unattended with any desire and not immediately exciting us to action But love and hatred are not compleated within themselves nor rest in that emotion which they produce but carry the mind to something farther Love is always follow'd by a desire of the happiness of the person belov'd and an aversion to his misery As hatred produces a desire of the misery and an aversion to the happiness of the person hated So remarkable a difference betwixt these two  sets of passions of pride and humility love and hatred which in so many other particulars correspond to each other merits our attention  THE conjunction of this desire and aversion with love and hatred may be accounted for by two different hypotheses The first is that love and hatred have not only a  cause  which excites them  viz  pleasure and pain and an  object  to which they are directed  viz  a person or thinking being but likewise an  end  which they endeavour to attain  viz  the happiness or misery of the person belov'd or hated all which views mixing together make only one passion According to this system love is nothing but the desire of happiness to another person and hatred that of misery The desire and aversion constitute the very nature of love and hatred They are not only inseparable but the same  BUT this is evidently contrary to experience For tho' 'tis certain we never love any person without desiring his happiness nor hate any without wishing his misery yet these desires arise only upon the ideas of the happiness or misery of our friend or enemy being presented by the imagination  and are not absolutely essential to love and hatred They are the most obvious and natural sentiments of these affections but not the only ones The passions may express themselves in a hundred ways and may subsist a considerable time without our reflecting on the happiness or misery of their objects which clearly proves that these desires are not the same with love and hatred nor make any essential part of them  WE may therefore infer that benevolence and anger are passions different from love and hatred and only conjoin'd with them by the original constitution of the mind As nature has given to the body certain appetites and inclinations which she encreases diminishes or changes according to the situation of the fluids or solids she has proceeded in the same manner with the mind According as we are possess'd with love or hatred the correspondent desire of the happiness or misery of the person who is the object of these passions arises in the mind and varies with each variation of these opposite passions This order of things abstractedly consider'd is not necessary Love and hatred might have been unattended with any such desires or  their particular connexion might have been entirely revers'd If nature had so pleas'd love might have had the same effect as hatred and hatred as love I see no contradiction in supposing a desire of producing misery annex'd to love and of happiness to hatred If the sensation of the passion and desire be opposite nature cou'd have alter'd the sensation without altering the tendency of the desire and by that means made them compatible with each other  SECT VII  Of compassion  BUT tho' the desire of the happiness or misery of others according to the love or hatred we bear them be an arbitrary and original instinct implanted in our nature we find it may be counterfeited on many occasions and may arise from secondary principles  Pity  is a concern for and  malice  a joy in the misery of others without any friendship or enmity to occasion this concern or joy We pity even strangers and such as are perfectly indifferent to us And if our illwill to another proceed  from any harm or injury it is not properly speaking malice but revenge But if we examine these affections of pity and malice we shall find them to be secondary ones arising from original affections which are varied by some particular turn of thought and imagination  'TWILL be easy to explain the passion of  pity  from the precedent reasoning concerning  sympathy  We have a lively idea of every thing related to us All human creatures are related to us by resemblance Their persons therefore their interests their passions their pains and pleasures must strike upon us in a lively manner and produce an emotion similar to the original one since a lively idea is easily converted into an impression If this be true in general it must be more so of affliction and sorrow These have always a stronger and more lasting influence than any pleasure or enjoyment  A SPECTATOR of a tragedy passes thro' a long train of grief terror indignation and other affections which the poet represents in the persons he introduces As many tragedies end happily and no excellent one can be compos'd without some reverses  of fortune the spectator must sympathize with all these changes and receive the fictitious joy as well as every other passion Unless therefore it be asserted that every distinct passion is communicated by a distinct original quality and is not deriv'd from the general principle of sympathy aboveexplain'd it must be allow'd that all of them arise from that principle To except any one in particular must appear highly unreasonable As they are all first present in the mind of one person and afterwards appear in the mind of another and as the manner of their appearance first as an idea then as an impression is in every case the same the transition must arise from the same principle I am at least sure that this method of reasoning wou'd be consider'd as certain either in natural philosophy or common life  ADD to this that pity depends in a great measure on the contiguity and even sight of the object which is a proof that 'tis deriv'd from the imagination Not to mention that women and children are most subject to pity as being most guided by that faculty The same infirmity which makes them faint at the sight of a naked  sword tho' in the hands of their best friend makes them pity extremely those whom they find in any grief or affliction Those philosophers who derive this passion from I know not what subtile reflections on the instability of fortune and our being liable to the same miseries we behold will find this observation contrary to them among a great many others which it were easy to produce  THERE remains only to take notice of a pretty remarkable phaenomenon of this passion which is that the communicated passion of sympathy sometimes acquires strength from the weakness of its original and even arises by a transition from affections which have no existence Thus when a person obtains any honourable office or inherits a great fortune we are always the more rejoic'd for his prosperity the less sense he seems to have of it and the greater equanimity and indifference he shews in its enjoyment In like manner a man who is not dejected by misfortunes is the more lamented on account of his patience and if that virtue extends so far as utterly to remove all sense of uneasiness it still farther encreases our compassion When a person of merit  falls into what is vulgarly esteem'd a great misfortune we form a notion of his condition and carrying our fancy from the cause to the usual effect first conceive a lively idea of his sorrow and then feel an impression of it entirely overlooking that greatness of mind which elevates him above such emotions or only considering it so far as to encrease our admiration love and tenderness for him We find from experience that such a degree of passion is usually connected with such a misfortune and tho' there be an exception in the present case yet the imagination is affected by the  general rule  and makes us conceive a lively idea of the passion or rather feel the passion itself in the same manner as if the person were really actuated by it From the same principles we blush for the conduct of those who behave themselves foolishly before us and that tho' they shew no sense of shame nor seem in the least conscious of their folly All this proceeds from sympathy but 'tis of a partial kind and views its objects only on one side without considering the other which has a contrary effect and wou'd entirely destroy that emotion which arises from the first appearance  WE have also instances wherein an indifference and insensibility under misfortune encreases our concern for the misfortunate even tho' the indifference proceed not from any virtue and magnanimity 'Tis an aggravation of a murder that it was committed upon persons asleep and in perfect security as historians readily observe of any infant prince who is captive in the hands of his enemies that he is more worthy of compassion the less sensible he is of his miserable condition As we ourselves are here acquainted with the wretched situation of the person it gives us a lively idea and sensation of sorrow which is the passion that  generally  attends it and this idea becomes still more lively and the sensation more violent by a contrast with that security and indifference which we observe in the person himself A contrast of any kind never fails to affect the imagination especially when presented by the subject and 'tis on the imagination that pity entirely depends  To prevent all ambiguity I must observe that where I oppose the imagination to the memory I mean in general the faculty that presents our fainter ideas In all other places and particularly when it is oppos'd to the understanding I understand the same faculty excluding only our demonstrative and probable reasonings    SECT VIII  Of malice and envy  WE must now proceed to account for the passion of  malice  which imitates the effects of hatred as pity does those of love and gives us a joy in the sufferings and miseries of others without any offence or injury on their part  So little are men govern'd by reason in their sentiments and opinions that they always judge more of objects by comparison than from their intrinsic worth and value When the mind considers or is accustom'd to any degree of perfection whatever falls short of it tho' really esteemable has notwithstanding the same effect upon the passions as what is defective and ill This is an  original  quality of the soul and similar to what we have every day experience of in our bodies Let a man heat one hand and cool the other the same water will at the same time seem both hot and cold according to the disposition of the different organs A small degree of any quality succeeding a greater produces the same sensation  as if less than it really is and even sometimes as the opposite quality Any gentle pain that follows a violent one seems as nothing or rather becomes a pleasure as on the other hand a violent pain succeeding a gentle one is doubly grievous and uneasy  THIS no one can doubt of with regard to our passions and sensations But there may arise some difficulty with regard to our ideas and objects When an object augments or diminishes to the eye or imagination from a comparison with others the image and idea of the object are still the same and are equally extended in the  retina  and in the brain or organ of perception The eyes refract the rays of light and the optic nerves convey the images to the brain in the very same manner whether a great or small object has preceded nor does even the imagination alter the dimensions of its object on account of a comparison with others The question then is how from the same impression and the same idea we can form such different judgments concerning the same object and at one time admire its bulk and at another despise its littleness This variation in our judgments  must certainly proceed from a variation in some perception but as the variation lies not in the immediate impression or idea of the object it must lie in some other impression that accompanies it  IN order to explain this matter I shall just touch upon two principles one of which shall be more fully explain'd in the progress of this treatise the other has been already accounted for I believe it may safely be establish'd for a general maxim that no object is presented to the senses nor image form'd in the fancy but what is accompany'd with some emotion or movement of spirits proportion'd to it and however custom may make us insensible of this sensation and cause us to confound it with the object or idea 'twill be easy by careful and exact experiments to separate and distinguish them For to instance only in the cases of extension and number 'tis evident that any very bulky object such as the ocean an extended plain a vast chain of mountains a wide forest or any very numerous collection of objects such as an army a fleet a crowd excite in the mind a sensible emotion and that the admiration which arises on the appearance of such objects  is one of the most lively pleasures which human nature is capable of enjoying Now as this admiration encreases or diminishes by the encrease or diminution of the objects we may conclude according to our foregoing  Book I Part III Sect  principles that 'tis a compound effect proceeding from the conjunction of the several effects which arise from each part of the cause Every part then of extension and every unite of number has a separate emotion attending it when conceiv'd by the mind and tho' that emotion be not always agreeable yet by its conjunction with others and by its agitating the spirits to a just pitch it contributes to the production of admiration which is always agreeable If this be allow'd with respect to extension and number we can make no difficulty with respect to virtue and vice wit and folly riches and poverty happiness and misery and other objects of that kind which are always attended with an evident emotion  THE second principle I shall take notice of is that of our adherence to  general rules  which has such a mighty influence on the actions and understanding and is able to  impose on the very senses When an object is found by experience to be always accompany'd with another whenever the first object appears tho' chang'd in very material circumstances we naturally fly to the conception of the second and form an idea of it in as lively and strong a manner as if we had infer'd its existence by the justest and most authentic conclusion of our understanding Nothing can undeceive us not even our senses which instead of correcting this false judgment are often perverted by it and seem to authorize its errors  THE conclusion I draw from these two principles join'd to the influence of comparison abovemention'd is very short and decisive Every object is attended with some emotion proportion'd to it a great object with a great emotion a small object with a small emotion A great  object  therefore succeeding a small one makes a great  emotion  succeed a small one Now a great emotion succeeding a small one becomes still greater and rises beyond its ordinary proportion But as there is a certain degree of an emotion which commonly attends every magnitude of an object when the emotion  encreases we naturally imagine that the object has likewise encreas'd The effect conveys our view to its usual cause a certain degree of emotion to a certain magnitude of the object nor do we consider that comparison may change the emotion without changing any thing in the object Those who are acquainted with the metaphysical part of optics and know how we transfer the judgments and conclusions of the understanding to the senses will easily conceive this whole operation  BUT leaving this new discovery of an impression that secretly attends every idea we must at least allow of that principle from whence the discovery arose  that objects appear greater or less by a comparison with others  We have so many instances of this that it is impossible we can dispute its veracity and 'tis from this principle I derive the passions of malice and envy  'TIS evident we must receive a greater or less satisfaction or uneasiness from reflecting on our own condition and circumstances in proportion as they appear more or less fortunate or unhappy in proportion to the degrees of riches and power and merit and reputation which we think ourselves possest  of Now as we seldom judge of objects from their intrinsic value but form our notions of them from a comparison with other objects it follows that according as we observe a greater or less share of happipiness or misery in others we must make an estimate of our own and feel a consequent pain or pleasure The misery of another gives us a more lively idea of our happiness and his happiness of our misery The former therefore produces delight and the latter uneasiness  HERE then is a kind of pity reverst or contrary sensations arising in the beholder from those which are felt by the person whom he considers In general we may observe that in all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another to which it is compar'd a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey A small object makes a great one appear still greater A great object makes a little one appear less Deformity of itself produces uneasiness but makes us receive new pleasure by its contrast with a beautiful object whose beauty is augmented by it as on the other hand beauty which of itself produces pleasure makes us receive  a new pain by the contrast with any thing ugly whose deformity it augments The case therefore must be the same with happiness and misery The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure and therefore produces pain when compar'd with our own His pain consider'd in itself is painful to us but augments the idea of our own happiness and gives us pleasure  NOR will it appear strange that we may feel a reverst sensation from the happiness and misery of others since we find the same comparison may give us a kind of malice against ourselves and make us rejoice for our pains and grieve for our pleasures Thus the prospect of past pain is agreeable when we are satisfy'd with our present condition as on the other hand our past pleasures give us uneasiness when we enjoy nothing at present equal to them The comparison being the same as when we reflect on the sentiments of others must be attended with the same effects  NAY a person may extend this malice against himself even to his present fortune and carry it so far as designedly to seek affliction and encrease his pains and sorrows  This may happen upon two occasions  First  Upon the distress and misfortune of a friend or person dear to him  Secondly  Upon the feeling any remorses for a crime of which he has been guilty 'Tis from the principle of comparison that both these irregular appetites for evil arise A person who indulges himself in any pleasure while his friend lies under affliction feels the reflected uneasiness from his friend more sensibly by a comparison with the original pleasure which he himself enjoys This contrast indeed ought also to inliven the present pleasure But as grief is here suppos'd to be the predominant passion every addition falls to that side and is swallow'd up in it without operating in the least upon the contrary affection 'Tis the same case with those penances which men inflict on themselves for their past sins and failings When a criminal reflects on the punishment he deserves the idea of it is magnify'd by a comparison with his present ease and satisfaction which forces him in a manner to seek uneasiness in order to avoid so disagreeable a contrast  THIS reasoning will account for the origin of  envy  as well as of malice The only  difference betwixt these passions lies in this that envy is excited by some present enjoyment of another which by comparison diminishes our idea of our own Whereas malice is the unprovok'd desire of producing evil to another in order to reap a pleasure from the comparison The enjoyment which is the object of envy is commonly superior to our own A superiority naturally seems to overshade us and presents a disagreeable comparison But even in the case of an inferiority we still desire a greater distance in order to augment still more the idea of ourself When this distance diminishes the comparison is less to our advantage and consequently gives us less pleasure and is even disagreeable Hence arises that species of envy which men feel when they perceive their inferiors approaching or overtaking them in the pursuit of glory or happiness In this envy we may see the effects of comparison twice repeated A man who compares himself to his inferior receives a pleasure from the comparison And when the inferiority decreases by the elevation of the inferior what shou'd only have been a decrease of pleasure becomes a real pain by a new comparison with its preceding condition  'TIS worthy of observation concerning that envy which arises from a superiority in others that 'tis not the great disproportion betwixt ourself and another which produces it but on the contrary our proximity A common soldier bears no such envy to his general as to his sergeant or corporal nor does an eminent writer meet with so great jealousy in common hackney scriblers as in authors that more nearly approach him It may indeed be thought that the greater the disproportion is the greater must be the uneasiness from the comparison But we may consider on the other hand that the great disproportion cuts off the relation and either keeps us from comparing ourselves with what is remote from us or diminishes the effects of the comparison Resemblance and proximity always produce a relation of ideas and where you destroy these ties however other accidents may bring two ideas together as they have no bond or connecting quality to join them in the imagination 'tis impossible they can remain long united or have any considerable influence on each other  I HAVE observ'd in considering the nature of ambition that the great feel a double  pleasure in authority from the comparison of their own condition with that of their slaves and that this comparison has a double influence because 'tis natural and presented by the subject When the fancy in the comparison of objects passes not easily from the one object to the other the action of the mind is in a great measure broke and the fancy in considering the second object begins as it were upon a new footing The impression which attends every object seems not greater in that case by succeeding a less of the same kind but these two impressions are distinct and produce their distinct effects without any communication together The want of relation in the ideas breaks the relation of the impressions and by such a separation prevents their mutual operation and influence  To confirm this we may observe that the proximity in the degree of merit is not alone sufficient to give rise to envy but must be assisted by other relations A poet is not apt to envy a philosopher or a poet of a different kind of a different nation or of a different age All these differences prevent or weaken the comparison and consequently the passion  THIS too is the reason why all objects appear great or little merely by a comparison with those of the same species A mountain neither magnifies nor diminishes a horse in our eyes but when a  Flemish  and a  Welsh  horse are seen together the one appears greater and the other less than when view'd apart  FROM the same principle we may account for that remark of historians that any party in a civil war always choose to call in a foreign enemy at any hazard rather than submit to their fellowcitizens  Guicciardin  applies this remark to the wars in  Italy  where the relations betwixt the different states are properly speaking nothing but of name language and contiguity Yet even these relations when join'd with superiority by making the comparison more natural make it likewise more grievous and cause men to search for some other superiority which may be attended with no relation and by that means may have a less sensible influence on the imagination The mind quickly perceives its several advantages and disadvantages and finding its situation to be most uneasy where superiority is conjoin'd with other relations seeks its  repose as much as possible by their separation and by breaking that association of ideas which renders the comparison so much more natural and efficacious When it cannot break the association it feels a stronger desire to remove the superiority and this is the reason why travellers are commonly so lavish of their praises to the  Chinese  and  Persians  at the same time that they depreciate those neighbouring nations which may stand upon a foot of rivalship with their native country  THESE examples from history and common experience are rich and curious but we may find parallel ones in the arts which are no less remarkable Shou'd an author compose a treatise of which one part was serious and profound another light and humorous every one wou'd condemn so strange a mixture and wou'd accuse him of the neglect of all rules of art and criticism These rules of art are founded on the qualities of human nature and the quality of human nature which requires a consistency in every performance is that which renders the mind incapable of passing in a moment from one passion and disposition to a quite different one Yet this makes us  not blame Mr  Prior  for joining his  Alma  and his  Solomon  in the same volume tho' that admirable poet has succeeded perfectly well in the gaiety of the one as well as in the melancholy of the other Even supposing the reader shou'd peruse these two compositions without any interval he wou'd feel little or no difficulty in the change of passions Why but because he considers these performances as entirely different and by this break in the ideas breaks the progress of the affections and hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the other  AN heroic and burlesque design united in one picture wou'd be monstrous tho' we place two pictures of so opposite a character in the same chamber and even close by each other without any scruple or difficulty  IN a word no ideas can affect each other either by comparison or by the passions they separately produce unless they be united together by some relation which may cause an easy transition of the ideas and consequently of the emotions or impressions attending the ideas and may preserve the one impression in the passage of the imagination to the object of the other This principle is very remarkable because it is  analogous to what we have observ'd both concerning the  understanding  and the  passions  Suppose two objects to be presented to me which are not connected by any kind of relation Suppose that each of these objects separately produces a passion and that these two passions are in themselves contrary We find from experience that the want of relation in the objects or ideas hinders the natural contrariety of the passions and that the break in the transition of the thought removes the affections from each other and prevents their opposition 'Tis the same case with comparison and from both these phaenomena we may safely conclude that the relation of ideas must forward the transition of impressions since its absence alone is able to prevent it and to separate what naturally shou'd have operated upon each other When the absence of an object or quality removes any usual or natural effect we may certainly conclude that its presence contributes to the production of the effect  SECT IX  Of the mixture of benevolence and anger with compassion and malice  THUS we have endeavour'd to account for  pity  and  malice  Both these affections arise from the imagination according to the light in which it places its object When our fancy considers directly the sentiments of others and enters deep into them it makes us sensible of all the passions it surveys but in a particular manner of grief or sorrow On the contrary when we compare the sentiments of others to our own we feel a sensation directly opposite to the original one  viz  a joy from the grief of others and a grief from their joy But these are only the first foundations of the affections of pity and malice Other passions are afterwards confounded with them There is always a mixture of love or tenderness with pity and of hatred or anger with malice But it must be confess'd that this mixture seems at first sight to be contradictory to my system For as  pity is an uneasiness and malice a joy arising from the misery of others pity shou'd naturally as in all other cases produce hatred and malice love This contradiction I endeavour to reconcile after the following manner  IN order to cause a transition of passions there is requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas nor is one relation sufficient to produce this effect But that we may understand the full force of this double relation we must consider that 'tis not the present sensation alone or momentary pain or pleasure which determines the character of any passion but the whole bent or tendency of it from the beginning to the end One impression may be related to another not only when their sensations are resembling as we have all along suppos'd in the preceding cases but also when their impulses or directions are similar and correspondent This cannot take place with regard to pride and humility because these are only pure sensations without any direction or tendency to action We are therefore to look for instances of this peculiar relation of impressions only in such affections as are attended with a certain appetite  or desire such as those of love and hatred  BENEVOLENCE or the appetite which attends love is a desire of the happiness of the person belov'd and an aversion to his misery as anger or the appetite which attends hatred is a desire of the misery of the person hated and an aversion to his happiness A desire therefore of the happiness of another and aversion to his misery are similar to benevolence and a desire of his misery and aversion to his happiness are correspondent to anger Now pity is a desire of happiness to another and aversion to his misery as malice is the contrary appetite Pity then is related to benevolence and malice to anger And as benevolence has been already found to be connected with love by a natural and original quality and anger with hatred 'tis by this chain the passions of pity and malice are connected with love and hatred  THIS hypothesis is founded on sufficient experience A man who from any motives has entertain'd a resolution of performing an action naturally runs into every other view or motive which may fortify that resolution and give it authority and  influence on the mind To confirm us in any design we search for motives drawn from interest from honour from duty What wonder then that pity and benevolence malice and anger being the same desires arising from different principles shou'd so totally mix together as to be undistinguishable As to the connexion betwixt benevolence and love anger and hatred being  original  and primary it admits of no difficulty  WE may add to this another experiment  viz  that benevolence and anger and consequently love and hatred arise when our happiness or misery have any dependance on the happiness or misery of another person without any farther relation I doubt not but this experiment will appear so singular as to excuse us for stopping a moment to consider it  SUPPOSE that two persons of the same trade shou'd seek employment in a town that is not able to maintain both 'tis plain the success of one is perfectly incompatible with that of the other and that whatever is for the interest of either is contrary to that of his rival and so  vice versa  Suppose again that two merchants tho' living  in different parts of the world shou'd enter into copartnership together the advantage or loss of one becomes immediately the advantage or loss of his partner and the same fortune necessarily attends both Now 'tis evident that in the first case hatred always follows upon the contrariety of interests as in the second love arises from their union Let us consider to what principle we can ascribe these passions  'TIS plain they arise not from the double relations of impressions and ideas if we regard only the present sensation For takeing the first case of rivalship tho' the pleasure and advantage of an antagonist necessarily causes my pain and loss yet to counterballance this his pain and loss causes my pleasure and advantage and supposing him to be unsuccessful I may by this means receive from him a superior degree of satisfaction In the same manner the success of a partner rejoices me but then his misfortunes afflict me in an equal proportion and 'tis easy to imagine that the latter sentiment may in many cases preponderate But whether the fortune of a rival or partner be good or bad I always hate the former and love the latter  THIS love of a partner cannot proceed from the relation or connexion betwixt us in the same manner as I love a brother or countryman A rival has almost as close a relation to me as a partner For as the pleasure of the latter causes my pleasure and his pain my pain so the pleasure of the former causes my pain and his pain my pleasure The connexion then of cause and effect is the same in both cases and if in the one case the cause and effect has a farther relation of resemblance they have that of contrariety in the other which being also a species of resemblance leaves the matter pretty equal  THE only explication then we can give of this phaenomenon is deriv'd from that principle of a parallel direction abovemention'd Our concern for our own interest gives us a pleasure in the pleasure and a pain in the pain of a partner after the same manner as by sympathy we feel a sensation correspondent to those which appear in any person who is present with us On the other hand the same concern for our interest makes us feel a pain in the pleasure and a pleasure in the pain of a rival and in short the same contrariety of  sentiments as arises from comparison and malice Since therefore a parallel direction of the affections proceeding from interest can give rise to benevolence or anger no wonder the same parallel direction deriv'd from sympathy and from comparison shou'd have the same effect  IN general we may observe that 'tis impossible to do good to others from whatever motive without feeling some touches of kindness and goodwill towards 'em as the injuries we do not only cause hatred in the person who suffers them but even in ourselves These phaenomena indeed may in part be accounted for from other principles  BUT here there occurs a considerable objection which 'twill be necessary to examine before we proceed any farther I have endeavour'd to prove that power and riches or poverty and meanness which give rise to love or hatred without producing any original pleasure or uneasiness operate upon us by means of a secondary sensation deriv'd from a sympathy with that pain or satisfaction which they produce in the person who possesses them From a sympathy with his pleasure there arises love from that with his uneasiness hatred But 'tis  a maxim which I have just now establish'd and which is absolutely necessary to the explication of the phaenomena of pity and malice  That 'tis not the present sensation or momentary pain or pleasure which determines the character of any passion but the general bent or tendency of it from the beginning to the end  For this reason pity or a sympathy with pain produces love and that because it interests us in the fortunes of others good or bad and gives us a secondary sensation correspondent to the primary in which it has the same influence with love and benevolence Since then this rule holds good in one case why does it not prevail throughout and why does sympathy in uneasiness ever produce any passion beside goodwill and kindness Is it becoming a philosopher to alter his method of reasoning and run from one principle to its contrary according to the particular phaenomenon which he wou'd explain  I HAVE mention'd two different causes from which a transition of passion may arise  viz  a double relation of ideas and impressions and what is similar to it a conformity in the tendency and direction of any  two desires which arise from different principles Now I assert that when a sympathy with uneasiness is weak it produces hatred or contempt by the former cause when strong it produces love or tenderness by the latter This is the solution of the foregoing difficulty which seems so urgent and this is a principle founded on such evident arguments that we ought to have establish'd it even tho' it were not necessary to the explication of any phaenomenon  'TIS certain that sympathy is not always limited to the present moment but that we often feel by communication the pains and pleasures of others which are not in being and which we only anticipate by the force of imagination For supposing I saw a person perfectly unknown to me who while asleep in the fields was in danger of being trod under foot by horses I shou'd immediately run to his assistance and in this I shou'd be actuated by the same principle of sympathy which makes me concern'd for the present sorrows of a stranger The bare mention of this is sufficient Sympathy being nothing but a lively idea converted into an impression 'tis  evident that in considering the future possible or probable condition of any person we may enter into it with so vivid a conception as to make it our own concern and by that means be sensible of pains and pleasures which neither belong to ourselves nor at the present instant have any real existence  BUT however we may look forward to the future in sympathizing with any person the extending of our sympathy depends in a great measure upon our sense of his present condition 'Tis a great effort of imagination to form such lively ideas even of the present sentiments of others as to feel these very sentiments but 'tis impossible we cou'd extend this sympathy to the future without being aided by some circumstance in the present which strikes upon us in a lively manner When the present misery of another has any strong influence upon me the vivacity of the conception is not confin'd merely to its immediate object but diffuses its influence over all the related ideas and gives me a lively notion of all the circumstances of that person whether past present or future possible probable or certain By means of this lively notion I  am interested in them take part with them and feel a sympathetic motion in my breast conformable to whatever I imagine in his If I diminish the vivacity of the first conception I diminish that of the related ideas as pipes can convey no more water than what arises at the fountain By this diminution I destroy the future prospect which is necessary to interest me perfectly in the fortune of another I may feel the present impression but carry my sympathy no farther and never transfuse the force of the first conception into my ideas of the related objects If it be another's misery which is presented in this feeble manner I receive it by communication and am affected with all the passions related to it But as I am not so much interested as to concern myself in his good fortune as well as his bad I never feel the extensive sympathy nor the passions related to  it  NOW in order to know what passions are related to these different kinds of sympathy we must consider that benevolence is an original pleasure arising from the pleasure of the person belov'd and a pain proceeding from his pain From which correspondence of impressions there arises a subsequent desire  of his pleasure and aversion to his pain In order then to make a passion run parallel with benevolence 'tis requisite we shou'd feel these double impressions correspondent to those of the person whom we consider nor is any one of them alone sufficient for that purpose When we sympathize only with one impression and that a painful one this sympathy is related to anger and to hatred upon account of the uneasiness it conveys to us But as the extensive or limited sympathy depends upon the force of the first sympathy it follows that the passion of love or hatred depends upon the same principle A strong impression when communicated gives a double tendency of the passions which is related to benevolence and love by a similarity of direction however painful the first impression might have been A weak impression that is painful is related to anger and hatred by the resemblance of sensations Benevolence therefore arises from a great degree of misery or any degree strongly sympathiz'd with Hatred or contempt from a small degree or one weakly sympathiz'd with which is the principle I intended to prove and explain  NOR have we only our reason to trust to for this principle but also experience A certain degree of poverty produces contempt but a degree beyond causes compassion and goodwill We may undervalue a peasant or servant but when the misery of a beggar appears very great or is painted in very lively colours we sympathize with him in his afflictions and feel in our heart evident touches of pity and benevolence The same object causes contrary passions according to its different degrees The passions therefore must depend upon principles that operate in such certain degrees according to my hypothesis The encrease of the sympathy has evidently the same effect as the encrease of the misery  A BARREN or desolate country always seems ugly and disagreeable and commonly inspires us with contempt for the inhabitants This deformity however proceeds in a great measure from a sympathy with the inhabitants as has been already observ'd but it is only a weak one and reaches no farther than the immediate sensation which is disagreeable The view of a city in ashes conveys benevolent sentiments because we there enter so deep into the interests  of the miserable inhabitants as to wish for their prosperity as well as feel their adversity  BUT tho' the force of the impression generally produces pity and benevolence 'tis certain that by being carry'd too far it ceases to have that effect This perhaps may be worth our notice When the uneasiness is either small in itself or remote from us it engages not the imagination nor is able to convey an equal concern for the future and contingent good as for the present and real evil Upon its acquiring greater force we become so interested in the concerns of the person as to be sensible both of his good and bad fortune and from that compleat sympathy there arises pity and benevolence But 'twill easily be imagin'd that where the present evil strikes with more than ordinary force it may entirely engage our attention and prevent that double sympathy abovemention'd Thus we find that tho' every one but especially women are apt to contract a kindness for criminals who go to the scaffold and readily imagine them to be uncommonly handsome and wellshap'd yet one who is present at the cruel execution of the  rack feels no such tender emotions but is in a manner overcome with horror and has no leisure to temper this uneasy sensation by any opposite sympathy  BUT the instance which makes the most clearly for my hypothesis is that wherein by a change of the objects we separate the double sympathy even from a midling degree of the passion in which case we find that pity instead of producing love and tenderness as usual always gives rise to the contrary affection When we observe a person in misfortunes we are affected with pity and love but the author of that misfortune becomes the object of our strongest hatred and is the more detested in proportion to the degree of our compassion Now for what reason shou'd the same passion of pity produce love to the person who suffers the misfortune and hatred to the person who causes it unless it be because in the latter case the author bears a relation only to the misfortune whereas in considering the sufferer we carry our view on every side and wish for his prosperity as well as are sensible of his affliction  I SHALL just observe before I leave the present subject that this phaenomenon of the double sympathy and its tendency to cause love may contribute to the production of the kindness which we naturally bear our relations and acquaintance Custom and relation make us enter deeply into the sentiments of others and whatever fortune we suppose to attend them is render'd present to us by the imagination and operates as if originally our own We rejoice in their pleasures and grieve for their sorrows merely from the force of sympathy Nothing that concerns them is indifferent to us and as this correspondence of sentiments is the natural attendant of love it readily produces that affection  SECT X  Of respect and contempt  THERE now remains only to explain the passions of  respect  and  contempt  along with the  amorous  affection in order to understand all the passions which have any mixture of love or hatred Let us begin with respect and contempt  IN considering the qualities and circumstances of others we may either regard them as they really are in themselves or may make a comparison betwixt them and our own qualities and circumstances or may join these two methods of consideration The good qualities of others from the first point of view produce love from the second humility and from the third respect which is a mixture of these two passions Their bad qualities after the same manner cause either hatred or pride or contempt according to the light in which we survey them  THAT there is a mixture of pride in contempt and of humility in respect is I think  too evident from their very feeling or appearance to require any particular proof That this mixture arises from a tacit comparison of the person contemn'd or respected with ourselves is no less evident The same man may cause either respect love or contempt by his condition and talents according as the person who considers him from his inferior becomes his equal or superior In changing the point of view tho' the object may remain the same its proportion to ourselves entirely alters which is the cause of an alteration in the passions These passions therefore arise from our observing the proportion that is from a comparison  I HAVE already observ'd that the mind has a much stronger propensity to pride than to humility and have endeavour'd from the principles of human nature to assign a cause for this phaenomenon Whether my reasoning be receiv'd or not the phaenomenon is undisputed and appears in many instances Among the rest 'tis the reason why there is a much greater mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in respect and why we are more elevated with the view of one below us than mortify'd with the presence of one above us Contempt  or scorn has so strong a tincture of pride that there scarce is any other passion discernable Whereas in esteem or respect love makes a more considerable ingredient than humility The passion of vanity is so prompt that it rouzes at the least call while humility requires a stronger impulse to make it exert itself  BUT here it may reasonably be ask'd why this mixture takes place only in some cases and appears not on every occasion All those objects which cause love when plac'd on another person are the causes of pride when transfer'd to ourselves and consequently ought to be causes of humility as well as love while they belong to others and are only compar'd to those which we ourselves possess In like manner every quality which by being directly consider'd produces hatred ought always to give rise to pride by comparison and by a mixture of these passions of hatred and pride ought to excite contempt or scorn The difficulty then is why any objects ever cause pure love or hatred and produce not always the mixt passions of respect and contempt  I HAVE suppos'd all along that the passions of love and pride and those of humility  and hatred are similar in their sensations and that the two former are always agreeable and the two latter painful But tho' this be universally true 'tis observable that the two agreeable as well as the two painful passions have some differences and even contrarieties which distinguish them Nothing invigorates and exalts the mind equally with pride and vanity tho' at the same time love or tenderness is rather found to weaken and infeeble it The same difference is observable betwixt the uneasy passions Anger and hatred bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions while humility and shame deject and discourage us Of these qualities of the passions 'twill be necessary to form a distinct idea Let us remember that pride and hatred invigorate the soul and love and humility infeeble it  FROM this it follows that tho' the conformity betwixt love and hatred in the agreeableness of their sensation makes them always be excited by the same objects yet this other contrariety is the reason why they are excited in very different degrees Genius and learning are  pleasant  and  magnificent  objects and by both these circumstances  are adapted to pride and vanity but have a relation to love by their pleasure only Ignorance and simplicity are  disagreeable  and  mean  which in the same manner gives them a double connexion with humility and a single one with hatred We may therefore consider it as certain that tho' the same object always produces love and pride humility and hatred according to its different situations yet it seldom produces either the two former or the two latter passions in the same proportion  'TIS here we must seek for a solution of the difficulty abovemention'd why any object ever excites pure love or hatred and does not always produce respect or contempt by a mixture of humility or pride No quality in another gives rise to humility by comparison unless it wou'd have produc'd pride by being plac'd in ourselves and  vice versa  no object excites pride by comparison unless it wou'd have produc'd humility by the direct survey This is evident objects always produce by  comparison  a sensation directly contrary to their  original  one Suppose therefore an object to be presented which is peculiarly fitted to produce love but imperfectly to excite pride  this object belonging to another gives rise directly to a great degree of love but to a small one of humility by comparison and consequently that latter passion is scarce felt in the compound nor is able to convert the love into respect This is the case with good nature good humour facility generosity beauty and many other qualities These have a peculiar aptitude to produce love in others but not so great a tendency to excite pride in ourselves For which reason the view of them as belonging to another person produces pure love with but a small mixture of humility and respect 'Tis easy to extend the same reasoning to the opposite passions  BEFORE we leave this subject it may not be amiss to account for a pretty curious phaenomenon  viz  why we commonly keep at a distance such as we contemn and allow not our inferiors to approach too near even in place and situation It has already been observ'd that almost every kind of idea is attended with some emotion even the ideas of number and extension much more those of such objects as are esteem'd of consequence in life and fix our attention 'Tis not with entire indifference we can survey  either a rich man or a poor one but must feel some faint touches at least of respect in the former case and of contempt in the latter These two passions are contrary to each other but in order to make this contrariety be felt the objects must be someway related otherwise the affections are totally separate and distinct and never encounter The relation takes place wherever the persons become contiguous which is a general reason why we are uneasy at seeing such disproportion'd objects as a rich man and a poor one a nobleman and a porter in that situation  THIS uneasiness which is common to every spectator must be more sensible to the superior and that because the near approach of the inferior is regarded as a piece of illbreeding and shews that he is not sensible of the disproportion and is no way affected by it A sense of superiority in another breeds in all men an inclination to keep themselves at a distance from him and determines them to redouble the marks of respect and reverence when they are oblig'd to approach him and where they do not observe that conduct 'tis a proof they are not sensible of his superiority From hence  too it proceeds that any great  difference  in the degrees of any quality is call'd a  distance  by a common metaphor which however trivial it may appear is founded on natural principles of the imagination A great difference inclines us to produce a distance The ideas of distance and difference are therefore connected together Connected ideas are readily taken for each other and this is in general the source of the metaphor as we shall have occasion to observe afterwards  SECT XI  Of the amorous passion or love betwixt the sexes  OF all the compound passions which proceed from a mixture of love and hatred with other affections no one better deserves our attention than that love which arises betwixt the sexes as well on account of its force and violence as those curious principles of philosophy for which it affords us an uncontestable argument 'Tis plain that this affection in its most natural  state is deriv'd from the conjunction of three different impressions or passions  viz  The pleasing sensation arising from beauty the bodily appetite for generation and a generous kindness or goodwill The origin of kindness from beauty may be explain'd from the foregoing reasoning The question is how the bodily appetite is excited by it  THE appetite of generation when confin'd to a certain degree is evidently of the pleasant kind and has a strong connexion with all the agreeable emotions Joy mirth vanity and kindness are all incentives to this desire as well as music dancing wine and good cheer On the other hand sorrow melancholy poverty humility are destructive of it From this quality 'tis easily conceiv'd why it shou'd be connected with the sense of beauty  BUT there is another principle that contributes to the same effect I have observ'd that the parallel direction of the desires is a real relation and no less than a resemblance in their sensation produces a connexion among them That we may fully comprehend the extent of this relation we must consider that any principal desire may be  attended with subordinate ones which are connected with it and to which if other desires are parallel they are by that means related to the principal one Thus hunger may oft be consider'd as the primary inclination of the soul and the desire of approaching the meat as the secondary one since 'tis absolutely necessary to the satisfying that appetite If an object therefore by any separate qualities inclines us to approach the meat it naturally encreases our appetite as on the contrary whatever inclines us to set our victuals at a distance is contradictory to hunger and diminishes our inclination to them Now 'tis plain that beauty has the first effect and deformity the second Which is the reason why the former gives us a keener appetite for our victuals and the latter is sufficient to disgust us at the most savoury dish that cookery has invented All this is easily applicable to the appetite for generation  FROM these two relations  viz  resemblance and a parallel desire there arises such a connexion betwixt the sense of beauty the bodily appetite and benevolence that they become in a manner inseparable And we find from experience that 'tis indifferent  which of them advances first since any of them is almost sure to be attended with the related affections One who is inflam'd with lust feels at least a momentary kindness towards the object of it and at the same time fancies her more beautiful than ordinary as there are many who begin with kindness and esteem for the wit and merit of the person and advance from that to the other passions But the most common species of love is that which first arises from beauty and afterwards diffuses itself into kindness and into the bodily appetite Kindness or esteem and the appetite to generation are too remote to unite easily together The one is perhaps the most refin'd passion of the soul the other the most gross and vulgar The love of beauty is plac'd in a just medium betwixt them and partakes of both their natures From whence it proceeds that 'tis so singularly fitted to produce both  THIS account of love is not peculiar to my system but is unavoidable on any hypothesis The three affections which compose this passion are evidently distinct and has each of them its distinct object 'Tis certain therefore that 'tis only by their relation  they produce each other But the relation of passions is not alone sufficient 'Tis likewise necessary there shou'd be a relation of ideas The beauty of one person never inspires us with love for another This then is a sensible proof of the double relation of impressions and ideas From one instance so evident as this we may form a judgment of the rest  THIS may also serve in another view to illustrate what I have insisted on concerning the origin of pride and humility love and hatred I have observ'd that tho' self be the object of the first set of passions and some other person of the second yet these objects cannot alone be the causes of the passions as having each of them a relation to two contrary affections which must from the very first moment destroy each other Here then is the situation of the mind as I have already describ'd it It has certain organs naturally fitted to produce a passion that passion when produc'd naturally turns the view to a certain object But this not being sufficient to produce the passion there is requir'd some other emotion which by a double relation of impressions and ideas may set these principles in action and bestow  on them their first impulse This situation is still more remarkable with regard to the appetite of generation Sex is not only the object but also the cause of the appetite We not only turn our view to it when actuated by that appetite but the reflecting on it suffices to excite the appetite But as this cause loses its force by too great frequency 'tis necessary it shou'd be quicken'd by some new impulse and that impulse we find to arise from the  beauty  of the  person  that is from a double relation of impressions and ideas Since this double relation is necessary where an affection has both a distinct cause and object how much more so where it has only a distinct object without any determinate cause  SECT XII  Of the love and hatred of animals  BUT to pass from the passions of love and hatred and from their mixtures and compositions as they appear in man to the same affections as they display themselves  in brutes we may observe not only that love and hatred are common to the whole sensitive creation but likewise that their causes as aboveexplain'd are of so simple a nature that they may easily be suppos'd to operate on mere animals There is no force of reflection or penetration requir'd Every thing is conducted by springs and principles which are not peculiar to man or any one species of animals The conclusion from this is obvious in favour of the foregoing system  LOVE in animals has not for its only object animals of the same species but extends itself farther and comprehends almost every sensible and thinking being A dog naturally loves a man above his own species and very commonly meets with a return of affection  AS animals are but little susceptible either of the pleasures or pains of the imagination they can judge of objects only by the sensible good or evil which they produce and from  that  must regulate their affections towards them Accordingly we find that by benefits or injuries we produce their love or hatred and that by feeding and cherishing any animal we quickly acquire  his affections as by beating and abusing him we never fail to draw on us his enmity and illwill  LOVE in beasts is not caus'd so much by relation as in our species and that because their thoughts are not so active as to trace relations except in very obvious instances Yet 'tis easy to remark that on some occasions it has a considerable influence upon them Thus acquaintance which has the same effect as relation always produces love in animals either to men or to each other For the same reason any likeness among them is the source of affection An ox confin'd to a park with horses will naturally join their company if I may so speak but always leaves it to enjoy that of his own species where he has the choice of both  THE affection of parents to their young proceeds from a peculiar instinct in animals as well as in our species  'TIS evident that  sympathy  or the communication of passions takes place among animals no less than among men Fear anger courage and other affections are frequently communicated from one animal to another without their knowledge of that  cause which produc'd the original passion Grief likewise is receiv'd by sympathy and produces almost all the same consequences and excites the same emotions as in our species The howlings and lamentations of a dog produce a sensible concern in his fellows And 'tis remarkable that tho' almost all animals use in play the same member and nearly the same action as in fighting a lion a tyger a cat their paws an ox his horns a dog his teeth a horse his heels Yet they most carefully avoid harming their companion even tho' they have nothing to fear from his resentment which is an evident proof of the sense brutes have of each other's pain and pleasure  EVERY one has observ'd how much more dogs are animated when they hunt in a pack than when they pursue their game apart and 'tis evident this can proceed from nothing but from sympathy 'Tis also well known to hunters that this effect follows in a greater degree and even in too great a degree where two packs that are strangers to each other are join'd together We might perhaps be at a loss to explain this phaenomenon if we  had not experience of a similar in ourselves  ENVY and malice are passions very remarkable in animals They are perhaps more common than pity as requiring less effort of thought and imagination  PART III  Of the will and direct passions  SECT I  Of liberty and necessity  _WE come now to explain the  direct  passions or the impressions which arise immediately from good or evil from pain or pleasure Of this kind are  desire and aversion grief and joy hope and fear  OF all the immediate effects of pain and pleasure there is none more remarkable than the WILL and tho' properly speaking it be not comprehended among the passions yet as the full understanding of  its nature and properties is necessary to the explanation of them we shall here make it the subject of our enquiry I desire it may be observ'd that by the  will  I mean nothing but  the internal impression we feel and are conscious of when we knowingly give rise to any new motion of our body or new preception of our mind  This impression like the preceding ones of pride and humility love and hatred 'tis impossible to define and needless to describe any farther for which reason we shall cut off all those definitions and distinctions with which philosophers are wont to perplex rather than clear up this question and entering at first upon the subject shall examine that long disputed question concerning  liberty and necessity  which occurs so naturally in treating of the will  'TIS universally acknowledg'd that the operations of external bodies are necessary and that in the communication of their motion in their attraction and mutual cohesion there are not the least traces of indifference or liberty Every object is determin'd by an absolute fate to a certain degree and direction of its motion and can no more depart from that precise line in which  it moves than it can convert itself into an angel or spirit or any superior substance The actions therefore of matter are to be regarded as instances of necessary actions and whatever is in this respect on the same footing with matter must be acknowledg'd to be necessary That we may know whether this be the case with the actions of the mind we shall begin with examining matter and considering on what the idea of a necessity in its operations are founded and why we conclude one body or action to be the infallible cause of another  IT has been observ'd already that in no single instance the ultimate connexion of any objects is discoverable either by our senses or reason and that we can never penetrate so far into the essence and construction of bodies as to perceive the principle on which their mutual influence depends 'Tis their constant union alone with which we are acquainted and 'tis from the constant union the necessity arises If objects had not an uniform and regular conjunction with each other we shou'd never arrive at any idea of cause and effect and even after all the necessity which enters into that idea is nothing but a determination  of the mind to pass from one object to its usual attendant and infer the existence of one from that of the other Here then are two particulars which we are to consider as essential to necessity  viz  the constant  union  and the  inference  of the mind and wherever we discover these we must acknowledge a necessity As the actions of matter have no necessity but what is deriv'd from these circumstances and it is not by any insight into the essence of bodies we discover their connexion the absence of this insight while the union and inference remain will never in any case remove the necessity 'Tis the observation of the union which produces the inference for which reason it might be thought sufficient if we prove a constant union in the actions of the mind in order to establish the inference along with the necessity of these actions But that I may bestow a greater force on my reasoning I shall examine these particulars apart and shall first prove from experience that our actions have a constant union with our motives tempers and circumstances before I consider the inferences we draw from it  To this end a very slight and general view of the common course of human affairs will be sufficient There is no light in which we can take them that does not confirm this principle Whether we consider mankind according to the difference of sexes ages governments conditions or methods of education the same uniformity and regular operation of natural principles are discernible Like causes still produce like effects in the same manner as in the mutual action of the elements and powers of nature  THERE are different trees which regularly produce fruit whose relish is different from each other and this regularity will be admitted as an instance of necessity and causes in external bodies But are the products of  Guienne  and of  Champagne  more regularly different than the sentiments actions and passions of the two sexes of which the one are distinguish'd by their force and maturity the other by their delicacy and softness  ARE the changes of our body from infancy to old age more regular and certain than those of our mind and conduct And wou'd a man be more ridiculous who  wou'd expect that an infant of four years old will raise a weight of three hundred pound than one who from a person of the same age wou'd look for a philosophical reasoning or a prudent and wellconcerted action  WE must certainly allow that the cohesion of the parts of matter arises from natural and necessary principles whatever difficulty we may find in explaining them And for a like reason we must allow that human society is founded on like principles and our reason in the latter case is better than even that in the former because we not only observe that men  always  seek society but can also explain the principles on which this universal propensity is founded For is it more certain that two flat pieces of marble will unite together than that two young savages of different sexes will copulate Do the children arise from this copulation more uniformly than does the parents care for their safety and preservation And after they have arriv'd at years of discretion by the care of their parents are the inconveniencies attending their separation more certain than their foresight of these  inconveniencies and their care of avoiding them by a close union and confederacy  THE skin pores muscles and nerves of a daylabourer are different from those of a man of quality So are his sentiments actions and manners The different stations of life influence the whole fabric external and internal and these different stations arise necessarily because uniformly from the necessary and uniform principles of human nature Men cannot live without society and cannot be associated without government Government makes a distinction of property and establishes the different ranks of men This produces industry traffic manufactures lawsuits war leagues alliances voyages travels cities fleets ports and all those other actions and objects which cause such a diversity and at the same time maintain such an uniformity in human life  SHOU'D a traveller returning from a far country tell us that he had seen a climate in the fiftieth degree of northern latitude where all the fruits ripen and come to perfection in the winter and decay in the summer after the same manner as in  England  they are produc'd and decay in the  contrary seasons he wou'd find few so credulous as to believe him I am apt to think a travellar wou'd meet with as little credit who shou'd inform us of people exactly of the same character with those in  Plato  's republic on the one hand or those in  Hobbes  's  Leviathan  on the other There is a general course of nature in human actions as well as in the operations of the sun and the climate There are also characters peculiar to different nations and particular persons as well as common to mankind The knowledge of these characters is founded on the observation of an uniformity in the actions that flow from them and this uniformity forms the very essence of necessity  I CAN imagine only one way of eluding this argument which is by denying that uniformity of human actions on which it is founded As long as actions have a constant union and connexion with the situation and temper of the agent however we may in words refuse to acknowledge the necessity we really allow the thing Now some may perhaps find a pretext to deny this regular union and connexion For what is more capricious than human actions  What more inconstant than the desires of man And what creature departs more widely not only from right reason but from his own character and disposition An hour a moment is sufficient to make him change from one extreme to another and overturn what cost the greatest pain and labour to establish Necessity is regular and certain Human conduct is irregular and uncertain The one therefore proceeds not from the other  TO this I reply that in judging of the actions of men we must proceed upon the same maxims as when we reason concerning external objects When any phaenomena are constantly and invariably conjoin'd together they acquire such a connexion in the imagination that it passes from one to the other without any doubt or hesitation But below this there are many inferior degrees of evidence and probability nor does one single contrariety of experiment entirely destroy all our reasoning The mind ballances the contrary experiments and deducting the inferior from the superior proceeds with that degree of assurance or evidence which remains Even when these contrary experiments are entirely equal we remove not  the notion of causes and necessity but supposing that the usual contrariety proceeds from the operation of contrary and conceal'd causes we conclude that the chance or indifference lies only in our judgment on account of our imperfect knowledge not in the things themselves which are in every case equally necessary tho' to appearance not equally constant or certain No union can be more constant and certain than that of some actions with some motives and characters and if in other cases the union is uncertain 'tis no more than what happens in the operations of body nor can we conclude any thing from the one irregularity which will not follow equally from the other  'TIS commonly allow'd that madmen have no liberty But were we to judge by their actions these have less regularity and constancy than the actions of wisemen and consequently are farther remov'd from necessity One way of thinking in this particular is therefore absolutely inconsistent but is a natural consequence of these confus'd ideas and undefin'd terms which we so commonly make use of in  our reasonings especially on the present subject  WE must now shew that as the  union  betwixt motives and actions has the same constancy as that in any natural operations so its influence on the understanding is also the same in  determining  us to infer the existence of one from that of another If this shall appear there is no known circumstance that enters into the connexion and production of the actions of matter that is not to be found in all the operations of the mind and consequently we cannot without a manifest absurdity attribute necessity to the one and refuse it to the other  THERE is no philosopher whose judgment is so riveted to this fantastical system of liberty as not to acknowledge the force of  moral evidence  and both in speculation and proceed upon it as upon a reasonable foundation Now moral evidence is nothing but a conclusion concerning the actions of men deriv'd from the consideration of their motives temper and situation Thus when we see certain characters or figures describ'd upon paper we infer that the person who produc'd them wou'd affirm such facts the death of  Caesar  the success of  Augustus  the cruelty of  Nero  and remembring many other concurrent testimonies we conclude that those facts were once really existent and that so many men without any interest wou'd never conspire to deceive us especially since they must in the attempt expose themselves to the derision of all their contemporaries when these facts were asserted to be recent and universally known The same kind of reasoning runs thro' politics war commerce oeconomy and indeed mixes itself so entirely in human life that 'tis impossible to act or subsist a moment without having recourse to it A prince who imposes a tax upon his subjects expects their compliance A general who conducts an army makes account of a certain degree of courage A merchant looks for fidelity and skill in his factor or supercargo A man who gives orders for his dinner doubts not of the obedience of his servants In short as nothing more nearly interests us than our own actions and those of others the greatest part of our reasonings is employ'd in judgments concerning them Now I assert that whoever reasons after this manner does  ipso facto  believe the actions of the will to arise from  necessity and that he knows not what he means when he denies it  ALL those objects of which we call the one  cause  and the other  effect  consider'd in themselves are as distinct and separate from each other as any two things in nature nor can we ever by the most accurate survey of them infer the existence of the one from that of the other 'Tis only from experience and the observation of their constant union that we are able to form this inference and even after all the inference is nothing but the effects of custom on the imagination We must not here be content with saying that the idea of cause and effect arises from objects constantly united but must affirm that 'tis the very same with the idea of these objects and that the  necessary connexion  is not discover'd by a conclusion of the understanding but is merely a perception of the mind Wherever therefore we observe the same union and wherever the union operates in the same manner upon the belief and opinion we have the idea of causes and necessity tho' perhaps we may avoid those expressions Motion in one body in all past instances that have fallen under our observation is  follow'd upon impulse by motion in another 'Tis impossible for the mind to penetrate farther From this constant union it  forms  the idea of cause and effect and by its influence  feels  the necessity As there is the same constancy and the same influence in what we call moral evidence I ask no more What remains can only be a dispute of words  AND indeed when we consider how aptly  natural  and  moral  evidence cement together and form only one chain of argument betwixt them we shall make no scruple to allow that they are of the same nature and deriv'd from the same principles A prisoner who has neither money nor interest discovers the impossibility of his escape as well from the obstinacy of the goaler as from the walls and bars with which he is surrounded and in all attempts for his freedom chuses rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one than upon the inflexible nature of the other The same prisoner when conducted to the scaffold foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards as from the operation of the ax or wheel His mind runs along a certain train of  ideas The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape the action of the executioner the separation of the head and body bleeding convulsive motions and death Here is a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions but the mind feels no difference betwixt them in passing from one link to another nor is less certain of the future event than if it were connected with the present impressions of the memory and senses by a train of causes cemented together by what we are pleas'd to call a  physical necessity  The same experienc'd union has the same effect on the mind whether the united objects be motives volitions and actions or figure and motion We may change the names of things but their nature and their operation on the understanding never change  I DARE be positive no one will ever endeavour to refute these reasouings otherwise than by altering my definitions and assigning a different meaning to the terms of  cause and effect and necessity and liberty and chance  According to my definitions necessity makes an essential part of causation and consequently liberty by removing necessity removes also causes and is the very same  thing with chance As chance is commonly thought to imply a contradiction and is at least directly contrary to experience there are always the same arguments against liberty or freewill If any one alters the definitions I cannot pretend to argue with him 'till I know the meaning he assigns to these terms  SECT II  The same subject continu'd  I BELIEVE we may assign the three following reasons for the prevalence of the doctrine of liberty however absurd it may be in one sense and unintelligible in any other First After we have perform'd any action tho' we confess we were influenc'd by particular views and motives 'tis difficult for us to perswade ourselves we were govern'd by necessity and that 'twas utterly impossible for us to have acted otherwise the idea of necessity seeming to imply something of force and violence and constraint of which we are not sensible Few are capable of distinguishing betwixt the liberty of  spontaniety  as it is call'd in  the schools and the liberty of  indifference  betwixt that which is oppos'd to violence and that which means a negation of necessity and causes The first is even the most common sense of the word and as 'tis only that species of liberty which it concerns us to preserve our thoughts have been principally turn'd towards it and have almost universally confounded it with the other  SECONDLY There is a  false sensation or experience  even of the liberty of indifference which is regarded as an argument for its real existence The necessity of any action whether of matter or of the mind is not properly a quality in the agent but in any thinking or intelligent being who may consider the action and consists in the determination of his thought to infer its existence from some preceding objects As liberty or chance on the other hand is nothing but the want of that determination and a certain looseness which we feel in passing or not passing from the idea of one to that of the other Now we may observe that tho' in reflecting on human actions we seldom feel such a looseness or indifference yet it very commonly happens that in performing the actions themselves we are sensible  of something like it And as all related or resembling objects are readily taken for each other this has been employ'd as a demonstrative or even an intuitive proof of human liberty We feel that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing because when by a denial of it we are provok'd to try we feel that it moves easily every way and produces an image of itself even on that side on which it did not settle This image or faint motion we perswade ourselves cou'd have been compleated into the thing itself because shou'd that be deny'd we find upon a second trial that it can But these efforts are all in vain and whatever capricious and irregular actions we may perform as the desire of showing our liberty is the sole motive of our actions we can never free ourselves from the bonds of necessity We may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves but a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character and even where he cannot he concludes in general that he might were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and temper and the most  secret springs of our complexion and disposition Now this is the very essence of necessity according to the foregoing doctrine  A THIRD reason why the doctrine of liberty has generally been better receiv'd in the world than its antagonist proceeds from  religion  which has been very unnecessarily interested in this question There is no method of reasoning more common and yet none more blameable than in philosophical debates to endeavour to refute any hypothesis by a pretext of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality When any opinion leads us into absurdities 'tis certainly false but 'tis not certain an opinion is false because 'tis of dangerous consequence Such topics therefore ought entirely to be foreborn as serving nothing to the discovery of truth but only to make the person of an antagonist odious This I observe in general without pretending to draw any advantage from it I submit myself frankly to an examination of this kind and dare venture to affirm that the doctrine of necessity according to my explication of it is not only innocent but even advantageous to religion and morality  I DEFINE necessity two ways conformable to the two definitions of  cause  of which it makes an essential part I place it either in the constant union and conjunction of like objects or in the inference of the mind from the one to the other Now necessity in both these senses has universally tho' tacitely in the schools in the pulpit and in common life been allow'd to belong to the will of man and no one has ever pretended to deny that we can draw inferences concerning human actions and that those inferences are founded on the experienc'd union of like actions with like motives and circumstances The only particular in which any one can differ from me is either that perhaps he will refuse to call this necessity But as long as the meaning is understood I hope the word can do no harm Or that he will maintain there is something else in the operations of matter Now whether it be so or not is of no consequence to religion whatever it may be to natural philosophy I may be mistaken in asserting that we have no idea of any other connexion in the actions of body and shall be glad to be farther instructed on that head But sure I am I ascribe nothing to the actions  of the mind but what must readily be allow'd of Let no one therefore put an invidous construction on my words by saying simply that I assert the necessity of human actions and place them on the same footing with the operations of senseless matter I do not ascribe to the will that unintelligible necessity which is suppos'd to lie in matter But I ascribe to matter that intelligible quality call it necessity or not which the most rigorous orthodoxy does or must allow to belong to the will I change therefore nothing in the receiv'd systems with regard to the will but only with regard to material objects  NAY I shall go farther and assert that this kind of necessity is so essential to religion and morality that without it there must ensue an absolute subversion of both and that every other supposition is entirely destructive to all laws both  divine  and  human  'Tis indeed certain that as all human laws are founded on rewards and punishments 'tis suppos'd as a fundamental principle that these motives have an influence on the mind and both produce the good and prevent the evil actions We may give to this influence what name we please but  as 'tis usually conjoin'd with the action common sense requires it shou'd be esteem'd a cause and be look'd upon as an instance of that necessity which I wou'd establish  THIS reasoning is equally solid when apply'd to  divine  laws so far as the deity is consider'd as a legislator and is suppos'd to inflict punishment and bestow rewards with a design to produce obedience But I also maintain that even where he acts not in his magisterial capacity but is regarded as the avenger of crimes merely on account of their odiousness and deformity not only 'tis impossible without the necessary connexion of cause and effect in human actions that punishments cou'd be inflicted compatible with justice and moral equity but also that it cou'd ever enter into the thoughts of any reasonable being to inflict them The constant and universal object of hatred or anger is a person or creature endow'd with thought and consciousness and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that passion 'tis only by their relation to the person or connexion with him But according to the doctrine of liberty or chance this connexion is reduc'd to nothing nor are men more accountable for those actions  which are design'd and premeditated than for such as are the most casual and accidental Actions are by their very nature temporary and perishing and where they proceed not from some cause in the characters and disposition of the person who perform'd them they infix not themselves upon him and can neither redound to his honour if good nor infamy if evil The action itself may be blameable it may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion But the person is not responsible for it and as it proceeded from nothing in him that is durable or constant and leaves nothing of that nature behind it 'tis impossible he can upon its account become the object of punishment or vengeance According to the hypothesis of liberty therefore a man is as pure and untainted after having committed the most horrid crimes as at the first moment of his birth nor is his character any way concern'd in his actions since they are not deriv'd from it and the wickedness of the one can never be us'd as a proof of the depravity of the other 'Tis only upon the principles of necessity that a person acquires any merit or demerit from his actions however  the common opinion may incline to the contrary  BUT so inconsistent are men with themselves that tho' they often assert that necessity utterly destroys all merit and demerit either towards mankind or superior powers yet they continue still to reason upon these very principles of necessity in all their judgments concerning this matter Men are not blam'd for such evil actions as they perform ignorantly and casually whatever may be their consequences Why but because the causes of these actions are only momentary and terminate in them alone Men are less blam'd for such evil actions as they perform hastily and unpremeditately than for such as proceed from thought and deliberation For what reason but because a hasty temper tho' a constant cause in the mind operates only by intervals and infects not the whole character Again repentance wipes off every crime especially if attended with an evident reformation of life and manners How is this to be accounted for But by asserting that actions render a person criminal merely as they are proofs of criminal passions or principles in the mind and when by any alteration  of these principles they cease to be just proofs they likewise cease to be criminal But according to the doctrine of  liberty  or  chance  they never were just proofs and consequently never were criminal  HERE then I turn to my adversary and desire him to free his own system from these odious consequences before he charge them upon others Or if he rather chuses that this question shou'd be decided by fair arguments before philosophers than by declamations before the people let him return to what I have advanc'd to prove that liberty and chance are synonimous and concerning the nature of moral evidence and the regularity of human actions Upon a review of these reasonings I cannot doubt of an entire victory and therefore having prov'd that all actions of the will have particular causes I proceed to explain what these causes are and how they operate  SECT III  Of the influencing motives of the will  NOTHING is more usual in philosophy and even in common life than to talk of the combat of passion and reason to give the preference to reason and assert that men are only so far virtuous as they conform themselves to its dictates Every rational creature 'tis said is oblig'd to regulate his actions by reason and if any other motive or principle challenge the direction of his conduct he ought to oppose it 'till it be entirely subdu'd or at least brought to a conformity with that superior principle On this method of thinking the greatest part of moral philosophy antient and modern seems to be founded nor is their an ampler field as well for metaphysical arguments as popular declamations than this suppos'd preeminence of reason above passion The eternity invariableness and divine origin of the former have been display'd to the best advantage The blindness unconstancy and deceitfulness  of the latter have been as strongly insisted on In order to shew the fallacy of all this philosophy I shall endeavour to prove  first  that reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will and  secondly  that it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will  THE understanding exerts itself after two different ways as it judges from demonstration or probability as it regards the abstract relations of our ideas or those relations of objects of which experience only gives us information I believe it scarce will be asserted that the first species of reasoning alone is ever the cause of any action As it's proper province is the world of ideas and as the will always places us in that of realities demonstration and volition seem upon that account to be totally remov'd from each other Mathematics indeed are useful in all mechanical operations and arithmetic in almost every art and profession But 'tis not of themselves they have any influence Mechanics are the art of regulating the motions of bodies  to some design'd end or purpose  and the reason why we employ arithmetic in fixing the proportions of numbers is only that we may discover  the proportions of their influence and operation A merchant is desirous of knowing the sum total of his accounts with any person Why but that he may learn what sum will have the same  effects  in paying his debt and going to market as all the particular articles taken together Abstract or demonstrative reasoning therefore never influences any of our actions but only as it directs our judgment concerning causes and effects which leads us to the second operation of the understanding  'TIS obvious that when we have the prospect of pain or pleasure from any object we feel a consequent emotion of aversion or propensity and are carry'd to avoid or embrace what will give us this uneasiness or satisfaction 'Tis also obvious that this emotion rests not here but making us cast our view on every side comprehends whatever objects are connected with its original one by the relation of cause and effect Here then reasoning takes place to discover this relation and according as our reasoning varies our actions receive a subsequent variation But 'tis evident in this case that the impulse arises not from reason but is only directed by it 'Tis from the prospect  of pain or pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises towards any object And these emotions extend themselves to the causes and effects of that object as they are pointed out to us by reason and experience It can never in the least concern us to know that such objects are causes and such others effects if both the causes and effects be indifferent to us Where the objects themselves do not affect us their connexion can never give them any influence and 'tis plain that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us  SINCE reason alone can never produce any action or give rise to volition I infer that the same faculty is as incapable of preventing volition or of disputing the preference with any passion or emotion This consequence is necessary 'Tis impossible reason cou'd have the latter effect of preventing volition but by giving an impulse in a contrary direction to our passion and that impulse had it operated alone wou'd have been able to produce volition Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of passion but a contrary impulse and if this contrary impulse ever arises from reason that  latter faculty must have an original influence on the will and must be able to cause as well as hinder any act of volition But if reason has no original influence 'tis impossible it can withstand any principle which has such an efficacy or ever keep the mind in suspence a moment Thus it appears that the principle which opposes our passion cannot be the same with reason and is only call'd so in an improper sense We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them As this opinion may appear somewhat extraordinary it may not be improper to confirm it by some other considerations  A PASSION is an original existence or if you will modification of existence and contains not any representative quality which renders it a copy of any other existence or modification When I am angry I am actually possest with the passion and in that emotion have no more a reference to any other object than when I am thirsty or sick or more than five foot high 'Tis impossible therefore that this passion can be oppos'd by or be contradictory to  truth and reason since this contradiction consists in the disagreement of ideas consider'd as copies with those objects which they represent  WHAT may at first occur on this head is that as nothing can be contrary to truth or reason except what has a reference to it and as the judgments of our understanding only have this reference it must follow that passions can be contrary to reason only so far as they are  accompany'd  with some judgment or opinion According to this principle which is so obvious and natural 'tis only in two senses that any affection can be call'd unreasonable First When a passion such as hope or fear grief or joy despair or security is founded on the supposition of the existence of objects which really do not exist Secondly When in exerting any passion in action we chuse means insufficient for the design'd end and deceive ourselves in our judgment of causes and effects Where a passion is neither founded on false suppositions nor chuses means insufficient for the end the understanding can neither justify nor condemn it 'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching  of my finger 'Tis not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin to prevent the least uneasiness of an  Indian  or person wholly unknown to me 'Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledg'd lesser good to my greater and have a more ardent affection for the former than the latter A trivial good may from certain circumstances produce a desire superior to what arises from the greatest and most valuable enjoyment nor is there any thing more extraordinary in this than in mechanics to see one pound weight raise up a hundred by the advantage of its situation In short a passion must be accompany'd with some false judgment in order to its being unreasonable and even then 'tis not the passion properly speaking which is unreasonable but the judgment  THE consequences are evident Since a passion can never in any sense be call'd unreasonable but when founded on a false supposition or when it chuses means insufficient for the design'd end 'tis impossible that reason and passion can ever oppose each other or dispute for the government of the will and actions The moment we perceive the falshood of any supposition or the insufficiency  of any means our passions yield to our reason without any opposition I may desire any fruit as of an excellent relish but whenever you convince me of my mistake my longing ceases I may will the performance of certain actions as means of obtaining any desir'd good but as my willing of these actions is only secondary and founded on the supposition that they are causes of the propos'd effect as soon as I discover the falshood of that supposition they must become indifferent to me  'TIS natural for one that does not examine objects with a strict philosophic eye to imagine that those actions of the mind are entirely the same which produce not a different sensation and are not immediately distinguishable to the feeling and perception Reason for instance exerts itself without producing any sensible emotion and except in the more sublime disquisitions of philosophy or in the frivolous subtilties of the schools scarce ever conveys any pleasure or uneasiness Hence it proceeds that every action of the mind which operates with the same calmness and tranquillity is confounded with reason by all those who judge of things from the first view and appearance  Now 'tis certain there are certain calm desires and tendencies which tho' they be real passions produce little emotion in the mind and are more known by their effects than by the immediate feeling or sensation These desires are of two kinds either certain instincts originally implanted in our natures such as benevolence and resentment the love of life and kindness to children or the general appetite to good and aversion to evil consider'd merely as such When any of these passions are calm and cause no disorder in the soul they are very readily taken for the determinations of reason and are suppos'd to proceed from the same faculty with that which judges of truth and falshood Their nature and principles have been suppos'd the same because their sensations are not evidently different  BESIDE these calm passions which often determine the will there are certain violent emotions of the same kind which have likewise a great influence on that faculty When I receive any injury from another I often feel a violent passion of resentment which makes me desire his evil and punishment independent of all considerations  of pleasure and advantage to myself When I am immediately threaten'd with any grievous ill my fears apprehensions and aversions rise to a great height and produce a sensible emotion  THE common error of metaphysicians has lain in ascribing the direction of the will entirely to one of these principles and supposing the other to have no influence Men often act knowingly against their interest For which reason the view of the greatest possible good does not always influence them Men often counteract a violent passion in prosecution of their interests and designs 'Tis not therefore the present uneasiness alone which determines them In general we may observe that both these principles operate on the will and where they are contrary that either of them prevails according to the  general  character or  present  disposition of the person What we call strength of mind implies the prevalence of the calm passions above the violent tho' we may easily observe there is no man so constantly possess'd of this virtue as never on any occasion to yield to the sollicitations of passion and desire From these variations of temper proceeds the great difficulty  of deciding concerning the actions and resolutions of men where there is any contrariety of motives and passions  SECT IV  Of the causes of the violent passions  THERE is not in philosophy a subject of more nice speculation than this of the different  causes  and  effects  of the calm and violent passions 'Tis evident passions influence not the will in proportion to their violence or the disorder they occasion in the temper but on the contrary that when a passion has once become a settled principle of action and is the predominant inclination of the soul it commonly produces no longer any sensible agitation As repeated custom and its own force have made every thing yield to it it directs the actions and conduct without that opposition and emotion which so naturally attend every momentary gust of passion We must therefore distinguish betwixt a calm and a weak passion betwixt a violent and a strong one But notwithstanding this  'tis certain that when we wou'd govern a man and push him to any action 'twill commonly be better policy to work upon the violent than the calm passions and rather take him by his inclination than what is vulgarly call'd his  reason  We ought to place the object in such particular situations as are proper to encrease the violence of the passion For we may observe that all depends upon the situation of the object and that a variation in this particular will be able to change the calm and the violent passions into each other Both these kinds of passions pursue good and avoid evil and both of them are encreas'd or diminish'd by the encrease or diminution of the good or evil But herein lies the difference betwixt them The same good when near will cause a violent passion which when remote produces only a calm one As this subject belongs very properly to the present question concerning the will we shall here examine it to the bottom and shall consider some of those circumstances and situations of objects which render a passion either calm or violent  'TIS a remarkable property of human nature that any emotion which attends a  passion is easily converted into it tho' in their natures they be originally different from and even contrary to each other 'Tis true in order to make a perfect union among passions there is always requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas nor is one relation sufficient for that purpose But tho' this be confirm'd by undoubted experience we must understand it with its proper limitations and must regard the double relation as requisite only to make one passion produce another When two passions are already produc'd by their separate causes and are both present in the mind they readily mingle and unite tho' they have but one relation and sometimes without any The predominant passion swallows up the inferior and converts it into itself The spirits when once excited easily receive a change in their direction and 'tis natural to imagine this change will come from the prevailing affection The connexion is in many respects closer betwixt any two passions than betwixt any passion and indifference  WHEN a person is once heartily in love the little faults and caprice of his mistress the jealousies and quarrels to which that  commerce is so subject however unpleasant and related to anger and hatred are yet found to give additional force to the prevailing passion 'Tis a common artifice of politicians when they wou'd affect any person very much by a matter of fact of which they intend to inform him first to excite his curiosity delay as long as possible the satisfying it and by that means raise his anxiety and impatience to the utmost before they give him a full insight into the business They know that his curiosity will precipitate him into the passion they design to raise and assist the object in its influence on the mind A soldier advancing to the battle is naturally inspir'd with courage and confidence when he thinks on his friends and fellowsoldiers and is struck with fear and terror when he reflects on the enemy Whatever new emotion therefore proceeds from the former naturally encreases the courage as the same emotion proceeding from the latter augments the fear by the relation of ideas and the conversion of the inferior emotion into the predominant Hence it is that in martial discipline the uniformity and lustre of our habit the regularity of our figures  and motions with all the pomp and majesty of war encourage ourselves and allies while the same objects in the enemy strike terror into us tho' agreeable and beautiful in themselves  SINCE passions however independent are naturally transfus'd into each other if they are both present at the same time it follows that when good or evil is plac'd in such a situation as to cause any particular emotion beside its direct passion of desire or aversion that latter passion must acquire new force and violence  THIS happens among other cases whenever any object excites contrary passions For 'tis observable that an opposition of passions commonly causes a new emotion in the spirits and produces more disorder than the concurrence of any two affections of equal force This new emotion is easily converted into the predominant passion and encreases its violence beyond the pitch it wou'd have arriv'd at had it met with no opposition Hence we naturally desire what is forbid and take a pleasure in performing actions merely because they are unlawful The notion of duty when opposite to the passions is seldom able to overcome  them and when it fails of that effect is apt rather to encrease them by producing an opposition in our motives and principles  THE same effect follows whether the opposition arises from internal motives or external obstacles The passion commonly acquires new force and violence in both cases The efforts which the mind makes to surmount the obstacle excite the spirits and inliven the passion  UNCERTAINTY has the same influence as opposition The agitation of the thought the quick turns it makes from one view to another the variety of passions which succeed each other according to the different views All these produce an agitation in the mind and transfuse themselves into the predominant passion  THERE is not in my opinion any other natural cause why security diminishes the passions than because it removes that uncertainty which encreases them The mind when left to itself immediately languishes and in order to preserve its ardour must be every moment supported by a new flow of passion For the same reason despair tho' contrary to security has a like influence  'TIS certain nothing more powerfully animates any affection than to conceal some part of its objects by throwing it into a kind of shade which at the same time that it shews enough to prepossess us in favour of the object leaves still some work for the imagination Besides that obscurity is always attended with a kind of uncertainty the effort which the fancy makes to compleat the idea rouzes the spirits and gives an additional force to the passion  As despair and security tho' contrary to each other produce the same effects so absence is observ'd to have contrary effects and in different circumstances either encreases or diminishes our affections The  Duc de la Rochefoucault  has very well observ'd that absence destroys weak passions but encreases strong as the wind extinguishes a candle but blows up a fire Long absence naturally weakens our idea and diminishes the passion But where the idea is so strong and lively as to support itself the uneasiness arising from absence encreases the passion and gives it new force and violence  SECT V  Of the effects of custom  BUT nothing has a greater effect both to encrease and diminish our passions to convert pleasure into pain and pain into pleasure than custom and repetition Custom has two  original  effects upon the mind in bestowing a  facility  in the performance of any action or the conception of any object and afterwards a  tendency or inclination  towards it and from these we may account for all its other effects however extraordinary  WHEN the soul applies itself to the performance of any action or the conception of any object to which it is not accustom'd there is a certain unpliableness in the faculties and a difficulty of the spirit's moving in their new direction As this difficulty excites the spirits 'tis the source of wonder surprize and of all the emotions which arise from novelty and is in itself very agreeable like every thing which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree But  tho' surprize be agreeable in itself yet as it puts the spirits in agitation it not only augments our agreeable affections but also our painful according to the foregoing principle  that every emotion which precedes or attends a passion is easily converted into it  Hence every thing that is new is most affecting and gives us either more pleasure or pain than what strictly speaking naturally belongs to it When it often returns upon us the novelty wears off the passions subside the hurry of the spirits is over and we survey the objects with greater tranquillity  BY degrees the repetition produces a facility which is another very powerful principle of the human mind and an infallible source of pleasure where the facility goes not beyond a certain degree And here 'tis remarkable that the pleasure which arises from a moderate facility has not the same tendency with that which arises from novelty to augment the painful as well as the agreeable affections The pleasure of facility does not so much consist in any ferment of the spirits as in their orderly motion which will sometimes be so powerful as even to convert pain into pleasure and give  us a relish in time for what at first was most harsh and disagreeable  BUT again as facility converts pain into pleasure so it often converts pleasure into pain when it is too great and renders the actions of the mind so faint and languid that they are no longer able to interest and support it And indeed scarce any other objects become disagreeable thro' custom but such as are naturally attended with some emotion or affection which is destroy'd by the too frequent repetition One can consider the clouds and heavens and trees and stones however frequently repeated without ever feeling any aversion But when the fair sex or music or good cheer or any thing that naturally ought to be agreeable becomes indifferent it easily produces the opposite affection  BUT custom not only gives a facility to perform any action but likewise an inclination and tendency towards it where it is not entirely disagreeable and can never be the object of inclination And this is the reason why custom encreases all  active  habits but diminishes  passive  according to the observation of a late eminent philosopher The facility takes off from the force of the passive habits by  rendering the motion of the spirits faint and languid But as in the active the spirits are sufficiently supported of themselves the tendency of the mind gives them new force and bends them more strongly to the action  SECT VI  Of the influence of the imagination on the passions  TIS remarkable that the imagination and affections have a close union together and that nothing which affects the former can be entirely indifferent to the latter Wherever our ideas of good or evil acquire a new vivacity the passions become more violent and keep pace with the imagination in all its variations Whether this proceeds from the principle abovemention'd  that any attendant emotion is easily converted into the predominant  I shall not determine 'Tis sufficient for my present purpose that we have many instances to confirm this influence of the imagination upon the passions  ANY pleasure with which we are acquainted affects us more than any other which we own to be superior but of whose nature we are wholly ignorant Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea The other we conceive under the general notion of pleasure and 'tis certain that the more general and universal any of our ideas are the less influence they have upon the imagination A general idea tho' it be nothing but a particular one consider'd in a certain view is commonly more obscure and that because no particular idea by which we represent a general one is ever fix'd or determinate but may easily be chang'd for other particular ones which will serve equally in the representation  THERE is a noted passage in the history of  Greece  which may serve for our present purpose  Themistocles  told the  Athenians  that he had form'd a design which wou'd be highly useful to the public but which 'twas impossible for him to communicate to them without ruining the execution since its success depended entirely on the secrecy with which it shou'd be conducted The  Athenians  instead of granting him full power to act as he thought fitting order'd  him to communicate his design to  Aristides  in whose prudence they had an entire confidence and whose opinion they were resolv'd blindly to submit to The design of  Themistocles  was secretly to set fire to the fleet of all the  Grecian  commonwealths which was assembled in a neighbouring port and which being once destroy'd wou'd give the  Athenians  the empire of the sea without any rival  Aristides  return'd to the assembly and told them that nothing cou'd be more advantageous than the design of  Themistocles  but at the same time that nothing cou'd be more unjust Upon which the people unanimously rejected the project  A LATE celebrated  Mons  Rollin  historian admires this passage of antient history as one of the most singular that is any where to be met with  Here  says he  they are not philosophers to whom 'tis easy in their schools to establish the finest maxims and most sublime rules of morality who decide that interest ought never to prevail above justice 'Tis a whole people interested in the proposal which is made to them who consider it as of importance to the public good and who notwithstanding reject it unanimously and without hesitation merely  because it is contrary to justice  For my part I see nothing so extraordinary in this proceeding of the  Athenians  The same reasons whieh render it so easy for philosophers to establish these sublime maxims tend in part to diminish the merit of such a conduct in that people Philosophers never ballance betwixt profit and honesty because their decisions are general and neither their passions nor imaginations are interested in the objects And tho' in the present case the advantage was immediate to the  Athenians  yet as it was known only under the general notion of advantage without being conceiv'd by any particular idea it must have had a less considerable influence on their imaginations and have been a less violent temptation than if they had been acquainted with all its circumstances Otherwise 'tis difficult to conceive that a whole people unjust and violent as men commonly are shou'd so unanimously have adher'd to justice and rejected any considerable advantage  ANY satisfaction which we lately enjoy'd and of which the memory is fresh and recent operates on the will with more violence than another of which the traces  are decay'd and almost obliterated From whence does this proceed but that the memory in the first case assists the fancy and gives an additional force and vigour to its conceptions The image of the past pleasure being strong and violent bestows these qualities on the idea of the future pleasure which is connected with it by the relation of resemblance  A PLEASURE which is suitable to the way of life in which we are engag'd excites more our desires and appetites than another which is foreign to it This phaenomenon may be explain'd from the same principle  NOTHING is more capable of infusing any passion into the mind than eloquence by which objects are represented in their strongest and most lively colours We may of ourselves acknowledge that such an object is valuable and such another odious but 'till an orator excites the imagination and gives force to these ideas they may have but a feeble influence either on the will or the affections  BUT eloquence is not always necessary The bare opinion of another especially when inforc'd with passion will cause an idea of  good or evil to have an influence upon us which wou'd otherwise have been entirely neglected This proceeds from the principle of sympathy or communication and sympathy as I have already observ'd is nothing but the conversion of an idea into an impression by the force of imagination  'TIS remarkable that lively passions commonly attend a lively imagination In this respect as well as others the force of the passion depends as much on the temper of the person as the nature or situation of the object  I HAVE already observ'd that belief is nothing but a lively idea related to a present impression This vivacity is a requisite circumstance to the exciting all our passions the calm as well as the violent nor has a mere fiction of the imagination any considerable influence upon either of them 'Tis too weak to take any hold of the mind or be attended with emotion  SECT VII  Of contiguity and distance in space and time  THERE is an easy reason why every thing contiguous to us either in space or time shou'd be conceiv'd with a peculiar force and vivacity and excel every other object in its influence on the imagination Ourself is intimately present to us and whatever is related to self must partake of that quality But where an object is so far remov'd as to have lost the advantage of this relation why as it is farther remov'd its idea becomes still fainter and more obscure wou'd perhaps require a more particular examination  'TIS obvious that the imagination can never totally forget the points of space and time in which we are existent but receives such frequent advertisements of them from the passions and senses that however it may turn its attention to foreign and remote objects it is necessitated every moment to reflect  on the present 'Tis also remarkable that in the conception of those objects which we regard as real and existent we take them in their proper order and situation and never leap from one object to another which is distant from it without running over at least in a cursory manner all those objects which are interpos'd betwixt them When we reflect therefore on any object distant from ourselves we are oblig'd not only to reach it at first by passing thro' all the intermediate space betwixt ourselves and the object but also to renew our progress every moment being every moment recall'd to the consideration of ourselves and our present situation 'Tis easily conceiv'd that this interruption must weaken the idea by breaking the action of the mind and hindering the conception from being so intense and continu'd as when we reflect on a nearer object The  fewer  steps we make to arrive at the object and the  smoother  the road is this diminution of vivacity is less considerably felt but still may be observ'd more or less in proportion to the degrees of distance and difficulty  HERE then we are to consider two kinds of objects the contiguous and remote of  which the former by means of their relation to ourselves approach an impression in force and vivacity the latter by reason of the interruption in our manner of conceiving them appear in a weaker and more imperfect light This is their effect on the imagination If my reasoning be just they must have a proportionable effect on the will and passions Contiguous objects must have an influence much superior to the distant and remote Accordingly we find in common life that men are principally concern'd about those objects which are not much remov'd either in space or time enjoying the present and leaving what is afar off to the care of chance and fortune Talk to a man of his condition thirty years hence and he will not regard you Speak of what is to happen tomorrow and he will lend you attention The breaking of a mirror gives us more concern when at home than the burning of a house when abroad and some hundred leagues distant  BUT farther tho' distance both in space and time has a considerable effect on the imagination and by that means on the will and passions yet the consequence of a removal  in  space  are much inferior to those of a removal in  time  Twenty years are certainly but a small distance of time in comparison of what history and even the memory of some may inform them of and yet I doubt if a thousand leagues or even the greatest distance of place this globe can admit of will so remarkably weaken our ideas and diminish our passions A  WestIndia  merchant will tell you that he is not without concern about what passes in  Jamaica  tho' few extend their views so far into futurity as to dread very remote accidents  THE cause of this phaenomenon must evidently lie in the different properties of space and time Without having recourse to metaphysics any one may easily observe that space or extension consists of a number of coexistent parts dispos'd in a certain order and capable of being at once present to the sight or feeling On the contrary time or succession tho' it consists likewise of parts never presents to us more than one at once nor is it possible for any two of them ever to be coexistent These qualities of the objects have a suitable effect on the imagination The parts of extension  being susceptible of an union to the senses acquire an union in the fancy and as the appearance of one part excludes not another the transition or passage of the thought thro' the contiguous parts is by that means render'd more smooth and easy On the other hand the incompatibility of the parts of time in their real existence separates them in the imagination and makes it more  difficult  for that faculty to trace any long succession or series of events Every part must appear single and alone nor can regularly have entrance into the fancy without banishing what is suppos'd to have been immediately precedent By this means any distance in time causes a greater interruption in the thought than an equal distance in space and consequently weakens more considerably the idea and consequently the passions which depend in a great measure on the imagination according to my system  THERE is another phaenomenon of a like nature with the foregoing viz  the superior effects of the same distance in futurity above that in the past  This difference with respect to the will is easily accounted for As none of our actions can alter the past 'tis not strange it shou'd never determine  the will But with respect to the passions the question is yet entire and well worth the examining  BESIDES the propensity to a gradual progression thro' the points of space and time we have another peculiarity in our method of thinking which concurs in producing this phaenomenon We always follow the succession of time in placing our ideas and from the consideration of any object pass more easily to that which follows immediately after it than to that which went before it We may learn this among other instances from the order which is always observ'd in historical narrations Nothing but an absolute necessity can oblige an historian to break the order of time and in his  narration  give the precedence to an event which was in  reality  posterior to another  THIS will easily be apply'd to the question in hand if we reflect on what I have before observ'd that the present situation of the person is always that of the imagination and that 'tis from thence we proceed to the conception of any distant object When the object is past the progression of the thought in passing to it from the present  is contrary to nature as proceeding from one point of time to that which is preceding and from that to another preceding in opposition to the natural course of the succession On the other hand when we turn our thought to a future object our fancy flows along the stream of time and arrives at the object by an order which seems most natural passing always from one point of time to that which is immediately posterior to it This  easy  progression of ideas favours the imagination and makes it conceive its object in a stronger and fuller light than when we are continually oppos'd in our passage and are oblig'd to overcome the difficulties arising from the natural propensity of the fancy A small degree of distance in the past has therefore a greater effect in interupting and weakening the conception than a much greater in the future From this effect of it on the imagination is deriv'd its influence on the will and passions  THERE is another cause which both contributes to the same effect and proceeds from the same quality of the fancy by which we are determin'd to trace the succession of time by a similar succession of ideas When from the present instant we  consider two points of time equally distant in the future and in the past 'tis evident that abstractedly consider'd their relation to the present is almost equal For as the future will  sometime  be present so the past was  once  present If we cou'd therefore remove this quality of the imagination an equal distance in the past and in the future wou'd have a similar influence Nor is this only true when the fancy remains fix'd and from the present instant surveys the future and the past but also when it changes its situation and places us in different periods of time For as on the one hand in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the present instant and the future object we find the future object approach to us and the past retire and become more distant So on the other hand in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the present and the past the past approaches to us and the future becomes more distant But from the property of the fancy abovemention'd we rather chuse to fix our thought on the point of time interpos'd betwixt the present and  the future than on that betwixt the present and the past We advance rather than retard our existence and following what seems the natural succession of time proceeed from past to present and from present to future By which means we conceive the future as flowing every moment nearer us and the past as retiring An equal distance therefore in the past and in the future has not the same effect on the imagination and that because we consider the one as continually encreasing and the other as continually diminishing The fancy anticipates the course of things and surveys the object in that condition to which it tends as well as in that which is regarded as the present  SECT VIII  The same subject continu'd  THUS we have accounted for three phaenomena which seem pretty remarkable Why distance weakens the conception and passion Why distance in time has a greater effect than that in space And why distance in past time has still a greater effect than that in future We must now consider three phaenomena which seem to be in a manner the reverse of these Why a very great distance encreases our esteem and admiration for an object Why such a distance in time encreases it more than that in space And a distance in past time more than that in future The curiousness of the subject will I hope excuse my dwelling on it for some time  To begin with the first phaenomenon why a great distance encreases our esteem and admiration for an object 'tis evident that the mere view and contemplation of any greatness whether successive or extended enlarges the soul and give it a sensible delight and pleasure A wide plain the  ocean eternity a succession of several ages all these are entertaining objects and excel every thing however beautiful which accompanies not its beauty with a suitable greatness Now when any very distant object is presented to the imagination we naturally reflect on the interpos'd distance and by that means conceiving something great and magnificent receive the usual satisfaction But as the fancy passes easily from one idea to another related to it and transports to the second all the passions excited by the first the admiration which is directed to the distance naturally diffuses itself over the distant object Accordingly we find that 'tis not necessary the object shou'd be actually distant from us in order to cause our admiration but that 'tis sufficient if by the natural association of ideas it conveys our view to any considerable distance A great traveller tho' in the same chamber will pass for a very extraordinary person as a  Greek  medal even in our cabinet is always esteem'd a valuable curiosity Here the object by a natural transition conveys our view to the distance and the admiration which arises from that distance by another natural transition returns back to the object  BUT tho' every great distance produces an admiration for the distant object a distance in time has a more considerable effect than that in space Antient busts and inscriptions are more valu'd than  Japan  tables And not to mention the  Greeks  and  Romans  'tis certain we regard with more veneration the old  Chaldeans  and  Egyptians  than the modern  Chinese  and  Persians  and bestow more fruitless pains to clear up the history and chronology of the former than it wou'd cost us to make a voyage and be certainly inform'd of the character learning and government of the latter I shall be oblig'd to make a digression in order to explain this phaenomenon  'TIS a quality very observable in human nature that any opposition which does not entirely discourage and intimidate us has rather a contrary effect and inspires us with a more than ordinary grandeur and magnanimity In collecting our force to overcome the opposition we invigorate the soul and give it an elevation with which otherwise it wou'd never have been acquainted Compliance by rendering our strength useless makes us insensible of it but opposition awakens and employs it  THIS is also true in the inverse Opposition not only enlarges the soul but the soul when full of courage and magnanimity in a manner seeks opposition  Spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis  Optat aprum aut fulvum descendere monte leonem  WHATEVER supports and fills the passions is agreeable to us as on the contrary what weakens and infeebles them is uneasy As opposition has the first effect and facility the second no wonder the mind in certain dispositions desires the former and is averse to the latter  THESE principles have an effect on the imagination as well as on the passions To be convinc'd of this we need only consider the influence of  heights  and  depths  on that faculty Any great elevation of place communicates a kind of pride or sublimity of imagination and gives a fancy'd superiority over those that lie below and  vice versa  a sublime and strong imagination conveys the idea of ascent and elevation Hence it proceeds that we associate in a manner  the idea of whatever is good with that of height and evil with lowness Heaven is suppos'd to be above and hell below A noble genius is call'd an elevate and sublime one  Atque udam spernit humum fugiente penna  On the contrary a vulgar and trivial conception is stil'd indifferently low or mean Prosperity is denominated ascent and adversity descent Kings and princes are suppos'd to be plac'd at the top of human affairs as peasants and daylabourers are said to be in the lowest stations These methods of thinking and of expressing ourselves are not of so little consequence as they may appear at first sight  'TIS evident to common sense as well as philosophy that there is no natural nor essential difference betwixt high and low and that this distinction arises only from the gravitation of matter which produces a motion from the one to the other The very same direction which in this part of the globe is call'd  ascent  is denominated  descent  in our antipodes which can proceed from nothing but the contrary tendency of bodies Now 'tis certain that the tendency of bodies continually operating upon our senses must produce from custom a like  tendency in the fancy and that when we consider any object situated in an ascent the idea of its weight gives us a propensity to transport it from the place in which it is situated to the place immediately below it and so on 'till we come to the ground which equally stops the body and our imagination For a like reason we feel a difficulty in mounting and pass not without a kind of reluctance from the inferior to that which is situated above it as if our ideas acquir'd a kind of gravity from their objects As a proof of this do we not find that the facility which is so much study'd in music and poetry is call'd the fall or cadency of the harmony or period the idea of facility communicating to us that of descent in the same manner as descent produces a facility  SINCE the imagination therefore in running from low to high finds an opposition in its internal qualities and principles and since the soul when elevated with joy and courage in a manner seeks opposition and throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action where its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it it follows that every thing which  invigorates and inlivens the soul whether by touching the passions or imagination naturally conveys to the fancy this inclination for ascent and determines it to run against the natural stream of its thoughts and conceptions This aspiring progress of the imagination suits the present disposition of the mind and the difficulty instead of extinguishing its vigour and alacrity has the contrary effect of sustaining and encreasing it Virtue genius power and riches are for this reason associated with height and sublimity as poverty slavery and folly are conjoin'd with descent and lowness Were the case the same with us as  Milton  represents it to be with the angels to whom  descent is adverse  and who  cannot sink without labour and compulsion  this order of things wou'd be entirely inverted as appears hence that the very nature of ascent and descent is deriv'd from the difficulty and propensity and consequently every one of their effects proceeds from that origin  ALL this is easily apply'd to the present question why a considerable distance in time produces a greater veneration for the distant objects than a like removal in space The imagination moves with more difficulty  in passing from one portion of time to another than in a transition thro' the parts of space and that because space or extension appears united to our senses while time or succession is always broken and divided This difficulty when join'd with a small distance interrupts and weakens the fancy But has a contrary effect in a great removal The mind elevated by the vastness of its object is still farther elevated by the difficulty of the conception and being oblig'd every moment to renew its efforts in the transition from one part of time to another feels a more vigorous and sublime disposition than in a transition thro' the parts of space where the ideas flow along with easiness and facility In this disposition the imagination passing as is usual from the consideration of the distance to the view of the distant objects gives us a proportionable veneration for it and this is the reason why all the relicts of antiquity are so precious in our eyes and appear more valuable than what is brought even from the remotest parts of the world  THE third phaenomenon I have remark'd will be a full confirmation of this 'Tis not every removal in time which has the  effect of producing veneration and esteem We are not apt to imagine our posterity will excel us or equal our ancestors This phaenomenon is the more remarkable because any distance in futurity weakens not our ideas so much as an equal removal in the past Tho' a removal in the past when very great encreases our passions beyond a like removal in the future yet a small removal has a greater influence in diminishing them  IN our common way of thinking we are plac'd in a kind of middle station betwixt the past and future and as our imagination finds a kind of difficulty in running along the former and a facility in following the course of the latter the difficulty conveys the notion of ascent and the facility of the contrary Hence we imagine our ancestors to be in a manner mounted above us and our posterity to lie below us Our fancy arrives not at the one without effort but easily reaches the other Which effort weakens the conception where the distance is small but enlarges and elevates the imagination when attended with a suitable object As on the other hand the facility assists the fancy in a small removal  but takes off from its force when it contemplates any considerable distance  IT may not be improper before we leave this subject of the will to resume in a few words all that has been said concerning it in order to set the whole more distinctly before the eyes of the reader What we commonly understand by  passion  is a violent and sensible emotion of mind when any good or evil is presented or any object which by the original formation of our faculties is fitted to excite an appetite By  reason  we mean affections of the very same kind with the former but such as operate more calmly and cause no disorder in the temper Which tranquillity leads us into a mistake concerning them and causes us to regard them as conclusions only of our intellectual faculties Both the  causes  and  effects  of these violent and calm passions are pretty variable and depend in a great measure on the peculiar temper and disposition of every individual Generally speaking the violent passions have a more powerful influence on the will tho' 'tis often found that the calm ones when corroborated by reflection and seconded by resolution are able to controul them in their most furious  movements What makes this whole affair more uncertain is that a calm passion may easily be chang'd into a violent one either by a change of temper or of the circumstances and situation of the object as by the borrowing of force from any attendant passion by custom or by exciting the imagination Upon the whole this struggle of passion and of reason as it is call'd diversifies human life and makes men so different not only from each other but also from themselves in different times Philosophy can only account for a few of the greater and more sensible events of this war but must leave all the smaller and more delicate revolutions as dependent on principles too fine and minute for her comprehension  SECT IX  Of the direct passions  TIS easy to observe that the passions both direct and indirect are founded on pain and pleasure and that in order to produce an affection of any kind 'tis only requisite to present some good or evil Upon the removal of pain and pleasure there immediately follows a removal of love and hatred pride and humility desire and aversion and of most of our reflective or secondary impressions  THE impressions which arise from good and evil most naturally and with the least preparation are the  direct  passions of desire and aversion grief and joy hope and fear along with volition The mind by an  original  instinct tends to unite itself with the good and to avoid the evil tho' they be conceiv'd merely in idea and be consider'd as to exist in any future period of time  BUT supposing that there is an immediate impression of pain or pleasure and  that  arising from an object related to ourselves or others  this does not prevent the propensity or aversion with the consequent emotions but by concurring with certain dormant principles of the human mind excites the new impressions of pride or humility love or hatred That propensity which unites us to the object or seperates us from it still continues to operate but in conjunction with the  indirect  passions which arise from a double relation of impressions and ideas  THESE indirect passions being always agreeable or uneasy give in their turn additional force to the direct passions and encrease our desire and aversion to the object Thus a suit of fine cloaths produces pleasure from their beauty and this pleasure produces the direct passions or the impressions of volition and desire Again when these cloaths are consider'd as belonging to ourself the double relation conveys to us the sentiment of pride which is an indirect passion and the pleasure which attends that passion returns back to the direct affections and gives new force to our desire or volition joy or hope  WHEN good is certain or probable it produces JOY When evil is in the same situation there arises GRIEF or SORROW  WHEN either good or evil is uncertain it gives rise to FEAR or HOPE according to the degrees of uncertainty on the one side or the other  DESIRE arises from good consider'd simply and AVERSION is deriv'd from evil The WILL exerts itself when either the good or the absence of the evil may be attain'd by any action of the mind or body  BESIDE good and evil or in other words pain and pleasure the direct passions frequently arise from a natural impulse or instinct which is perfectly unaccountable Of this kind is the desire of punishment to our enemies and of happiness to our friends hunger lust and a few other bodily appetites These passions properly speaking produce good and evil and proceed not from them like the other affections  NONE of the direct affections seem to merit our particular attention except hope and fear which we shall here endeavour to account for 'Tis evident that the very same event which by its certainty wou'd produce grief or joy gives always rise to fear or hope when only probable and uncertain In order therefore to understand  the reason why this circumstance makes such a considerable difference we must reflect on what I have already advanc'd in the preceding book concerning the nature of probability  PROBABILITY arises from an opposition of contrary chances or causes by which the mind is not allow'd to fix on either side but is incessantly tost from one to another and at one moment is determin'd to consider an object as existent and at another moment as the contrary The imagination or understanding call it which you please fluctuates betwixt the opposite views and tho' perhaps it may be oftner turn'd to the one side than the other 'tis impossible for it by reason of the opposition of causes or chances to rest on either The  pro  and  con  of the question alternately prevail and the mind surveying the object in its opposite principles finds such a contrariety as utterly destroys all certainty and establish'd opinion  SUPPOSE then that the object concerning whose reality we are doubtful is an object either of desire or aversion 'tis evident that according as the mind turns itself either to the one side or the other it  must feel a momentary impression of joy or sorrow An object whose existence we desire gives satisfaction when we reflect on those causes which produce it and for the same reason excites grief or uneasiness from the opposite consideration So that as the understanding in all probable questions is divided betwixt the contrary points of view the affections must in the same manner be divided betwixt opposite emotions  NOW if we consider the human mind we shall find that with regard to the passions 'tis not of the nature of a windinstrument of music which in running over all the notes immediately loses the sound after the breath ceases but rather resembles a stringinstrument where after each stroke the vibrations still retain some sound which gradually and insensibly decays The imagination is extreme quick and agile but the passions are slow and restive For which reason when any object is presented that affords a variety of views to the one and emotions to the other tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the  other According as the probability inclines to good or evil the passion of joy or sorrow predominates in the composition Because the nature of probability is to cast a superior number of views or chances on one side or which is the same thing a superior number of returns of one passion or since the dispers'd passions are collected into one a superior degree of that passion That is in other words the grief and joy being intermingled with each other by means of the contrary views of the imagination produce by their union the passions of hope and fear  UPON this head there may be started a very curious question concerning that contrariety of passions which is our present subject 'Tis observable that where the objects of contrary passions are presented at once beside the encrease of the predominant passion which has been already explain'd and commonly arises at their first shock or rencounter it sometimes happens that both the passions exist successively and by short intervals sometimes that they destroy each other and neither of them takes place and sometimes that both of them remain united in the mind It may  therefore be ask'd by what theory we can explain these variations and to what general principle we can reduce them  WHEN the contrary passions arise from objects entirely different they take place alternately the want of relation in the ideas seperating the impressions from each other and preventing their opposition Thus when a man is afflicted for the loss of a lawsuit and joyful for the birth of a son the mind running from the agreeable to the calamitous object with whatever celerity it may perform this motion can scarcely temper the one affection with the other and remain betwixt them in a state of indifference  IT more easily attains that calm situation when the same event is of a mixt nature and contains something adverse and something prosperous in its different circumstances For in that case both the passions mingling with each other by means of the relation become mutually destructive and leave the mind in perfect tranquility  BUT suppose in the third place that the object is not a compound of good or evil but is consider'd as probable or improbable in any degree in that case I assert  that the contrary passions will both of them be present at once in the soul and instead of destroying and tempering each other will subsist together and produce a third impression or affection by their union Contrary passions are not capable of destroying each other except when their contrary movements exactly rencounter and are opposite in their direction as well as in the sensation they produce This exact rencounter depends upon the relations of those ideas from which they are deriv'd and is more or less perfect according to the degrees of the relation In the case of probability the contrary chances are so far related that they determine concerning the existence or nonexistence of the same object But this relation is far from being perfect since some of the chances lie on the side of existence and others on that of nonexistence which are objects altogether incompatible 'Tis impossible by one steady view to survey the opposite chances and the events dependent on them but 'tis necessary that the imagination shou'd run alternately from the one to the other Each view of the imagination produces its peculiar passion which decays away by degrees and is  follow'd by a sensible vibration after the stroke The incompatibility of the views keeps the passions from shocking in a direct line if that expression may be allow'd and yet their relation is sufficient to mingle their fainter emotions 'Tis after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different mixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy and from their imperfect union and conjunction  UPON the whole contrary passions succeed each other alternately when they arise from different objects They mutually destroy each other when they proceed from different parts of the same And they subsist both of them and mingle together when they are deriv'd from the contrary and incompatible chances or possibilities on which any one object depends The influence of the relations of ideas is plainly seen in this whole affair If the objects of the contrary passions be totally different the passions are like two opposite liquors in different bottles which have no influence on each other If the objects be intimately connected the passions are like an  alcali  and an  acid  which being mingled destroy each other If the relation be more imperfect and consists in  the contradictory views of the same object the passions are like oil and vinegar which however mingled never perfectly unite and incorporate  AS the hypothesis concerning hope and fear carries its own evidence along with it we shall be the more concise in our proofs A few strong arguments are better than many weak ones  THE passions of fear and hope may arise when the chances are equal on both sides and no superiority can be discover'd in the one above the other Nay in this situation the passions are rather the strongest as the mind has then the least foundation to rest upon and is toss'd with the greatest uncertainty Throw in a superior degree of probability to the side of grief you immediately see that passion diffuse itself over the composition and tincture it into fear Encrease the probability and by that means the grief the fear prevails still more and more till at last it runs insensibly as the joy continually diminishes into pure grief After you have brought it to this situation diminish the grief after the same manner that you encreas'd it by diminishing the probability on that side and  you'll see the passion clear every moment 'till it changes insensibly into hope which again runs after the same manner by slow degrees into joy as you encrease that part of the composition by the encrease of the probability Are not these as plain proofs that the passions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief and joy as in optics 'tis a proof that a colour'd ray of the sun passing thro' a prism is a composition of two others when as you diminish or encrease the quantity of either you find it prevail proportionably more or less in the composition I am sure neither natural nor moral philosophy admits of stronger proofs  PROBABILITY is of two kinds either when the object is really in itself uncertain and to be determin'd by chance or when tho' the object be already certain yet 'tis uncertain to our judgment which finds a number of proofs on each side of the question Both these kinds of probabilities cause fear and hope which can only proceed from that property in which they agree  viz  the uncertainty and fluctuation they bestow on the imagination by that contrariety of views which is common to both  'TIS a probable good or evil that commonly produces hope or fear because probability being a wavering and unconstant method of surveying an object causes naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of passion But we may observe that whereever from other causes this mixture can be produc'd the passions of fear and hope will arise even tho' there be no probability which must be allow'd to be a convincing proof of the present hypothesis  WE find that an evil barely conceiv'd as  possible  does sometimes produce fear especially if the evil be very great A man cannot think of excessive pains and tortures without trembling if he be in the least danger of suffering them The smallness of the probability is compensated by the greatness of the evil and the sensation is equally lively as if the evil were more probable One view or glimpse of the former has the same effect as several of the latter  BUT they are not only possible evils that cause fear but even some allow'd to be  impossible  as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice tho' we know ourselves to be in perfect security and have it in our choice whether we will advance a step farther  This proceeds from the immediate presence of the evil which influences the imagination in the same manner as the certainty of it wou'd do but being encounter'd by the reflection on our security is immediately retracted and causes the same kind of passion as when from a contrariety of chances contrary passions are produc'd  EVILS that are  certain  have sometimes the same effect in producing fear as the possible or impossible Thus a man in a strong prison wellguarded without the least means of escape trembles at the thought of the rack to which he is sentenc'd This happens only when the certain evil is terrible and confounding in which case the mind continually rejects it with horror while it continually presses in upon the thought The evil is there fix'd and establish'd but the mind cannot endure to fix upon it from which fluctuation and uncertainty there arises a passion of much the same appearance with fear  BUT 'tis not only where good or evil is uncertain as to its  existence  but also as to its  kind  that fear or hope arises Let one be told by a person whose veracity he cannot doubt of that one of his sons is suddenly  kill'd 'tis evident the passion this event wou'd occasion wou'd not settle into pure grief till he got certain information which of his sons he had lost Here there is an evil certain but the kind of it uncertain Consequently the fear we feel on this occasion is without the least mixture of joy and arises merely from the fluctuation of the fancy betwixt its objects And tho' each side of the question produces here the same passion yet that passion cannot settle but receives from the imagination a tremulous and unsteady motion resembling in its cause as well as in its sensation the mixture and contention of grief and joy  FROM these principles we may account for a phaenomenon in the passions which at first sight seems very extraordinary  viz  that surprize is apt to change into fear and every thing that is unexpected affrights us The most obvious conclusion from this is that human nature is in general pusilanimous since upon the sudden appearance of any object we immediately conclude it to be an evil and without waiting till we can examine its nature whether it be good or bad are at first affected with fear This I say is the most obvious conclusion but upon  farther examination we shall find that the phaenomenon is otherwise to be accounted for The suddenness and strangeness of an appearance naturally excite a commotion in the mind like every thing for which we are not prepar'd and to which we are not accustom'd This commotion again naturally produces a curiosity or inquisitiveness which being very violent from the strong and sudden impulse of the object becomes uneasy and resembles in its fluctuation and uncertainty the sensation of fear or the mix'd passions of grief and joy This image of fear naturally converts into the thing itself and gives us a real apprehension of evil as the mind always forms its judgments more from its present disposition than from the nature of its objects  THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a strong connexion with fear even tho' they do not cause any opposition of passions by the opposite views and considerations they present to us A person who has left his friend in any malady will feel more anxiety upon his account than if he were present tho' perhaps he is not only incapable of giving him assistance but likewise of judging of the event of his sickness In  this case tho' the principal object of the passion  viz  the life or death of his friend be to him equally uncertain when present as when absent yet there are a thousand little circumstances of his friend's situation and condition the knowledge of which fixes the idea and prevents that fluctuation and uncertainty so near ally'd to fear Uncertainty is indeed in one respect as near ally'd to hope as to fear since it makes an essential part in the composition of the former passion but the reason why it inclines not to that side is that uncertainty alone is uneasy and has a relation of impressions to the uneasy passions  'TIS thus our uncertainty concerning any minute circumstance relating to a person encreases our apprehensions of his death or misfortune  Horace  has remark'd this phaenomenon  Ut assidens implumibus pullus avis  Serpentium allapsus timet  Magis relictis non ut adsit auxili  Latura plus presentibus  BUT this principle of the connexion of fear with uncertainty I carry farther and  observe that any doubt produces that passion even tho' it presents nothing to us on any side but what is good and desireable A virgin on her bridalnight goes to bed full of fears and apprehensions tho' she expects nothing but pleasure of the highest kind and what she has long wish'd for The newness and greatness of the event the confusion of wishes and joys so embarrass the mind that it knows not on what passion to fix itself from whence arises a fluttering or unsettledness of the spirits which being in some degree uneasy very naturally degenerates into fear  THUS we still find that whatever causes any fluctuation or mixture of passions with any degree of uneasiness always produces fear or at least a passion so like it that they are scarcely to be distinguish'd  I HAVE here confin'd myself to the examination of hope and fear in their most simple and natural situation without considering all the variations they may receive from the mixture of different views and reflections  Terror consternation astonishment anxiety  and other passions of that kind are nothing but different species and  degrees of fear 'Tis easy to imagine how a different situation of the object or a different turn of thought may change even the sensation of a passion and this may in general account for all the particular subdivisions of the other affections as well as of fear Love may shew itself in the shape of  tenderness friendship intimacy esteem goodwill  and in many other appearances which at the bottom are the same affections and arise from the same causes tho' with a small variation which it is not necessary to give any particular account of 'Tis for this reason I have all along confin'd myself to the principal passion  THE same care of avoiding prolixity is the reason why I wave the examination of the will and direct passions as they appear in animals since nothing is more evident than that they are of the same nature and excited by the same causes as in human creatures I leave this to the reader's own observation desiring him at the same time to consider the additional force this bestows on the present system  SECT X  Of curiosity or the love of truth  BUT methinks we have been not a little inattentive to run over so many different parts of the human mind and examine so many passions without taking once into the consideration that love of truth which was the first source of all our enquiries 'Twill therefore be proper before we leave this subject to bestow a few reflections on that passion and shew its origin in human nature 'Tis an affection of so peculiar a kind that 'twoud have been impossible to have treated of it under any of those heads which we have examin'd without danger of obscurity and confusion  TRUTH is of two kinds consisting either in the discovery of the proportions of ideas consider'd as such or in the conformity of our ideas of objects to their real existence 'Tis certain that the former species of truth is not desir'd merely as truth and that 'tis not the  justness of our conclusions which alone gives the pleasure For these conclusions are equally just when we discover the equality of two bodies by a pair of compasses as when we learn it by a mathematical demonstration and tho' in the one case the proofs be demonstrative and in the other only sensible yet generally speaking the mind acquiesces with equal assurance in the one as in the other And in an arithmetical operation where both the truth and the assurance are of the same nature as in the most profound algebraical problem the pleasure is very inconsiderable if rather it does not degenerate into pain Which is an evident proof that the satisfaction which we sometimes receive from the discovery of truth proceeds not from it merely as such but only as endow'd with certain qualities  THE first and most considerable circumstance requisite to render truth agreeable is the genius and capacity which is employ'd in its invention and discovery What is easy and obvious is never valu'd and even what is  in itself  difficult if we come to the knowledge of it without difficulty  and without any stretch of thought or judgment is but little regarded We love to trace the demonstrations of mathematicians but shou'd receive small entertainment from a person who shou'd barely inform us of the proportions of lines and angles tho' we repos'd the utmost confidence both in his judgment and veracity In this case 'tis sufficient to have ears to learn the truth We never are oblig'd to fix our attention or exert our genius which of all other exercises of the mind is the most pleasant and agreeable  BUT tho' the exercise of genius be the principal source of that satisfaction we receive from the sciences yet I doubt if it be alone sufficient to give us any considerable enjoyment The truth we discover must also be of some importance 'Tis easy to multiply algebraical problems to infinity nor is there any end in the discovery of the proportions of conic sections tho' few mathematicians take any pleasure in these researches but turn their thoughts to what is more useful and important Now the question is after what manner this utility and importance operate upon  us The difficulty on this head arises from hence that many philosophers have consurn'd their time have destroy'd their health and neglected their fortune in the search of such truths as they esteem'd important and useful to the world tho' it appear'd from their whole conduct and behaviour that they were not endow'd with any share of public spirit nor had any concern for the interests of mankind Were they convinc'd that their discoveries were of no consequence they wou'd entirely lose all relish for their studies and that tho' the consequences be entirely indifferent to them which seems to be a contradiction  TO remove this contradiction we must consider that there are certain desires and inclinations which go no farther than the imagination and are rather the faint shadows and images of passions than any real affections Thus suppose a man who takes a survey of the fortifications of any city considers their strength and advantages natural or acquir'd observes the disposition and contrivance of the bastions ramparts mines and other military works 'tis plain that in proportion as all these are fitted to attain their ends he will receive a suitable  pleasure and satisfaction This pleasure as it arises from the utility not the form of the objects can be no other than a sympathy with the inhabitants for whose security all this art is employ'd tho' 'tis possible that this person as a stranger or an enemy may in his heart have no kindness for them or may even entertain a hatred against them  IT may indeed be objected that such a remote sympathy is a very slight foundation for a passion and that so much industry and application as we frequently observe in philosophers can never be deriv'd from so inconsiderable an original But here I return to what I have already remark'd that the pleasure of study consists chiefly in the action of the mind and the exercise of the genius and understanding in the discovery or comprehension of any truth If the importance of the truth be requisite to compleat the pleasure 'tis not on account of any considerable addition which of itself it brings to our enjoyment but only because 'tis in some measure requisite to fix our attention When we are careless and inattentive the same action of the understanding has no effect upon us nor is able to  convey any of that satisfaction which arises from it when we are in another disposition  BUT beside the action of the mind which is the principal foundation of the pleasure there is likewise requir'd a degree of success in the attainment of the end or the discovery of that truth we examine Upon this head I shall make a general remark which may be useful on many occasions  viz  that where the mind pursues any end with passion tho' that passion be not deriv'd originally from the end but merely from the action and pursuit yet by the natural course of the affections we acquire a concern for the end itself and are uneasy under any disappointment we meet with in the pursuit of it This proceeds from the relation and parallel direction of the passions abovemention'd  TO illustrate all this by a similar instance I shall observe that there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each other than those of hunting and philosophy whatever disproportion may at first sight appear betwixt them 'Tis evident that the pleasure of hunting consists in the action of the mind and body the motion the attention  the difficulty and the uncertainty 'Tis evident likewise that these actions must be attended with an idea of utility in order to their having any effect upon us A man of the greatest fortune and the farthest remov'd from avarice tho' he takes a pleasure in hunting after patridges and pheasants feels no satisfaction in shooting crows and magpies and that because he considers the first as fit for the table and the other as entirely useless Here 'tis certain that the utility or importance of itself causes no real passion but is only requisite to support the imagination and the same person who overlooks a ten times greater profit in any other subject is pleas'd to bring home half a dozen woodcocks or plovers after having employ'd several hours in hunting after them To make the parallel betwixt hunting and philosophy more compleat we may observe that tho' in both cases the end of our action may in itself be despis'd yet in the heat of the action we acquire such an attention to this end that we are very uneasy under any disappointments and are sorry when we either miss our game or fall into any error in our reasoning  IF we want another parallel to these affections we may consider the passion of gaming which affords a pleasure from the same principles as hunting and philosophy It has been remark'd that the pleasure of gaming arises not from interest alone since many leave a sure gain for this entertainment Neither is it deriv'd from the game alone since the same persons have no satisfaction when they play for nothing But proceeds from both these causes united tho' separately they have no effect 'Tis here as in certain chymical preparations where the mixture of two clear and transparent liquids produces a third which is opaque and colour'd  THE interest which we have in any game engages our attention without which we can have no enjoyment either in that or in any other action Our attention being once engag'd the difficulty variety and sudden reverses of fortune still farther interest us and 'tis from that concern our satisfaction arises Human life is so tiresome a scene and men generally are of such indolent dispositions that whatever amuses them tho' by a passion mixt with pain does in the main give them a sensible pleasure And  this pleasure is here encreas'd by the nature of the objects which being sensible and of a narrow compass are enter'd into with facility and are agreeable to the imagination  THE same theory that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and algebra may be extended to morals politics natural philosophy and other studies where we consider not the abstract relations of ideas but their real connexions and existence But beside the love of knowledge which displays itself in the sciences there is a certain curiosity implanted in human nature which is a passion deriv'd from a quite different principle Some people have an insatiable desire of knowing the actions and circumstances of their neighbours tho' their interest be no way concern'd in them and they must entirely depend on others for their information in which case there is no room for study or application Let us search for the reason of this phaenomenon  IT has been prov'd at large that the influence of belief is at once to inliven and infix any idea in the imagination and prevent all kind of hesitation and uncertainty about it Both these circumstances are advantageous  By the vivacity of the idea we interest the fancy and produce tho' in a lesser degree the same pleasure which arises from a moderate passion As the vivacity of the idea gives pleasure so its certainty prevents uneasiness by fixing one particular idea in the mind and keeping it from wavering in the choice of its objects 'Tis a quality of human nature which is conspicuous on many occasions and is common both to the mind and body that too sudden and violent a change is unpleasant to us and that however any objects may in themselves be indifferent yet their alteration gives uneasiness As 'tis the nature of doubt to cause a variation in the thought and transport us suddenly from one idea to another it must of consequence be the occasion of pain This pain chiefly takes place where interest relation or the greatness and novelty of any event interests us in it 'Tis not every matter of fact of which we have a curiosity to be inform'd neither are they such only as we have an interest to know 'Tis sufficient if the idea strikes on us with such force and concerns us so nearly as to give us an uneasiness in its instability and inconstancy A stranger  when he arrives first at any town may be entirely indifferent about knowing the history and adventures of the inhabitants but as he becomes farther acquainted with them and has liv'd any considerable time among them he acquires the same curiosity as the natives When we are reading the history of a nation we may have an ardent desire of clearing up any doubt or difficulty that occurs in it but become careless in such researches when the ideas of these events are in a great measure obliterated  FINIS  BOOKS printed for  JOHN NOON  at the
