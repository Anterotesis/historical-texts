great price  Pet iii  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR and sold by M LEWIS Paternosterrow and J MATHEWS Strand  Price d with allowance to those who are disposed to give them away  AN AFFECTIONATE ADDRESS  MY BRETHREN  SUFFER a word of exhortation from a heart that knows its own bitterness and grones under the ruins of a sinful nature and disordered passions Permit one who freely owns with grief and shame that he is naturally of a very hasty temper and passionate disposition to address you on the evil of indulging and giving way to this In this attempt I humbly crave your most serious attention and affectionate regard hoping herein mine eye is singly directed to our Lord's glory and my heart sincerely engaged for your spiritual good and my own Bear with my freedom as I assure you I desire to write from  my own  sense and experience of this evil as well from observation of it in others would apply to  my own soul  all that I write to you and desire to fall under every conviction  myself  which I may bring against you  I am persuaded you must you will join me in freely confessing that to indulge and exalt a spirit and temper contrary to meekness and quietness is as opposite to our profession of being disciples and followers of the meek and lowly Jesus as light is to darkness or heaven to hell and that such a conduct is to be condemned But yet how many such professors do day after day live and act under the power of their uncontrouled tempers and unsubdued passions of bitter anger furious wrath and unbridled resentment Yes and what is most to be lamented they do not seem to see the least  evil in all this are not humbled for it nor are they striving against it but are rather saying I do well to be angry They find excuses to palliate the evil and to justify their bad conduct O my brethren these things ought not so to be Who can observe without great concern of mind and grief of soul what advantage satan gets over such One would therefore sincerely wish to drop a word in season to such  In order therefore through the blessing of our Lord to fasten conviction upon your heart and mine for and to prevent such conduct the Lord help us to consider  st The blessedness of a meek and quiet spirit  dly The evil of a contrary one And  dly Point out some remedies against it  As to the blessedness of a meek and quiet spirit It is the offspring of heaventhe gift of Goda fruit of the Holy Spiritobtained for us by the blood of Jesusconferred on us when we are born into him by his Spirit and made new creatures in him thro' the faith of the operation of God and is enjoyed by walking in fellowship with God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ Hence no marvel that Peter says "The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of God of great price" Pet iii The necessity of putting it on and adorning ourselves with it from day to day and from hour to hour under all circumstances and appearance of things must be allowed to be absolutely necessary if we have any regard to the glory of God our loving Father any concern for the honor of Jesus our meek and lowly Saviour any desire to possess the peace of faith the joy of hope the comfort of love and the witness of God the Holy Spirit in our own hearts any  zeal for the credit of our most holy religion to make it honorable in the sight of our brethren and to recommend it to the world A real undissembled regard to all this is closely connected with and enters into the very essence of the blessedness of a meek and quiet spirit Therefore consider  st The blessedness it is of to our own souls For there are many great and precious promises which belong to and which meek and quiet spirits may joyfully claim and be comforted by But pride avaunt For thou art at the bottom of every evil temper and sinful passion Think not that any one promise is made to us or belongs to us for and on account of any inherent meekness of spirit or quietness of temper we are naturally possessed of No The promises are ALL IN CHRIST JESUS are all made to him as our covenant head for and in behalf of all his members "Unto us are  given  exceeding great and precious promises" Pet i Us Who even all who have obtained precious faith in the righteousness of God our Saviour Jesus Christ who are in him united to him and are one with him partakers of the divine nature so as to resemble it and be made comformable to it "Behold thy King cometh unto thee  meek"  Matt xxi When we receive our meek King Jesus into our hearts by faith we then partake of his meekness and gentleness our spirit is changed and conformed in our measure into his Then we find all the exceeding great and precious promises which are in him to be ours also We claim them in him and possessing Christ we may we ought joyfully to take them to ourselves Hear rejoice and comfortably apply them O ye meek spirited sinners  The  meek  will he guide in judgment and the  meek  will he teach his way  Psalm xxv  The LORD lifteth up the  meek  cxlvii  He will beautify the  meek  with salvation  cxlix  The  meek  shall increase their  joy in the LORD  Isaiah xxix  Christ preaches good tidings to the  meek  lxi and pronounces them blessed Matt v Such is the blessedness of the meek  Now by the  meek  in all these places and throughout the word of God is meant the poor in spirit the lowly in their own eyes those who are sensible of their own need and misery are humbled for it and live under an abiding sense of it None are real disciples of Jesus but such None are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus but such None will cleave to and follow our Saviour but such None but such will have any regard to honor and glorify him in the world None but such can apply and enjoy the promises which are in Christ Jesus And it is impossible for any one to have the witness of the Spirit with his spirit that he is a child of God that his sins are pardoned in the blood of Christ unless he is living and walking in lowliness of mind poverty of spirit and meekness of temper But the blessedness of those who are of a meek and quiet spirit consists in the enjoyment of the comforts of the exceeding great and precious promises which are in Christ Jesus Yea and Amen sure and certain to all the heirs of promise to the glory of God Consider  dly Those who are of a meek and quiet spirit are a blessing and comfort to others For they adorn the gospel of God our Saviour rejoice the hearts of their brethren in Christ and cause the way of truth to be wellspoken of in the world O how sweet is the company and conversation of a meek lowly poor in spirit sinner He is ever breathing a sweet savor of the dear Redeemer's matchless love rich grace precious atonement spotless righteousness and finished salvation to others yea and though proud stouthearted selfrighteous sinners do not approve of his faith and hope in the salvation of Christ yet by his sweetness of temper and softness of behavior in gentleness shewing all meekness to all men  and in meekness instructing those who oppose themselves they will at least be won to think there is a certain something which he possesses which is truly amiable and praise worthy and which deserves imitation And how happy does such a soul make those around him or who dwell under the same roof with him If a husband the meekness and quietness of his spirit will not only be an example but a blessing and comfort to the wife of his bosom If a wife she will be so to her husband If a parent the same to his or her children If a master or mistress the same to his or her servants and so each will be to the other in every station and relation Well then might Paul exhort "I beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love" Eph iv But above all  dly Such are blessed in that they honor Christ and glorify the God of their salvation By the meekness of your spirit and quietness of your temper you make it manifest that Jesus is a Saviour a real Saviour a present Saviour that you have been with him and learned of him and that he has saved you from the proud boisterous raging waves of tumultuous passions that he has spoken  Peace be still  and the swelling sea of unruly tempers is hushed into a profound calm So that now you can no more delight in indulging your proud passions and giving way to your bad tempers than you can in gratifying your carnal lusts Hence as Paul says upon another occasion "Others will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth" that the God of peace and love is with you that Christ is upon the throne of your heart that he reigns in you and rules over your evil tempers and brings your unruly passions into captivity to the obedience of himself Yea to the honor and glory of our heavenly King you will make it manifest that his kingdom is not in the word of profession  but in the power of the Holy Ghost And that your tongue which is naturally a fire of hell and a world of iniquity that defileth the whole body setteth on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell which is an unruly member full of deadly poison which no man can tame James iii yet Jesus by the power of his gospel hath tamed and subdued Therefore now to the glory of your Saviour the wild wolf can dwell with the tame Lamb the savage leopard lie down with the harmless kid the fierce lion with the inoffensive calf and a young child can lead those tempers and passions of yours which were heretofore ungovernable and untractable O what glory does this bring to the God of all grace what honor to our dear Saviour's power and love how does it adorn his glorious gospel of peace O brethren for our souls sake for our brethren in Christ's sake for the sake of the honor of our God and Saviour and for his gospel's sake let us be all strife and contention who shall get most of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit from Christ to live most in it and to glorify him most by it It is most pleasant to dwell on this But it is necessary for us to turn to the dark side of the question and consider  dly The evil of indulging a contrary spirit and giving way to opposite tempers This will appear very injurious in a personal and relative point of view  Personal It will be hurtful to ourselves Do we consult the health of our bodies Evil tempers and immoderate passions have a very injurious effect upon the frame of the body How many have sacrificed their lives to a fit of anger How many have lost their senses others their health irrecoverably in a fever of furious passion Well might the heathens stile a fit of anger  brevis furor  short madness But my concern is not so much about the walls of your house as for the good of the tenant which dwells within your precious soul  My message is chiefly to thee O thou immortal part born of God and formed for the enjoyment of God How do sinful anger and unbridled passions affect wound and distress thee Say Conscience Testify thou faithful witness How long since thou didst feel the exaltings of devilish pride and heardest the loud clamors of haughty passions venting their rage and fury to thy wounding and pain Was it lately This day this hour just now How dost thou feel thyself after it  Let us first attend to the evil effects this hath upon the  conscience  A christian's conscience is that inward knowledge it has of divine truths and that testimony it bears to the blessed effects and holy influences which they have upon the soul By the knowledge of the law the conscience is filled with a sense of wrath and condemnation hence it becomes an evil conscience it bears testimony of evil guilt and wrath to the soul By the sprinkling of the blood of Christ upon the heart the conscience is made a good one Heb x It knows and finds peace with God pardon of sin and justification in his sight and it bears a good and comfortable testimony to the soul  Now the christian is called to live under and maintain constantly the testimony of a good conscience by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ and to have the answer of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead Pet iii But giving way to and indulging of any spirit and temper which is contrary to the purity and meekness of the gospel of Christ will rack and torture the conscience wound and grieve it disturb its peace and destroy its comfort Why Because there is a cessation of the christian's living by faith on Christ cleaving to him feeding upon him and enjoying holy fellowship with him  Can we suppose when we see a person violently agitated by a fit of passion that he is at that moment living  under the influence of faith in Jesus love to him and peace with him can we think that he then enjoys an inward calm a sunshine of peace of conscience No we may as well suppose that the sea is in a profound calm when a storm of wind blows O ye fretful passionate souls who at every turn that thwarts your purpose and opposes your inclination fly into a rage of unruly passion how do you exalt folly folly of the most egregious kind more so than if ye were to wound your flesh with lancets for ye wound your consciences distract your minds and distress your souls You sacrifice your peace of conscience your comfort of mind your joy of soul in Jesusfor what for the indulging a fit of rage giving way to wrathful resentment and gratifying a devilish passion Hereby you make Christ's friends mourn his enemies rejoice the devils sport and yourselveswhat shall I say what compare you to much worse than Solomon's madman who "casteth firebrands arrows and death and saith Am not I in sport" Prov xxvi Sad sport for hereby you deceive your own soul and rob your conscience of sweet peace in Jesus and heavenly joy in the Holy Ghost May the Lord set this home upon my heart as well as yours O may conviction fasten upon each of us for having thus exalted folly may Jesus pardon what is past and strengthen our souls to resist and overcome this evil in future  Suffer me here to drop a hint to your souls and mine If after a fit of passion and exalting any evil tempers we do not find our conscience wounded and pained but still possessing its courage and confidence this is no good sign It argues a stupidity of conscience and of its being hardened through the deceitfulness of sin For a tender conscience will feel the evil even of a hasty word spoken in a spirit and temper inconsistent with the purity and peace of the gospel the soul will be humbled under  it grieved for it and have recourse to the blood of Christ for the pardon of it But by a long and habitual course of giving way to evil tempers and indulging sinf  passions a person may be so blinded thereby as not to see the evil thereof and so hardened therein as not to feel the bad effects of them  Hence how many aim to justify such conduct saying "Every man has his fault and this is mine True I have bad tempers I am of a passionate disposition they are natural to me I cannot help it they are soon over and I bear no malice" This is cursed reasoning quite opp  site to the language of faith To judge any ones state is not o  r province but this we may sa  ely say men are to be known by their fruits As such conduct and such language are not the fruits of holy faith in Jesus do not flow from love to him therefore sadly evidence that such a soul  ither has not been convinced of the evil of sin by the Spirit of holiness or has lost the sense of it from his con  ence that he is not living by the faith of the Son of God and walking under the influence of his gospel no  ore than a profane swearer or an open adulterer is  erefore he does not cannot enjoy the testimony of his  science that he pleases God feel the peace of God  his conscience the love of God shed abroad in his  and the Holy Spirit bearing witness with his spi  that he is a child of God  If this address should fall into the hands of any such e  ders I dare appeal to them whether this is not a true eseription of their state whether they do not walk in a  kness respecting the state of their soul and whether t  times they do not tremble in uncertainty fearig all will not go well with them at last dreadig lest their precious souls should be rejected by Jesus  ith  Go ye cursed  O this is an awful state to live in ut most awful to die in The Lord help such to lay to heart to see the evil of it and to fly to Jesus for  pardon for it and power over it But to proceed Consider dly The evil of such conduct as it hinders our prayers I do not mean that it totally prevents our  saying prayers  though it is to be feared it often has this effect also but it hinders the spirit of prayer We may keep up the form when the life and spirit of prayer is quite evaporated It is no unusual thing to have the form of prayer kept up in families where the spirit of violent passions and evil tempers reign in the heads of those families They will say prayers with their families at night after they have lived in the storm of passion with them all the day Yea before they called them in to prayer it was prefaced with a storm which only subsided till the prayers were over and then the storm was as violent as before Surely such prayers connected with such conduct must be an abomination to the Lord O how are souls deceived herein and their prayers hindred hereby Says Paul "I will that holy men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting" Tim ii But where there is wrath of spirit there will be doubting of heart and hands cannot be lifted up to God with boldness nor souls find freedom of access to him Where the spirit of meekness quietness and peace does not reign in the tempers the spirit of prayer doth not live in the heart nor can fervent effectual prayers ascend from the lips Therefore our Lord says "In your patience possess ye your souls" Luke xxi "Be patient towards all men" Thess "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil" Eph iv from hence it plainly appears that an impatient passionate wrathful man is so devilish complaisant as to give place to the devil to let him take the upper hand of him by giving way to passions and tempers which are agreeable to his proud and furious nature Judge then Can the Spirit of Christ the spirit of prayer dwell in such and proceed  from such No marvel such complain of the coldness deadness and langour of their prayers when their sinful passions and evil tempers are so warm and lively From hence we may conclude he who lives and walks under the evil influence of them has satan for his companion all day he that lies down under the power of them has satan for his bedfellow at night Fa  the    dly Sinful passions and unholy tempers are  +trary to the peace of faith and destructive of the joy  and comfort of love in a meek and h  ly Saviour "C  nsider your calling brethren even hereunto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an  xample that we should follow his steps" Pet ii Can you think we are following the example of Christ's patience and meekness of spirit and are treading in his st  p  of humility of heart and lowliness of mind if you indulge your angry passionate tempers And if these prevail over us can we enjoy the comfort of faith and the joy of hope within us It is impossible Do we believe Christ hath suffered for our sins Do we hope for salvation through his sufferings and death What and not study to follow the example of his life nor strive to tread in his steps Let us be assured two more opposite characters cannot possibly exist than a meek lowly patient Saviour and a furious proud impatient disciple  Be assured true faith leads the soul to look for consormity to the life of Christ as well as expects salvation from wrath by his death The hope of seeing Jesus in glory purifies the heart from evil tempers and the life from sinful passions even as Christ is pure and in such the comfort of faith and the joy of hope abounds But where there is the strise of passion and the fury of anger there is confusion and every evil work If the power of faith in Christ does not prevail over our sinful passions the peace of faith cannot rule in the heart The joy of hope in Jesus cannot be possessed while the mind is  agitated with the tumult of passion The comfort of love will be banished by anger and wrath No marvel then if our evil tempers and sinful passions have the ascendency over us that we have not joy and peace in believing within us Do you complain for want of the comfort of faith and the joy of hope Look to your conduct See if you do not by the fury of your passions and giving way to your evil tempers grieve the Spirit and drive that peaceful guest from your bosom  The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them who make peace James iii But if you sow to anger and passion and war and strife spring up you can reap nothing but the fruit of discord and dejection But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness c and the works of the flesh are manifest which are variance emulation wrath strife c Gal v xix Now see whether you are of the Spirit or of the flesh Which are you governed by and live under the influence of what fruits do you bear and bring forth in the general course of your life and tenor of your behavior Are they such as are agreeable to faith and hope in our Lord or are they such as are destructive of the peace of faith the joy of hope and the comfort of love in him But  thly Indulging our unholy tempers and sinful passions will prevent our profiting by hearing of the gospel of peace What avails hearing a form of sound words if we are not cast into the mould of them and receive not the impressions of a peaceable spirit from them The gospel preaches peace by Jesus Christ from God to poor sinners But we cannot receive this in the spirit of peace while our angry passions and evil tempers prevail over us Though the seed of the word be sown it cannot take deep root it will not spring up nor bear any fruit in a passionate breast but will soon be choaked by disordered tempers If we live under the power of  evil tempers and passions though we may hear the gospel like the gospel and delight to set under the preaching of it yet it will be with us as it was with the people who sat under Ezekiel's ministry Saith the Lord "They sit before thee as  my people  and hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart goeth after their sins and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words and do them not" Ezek xxxiii Now here is a true picture of unprofitable hearers They like they seem delighted with the sound of the gospel it charms their passions into composure and their tempers into serenity How long Till the sound is passed from their ears and their feet have reached their dwellings There instead of striving to mix faith with the word and casting themselves humbly down before the Lord to steep the seed of the word in meditation and prayer alas the birds of prey some fierce passions some unruly tempers are exalted which devour the seed and no profit is gained by it Though such hear the word "be at peace among yourselves" Thess v "Follow peace with all men" Heb xii "Seek peace and ensue it" Pet iii Though peace flees from you yet pursue and overtake it Yet they do it not But instead of this every little thing calls up their passions to arms and enrages their tempers and they are soon engaged in the war of commotion They do not as exhorted "receive with  meekness  the engrafted word which is able to save the soul for if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain" James i  The Lord help us to see and feel the evil of thus giving way in the least herein O may we not be suffered to be thus a shame to the gospel but  may we find it to be the power of God to the salvation of us from our unruly tempers and unholy passions  But to proceed one step farther to consider this evil in respect to others We all stand in some though different relations to each other in life And we all may be yea certainly are profitable or hurtful to each other by the spirit and temper of our behavior We are prone to catch evil tempers and sinful passions from each other and to provoke one another to wrath We teach very powerfully by our examples The tinder of passion soon catches the falling spark and kindles into a flame for we all have the tinder of it in our nature The seeds of every evil temper and sinful passion are in us all and are soon brought forth  n  o fruit by bad example My own soul is bowed down on account of past bad conduct herein O what an evil what an injurious example do we set our children our servants and all about us by exciting a spirit and temper contrary to the profession we make of being disciples and followers of the meek and lowly Jesus This calls for great humblings of soul before the Lord  Fiery tempers and impetuous passions give others but a very indifferent opinion either of the holy truths we profess or of the reality of our belief of them You cannot you dare not you will not have a heart with boldness and consistency to reprove a child a servant or a friend for passionate tempers and angry words when you live and act under the influence of them yourselves They will gag your mouth and stop your reproof If they do not the natural reply to you may be  Physician heal thyself  O how does such an allowed evil teach confirm and harden others in the same What a reproach does it bring upon our holy profession How does it cause the name of God and his doctrine to be blasphemed Is it not very natural for others tauntingly to say "See here are your saints of God these  are your believers in Christ these are they who profess to believe their sins are forgiven and expect salvation by Christ but behold they are slaves to their passions carried away captives by their evil tempers and live under the influence of anger wrath and contention just like other men What sort of a Saviour do they believe in These are the effects of such doctrines they adhere to"  O my brethren have I not urged enough against this evil fully to convince  you  of it Sure I am I have said enough to make  me  ashamed of ever giving way to evil tempers and indulging sinful passions and to humble my soul to the dust before our Lord for them Well might Paul put this cutting interrogation to us What fruit had ye then in th  se things whereof ye are now ashamed And add this awful assertion "For the end of those things is death" Rom vi But hath Jesus died to save us from death Is the gift of God eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Is Christ able to save us to the uttermost from our evil tempers and passions What remains then but that we study strive and pray for the mastery over those evil tempers and sinful passions which are in us and which are prone to prevail over us Lord stir us up to a diligen  enquiry after and a close and constant attention to those means which tend to produce a contrary spirit and temper in our lives and conversations  To point out some remedies against giving way to our evil empers and sinful passions was the last thing to be attended to And  st Let us receive it as a fixed and certain truth the Lord impress it deeply on our hearts that fiery passions proceed from cursed pride that cu  sed pride was forged i  the fi  e  f hell and its mischievous shape for  ed upon the devil's anvil Know yours  lf Who are you What are you In who  e sight do you live and under  whose inspection do you constantly act You are a sinner a miserable sinner under the sentence of death by the law of God for sin You will soon become sordid dust and ignoble ashes Dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return is thy irreversible doom Does haughty pride become the breast of such vile beings as we are Should imperious airs passionate speeches and wrathful tempers be exalted by us What and these too in the sight and presence of the Lord our judge O how ill becoming such a conduct therefore study and pray ever to maintain upon your mind a constant sense of your own vileness and poverty that you may live in humbleness of mind and lowliness of spirit before the Lord Yea be constantly humbling yourselves under the mighty hand of God because you find and feel in you such tempers and passions which are contrary to the meek and lowly Spirit of your Lord are inconsistent with your being a disciple and follower of him and if indulged will certainly prevent your peace of mind comfort of heart and joy of soul in him and therefore must absolutely be subdued by the power of his grace  Beware that you listen not to any plausible excuses which satan and your own corrupt nature may urge in any wise to justify your evil tempers and disordered passions Though like Agag they may come dressed up delicately yet let  ur hearts be fixed and our faces set as a flint against them not to spare t  em but to hew them in pieces before the Lord for they have often made our hearts comfortless A rooted and abiding conviction of the evil of them will prove a strong antidote against them Meekness of temper proceeds from lowliness of mind and lowliness of mind from a constant sight and sense of our extreme poverty and total vileness and our constant need of and dependence upon the riches of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ "He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he who  ruleth his temper than he who taketh a city" Prov xvi Bette  than the mighty How He lets the peace of God rule in his heart as exhorted" C l iii and the grace of Christ reigns over all the pride and passion of his corrupt nature Thus while the proud heart is humbled Jesus is exalted and the sword of anger he beats into a ploughshare and the spear of wrath into a pruning hook To know ourselves is the greatest knowledge To subdue ourselves the greatest conquest It is true wisdom to avoid an evil true patience to endure it and true valour to conquer it James gives most precious advice to us "My beloved brethren be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath" James i Therefore  dly Watch over your spirit and temper It is the command of your Lord WATCH Why Because ye know not what hour the thief may come Matt xxiv Conside  every evil temper every disordered passion as a thief which comes to rob you of your sweet peace heavenly comfort and holy joy in your Lord Watchfulness is like a strong chai  to a wild beast Such are your furious tempers Chain them down by watchfulness within due bounds David well knew the evil of giving vent to his sinful passions He was in a sweet watchful frame when he says "Set a watch O Lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips" Psalm cxli "He regarded wisdom's voice He who is soon angry dealeth foolishly" Prov xiv Why are we soon angry Because we are fo foolish as not to watch against it It takes us by surprize and overcomes us unawares Therefore the spirit of revelation is constantly exhorting us to watchfulness The evil of passion and the sinfulness of anger are hereby prevented and many comforts enjoyed The duty is ours practise it The power to perform it and the blessings consequent  on it are from the Lord therefore "Watch unto prayer" Pet iv  dly Keep under your body and bring it into subjection A pampered horse is unruly Living high adds fuel to the fire of the passions Selfdenial like an engine cools the fire of the tempers Says our Lord "If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" Mat xvi The more selfdenial for Christ the more enjoyment of Christ the more Christ is enjoyed the more conformity to the lowliness of his mind and meekness of his spirit will prevail If a general cannot conquer a place by storm he will guard every avenue and starve out the inhabitants Soact by the flesh and its sinful passions Tho' you cannot totally  stroy the old man yet do not pamper but starve him so as to mortify and subdue his evil tempers For "if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live" Rom viii Live in the peace of God the love of Christ and the comforts of the Holy Ghost Again  thly Let us ever consider our high state and glorious dignity Are we believers in Christ Then we are born again of the Spirit are one with Christ are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ Hear what Paul says of us "Ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit" Rom viii Not in the flesh How so Do we not carry about us a body of sin and death Have we not all the corrupt affections beastly lu  ts and devilish passions of the flesh in us Yes but notwithstanding all these are in us yet we are not in the flesh not left in our old sinful state of the flesh nor under help  e  s nature but are in the Spirit in a new state wherein all grace abounds to us and all fulness of grace is treasured up for us in Christ yea and every enemy conquered and perfect victory obtained by him in our nature  and on our behalf therefore though we have no inherent stock of grace in ourselves yet being united unto Christ and having fellowship with him we may we ought to be continually receiving out of his fulness to strengthen us to overcome our sinful passions and subdue our evil tempers Assert then your dignity Live above your low earthly groveling passions Be not a slave to the usurping tyranny of your evil tempers Do they beset you Do they teaze you Do they demand admission claim indulgence and plead for gratification Dismiss them with an air of triumph Dispatch them with "Get ye to hell from whence ye came ye baseborn offspring of sin and satan ye are unworthy my attention I am a son of God a companion of Jesus an inhabitant of the Spirit Jesus hath made me KING to reign over you a PRIEST to sacrifice you unto God and an heir of glory to reign eternally with God" What then Attend and obey the voice of the Spirit "Put on therefore as the ELECT of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye" Col iii O let Christ and his forgiving love dwell with you and be the rule and influence of your spirit temper and behavior  My dear Christian brethren we live too low and do not enough consider our high state of dignity in Christ Hence we do not act like ourselves but grovel in the kingdom of nature give way to the passions thereof when we should be soaring to and living in the kingdom of Jesus and possessing those heavenly tempers for which we are new formed by his grace "Therefore stand fast in the faith quit yourselves like men men of God born of his Spirit and one with Christ Be strong" Cor xvi Strong in the Lord Jesus and in the  power of his might so shall ye put to flight the army of the aliens of evil tempers and sinful passions The battle is the Lord's Victory is sure it shall end in his glory and issue in our comfort Therefore  thly Do penance for them Nay don't start I mean not to make an atonement the thought is the highest arrogance but to mortify our proud spirits for them Use this very humbling expedient It will greatly tend to bring down your high stomach and lofty spirit to lay your honor in the dust and to break your proud heart in pieces Take the apostle's advice "Confess your faults one to another" James v When overtaken by passion or surprised into anger let your tongue confess your folly Be not ashamed to do it even to your inferiors yea the more inferior any are to you so much the more good will you get by it and so much the more will it humble our proud spirits for it Saul though a king confesses to David "Behold I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly" Sam xxvi Thus freely and fully confess your folly to others Do not extenuate but magnify the evil of passion the folly of anger and the madness of wrath and beg their prayers for you that you may be healed For it is indeed to play the fool and to err exceedingly from the road of humility the way of peace and the path of comfort To commit a fault and to brave it out is a double evil To confess a fault with a good grace and an humble mind is a victory gained over satan and our proud spirit It will powerfully work upon our brethren's passions for us▪ greatly conciliate their affections to us and excite their prayers in our behalf And sure I am such humbling conduct must be wellpleasing in the sight of our dear Lord who loves to see his people subject one to another and clothed with humility for "he resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble" Pet v  Lastly▪ Above all and in the use of every means to subdue our evil tempers and angry passions let us look unto Jesus come unto Jesus live upon Jesus and walk with Jesus  st Look unto him eye Christ as seeing you encompassed with infirmities knowing your weakness yea touched with a feeling of your infirmities able to succour you under them to strengthen you against them and to give you victory over them Though we see in our flesh dwells no good thing though every evil temper and sinful passion dwell there yet we see Jesus ever lives before the throne for us he is both able and willing to subdue them under us and to save us from the power of them Though they abound in us daily yet let us be daily looking to Christ in whom all fulness of grace dwells for us and the more we feel the abounding of these passions and tempers in us so much the more let us look to Christ for the superabounding of his grace to us For this is his most precious voice to us all through life "Lock unto me and be ye saved" Isa xlv And this is the sweet precious blessed experience of every such looking sinner "We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord" Cor iii When the eye of the soul is taken off from Christ anger rages and passions prevail While the eye is fixed on him they subside and we are changed into lowliness of heart and meekness of spirit O this looking unto Jesus has an amazing effect on us therefore is to be constantly practised by us Glory to God's rich grace that we poor sinners have such a precious Saviour to look to Lord Jesus help us to be ever looking unto thee for salvation from all sin on earth till we see thee and are perfectly like thee in glory  dly Come unto Jesus This is his loving invitation  "Come unto me all ye"  All who Is it all ye who are free from your galling tempers and disordered passions ye who are never distressed by them or perplexed with them O no but ALL YE who labor under them are weary of them and heavy laden with them Then thou even thou and me even me fretful hasty and passionate as our natural tempers and spirits are may come ought to come yea are commanded by Jesus to come unto him Go where and to whom we will beside Jesus and we shall be like the poor woman who had spent all that she had upon physicians but they proved of no value for she only grew worse If we go to selfrighteous proud Pharisees and tell our case they will shake their heads at us pronounce our case desperate our state hopeless and loftily turn away from us Go we to our affectionate sympathizing brethren in Christ they may pity and pray for us but they cannot heal us But O sweet compassion of our loving tender hearted Jesus he says "I WILL GIVE YOU REST" And at once to silence every objection and to revive every encouragement our ever dear Lord adds "I AM MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART"  Meek  to receive you without cruel upbraidings  lowly  to teach you without bitter reflections "Come then unto me and learn of me and ye shall find what ye can no where else obtain REST UNTO YOUR SOULS" Matt xi Rest from turbulent  empers and tumultuous passions even the rest of a lowly heart and a meek spirit O that we may honor Christ more by the belief of his gracious words and come to him daily for the fulfilment of his precious promises  dly Feed upon Jesus For he saith "He who eateth me even he shall live by me" John vi Our passions live are mighty in us and prey upon us because we are not feeding upon and living by Christ Spiritual feeding on Christ in our hearts by faith nourishes our graces and strengthens our souls while it kills our carnal  tempers and subdues nature's passions Feeding upon Christ's love to us will make us grow up into him in love Feeding upon his life will nourish us up into conformity to his meek spirit Feeding upon his death will mortify our old man with his tempers and passions Feeding upon his salvation will make us strong in his might and conquerors over our evil tempers Feeding upon his meekness gentleness longsuffering and kindness to us will make us meek gentle longsuffering and kind to others Feeding upon his precious promises that he will be with us and guide us all through life will be our strength and support in the hour of death and will receive us to himself to be with him in glory will so swallow up our whole man in the sweet peace holy love and heavenly joy of Christ that we shall be constrained to cry out  Let not a single passion dare  Disturb my breast my Lord is there  O for keener appetites thus to feed on Christ by faith that we may so live by him as to glorify him by the softness of our passions and the sweetness of our tempers on earth till we come to live reign with and eternally enjoy our Saviour in glory  thly Walk with Christ It is a common observation A man is known by the company he keeps It is natural to us to catch their manners spirit and temper of behavior This most certainly will hold good respecting Christ and us If we walk in close fellowship with Christ we shall be sure to catch the fire of love from his heavenly flame sweet peace from him who is the pacific ocean and meekness of spirit from him who is the gentle  Lamb of God  I have often thought of poor Peter O how much do I see of my own case in his "Peter followed Christ afar off" Matt xxvi What  was the consequence A very awful one As he was afar off from the presence of Jesus so was he also from his spirit and temper O what a rage of passionate madness seized him Hear and tremble for yourself Behold but not to take any licence from his example or to justify yourself in any such practice behold the disciple of the meek and lowly Jesus cursing and swearing like a Trooper Well Peter if thou wast ashamed of thy Lord he had now much more cause to be ashamed of thee See the dreadful effects of keeping at a distance from Christ As Peter did not keep close to his Lord his Lord left him to his passions which brought a hell of horror into his conscience and he would have dropped into hell itself if his Lord had not looked him by love into repentance unto salvation  O my brethren to walk with and keep close to Christ in heart hope and affection is to live above our sinful passions and at a distance from our evil tempers They cannot prevail over us while Jesus is in company with us What will constitute our blessednes  in glory The presence of Jesus This this is our heaven upon earth now This makes paradise in a world of woe This brings heaven into our soul while it inhabits a body of sin This soothes our tempers and charms our passions into a heavenly frame Hence David in the passion of love and in the jealousy of fear cries out "Forsake me not O my Lord O God be not far from me" Psalm xxxviii To walk close with Christ is to enjoy fellowship with God the Father and this destroys our fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness and subdues all the corrupt lusts and sinful passions of our flesh  Again Walk with Christ and you shall enjoy the comforts of the Holy Ghost He will come and dwell in us and bear his blessed witness to our spir  ts that we are the children of God  Consider well this precious text "God hath exalted Jesus to be a Prince and a Saviour for to give repentance and remission of sins Whereof the Holy Ghost is a witness whom God hath given to them who  obey him"  Acts v The whole glory of the Godhead centers in the work of Jesus for us poor sinners Though the Holy Ghost at first enlightens and convinces us when in a state of enmity to God and rebellion against Christ and lead us to Christ for remission of sins yet afterwards we cannot enjoy his comforts but as we are living in obedience to the will of God the Father And this is his will that we should constantly hear believe on and walk in fellowship with his beloved Son our Prince and our Saviour To this blessed end the Holy Ghost bears witness of Christ in the word and while we are thus living and walking with Christ in faith and love we shall experience victory over our sins Iusts corruptions evil tempers and sinful passions and the Holy Ghost will bear his comfortable witness in our hearts of God the Father's love to us and of God the Son's salvation of us and that we really are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus Now here is the mystery of our most holy faith to the subduing of the mystery of iniquity in us There is no victory over sin ourselves the world and satan but in Christ There is no enjoying remission of sins nor any comfort from the Holy Ghost but in obedience to God in believing  ving and walking with Jesus our exalted Prince and Saviour "Ye know that Christ was manifested to take away our sins" John iii Blessed knowledge of the precious sacrifice of Christ  for us  But this is not all For "the Son of God was also manifested to destroy the works of the devil  in us"  ver O let us take heed that we do not divide Christ do not separate him as being a Saviour  from  sin from his being a sacrifice  for  sin For Christ is of God as much made  sanctification  to us as  redemption  of us Hence says our Lord "If ye love me keep my commandments" and then he promises the COMFORTER to abide with us for ever John xiv  From what has been urged I draw this plain  INFERENCE  The Lord impress the importance of it deeply upon all our hearts It is th  s The gospel of the grace of God which brings salvation to us by Jesus Christ ONLY hath the most genuine and powerful influence upon the whole man to engage the affections to purify the heart to subdue the passions to regulate the whole conduct and to bring every thought word and work into captivity to the obedience of Christ Therefore whereever there is true living faith on the Son of God as the Saviour of sinners that soul will be daily coming to him in poverty of spirit feeding upon him in humbleness of mind and walking with him in lowliness of hear  hungering and thi  sting after righteousness and looking to receive out of Christ's fulness grace upon grace Hence I lay down this short but comprehensive view of a t  ue believer in Christ HE IS FRAMED BY GOD'S GRACE AND FORMED FOR HIS GLORY HE LIVES BY FAITH IN DIVINE TRUTHS RELIES ON PRECIOUS PROMISES AND WALKS IN OBEDIENCE TO HOLY COMMANDS "As many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy" Gal vi I cannot conclude without adding the following  CAUTION  Is it so Beware then of that cursed Antinomian licentious antievangelical spirit which so sadly prevails in this day Hence so many professors rest satisfied with a mere notion of a set of doctrines in their  heads without experiencing the love of Christ in their hearts and the power and influence of it over their lives tempers and conversations They talk very highly of the deep things of God shew great zeal for the doctrines of grace and are warm in defending them against error But alas they live very low Instead of striving against sin they make light of it Exercising no godly jealousy over their tempers and passions are not following after holiness nor zealous of good works to please the Lord With all their head knowledge they live under the influence of the same worldly spirit and covetous disposition and exalt the same proud tempers and sinful passions as others do who are destitute of such knowledge Indeed they live as if they thought because they assent to some certain points of doctrine that therefore they are indulged with a dispensation to slight and disregard practical godliness and to look on it as the very essence of  legality  They walk as if they believed God looks on sin in them and their neglect of obedience to the holy precepts and exhortations of the gospel with a more favorable eye than he does upon others Hence though they walk after the flesh and gratify the pride pleasures lusts tempers and passions of the flesh and do not bring forth the fruits of the Spirit nor evidence in their lives the power and purity of the gospel upon their hearts yet they are very confident of the safety of their state now and that all will go well with them at last  Most fatal deception Most dreadful delusion O my brethren e  er remember "the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believeth" Rom i "It bringeth forth fruit in the heart and life of every one who hears it and knows the grace of God in truth" Col i The very end of our being married by faith to a risen Saviour Paul declares is that "we should bring forth fruit unto  God" Rom vii and says our Lord "He who abideth in me bringeth forth much fruit And herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit so ye shall be appear to be my disciples" John xv Judge now where the love of sin prevails in the heart and the power of sin in the life and tempers can such professors be said to have received the gospel of Christ and to experience it to be the power of God unto salvation Where the fruits of the gospel are not brought forth in the lise can the root of the gospel be in such hearts What reason has any one to conclude that he is married to Christ by the faith of the operation of God if he doth not bring forth the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the glory of God What reason has any one to think that he is a disciple of Christ unless from his very heart he finds power from Christ to hate all sin so as studiously to strive against it and so to love holiness as constantly to follow after it None at all Why should any one think that he abides in Christ and Christ in him if he has not the same mind in him which was also in Christ even to walk as Christ also walked in meckness of temper lowliness of heart and obedience of life to the glory of God No one could if he did not deceive his own heart with a vain religion and substitute a dead fancy an empty speculation for a living faith "For wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is dead" James ii And he observes in the th verse "Faith if it hath not works is dead  being alone"  Mind that word  alone  Such a dead faith is destitute of Christ in his grace presence and power of the pardon peace and love of God and of the sanctifying influence comforting and joyful testimony of the Holy Ghost As it is alone in the head it brings none of this blessedness into the heart and therefore it produceth not  the fruits of righteousness nor the works of holiness in the life and conversation  O how many such vain men are there amongst us How is such a dead faith taken up with and rested in by professors without  looking  to Christ who is the life of our souls and the life of our graces  coming  to Christ who is our salvation to be daily saved by him  feeding  upon Christ who is our bread of life to be nourished up unto eternal life and  walking  with Christ who is our sanctification to receive out of his fulness every supply of grace to conform our souls into his image and our lives unto his obedience so as to adorn his gospel and shew forth his praises who hath called us out of nature's darkness into the marvellous light of his precious love and glorious salvation O the depths of satan How does he transform himself into an angel of light so as to deceive souls to be content with the bare  light  of truth in the head without enjoying the  love  of Christ in their hearts and the influence of his gospel upon their lives But such there ever were and such there now are in the visible church to the scandal of the gospel the dishonor of Christ and the grief of his saints Such drew tears from the eyes of aged Paul Says he "Many walk of whom I have often told you and now tell you even weeping that they are enemies to the cross of Christ whose end is destruction whose God is their belly whose glory is their shame who mind earthly things" Phil ii  O methinks I see the holy man of God with a flame of burning zeal for his dear Lord's glory and for the caution and comfort of his real members crying out "My beloved brethren in Christ for your souls sake take heed and beware that you do not catch the spirit and temper and are not infected by the walk and conversation of the  many  who profess to believe in our dear Saviour and to be followers of him but by their lives  and conversation they manifest that they are not reconciled  God by the blood of the cross being averse to the  rucifixion of their lusts pashons and tempers and thereby prove themselves the worst enemies to a crucified Christ and his cause They have no love for Christ delight in nor conformity to him but amidst all their profession their God is their belly Their chief study is to please themselves Gold is their idol and their greatest ambition is to get riches What they ought to be most ashamed of they glory most in Their souls are wholly swallowed up in earthlythings and their time in the pursuit of the enjoyment of them However they may flatter and deceive their souls for a season with the mask of profession it will soon drop off and their end will be destruction  My brethren permit one who through rich grace has escaped as with the skin of his teeth this prevailing delusion of resting in doctrinal notions and empty speculations to apprize you of the evil of this and to warn you against the danger of stopping short of the experience of the life love and power of the grace of Christ and walking in fellowship with him It is this will set our souls free from low and legal bondage and servile slavery to our domineering tempers and lordly passions While we walk in the liberty of Christ in the freedom of the gospel of grace and peace we shall not set at nought but constantly attend to and joyfully obey the precious exhortations of the Spirit in the word And this from the most generous principles the belief of the truth the grace of God and the love of Christ and to the most valuable ends the glory of God the honor of Christ and the adorning of his gospel And say now let precious faith and heavenly love answer Are we not under the most prevailing and powerful obligations to God and Christ thus to live and walk  Consider Hath God so loved us even when in our natural enmity to him and rebellion against him as to give his only begotten Son to redeem and save us Hath he so commended so set forth his love towards us that while we were his enemies and ungodly Christ died for us Doth the gospel proclaim this to us Hath God the Holy Spirit when dead in trespasses and sins quickened our souls to hear and believe this joyful news and to come unto Christ for present pardon peace and justification and to enjoy the lively hope in him of eternal life and glory with him And do we expect soon to be absent from this body of sin and death and to be for ever present with our Lord What conclusion doth generous faith and heavenborn love teach us to make from all this Peter draws a most blessed one for us and which faith love and hope will most joyfully acquiesce in "What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God" Pet iii  But O my brethren in how many instances of their command over their passions and tempers do the very heathens shame us and rise up and condemn us One of them having an entertainment with a large company his servant committing a fault hastily flew into a passion and with great eagerness lifted up his hand in order to strike him but suddenly recollecting himself that he was in the company and presence of wise philosophers he kept his arm lifted up to the utmost stretch This drew their attention to him And one asked What is the matter To which he  eplied Nothing but only by this I am exposing the folly of and punishing an angry man" O let us always remember that we▪ ever live and act in the  sight and presence of the most wise God and our Saviour Jesus Christ Let that be a curb to our tempers and a bridle to our passions  The Lord is at hand Let therefore our moderation of temper and spirit be known unto all men Let our zeal for Christ's honor and glory be our deepest concern Let us be careful for nothing so much as to please him Let us be fearful of nothing so much as to offend him The Lord of all grace make us strong in faith and chearful in love that we may be both willing and able to bring our every evil temper sinful passion and inordinate affection to the foot of his cross and to sacrifice them daily to the glory of him who endured the death of the cross for us The Lord enable us to walk in love even as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling savor The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits  Pardon I beseech you the freedom of this address Reject not any thing
