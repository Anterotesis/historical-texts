Outwitted  ACT I  SCENE I  A street  Enter  Delamour  and  Thady  in travelling dresses meeting Young  Woodville  Young  Woodville  HA  Delamour  welcome from  Paris  my dear friend  embrace  and honest  Thady  how dost do  Tha  Je vous remercies I am bravely sir thank your axing  Del  The sight of my dear  Woodville  in good health gives me infinite pleasure I am well  you see but my heart ah  Woodville  not all the sparkling beauties of the  Louvre  have had power to efface my charming  Emily's  dear dear idea But how does the lovely girlsay is she in town that I may flyha what  Y  Wood  I am extremely sorry that I am oblig'd like your evil genius to meet you with ill news on your arrival but all the consolation I can afford my dear friend is an assurance of my sister's constancyTo keep you no longer in suspensemy father has promis'd her hand to Sir  Geofry Ginkle    Del  Cursed infernal avarice What motive else could have induced the hitherto kindest parent to make a sacrifice of his darling his blooming  Emily  to such an oldBy Heaven I'll go this instant and  Tha  Arrah sir sir your putting yourself into passions and flurries is mighty sillymight silly upon my soulCouggarI'll be bound to put you in a way that you may have your own game with him I'll tell you d'ye see I'll watch this Mr  Gingle  if it's  Gingle  you call him and Manumshandoul if I don't put the speak out of himand then when the old divil is quiet in his grave you may cuckold him as fast as you please Eh sir  turning to  Woodville  wou'dn't there be some fun in that  All this while  Delamour  walks about in great disorder  Y  Wood  What  Thady  sure you would not commit murder  Tha  Murther arrah fat murther an ould son of a whore that has one leg already in the grave and if I trip the other after it is that murther Oh the devil a murther in that sure  Y  Wood  Come come  Delamour  don't be so uneasy your case is not desperate the indissoluble knot is yet to be tied  Del  Happy  Woodville  happy in being conscious you possess my sister's heart unrivall'd free from the harsh injunctions of an obdurate parent to thwart your lovesbut I  Y  Wood  Ah  Delamour  I am no object to be envied and far from having an assurance of  Florimel's  affections happy then indeed should I be but she is still the same gay unthinking lovely witty rogue if in the most unfeign'd rapture I breathe my love the return is a loud laugh an opera tune or a ridiculous simile which faith sometimes makes me look very silly indeed in her more serious moments which are but few she perhaps gives me an hearing when all at once a crowd of gayer thoughts rush on and kill at once the hopes wherewith I was elated a few minutes before  Del  You shall find me a powerful advocate in your cause but excuse me for deviating from the maxims of our modern professors of the law my proceedings in your favour will not be  wholly disinterested you must give me all the assistance in your power to break the measures of your father and Sir  Geofry  but how such a notion enter'd into his doating brain is to me amazing I've often heard him express the utmost abhorrence to matrimony but then when I reflect upon my  Emily  's beauty I can't wonder at his being caught old goat  Y  Wood  Love is far from being the sole motive of Sir  Geofry  's addresses to  Emily  the vain hopes of having an heir of his own begetting to inherit his estate which you know is considerable and to mortify his nephew these are the spurs which prick him on in the road which has hitherto appear'd so dreadful to him I dare say you know this nephew as Sir  Geofry  had no children of his own and intended never to marry he bred him up under his own care placed his chief felicity in having him receive those accomplishments proper for a person who as he was to inherit Sir  Geofry  's estate after his decease probably might make a figure in the great world these accomplishments join'd to a natural fine genius a graceful person and a beneficent courteous disposition gain'd him the esteem of all who knew himHe was the darling of his uncle But in this happy state he following the dictates of love before those of his interest unknown to his uncle espous'd a young lady whose only want was a fortune sufficient to render  her a match suitable for the heir of Sir  Geofry  Tha  Upon my word I commend his notion  Y  Wood  This imprudence of the young gentleman so exasperated the old knight that when he heard of it he swore he should never be a shilling the better for him refus'd to see him and now this unfortunate couple are oblig'd to subsist upon a small patrimony left him by his father in a remote part of  Cornwall  Del  By your account I really pity them and wish with my soul for their sake as well as my own the current of his affections cou'd be turn'd to its former channel  Y  Wood  Oh 'tis the most inflexible positive Curmudgeon you might as soon persuade a  Jewish Rabbi  to turn  Jesuit  Tha  A Rabbit turn Jeshitupon my soul a comical change Howsomever they've very pretty boroughs where we were they call 'em Colleges  Y  Wood  He's so fix'd on the completion of this marriage that to make sure of my father's consent he has offer'd to take  Emily  without a portion there he touch'd the vein my father at first shock'd at such an odd proposition gave his old friend very little encouragement but the mention of no fortune together with Sir  Geofry  's great estate stifled all parental tenderness and he now exerts all his authority to  oblige poor  Emily  to name the day and till then to look upon Sir  Geofry  as a gentleman whom his prudence has destin'd her for a husband You may judge the distress these commands gave her and the conflict she suffers between her aversion to Sir  Geofry  and the consequence of her acquiescence to her father's will  Del  Poor dear girl But cou'd I not get a sight of her  Wood  Oh by no means if my father knew of your arrival 'twould bar all access to your future happiness as he'd oblige her to marry Sir  Geofry  immediately as yet I'll not inform  Emily  you're in town I'll meet you this evening at  Fynmore  's in  Pallmall  where I hope we'll think of some expedients for our mutual advantages adieu dear  Delamour  Del  Farewel you'll not fail Come  Thady  Exit  Delamour  Tha  Sir SirSir I've one favor to beg of your Honor  Wood  Well  Thady  let me hear if it's in my power to do you one you may command me  Tha  I want to know siryou'll pardon my boldnessButSir are you sure she is not  Wood  Am I sure she

long purse has laid a claw over her as well as her mistressOgn I am very fond of  Betty  Wood  Well  Thady  to comfort you I believe Mrs  Betty  has kept both heart and hand for you  Tha  Oh upon my word she loves me well enough oh that the poor devil does  Y  Wood  Farewel honest  Thady  But you must not think of seeing your little  Betty  as 'twould be contrary to your master's interest for any of our family to know he's in town  Tha  Oh never fear sur I'll be bound she shan't know I'm in  London  no no but sur if you'd give your kind love and surreverance to her for me I'd  Y  Wood  Ha ha

obsquese  Exeunt at several doors  SCENE II  A Chamber in Sir  Anthony  's House  Emily  is discovered sitting melancholy  Emily  How cruel is it for fathers to assume so unjust a prerogative as to oblige children to marry who they pleaseBecause they are the means of bringing us into the world they think to be ever after the sole disposers and masters of our inclinations and will make us happy or miserable according to their capricious tempers Ah unkind  Delamour  after repeated vows of inviolable constancy to leave me to the perils I now sufferon the eve of being torn from you for everBut

heart if she'd a good opportunity one comfort he's in  Paris  wou'd to heaven some testy Monsieur wou'd run him through the body  Aside  Emil  What sir am I not worthy of an answer  Sir  Geo  Madam I

for my advice or assistance I wish your ladyship a good morning  Emi  Oh I'll submit to whatever you propose for my freedom  Flo  Ha ha ha I see  Emily  you have not such an aversion to a youthful sprightly gallant but faith you'll be deceiv'd for behold that gay young fellow before you what my dear wou'd you be afraid to venture between a pair of sheets with me you'll find me as harmless a bedfellow as Sir  Geofry  himself  Emi  Dear romantic girl but what can all this tend to  Flor  Can you trust your maid  Betty  if so she'll be necessary  Emi  With my life  Flor  Well then you had better call her to receive her instructions  Emi  Who's there    Enter  Footman  Send  Betty  here  Flor  Now pray don't interrupt me Sir  Geofry  notwithstanding his devoirs to you has an aversion to the sex which by the flattering hopes of an ample revenge upon his nephew  and your beauty  curtsies  has been greatly abated Now I think our only way is to revive that aversion by some very flagrant proofs of your levity  Enter  Betty  How d'ye do Mrs  Betty    Bet  At your ladyship's service me'm  Flor  Now if our petticoat triumvirate does not counterplot and defeat the prudent schemes of our brace of wise grey beards may my doom be to die an old maid but to businessI'll immediately write an anonymous letter to Sir  Geofry  as it were from an unknown friendI'll let him know that the person he designs for his wife is unworthy of that honor by having criminal connection with a certain gentlemanTo corroborate this I'll appoint a time when he may have ocular demonstration of her dishonour he'll immediately fall into his old opinions and receiving this as orthodox fly to the place of appointment Now I've two or three suits of  Delamour  's cloathsone suit remarkably richthese will I put on and at the time appointed which may be some very unseasonable hour will come and be let in by  Betty  Then you shall see me  en cavalier  and you must own a figure less agreeable wou'd create a jealousy in one more proof against deception than your old lover  Emi  Oh my dear  Florimel  the first thing he'll do is certainly to tell my father and I  dread the effects of his rageIn his first transports of fury he'll turn me out of doors then my imaginary shame will be publick No I could not bear to be esteemed what I most abhorAh  Florimel  you have my sincere thanks but I must not cannot think of putting your scheme into execution  Flor  Come come I must use you as a kind nurse would a froward child force you to what's for your goodYou must can and shall carry this inimitable scheme into executionFaith like a poor poet I must praise the productions of my own brain since I can get no other to do itEh Mrs  Betty  what do you think  Bet  Indeed ma'am I think your scheme is  unlimitable  as your ladyship says and I thinks as how if my lady knows what's what she'd stop at nothing to give sir  Geofry a gust  to her  Emi  A disgust you mean  Bet  Yes ma'am and when the truth is afterwards known it will resound to your ladysihp's credit and won't hurt your character no not in the least  Flor  Oh  Emily  'twould be a precious husband  Coughs and mimicks Sir  Geofry  with

very wellSir sir let me tell you you've used me ill in the tenderest point sir and don't think it shall pass with impunityBut sir I see I see thro' the shallow gloss you've given it I see your mean fordid reason for recanting your repentance of the offer you made me of taking my child without a portion there sir is your reason Fye fye fye  Sir  Geo  Ungenetous man to put such an evil construction upon and concealing that which you shall know to your confusion since I've no other means of justification know sir your daughter's a prostitute now sir you know my reason  Delamour  's the man who has dishonoured her I saw him let into this house at two o'clock this morning there's the mandate he obey'd there sir read that perhaps you know your daughter's hand  Delamour  accidentally dropt it out of his pocket and I pick'd it up besides I heard it all from his servant  Sir  Ant  Reads  Come this night exactly at two o'clock and  Betty  will conduct you to the longing arms of  Emily  Oh unhappy girl wretched wretched fatherMy friend forgive me  Sir  Geo  From my soulI knew the effect the knowledge of this unfortunate affair would have on you therefore I intended you should never know a syllable of it from me  Sir  Ant  Here  Going to the wing  here who's there I'll turn the ungracious wretch out of my doors this instant to meet the infamy she deserveswhat to make my house a brothelAs for her seducer I'll  Sir  Geo  No no hear reason get the better of your choler your exposing her in that manner would be wrong quite wrong Give me leave to advise youKeep the whole a secret  even from your servants as for  Betty  she has been her confidant send immediately to  Delamour  found him about a marriage with  Emily  I know his circumstances perfectly as some of his land borders upon mine He has a very pretty estate but a little encumbered owing to some extravagancies incident to young men of his volatile disposition The fortune which I refused with  Emily  will help to clear his estate and pay off his sister  Florimel  's fortune these considerations joined to an innate principle of honour which I never knew him deviate from till now perhaps may influence him to accept of your offer but don't you mention the least knowledge of their intercourseWhat think ye  Sir  Ant  Why I don't know my dear friend you're too good too good indeed and so should I be to follow your adviceBut though she has gone astray yet she is still my childWere I sure he'd cover her shame by marriage with pleasure I'd double her portionBut 'tis most amazingI did not think  Delamour  was return'd from  France  Oh sure if I knew he was in the same kingdom I should have taken better care of her but however I'll send for him immediatelyBut 'tis to no purposea likely thing a young fellow like him would tye himself for life to one he has gained upon such easy terms and as for trusting to his honour the young  fellows of this age use the bare word as an instrument of deception on the weaker sex the practice to them is a mere jest Indeed her fortune I don't know what that may do I won't see her till I try my success with him which is so much the better for her for I don't think but I should dash her brains out were I to see her I'll instantly send to him  Exit  Sir  Geo  Do Well my friend Sir  Anthony  I can't say but you're rightly serv'd for preferring the love of your pelf to the future peace and happiness of your child Zounds what an old blind fool I must be to think of marrying a girl of eighteen as if I did not know the sex perfectlyI that am

gallant 'tis true and here he stands in the circumference of this simple petticoat to hinder a preposterous match between Sir  Geofry  and my dear  Emily  which would render her inevitably miserable I wrote you Sir  Geofry  that anonymous letter to which you gave so much credit and in that suit of cloaths which now my brother wears I personated your imaginary rival dropt the billet of assignation which you found and shew'd Sir  Anthony  These machinations of mine having had such happy effects and as my real motive for deceiving you both proceeded from my eagerness to serve my dear  Emily  I
