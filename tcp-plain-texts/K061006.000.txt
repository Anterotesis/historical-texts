 THE SHORTESTWAY WITH THE DISSENTERS OR PROPOSALS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCII  THE SHORTESTWAY WITH THE DISSENTERS  c  SIR  Roger L'Estrange  tell us a Story in his Collection of Fables of the Cock and the Horses The Cock was gotten to Roost in the Stable among the Horses and there being no Racks or other Conveniencies for him it seems he was forc'd to roost upon the Ground the Horses jostling about for room and putting the Cock in danger of his Life he gives them this grave Advice  Pray Gentlefolks let us stand still for fear we should tread upon one another    THERE are some People in the World who now they are  unpearcht  and reduc'd to an Equality with other People and under strong and very just Apprehensions of being further treated as they deserve begin with  Aesop  'sCock to Preach up Peace and Union and the Christian Duties of Moderation forgetting that when they had the Power in their Hands those Graces were Strangers in their Gates  It is now near Fourteen Years that the Glory and Peace of the purest and most flourishing Church in the World has been Ecclips'd Buffetted and Disturb'd by a sort of Men who God in his Providence has suffer'd to insult over her and bring her down these have been the Days of her Humiliation and Tribulation She has born with an invincible Patience the Reproach of the Wicked and God has at last heard her Prayers and deliver'd her from the Oppression of the Stranger  And now they find their Day is over their Power gone and the Throne of this Nation possest by a Royal  English  True and ever Constant Member of and Friend to the Church of  England  Now they find that they are in danger of the Church of  England  's just Resentments  now they cry out  Peace Ʋnion Forbearance  and  Charity  as if the Church had not too long harbour'd her Enemies under her Wing and nourish'd the viperous Brood till they hiss and fly in the Face of the Mother that cherish'd them  No Gentlemen  the Time of Mercy is past your  Day of Grace is over  you shou'd have practis'd Peace and Moderation and Charity if you expected any your selves  We have heard none of this Lesson for Fourteen Years past We have been huff'd and bully'd with your Act of Tolleration you have told us that you are the  Church establish'd by Law  as well as others have set up your CantingSynagogues at our ChurchDoors and the Church and her Members have been loaded with Reproaches with Oaths Associations Abjurations and what not where has been the Mercy the Forbearance the Charity you have shewn to  tender Consciences of the Church  of  England  that cou'd not take Oaths  as fast as you made 'em  that having sworn Allegiance to their lawful and rightful King cou'd not dispence with that Oath  their King being still alive  and swear to your new  Hodgepodge of a DutchGovernment    These ha' been turn'd out of their Livings and they and their Families left to starve their Estates double Tax'd to carry on a War they had  no Hand in  and you  got nothing by  What Account can you give of the Multitudes you have forc'd to comply against their Consciences with your new  sophistical Politicks  who like the new Converts in  France  Sin because they can't Starve And now the Tables are turn'd upon you you  must not be Persecuted 'tis not a Christian Spirit    You have  Butcher'd  one King  Depos'd  another King and made a  mock King  of a Third and yet you cou'd have the Face to expect to be employ'd and trusted by the Fourth any body that did not know the Temper of your Party wou'd stand amaz'd at the Impudence as well as Folly to think of it  Your Management of your  Dutch Monarch  whom you reduc'd to a meer  King of Cls  is enough to give any future Princes such an Idea of your Principles as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your Clutches and God be thank'd the Queen is out of your Hands knows you and will have a care of you  There is no doubt but the supreme Authority of a Nation has in its self a Power  and a Right to that Power  to execute the Laws upon any Part of that Nation it governs The execution of the known Laws of the Land and that with but a weak and gentle Hand neither was all that the phanatical Party of this Land have ever call'd Persecution this they have magnified to a height that the Sufferings of the  Hugonots  in  France  were not to be compar'd with Now to execute the known Laws of a Nation upon those who transgress them after having first been voluntarily consenting to the making those Laws can never be call'd Persecution but Justice But Justice is always Violence to the Party offending for every Man is Innocent in his own Eyes The first execution of the Laws against Dissenters in  England  was in the Days of King  James  the First and what did it amount to truly the worst they suffer'd was at their own request to let them go to  NewEngland  and erect a new Collony and give them great Privileges Grants and suitable Powers keep them under Protection and defend them against all Invaders and receive no Taxes or Revenue from them This was the cruelty  of the Church of  England  fatal Lenity 'Twas the ruin of that excellent Prince King  Charles  the First Had King  James  sent all the Puritans in  England  away to the  WestIndies  we had been a national unmix'd Church the Church of  England  had been kept undivided and entire  To requite the Lenity of the Father they take up Arms against the Son Conquer Pursue Take Imprison and at last put to Death the anointed of God and Destroy the very Being and Nature of Government setting up a sordid Impostor who had neither Title to Govern nor Understanding to Manage but supplied that want with Power bloody and desperate Councils and Craft without Conscience  Had not King  James  the First witheld the full execution of the Laws had he given them strict Justice he had clear'd the Nation of them and the Consequences had been plain his  Son had never been murther'd by them  nor the Monarchy overwhelm'd 'twas  too much Mercy  shewn them was the ruin of his Posterity and the ruin of the Nation's Peace One would think the Dissenters should not have the Face to believe that we are to be wheedl'd and canted into Peace and Toleration when they know that they  have once requited us with a civil War and once with an intollerable and unrighteous Persecution for our former Civillity  Nay to encourage us to be Easy with them 'tis apparent that they never had the Upperhand of the Church but they treated her with all the Severity with all the Reproach and Contempt as was possible What Peace and what Mercy did they shew the Loyal Gentry of the Church of  England  in the time of their Triumphant Commonwealth How did they put all the Gentry of  England  to ransom whether they were actually in Arms for the King or not making People compound for their Estates and starve their Families How did they treat the Clergy of the Church of  England  sequester'd the Ministers devour'd the Patrimony of the Church and divided the Spoil by sharing the ChurchLands among their Soldiers and turning her Clergy out to starve just such Measure as they have mete shou'd be measur'd to them again  Charity and Love is the known Doctrine of the Church of  England  and 'tis plain she has put it in practice towards the Dissenters even beyond what they ought till she has been wanting to her self and in effect unkind to her  own Sons particularly in the too much Lenity of King  James  the First mentioned before had he so rooted the Puritans from the Face of the Land which he had an opportunity early to ha' done they had not the Power to vex the Church as since they have done  IN the Days of King  Charles  the Second how did the Church reward their bloody Doings with Lenity and Mercy  except the barbarous Regicides of the pretended Court of Justice  not a Soul suffer'd for all the Blood in an unnatural War King  Charles  came in all Mercy and Love cherish'd them preferr'd them employ'd them witheld the rigour of the Law and oftentimes even against the Advice of his Parliament gave them liberty of Conscience and how did they requite him with the villainous Contrivance to Depose and Murther him and his Successor at the  RyePlot    KING  James  as if Mercy was the inherent Quality of the Family began his Reign with unusual Favour to them Nor could their joining with the Duke of  Monmouth  against him move him to do himself Justice upon them but that mistaken  Prince thought to win them by Gentleness and Love proclaim'd an universal Liberty to them and rather discountenanc'd the Church of  England  than them how they requited him all the World knows  THE late Reign is too fresh in the Memory of all the World to need a Comment how under Pretence of joining with the Church in redressing some Grievances they pusht things to that extremity in conjunction with some mistaken Gentlemen as to Depose the late King as if the Grievance of the Nation cou'd not ha' been redress'd but by the absolute ruin of the Prince Here's an Instance of their Temper their Peace and Charity To what height they carried themselves during the Reign of a King of their own how they crope into all Places of Trust and Profit how they insinuated into the Favour of the King and were at first preferr'd to the highest Places in the Nation how they engrost the Ministry and  above all how pitifully they Manag'd  is too plain to need any Remarks  BUT particularly their Mercy and Charity the Spirit of Union they tell us so much of has been remarkable in  Scotland  if any Man wou'd see the Spirit of a Dissenter let him look into  Scotland  there they made an entire Conquest of the Church trampled down the sacred Orders and supprest the Episcopal Government with an absolute and as they suppose irretrievable Victory tho' 'tis possible  they may find themselves mistaken  Now 'twou'd be a very proper Question to ask their  Impudent Advocate the Observator  Pray how much Mercy and Favour did the Members of the Episcopal Church find in  Scotland  from the  Scotch  PresbyterianGovernment and I shall undertake for the Church of  England  that the Dissenters shall still receive as much here tho' they deserve but little  In a small Treatise of the Sufferings of the Episcopal Clergy in  Scotland  'twill appear what Usage they met with how they not only lost their Livings but in several Places were plunder'd and abus'd in their Persons the Ministers that cou'd not conform turn'd out with numerous Families and no Maintenance and hardly Charity enough left to relieve them with  a bit of Bread and the Cruelties of the Party are innumerable and not to be attempted in this short Piece  And now to prevent the distant Cloud which they perceiv'd to hang over their Heads from  England  with a true Presbyterian Policy they put in for  a union of Nations  that  England  might unite their Church with the Kirk of  Scotland  and their Presbyterian Members sit in our House of Commons and their Assembly of  Scotch  canting LongCloaks in our Convocation what might ha' been if our Phanatick WhiggishStatesmen had continu'd God only knows but we hope we are out of fear of that now  'Tis alledg'd by some of the Faction and they began to Bully us with it that if we won't unite with them they will not settle the Crown with us again but when her Majesty dies will chuse a King for themselves  If they won't we must make them and 'tis not the first time we have let them know that we are able The Crowns of these Kingdoms have not so far disowned the right of Succession but they may retrieve it again and if  Scotland  thinks to come off from a Successive to an Elective State of Government  England  has not promised not to assist the right Heir and put them into possession without any regard to their ridiculous Settlements  THESE are the Gentlemen these their ways of treating the Church both at home and abroad Now let us examine the Reasons they pretend to give why we shou'd be favourable to them why we should continue and tollerate them among us  First  THEY are very Numerous they say they are a great Part of the Nation and we cannot suppress them  To this may be answer'd THEY are not so Numerous as the Protestants in  France  and yet the  French  King effectually clear'd the Nation of them at once and we don't find he misses them at home  But I am not of the Opinion they are so Numerous as is pretended their Party is more Numerous than their Persons and those mistaken People of the Church who are misled and deluded by their wheedling Artifices to join with them make their Party the greater but those  will open their Eyes when the Government shall set heartily about the work and come off from them as some Annimals which they say always desert a House when 'tis likely to fall    dly  The more Numerous the more Dangerous and therefore the more need to suppress them and God has suffer'd us to bear them as Goads in our sides for not utterly extinguishing them long ago    dly  If we are to allow them only because we cannot suppress them then it ought to be tryed whether we can or no and I am of Opinion 'tis easy to be done and cou'd prescribe Ways and Means if it were proper but I doubt not but the Government will find effectual Methods for the rooting the Contagion from the Face of this Land  ANOTHER Argument they use which is this That 'tis a time of War and we have need to unite against the common Enemy  WE answer this common Enemy had been no Enemy if they had not made him so he was quiet in peace and no way disturb'd or  encroach'd upon us and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him  But further We make no question but we are able to deal with this common Enemy without their help but why must we unite with them because of the Enemy will they go over to the Enemy if we do not prevent it by a union with them We are very well contented they shou'd and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and the common Enemy too and better without them than with them  Besides if we have a common Enemy there is the more need to be secure against our private Enemies if there is one common Enemy we have the less need to have an Enemy in our Bowels  'Twas a great Argument some People used against suppressing the OldMoney that 'twas a time of War and 'twas too great a Risque for the Nation to run if we shou'd not master it we shou'd be undone and yet the Sequel prov'd the Hazard was not so great but it might be mastered and the Success was answerable The suppressing the Dissenters is not a harder Work nor a Work of less necessity to the Publick  we can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation till the Spirit of Whiggisme Faction and Schism is melted down like the OldMoney  To talk of the Difficulty is to Frighten our selves with Chimaeras and Notions of a Powerful Party which are indeed a Party without Power Difficulties often appear greater at a distance than when they are search'd into with Judgment and distinguish'd from the Vapours and Shadows that attend them  We are not to be frightned with it this Age is wiser than that by all our own Experience  and theire's too  King  Charles  the First had early supprest this Party if he had took more deliberate Measures In short 'tis not worth arguing to talk of their Arms their  Monmouths  and  Shaftsburys  and  Argiles  are gone their  DutchSanctuary  is at an end Heaven has made way for their Destruction and if we do not close with the Divine occasion we are to blame our selves and may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve the Church of  England  by extirpating her implacable Enemies and having let slip the Minute that Heaven presented may experimentally Complain  Post est Occasio Calvo    Here are some popular Objections in the way  As first THE Queen has promis'd them to continue them in their tollerated Liberty and has told us she will be a religious Observer of her Word  WHAT her Majesty will do we cannot help but what as the Head of the Church she ought to do is another Case Her Majesty has promised to Protect and Defend the Church of  England  and if she cannot effectually do that without the Destruction of the Dissenters she must of course dispence with one Promise to comply with another But to answer  this Cavil more effectually  Her Majesty did never promise to maintain the Tolleration to the Destruction of the Church but it is upon supposition that it may be compatible with the well being and safety of the Church which she had declar'd she would take especial Care of Now if these two Interests clash 'tis plain her Majesties Intentions are to Uphold Protect Defend and Establish the Church and this we conceive is impossible  Perhaps it may be said THAT the Church is in no immediate danger from the Dissenters and therefore 'tis time enough But this is a weak Answer  For first IF a Danger be real the Distance of it is no Argument against but rather a Spur to quicken us to prevention lest it be too late hereafter  And dly Here is the Opportunity and the only one perhaps that ever the Church had to secure her self and destroy her Enemies  The Representatives of the Nation have now an Opportunity the Time is come which all good Men ha' wish'd for that the Gentlemen of  England  may serve the Church of  England  now they are protected and encouraged by a Church of  England  Queen  What will ye do for your Sister in the Day that she shall be spoken for    If ever you will establish the best Christian Church in the World  If ever you will suppress the Spirit of Enthusiasm  If ever you will free the Nation from the viperons Brood that have so long suck'd the Blood of their Mother  If you will leave your Posterity free from Faction and Rebellion this is the time  This is the time to pull up this heretical Weed of Sedition that has so long disturb'd the Peace of our Church and poisoned the good Corn  BUT says another Hot and Cold Objector this is renewing Fire and Faggot reviving the Act  De Heret Comburendo  This will be Cruelty in its Nature and Barbarous to all the World  I answer 'TIS Cruelty to kill a Snake or a Toad in cold Blood but the Poyson of their Nature makes it a Charity to our Neighbours to destroy those Creatures not for any personal Injury receiv'd but for prevention not for the Evil they have done but the Evil they may do  Serpents Toads Vipers  c  are noxious to the Body and poison the sensative Life these poyson the Soul corrupt our Posterity ensnare our Children destroy the Vitals of our Happyness  our future Felicity and contaminate the whole Mass  Shall any Law be given to such wild Creatures Some Beasts are for Sport and the Huntsmen give them advantages of Ground but some are knock'd on Head by all possible ways of Violence and Surprize  I do not prescribe Fire and Fagot but a  Scipio  said of  Carthage Dilenda est Carthago  they are to be rooted out of this Nation if ever we will live in Peace serve God or enjoy our own As for the Manner I leave it to those Hands who have a right to execute God's Justice on the Nation's and the Church's Enemies  BUT if we must be frighted from this Justice under the specious Pretences and odious Sense of Cruelty nothing will be effected 'Twill be more Barbarous and Cruel to our own Children and dear Posterity when they shall reproach their Fathers as we do ours and tell us  'You had an Opportunity to root out this cursed Race from the World under the Favour and Protection of a true  English  Queen and out of your foolish Pity you spared them because forsooth you would not be Cruel and  now our Church is supprest and persecuted our Religion trampl'd under Foot our Estates plundred our Persons imprisoned and dragg'd to Jails Gibbets and Scaffolds your sparing this  Amalakite  Race is our Destruction your Mercy to them proves Cruelty to your poor Posterity'  HOW just will such Reflections be when our Posterity shall fall under the merciless Clutches of this uncharitable Generation when our Church shall be swallow'd up in Schism Faction Enthusiasme and Confusion when our Government shall be devolv'd upon Foreigners and our Monarchy dwindled into a Republick  'Twou'd be more rational for us if we must spare this Generation to summon our own to a general Massacre and as we have brought them into the World Free send them out so and not betray them to Destruction by our supine negligence and then cry  it is Mercy    Moses  was a merciful meek Man and yet with what Fury did he run thro' the Camp and cut the Throats of Three and thirty thousand of his dear  Israelites  that were fallen into Idolatry what was the reason 'twas Mercy to the rest  to make these be Examples to prevent the Destruction of the whole Army  How many Millions of future Souls we save from Infection and Delusion if the present Race of poison'd Spirits were purg'd from the Face of the Land  'TIS vain to trifle in this matter the light foolish handling of them by Mulcts Fines  c  'tis their Glory and their Advantage if the Gallows instead of the Counter and the Gallies instead of the Fines were the Reward of going to a Conventicle to preach or hear there wou'd not be so many Sufferers the Spirit of Martyrdom is over they that will go to Church to be chosen Sheriffs and Mayors would go to forty Churches rather than be Hang'd  If one severe Law were made and punctually executed that who ever was found at a Conventicle shou'd be Banished the Nation and the Preacher be Hang'd we shou'd soon see an end of the Tale they wou'd all come to Church and one Age wou'd make us all One again  TO talk of  s  a Month for not coming to the Sacrament and  s per  Week for not coming  to Church this is such a way of converting People as never was known this is felling them a Liberty to transgress for so much Money If it be not a Crime why don't we give them full Licence And if it be no Price ought to compound for the committing it for that is selling a Liberty to People to sin against God and the Government  If it be a Crime of the highest Consequence both against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation the Glory of God the Good of the Church and the Happyness of the Soul let us rank it among capital Offences and let it receive a Punishment in proportion to it  We Hang Men for Trifles and Banish them for things not worth naming but an Offence against God and the Church against the Welfare of the World and the Dignity of Religion shall be bought off for  s  this is such a shame to a Christian Government that 'tis with regret I transmit it to Posterity  IF Men sin against God affront his Ordinances rebell against his Church and disobey the Precepts of their Superiors let them suffer as such capital Crimes deserve so will Religion  on flourish and this divided Nation be once again united  And yet the Title of Barbarous and Cruel will soon be taken off from this Law too I am not supposing that all the Dissenters in  England  shou'd be Hang'd or Banish'd but as in cases of Rebellions and Insurrections if a few of the Ringleaders suffer the Multitude are dismist so a few obstinate People being made Examples there's no doubt but the Severity of the Law would find a stop in the Compliance of the Multitude  To make the reasonableness of this matter out of question and more unanswerably plain let us examine for what it is that this Nation is divided into Parties and Factions and let us see how they can justify a Separation or we of the Church of  England  can justify our bearing the Insults and Inconveniencies of the Party  ONE of their leading Pastors and a Man of as much Learning as most among them in his Answer to a Pamphlet entituled  A Enquiry into the occasional Conformity  hath these Words P  Do the Religion of the Church and the Meetinghouses make two Religions Wherein  do they differ The Substance of the same Religion is common to them both and the Modes and Accidents are the things in which only they differ  P  Thirty nine Articles are given us for the summary of our Religion Thirty six contain the Substance of it wherein we agree Three the additional Appendices about which we have some differences    Now if as by their own acknowledgment the Church of  England  is a true Church and the Difference between them is only a few  Modes and Accidents  Why shou'd we expect that they will suffer Gallows and Gallies corporeal Punishment and Banishment for these Trifles there is no question but they will be wiser even their own Principles won't bear them out in it they will certainly comply with the Laws and with Reason and tho' at the first Severity may seem hard the next Age will feel nothing of it the Contagion will be rooted out the Disease being cur'd there will be no need of the Operation but if they should venture to trangress and fall into the Pit all the World must condemn their Obstinacy as being without Ground from their own Principles  Thus the Pretence of Cruelty will be taken off and the Party actually supprest and the Disquiets they have so often brought upon the Nation prevented  THEIR Numbers and their Wealth makes them Haughty and tha tis so far from being an Argument to perswade us to forbear them that 'tis a Warning to us without any more delay to reconcile them to the Unity of the Church or remove them from us  AT present Heaven be prais'd they are not so Formidable as they have been and 'tis our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so Providence and the Church of  England  seems to join in this particular that now the Destroyers of the Nations Peace may be overturn'd and to this end the present Opportunity seems to be put into our Hands  To this end her present Majesty seems reserv'd to enjoy the Crown that the Ecclesiastick as well as Civil Rights of the Nation may be restor'd by her Hand  To this end the Face of Affairs have receiv'd such a Turn in the process of a few Months as never has been before the leading Men of the Nation the universal Cry of the People the unanimous Request of the Clergy agree in this that the Deliverance of our Church is at hand  For this end has Providence given us such a Parliament such a Convocation such a Gentry and such a Queen as we never had before  AND what may be the Consequences of a Neglect of such Opportunities The Succession of the Crown has but a dark Prospect another  Dutch  Turn may make the Hopes of it ridiculous and the Practice impossible Be the House of our future Princes never so well inclin'd they will be Foreigners and many Years will be spent in suiting the Genius of Strangers to the Crown and to the Interests of the Nation and how many Ages it may be before the  English  Throne be fill'd with so much Zeal and Candour so much Tenderness and hearty Affection to the Church as we see it now cover'd with who can imagine  'Tis high time then for the Friends of the Church of  England  to think of Building up  and Establishing her in such a manner that she may be no more Invaded by Foreigners nor Divided by Factions Schisms and Error  IF this cou'd be done by gentle and easy Methods I shou'd be glad but the Wound is coroded the Vitals begin to mortifie and nothing but Amputation of Members can compleat the Cure▪ all the ways of Tenderness and Compassion all perswasive Arguments have been made use of in vain  THE Humour of the Dissenters has so encreas'd among the People that they hold the Church in Defiance and the House of God is an Abomination among them Nay they have brought up their Posterity in such prepossest Aversions to our Holy Religion that the ignorant Mob think we are all Idolaters and Worshippers of  Baal  and account it a Sin to come within the Walls of our Churches  The primitive Christians were not more shie of a HeathenTemple or of Meat offer'd to Idols nor the  Jews  of Swine'sFlesh than some of our Dissenters are of the Church and the Divine Service solemnized therein  THIS Obstinacy must be rooted out with the Profession of it while the Generation are left at liberty daily to affront God Almighty and Dishonour his Holy Worship we are wanting in our Duty to God and our Mother the Church of  England    How can we answer it to God to the Church and to our Posterity to leave them entangled with Fanaticisme Error and Obstinacy in the Bowels of the Nation to leave them an Enemy in their Streets that in time may involve them in the same Crimes and endanger the utter Extirpation of Religion in the Nation  WHAT's the Difference betwixt this and being subjected to the Power of the Church of  Rome  from whence we have reform'd If one be an extreme on one Hand and one on another 'tis equally destructive to the Truth to have Errors settled among us let them be of what Nature they will  Both are Enemies of our Church and of our Peace and why shou'd it not be as criminal to admit an Enthusiast as a Jesuit Why shou'd the  Papist  with his Seven Sacraments be worse than the  Quaker  with no Sacraments at all  Why shou'd Religioushouses be more intollerable than Meetinghouses  Alas the Church of England  What with Popery on one Hand and Schismaticks on the other how has she been Crucify'd between two Thieves  Now  let us Crucifie the Thieves  Let her Foundations be establish'd upon the Destruction of her Enemies The Doors of Mercy being always open to the returning Part of the deluded People Let the Obstinate be rul'd with the Rod of Iron  Let all true Sons of so Holy an Oppressed Mother exasperated by her Afflictions harden their Hearts against those who have oppress'd her  And may God Almighty put it into the Hearts of all the Friends of Truth to lift up a Standard against Pride and Antichrist that the Posterity of the Sons of Error may be rooted out from the Face of this Land for ever  FINIS
