 AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY  Price  s    d    AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY IN FIVE EPISTLES TO THE REV  D  M  R  MASON WITH NOTES  Vatibus addere calcar  Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem  HOR  BY WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DODSLEY IN PALLMALL MDCCLXXXII  EPISTLE THE FIRST  ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  IntroductionDesign of the Poem to remove prejudices which obstruct the cultivation of Epic writingOrigin of PoetryHonors paid to its infancyHomer the first Poet remainingDifficulty of the question why he had no Successor in GreeceRemark of a celebrated Writer that as Criticism flourishes Poetry declines Defence of CriticsDanger of a bigoted acquiescence in critical Systemsand of a Poet's criticising his own worksAdvantages of Friendship and study of the higher Poets  EPISTLE I  PERISH that critic pride which oft has hurl'd  Its empty thunders o'er the Epic world  Which eager to extend its mimic reign  Would bind free Fancy in a servile chain  With papal rage the eye of Genius blind  And bar the gates of Glory on the mind  Such dark decrees have letter'd Bigots penn'd  Ver See NOTE I    Yet seiz'd that honor'd name the Poet's Friend  But Learning from her page their laws will blot  Scorn'd be their arrogance their name forgot  Th' indignant Bard abhorring base controul  Seeks the just Critic of congenial soul  Say MASON Judge and Master of the Lyre  Harmonious Chief of Britain's living Choir  Say wilt Thou listen to his weaker strains  Who pants to range round Fancy's rich domains  To vindicate her empire and disown  Proud System seated on her injur'd throne  Come while thy Muse contented with applause  Gives to her graceful song a little pause  Enjoying triumphs past at leisure laid  In thy sweet Garden's variegated shade  Or fondly hanging on some favorite Oak  That Harp whose notes the fate of Mona spoke  Strung by the sacred Druid's social band  And wisely trusted to thy kindred hand  Come for thy liberal and ingenuous heart  Can aid a Brother in this magic art  Let us and Freedom be our guide explore  The highest province of poetic lore  Free the young Bard from that oppressive awe  Which feels Opinion's rule as Reason's law  And from his spirit bid vain fears depart  Of weaken'd Nature and exhausted Art  Phantoms that literary spleen conceives  Dullness adopts and Indolence believes  While with advent'rous step we wind along  Th' expansive regions of Heroic song  From different sources let our search explain  Why few the Chieftains of this wide domain  Haply inspiriting poetic youth  Our verse may prove this animating truth  That Poesy's sublime neglected field  May still new laurels to Ambition yield  Her Epic trumpet in a modern hand  Still make the spirit glow the heart expand  Be such our doctrine our enlivening aim  The Muse's honor and our Country's fame  Thou first and fairest of the social Arts  Sovereign of liberal souls and feeling hearts  If in devotion to thy heavenly charms  I clasp'd thy altar with my infant arms  For thee neglected the wide field of wealth  The toils of int'rest and the sports of health  Enchanting Poesy that zeal repay  With powers to sing thy universal sway  To trace thy progress from thy distant birth  Heaven's pure descendant dear delight of Earth  Charm of all regions to no age confin'd  The prime ennobler of th' aspiring mind  Nor will thy dignity sweet Power disdain  What Fiction utters in her idle strain  Thy sportive Friend who mocking solemn Truth  Tells her fond tales of thy untutor'd youth  As wrong'd Latona so her tale begins  To Delphos travell'd with her youthful twins  Th' envenom'd Python with terrific sway  Cross'd the fair Goddess in her destin'd way  The heavenly parent in the wild alarm  Her little Dian in her anxious arm  High on a stone which she in terror trod  Cried to her filial guard the Archer God  Bidding with force that spoke the Mother's heart  Her young Apollo launch his ready dart  In measur'd sounds her rapid mandate flow'd  The first foundation of the future Ode  Thus at their banquets fabling Greeks rehearse  Ver See NOTE II  The fancied origin of sacred Verse  And though cold Reason may with scorn assail  Or turn contemptuous from their simple tale  Yet Poesy thy sister Art may stoop  From this weak sketch to paint th' impassion'd group  Though taste refin'd to modern Verse deny  The hacknied pageants of the Pagan sky  Their sinking radiance still the Canvass warms  Painting still glories in their graceful forms  Nor canst thou envy if the world agree  To grant thy Sister claims denied to thee  For thee the happier Art the elderborn  Superior rights and dearer charms adorn  Confin'd she catches with observance keen  Her single moment of the changeful scene  But thou endu'd with energy sublime  Unquestion'd arbiter of space and time  Canst join the distant the unknown create  And while Existence yields thee all her state  On the astonish'd mind profusely pour  Myriads of forms that Fancy must adore  Yet of thy boundless power the dearest part  Is firm possession of the feeling Heart  No progeny of Chance by Labor taught  No slowform'd creature of scholastic thought  The child of Passion thou thy lyre she strung  To her parental notes she tun'd thy tongue  Gave thee her boldest swell her softest tone  And made the compass of her voice thy own  To Admiration source of joy refin'd  Chaste lovely mover of the simple mind  To her though sceptics in their pride declaim  With many an insult on her injur'd name  To her sweet Poesy we owe thy birth  Thou first encomiast of the fruitful Earth  By her inspir'd the earliest mortal found  The eardelighting charm of measur'd sound  He hail'd the Maker of a world so fair  And the first accent of his song was prayer  O most attractive of those airy Powers  Who most illuminate Man's chequer'd hours  Is there an Art in all the group divine  Whose dawn of Being must not yield to thine  Religion's self whose provident controul  Takes from fierce Man his anarchy of soul  She o'er thy youth with fond affection hung  And borrow'd music from thy infant tongue  Law sterner Law whose potent voice imprest  Severest terror on the human breast  With thy fresh flow'rs her aweful figure crown'd  And spoke her mandate in thy foster found  E'en cold Philosophy whom later days  Saw thy mean rival envious of thy praise  Who clos'd against thee her ungrateful arms  And urg'd her Plato to defame thy charms  She from thy childhood gain'd no fruitless aid  From thee she learnt her talent to persuade  Gay Nature view'd thee with a smiling glance  The Graces round thee fram'd the frolic dance  And well might festive Joy thy favor court  Thy song turn'd strife to peace and toil to sport  Exhausted Vigor at thy voice reviv'd  And Mirth from thee her dearest charm deriv'd  Triumphant Love in thy alliance blest  Enlarg'd his empire o'er the gentle breast  His torch assum'd new lustre from thy breath  And his clear flame defied the clouds of death  But of the splendid train who felt thy sway  Or drew existence from thy vital ray  Glory with fondest zeal proclaim'd thy might  And hail'd thee victor of oblivious Night  Her martial trumpet to thy hand she gave  At once to quicken and reward the Brave  It soundshis blood the kindling Hero pays  A cheap and ready price for thy eternal praise  Tho' selfish Fear th' immortal strain deride  And mock the Warrior's wish as frantic pride  Ye gallant hapless Dead of distant time  Whose fame has perish'd unembalm'd in rhyme  As thro' the desert air your ashes fly  In Fancy's ear the nameless atoms cry  "To us unhappy cruel Fates refuse  "The wellearn'd record of th' applauding Muse"  Blest are those Chiefs who blazon'd on her roll  Still waken virtue in each kindred soul  Their bright existence still on earth prolong  And shine for ever in the deathless song  Yet oft Oblivion in a treacherous shade  Has sunk the tuneful rites to Valor paid  Her palsied lips refusing to rehearse  The sacred old traditionary verse  As well the curious eye with keen desire  Might hope to catch that spark of vital fire  Which first thro' Chaos shot a sudden light  And quicken'd Nature in its transient flight  As the fond ear to catch the fleeting note  Which on the ravish'd air was heard to float  When first the Muse her Epic strain began  And every list'ning Chief grew more than Man  But as the Ruler of the newborn day  From Chaos rose in glory's rich array  So from deep shades impenetrably strong  That shroud the darken'd world of antient song  Bright HOMER bursts magnificently clear  The solar Lord of that poetic sphere  Before whose blaze in wide luxuriance spread  Each Grecian star hides his diminish'd head  Whose beams departed yet enchant the sight  In Latium's softer chaste reflected light  Say ye whose curious philosophic eye  Searches the depth where Nature's secrets lie  Ye who can tell how her capricious fit  Directs the flow and ebb of human wit  And why obedient to her quick command  Springtides of Genius now enrich her fav'rite land  Now sink by her to different climes assign'd  And only leave some worthless weeds behind  Say why in Greece unrival'd and alone  The Sovereign Poet grac'd his Epic throne  Why did the realm that echoed his renown  Produce no kindred heir to claim his crown  If as the liberal mind delights to think  Fancy's rich flow'rs their vital essence drink  From Liberty's pure streams that largely roll  Their quick'ning virtue thro' the Poet's soul  Why in the period when this Friend of Earth  Made Greece the model of heroic worth  And saw her votaries act beneath her sway  Scenes more sublime than Fiction can display  Why did the Epic Muse's silent lyre  Ver See NOTE III  Shrink from those feats that summon'd all her fire  Or if as courtly Theorists maintain  The Muses revel in a Monarch's reign  Why when young Ammon's soul athirst for fame  Call'd every Art to celebrate his name  When ready Painting at his sovereign nod  With aweful thunder arm'd this mimic God  Why did coy Poesy tho' fondly woo'd  Refuse that dearer smile for which he sued  And see him shed in martial Honor's bloom  The tear of envy on Achilles' tomb  In vain would Reason those nice questions solve  Which the fine play of mental powers involve  In Bards of ancient time with genius fraught  What mind can trace how thought engender'd thought  How little hints awak'd the large design  And subtle Fancy spun her variegated line  Yet sober Critics of no vulgar note  But such as Learning's sons are proud to quote  The progress of Homeric verse explain  As if their souls had lodg'd in Homer's brain  Laughs not the spirit of poetic frame  However slightly warm'd by Fancy's flame  When grave Bossu by System's studied laws  Ver See NOTE IV  The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws  And wisely tells us that his Song arose  As the good Parson's quiet Sermon grows  Who while his easy thoughts no pressure find  From hosts of images that croud the mind  First calmly settles on some moral text  Then creepsfrom one divisionto the next  Nor if poetic minds more slowly drudge  Thro' the cold comments of this Gallic judge  Will their indignant spirit less deride  That subtle Pedant's more presumptive pride  Whose bloated page with arrogance replete  Imputes to VIRGIL his own dark conceit  Ver See NOTE V  And from the tortur'd Poet dares to draw  That latent sense which HORACE never saw  Which if on solid proof more strongly built  Must brand the injur'd Bard with impious guilt  While such Dictators their vain efforts waste  In the dark visions of distemper'd Taste  Let us that pleasing happier light pursue  Which beams benignant from the milder few  Who justly conscious of the doubts that start  In all nice questions on each finer Art  With modest doubt assign each likely cause  But dare to dictate no decisive laws  'Tis said by one who with this candid claim  Ver See NOTE VI  Has gain'd no fading wreath of Critic fame  Who fondly list'ning to her various rhyme  Has mark'd the Muse's step thro' many a clime  That where the settled Rules of Writing spread  Where Learning's code of Critic Law is read  Tho' other treasures deck th' enlighten'd shore  The germs of Fancy ripen there no more  Are Critics then that bold imperious tribe  The Guards of Genius who his path prescribe  Are they like Visirs in an Eastern court  Who sap the very power they should support  Whose specious wiles the royal mind unnerve  And sink the monarch they pretend to serve  No of their value higher far I deem  And prize their useful toil with fond esteem  When LOWTH's firm spirit leads him to explore  The hallow'd confines of Hebraic lore  When his free pages luminous and bold  The glorious end of Poesy unfold  Assert her powers her dignity defend  And speak her as she is fair Freedom's friend  When thus he shines his mitred Peers above  I view his warmth with reverential love  Proud if my verse may catch reflected light  From the rich splendor of a mind so bright  Blest be the names to no vain system tied  Who render Learning's blaze an useful guide  A friendly beacon rais'd on high to teach  The wand'ring bark to shun the shallow beach  But O ye noble and aspiring few  Whose ardent souls poetic fame pursue  Ye on whom smiling Heaven perfection's source  Seems to bestow unlimitable force  The inborn vigor of your souls defend  Nor lean too fondly on the firmest friend  Genius may sink on Criticism's breast  By weak dependance on her truth opprest  Sleep on her lap and stretch his lifeless length  Shorn by her soothing hand of all his strength  Thou wilt not MASON thou whose generous heart  Must feel that Freedom is the soul of Art  Thou wilt not hold me arrogant or vain  If I advise the young poetic train  To deem infallible no Critic's word  Not e'en the dictates of thy Attic HURD  No not the Stagyrite's unquestion'd page  The Sire of Critics sanctified by age  The noblest minds with solid reason blest  Who feel that faculty above the rest  Who argue on those arts they never try  Exalt that Reason they so oft apply  Till in its pride with tyrannous controul  It crush the kindred talents of the soul  And hence in every Art will systems rise  Which Fancy must survey with angry eyes  And at the lightning of her scornful smile  In frequent ruin sinks the labor'd pile  How oft my ROMNEY have I known thy vein  Swell with indignant heat and gen'rous pain  To hear in terms both arrogant and tame  Some reas'ning Pedant on thy Art declaim  Its laws and limits when his sovereign taste  With firm precision has minutely trac'd  And in the close of a decisive speech  Pronounc'd some point beyond the Pencil's reach  How has thy Genius by one rapid stroke  Refuted all the sapient things he spoke  Thy Canvass placing in the clearest light  His own Impossible before his sight  O might the Bard who loves thy mental fire  Who to thy fame attun'd his early lyre  Learn from thy Genius when dull Fops decide  So to refute their systematic pride  Let him at least succeeding Poets warn  To view the Pedant's lore with doubt or scorn  And e'en to question with a spirit free  Establish'd Critics of the first degree  Among the names that Judgment loves to praise  The pride of ancient or of modern days  What Laws of Poesy can Learning shew  Above the Critic song of sage DESPREAUX  His fancy elegant his judgment nice  His method easy and his style concise  The Bard of Reason with her vigor fraught  Her purest doctrine he divinely taught  Nor taught in vain His precept clear and chaste  Reform'd the errors of corrupted Taste  And French Imagination who was bit  By that Tarantula distorted Wit  Ceasing her antic gambols to rehearse  Blest the pure magic of his healing verse  With his loud fame applauding Europe rung  And his just praise a rival Poet sung  Yet had this Friend of Versedevoted Youth  This tuneful Teacher of Poetic truth  Had he but chanc'd his doctrine to diffuse  Ere Milton commun'd with his sacred Muse  And could that English selfdependant soul  Born with such energy as mocks controul  Could his high spirit with submissive awe  Have stoop'd to listen to a Gallic Law  His hallow'd subject by that Law forbid  Ver See NOTE VII    Might still have laid in silent darkness hid  And this bright Sun not rising in our sphere  HOMER had wanted still his true compeer  From hence let Genius to himself be just  Hence learn ye Bards a liberal distrust  Whene'er 'tis said by System's haughty Son  That what He cannot do can ne'er be done  'Tis Fancy's right th' exalted throne to press  Whose height proud System can but blindly guess  Springs whose existence she denies unlock  And call rich torrents from the flinty rock  Let the true Poet who would build a name  In noble rivalship of antient fame  When he would plan to triumph over Time  The splendid fabric of his lofty rhyme  Let him the pride of Constantine assume  Th' imperial Founder of the second Rome  Who scorn'd all limits to his work assign'd  Ver See NOTE VIII  Save by th' inspiring God who rul'd his mind  Or like the fabled  Jupiter ut perhibent spatium quum discere vellet  Naturae regni nescius ipse sui  Armigeros utrimque duos aequalibus alis  Misit ab Eois Occiduisque plagis  Parnassus geminos fertur junxisse volatus  Contulit alternas Pythius axis aves  CLAUDIAN  Jove to ascertain  The doubtful confines of his wide domain  Two Eagles let him send of equal wing  Whose different flight may form a perfect ring  And at the point where Sense and Fancy meet  There safely bold and though sublime discreet  His fame's foundation let him firmly lay  Nor dread the danger of disputed sway  Yet if the Bard to glory must aspire  By free exertion of unborrow'd fire  Nor like the Classic Bigot vainly deem  No modern Muse can challenge just esteem  Unless her robe in every fold be prest  To fall precisely like the Grecian vest  If the blind notion he must boldly shun  That Beauty's countless forms are only one  And not when Fancy from her magic hoard  Would blindly bring him treasures unexplor'd  Snap her light wand and force her hand to bear  The heavier Compass and the formal Square  Let him no less their dangerous pride decline  Who singly criticise their own design  In that nice toil what various perils lurk  Not Pride alone may mar the needful work  But foes more common to the feeling nerve  Where Taste and Genius dwell with coy Reserve  The sickly Doubt with modest weakness fraught  The languid Tedium of o'erlabour'd thought  The Pain to feel the growing work behind  The finish'd model in the forming mind  These foes that oft the Poet's bosom pierce  These that condemn'd to fire Virgilian Verse  Prove that the Bard a bold yet trembling elf  Should find a Critic firmer than himself  But what fine Spirit will assume the Judge  Patient thro' all this irksome toil to drudge  'Tis here O Friendship here thy glories shine  The hard th' important task is only thine  For thou alone canst all the powers unite  That justly make it thy peculiar right  Thine the fixt eye which at no foible winks  Thine the warm zeal which utters all it thinks  In those sweet tones that hasty Spleen disarm  That give to painful Truth a winning charm  And the quick hand of list'ning Genius teach  To grasp that excellence he burns to reach  Thou sweet Subduer of all mental strife  Thou Source of vigor thou Support of life  Nor Art nor Science could delight or live  Without that energy thy counsels give  Genius himself must sink in dumb despair  Unblest uncherish'd by thy cheering care  Nor let the Bard elate with youthful fire  When Fancy to his hand presents the lyre  When her strong plumes his soaring spirit lift  When Friendship Heaven's more high and holy gift  With zeal angelic prompts his daring flight  And round him darts her doubtdispelling light  Let him not then by Vanity betray'd  Look with unjust contempt on Learning's aid  But as th' advent'rous Seaman to attain  That bright renown which great Discoverers gain  Consults the conduct of each gallant name  Who sail'd before him in that chace of Fame  Reviews with frequent glance their useful chart  Marks all their aims and fathoms all their art  So let the Poet trace  their  happy course  So bravely emulate  their  mental force  Whose daring souls from many a different clime  Have nobly ventur'd on the sea of Rhyme  Led by no fear his swelling sail to slack  Let him with eager eyes pursue the track  Not like a Pirate with insidious views  To plunder every vessel he pursues  But with just hope to find yet farther shores  And pass each rival he almost adores  END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE SECOND  ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE  Character of Ancient PoetsHomerApollonius Rhodius VirgilLucan  EPISTLE II  HAIL mighty Father of the Epic line  Thou vast prolific intellectual Mine  Where veins of ancient and of modern gold  The wealth of each poetic world have roll'd  Great Bard of Greece whose everduring Verse  All ages venerate all tongues rehearse  Could blind idolatry be justly paid  To aught of mental power by man display'd  To thee thou Sire of soulexalting Song  That boundless worship might to thee belong  For as thy Jove on his Olympian throne  In his unrivall'd sway exults alone  Commanding Nature by his aweful nod  In high seclusion from each humbler God  So shines thy Genius thro' the cloud of years  Exalted far above thy Pagan peers  By the rich splendor of creative fire  And the deep thunder of thy martial lyre  The conscious world confesses thy controul  And hails thee Sovereign of the kindling soul  Yet could thy mortal shape revisit earth  How would it move great Bard thy scornful mirth  To hear vain Pedants to thy Verse assign  Scholastic thoughts that never could be thine  To hear the quaint conceits of modern Pride  Blaspheme thy Fancy and thy Taste deride  When thus in Vanity's capricious fit  We see thy fame traduc'd by Gallic wit  Ver See NOTE I  We see a Dwarf who dares his foot to rest  On a recumbent Giant's ample chest  And lifting his pert form to public sight  Boasts like a child his own superior height  But neither envious Wit's malignant craft  Tho' arm'd with Ridicule's envenom'd shaft  Nor fickle Fashion's more tyrannic sway  Whose varying voice the sons of Earth obey  Can shake the solid base of thy renown  Or blast the verdure of thy Laurel crown  Tho' Time who from his manycolour'd wings  Scatters ten thousand shades o'er human things  Has wrought unnumber'd changes since thy birth  And given new features to the face of earth  Tho' all thy Gods who shook the starry pole  Unquestion'd Rulers of the Pagan soul  Are fallen with their fanes in ruin hurl'd  Their worship vanish'd from th' enlighten'd world  Still its immortal force thy Song retains  Still rules obedient man and fires his glowing veins  For Nature's self that great and constant power  One and the same thro' every changing hour  Gave thee each secret of her reign to pierce  And stampt her signet on thy sacred Verse  That aweful signet whose imperial sway  No age disputes no regions disobey  For at its sight the subject passions start  And open all the passes of the heart  'Twas Nature taught thy Genius to display  That host of Characters who grace thy lay  So richly varied and so vast the store  Her plastic hand can hardly model more  'Twas Nature noblest of poetic Guides  Gave thee thy flowing Verse whose copious tides  Gushing luxuriant from high Fancy's source  By no vain art diverted in their course  With splendid ease with simple grandeur roll  Spread their free wealth and fertilize the soul  There are whom blind and erring zeal betrays  To wound thy Genius with illjudging praise  Who rashly deem thee of all Arts the sire  Who draw dull smoke from thy resplendent fire  Pretend thy fancied Miracles to pierce  And form quaint riddles of thy clearest Verse  Blind to those brighter charms and purer worth  Which make thy Lays the lasting joy of earth  For why has every age with fond acclaim  Swell'd the loud note of thy increasing fame  Not that cold Study may from thee deduce  Vain codes of mystic lore and laws abstruse  But that thy Song presents like solar light  A world in action to th' enraptur'd sight  That with a force beyond th' enervate rules  Of tame Philosophy's pedantic Schools  Thy living Images instruct mankind  Mould the just heart and fire th' heroic mind  E'en SOCRATES himself that purest Sage  Ver See NOTE II  Imbib'd his Wisdom from thy moral page  And haply Greece the Wonder of the Earth  For feats of martial fire and civic worth  That glorious Land of noblest minds the nurse  Owes her unrivall'd race to thy inspiring Verse  For O what Greek who in his youthful vein  Had felt thy soulinvigorating strain  Who that had caught amid the festive throng  The public lesson of thy patriot Song  Could ever cease to feel his bosom swell  With zeal to dare and passion to excel  In thee thy grateful country justly prais'd  The noblest Teacher of the tribes she rais'd  Thy voice which doubly gave her fame to last  Form'd future Heroes while it sung the past  What deep regret thy fond admirers feel  That mythologic clouds thy life conceal  That like a distant God thou'rt darkly shewn  Felt in thy Works but in Thyself unknown  Perchance the shades that hide thy mortal days  From keen Affection's disappointed gaze  And that Idolatry so fondly proud  With which thy Country to thy genius bow'd  Might form the cause why kindling with thy fire  No Grecian rival struck thy Epic lyre  Perchance not seeing how thy steps were train'd  How they the summit of Parnassus gain'd  On thy oppressive Glory's flaming pride  Young Emulation gaz'd and gazing died  The Muses of the Attic Stage impart  To many a Votary their kindred art  And she who bids the Theban Eagle bear  Her lyric thunder thro' the stormy air  How high soe'er she leads his daring flight  Ver See NOTE III  Guides his bold rivals to an equal height  Of all the Grecian Bards in Glory's race  'Tis thine alone by thy unequall'd pace  To reach the goal with loud applause and hear  No step approaching thine no rival near  Yet may not Judgment with severe disdain  Slight the young RHODIAN's variegated strain  Ver See NOTE IV  Tho' with less force he strike an humbler shell  Beneath his hand the notes of Passion swell  His tender Genius with alluring art  Displays the tumult of the Virgin's heart  When Love like quivering rays that never rest  Darts thro' each vein and vibrates in her breast  Tho' Nature feel his Verse tho' she declare  Medea's magic is still potent there  Yet Fancy sees the slighted Poet rove  In pensive anger thro' th' Elysian Grove  From Critic shades whose supercilious pride  His Song neglected or his Powers decried  He turns indignantunopprest by fears  Behold he seeks the sentence of his Peers  See their just band his honest claim allow  See pleasure lighten on his laurell'd brow  He soars the Critic's cold contempt above  For VIRGIL greets him with fraternal love  Hail thou rich Column on whose highwrought frame  The Roman Muse supports her Epic fame  Hail great Magician whose illusive charms  Gave pleasing lustre to a Tyrant's arms  To Jove's pure sceptre turn'd his iron rod  And made the Homicide a Guardian God  Hail wond'rous Bard to Glory's temple led  Thro' paths that Genius rarely deigns to tread  For Imitation she whose syren song  Betrays the skillful and unnerves the strong  Preserving thee on her perfidious shore  Where many a Poet had been wreck'd before  Led thee to heights that charm th' astonish'd eye  And with Invention's heaven in splendor vie  As Rome herself by long unwearied toil  Glean'd the fair produce of each foreign soil  From all her wide Dominion's various parts  Borrow'd their laws their usages their arts  Imported knowledge from each adverse zone  And made the wisdom of the world her own  Thy patient spirit thus from every Bard  Whose mental riches won thy just regard  Drew various treasure which thy skill refin'd  And in the fabric of thy Verse combin'd  It was thy glory as thy fond desire  To echo the sweet notes of HOMER's lyre  But with an art thy hand alone can reach  An art that has endear'd the strain of each  So the young Nymph whose tender arms embrace  An elder Sister of enchanting grace  Though form'd herself with every power to please  By genuine character and native ease  Yet fondly copies from her favourite Fair  Her mien her motion her attractive air  Her robe's nice shape her riband's pleasing hue  And every ornament that strikes the view  But she displays by imitative art  So quick a spirit and so soft a heart  The graceful mimic while our eyes adore  We think the model cannot charm us more  Tho' seen together each more lovely shews  And by comparison their beauty grows  Some Critics to decide which Bard prevails  Weigh them like Jove but not in golden scales  In their false balance th' injur'd GREEK they raise  VIRGIL sinks loaded with their heavy praise  Ver See NOTE V  Ingenuous Bard whose mental rays divine  Shaded by modest doubts more sweetly shine  Thou whose last breath unconscious of the wrong  Doom'd to destruction thy sublimest Song  How dull their incense in thy sight must burn  How must thy spirit with abhorrence turn  From their disgusting rites who at thy shrine  Blaspheme thy Master's name to honor thine  More equal tribute in their simpler flowers  The Poets offer to your separate powers  For all poetic eyes delight to view  Your different forms and with devotion due  In each the radiant Delphic God they own  By beauteous majesty distinctly shewn  But they behold the lofty HOMER stand  The bright Colossus of the Rhodian land  Beneath whose feet the waves submissive roll  Whose towering head appears to prop the pole  Stupendous Image grand in every part  And seeming far above the reach of mortal art  In thee thou lovely Mantuan Bard appear  The softer features of the Belvidere  That finish'd grace which fascinates all eyes  Yet from the copying hand elusive flies  Charms so complete by such pure spirit warm'd  They make less perfect beauty seem deform'd  O had thy Muse whose decorating skill  Could spread rich foliage o'er the leafless hill  Had she who knew with nicest hand to frame  The sweet unperishable wreaths of Fame  Had she exalted by a happier fate  Virtue's free Herald and no Slave of State  Deck'd worthier shrines with her unfading flower  And given to Freedom what she gave to Power  Then with more keen delight and warmer praise  The world had listen'd to thy bolder lays  Perchance had ow'd to thee a mighty debt  Verse where Perfection her bright seal had set  Where Art could nothing blame and Nature nought regret  Of coarser form with less pathetic charms  Hating with Stoic pride a Tyrant's arms  In the keen fervor of that florid time  When youthful Fancy pours her hasty rhyme  When all the mind's luxuriant shoots appear  Untrimm'd by Art by Interest or Fear  See daring LUCAN for that wreath contend  Which Freedom twines for her poetic friend  'Tis thine thou bold but injur'd Bard 'tis thine  Tho' Critic spleen insult thy rougher line  Tho' wrong'd thy Genius and thy Name misplac'd  By vain distinctions of fastidious Taste  Indignant Freedom with just anger fir'd  Shall guard the Poet whom herself inspir'd  What tho' thy early uncorrected page  Betrays some marks of a degenerate age  Tho' many a tumid point thy verse contains  Like warts projecting from Herculean veins  Tho' like thy CATO thy stern Muse appear  Her manners rigid and her frown austere  Like him still breathing Freedom's genuine flame  Justice her idol Public Good her aim  Well she supplies her want of softer art  By all the sterling treasures of the heart  By Energy from Independance caught  And the free Vigor of unborrow'd Thought  Thou Bard most injur'd by malicious fate  Could not thy Blood appease a Tyrant's hate  Must He still gall'd by thy poetic claim  With falshood persecute thy moral fame  Shall History's pen to aid his vengeance won  Ver See NOTE VI  Brand thee brave Spirit as an impious Son  Who meanly fear'd to yield his vital flood  And sought his safety by a Parent's blood  Base calumny at which Belief must halt  And blind Credulity herself revolt  Could that firm Youth become so vile a slave  Whose voice new energy to virtue gave  Whose Stoic soul all abject thoughts abhorr'd  And own'd no sordid passion as its lord  Who in the trying hour of mortal pain  While life was ebbing from his open vein  Alike unconscious of Remorse and Fear  His heart unshaken and his senses clear  Smil'd on his doom and like the fabled bird  Whose music on Meander's bank was heard  Form'd into tuneful notes his parting breath  And sung th' approaches of undreaded death  Rise thou wrong'd Bard above Detraction's reach  Whose arts in vain thy various worth impeach  Enjoy that fame thy spirit knew to prize  And view'd so fondly with prophetic eyes  Tho' the nice Critic of fastidious France  Survey thy Song with many a scornful glance  And as a Goth the kinder judge accuse  Who with their great CORNEILLE commends thy Muse  Let Britain eager as the Lesbian state  To shield thy Pompey from the wrongs of Fate  To thee with pride a fond attachment shew  Thou Bard of Freedom tho' the world's thy foe  As keenly sensible of Beauty's sway  Let our just isle such generous honor pay  To the fair partner of thy hapless life  As Lesbos paid to Pompey's lovely Wife  Ver See NOTE VII  Ye feeling Painters who with genius warm  Delineate Virtue in her softest form  Let ARGENTARIA on your canvass shine  Ver See NOTE VIII  A graceful mourner at her Poet's shrine  For nobly fearless of the Tyrant's hate  She mourns her murder'd Bard in solemn state  With pious care she decks his splendid tomb  Where the dark Cypress sheds its soothing gloom  There frequent takes her solitary stand  His dear Pharsalia in her faithful hand  That hand whose toil the Muses still rehearse  Which fondly copied his unfinish'd Verse  See as she bends before his recent urn  See tender Grief to Adoration turn  O lovely Mourner could my Song bestow  Unfading glory on thy generous woe  Age after age thy virtue should record  And thou should'st live immortal as thy Lord  Him Liberty shall crown with endless praise  True to her cause in Rome's degenerate days  Him like his Brutus her fond eye regards  And hails him as the last of Roman Bards  END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE THIRD  ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD EPISTLE  Sketch of the Northern and the Provençal PoetryThe most distinguished Epic Poets of Italy Spain Portugal France and England  EPISTLE III  BLEST be the hand that with a generous care  To the bright Crown which Learning loves to wear  Restores the Gem whose lustre faint and pale  Died in the fold of dark Oblivion's veil  Such praise O MASON to the Bard is due  In whose fraternal guard thy Genius grew  O'er whose untimely grave thy Lyre has paid  Its just devotion to a Brother's shade  And thus hereafter shall the British Muse  In Memory's fane the fairest tablet chuse  To bid her sons your blended names admire  The pride of Friendship's as of Fancy's choir  Thy modest GRAY solicitous to pierce  The dark and distant source of modern Verse  By strings untried first taught his English Lyre  To reach the Gothic Harp's terrific fire  The North's wild spectres own his potent hand  And Hell's nine portals at his voice expand  With new existence by his Verse endued  See Gothic Fable wakes her shadowy brood  Which in the Runic rhymes of many a  Scald  With pleasing dread our Northern sires appall'd  Ye brave Progenitors ye vigorous Source  Of modern Freedom and of Europe's force  While your rude minds athirst for martial strife  Mock'd all the meaner arts of polish'd life  The Muse still led you by her magic clue  And from your savage strength new vigor drew  In War's dire field your dauntless Bards appear'd  Alost their animating harps they rear'd  Pour'd through the charging host their potent strain  And swell'd the fiery flood in Valor's vein  Souls thus inspir'd in every scene elate  Defied the utmost rage of adverse fate  In tort'ring death the Royal Captive sang  And smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang  Ver See NOTE I  Thus to brave ODIN's Songs our Northern sire  Rude early framer of the modern Lyre  Fierce Freedom gave an energy sublime  Parent and Guardian of the Gothic Rhyme  While nurtur'd in the North's protecting arms  The modern Muse display'd her infant charms  Like Jove's undaunted Child her spirit glow'd  And force Herculean in her cradle shew'd  Her native scene in roughness she surpast  Her breath tempestuous as the Northern blast  But when to softer climes the vagrant flew  And bask'd beneath a sky of azure hue  When for her throne the flowery South she chose  And form'd her crown of the Provençal Rose  Warm'd by a brighter Sun's relaxing beams  She tun'd her alter'd voice to tender themes  Here her gay form a gaudier dress assumes  And shines in Chivalry's imperial plumes  Her votaries wear proud Honor's mystic glove  And every lyre resounds Romantic Love  Save when to burst Oppression's mental chain  Keen Satire mingles with this gallant train  Strikes Priestly pride with Wit's vindictive flash  And galls the ghostly Tyrant with her lash  Ver See NOTE II  Afraid of Poesy's expansive flood  These early Bards along the shallows feud  In some light skiff for on the depths untried  No fulltrimm'd vessel floats in Epic pride  As infants eager for regard abound  In sportive efforts of uncertain sound  Before their little artless lips can reach  The harder elements of perfect speech  So the young language of each modern clime  Rose by prelusive lays to lofty rhyme  Thro' many an age while in the Convent bred  O'er the chill'd mind scholastic darkness spread  Those keener Spirits who from Nature caught  The warmth that kindles to Poetic thought  Betray'd Ambition by thy blind desire  Struck with illfated zeal the Latian lyre  Ver See NOTE III  Tho' Discord's hand the jarring strings had crost  And all the sweetness of their tone was lost  At length fair Italy luxuriant land  Where Art's rich flowers in earliest bloom expand  Thy daring DANTE his wild Vision sung  Ver See NOTE IV  And rais'd to Epic pomp his native Tongue  Down Arno's stream his newform'd music floats  The proud vale echoing with his Tuscan notes  See the bold Bard now sink and now ascend  Wherever Thought can pierce or Life extend  In his wide circuit from Hell's drear abyss  Thro' purifying scenes to realms of perfect bliss  He seems begirt with all that airy throng  Who brighten or debase the Poet's song  Sublimest Fancy now directs his march  To opening worlds through that infernal arch  O'er whose rough summit aweful words are read  That freeze each entering soul with hopeless dread  Now at her bidding his strong numbers flow  And rend the heart at Ugolino's woe  While Nature's glorygiving tear bedews  A tale unrivall'd by the Grecian Muse  Now to those notes that milder grief inspire  Pathetic Tenderness attunes his lyre  Which soft as murmurs of the plaintive dove  Tells the sad issue of illicit love  But all the worse companions of his way  Soon into different sounds his ductile voice betray  Satiric Fury now appears his guide  Thro' thorny paths of Enmity and Pride  Now quaint Conceit his wand'ring steps misleads  Thro' all the hideous forms that Folly breeds  Now Priestly Dullness the lost Bard enshrouds  In cold confusion and scholastic clouds  Unequal Spirit in thy various strain  With all their influence Light and Darkness reign  In thy strange Verse and wayward Theme alike  New forms of Beauty and Disorder strike  Extremes of Harmony and Discord dwell  The Seraph's music and the Demon's yell  The patient Reader to thy merit just  With transport glows and shudders with disgust  Thy Failings sprung from thy disastrous time  Thy stronger Beauties from a soul sublime  Whose vigor burst like the volcano's flame  From central darkness to the sphere of fame  Of gentler mind and with a heart to feel  The fondest warmth of emulative zeal  Thy festive Scholar who ador'd thy Lays  And grac'd thy Genius with no scanty praise  The gay BOCCACIO tempts th' Italian Muse  Ver See NOTE V  More varied notes and different themes to chuse  Themes which her voice had dar'd not yet to sound  Valour's heroic feats by Beauty crown'd  Sweet was the glowing Song but strange to tell  On his bold lyre Oblivion's shadows fell  His richer Tales engross'd the World's regard  And the bright Novelist eclips'd the Bard  In following ages when Italia's shore  Blaz'd with the rising light of Classic lore  Stern System led from her newfounded school  A Poet fashion'd by her rigid rule  Behold my Son his sapient Tut'ress cried  Who throws the bonds of Gothic rhyme aside  For whom these hands the Grecian Lyre new strung  She spoke exulting and TRISSINO sung  Ver See NOTE VI  In his cold Verse he kept her Critic laws  While Pedants own'd their pow'r and yawn'd applause  Indignant Fancy who with scorn survey'd  The sleepy honors to proud System paid  Smiling to see that on her rival's brow  The Poppy lurk'd beneath the Laurel bough  Resolv'd in sportive triumph to display  The rich extent of her superior sway  From Necromancy's hand in happiest hour  She caught the rod of visionary power  And as aloft the magic wand she rais'd  A peerless Bard with new effulgence blaz'd  Born every law of System to disown  And rule by Fancy's boundless power alone  High in mid air between the Moon and Earth  The Bard of Pathos now and now of Mirth  Pois'd with his lyre between a Griffin's wings  Her sportive darling ARIOSTO sings  As the light cloud whose varying vapors fly  Driven by the zephyr of the evening sky  Fixes and charms the neverwearied view  By taking every shape and every hue  So by Variety's supreme controul  His changeful numbers seize the willing soul  Enchanted by his Song Attention sits  With features catching every cast by fits  Like the fond infant in whose tender brain  Young Sensibility delights to reign  While rapid Joy and Pain each other chase  Thro' the soft muscles of its April face  In vain the slaves of System would discard  From Glory's classic train this airy Bard  Delighted Nature her gay fav'rite crown'd  And Envy's clamour in her plaudit drown'd  Severe Morality to censure mov'd  His wanton Lyre with juster blame reprov'd  But his sweet Song her anger so beguil'd  That ere she finish'd her reproof she smil'd  Of chaster fire a rival name succeeds  Whose bold and glowing hand Religion leads  In solemn accent and in sacred state  With classic lore and Christian zeal elate  Sweetly pathetic and sublimely strong  TASSO begins his more majestic song  The Muse of Sion not implor'd in vain  Guides to th' impassion'd soul his heavenly strain  Blush BOILEAU blush and for that pride atone  Which slander'd Genius far above thy own  And thou great injur'd Bard thy station claim  Amid the Demigods of Epic name  Heir to a mantle by the Muses spun  Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son  Ver See NOTE VII  Nor tho' just Fame her richer palm devote  To the highsounding lyre of serious note  Shall gay TASSONI want his festive crown  Ver See NOTE VIII  Who banish'd from the Muse her aweful frown  And tuning to light themes her lofty style  O'er her grave features spread a comic smile  Such various Sons of Epic fire possest  Italia foster'd on her feeling breast  Spain whose bold genius with misjudging pride  O'ersteps true glory by too large a stride  Claims higher merit from one Poet's birth  Who rivals all the different Bards of earth  With more than Niobe's parental boast  She calls her single Son himself an Host  And rashly judges that her VEGA's lyre  Ver See NOTE IX  Is equal to the whole Aonian quire  Impetuous Poet whose full brain supplied  Such floods of Verse and in so quick a tide  Their rapid swell by its unrivall'd height  Pleas'd yet produc'd more wonder than delight  Tho' thy free rhyme from Fancy's fountain gush  And with the grandeur of the torrent rush  Its troubled streams in dark disorder roam  With all the torrent's noise and all its foam  To Emulation fir'd by TASSO's strain  Thy spirit quitted the dramatic plain  To seek those Epic heights sublimely calm  Whence he had pluck'd his Idumean palm  But vainly struggling in a task too hard  Sunk at the feet of that superior Bard  Brave Spaniard still thy wounded pride console  Time shall not strike thy name from Glory's roll  On which thy generous and fraternal hand  Emblaz'd each brother of thy tuneful band  Thy Muse shall share the praise she joy'd to give  And while thy language lasts thy fame shall live  Perchance tho' strange the paradox may seem  That fame had risen with a brighter beam  Had radiant Fancy less enrich'd thy mind  Her lavish wealth for wiser use design'd  Ruin'd the Poet by its splendid lure  As India's mines have made his country poor  With warmth more temperate and in notes more clear  That with Homeric richness fill the ear  The brave ERCILLA sounds with potent breath  Ver See NOTE X  His Epic trumpet in the fields of death  In scenes of savage war when Spain unfurl'd  Her bloody banners o'er the western world  With all his Country's virtues in his frame  Without the base alloy that stain'd her name  In Danger's camp this military Bard  Whom Cynthia saw on his nocturnal guard  Recorded in his bold descriptive lay  The various fortune of the finish'd day  Seizing the pen while Night's calm hours afford  A transient slumber to his satiate sword  With noble justice his warm hand bestows  The meed of Honor on his valiant foes  Howe'er precluded by his generous aim  From high pretensions to inventive fame  His stronglycolour'd scenes of sanguine strife  His softer pictures caught from Indian life  Above the visionary forms of art  Fire the awaken'd mind and melt the heart  Tho' fiercest tribes her galling fetters drag  Proud Spain must strike to Lusitania's flag  Whose ampler folds in conscious triumph spread  Wave o'er her NAVAL POET's laureate head  Ye Nymphs of Tagus from your golden cell  That caught the echo of his tuneful shell  Rise and to deck your darling's shrine provide  The richest treasures that the deep may hide  From every land let grateful Commerce shower  Her tribute to the Bard who sung her power  As those rich gales from whence his GAMA caught  A pleasing earnest of the prize he sought  The balmy fragrance of the East dispense  So steals his Song on the delighted sense  Astonishing with sweets unknown before  Those who ne'er tasted but of classic lore  Immortal Bard thy name with GAMA vies  Thou like thy Hero with propitious skies  The sail of bold adventure hast unfurl'd  And in the Epic ocean found a world  'Twas thine to blend the Eagle and the Dove  At once the Bard of Glory and of Love  Ver See NOTE XI  Thy thankless Country heard thy varying lyre  To PETRARCH's Softness melt and swell to HOMER's Fire  Boast and lament ungrateful land a Name  In life in death thy honor and thy shame  Thou nobler realm whom vanity betrays  To load thy letter'd sons with lavish praise  Where Eulogy with one eternal smile  Ver See NOTE XII  Heaps her faint roses in a withering pile  A City milkmaid on the first of May  Who pertly civil and absurdly gay  Forms her dull garland in fantastic state  With illadjusted flow'rs and borrow'd plate  Canst thou selfflattering France with justice vaunt  One Epic laurel as thy native plant  How oft a Gallic hand with childish fire  Has rattled Discord on th' heroic lyre  While their dull aid associate Critics bring  And vainly teach the use of every string  In Morals as with many an empty boast  They practise virtue least who preach it most  So haughty Gallia in thy Epic school  No great Examples rise but many a Rule  Ver See NOTE XIII  Yet tho' unjust to TASSO's nobler lays  Keen BOILEAU shall not want his proper praise  Ver See NOTE XIV  He archly waving his satiric rod  Thro' the new path which first TASSONI trod  Pursued his sportive march in happy hour  And pluck'd from Satire's thorn a festive flower  His sacerdotal War shall wake delight  And smiles in Gravity herself excite  While Canons live to quarrel or to feast  And gall can tinge the spirit of a Priest  Nor gentle GRESSET shall thy sprightly rhyme  Ver See NOTE XV  Cease to enchant the list'ning ear of Time  In thee the Graces all their powers instill  To touch the Epic chords with playful skill  The hapless Parrot whom thy lays endear  In piety and woe the Trojan's peer  His heart as tender and his love more pure  Shall like Aeneas live of fame secure  While female hands with many a tender word  Stroke the soft feathers of their fav'rite bird  Yet not in childish sport or trifling joy  Do Gallic Fairones all their hours employ  See lovely BOCCAGE in ambition strong  Ver See NOTE XVI  Build with aspiring aim her Epic Song  By Glory fir'd her rosy lips rehearse  Thy feats Columbus in unborrow'd Verse  If this new Muse in War's dire field displays  No Grecian splendor no Homeric blaze  Attractive still tho' not in pomp array'd  She charms like Zama in her Verse portray'd  Whose form from dress no gorgeous pride assumes  Clad in a simple zone of azure plumes  England's dear guest this Muse of Gallia caught  From our inspiring Isle her ardent thought  Here first she strove to reach with vent'rous hope  MILTON's chaste grandeur and the grace of POPE  And sweetly taught in her mimetic strain  The Songs of Britain to the Banks of Seine  But see with wounded Pride's indignant glance  The angry Genius of presuming France  From ancient shrines their Epic wreaths would tear  To swell the glory of her great VOLTAIRE  Ver See NOTE XVII  O form'd in Learning's various paths to shine  Encircled from thy birth by all the Nine  On thee blest Bard these rivals seem'd to shower  Their various attributes and blended power  But when their lofty leader bade thee frame  The rich Heroic song on Henry's fame  Sarcastic Humour trifling with her lyre  Took from th' inspiring Muse her solemn fire  No more her spirit like the Eagle springs  Or rides the buoyant air with balanc'd wings  Tho' rapid still to narrow circuits bound  She like the darting Swallow skims the ground  Thy Verse displays beneath an Epic name  Wit's flinty Spark for Fancy's solar Flame  While yet thy hand the Epic chords embrac'd  With playful spirit and with frolic haste  Such lively sounds thy rapid fingers drew  And thro' the festive notes so lightly flew  Nature and Fancy join'd their charms to swell  And laughing Humour crown'd thy new Pucelle  But the chaste Muses startled at the sound  Amid thy sprightly numbers blush'd and frown'd  With decent anger and becoming pride  Severer Virtue threw the Song aside  While Justice own'd it with a kinder glance  The wittiest Levity of wanton France  Now graver Britain amiably severe  To thee with native zeal to thee I steer  My vent'rous bark its foreign circuit o'er  Exulting springs to thy parental shore  Thou gorgeous Queen who on thy silvery coast  Sittest encircled by a filial host  And seest thy sons the jewels of thy crown  Blaze with each varying ray of rich renown  If with just love I hold their Genius dear  Lament their hardships and their fame revere  O bid thy Epic Muse with honor due  Range her departed Champions in my view  See on a partycolour'd steed of fire  With Humour at his side his trusty Squire  Gay CHAUCER leadsin form a Knight of old  And his strong armour is of steel and gold  But o'er it age a cruel rust has spread  And made the brilliant metals dark as lead  Now gentle SPENSER Fancy's fav'rite Bard  Awakes my wonder and my fond regard  Encircling Fairies bear in sportive dance  His adamantine shield and magic lance  While Allegory drest with mystic art  Appears his Guide but promising to dart  A lambent glory round her list'ning Son  She hides him in the web herself has spun  Ingenuous COWLEY the fond dupe of Wit  Seems like a vapour o'er the field to flit  In David's praise he strikes some Epic notes  But soon down Lethe's stream their dying murmur floats  While COWLEY vanish'd in an amorous riddle  Up rose the frolic Bard of Bear and Fiddle  His smile exhilarates the sullen earth  Adorning Satire in the mask of Mirth  Taught by his Song Fanatics cease their jars  And wise Astrologers renounce the Stars  Unrivall'd BUTLER blest with happy skill  To heal by comic verse each serious ill  By Wit's strong flashes Reason's light dispense  And laugh a frantic nation into sense  Apart and on a sacred hill retir'd  Beyond all mortal inspiration fir'd  The mighty MILTON sitsan host around  Of list'ning Angels guard the holy ground  Amaz'd they see a human form aspire  To grasp with daring hand a Seraph's lyre  Inly irradiate with celestial beams  Attempt those high those soulsubduing themes  Which humbler Denizens of Heaven decline  And celebrate with sanctity divine  The starry field from warring Angels won  And GOD triumphant in his Victor Son  Nor less the wonder and the sweet delight  His milder scenes and softer notes excite  When at his bidding Eden's blooming grove  Breathes the rich sweets of Innocence and Love  With such pure joy as our Forefather knew  When Raphael heavenly guest first met his view  And our glad Sire within his blissful bower  Drank the pure converse of th' aetherial Power  Round the blest Bard his raptur'd audience throng  And feel their souls imparadis'd in song  Of humbler mien but not of mortal race  Illfated DRYDEN with Imperial grace  Gives to th' obedient lyre his rapid laws  Tones yet unheard with touch divine he draws  The melting fall the rising swell sublime  And all the magic of melodious rhyme  See with proud joy Imagination spread  A wreath of honor round his aged head  But two base Spectres tho' of different hue  The Bard unhappy in his march pursue  Two vile disgraceful Fiends of race accurst  Conceiv'd by Spleen by meagre Famine nurst  Malignant Satire mercenary Praise  Shed their dark spots on his immortal bays  Poor DAVENANT march'd before with nobler aim  His keen eye fixt upon the palm of Fame  But cruel Fortune doom'd him to rehearse  A Theme illchosen in illchosen Verse  Next came Sir RICHARD but in woeful plight  DRYDEN's Ledhorse first threw the luckless Knight  He rose advent'rous stillO who may count  How oft he tried a different Steed to mount  Each angry steed his awkward rider flung  Undaunted still he fell and falling sung  But Aesculapius who with grief distrest  Beheld his offspring made a public jest  Soon bade a livelier Son with mirth efface  The shame he suffer'd from Sir RICHARD's case  Swift at the word his sprightly GARTH began  To make an  And his high helmet was a Closestool Pan DISPENSARY  helmet of a Closestool Pan  An Urinal he

'Tis POPE who sweetly wakes the silver lyre  To melting notes more musically clear  Than Ariel whisper'd in Belinda's ear  Too soon he quits them for a sharper tone  See him tho' form'd to fill the

growth to bear  Shall not thy vot'ries glow with just disdain  When Sloth or Spleen thy bounteous hand arraign  Art thou the Niggard they pretend thou art  A grudging Parent with a stepdame's heart  And dost thou shed with rare reluctant toil  Bright Fancy's germins in the mental soil  Is Genius thy sweet Plant of richest power  Whose dearly priz'd and longexpected flower  More tardy than the Aloe's bloom appears  Ordain'd to blow but in a thousand years  Perish the sickly thoughtlet those who hold  Thy quick'ning influence so coy so cold  Calmly the habitable earth survey  From time's first aera to the passing day  In what rude clime beneath what angry skies  Have plants Poetic never dar'd to rise  In torrid regions where 'tis toil to think  Where souls in stupid ease supinely sink  And where the native of the desert drear  Yields to blank darkness half his icy year  In these unfriendly scenes where each extreme  Of heat and cold forbids the mind to teem  Poetic blossoms into Being start  Spontaneous produce of the feeling heart  Can we then deem that in those happier lands  Where every vital energy expands  Where Thought the golden harvest of the mind  Springs into rich luxuriance unconfin'd  That in such soils with mental weeds o'ergrown  The Seeds of Poesy were thinly sown  Shall we deny the labor of the swain  Who to the cultur'd earth confides the grain  If all the vagrant harpies of the air  From its new bed the pregnant treasure tear  If when scarce rising with a stem infirm  It dies the victim of the mining worm  If mildew riding in the eastern gust  Turns all its ripening gold to sable dust  These foes combin'd and with them who may cope  Are not more hostile to the Farmer's hope  Than Life's keen passions to that lighter grain  Of Fancy scatter'd o'er the infant brain  Pleasure the rambling Bird the painted Jay  May snatch the richest seeds of Verse away  Or Indolence the worm that winds with art  Thro' the close texture of the cleanest heart  May if they haply have begun to shoot  With partial mischief wound the sick'ning root  Or Avarice the mildew of the soul  May sweep the mental field and blight the whole  Nay the meek errors of the modest mind  To its own vigor diffidently blind  And that cold spleen which falsely has declar'd  The powers of Nature and of Art impair'd  The gate that Genius has unclos'd may guard  And rivet to the earth the rising Bard  For who will quit tho' from mean aims exempt  The cares that summon and the joys that tempt  In many a lonely studious hour to try  Where latent springs of Poesy may lie  Who will from social ease his mind divorce  To prove in Art's wide field its secret force  If blind to Nature's frank parental love  He deems that Verse descended from above  Like Heaven's more sacred signs whose time is o'er  A gift miraculous conferr'd no more  O Prejudice thou bane of Arts thou pest  Whose russian powers the freeborn soul arrest  Thou who dethroning Reason dar'st to frame  And issue thy proud laws beneath her name  Thou Coaster on the intellectual deep  Ordering each timid bark thy course to keep  Who lest some daring mind beyond thee steer  Hast rais'd to vouch thy vanity and fear  Herculean pillars where thy sail was furl'd  And nam'd thy bounds the Limits of the World  Thou braggart Prejudice how oft thy breath  Has doom'd young Genius to the shades of death  How often has thy voice with brutal fire  Forbidding Female hands to touch the lyre  Deny'd to Woman Nature's fav'rite child  The right to enter Fancy's opening wild  Blest be this smiling hour when Britain sees  Her Fairones cancel such absurd decrees  In one harmonious group with graceful scorn  Spring o'er the Pedant's fence of wither'd thorn  And reach Parnassian heights where laurelcrown'd  This softer Quire the notes of triumph sound  Where SEWARD leader of the lovely train  Pours o'er heroic tombs her potent strain  Potent to sooth the honor'd dead and dart  Congenial virtue thro' each panting heart  Potent thro' spirits masculine to spread  Poetic jealousy and envious dread  If Love and Envy could in union rest  And rule with blended sway a Poet's breast  The Bards of Britain with unjaundic'd eyes  Will glory to behold such rivals rise  Proceed ye Sisters of the tuneful Shell  Ver See NOTE I  Without a scruple in that Art excel  Which reigns by virtuous Pleasurers soft controul  In sweet accordance with the Female soul  Pure as yourselves and like your charms design'd  To bless the earth and humanize mankind  Where'er that Parent of engaging thought  Warm Sensibility like light has taught  The bright'ning mirror of the mind to shew  Nature's reflected forms in all their glow  Where in full tides the fine affections roll  And the warm

idol of his glowing heart  "Tears from his Harp the vain detested wires  "And in the frenzy of Despair expires  "Pernicious Poesy thy baleful sway  "Exalts to weaken flatters to betray  "When thy sond

thus warns the filial heart  From this alluring this insidious Art  But wounded thus by keen Invective's edge  Say can the Muse no just defence alledge  In striking contrast has she not to paint  Her prosp'rous Hero as her murder'd Saint  'Tis true she oft has fruitless vigils kept  And oft with unavailing sorrow wept  Her injur'd Vot'ries doom'd to quit the earth  In the sharp pangs of

Her splendid stores to worthier hands entrust  For with the purest current wide and strong  His Charity surpast his copious Song  If the Enthusiast higher hope pursues  If from his commerce with th'

flames with Epic rage  Unhurt by poverty unchill'd by age  Tho' danger threaten his declining day  Tho' clouds of darkness quench his visual ray  The heavenly Muse his hallow'd spirit fills  With raptures that surmount his matchless ills  From earth she bears him to bright Fancy's goal  And distant fame illuminates his soul  Too oft the wealthy to proud follies born  Have turn'd from letter'd Poverty with scorn  Dull Opulence thy narrow joys enlarge  To shield weak Merit is thy noblest charge  Search the dark scenes where drooping Genius lies  And keep from sorriest sights a nation's eyes  That from expiring Want's reproaches free  Our generous country may ne'er weep to see  A future CHATTERTON by poison dead  An OTWAY fainting for a little bread  If deaths like these deform'd our native isle  Some English Bards have bask'd in Fortune's smile  Alike in Station and in Genius blest  By Knowledge prais'd by Dignity carest  POPE's happy Freedom all base wants above  Flow'd from the golden stream of Public Love  That richest antidote the Bard can seize  To save his spirit from its worst disease  From mean Dependance bright Ambition's bane  Which blushing Fancy strives to hide in vain  To POPE the titled Patron joy'd to bend  Still more ennobled when proclaim'd his friend  For him the hands of jarring Faction join  To keep their tribute on his HOMER's shrine  Proud of the frank reward his talents find  And nobly conscious of no venal mind  With the just world his fair account he clears  And owns no debt to Princes or to Peers  Yet while our nation feels new thirst arise  For that pure joy which Poesy supplies  Bards whom the tempting Muse enlists by stealth  Perceive their path is not the road to wealth  To honorable wealth young Labor's spoil  The due reward of no inglorious toil  Whose wellearn'd comforts noblest minds engage  The just asylum of declining age  Else had we seen a warm Poetic Youth  Change Fiction's roses for the thorns of Truth  From Fancy's realm his native field withdraw  To pay hard homage to severer Law  O thou bright Spirit whom the Asian Muse  Had fondly steep'd in all her fragrant dews  And o'er whose early Song that mental feast  She breath'd the sweetness of the rifled East  Since independant Honor's high controul  Detach'd from Poesy thy ardent soul  To seek with better hopes Persuasion's seat  Blest be those hopes and happy that retreat  Which with regret all British Bards must see  And mourn a Brother lost in losing thee  Nor leads the Poet's path to that throng'd gate  Where crouching Priests on proud Preferment wait  Where while in vain a thousand vot'ries fawn  She robes her fav'rite few in hallow'd Lawn  Else liberal MASON had thy spotless name  The Ward of Virtue as the Heir of Fame  In lists of mitred Lords been still unread  While Mitres drop on many a Critic's head  Peace to all such whose decent brows may bear  Those sacred honors plac'd by Learning there  May just respect from brutal insult guard  Their Crown unenvied by the genuine Bard  Let Poesy embellish'd by thy care  Pathetic MASON with just pride declare  Thy breast must feel a more exulting fire  Than Pomp can give or Dignity inspire  When Nature tells thee that thy Verse imparts  The thrill of pleasure to ten thousand hearts  And often has she heard ingenuous Youth  Accomplish'd Beauty and unbiass'd Truth  Those faithful harbingers of future fame  With tender interest pronounce thy name  With lively gratitude for joy refin'd  Gift of thy Genius to the feeling mind  These are the honors which the Muse confers  The radiant Crown of living light is her's  And on thy brow she gave those gems to blaze  That far outshine the Mitre's transient rays  Gems that shall mock malignant Envy's breath  And shine still brighter thro' the shades of death  For me who feel whene'er I touch the lyre  My talents sink below my proud desire  Who often doubt and sometimes credit give  When Friends assure me that my Verse will live  Whom health too tender for the bustling throng  Led into pensive shade and soothing song  Whatever fortune my unpolish'd rhymes  May meet in present or in future times  Let the blest Art my grateful thoughts employ  Which sooths my sorrow and augments my joy  Whence lonely Peace and social Pleasure springs  And Friendship dearer than the smile of Kings  While keener Poets querulously proud  Lament the Ills of Poesy aloud  And magnify with Irritation's zeal  Those common evils we too strongly feel  The envious Comment and the subtle Style  Of specious Slander stabbing with a smile  Frankly I wish to make her Blessings known  And think those Blessings for her Ills atone  Nor wou'd my honest pride that praise forego  Which makes Malignity yet more my foe  If heartfelt pain e'er led me to accuse  The dangerous gift of the alluring Muse  'Twas in the moment when my Verse imprest  Some anxious feelings on a Mother's breast  O thou fond Spirit who with pride hast smil'd  And frown'd with fear on thy poetic child  Pleas'd yet alarm'd when in his boyish time  He sigh'd in numbers or he laugh'd in rhyme  While thy kind cautions warn'd him to beware  Of Penury the Bard's perpetual snare  Marking the early temper of his soul  Careless of wealth nor fit for base controul  Thou tender Saint to whom he owes much more  Than ever Child to Parent ow'd before  In life's first season when the fever's flame  Shrunk to deformity his shrivell'd frame  And turn'd each fairer image in his brain  To blank confusion and her crazy train  'Twas thine with constant love thro' ling'ring years  To bathe thy Idiot Orphan in thy tears  Day after day and night succeeding night  To turn incessant to the hideous sight  And frequent watch if haply at thy view  Departed Reason might not dawn anew  Tho' medicinal art with pitying care  Cou'd lend no aid to save thee from despair  Thy fond maternal heart adher'd to Hope and Prayer  Nor pray'd in vain thy child from Pow'rs above  Receiv'd the sense to feel and bless thy love  O might he thence receive the happy skill  And force proportion'd to his ardent will  With Truth's unfading radiance to emblaze  Thy virtues worthy of immortal praise  Nature who deck'd thy form with Beauty's flowers  Exhausted on thy soul her finer powers  Taught it with all her energy to feel  Love's melting softness Friendship's fervid zeal  The generous purpose and the active thought  With Charity's diffusive spirit fraught  There all the best of mental gifts she plac'd  Vigor of Judgment purity of Taste  Superior parts without their spleenful leaven  Kindness to Earth and confidence in Heaven  While my fond thoughts o'er all thy merits roll  Thy praise thus gushes from my filial soul  Nor will the Public with harsh rigor blame  This my just homage to thy honor'd name  To please that Public if to please be mine  Thy Virtues train'd melet the praise be thine  Since thou hast reach'd that world where Love alone  Where Love Parental can exceed thy own  If in celestial realms the blest may know  And aid the objects of their care below  While in this sublunary scene of strife  Thy Son possesses frail and feverish life  If Heaven allot him many an added hour  Gild it with virtuous thought and mental power  Power to exalt with every aim refin'd  The loveliest of the Arts that bless mankind  END OF THE FOURTH EPISTLE

destin'd more oppressive wrong to feel  From the misguided Friend's perplexing zeal  Such Friends are those who in their proud display  Of thy young beauty and thy early sway  Pretend thou'rt robb'd of all thy warmth sublime  By the benumbing touch of modern Time  What is the Epic Muse that lofty Fair  Who makes the discipline of Earth her care  That mighty Minister whom Virtue leads  To train the noblest minds to noblest deeds  Is she in office great in glory rich  Degraded to a poor pretended Witch  Who rais'd her spells and all her magic power  But on the folly of the favoring hour  Whose dark despis'd illusions melt away  At the clear dawn of Philosophic day  To such they sink her who lament her fall  From the high Synod of th' Olympian Hall  Who worship System hid in Fancy's veil  And think that all her Epic force must fail  If she no more can borrow or create  Celestial Agents to uphold her state  To prove if this fam'd doctrine may be found  To rest on solid or on sandy ground  Let Critic Reason all her light diffuse  O'er the wide empire of this injur'd Muse  To guide our search to every varied source  And seperate sinew of her vital force  To three prime powers within the human frame  With equal energy she points her aim  By pure exalted Sentiment she draws  From Judgment's steady voice no light applause  By Nature's simple and pathetic strains  The willing homage of the Heart she gains  The precious tribute she receives from these  Shines undebas'd by changing Time's decrees  The noble thought that fir'd a Grecian soul  Keeps o'er a British mind its firm controul  The scenes where Nature seems herself to speak  Still touch a Briton as they touch'd a Greek  To captivate admiring Fancy's eyes  She bids celestial decorations rise  But as a playful and capricious child  Frowns at the splendid toy on which it smil'd  So wayward Fancy now with scorn surveys  Those specious Miracles she lov'd to praise  Still fond of change and fickle Fashion's dupe  Now keen to soar and eager now to stoop  Her Gods Dev'ls Saints Magicians rise and fall  And now she worships each now laughs at all  If then within the rich and wide domain  O'er which the Epic Muse delights to reign  One province weaker than the rest be found  'Tis her Celestial Sphere or Fairy Ground  Her realm of Marvels is the distant land  O'er which she holds a perilous command  For plac'd beyond the reach of Nature's aid  Here her worst foes her tottering force invade  O'er the wide precinct proud Opinion towers  And withers with a look its alter'd powers  While lavish Ridicule pert Child of Taste  Turns the rich confine to so poor a waste  That some who deem it but a cumbrous weight  Would lop this Province from its Parent State  What mighty voice first spoke this wond'rous law  Which ductile Critics still repeat with awe  That man's unkindling spirit must refuse  A generous plaudit to th' Heroic Muse  Howe'er she paint her scenes of manly life  If no superior Agents aid the strife  In days of courtly wit and wanton mirth  The loose PETRONIUS gave the maxim birth  Ver See NOTE I  Perchance to sooth the envious Nero's ear  And sink the Bard whose fame he sigh'd to hear  To injure LUCAN whose advent'rous mind  Inflam'd by Freedom with just scorn resign'd  Th' exhausted fables of the starry pole  And found a nobler theme in CATO's soul  To wound him in the mask of Critic art  The subtle Courtier launch'd this venom'd dart  And following Critics fond of Classic lore  Still echo the vain law from shore to shore  On Poets still for Deities they call  And deem mere earthly Bards no Bards at all  Yet if by fits the mighty HOMER nods  Where sinks he more than with his sleepy Gods  E'en LUCAN proves by his immortal name  How weak the dagger levell'd at his fame  For in his Song which Time will ne'er forget  If Taste who much may praise will much regret  'Tis not the absence of th' Olympian state  Embroil'd by jarring Gods in coarse debate  'Tis nice arrangement Nature's easy air  In scenes unfolded with superior care  'Tis softer diction elegantly terse  And the fine polish of Virgilian Verse  O blind to Nature who assert the Muse  Must o'er the human frame her empire lose  Failing to fly in Fancy's wild career  Above this visible diurnal sphere  Behold yon pensive Fair who turns with grief  The tender Novel's soulpossessing leaf  Why with moist eyes to those soft pages glu'd  Forgetting her fix'd hours of sleep and food  Why does she keenly grasp its precious woes  Nor quit the volume till the story close  'Tis not that Fancy plays her revels there  Cheating the mind with lucid forms of air  'Tis not that Passion in a style impure  Holds the warm spirit by a wanton lure  'Tis suffering Virtue's sympathetic sway  That all the fibres of her breast obey  'Tis Action where Immortals claim no part  'Tis Nature grappled to the human heart  If this firm Sov'reign of the feeling breast  Can thus the fascinated thought arrest  And thro' the bosom's deep recesses pierce  Ungrac'd unaided by enchanting Verse  Say shall we think with limited controul  She wants sufficient force to seize the soul  When Harmony's congenial tones convey  Charms to her voice that aid its magic sway  If Admiration's hand with eager grasp  Her darling HOMER's deathless volume clasp  Say to what scenes her partial eyes revert  Say what they first explore and last desert  The scenes that glitter with no heavenly blaze  Where human agents human feelings raise  While Truth enamor'd of the lovely line  Cries to their parent Nature "These are thine"  When Neptune rises in Homeric state  And on their Lord the Powers of Ocean wait  Tho' pliant Fancy trace the steps he trod  And with a transient worship own the God  Yet colder readers with indifference view  The Sovereign of the deep and all his vassal crew  Nor feel his watery pomp their mind enlarge  More than the pageant of my Lord May'r's barge  But when Achilles' wrongs our eyes engage  All bosoms burn with sympathetic rage  And when thy love parental Chief of Troy  Hastes to relieve the terrors of thy boy  Our senses in thy fond emotion join  And every heart's in unison with thine  Still in the Muse's ear shall Echo ring  That heavenly Agents are her vital spring  Those who conclude her winning charms arise  From Beings darting from the distant skies  Appear to cherish a conceit as vain  As once was harbour'd in Neanthus' brain  When he believ'd that harmony must dwell  In the cold concave of the Orphic shell  The ancient Lyre to which the Thracian sung  Whose hallow'd chords were in a temple hung  The shallow Youth with weak ambition sought  And of the pilfering Priest the relique bought  Viewing his treasure with deluded gaze  He deem'd himself the heir of Orphic praise  But when his awkward fingers tried to bring  Expected music from the silent string  Not e'en the milder brutes his discord bore  But howling dogs the fancied Orpheus tore  Ver See NOTE II  When the true Poet in whose frame are join'd  Softness of Heart and Energy of Mind  His Epic scene's expansive limit draws  Faithful to Nature's universal laws  If thro' her various walks he boldly range  Marking how oft her pliant features change  If as she teaches his quick powers supply  Successive pictures to th' astonish'd eye  Where noblest passions noblest deeds inspire  And radiant souls exhibit all their fire  Where softer forms their sweet attractions blend  And suffering Beauty makes the world her friend  If thus he build his Rhyme with varied art  On each dear interest of the human heart  His genius by no vain conceits betray'd  May spurn faint Allegory's feeble aid  Th' Heroic Muse in earthly virtue strong  May drive the host of Angels from her Song  As her fair Sister Muse the Tragic Queen  Has banish'd Ghosts from her pathetic scene  Tho' her high soul by SHAKESPEARE's magic sway'd  Still bends to buried Denmark's aweful Shade  If we esteem this Epic Queen so great  To spare her heavenly train yet keep her state  'Tis not our aim with systematic pride  To sink their glory or their powers to hide  Who add when folded in the Muse's arms  Celestial beauty to her earthly charms  Sublimely fashion'd by no mortal hands  The dome of mental Pleasure wide expands  Form'd to preside o'er its allotted parts  At different portals stand the separate Arts  But every portal different paths may gain  Alike uniting in the mystic Fane  Contentious mortals on these paths debate  Some wrangling on the road ne'er reach the gate  While others arm'd with a despotic rod  Allow no pass but what themselves have trod  The noblest spirits to this foible prone  Have slander'd powers congenial with their own  Hence on a Brother's genius MILTON frown'd  Scorning the graceful chains of final sound  And to one form confin'd the free sublime  Insulting DRYDEN as the Man of Rhyme  Caprice still gives this lasting struggle life  Rhyme and Blank Verse maintain their idle strife  The friends of one are still the other's foes  For stubborn Prejudice no mercy knows  As in Religion Zealots blindly warm  Neglect the Essence while they grasp the Form  Poetic Bigots thus perversely wrong  Think Modes of Verse comprize the Soul of Song  If the fine statuary fill his part  With all the powers of energetic Art  If to the figures that with skill exact  His genius blends in one impassion'd act  If to this Group such speaking force he give  That startled Nature almost cries "They live"  All tongues with zeal th' enchanting work applaud  Nor the great Artist of due praise defraud  Whether he form'd the rich expressive mass  Of Parian marble or Corinthian brass  For each his powers might fashion to fulfil  The noblest purpose of mimetic skill  Each from his soul might catch Promethean fire  And speak his talents till the world expire  'Tis thus that MILTON's Verse and DRYDEN's Rhyme  Are proof alike against the rage of Time  Each Master modell'd with a touch so bold  The rude materials which he chose to mould  That each his portion to perfection brought  Accomplishing the glorious end he sought  False to themselves and to their interest blind  Are those cold judges of fastidious mind  Who with vain rules the suffering Arts would load  Who ere they smile consult the Critic's code  Where puzzled by the different doubts they see  For who so oft as Critics disagree  They lose that pleasure by free spirits seiz'd  In vainly settling how they should be pleas'd  Far wiser those who with a generous joy  Nor blindly fond nor petulantly coy  Follow each movement of the varying Muse  Whatever step her airy form may chuse  Nor to one march her rapid feet confine  While ease and spirit in her gesture join  Those who facilitate her free desire  To melt the heart or set the soul on fire  Who if her voice to simple Nature lean  And fill with Human forms her Epic scene  Pleas'd with her aim assist her moral plan  And feel with manly sympathy for Man  Or if she draw by Fancy's magic tones  Aetherial Spirits from their sapphire thrones  Her Heavenly shapes with willing homage greet  And aid with ductile thought her bright deceit  For if the Epic Muse still wish to tower  Above plain Nature's firm and graceful power  Tho' Critics think her vital powers are lost  In cold Philosophy's petrific frost  That Magic cannot her sunk charms restore  That Heaven and Hell can yield her nothing more  Yet may she dive to many a secret source  And copious spring of visionary force  India yet holds a Mythologic mine  Her strength may open and her art refine  Tho' Asian spoils the realms of Europe fill  Those Eastern riches are unrifled still  Genius may there his course of honor run  And spotless Laurels in that field be won  Ver See NOTE III  Yet

FIRST EPISTLE  NOTE I Ver  SUCH dark decrees have letter'd Bigots penn'd  Yet seiz'd that honor'd name the Poet's Friend  Of the several authors who have written on Epic Poetry many of the most celebrated are more likely to confound and depress than to enlighten and exalt the young Poetical Student The Poetics of Scaliger which are little more than a laboured panegyric of Virgil would lead him to regard the Aeneid as the only standard of perfection and the more elegant and accomplished Vida inculcates the same pusillanimous lesson though in spirited and harmonious verse  Unus hic ingenio praestanti gentis Achivae  Divinos vates longe superavit et arte  Aureus immortale sonans stupet ipsa pavetque  Quamvis ingentem miretur Graecia Homerum  Ergo ipsum ante alios animo venerare Maronem  Atque unum sequere utque potes vestigia serva  VIDA  See how the Grecian Bards at distance thrown  With reverence bow to this distinguish'd son  Immortal sounds his golden lines impart  And nought can match his Genius but his Art  E'en Greece turns pale and trembles at his fame  Which shades the lustre of her Homer's name  Hence sacred Virgil from thy soul adore  Above the rest and to thy utmost power  Pursue the glorious paths he struck before  PITT's Translation  A Critic who lately rose to great eminence in our own country has endeavoured by a more singular method to damp the ardour of inventive Genius and to annihilate the hopes of all who would aspire to the praise of originality in this higher species of poetical composition He has attempted to establish a Triumvirate in the Epic world with a perpetuity of dominion Every reader who is conversant with modern criticism will perceive that I allude to the following passage in the famous Dissertation on the sixth Book of Virgil"Just as Virgil rivalled Homer so Milton emulated both of them He found Homer possessed of the province of Morality Virgil of Politics and nothing left for him but that of Religion This he seized as aspiring to share with them in the government of the Poetic world and by means of the superior dignity of his subject hath gotten to the head of that Triumvirate which took so many ages in forming these are the three species of the Epic Poem for its largest sphere is  human action  which can be considered but in a  moral  political or religious view and these the three  Makers  for each of their Poems was struck out at a heat and came to perfection from its first essay Here then the grand scene was closed and all farther improvements of the Epic at an end"  I apprehend that few critical remarks contain more  absurdity  to use the favourite expression of the author I have quoted than the preceding lines Surely Milton is himself a proof that  human action  is not the largest sphere of the Epic Poem and as to Virgil his most passionate admirers must allow that in subject and design he is much less of an original than Camoens or Lucan But such a critical statute of limitation if I may call it so is not less pernicious than absurd To disfigure the sphere of Imagination with these capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to science Such Criticism instead of giving spirit  and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful Poet can only lead him to start like Macbeth at unreal mockery and to exclaim when he is invited by Genius to the banquet "The Table's full"  NOTE II Ver  Thus at their banquets fabling Greeks rehearse  The fancied origin of sacred Verse  For this fable such as it is I am indebted to a passage in Athenaeus which the curious reader may find in the close of that fanciful and entertaining compiler page of Casaubon's edition  NOTE III Ver  Why did the Epic Muse's silent lyre  Shrink from those feats that summon'd all her fire  I have ventured to suppose that Greece produced no worthy successor of Homer and that her exploits against the Persians were not celebrated by any Poet in a manner suitable to so sublime a subjectyet an author named Chaerilus is said to have recorded those triumphs of his country in verse and to have pleased the Athenians so highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward He is supposed to have been a cotemporary of the historian Herodotus But from the general silence of the more early Greek writers concerning the merit of this Poet we may I think very fairly conjecture that his compositions were not many degrees superior to those of his unfortunate namesake who frequented the court of Alexander the Great and is said to have sung the exploits of his Sovereign on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good verse and a box on the ear for every bad one The old Scholiast on Horace who has preserved this idle story concludes it by saying that the miserable Bard was beat to death in consequence of his contract Some eminent modern Critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early Chaerilus who is supposed to be confounded both by Horace himself and afterwards by Scaliger with the Chaerilus rewarded by Alexander Vossius  De Historicis Graecis  in particular appears a warm advocate in his behalf and appeals to various fragments of the ancient Bard  preserved by Aristotle Strabo and others and to the testimony of Plutarch in his favour But on consulting the fragments he has referred to they rather fortify than remove my conjecture The scrap preserved by Aristotle in his Rhetoric is only half a verse and quoted without any commendation of its author The two citations in Strabo amount to little more The curious reader may also find in Athenaeus an Epitaph on Sardanapalus attributed to this Poet who is mentioned by the same author as peculiarly addicted to the grosser excesses of the tableLet us now return to that Chaerilus whom Horace has "damn'd to everlasting fame" The judicious and elegant Roman Satirist seems remarkably unjust in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron Augustus at the expence of the Macedonian hero Alexander appears to have possessed much more poetical spirit and a higher relish for poetry than the coldblooded Octavius It is peculiarly unfair to urge his liberality to a poor Poet as a proof that he wanted critical discernment when he had himself so thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his taste by the enthusiastic Bonmot that he had rather be the Thersites of Homer than the Achilles of Chaerilus  NOTE IV VERSE  When grave Bossu by System's studied laws  The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws  Though Bossu is called "the best explainer of Aristotle and one of the most learned and judicious of modern critics" by a writer for whose opinions I have much esteem I cannot help thinking that his celebrated Essay on Epic Poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to inspirit a young Poet The absurdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable by chusing a moral inventing the incidents and then searching history for names to suit them has been sufficiently exposed and as to his leading idea concerning the design of Homer in the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey I apprehend most poetical readers must feel that he is probably mistaken for it is a conjectural point and placed beyond the possibility of decision Perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking by the force of education and of national manners than a modern French Critic and an early Poet of Greece yet the former will often pretend with the most decisive air  to lay open the sensorium of an ancient Bard and to count every link in the chain of his ideas Those who are most acquainted with the movements of imagination will acknowledge the steps of this airy power to be so light and evanescent in their nature that perhaps a Poet himself in a few years after finishing his work might be utterly unable to recollect the exact train of thought or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general design or directed him in the particular parts of his poem But in spite of the interval of many hundred centuries the decisive magic of criticism can call up all the shadows of departed thought that ever existed in his brain and display with a most astonishing clearness the precise state of his mind in the moment of composition  "Homere" says Bossu "  Livre i chap  voyoit les Grecs pour qui il écrivoit diviséz en autant d'etats qu'ils avoient de villes considerables chacune faisoit un corps à part avoit sa forme de gouvernement independamment de toutes les autres Et toutefois ces etats differens etoient souvent obligéz de se reünir comme en un seul corps contre leurs ennemis communs Voila sans doute deux sortes de gouvernemens bien differens pour etre commodement reunis en un corps de morale en un seul poëme  "Le poëte en a donc fait deux fables separées L'une est pour toute la Grece reünie en un seul corps mais composée de parties independantes les unes des autres comme elles etoient en effect l'autre est pour chaque etat particulier tels qu'ils etoient pendant la paix sans ce premier rapport sans la necesseté de se reünir  "Homere a donc pris pour le fond de sa fable cette grande verité que la Mesintelligence des princes ruine leurs propres etats"  On the Odyssey Bossu remarks "Que la verité qui sert de fond à cette fiction qui avec elle compose la fable est que l'absence d'une personne hors de chez soi ou qui n'a point l'oeil à ce qui s'y fait y cause de grands desordres  Livre i chap  "  On the mature consideration of these two moral axioms the Critic supposes the sublime Bard to have begun his respective Poems for Homer continues he "  Livre i chap  n'avoit point d'autre dessein que de former  agreablement les moeurs de ses Citoïens en leur proposant comme dit Horace ce qui est utile ou pernicieux ce qui est honnete ou ce qui ne l'est pas il n'a entrepris de raconter aucune action particuliere d'Achille ou d'Ulysse Il a fait la fable et le dessein de ses poemes sans penser à ces princes ensuite il leur a fait l'honneur de donner leurs noms aux heros qu'il avoit feints"  The preceding remarks of this celebrated Critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture which most happily illustrates the real purpose of Homer To me they appear so much the reverse that if I ventured to adopt any decided opinion on a point so much darkened by the clouds of antiquity I should rather incline to the idea which Bossu affects to explode and suppose the Poems of Homer intended panegyrics on the very princes whom the Critic affirms he never thought of while he was designing the works which have made them immortal  There is a striking passage on this subject in a dialogue of Plato which I shall enlarge upon for two reasons st As it proves that the latter persuasion concerning the purpose of Homer was entertained at Athens and dly Because it gives me a pleasing opportunity of supporting the learned Madame Dacier against an illgrounded censure of a late English critic In her Preface to the Odyssey she asserts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favor of the Iliad and she appeals to part of the sentence in Plato to which I have alluded as a proof of her assertion Mr Wood in a note to the Introduction of his Essay on Homer endeavours to shew the insufficiency of this proof and still farther to convince us that Madame Dacier was utterly mistaken in her sense of the passage to which she appealed If he ventures to contradict this learned lady he does not however insult her with that insolent pertness with which she is frequently treated in the notes to Pope's Homer and which for the honour of our English Poet I will not suppose to be his But though Mr Wood endeavours to support his opinion by argument I apprehend that he is himself mistaken and that Madame Dacier is perfectly right in understanding the words of Socrates in their literal sense without the least mixture of irony It is true indeed that the aim of Socrates in the course of the dialogue is to ridicule the presumption and ignorance of the sophist Hippias in the  most ironical manner but the particular speech on Which Madame Dacier founds her opinion is a plain and simple address to Eudicus before he enters on his debate with the Sophist It turns on the most simple circumstance the truth of which Eudicus could hardly be ignorant of namely the sentiments of his own father concerning the Poems of Homer As these sentiments are such as I believe most admirers of the ancient Bard have entertained on the point in question I perfectly agree with Madame Dacier in thinking that Socrates means to be literal and serious when he says to Eudicus  Plat Hip min edit Serrani tom i pag " I have heard your father Apemantus say that the Iliad of Homer was a finer poem than his Odyssey and as far surpassed it in excellence as the virtue of Achilles surpassed the virtue of Ulysses for those two poems he said were purposely composed in honour of those two heroes the Odyssey to shew the virtues of Ulysses the Iliad those of Achilles" Plato's Lesser Hippias translated by Sydenham page  Let us now return to Bossu whose opinion concerning the purpose of Homer we may venture to oppose supported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of some ambiguous passages in the Poetics of Aristotle and this opposition may be grounded not so much on the sentence which I have quoted from Plato as on the probable conduct of Epic composition in the early ages of poetry In such periods as produced the talents of Virgil and of Dryden when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly understood we can easily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the mask of such heroic names as history could supply and their genius accommodate to their purpose We find accordingly that the Roman Bard is supposed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his Emperor in the character of Aeneas and that the English Poet has with equal ingenuity enwrapt the dissolute Charles the Second in the Jewish robes of King David But in so rude an age as we must admit that of Homer to have been when the Poet was certainly more the child of Nature than of Art when he had no history to consult perhaps no patron to flatter and no critics  to elude or obey in such an age may we not more naturally conjecture that poetical composition was neither laboured in its form nor deep in its design that instead of being the slow and systematic product of political reasoning it was the quick and artless offspring of a strong and vivifying fancy which brooding over the tales of tradition soon raised them into such life and beauty as must satisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience ever ready to listen with delight to the heroic feats of their ancestors  If the learned Bossu appears unfortunate in his system concerning the purpose of Homer he may be thought still more so in his attempt to analyze the Divinities of Virgil for to throw new light on the convention of the Gods in the opening of the tenth Aeneid he very seriously informs us that "  Book v chap I  Venus is divine mercy or the love of God towards virtuous men and Juno his justice"  I cannot conclude these very free strictures on a celebrated author without bearing a pleasing testimony to the virtues of the manBossu is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the mildest manners and most amiable disposition totally free from that imperious and bigotted attachment to speculative opinions which the science he cultivated is so apt to produce He endeared himself to Boileau by a generous act of friendship that led to an intimacy between them which was dissolved only by the death of the former in  NOTE V VERSE  Imputes to Virgil his own dark conceit  As it requires much leisure to examine and more skill to unravel an intricate hypothesis twisted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argument the Dissertation on the sixth Book of Virgil remained for some time unrefuted The public very quietly acquiesced in the strange position of its author "That Aeneas's adventure to the infernal shades is no other than a figurative description of his initiation into the Mysteries and particularly a very exact one of the spectacles of the Eleusinian" At length a superior but anonymous Critic arose who in one of the most judicious  and spirited essays that our nation has produced on a point of classical literature completely overturned this illfounded edifice and exposed the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect The Essay I allude to is entitled "Critical Observations on the Sixth Book of the Aeneid" printed for Elmsly and as this little publication is I believe no longer to be purchased the curious reader may thank me for transcribing a few of its most striking passages  Having ridiculed with great spirit and propriety Warburton's general idea of the Aeneid as a political institute and his illsupported assertion that both the ancient and modern poets afforded Virgil a pattern for introducing the Mysteries into this famous episode the author proceeds to examine how far the Critic's hypothesis of initiation may be supported or overthrown by the text of the Poet "It is" says he "from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of Virgil's allegory Every one of these circumstances persuades me that Virgil described a real not a mimic world and that the scene lay in the Infernal Shades and not in the Temple of Ceres  "The singularity of the Cumaean shores must be present to every traveller who has once seen them To a superstitious mind the thin crust vast cavities sulphureous steams poisonous exhalations and fiery torrents may seem to trace out the narrow confine of the two worlds The lake Avernus was the chief object of religious horror the black woods which surrounded it when Virgil first came to Naples were perfectly suited to feed the superstition of the people  Strabo I v p  It was generally believed that this deadly flood was the entrance of Hell  Sil Ital l xii  and an oracle was once established on its banks which pretended by magic rites to call up the departed spirits  Diod Siculus l iv p edit Wesseling  Aeneas who revolved a more daring enterprize addresses himself to the priestess of those dark regions Their conversation may perhaps inform us whether an initiation or a descent to the Shades was the object of this enterprize She endeavours to deter the hero by setting before him all the dangers of his rash undertaking  Facilis descensus Averni  Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis  Sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras  Hoc opus hic labor est  Aeneid vi    These particulars are absolutely irreconcileable with the idea of initiation but perfectly agreeable to that of a real descent That every step and every instant may lead us to the grave is a melancholy truth The Mysteries were only open at stated times a few days at most in the course of a year The mimic descent of the Mysteries was laborious and dangerous the return to light easy and certain In real death this order is inverted  Pauci quos aequus amavit  Jupiter aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus  Diis geniti potuere  Ibid vi    These heroes as we learn from the Speech of Aeneas were Hercules Orpheus Castor and Pollux Theseus and Pirithous Of all these antiquity believed that before their death they had seen the habitations of the dead nor indeed will any of the circumstances tally with a supposed initiation The adventure of Eurydice the alternate life of the Brothers and the forcible intrusion of Alcides Theseus and Pirithous would mock the endeavours of the most subtle critic who should try to melt them down into his favourite Mysteries The exploits of Hercules who triumphed over the King of Terrors  Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit  Ipsius a solio regis traxitque trementem  Ibid vi    was a wild imagination of the Greeks  Homer Odyss l xi ver Apoll Bib l ii c  but it was the duty of ancient Poets to adopt and embellish these popular traditions and it is the interest of every man of taste to acquiesce in  their poetical fictions  Virgil has borrowed as usual from Homer his episode of the  Infernal Shades and as usual has infinitely improved what the Grecian had invented If among a profusion of beauties I durst venture to point out the most striking beauties of the sixth Book I should perhaps observe That after accompanying the hero through the silent realms of Night and Chaos we see with astonishment and pleasure a new creation bursting upon us That we examine with a delight which springs from the love of virtue the just empire of Minos in which the apparent irregularities of the present system are corrected where the patriot who died for his country is happy and the tyrant who oppressed it is miserable As we interest ourselves in the hero's fortunes we share his feelingsthe melancholy Palinurus the wretched Deiphobus the indignant Dido the Graecian kings who tremble at his presence and the venerable Anchises who embraces his pious son and displays to his sight the future glories of his race all these objects affect us with a variety of pleasing sensations  Let us for a moment obey the mandate of our great Critic and consider these aweful scenes as a mimic shew exhibited in the Temple of Ceres by the contrivance of the priest or if he pleases of the legislator Whatever was animated I appeal to every reader of taste whatever was terrible or whatever was pathetic evaporates into lifeless allegory  Tenuem sine viribus umbram  Dat inania verba  Dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis  The end of philosophy is truth the end of poetry is pleasure I willingly adopt any interpretation which adds new beauties to the original I assist in persuading myself that it is just and could almost shew the same indulgence to the Critic's as to the Poet's fiction But should a grave Doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of Virgil I should have every inducement to believe that Virgil's soul was very different from the Doctor's  Having shewn in this spirited manner how far the hypothesis of the Critic is inconsistent with particular passages and with the general character of the Poet the Essayist proceeds to alledge "two simple  reasons which persuade him that Virgil has not revealed the secret of the Eleusinian mysteries the first is  his ignorance  and the second  his discretion  " The author then proves by very ingenious historical arguments st That it is probable the Poet was never initiated himself and dly That if he were so it is more probable that he would not have violated the laws both of religion and of honour in betraying the secret of the Mysteries particularly as that species of profanation is mentioned with abhorrence by a cotemporary Poet  Vetabo qui Cereris sacrum  Vulgârit arcanae sub iisdem  Sit trabibus fragilemque mecum  Solvat phaselum  HOR liii od  When Horace composed the Ode which contains the preceding passage "the Aeneid continues my author and particularly the sixth Book were already known to the public  Donat in Virgil Propert lii el xxv v  The detestation of the wretch who reveals the Mysteries of Ceres though expressed in general terms must be applied by all Rome to the author of the sixth Book of the Aeneid Can we seriously suppose that Horace would have branded with such wanton infamy one of the men in the world whom he loved and honoured the most  Hor li od li serm v ver c    "Nothing remains to say except that Horace was himself ignorant of his friend's allegorical meaning which the Bishop of Gloucester has since revealed to the world It may be so yet for my own part I should be very well satisfied with understanding Virgil no better than Horace did"  Such is the forcible reasoning of this ingenious and spirited writer I have been tempted to transcribe these considerable portions of his Work by an idea perhaps an illfounded one that the circulation of his little Pamphlet has not been equal to its merit But if it has been in any degree neglected by our country it has not escaped  the researches or wanted the applause of a learned and judicious foreigner Professor Heyne the late accurate and accomplished Editor of Virgil has mentioned it in his Comments to the sixth Book of the Aeneid with the honour it deserves He remarks indeed that the Author has censured the learned Prelate with some little acrimony "Paullo acrius quam velis" But what lover of poetry unbiassed by personal connection can speak of Warburton without some marks of indignation If I have also alluded to this famous Commentator with a contemptuous asperity it arises from the persuasion that he has sullied the page of every Poet whom he pretended to illustrate and that he frequently degraded the useful and generous profession of Criticism into a mean instrument of personal malignity or to use the more forcible language of his greatest antagonist that he "invested himself in the high office of Inquisitor General and Supreme Judge of the Opinions of the Learned which he assumed and exercised with a ferocity and despotism without example in the Republic of Letters and hardly to be paralleled among the disciples of Dominic  Letter to Warburton by a late Professor c page d edition  " It is the just lot of tyrants to be detested and of all usurpers the literary despot is the least excusable as he has not the common tyrannical plea of necessity or interest to alledge in his behalf for the prevalence of  his edicts  will be found to sink in proportion to the arbitrary tone with which they are pronounced The fate of Warburton is a striking instance of this important truth What havock has the course of very few years produced in that pile of imperious criticism which he had heaped together Many of his notes on Shakespeare have already resigned their place to the superior comments of more accomplished Critics and perhaps the day is not far distant when the volumes of Pope himself will cease to be a repository for the lumber of his friend The severest enemies of Warburton must indeed allow that several of his remarks on his Poetical Patron are entitled to preservation by their use or beauty but the greater part I apprehend are equally destitute of both and how far the Critic was capable of disgracing the Poet must be evident to every reader who recollects that the nonsense in the Essay on Criticism where  Pegasus is made to  snatch a grace  which is justly censured by Dr Warton was first introduced into the poem by an arbitrary transposition of the editor  Though arrogance is perhaps the most striking and characteristical defect in the composition of this assuming Commentator he had certainly other critical failings of considerable importance and it may possibly be rendering some little service to the art which he professed to investigate the peculiarities in this singular writer which conspire to plunge him in the crowd of those  evanescent critics  if I may use such an expression whom his friend Pope beheld in so clear a vision that he seems to have given us a prophetical portrait of his own Commentator  Critics I saw that others' names efface  And fix their own with labour in the place  Their own like others' soon their place resign'd  Or disappear'd and left the first behind  I shall therefore hazard a few farther observations not only on this famous Critic of our age and country but on the two greater names of antiquity to each of whom he has been declared superior by the partial voice of enthusiastic friendship I wish not to offend his most zealous adherents and though I cannot but consider him as a literary usurper I speak of him as a great Historian said of more exalted tyrants sine ira et studio quorum causas procul habeoThere seem to be three natural endowments requisite in the formation of an accomplished criticstrong understanding lively imagination and refined sensibility The first was the characteristic of Aristotle and by the consent of all ages he is allowed to have possessed it in a superlative degree May I be pardoned for the opinion that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the  other two  I would not absolutely say that he had neither Fancy nor Feeling but that his imagination was  not brilliant  and that his sensibility was not exquisite may I think be fairly presumed from the general tenor of his prose nor does the little relique of his poetry contradict the idea The two qualities in which Aristotle may be supposed defective were the very two which peculiarly distinguish Longinus who certainly wanted not understanding though he might not possess the philosophical  sagacity of the Stagyrite When considered in every point of view he appears the most consummate character among the Critics of antiquity If Warburton wore any resemblance to either of these mighty names I apprehend it must be to the former and perhaps in imagination he was superior to Aristotle but of the three qualities which I have ventured to consider as requisite in the perfect Critic I conceive him to have been miserably deficient in the last and certainly the most essential of the three for as the great Commentator of Horace has philosophically and truly remarked in a note to that Poet "Feeling or Sentiment is not only the surest but the sole ultimate arbiter of works of genius  Notes on the Epistle to Augustus ver  " A man may possess an acute understanding and a lively imagination without being a sound Critic and this truth perhaps cannot be more clearly shewn than in the writings of Warburton His understanding was undoubtedly acute his imagination was lively but Imagination and Sentiment are by no means synonymous and he certainly wanted those finer feelings which constitute accuracy of discernment and a perfect perception of literary excellence In consequence of this defect instead of seizing the real sense and intended beauties of an author he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy which led him in quest of secret meanings and mysterious allusions these he readily found and his powers of understanding enabled him to dress them up in a plausible and specious form and to persuade many readers that he was what he believed himself to be the restorer of genuine Criticism As a farther proof that he was destitute of refined sensibility I might alledge the peculiarity of his diction which as Dr Johnson has very justly remarked is coarse and impure Perhaps it may be found that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which I suppose him to have wanted they have been more or less distinguished by the ease the elegance and the beauty of their language were I required to fortify this conjecture by examples I should produce the names of Virgil and Racine of Fenelon and Addisonthat Addison who though insulted by the Commentator of Pope with the names of an indifferent Poet and a worse Critic was I think as much superior to his insulter in critical taste and in solidity of judgment as he confessedly  was in the harmony of his style and in all the finer graces of beautiful composition  NOTE VI VERSE  'Tis said by one who with this candid claim  Has gain'd no fading wreath of critic fame  These and the six subsequent lines allude to the following passage in Dr Warton's Essay on Pope "I conclude these reflections with a remarkable fact In no polished nation after Criticism has been much studied and the rules of writing established has any very extraordinary work ever appeared This has visibly been the case in Greece in Rome and in France after Aristotle Horace and Boileau had written their Arts of Poetry In our own country the rules of the Drama for instance were never more completely understood than at present yet what uninteresting though faultless Tragedies have we lately seen so much better is our judgment than our execution How to account for the fact here mentioned adequately and justly would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art or whether that philosophical that geometrical and systematical spirit so much in vogue which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature by consulting only  reason  has not diminished and destroyed  sentiment  and made our poets write from and to the  head  rather than the heart or whether lastly when just models from which the rules have necessarily been drawn have once appeared succeeding writers by vainly and ambitiously striving to surpass those just models and to shine and surprise do not become stiff and forced and affected in their thoughts and diction" Warton's Essay page d editionI admire this ingenious and modest reasoning but for the honour of that severer art which this pleasing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embellish I will venture to start some doubts concerning the fact itself for which he endeavours to account Perhaps our acquaintance with those writings of Greece and Rome which were subsequent to Aristotle and Horace is not sufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in respect  to those countries But with regard to France may we not assert that her poetical productions which arose after the publication of Boileau's Didactic Essay are at least equal if not superior to those which preceded that period If the Henriade of Voltaire is not a fine Epic poem it is allowed to be the best which the French have to boast not to mention the dramatic works of that extraordinary and universal author If this remarkable fact may indeed be found true I should rather suppose it to arise from the irritable nature of the poetic spirit so peculiarly averse to restraint and controul The Bard who could gallop his Pegasus over a free and open plain might be eager to engage in so pleasing an exercise but he who observed the directionposts so thickly and so perversely planted that instead of assisting his career they must probably occasion his fall would easily be tempted to descend from his steed and to decline the course Let me illustrate this conjecture by a striking fact in the very words of the Poet just mentioned who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence and who has left us the following anecdote of himself in that pleasing little anonymous work entitled Commentaire Historique sur les Oeuvres de l' Auteur de la Henriade "Il lut un jour plusieurs chants de ce poeme chez le jeune Président de Maisons son intime ami On l'impatienta par des objections il jetta son manuscrit dans le feu Le Président Hénaut l'en retira avec peine "Souvenez vous lui dit Mr Hénaut dans une de ses lettres que c'est moi qui ai sauvé la Henriade et qu'il m'en a couté une belle paire de manchettes"  To return to the Essay on PopeI rejoice that the amiable Critic has at length obliged the public with the conclusion of his most engaging and ingenious work he has the singular talent to instruct and to please even those readers who are most ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavours to establish and he has in some degree atoned for that excess of severity which his first volume discovered and which sunk the reputation of Pope in the eyes of many who judge not for themselves even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it Had Pope been alive to add this spirited essay to the bundle of writings against himself which he is said to have collected he must have felt that like the dagger of Brutus it gave the most painful blow from the character of the assailant  All the conspirators save only he  Did that they did in envy of great Caesar  He only in a general honest thought  And common good to all made one of them  Yet Pope ascended not the throne of Poetry by usurpation but was seated there by a legal title of which I shall speak farther in a subsequent note  NOTE VII VERSE  His hallow'd subject by that Law forbid  Might still have laid in silent darkness hid  Boileau's Art of Poetry made its first appearance in six years after the publication of Paradise Lost The verses of the French Poet to which I have particularly alluded are these  C'est

said to have been levelled at the Clovis of Desmaretz appear so pointed against the subject of Milton that we might almost believe them intended as a satire on our divine Bard  There is nothing in Boileau's admirable Didactic Essay so liable to objection as the whole passage concerning Epic poetry His patronage of the old Pagan divinities and his oblique recommendation of Classical heroes are alike exceptionable Even a higher name than Boileau has failed in framing precepts for the Epic Muse The maxims delivered by Tasso himself in his Discourse on Epic poetry are so far from perfect that an agreeable and judicious French critic has very justly said of him "S'il eût mis sa theorie en pratique son poeme n'auroit pas tant de charmes  Marmontel Poetique Françoise  " I am not so vain as to think of succeeding in the point where these immortal authors have failed and I must beg my reader to remember that the present work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the Epic poet it is not my design  To write receipts how poems may be made  For I think the writer who would condescend to frame this higher species of composition according to the exact letter of any directions whatever may be most properly referred to that admirable receipt for an Epic poem with which Martinus Scriblerus will happily supply him My serious desire is to examine and refute the prejudices which have produced as I apprehend the neglect of the Heroic Muse I wish to kindle in our Poets a warmer sense of national honour with ambition to excel in the noblest province of poesy If my essay should excite that generous enthusiasm in the breast of any young poetic genius so far from wishing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination I should rather say to him in the words of Dante's Virgil  Non aspettar mio dir più nè mio cenno  Libero dritto sano è tuo arbitrio  E fallo fora non fare a suo senno  NOTE VIII VERSE  Who scorn'd all limits to his work assign'd  Save by th' inspiring

fame traduc'd by Gallic wit  Homer like most transcendent characters has found detractors in every age We learn from a passage in the life of Socrates by Diogenes Laertius that the great Poet had in his lifetime an adversary named Sagaris or Syagrus and his calumniator Zoilus is proverbially distinguished In the Greek Anthologia there is a sepulchral inscription on a slanderer of the sovereign

Erycius the author of the inscription is supposed to have lived in the same age Among the modern adversaries of Homer the French are most remarkable for their severity and injustice nor is it surprising that the nation which has displayed the faintest sparks of Epic fire should be the most solicitous to reduce the oppressive splendor of this exalted luminary The most depreciating remarks on genius in every walk are generally made by those who are the least able to prove its rivals and often perhaps not so much from the prevalence of envious malignity as from the want of vivid and delicate perception The merits and the failings of Homer were agitated in France with all the heat and acrimony of a theological dispute Madame Dacier distinguished herself in the contest by her uncommon talents and erudition she combated for the Grecian Bard with the spirit of Minerva defending the Father of the Gods It must however be confest that she sometimes overstepped the modesty of wisdom and caught unwarily the scolding tone of Juno It is indeed amusing to observe a people who pique themselves on their extreme politeness and censure Homer for the gross behaviour of his Gods engaging among themselves in a squabble concerning this very Poet with all the unrefined animosity of his Olympian Synod In the whole controversy there is nothing more worthy of remembrance and of praise than the lively elegance and the pleasing goodhumour of Mr de la Motte who though not one of the most exalted was certainly one of the most amiable characters in the literary world and made a generous return to the severity of his female antagonist by writing an ode in her praise  Voltaire has pointed out with his usual spirit the failings of La Motte in his Abridgement of the Iliad but he has frequently fallen himself into similar defects and is equally unjust to Homer against whom he has levelled the most bitter sarcasms both in prose and verse Voltaire attacking Homer is like Paris shooting his arrow at the heel of Achilles the two Poets are as unequal as the two ancient Warriors yet Homer like Achilles may have his vulnerable spot but with this happy difference that although the shaft of ridicule which is pointed against him may be tinged with venom its wound cannot be mortal Perhaps no better answer can be made to all those who amuse themselves with writing against Homer than the following reply of Madame Dacier to the Abbé Terrasson who had attacked her favourite Bard in two abusive volumes"Que Monsieur l'Abbé Terrasson trouve Homere sot ridicule extravagant ennuyeux

both    DION CHRYS p  NOTE III VERSE  How high soe'er she leads his daring flight  c    I mean not to injure the dignity of Pindar by this assertion Though Quinctilian in drawing the character of the Grecian Lyric Poets has given him high preeminence in that choir we may I think very fairly conjecture that some odes of Alcaeus and Stesichorus were not inferior to those of the Theban Bard who is said to have been repeatedly vanquished in a poetical contest by his female antagonist Corinna The absurd jealousy of our sex concerning literary talents has led some eminent writers to question the merits of Corinna as Olearius has observed in his Dissertation on the female Poets of Greece But her glory seems to have been fully established  by the public memorial of her picture exhibited in her native city and adorned with a symbol of her victory Pausanias who saw it supposes her to have been one of the handsomest women of her time and the ingenuity of some Critics imputes her success in the poetical contest to the influence of her beauty They have taken some liberties less pardonable with her literary reputation and by their curious comments on a single Greek syllable made the sublime Pindar call his fair rival  a Sow  though the unfortunate word  which may be twisted into that meaning signifies in its more obvious construction that the Poet challenged his successful antagonist to a new trial of skillFor a more minute account of this singular piece of criticism I must refer the reader to the notes on Corinna in the Fragmenta Poetriarum by Wolfius Time has left us only a few diminutive scraps of Corinna's Poetry but Plutarch in his Treatise on the Glory of the Athenians has preserved one of her critical Bonmots which may deserve to be repeated That author asserts that Corinna instructed Pindar in his youth and advised him to adorn his composition with the embellishments of fable The obedient Poet soon brought her some verses in which he had followed her advice rather too freely when his Tutress smiling at his profusion    NOTE IV VERSE  Yet may not Judgment with severe disdain  Slight the young Rhodian's variegated strain  Apollonius surnamed the Rhodian from the place of his residence is supposed to have been a native of Alexandria where he is said to have recited some portion of his Poem while he was yet a youth Finding it ill received by his countrymen he retired to Rhodes where he is conjectured to have polished and completed his Work supporting himself by the profession of Rhetoric and receiving from the Rhodians the freedom of their city He at length returned with considerable honour to the place of his birth succeeding Eratosthenes in the care of the Alexandrian Library in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes who ascended the throne of Egypt in the year before Christ That prince had been  educated by the famous Aristarchus and rivalled the preceding sovereigns of his liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning Apollonius was a disciple of the poet Callimachus but their connection ended in the most violent enmity which was probably owing to some degree of contempt expressed by Apollonius for the light compositions of his master The learned have vainly endeavoured to discover the particulars of their quarrel The only Work of Apollonius which has descended to modern times is his Poem in four Books on the Argonautic expedition Both Longinus and Quintilian have assigned to this Work the mortifying character of Mediocrity but there lies an appeal from the sentence of the most candid and enlightened Critics to the voice of Nature and the merit of Apollonius has little to apprehend from the decision of this ultimate judge His Poem abounds in animated description and in passages of the most tender and pathetic beauty How finely painted is the first setting forth of the Argo and how beautifully is the wife of Chiron introduced holding up the little Achilles in her arms and shewing him to his father Peleus as he sailed along the shore But the chief excellence in our Poet is the spirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the passion of love in his Medea That Virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is sufficiently evident from the minute exactness with which he has copied many tender touches of the Grecian Poet Those who compare the third Book of Apollonius with the fourth of Virgil may I think perceive not only that Dido has some features of Medea but that the two Bards however different in their reputation resembled each other in their genius and that they both excel in delicacy and pathos  NOTE V VERSE  Virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise  Scaliger appears to be the most extravagant of all the Critics who have lavished their undistinguishing encomiums on Virgil by asserting that he alone is entitled to the name of Poet Poetices lib iii c Though the opinion of Spence and other modern Critics concerning the character of Aeneas considered as an allegorical portrait of Augustus seems to gain ground yet it might perhaps be easy to overturn the ingenious conjectures  and the fanciful reasoning by which that idea has been supported This attempt would have the sanction of one of the most judicious Commentators of Virgil for the learned Heyne expressly rejects all allegorical interpretation and thinks it improbable that a Poet of so correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which must necessarily contract and cramp his powers He even ventures to assert that if the character of Aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of Augustus the execution of it is unhappy The strongest argument which has been adduced to support this conjecture is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following passage in the opening of the third Georgic  Primus ego in patriam mecum modo vita supersit  Aonio rediens deducam vertice Musas  Primus Idumaeas referam tibi Mantua palmas  Et viridi in campo templum de marmore ponam  Propter aquam tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat  Mincius et tenerâ praetexit arundine ripas  In medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit c  These lines in which Virgil expresses his intention of dedicating a temple to Augustus have been considered as the  noblest allegory of ancient Poetry  Hurd's Horace volii page  and the great Critic who first started the idea has expatiated in the triumph of his discovery on the  mysterious  beauties they contain but the whole of this hypothesis is unfortunately built upon the rejection of three verses which are pronounced unworthy of the Poet and which though found in every MS the Critic claims a right of removing A licence so extraordinary cannot even be justified by the talents of this accomplished writer for if the less elegant passages of the ancient Poets might be removed at pleasure their compositions would be exposed to the caprice of every fantastic commentator The obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unnecessary but is more agreeable to the judgment of the Poet and the manners  of his age The custom of erecting real temples was so familiar to antiquity that a Roman would never have suspected the edifice was to be raised only with poetical materials We may even conjecture from a line of Statius that the Poet himself had a temple erected to his memory and without any breach of probability we may admit his intention of giving his living Emperor such a testimony of his gratitude This adulation though shocking to us was too generally justified by example to oblige the Poet to palliate it by a fiction He had before acquiesced in the divinity of his Imperial Patron and had expressed the idea in its full sense  Namque erit ille mihi semper  Deus  illius aram  Saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus  Eclog I  Ingredere et votis jam  nunc  assuesce vocari  Georg I  Having made such an invocation in the beginning of his Work was his  delicacy  afterwards to be shocked and oblige him to pay a compliment under the disguise of an obscure conceit for that allegory must be allowed to be obscure which had remained through so many ages unexplained The unfortunate rejected lines for whose elegance we do not contend may at least be rescued from impropriety by a literal interpretation of the preceding passage for dismiss the conjectured allegory and the chief objections against them remain no longer If the phraseology be peculiar it is at least supported by concurring MSS The adjective  ardens  is sometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a substance of heat or flame as the Critic himself admits in the case of  ardentes hostes  to which we may add the  verbum ardens  of Cicero As to the line which is said to contain the most glaring note of illegitimacy  Tithoni primâ quot abest ab origine Caesar  many reasons might induce the Poet to use the name of Tithonus which at this distance of time it is not easy for us to conjecture Perhaps  he chose it to vary the expression of  Assaraci Proles  which he had adopted in the preceding lines The absurdity of the subjectmatter and the place in which it is introduced that are insisted on as the principal objections arise solely from the allegorical hypothesis without it the construction will be plain and natural The Poet expresses his intention of erecting a temple to Augustus and expatiates on the magnificence with which it was to be adorned he then returns to his present poetical subject  Interea  Dryadum sylvas saltusque sequamur  and having dwelt a little on that to avoid too long a digression very naturally resumes the praises of the Emperor by alluding to the sublimer song which he intended to devote to him  hereafter  Mox  tamen ardentes accingar dicere pugnas  Caesaris  Perhaps the important position that gave rise to this conjecture and to others of a similar complexion "that the propriety of allegorical composition made the distinguished pride of ancient poetry" is as questionable as the conjecture itself and a diligent and judicious perusal of the ancient Poets might convince us that simplicity was their genuine character and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators Aristarchus indeed the celebrated model of ancient criticism rejected with great spirit the allegorical interpretations of Homer as we are informed by Eusthathius but the good Archbishop of Thessalonica who like some modern prelates had a passion for allegory censures the great Critic of Alexandria for his more simple mode of construction and supposes it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wisdom of the Poet    EUSTH vol iii page  NOTE VI VERSE  Shall History's pen to aid his vengeance won  There is hardly any eminent personage of antiquity who has suffered more from detraction both  in his literary and moral character than the poet Lucan His fate indeed seems in all points to have been peculiarly severe His early death at an age when few Poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work is itself sufficient to excite our compassion and regret but to perish by the envious tyranny of Nero may be considered as a blessing when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of Tacitus As I am persuaded that the great Historian has inadvertently adopted the grossest calumny against our Poet I shall most readily assign my reasons for thinking so It may first be proper to give a short sketch of Lucan's lifeHe was the son of Anneus Mela the youngest brother of Seneca and though born at Corduba was conveyed to Rome at the age of eight months a circumstance as his more indulgent critics observe which sufficiently refutes the censure of those who consider his language as provincial At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus so warmly celebrated by his disciple Persius the Satirist who was the intimate friend of our Poet In the close of his education Lucan is said to have passed some time at Athens On his return to Rome he rose to the office of Quaestor before he had attained the legal age He was afterwards inrolled among the Augurs and married a lady of noble birth of whose amiable character I shall speak more at large in a subsequent note Lucan had for some time been admitted to familiarity with Nero when the Emperor chose to contend for poetical honours by the public recital of a poem he had composed on Niobe and some verses of this imperial production are supposed to be preserved in the first Satire of Persius Lucan had the hardiness to repeat a poem on Orpheus in competition with that of Nero and what is more remarkable the judges of the contest were just and bold enough to decide against the Emperor From hence Nero became the persecutor of his successful rival and forbade him to produce any poetry in public The wellknown conspiracy of Piso against the tyrant soon followed and Tacitus with his usual sarcastic severity concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprize from the poetical injuries he had received a remark which does little credit to the candour of the Historian who might have found a much nobler and I will add a more probable motive for his conduct in the generous ardor of his character and his passionate adoration  of freedom In the sequel of his narration Tacitus alledges a charge against our Poet which if it were true must lead us to detest him as the most abject of mankind The Historian asserts that Lucan when accused of the conspiracy for some time denied the charge but corrupted at last by a promise of impunity and desirous to atone for the tardiness of his confession accused his mother Atilla as his accomplice This circumstance is so improbable in itself and so little consonant to the general character of Lucan that some writers have treated it with contempt as a calumny invented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence But the name of Tacitus has given such an air of authority to the story that it may seem to deserve a more serious discussion particularly as there are two subsequent events related by the same Historian which have a tendency to invalidate the accusation so injurious to our Poet The events I mean are the fate of Annaeus and the escape of Atilla the two parents of Lucan The former died in consequence of art accusation brought against him after the death of his son by Fabius Romanus who had been intimate with Lucan and forged some letters in his name with the design of proving his father concerned in the conspiracy These letters were produced to Nero who sent them to Annaeus from an eager desire says Tacitus to get possession of his wealth From this fact two inferences may be drawn according to the different lights in which it may be consideredIf the accusation against Annaeus was just it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his father and he appears the less likely to have endangered by his confession the life of a parent to whom he owed a still tenderer regardIf Annaeus was not involved in the conspiracy and merely put to death by Nero for the sake of his treasure we may the more readily believe that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice might calumniate the son from envy But the escape of Atilla affords us the strongest reason to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery of which Tacitus has supposed him guilty Had the Poet really named his mother as his accomplice would the vindictive and sanguinary Nero have spared the life of a woman whose family he detested particularly when other females were put to death for their share in the conspiracy That Atilla was not in that number the Historian himself informs us in the following remarkable sentence  Atilla mater Annaei Lucani sine absolutione sine supplicio dissimulata thus translated by Gordon "The information against Atilla the mother of Lucan was dissembled and without being cleared she escaped unpunished"  The preceding remarks will I hope vindicate to every candid mind the honour of our Poet whose firmness and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly displayed in that picture of his death which Tacitus himself has given us I shall present it to the English reader in the words of Gordon Lucan "while his blood issued in streams perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and stiffen and life to retire by little and little to the extremities while his heart was still beating with vital warmth and his faculties no wise impaired recollected some lines of his own which described a wounded soldier expiring in a manner that resembled this The lines themselves he rehearsed and they were the last words he ever uttered" The Annals of Tacitus Book xv The critics differ concerning the verses of the Pharsalia which the author quoted in so memorable a manner I shall transcribe the two passages he is supposed to have repeated and only add that Lipsius contends for the latter  Sanguis erant lacrymae quaecunque foramina novit  Humor ab his largus manat cruor ora redundant  Et patulae nares sudor rubet omnia plenis  Membra fluunt venis totum est pro vulnere corpus  Lib ix  Now the warm blood at once from every part  Ran purple poison down and drain'd the fainting heart  Blood falls for tears and o'er his mournful face  The ruddy drops their tainted passage trace  Where'er the liquid juices find a way  There streams of blood there crimson rivers stray  His mouth and gushing nostrils pour a flood  And e'en the pores ouze out the trickling blood  In the red deluge all the parts lie drown'd  And the whole body seems one bleeding wound  ROWE  Scinditur avulsus nec sicut vulnere sanguis  Emicuit lentus ruptis cadit undique venis  Discursusque animae diversa in membra meantis  Interceptus aquis  Lib iii v  No single wound the gaping rupture seems  Where trickling crimson wells in slender streams  But from an op'ning horrible and wide  A thousand vessels pour the bursting tide  At once the winding channel's course was broke  Where wand'ring life her mazy journey took  At once the currents all forgot their way  And lost their purple in the azure sea  ROWE  Such was the death of Lucan before he had completed his twentyseventh year If his character as a man has been injured by the Historian his poetical reputation has been treated not less injuriously by the Critics Quintilian by a frivolous distinction disputes his title to be classed among the Poets and Scaliger says with a brutality of language disgraceful only to himself that he seems rather to  bark  than to  sing  But these insults may appear amply compensated when we remember that in the most polished nations of modern Europe the most elevated and poetic spirits have been his warmest admirers that in France he was idolized by Corneille and in England translated by RoweThe severest censures on Lucan have proceeded from those who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil but how unjust and absurd is such a comparison it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry taken rough from the quarry to the most beautiful supersicies of polished marble How differently should we think of Virgil as a poet if we possessed only the verses which he wrote at that period of life when Lucan composed his Pharsalia In the disposition of his subject in the propriety and elegance of diction he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil but if we attend to the bold originality of his design and to the vigour of his sentiments if we consider the Pharsalia as the  rapid and uncorrected sketch of a young poet executed in an age when the spirit of his countrymen was broken and their taste in literature corrupted it may justly be esteemed as one of the most noble and most wonderful productions of the human mind  NOTE VII VERSE  As Lesbos paid to Pompey's lovely Wife  Pompey after his defeat at Pharsalia proceeded to Lesbos as he had left his wife Cornelia to the protection of that island which received the unfortunate hero with a sublime generosity The Lesbians entreated him to remain amongst them and promised to defend him Pompey expressed his gratitude for their fidelity but declined the offer and embarked with Cornelia The concern of this gallant people on the departure of their amiable guest is thus described by Lucan  dixit moestamque carinae  Imposuit comitem Cunctos mutare putares  Tellurem patriaeque solum sie litore toto  Plangitur infestae tenduntur in aethera dextrae  Pompeiumque minus cujus fortuna dolorem  Moverat ast illam quam toto tempore belli  Ut civem videre suam discedere cernens  Ingemuit populus quam vix si castra mariti  Victoris peteret siccis dimittere matres  Jam poterant oculis tanto devinxit amore  Hos pudor hos probitas castique modestia vultus  Lib viii v  He ceas'd and to the ship his partner bore  While loud complainings fill the sounding shore  It seem'd as if the nation with her pass'd  And banishment had laid their island waste  Their second sorrows they to Pompey give  For her as for their citizen they grieve  E'en though glad victory had call'd her thence  And her Lord's bidding been the just pretence  The Lesbian matrons had in tears been drown'd  And brought her weeping to their wat'ry bound  So was she lov'd so winning was her grace  Such lowly sweetness dwelt upon her face  ROWE  NOTE VIII VERSE  Let Argentaria on your canvass shine  Polla Argentaria was the daughter of a Roman Senator and the wife of Lucan She is said to have transcribed and corrected the three first books of the Pharsalia after the death of her husband It is much to be regretted that we possess not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accomplished woman but her name is immortalized by two surviving Poets of that age The veneration which she paid to the memory of her husband is recorded by Martial and more poetically described in that pleasing and elegant little production of Statius  Genethliacon Lucani  a poem which I the more readily commend as I may be thought by some readers unjust towards its author in omitting to celebrate his Thebaid I confess indeed the miscellaneous poems of Statius appear to me his most valuable work in most of these there is much imagination and sentiment in harmonious and spirited verse The little poem which I have mentioned on the anniversary of Lucan's birth is said to have been written at the request of Argentaria The Author after invoking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony touches with great delicacy and spirit on the compositions of Lucan's childhood which are lost and the Pharsalia the production of his early youth he then pays a short compliment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria laments the cruel fate which deprived her so immaturely of domestic happiness and concludes with the following address to the shade of Lucan  At tu seu rapidum poli per axem  Famae curribus arduis levatus  Qua surgunt animae potentiores  Terras despicis et sepulchra rides  Seu pacis meritum nemus reclusae  Felix Elysiis tenes in oris  Quo Pharsalica turba

triumphant car you rise  Where mightier souls new life assume  And mock the confines of the tomb  Or whether in Elysium blest  You grace the groves of sacred rest  Where she Pharsalian heroes dwell  And as you strike your Epic shell  The Pompeys and the Catos throng  To catch the animating song  Of Tartarus the dread controul  Binds not your high and hallow'd soul▪  Distant you hear that wailing coast  And see the guilty Nero's ghost  Grow pale with anguish and affright  His mother flashing on his sight  Be present to your Polla's vows  While to your honour'd name she bows  One day let your intreaties gain  From those who rule the shadowy train  Their gates have op'd to bless a wife  And given a husband back to life  In you the tender Fair invites  No fancied god with frantic rites  You are the object of her prayers  You in her inmost heart she bears  And stampt on mimic gold your head  Adorns the faithful mourner's bed  And sooths her eyes before they close  The guardian of her chaste repose  Away with all funereal state  From hence his nobler life we date  Let Mourning change the pang severe  To fond Devotion's grateful tear  And festal grief its anguish o'er  What it lamented now adore  I cannot close this note without observing that the preceding verses have a strong tendency to prove that Lucan was perfectly innocent in regard to the accusation which I have examined before Had he been really guilty of basely endangering the life of his mother it is not probable that his wife would have honoured his memory with such enthusiastic veneration or that Statius in verses designed to do him honour would have alluded to  the mother  of Nero The Reader will pardon my recurring to this subject as it is pleasing to make use of every argument which may remove so odious and unjust a stain from a manly and exalted character  NOTES TO THE THIRD EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  AND smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang  An allusion to  ridens moriar  the close of the

having patiently traced the obscure progress of Latin poetry through all the dark ages Indeed the merit of some Latin Poets in a period that we commonly suppose involved in the grossest barbarism is singularly striking many of these are of the Epic kind and as they describe the manners and customs of their respective times a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work I shall briefly mention such as appear most worthy of notice  Abbo a Parisian monk of the Benedictine order wrote a poem on the siege of Paris by the Normans and the Danes at which he was present in the year it is printed in the second volume of Duchesne's ScriptFrancorum and though it has little or no poetical merit may be regarded as an historical curiosity The following lines addressed to the city of Paris in the beginning of the work may serve as a specimen of its language  Dic igitur praepulchra polis quod Danea munus  Libavit tibimet soboles Plutonis amica  Tempore quo praesul domini et dulcissimus heros  Gozlinus temet pastorque benignus alebat  Haec inquit miror narrare potest aliquisne  Nonne tuis idem vidisti oculis refer ergo  Vidi equidem jussisque tuis parebo libenter  Leyser has confounded this Poet with another of this name but Fabricius has corrected the mistake in his Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Aetatis  Guido Bishop of Amiens from the year to wrote an Heroic poem on the exploits of William the Conqueror in which according to Ordericus Vitalis he imitated both Virgil and Statius William of Apulia composed at the request of Pope Urban the IId a poem in five books on the actions of the Normans in Sicily Apulia and Calabria to the death of Robert Guiscard their prince addressing  his work to the son of that hero It was written between the years and first printed in to and again in Muratori's Script Ital Du Cange in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Princess Anna Comnena has illustrated that history by frequent and long quotations from William of Apulia but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius his poetry appears to me but a few degrees superior to that of the Monk Abbo whom I have just mentioned The Reader may judge from the following passage which I select not only as a specimen of the Author's style but as it shews that the wives of these martial Princes shared with them in all the perils of war  Uxor in hoc bello Roberti forte sagitta  Quadam laesa fuit quae vulnere territa nullam  Dum sperabat opem se pene subegerat hosti  Navigio cujus se commendare volebat  Instantis metuens vicina pericula lethi  Hanc deus eripuit fieri ludibria nolens  Matronae tantae tam nobilis et venerandae  The Princess Comnena has also celebrated the fortitude which this Heroine whose name was Gaita displayed in the battle and it is remarkable that the royal female Historian describes the noble Amazon more poetically than the Latin Poet  Gualfredo an Italian who succeeded to the bishoprick of Siena in the year and died in wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne which is said to be still preserved in MS at Siena I believe Gualfredo is the first Poet in point of time who treated of the happy subject of the Crusades which was afterwards embellished by two very elegant writers of Latin verse Iscanus and Gunther of whom I shall presently speak and at length received its highest honour from the genius of Tasso There is also an early Latin poem on this subject the joint production of two writers named Fulco and Aegidius whom the accurate Fabricius places in the beginning of the th century the title of the work is Historia Gestorum Viae nostri Temporis Hierosolymitanae It is printed in the fourth volume of Duchesne's Script Franc and with considerable additions in the third volume of  Anecdota Edmundi Martene I transcribe part of the opening of this poem as the curious reader may have a pleasure in comparing it with that of Tasso  Ardor inest inquam sententia fixaque menti

Laurentius of Verona who flourished about the year wrote an Heroic poem in seven books entitled Rerum in Majorica Pisanorum Edidit Ughellus tom Italiae sacrae  But in merit and reputation these early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Philip Gualtier de Chatillon who seems to have been the first that caught any portion of true poetic spirit in Latin verse He was Provost of the Canons of Tournay  Fabricius calls him Episcopus Magalonensis Bib Lat tom ii p  about the year according to Mr Warton who has given some specimens of his style in the second Dissertation prefixed to his admirable History of English Poetry I shall therefore only add that the best edition of his Alexandreid an Heroic  poem in ten books on Alexander the Great was printed at Leyden to  The superior merit of Josephus Iscanus or Joseph of Exeter has been also displayed by the same judicious Encomiast in the Dissertation I have mentioned nor has he failed to commemorate two Latin Epic Poets of the same period and of considerable merit for the time in which they livedGunther and William of Bretagny the first was a German monk who wrote after the year and has left various historical and poetical works particularly two of the Epic kindSolymarium a poem on the taking of Jerusalem by Godfrey of Bulloign and another entitled Ligurinus on the exploits of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa which he completed during the life of that Prince The first was never printed of the latter there have been several editions and one by the celebrated Melancthon in That his poetical merit was considerable in many respects will appear from the following verses in which he speaks of himself  Hoc quoque me famae si desint caetera solum  Conciliare potest quod jam per multa latentes  Saecula nec clausis prodire penatibus ausas  Pierides vulgare paro priscumque nitorem  Reddere carminibus tardosque citare poetas  William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot natural son of Philip Augustus King of France and addressed a poem to his pupil entitled Karlotis which is yet unpublished but his greater work called Philippis an Heroic poem in twelve books is printed in the collections of Duchesne and Pithaeus and in a separate to volume with a copious commentary by Barthius Notwithstanding the praises bestowed on this Author by his learned Commentator who prefers him to all his contemporaries he appears to me inferior in poetic spirit to his three rivals Gualtier de Chatillon Iscanus and Gunther Yet his work is by no means despicable in its style and may be considered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived for he was himself engaged in many of the scenes which he describes His profest design is to celebrate the exploits of Philip Augustus and he closes his poem with the  death of that Monarch which happened in He addresses his work in two separate poetical dedications to Lewis the successor of Philip and to Pierre Charlot his natural son who was Bishop of Noyon in and died He seems to have been excited to this composition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid to which he thus alludes in the verses addressed to Lewis  Gesta ducis Macedum celebri describere versu  Si licuit Gualtere tibi quae sola relatu  Multivago docuit te vociferatio famae  Cur ego quae novi proprio quae lumine vidi  Non ausim magni magnalia scribere regis  Qui nec Alexandro minor est virtute nec illo  Urbi Rumuleae totum qui subdidit orbem  He takes occasion also in two other parts of his poem to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier to whom in poetical ability he confesses himself inferior but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow Of their respective talents the reader may judge who will compare the passage which Mr Warton has cited from the Alexandreid with the following lines in which William of Bretagny uses the very simile of his predecessor comparing his hero Philip to a young lion  Rex dolet ereptum comitem sibi frendit et irae  Occultare nequit tectos sub pectore motus  Nam rubor in vultu duplicatus prodit aperte  Quam gravis illustrem trahit indignatio mentem  Qualiter in Lybicis spumante leunculo rictu  Saltibus ungue ferox et dentibus asper

eleventh Book as it contains an animated portrait and a simile more original than the preceding  At laevo in cornu qui nulli marte secundus  Bolonides pugnae insistit cui fraxinus ingens  Nunc implet dextram vix ulli bajula qualem  In Bacchi legimus portasse Capanea cunas  Quam vix fulmineo dejecit Jupiter ictu  Nunc culter vitae impatiens nunc sanguine pugni  Mucro rubens gemina e sublimi vertice fulgens  Cornua conus agit superasque eduxit in auras  E costis assumpta nigris quas faucis in antro  Brachia balenae Britici colit incola ponti  Ut qui magnus erat magnae superaddita moli  Majorem faceret phantastica pompa videri  Ac velut in faltus scopulosa Bieria saltu  Praecipiti mittit ingenti corpore cervum  Cujus multifidos numerant a cornibus annos  Mense sub Octobri nondum Septembre peracto  Annua quando novis Venus incitat ignibus illum  Cursitat in cervos ramosa fronte minores  Omnibus ut pulsis victor sub tegmine fagi  Connubio cervam solus sibi subdat amatam  Haud secus e peditum medio quibus ipse rotundo  Ut castro cauta se circumsepserat arte  Prosiliens volat in Thomam Robertigenasque  Drocarum Comitem Belvacenumque Philippum  Bolonides  William of Bretagny had an immediate successor in Latin poetry who appears to have at least an equal portion of poetical spirit the name of this Author is Nicholas de Brai who wrote an Heroic poem on the actions of Louis the VIIIth after the death of that Monarch and addressed it to William of Auvergne who was Bishop of Paris from the year to As a specimen of his descriptive power I select the following lines which form part of a long description of a Goblet presented to the King on his accession  Parant intrare palatia regis  Magnifici cives gratissima dona ferentes  Tegmina quos ornant variis insculpta figuris  Et patrem patriae jucunda voce salutant  Et genibus flexis praesentant ditia dona  Offertur crater quem si sit credere dignum  Perditus ingenio fabricavit Mulciber auro  Margine crateris totus depingitur orbis  Et series rerum brevibus distincta figuris  Illic pontus erat tellus et pendulus aer  Ignis ad alta volans coeli supereminet illis  Quatuor in partes orbis distinguitur ingens  Circuit oceanus immensis fluctibus orbem  Ingenio natura suo duo lumina fecit  Fixa tenore poli mundi famulantia rebus  The Author proceeds to describe Thebes and Troy as they are figured on this superb Goblet and concludes his account of the workmanship with the four following lines of peculiar beauty for the age in which they appeared  Martis adulterium resupino margine pinxit  Mulciber et Venerem laqueis cum Marte ligavit  Pluraque caelasset sub margine sed pudor illi  Obstat et ingentis renovatur causa doloris  This Poem Which the author seems to have left imperfect is printed in the fifth volume of Duchesne's Script FrancorumEngland is said to have produced another Heroic Poet of considerable merit who celebrated in Latin verse the exploits of Richard the First and who was called Gulielmus Peregrinus from his having attended that Prince to the Holy Land Leland mentions him by the name of Gulielmus de Canno and Pits calls him Poetarum sui temporis apud nostrates facile Princeps but I do not find that his Work was ever printed nor do the several biographical writers who speak of him inform us where it exists in MS  In Italy the Latin language is supposed to have been cultivated with still greater success and the restoration of its purity is in great measure ascribed to Albertino Mussato whose merits were first displayed to our country by the learned author of the Essay on PopeMussato was a Paduan of high rank and great talents but unfortunate He died in exile and left besides many smaller Latin pieces an Heroic Poem De Gestis Italorum post Henricum VII Caesarem seu de Obsidione Domini Canis Grandis de Verona circa maenia Paduanae civitatis et Conflictu ejusQuadrio from whom I transcribe this title says it is printed in the tenth volume of Muratori Vossius who speaks of him as an Historian asserts that he commanded in the war which is the subject of his Poem  In a few years after the death of Mussato Petrarch received the laurel at Rome for his Latin Epic poem entitled Africa a performance which has sunk so remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained that the great admirer and encomiast of Petrarch who has published three entertaining quarto volumes on his life calls it "Un ouvrage sans chaleur sans invention sans interet qui n'a pas meme le merite de la versification du style dont il est impossible de soutenir la lecture I must observe however that Tasso in his Essay on Epic Poetry bestows a very high encomium on that part of Petrarch's Latin poem in which he celebrates the loves of Sophonisba and Masinissa and indeed the censure of this amiable French writer who in other points has done ample justice to the merits of Petrarch appears to me infinitely too severe There are many passages in this neglected Poem conceived with great force and imagination and expressed with equal elegance of language  I shall select some verses from that part of it which has been honoured by the applause of Tasso The following lines describe the anguish of the young Numidian Prince when he is constrained to abandon his lovely bride  Volvitur inde thoro quoniam sub pectore pernox  Saevit amor lacerantque truces praecordia curae  Uritur invigilant moeror metus ira furorque  Saepe absentem lacrymans dum stringit amicam  Saepe thoro dedit amplexus et dulcia verba  Postquam nulla valent violento fraena dolori  Incipit et longis solatur damna querelis  Cura mihi nimium vita mihi dulcior omni  Sophonisba vale non te mea cura videbo  Leniter aethereos posthac componere vultus  Effusosque auro religantem ex more capillos  Dulcia non caelum mulcentia verba Deosque  Oris odorati secretaque murmura carpam  Solus ero gelidoque insternam membra cubili  Atque utinam socio componat amica sepulchro  Et simul hic vetitos illic concorditer annos  Contingat duxisse mihi sors optima busti  Si cinis amborum commixtis morte medullis  Unus erit Scipio nostros non scindet amores  O utinam infernis etiam nunc una latebris  Umbra simus liceat pariter per claustra vagari  Myrtea nec nostros Scipio disjungat amores  Ibimus una ambo flentes et passibus iisdem  Ibimus aeterno connexi foedere nec nos  Ferreus aut aequos Scipio interrumpet amores  The wellknown catastrophe of the unfortunate Sophonisba is related with much poetical spirit The close of her life and her first appearance in the regions of the dead are peculiarly striking  Illa manu pateramque tenens lumina coelo  Attollens Sol alme inquit superique valete  Masinissa vale nostri memor inde malignum  Ceu sitiens haurit non mota fronte venenum  Tartareasque petit violentus spiritus umbras  Nulla magis Stygios mirantum obsessa corona  Umbra lacus subiit postquam divisa triformis  Partibus haud aequis stetit ingens machina mundi  Obtuitu attonito stabant horrentia circum  Agmina Poenarum sparsoque rigentia villo  Eumenidum tacitis inhiabant rictibus ora  Regia vis oculis inerat pallorque verendus  Et vetus egregia majestas fronte manebat  Indignata tamen superis irataque morti  Ibat et exiguo defigens lumina flexu  With Petrarch I may close this cursory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems in Latin during the course of the dark agesA peculiar circumstance induces me to add another name to the preceding list John Abbot of Peterborough in the reign of Edward the Third wrote an Heroic poem entitled Bellum Navarrense de Petro rege Aragoniae Edwardo Principe This performance containing five hundred and sixty verses is said to be preserved in MS in the Bodleian Library and I have thought it worthy of notice because it treats of the very subject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem  Of the many Latin compositions of the Epic kind which later times have produced the Christiad of Vida the Sarcotis of Massenius and the Constantine of Mambrun appear to me the most worthy of regard but even these are seldom perused and indeed the Poet who in a polished age prefers the use of a dead language to that of a living one can only expect and perhaps only deserves the attention of a few curious sequestered students  NOTE IV VERSE  Thy daring Dante his wild Vision sung  Dante Allighieri was born at Florence in May of an ancient and honourable family Boccacio who lived in the same period has left a very curious and entertaining Treatise on the Life the Studies and Manners of this extraordinary Poet whom he regarded as his master and for whose memory he professed the highest veneration This interesting biographer relates that Dante before he was nine years old conceived a passion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his singular Poem Her age was near his own and her name was Beatrice the daughter of Folco Portinari a noble citizen of Florence Of this fair one the best accounts are obscure Some refining commentators have even denied her corporeal existence affirming her to be nothing more or less than Theology But we may question if Theology was ever the mistress of so young a lover The passion of Dante however like that of his successor Petrarch seems to have been of the chaste and Platonic kind according to the account he has himself given of it in one of his early productions entitled Vita Nuova a mixture of mysterious poetry and prose in which he mentions both the origin of his affection and the death of his mistress who according to Boccacio died at the age of twentyfour The same author asserts that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in consequence of this event from which his friends endeavoured to raise him by persuading him to marriage After some time he followed their advice and repented it for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore some resemblance to the celebrated Xantippe The Poet not possessing the patience of Socrates separated himself from her with such vehement expressions of dislike that he never afterwards admitted her to his presence though she had borne him several childrenIn the early part of his life he gained some credit in a military character distinguishing himself by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a signal victory over the citizens of Arezzo He became still more eminent by the acquisition of civil honours and at the age of thirtyfive he rose to be one of the chief magistrates of Florence when that dignity was conferred by the suffrages of the people From this exaltation  the Poet himself dated his principal misfortunes as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni one of his early biographers where Dante speaks of his political failure with that liberal frankness which integrity inspiresItaly was at that time distracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs the latter among whom Dante took an active part were again divided into the Blacks and the Whites Dante says Gravina exerted all his influence to unite these inferior parties but his efforts were ineffectual and he had the misfortune to be unjustly persecuted by those of his own faction A powerful citizen of Florence named Corso Donati had taken measures to terminate these intestine broils by introducing Charles of Valois brother to Philip the Fair King of France Dante with great vehemence opposed this disgraceful project and obtained the banishment of Donati and his partizans The exiles applied to the Pope Boniface the VIIIth and by his assistance succeeded in their design Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph and those who had opposed his admission were banished in their turn Dante had been dispatched to Rome as the ambassador of his party and was returning when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city His enemies availing themselves of his absence had procured an iniquitous sentence against him by which he was condemned to banishment and his possessions were confiscated His two enthusiastic biographers Boccacio acid Manetti express the warmest indignation against this injustice of his country Dante on receiving the intelligence took refuge in Siena and afterwards in Arezzo where many of his party were assembled An attempt was made to surprize the city of Florence by a small army which Dante is supposed to have attended the design miscarried and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala Prince of Verona whom he has celebrated in his Poem The high spirit of Dante was ill suited to courtly dependence and he is said to have lost the favour of his Veroneze patron by the rough frankness of his behaviour From Verona he retired to France according to Manetti and Boccacio affirms that he disputed in the Theological Schools of Paris with great reputation Bayle questions his visiting Paris at this period of his life and thinks it improbable that a man who had been one of  the chief magistrates of Florence should condescend to engage in the public squabbles of the Parisian Theologists but the spirit both of Dante and the times in which he lived sufficiently account for this exercise of his talents and his residence in France at this season is confirmed by Boccacio in his life of our Poet which Bayle seems to have had no opportunity of consulting  The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire in November afforded Dante a prospect of being restored to his native city as he attached himself to the interest of the new Emperor in whose service he is supposed to have written his Latin treatise De Monarchia in which he asserted the rights of the Empire against the encroachments of the Papacy In the year he instigated Henry to lay siege to Florence in which enterprize says one of his Biographers he did not appear in person from motives of respect towards his native city The Emperor was repulsed by the Florentines and his death which happened in the succeeding year deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his reestablishment in Florence  After this disappointment he is supposed to have passed some years in roving about Italy in a state of poverty and distress till he found an honourable establishment at Ravenna under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta the lord of that city who received this illustrious exile with the most endearing liberality continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life and extended his munificence to the ashes of the Poet  Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante possessed in an eminent degree On this account he is said to have been employed on fourteen different embassies in the course of his life and to have succeeded in most of them His patron Guido had occasion to try his abilities in a service of this nature and dispatched him as his ambassador to negociate a peace with the Venetians who were preparing for hostilities against Ravenna Manetti asserts that he was unable to procure a public audience at Venice and returned to Ravenna by land from his apprehensions of the Venetian fleet when the fatigue of his journey and the mortification of failing in his attempt to preserve his generous patron from the impending danger threw him into a fever which terminated in death on the th of September He died however  in the palace of his friend and the affectionate Guido paid the most tender regard to his memory This magnificent patron says Boccacio commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments and after being carried on a bier through the streets of Ravenna by the most illustrious citizens to be deposited in a marble coffin He pronounced himself the funeral oration and expressed his design of erecting a splendid monument in honour of the deceased a design which his subsequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accomplish At his request many epitaphs Were written on the Poet the best of them says Boccacio by Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna a famous author of that time and the intimate friend of Dante Boccacio then cites a few Latin verses not worth transcribing six of which are quoted by Bayle as the composition of Dante himself on the authority of Paul Jovius In Bernardo Bembo the father of the celebrated Cardinal raised a handsome monument over the neglected ashes of the Poet with the following inscription  Exigua tumuli Danthes hic sorte jacebas  Squallenti nulli cognita paene situ  At nunc marmoreo subnixus conderis arcu  Omnibus et cultu splendidiore nites  Nimirum Bembus Musis incensus Etruscis  Hoc tibi quem in primis hae coluere dedit  Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna In the age of Leo the Xth they made a second attempt by a solemn application to the Pope for that purpose and the great Michael Angelo an enthusiastic admirer of Dante very liberally offered to execute a magnificent monument to the Poet The hopes of the Florentines were again unsuccessful The particulars of their singular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo  The person and manners of Dante are thus represented by the descriptive pen of Boccacia"Fu adunque questo nostro Pceta di Mezzana statura e poichè alla matura età fu pervenuto andò alquanto gravetto ed era il suo andar grave e mansueto di onestissimi panni sempre vestito  in quello abito che era alla sua matura età convenevole il suo volto  lungo il naso aquilino gli occhi anzi grossi che piccioli le mascelle grandi e dal labbro di sotto era quel di sopra avanzato il colore era bruno i capelli e la barba spessi neri e crespi e sempre nella faccia malinconico e pensosoNe costumi publici e domestici mirabilmente fu composto e ordinato più che niuno altro cortese e civile nel cibo  e nel poto fu modestissimoThough Dante is described as much inclined to melancholy and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and sublime yet in his early period of life he seems to have possessed all the lighter graces of sprightly composition as appears from the following airy and sportive sonnet  IMITATION  Henry I wish that you and Charles and I  By some sweet spell within a bark were plac'd  A gallant bark with magic virtue grac'd  Swift at our will with every wind to fly  So that no changes of the shifting sky  No stormy terrors of the watery waste  Might bar our course but heighten still our taste  Of sprightly joy and of our social tie  Then that my Lucy Lucy fair and free  With those soft nymphs on whom your souls are bent  The kind magician might to us convey  To talk of love throughout the livelong day  And that each fair might be as well content  As I in truth believe our hearts would be  A GUIDO CAVALCANTI  Guido vorrei che tu e Lappo ed io  Fossimo presi per incantamento  E messi ad un vassel ch'ad ogni vento  Per mare andasse a voler vostro e mio  Sicché fortuna od altro tempo rio  Non ci potesse dare impedimento  Anzi vivendo sempre in noi talento  Di stare insieme crescesse 'l disio  E monna Vanna e monna Bice poi  Con quella su il numer delle trenta  Con noi ponesse il buono incantatore  E quivi ragionar sempre d' amore  E ciascuna di lor fosse contenta  Siccome io credo che sariamo noi  These lively verses were evidently written before the Poet lost the object of his earliest attachment as she is mentioned by the name of Bice At what time and in what place he executed the great and singular work which has rendered him immortal his numerous Commentators seem unable to determine Boccacio asserts that he began it in his thirtyfifth year and had finished seven Cantos of his Inferno before his exile that in the plunder of his house on that event the beginning  of his poem was fortunately preserved but remained for some time neglected till its merit being accidentally discovered by an intelligent Poet named Dino it was sent to the Marquis Maroello Malespina an Italian nobleman by whom Dante was then protected The Marquis restored these lost papers to the Poet and intreated him to proceed in a work which opened in so promising a manner To this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of Dante which he must have continued  under all the disadvantages of an unfortunate and agitated life It does not appear at what time he completed it perhaps before he quitted Verona as he dedicated the Paradise to his Veronese patronThe Critics have variously accounted for his having called his poem Comedia He gave it that title said one of his sons because it opens with distress and closes with felicity The very high estimation in which this production was held by his country appears from a singular institution The republic of Florence in the year assigned a public stipend to a person appointed to read lectures on the poem of Dante Boccacio was the first person engaged in this office but his death happening in two years after his appointment his Comment extended only to the seventeen first Cantos of the inferno The critical dissertations that have been written on Dante are almost as numerous as those to which Homer has given birth the Italian like the Grecian Bard has been the subject of the highest panegyric and of the grossest invective Voltaire has spoken of him with that precipitate vivacity which so frequently led that lively Frenchman to insult the reputation of the noblest writers In one of his entertaining letters he says to an Italian Abbé "Je fais grand cas du courage avec lequel vous avez osé dire que Dante etoit un fou et son ouvrage un monstreLe Dante pourra entrer dans les bibliotheques des curieux mais il ne sera jamais lu" But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting to display the merits of this original Poet Mr Warton has introduced into his last volume on English Poetry a judicious and spirited summary of Dante's performance We have several versions of the celebrated story of Ugolino but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language though his whole work has been translated into French Spanish and Latin verse The three Cantos which follow were translated a few years ago to oblige a particular friend The Author has since been solicited to execute an entire translation of Dante but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render such a work a very laborious undertaking and it appears very doubtful how far such a version would interest our country Perhaps the reception of these Cantos may discover to the Translator the sentiments of the public At all events he flatters himself that the ensuing portion of a celebrated poem may afford some pleasure from its novelty as he has endeavoured to give the English reader an idea of  Dante's peculiar manner by adopting his triple rhyme and he does not recollect that this mode of versification has ever appeared before in our language it has obliged him of course to make the number of translated lines correspond exactly with those of the original The difficulties attending this metre will sufficiently shew themselves and obtain some degree of indulgence from the intelligent and candid reader  DELL' INFERNO  CANTO I  NEL mezzo del cammin di nostra vita  Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura  Che la diritta via era smarrita  E quanto à dir qual era è cosa dura  Questa selva selvaggia ed aspra e forte  Che nel pensier rinnuova la paura  Tanto è amara che poco è più morte  Ma per trattar del ben ch'i vi trovai  Dirò dell' altre cose ch'i v'ho scorte  I non so ben ridir com'i v'entrai  Tant'era pien di sonno in su quel punto  Che la verace via abbandonai  Ma po' ch'i fui al piè d'un colle giunto  Là ove terminava quella valle  Che m'avea di paura il cor compunto  Guarda'in alto e vidi le sue spalle  Vestite già de' raggi del pianeta  Che mena dritto altrui per ogni calle  Allor fu la paura un poco queta  Che nel lago del cor m'era durata  La notte ch'i passai con tanta pieta  E come quei che con lena affannata  Uscito fuor del pelago alla riva  Si volge all'aqua perigliosa e guata  Cosi l'animo mio ch'ancor fuggiva  Si vols' à retro à rimirar lo passo  Che non lasciò giammai persona viva  Poi ch'ebbi riposato il corpo lasso  Ripresi via per la piaggia deserta  Si che'l piè fermo sempre era'l più basso  Ed ecco quasi al cominciar dell' erta  Una lonza leggiera e presta molto  Che di pel maculato era coperta  E non mi si partia dinanzi al volto  Anz' impediva tanto 'l mio cammino  Ch'i fu per ritornar piu volte volto  Temp' era dal principio del mattino  E'l sol montava in su con quelle stelle  Ch'eran con lui quando l'amor divino  Mosse da prima quelle cose belle  Si ch'a bene sperar m'era cagione  Di quella fera la gaietta pelle  L'ora del tempo e la dolce stagione  Ma non si che paura non mi desse  La vista che m'apparve d'un leone  Questi parea che contra me venesse  Con la test'alta e con rabbiosa fame  Si che parea che l'aer ne temesse  Ed una lupa che di tutte brame  Sembiava carca con la sua magrezza  E molte genti fe' già viver grame  Questa mi porse tanto di gravezza  Con la paura ch'uscia di sua vista  Ch'i perde' la speranza dell' altezza  E quale è quei che volentieri acquista  E gingne 'l tempo che perder lo face  Che 'n tutt' i suoi pensier piange e s'attrista  Tal me fece la bestia senza pace  Che venendomi 'ncontro a poco a poco  Mi ripingeva là dove 'l sol tace  Mentre ch'i rovinava in basso loco  Dinanzi gli occhi mi si fu offerto  Chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco  Quando i' vidi costui nel gran diserto  Miserere di me gridai a lui  Qual che tu sii od ombra od uomo certo  Risposemi non uomo uomo già fui  E li parenti miei furon Lombardi  E Mantovani per patria

Poichè 'l superbo Ilion fu combusto  Ma tu perchè ritorni à tanta noja  Perchè non sali il dilettoso monte  Ch'è principio e cagion di tutta gioja  Or se' tu quel Virgilio e quella fonte  Che spande

e'l mio autore  Tu se' solo colui da cu'io tolsi  Lo bello stile che m'ha fatto onore  Vedi la bestia per cu'io mi volsi  Ajutami da lei famoso saggio  Ch'ella mi fa tremar le vene e i polsi  A te convien tenere altro viaggio  Rispose poichè lagrimar mi vide  Se vuoi campar d'esto luogo selvaggio  Che questa bestia per la qual tu gride  Non lascia altrui passar per la sua via  Ma tanto lo 'mpedisce che l'uccide  Ed ha natura sì malvagia e ria  Che mai non empie la bramosa voglia  E dopo 'l pasto ha più fame che pria  Molti son gli animali a cui s'ammoglia  E più saranno ancora infin

a me come persona accorta  Qui si convien lasciare ogni sospetto  Ogni viltà convien che qui sia morta  Noi sem venuti al luogo ov' i' t'ho detto  Che tu vedrai le genti dolorose  Ch'hanno perduto 'l

ch'i' non avrei mai creduto  Che morte tanta n' avesse disfatta  Poscia ch' io v'ebbi alcun riconosciuto  Guardai e vidi l'ombra di colui  Che fece per viltate il gran rifiuto  Incontanente intese e

DANTE  CANTO I  IN the mid season of this mortal strife  I found myself within a gloomy grove  Far wandering from the ways of perfect life  The place I know not where I chanc'd to rove  It was a wood so wild it wounds me sore  But to remember with what ills I strove  Such still my dread that death is little more  But I will tell the good which there I found  High things 'twas there my fortune to explore  Yet how I enter'd on that secret ground  I know not to explain so much in sleep  My mortal senses at that hour were drown'd  But when I reach'd the bottom of a steep  That rose to terminate the dreary vale  Which made cold terrors thro' my bosom creep  I look'd on high where breath'd a purer gale  And saw the summit glisten with that ray  Which leads the wand'rer safe o'er hill and dale  This soon began to chase those fears away  Which held my struggling spirit bound so fast  During that night of darkness and dismay  And as th' exhausted wretch by fortune cast  Safe from the stormy deep upon the shore  Turns to survey the perils he has past  So turn'd my soul ere yet its dread was o'er  Back to contemplate that mysterious strait  Where living mortal never past before  Arising soon from this repose elate  Up the rough steep my journey I begin  My lower foot sustaining all my weight  Here while my toilsome way I slowly win  Behold a nimble Panther springs to sight  And beauteous spots adorn his motley skin  He at my presence shew'd no signs of fright  But rather strove to bar my doubtful way  I often turn'd and oft resolv'd on flight  'Twas now the chearful hour of rising day  The sun advanc'd in that propitious sign  Which first beheld his radiant beams display  Creation's charms the work of love divine  So that I now was rais'd to hope sublime  By these bright omens of a fate benign  The beauteous Beast and the sweet hour of prime  But soon I lost that hope and shook yet more  To see a Lion in this lonely clime  With open jaws athirst for human gore  He rush'd towards me in his hungry ire  Air seem'd to tremble at his savage roar  With him enflam'd with every fierce desire  A famish'd Shewolf like a spectre came  Beneath whose gripe shall many a wretch expire  Such sad oppression seiz'd my sinking frame  Such horror at these strange tremendous sights  My hopes to climb the hill no longer aim  But as the wretch whom lucre's lust incites  In the curst hour which scatters all his wealth  Sinks in deep sorrow dead to all delights  So was I robb'd of all my spirit's health  And to the quarter where the sun grows mute  Driven by this Beast who crept on me by stealth  While I retreated from her dread pursuit  A manly figure my glad eyes survey'd  Whose voice was like the whisper of a lute  Soon as I saw him in this dreary glade  Take pity on me to this form I cry'd  Be thou substantial man or fleeting shade  A man I was the gracious form reply'd  And both my parents were of Lombard race  They in their native Mantua liv'd and dy'd  I liv'd at Rome rich in a monarch's grace  Beneath the good Augustus' letter'd reign  While fabled Gods were serv'd with worship base  A Bard I was the subject of my strain  That just and pious Chief who sail'd from Troy  Sinking in ashes on the sanguine plain  But thou whom these portentous sights annoy  Why dost thou turn why not ascend the mount  Source of all good and summit of all joy  Art thou that Virgil thou that copious fount  Of richest eloquence so clear so bright  I answer'd blushing at his kind account  O thou of Poets the pure guide and light  Now let me profit by that fond esteem  Which kept thy song for ever in my sight  Thou art my Master thou my Bard supreme  From whom alone my fond ambition drew  That purer style which I my glory deem  O from this Beast so hideous to the view  Save me O save me thou muchhonour'd Sage  For growing terrors all my power subdue  A different road must lead thee from her rage  He said observant of my starting tears  And from this wild thy spirit disengage  For that terrific Beast which caus'd thy fears  Worries each wretch that in her road she spies  Till death at length his sole relief appears  So keen her nature sleep ne'er seals her eyes  Her ravenous hunger no repast can sate  Food only serves to make its fury rise  She calls from different animals her mate  And long shall she produce an offspring base  Then from a mighty victor meet her fate  Nor pomp nor riches shall that victor grace  But truth and love and all excelling worth  He from his rescu'd land all ill shall chase  The saviour of the realm that gives him birth  Of Italy for whom Camilla fell  And Turnus fighting for his native earth  And Ninus with the friend he lov'd so well  The Beast this victor to that den shall drive  Whence Envy let her loose her native hell  Now for thy good wellpleas'd I will contrive  That by my aid while I thy steps controul  Thou shalt in safety at those realms arrive  Where thou shalt see the tortur'd spirits roll  And hear each mourn his miserable fate  Calling for death on his immortal soul  Then shalt thou visit those who in a state  Of purifying fire are still content  And for their promis'd heaven submissive wait  If to that heaven thy happy course is bent  A worthier guard will soon my place supply  A purer spirit for thy guidance sent  For that Immortal Power who rules on high  Because I ne'er his perfect laws have known  His sacred presence will to me deny  There in the realms of light he fix'd his throne  There o'er the world Almighty Lord he reigns  O blest the servant whom he deigns to own  Poet I answer'd by thy living strains  And by that God tho' not reveal'd to thee  That I may 'scape from these and heavier pains  Be thou my leader where thy way is free  So that my eyes St Peter's gate may find  And all the wonders of the deep may see  He led and I attentive march'd behind  CANTO II  THE day was sinking and the dusky air  On all the animals of earth bestow'd  Rest from their labours I alone prepare  To meet new toil both from my dreary road  And pious wish to paint in worthy phrase  The Unerring Mind and his divine abode  O sacred Muses now my genius raise  O Memory who writest what I saw  From hence shall spring thy everduring praise  Kind Poet I began with trembling awe  Mark if my soul be equal to this aim  Nor into scenes too hard my weakness draw  Thy Song declares the Chief of pious fame  Appear'd among the blest retaining still  His mortal senses and material frame  Yet if the great Opposer of all ill  Shew'd grace to him as knowing what and who  Should from him rise and mighty things fulfil  Most worthy he appear'd in Reason's view  That Heaven should chuse him as the Roman Sire  Source of that empire which so widely grew  Mark'd in its growth by the angelic choir  To be the seat where Sanctity should rest  And Peter's heirs yet raise dominion higher  From his dark journey in thy Song exprest  He learn'd mysterious things from whence arose  Rome's early grandeur and the Papal vest  To Paul while living heaven's high powers disclose  Their secret bliss that he may thence receive  strength in that faith from which salvation flows  But how may I this high exploit atchieve  I'm not Aeneas nor the holy Paul  Of this unworthy I myself believe  If then I follow at thy friendly call  Midway perchance my trembling soul may sink  Wise as thou art thou may'st foresee my fall  Now as a man who shudd'ring on the brink  Of some great venture sudden shifts his mind  And feels his spirit from the peril shrink  So in this scene of doubt and darkness join'd  Wavering I wasted thought in wild affright  And the first ardour of my soul resign'd  If thy faint words I understand aright  Reply'd the mighty and magnanimous shade  Those mists of fear have dimm'd thy mental sight  Which oft the seat of human sense invade  And make blind mortals from high deeds recoil  By Terror's airy phantasies betray'd  But that such fears thy soul no more may soil  I'll tell thee whence I came at whose request  When first I pitied thy uncertain toil  From the suspended host in which I rest  A lovely Spirit call'd me fair as light  Eager I waited on her high behest  While eyes beyond the solar radiance bright  And with the sweetness of an angel's tongue  Thus her soft words my willing aid invite  O ever gentle shade from Mantua sprung  Whose fame unfading on the earth shall last  As long as earth in ambient air is hung  My friend whose love all base desire surpast  In yon drear desart finds his passage barr'd  And compass'd round with terrors stands aghast  And much I fear beset with dangers hard  He may be lost beyond all friendly reach  And I from heaven descend too late a guard  But go and with thy soft soulsoothing speech  And all the aid thy wisdom may inspire  The ways of safety to this wanderer teach  My name is Beatrice the heavenly quire  For this I left tho' ever left with pain  But love suggested what I now desire  When I the presence of my lord regain  On thee my praises with delight shall dwell  So spake this angel in her heavenly strain  Bright Fair I cry'd who didst on earth excel  All that e'er shone beneath the lunar sphere  And every mind to virtuous love impel  Had I e'en now perform'd the task I hear  That swift performance I should think too slow  Nor needs there more your gracious will is clear  Yet how you venture I would gladly know  From those pure realms to which again you fly  So near the center of eternal woe  What you require she said in kind reply  I briefly will explain how thus I dare  Unconscious of alarm these depths to try  From these things only springs our fearful care  By which our hapless friends may suffer ill  But not from other for no fear is there  Such am I form'd by Heaven's most gracious will  That torture cannot touch my purer frame  E'en where fierce fires his flaming region fill  A gentle spirit Lucia is her name  In heaven laments the hardships of my friend  For whom I ask your aid to me she came  And kindly bade me to his woes attend  Behold she said thy servant in distress  And I his safety to thy care commend  Lucia the friend of all whom ills oppress  Me where I sate with pensive Rachel sought  In heavenly contemplation's deep recess  In mercy's name she cry'd thus lost in thought  Seest thou not him who held thy charms so dear  Whom Love to rise above the vulgar taught  And dost thou not his lamentation hear  Nor see the horror which his strength impairs  On yon wide torrent with no haven near  Never was mind intent on worldly cares  So eager wealth to gain or loss to shun  As when acquainted with these deadly snares  I flew from the blest confines of the sun  Trusting that eloquence which to thy name  And to thy followers such praise has won  She having thus explain'd her gracious aim  Turn'd her bright eyes which tears of pity fill  And hence more swift to thy relief I came  And pleas'd to execute her heavenly will  I sav'd thee from the fury of that Beast  Which barr'd thy journey up the brighter hill  Why then O why has all thy ardour ceas'd  And whence this faintness in thy feeble mind  Why has its noble energy decreas'd  When these pure Spirits for thy good combin'd  Watch o'er thy safety in their heavenly seat  And I reveal the favour thou shalt find  As tender flowers reviv'd by solar heat  That thro' the chilling night have sunk deprest  Rise and unfold the welcome ray to meet  So rose my spirit of new life possest  And my warm heart on high atchievements bent  I thus my animating guide addrest  Gracious that Spirit who thy succour sent  And friendly thou who freely hast display'd  Thy zeal to execute her kind intent  Thy soothing words have to my soul convey'd  Such keen desire to those bright realms to soar  I scorn the terror that my step delay'd  Now leadthy pleasure I dispute no more  My lord my master thou and thou my guard  I ended here and while he march'd before  The gloomy road I enter'd deep and hard  CANTO III  "THRO' me you pass to Mourning's dark domain  Thro' me to scenes where Grief must ever pine  Thro' me to Misery's devoted train  Justice and power in my Great Founder join  And love and wisdom all his fabrics rear  Wisdom above controul and love divine  Before me Nature saw no works appear  Save works eternal such was I ordain'd  Quit every hope all ye who enter here"  These characters where misty darkness reign'd  High o'er a lofty gate I saw engrav'd  Ah Sire said I hard things are here contain'd  He sapient Guide my farther question sav'd  With spirit answering "Here all doubt resign  All weak distrust and every thought deprav'd  At length we've reach'd that gloomy drear confine  Where as I said thou'lt see the mournful race  For ever robb'd of Reason's light benign"  Then stretching forth his hand with gentle grace  From whence new comfort through my bosom flows  He led me in to that mysterious place  There sighs and wailings and severest woes  Deeply resounded through the starless air  And as I first advanc'd my fears arose  Each different cry the murmuring notes of care  Accents of misery and words of ire  With all the sounds of discord and despair  To form such tumult in this scene conspire  As flies for ever round the gloomy waste  Like sand when quicken'd by the whirlwind's fire  I then my mind with error still disgrac'd  Exclaim'dO Sire what may this trouble mean  What forms are these by sorrow so debas'd  He soon reply'dBehold these bounds between  All who without or infamy or fame  Clos'd the blank business of their mortal scene  They join those angels of ignoble name  Who not rebell'd yet were not faithful found  Without attachment self alone their aim  Heaven shuts them out from its unsullied bound  And Hell refuses to admit this train  Lest e'en the damn'd o'er these their triumph sound  O Sire said I whence then this grievous pain  That on our ears their lamentations grate  This he reply'd I will in brief explain  These have no hope that death may mend their fate  And their blind days form so confus'd a mass  They pine with envy of each other's state  From earth their name has perish'd like the grass  E'en Mercy views them with a scornful eye  We'll speak of them no more Behold and pass  I look'd and saw a banner rais'd on high  That whirl'd unconscious of a moment's stand  With rapid circles in the troubled sky  Behind it driven by Fate's supreme command  Came such a host I ne'er could have believ'd  Death had collected so complete a band  When now I had the forms of all perceiv'd  I saw the shade of that ignoble priest  Of sovereign power by indolence bereav'd  Instant I knew from every doubt releas'd  These were the base the miscreated crew  To whom the hate of God had never ceas'd  Vile forms ne'er honor'd with existence true  Naked they march'd and sorely were they stung  By wasps and hornets that around them flew  These the black blood from their gall'd faces wrung  Blood mixt with tears that trickling to their feet  Fed the fastidious worms which round them clung  When now I farther pierc'd the dark retreat  Numbers I saw beside a mighty stream  Sudden I cry'dNow Sire let me entreat  To know what forms in distant prospect seem  To pass so swiftly o'er a flood so wide  As I discern by this imperfect gleam  That shalt thou know return'd my gracious Guide  When the near respite from our toil we reach  On sullen Acheron's infernal tide  With downcast eyes that pardon now beseech  And hoping silence may that pardon win  E'en to the river I abstain'd from speech  And lo towards us with a shrivell'd skin  A hoary boatman steers his crazy bark  Exclaiming "Woe to all ye sons of sin  Hope not for heaven nor light's celestial spark  I come to wast you to a different lot  To Torture's realm with endless horror dark  And thou who living view'st this sacred spot  Haste to depart from these for these are dead"  But when he saw that I departed not  In wrath he cry'd "Thro' other passes led  Not here shalt thou attempt the farther shore  But in a bark to bear thy firmer tread"  O Charon said my Guide thy strife give o'er  For thus 'tis will'd in that superior scene  Where will is power Seek thou to know no more  Now grew the bearded visage more serene  Of the stern boatman on the livid lake  Whose eyes so lately glar'd with anger keen  But all the naked shades began to quake  Their shuddering figures grew more pale than earth  Soon as they heard the cruel words he spake  God they blasphem'd their parents' injur'd worth  And all mankind the place the hour that saw  Their first formation and their future birth  Then were they driven by Fate's resistless law  Weeping to that sad scene prepar'd for all  Who fear not God with pure devotion's awe  Charon with eyes of fire and words of gall  Collects his crew and high his oar he wields  To strike the tardy wretch who slights his call  As leaves in autumn thro' the woody fields  Fly in succession when each trembling tree  Its ling'ring honors to the whirlwind yields  So this bad race condemn'd by Heaven's decree  Successive hasten from that river's side  As birds which at a call to bondage flee  So are they wafted o'er the gloomy tide  And ere from thence their journey is begun  A second crew awaits their hoary guide  My gracious Master kindly saidMy son  All those who in the wrath of God expire  From every clime haste hither one by one  Nor would their terrors from this stream retire  Since heavenly justice so impels their mind  That fear is quicken'd into keen desire  Here may no spirit pass to good inclin'd  And hence if Charon seem'd to thwart thy will  Hence wilt thou deem his purpose not unkind  He paus'd and horrors of approaching ill  Now made the mournful troop so stand aghast  Their fears yet strike me with a deadly chill  The groaning earth sent forth a hollow blast  And flash'd a fiery glare of gloomy red  The horrid scene my fainting power surpast  I fell and as in sleep my senses fled  NOTE V VERSE  The gay Boccacio tempts th' Italian Muse  Boccacio was almost utterly unknown to our country as a Poet when two of our most accomplished Critics restored his poetical reputation  Mr Tyrwhitt to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator has given a sketch of Boccacio's Theseida in his introductory discourse to the Canterbury Tales and Mr Warton has enriched the first volume of his History of English Poetry with a considerable specimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem of which our country is said to possess but a single copyThe father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant a native of Certaldo near Florence who in his travels attached himself to a young woman of Paris and our Poet is supposed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection He was born in and educated as a student of the canon law but a sight of Virgil's tomb according to Filippo Villani his most ancient Biographer made him resolve to relinquish his more irksome pursuits and devote himself entirely to the Muses His life seems to have been divided between literature and love as he was equally remarkable for an amorous disposition and a passionate attachment to study His most celebrated mistress was Mary of Arragon the natural daughter of Robert King of Naples the generous and enthusiastic patron of Petrarch To this lady distinguished by the name of The Fiammetta Boccacio addressed his capital poem the Theseida telling her in an introductory letter that it contained many allusions to the particular circumstances of their own secret attachment In his latter days he retired to Certaldo and died there in the year of a disorder supposed to have arisen from excessive application Few authors have rendered more essential service to the republic of letters than Boccacio as he not only contributed very much to the improvement of his native language but was particularly instrumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning a merit which he shared with Petrarch The tender and generous friendship which subsisted between these two engaging authors reflects the highest honour on both and their letters to each other may be ranked among the most interesting productions of that period Boccacio composed according  to Quadrio no less than thirtyfour volumes His Novels are universally known his Poetical Works are as follow La Theseida in Ottava Rima L'Amorosa Visione in Terza Rima Il Filostrato in Ottava Rima Il Ninfale Fiesolano in Ottava RimaHe piqued himself on being the first Poet who sung of martial subjects in Italian verse and he has been generally supposed the inventor of the Ottava Rima the common Heroic measure of the Italian Muse but Quadrio has shewn that it was used by preceding writers and Pasquier in his Recherches has quoted two stanzas of Thibaud king of Navarre written in the same measure on Blanch queen of France who died in The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen appears the more striking as he peculiarly prided himself on his poetical character informing the world by an inscription on his tomb that Poetry was his favourite pursuitStudium fuit alma Poesis are the last words of the epitaph which he composed for himself  NOTE VI VERSE  She spoke exulting and Trissino sung  Giovanni Giorgio Trissino was born of a noble family in Vicenza he was particularly distinguished by a passion for Poetry and Architecture and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace This he is said to have done from a design of his own under the direction of the celebrated Palladio He had the merit of writing the first regular tragedy in the Italian language entitled Sophonisba but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed though some learned Critics and Gravina amongst them have endeavoured to support the credit of that performance His subject was the expulsion of the Goths from Italy by Belisarius and his poem consists of twentyseven books in blank verse He addressed it to the Emperor Charles the Vth and professes in his Dedication to have taken Aristotle for his preceptor and Homer for his guide  The reader will excuse a trifling anachronism in my naming Trissino before Ariosto for poetical reasons The Italia Liberata of the former was first published in the Orlando Furioso in Trissino died at Rome Ariosto at Ferrara  NOTE VII VERSE  Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son  The reputation of Torquato Tasso has almost eclipsed that of his father Bernardo who was himself a considerable Poet and left two productions of the Epic kind L'Amadigi and Il Floridante the latter remained unfinished at his death but was afterwards published in its imperfect state by his son who has spoken of his father's poetry with filial regard in his different critical works The Amadigi was written at the request of several Spanish Grandees in the court of Charles the Vth and first printed in Venice by Giolito The curious reader may find an entertaining account of the Author's ideas in composing this work among his Letters volume the first page I cannot help remarking that the letter referred to contains a simile which Torquato has introduced in the opening of his Jerusalem Delivered  The Italians have formed a very pleasing and valuable work by collecting the letters of their eminent Painters which contain much information on points relating to their art The letters of their Poets if properly selected might also form a few interesting volumes as a proof of this I shall insert a short letter of the younger Tasso because it seems to have escaped the notice of his Biographers and relates the remarkable circumstance of his having deliberated on five different subjects before he decided in favour of Goffredo  Al M Illustre Sig Conte Ferrante Estense Tassone  Io ho scritto questa mattina a V S che io desidero di far due Poemi a mio gusto e sebben per elezione non cambierei il soggetto che una volta presi nondimeno per soddisfar il signor principe gli do l' elezione di tutti questi soggetti i quali mi paijono sovra gli altri atti a ricever la forma eroica  Espedizion di Goffredo e degli altri principi contra gl' Infedeli e ritorno Dove avrò occasione di lodar le famiglie d' Europa che io vorrò  Espedizion di Belisario contra i Goti  Di Narsete contra i Goti e discorro d' un principe E in questi  vrei grandissima occasione di lodar le cose di Spagna e d' Italia e di Grecia e l' origine di casa d' Austria  Espedizion di Carlo il magno contra Lansoni  Espedizion di Carlo contra i Longobardi In questi troverei l' origine di tutte le famiglie grandi di Germania di Francia e d' Italia e 'l ritorno d' un principe  E sebben alcuni di questi soggetti sono stati presi non importa perche io cercherei di trattargli neglio e a gindicio d' Aristotele  Opere di Torquato Tasso tom ix p  This letter is the more worthy of notice as the subject on which Tasso fixed has been called by Voltaire and perhaps very justly Le plus grand qu'on ait jamais choisi Le Tasse l'a  traité dignement adds the lively Critic with unusual candour yet in his subsequent remarks he is peculiarly severe on the magic of the Italian Poet The merits of Tasso are very ably defended against the injustice of French criticism and particularly that of Boileau and Voltaire in the wellknown Letters on Chivalry and Romance Indeed the genius of this injured Poet seems at length to triumph in the country where he was most insulted as the French have lately attempted a poetical version of his Jerusalem  I enter not into the history of Tasso or that of his rival Ariosto because the public has lately received from Mr Hoole a judicious account of their lives prefixed to his elegant versions of their respective Poems  NOTE VIII VERSE  Shall gay Tassoni want his festive crown  Alessandro Tassoni the supposed inventor of the modern Heroicomic Poetry was born at Modena His family was noble but his parents dying during his infancy left him exposed to vexatious lawsuits which absorbed a great part of his patrimony and rendered him dependant In he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal Ascanio Colonna whom he attended on an embassy into Spain He was occasionally dispatched into Italy on the service of that Prelate and in the course of one of these expeditions wrote his Observations on Petrarch In he is supposed  to have quitted the service of the Cardinal and to have lived in a state of freedom at Rome where in he became the chief of a literary society entitled Academia degli Umoristi He was afterwards employed in the service of Charles Emanuel Duke of Savoy which after suffering many vexations in it he quitted with a design of devoting himself to study and retirement But this design he was induced to relinquish and to serve the Cardinal Lodovisio nephew of Pope Gregory XV from whom he received a considerable stipend On the death of this patron in he was recalled to his native city by Francis the First Duke of Modena and obtained an honourable establishment in the court of that Prince Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune his health declined in the year of his return and he expired in April His genius was particularly disposed to lively satire and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increase that disposition After having passed many vexatious and unprofitable years in the service of the Great he had his portrait painted with a fig in his hand and Muratori supposes him to have written these two lines on the occasion  Dextera cur ficum quaeris mea gestet inanem  Longi operis merces haec fuit aula dedit  His celebrated Poem La Secchia rapita was written as he has himself declared in begun in April and finished in October It was circulated in MS received with the utmost avidity and first printed at Paris In a catalogue of the numerous editions of the Secchia which Muratori has prefixed to his Life of Tassoni he includes an English translation of it printed  NOTE IX VERSE  And rashly judges that her Vega's lyre  The famous Lope de Vega frequently called the Shakespear of Spain is perhaps the most fertile Poet in the annals of Parnassus and it would be difficult to name any author ancient or modern so universally idolized while living by all ranks of people and so magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great He was the son of Felix de Vega and Francisca Fernandez  who were both descended from honourable families and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid Our Poet was born in that city on the th of November He was according to his own expression a Poet from his cradle and beginning to make verses before he had learned to write he used to bribe his elder schollfellows with a part of his breakfast to commit to paper the lines he had composed Having lost his father while he was still a child he engaged in a frolic very natural to a lively boy and wandered with another lad to various parts of Spain till having spent their money and being conducted before a magistrate at Segovia for offering to sell a few trinkets they were sent home again to Madrid Soon after this adventure our young Poet was taken under the protection of Geronimo Manrique Bishop of Avila and began to distinguish himself by his dramatic compositions which were received with great applause by the public though their author had not yet completed his education for after this period he became a member of the university of Alcala where he devoted himself for four years to the study of philosophy He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron who is frequently mentioned in his Occasional Poems He quitted that employment on his marriage with Isabel de Urbina a lady says his friend and biographer Perez de Montalvan beautiful without artifice and virtuous without affectation His domestic happiness was soon interrupted by a painful incidentHaving written some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom with his character he received a challenge in consequence of his wit and happening in the duel which ensued to give his adversary a dangerous wound he was obliged to fly from his family and shelter himself in Valencia He resided there a considerable time but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid His wife died in the year of his return His affliction on this event led him to relinquish his favourite studies and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the invasion of England He had a brother who served in that fleet as a lieutenant and being shot in an engagement with some Dutch vessels his virtues were celebrated by our afflicted Poet whose heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection After the ill success of the Armada the disconsolate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid and became Secretary to the Marquis  of Malpica to whom he has addressed a grateful Sonnet From the service of this Patron he passed into the household of the Count of Lemos whom he celebrates as an inimitable Poet He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great for the more inviting comforts of a married life His second choice was Juana de Guardio of noble birth and singular beauty By this lady he had two children a son who died in his infancy and a daughter named Feliciana who survived her father The death of his little boy is said to have hastened that of his wife whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven years after his marriage Having now experienced the precariousness of all human enjoyments he devoted himself to a religious life and fulfilled all the duties of it with the most exemplary piety still continuing to produce an astonishing variety of poetical compositions His talents and his virtues procured him many unsolicited honours Pope Urban the VIIIth sent him the Cross of Malta with the title of Doctor in Divinity and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apostolic Chamber favours for which he expressed his gratitude by dedicating his Corona Tragica a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots to that liberal Pontiff In his seventythird year he felt the approaches of death and prepared himself for it with the utmost composure and devotion His last hours were attended by many of his intimate friends and particularly his chief patron the Duke of Sessa whom he made his executor leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana and of his various manuscripts The manner in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting He said to his Disciple and Biographer Montalvan That true fame consisted in being good and that he would willingly exchange all the applauses he had received to add a single deed of virtue to the actions of his life Having given his dying benediction to his daughter and performed the last ceremonies of his religion he expired on the th of August  The splendor of his funeral was equal to the respect paid to him while livingHis magnificent patron the Duke of Sessa invited the chief nobility of the kingdom to attend it The ceremony was prolonged through the course of several days and three sermons in honour of the deceased were delivered by three of the most celebrated preachers These  are printed with the works of the Poet and may be considered as curious specimens of the false eloquence which prevailed at that time A volume of encomiastic verses chiefly Spanish and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the most distinguished characters in Spain was published soon after the death of this lamented Bard To this collection his friend and disciple Perez de Montalvan prefixed a circumstantial account of his life and death which I have chiefly followed in the preceding narrative An ingenious Traveller who has lately published a pleasing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain has imputed the duel in which Lope de Vega was engaged to the gallantries of his first wife but Montalvan's relation of that adventure clears the honor of the lady whose innocence is still farther supported by a poem written in her praise by Pedro de Medina Medinilla it is printed in the works of our Poet who is introduced in it under the name of Belardo celebrating the excellencies and lamenting the loss of his departed Isabel  Of the person and manners of Lope de Vega his friend Montalvan has only given this general accountthat his frame of body was particularly strong and preserved by temperance in continued healththat in conversation he was mild and unassuming courteous to all and to women peculiarly gallantvery eager when engaged in the business of his friends and somewhat careless in the management of his own Of his wealth and charity I shall have occasion to speak in a subsequent note The chief expences in which he indulged himself were books and pictures of the latter he distributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends to the Duke of Sessa a fine portrait of himself and to me says Montalvan another painted when he was young surrounded by dogs monkies and other monsters and writing in the midst of them without attending to their noiseOf the honours paid to this extraordinary Poet his Biographer asserts that no person of eminence visited Spain without seeking his personal acquaintance that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the streets and women saluted him with benedictions when he passed under their windows If such homage can be deserved by the most unwearied application to poetry Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it He declared that he constantly wrote five sheets a day and his biographers who have formed a calculation from this account conclude the number of his verses to be  no less than His country has very lately published an elegant edition of his poems in quarto volumes his dramatic works are to be added to this collection and will probably be still more voluminous I shall speak only of the formerAmong his poems there are several of the Epic kind the three following appear to me the most remarkable La Dragontea La Hermosura de Angelica La Jerusalem Conquistada The Dragontea consists of ten cantos on the last expedition and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake whom the Poet from his excessive partiality to his country considers as an avaricious pirate or rather as he chuses to call him a marine Dragon and it may be sufficient to observe that he has treated him accordingly The poem on Angelica seems to have been written in emulation of Ariosto and it is founded on a hint in that Poet it was composed in the early part of our Author's life and contains many compliments to his sovereign Philip the IId it consists of cantos and closes with Angelica's being restored to her beloved Medoro In his Jerusalem Conquistada he enters the lists with Tasso whom he mentions in his preface as having sung the first part of the history which he had chosen for his subject From the great name of Lope de Vega I had some thoughts of presenting to the reader a sketch of this his most remarkable poem but as an Epic Poet he appears to me so much inferior to Tasso and to his countryman and cotemporary Ercilla that I am unwilling to swell these extensive notes by an enlarged description of so unsuccessful a work the Author has prophesied in the close of it that although neglected by his own age it would be esteemed by futuritya singular proof that even the most favoured writers are frequently disposed to declaim against the period in which they live If Lope de Vega could think himself neglected what Poet may ever expect to be satisfied with popular applauseBut to return to his Jerusalem Conquistada Richard the Second of England and Alphonso the Eighth of Castile are the chief heroes of the poem which contains twenty cantos and closes with the unfortunate return of these confederate Kings and the death of Saladin It was first printed more than twenty years after the first appearance of Tasso's JerusalemOne of the most amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals In his Laurel de Apollo he celebrates  all the eminent Spanish and Portugueze Poets he speaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warmest applause Among the most pleasing passages in this poem is a compliment which he pays to his father who was like the father of Tasso a Poet of considerable talents  Among the smaller pieces of Lope de Vega there are two particularly curious a descriptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva and a sonnet in honour of the Invincible Armada the latter may be considered as a complete model of Spanish bombast "Go forth and burn the world" says the Poet addressing himself to that mighty fleet "my sighs will furnish your fails with a neverfailing wind and my breast will supply your cannon with inexhaustible fire"Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spanish character of our Poet with which I shall close my imperfect account of him It is his friend and biographer Montalvan who in the opening of his life bestows on him the following titles El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio Portento del Orbe Gloria de la Nacion Lustre de la Patria Oracula de la Lengua Centro de la Fama Assumpio de la Invidia Cuydado de la Fortuna Fenix de los Siglos Principe de los Versos Orfeo de las Ciencias Apolo de las Musas Horacio de los Poetas Virgilio de los Epicos Homero de los Heroycos Pindaro de los Lyricos Sofocles de los Tragicos y Terencio de los Comicos Unico entre los Mayores Mayor entre los Grandes y Grande a todas Luzes y en todas Materias  NOTE X VERSE  The brave Ercilla sounds with potent breath  His Epic trumpet in the fields of death  Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally distinguished as a Hero and a Poet but this exalted character notwithstanding his double claim to our regard is almost totally unknown in our country and I shall therefore endeavour to give the English reader the best idea that I can both of his gallant life and of his singular poemHe was born in Madrid on the th of August the third son of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla who though descended from a noble family pursued the profession of the law and was so remarkable for his talents that he acquired the appellation of "The subtle Spaniard" The mother of our Poet was also noble and from her he inherited his  second title Zuniga Ercilla was the name of an ancient castle in Biscay which had been long in the possession of his paternal ancestors He lost his father while he was yet an infant a circumstance which had great influence on his future life for his mother was received after the decease of her husband into the household of the Empress Isabella the wife of Charles the Vth and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace He soon obtained an appointment there in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip to whose service he devoted himself with the most heroic enthusiasm though Philip was a master who little deserved so generous an attachment At the age of fourteen he attended that Prince in the splendid progress which he made at the desire of his Imperial father through the principal cities of the Netherlands and through parts of Italy and Germany This singular expedition is very circumstantially recorded in a folio volume by a Spanish historian named Juan Christoval Calvete de Estrella whose work affords a very curious and striking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and romantic age All the cities which were visited by the Prince contended with each other in magnificent festivity the brilliant series of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited though they answered not their design of conciliating the affection of the sullen Philip might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame In he returned with the Prince into Spain and continued there for three years at the end of which he attended his royal master to England on his marriage with Queen Mary which was celebrated at Winchester in the summer of At this period Ercilla first assumed the military character for his sovereign received advice during his residence at London that the martial natives of Aranco a district on the coast of Chile had revolted from the Spanish government and dispatched an experienced officer named Alderete who attended him in England to subdue the insurrection investing him with the command of the rebellious province Ercilla embarked with Alderete but that officer dying in his passage our Poet proceeded to Lima Don Hurtado de Mendoza who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru appointed his son Don Garcia to supply the place of Alderete and sent him with a considerable force to oppose the Arancanians Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize and  greatly distinguished himself in the obstinate contest which ensued The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal struggle and the many splendid feats of valour which this scene afforded led our author to the singular design of making the war in which he was himself engaged the subject of an Heroic poem which he entitled "La Araucana" from the name of the country As many of his own particular adventures may be found in the following summary of his work I shall not here enlarge on his military exploits but proceed to one of the most mortifying events of his life which he briefly mentions in the conclusion of his poem After passing with great honour through many and various perils he was on the point of suffering a disgraceful death from the rash orders of his young and inconsiderate Commander On his return from an expedition of adventure and discovery to the Spanish city of Imperial he was present at a scene of public festivity displayed there to celebrate the accession of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain at a kind of tournament there arose an idle dispute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pineda in the heat of which the two disputants drew their swords many of the spectators joined in the broil and a report arising that the quarrel was a mere pretence to conceal some mutinous design the hasty Don Garcia their General committed the two antagonists to prison and sentenced them both to be publicly beheaded Ercilla himself declares he was conducted to the scaffold before his precipitate judge discovered the iniquity of the sentence but his innocence appeared just time enough to save him and he seems to have been fully reinstated in the good opinion of Don Garcia as among the complimentary sonnets addressed to Ercilla there is one which bears the name of his General in which he styles him the Divine Alonzo and celebrates both his military and poetical genius But Ercilla seems to have been deeply wounded by this affront for quitting Chile he went to Callao the port of Lima and there embarked on an expedition against a Spanish rebel named Lope de Aguirre who having murdered his captain and usurped the chief power was perpetrating the most cruel enormities in the settlement of Venezuela But Ercilla learned on his arrival at Panama that this barbarous usurper was destroyed he therefore resolved as his health was much impaired by the hardships he had passed to return to Spain He arrived there in the twentyninth  ninth year of his age but soon left it and travelled as he himself informs us through France Italy Germany Silesia Moravia and Pannonia but the particulars of this expedition are unknown In the year he appeared again at Madrid and was married to Maria Bazan a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the course of his military poem He is said to have been afterwards gentleman of the bedchamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId a prince who had been educated at Madrid but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very indistinctly recorded and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known In the year he resided at Madrid in a state of retirement and poverty The time and circumstances of his death are uncertain it is proved that he was living in the year by the evidence of a Spanish writer named Mosquera who in a treatise of military discipline speaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan Marques de Santa Cruz in a poem which has never appeared and is supposed to have been left imperfect at his death Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits ware not entirely unrewarded It is said that in speaking to his sovereign Philip he was so overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him "Don Alonzo replied the King speak to me in writing"He did so and obtained his request The Spanish Historian Ovalle who has written an account of Chile in which he frequently supports his narration by the authority of Ercilla affirms that our Poet presented his work to Philip with his own hand and received a recompence from the King But in this circumstance I fear the Historian was mistaken as he supposes it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile and our Poet in a distinct portion of his work which was not published till many years after that period expressly declares in addressing himself to Philip that all his attempts to serve him had been utterly unrequited Ercilla left no legitimate family but had some natural children the most eminent of which was a daughter who was advantageously married to a nobleman of Portugal  In that elegant collection of Spanish Poets "  Parnaso Espan̄ol  " there is a pleasing little amorous poem written by Ercilla in his youth which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega who has bestowed a very generous encomium on our Poet in his "  Laurel de Apolo  " But the great  and singular work which has justly rendered Ercilla immortal is his Poem entitled Araucana which was published in three separate parts the first appeared in he added the second in the succeeding year and in he printed a complete edition of the whole It was applauded by the most eminent writers of Spain and Cervantes in speaking of Don Quixote's Library has ranked it among the choicest treasures of the Castilian Muse Voltaire who speaks of Ercilla with his usual spirit and inaccuracy has the merit of having made our Poet more generally known though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely slight for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin a mistake into which he never could have fallen had he read the Araucana Indeed the undistinguishing censure which he passes on the poem in general after commending one particular passage sufficiently proves him a perfect stranger to many subsequent parts of the work yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is just Ercilla is certainly unequal but with all his defects he appears to me one of the most extraordinary and engaging characters in the poetical world Perhaps I am a little partial to him from the accidental circumstance of having first read his poem with a departed friend whose opinions are very dear to me and who was particularly fond of this military Bard However this may be my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following extensive sketch of his Work it has swelled to a much larger size than I at first intended for I was continually tempted to extend it by the desire of not injuring the peculiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet If I have not utterly failed in that desire the English reader will be enabled to judge and to enjoy an author who considering his subject and its execution may be said to stand single and unparalleled in the host of Poets His beauties and his defects are of so obvious a nature that I shall not enlarge upon them but let it be remembered that his poem was composed amidst the toils and perils of the most fatiguing and hazardous service and that his verses were sometimes written on scraps of leather from the want of better materials His style is remarkably pure and perspicuous and notwithstanding the restraint of rhyme it has frequently all the ease the spirit and the volubility of Homer I wish not however to conceal his defects and I have therefore given a very fair account of the strange episode he introduces  concerning the history of Dido which has justly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire I must however observe as an apology for Ercilla that many Bards of his country have considered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixotism for having slandered the chastity of so spotless a heroine If my memory does not deceive me both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman  against our Poet on this occasion but let us recollect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric spirit and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties than can be found in Voltaire  Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical encomiums by the writers of his own country and as I believe the most elegant compliment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spanish lady I shall close this account of him with a translation of the Sonnet in which she celebrates both the Hero and the Poet  SONETO DE LA SEN̄ORA DON̄A LEONOR DE ICIZ SEN̄ORA DE LA BARONIA DE RAFALES A DON ALONSO DE ERCILLA  Mil bronces para estatuas ya forxados  Mil lauros de tus obras premio honroso  Te ofrece Espan̄a Ercilla generoso  Por tu pluma y tu lanza tan ganados  Hourese tu valor entre soldados  Invidie tu nobleza el valeroso  Y busque en tí el poeta mas famoso  Lima para sus versos ma  limados  Derrame por el mundo tus loores  La fama y eternice tu memoria  Porque jamás el tiempo la consuma  Gocen ya sin temor de que hay mayores  Tus hechos y tus libros de igual gloria  Pues la han ganado igual la espada y pluma  SONNET FROM THE LADY LEONORA DE ICIZ BARONESS OF RAFALES TO DON ALONZO DE ERCILLA  Marble that forms the Hero's mimic frame  And laurels that reward the Poet's strain  Accept Ercilla from thy grateful Spain  Thy sword and pen alike this tribute claim  Our Warriors honor thy heroic name  Thy birth is envy'd by Ambition's train  Thy verses teach the Bard of happiest vein  A finer polish and a nobler aim  May glory round the world thy merit spread  In Memory's volume may thy praises stand  In characters that time shall ne'er destroy  Thy songs and thy exploits without the dread  To be surpass'd by a superior hand  With equal right their equal fame enjoy  A SKETCH OF THE ARAUCANA  THE Poem of Ercilla opens with the following exposition of his subject  I Sing not love of ladies nor of sights  Devis'd for gentle dames by courteous knights  Nor feasts nor tourneys nor that tender care  Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair  But the bold deeds of Valor's fav'rite train  Those undegenerate sons of warlike Spain  Who made Arauco their stern laws embrace  And bent beneath their yoke her untam'd race  Of tribes distinguish'd in the field I sing  Of nations who disdain the name of King  Courage that danger only taught to grow  And challenge honour from a generous foe  And persevering toils of purest fame  And feats that aggrandize the Spanish name  For the brave actions of the vanquish'd spread  The brightest glory round the victor's head  He then addresses his work to his sovereign Philip the Second and devotes his first Canto to the description of that part of the new world which forms the scene of his action and is called Arauco a district in the province of Chile He paints the singular character and various customs of its warlike inhabitants with great clearness and spirit In many points they bear a striking resemblance to the ancient Germans as they are drawn with a kind of poetical energy by the strong pencil of Tacitus The first Canto closes with a brief account how this martial province was subdued by a Spanish officer named Valdivia with an  intimation that his negligence in his new dominion gave birth to those important exploits which the Poet proposes to celebrate  CANTO II  ERCILLA begins his Cantos much in the manner of Ariosto with a moral reflection sometimes rather too much dilated but generally expressed in easy elegant and spirited verseThe following lines faintly imitate the two first stanzas of his second Canto  Many there are who in this mortal strife  Have reach'd the slippery heights of splendid life  For Fortune's ready hand its succour lent  Smiling she rais'd them up the steep ascent  To hurl them headlong from that lofty seat  To which she led their unsuspecting feet  E'en at the moment when all fears disperse  And their proud fancy sees no sad reverse  Little they think beguil'd by fair success  That Joy is but the herald of Distress  The hasty wing of time escapes their sight  And those dark evils that attend his flight  Vainly they dream with gay presumption warm  Fortune for them will take a steadier form  She unconcern'd at what her victims feel  Turns with her wonted haste her fatal wheel  After blaming his countrymen for abusing their good fortune the Poet celebrates in the following spirited manner the eagerness and indignation with which the Indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their Spanish oppressors  The Indians first by novelty dismay'd  As Gods rever'd us and as Gods obey'd  But when they found we were of woman born  Their homage turn'd to enmity and scorn  Their childish error when our weakness show'd  They blush'd at what their ignorance bestow'd  Fiercely they burnt with anger and with shame  To see their masters but of mortal frame  Disdaining cold and cowardly delay  They seek atonement on no distant day  Prompt and resolv'd in quick debate they join  To form of deep revenge their dire design  Impatient that their bold decree should spread  And shake the world around with sudden dread  Th' assembling Chieftains led so large a train  Their ready host o'erspread th' extensive plain  No summons now the soldier's heart requires  The thirst of battle every breast inspires  No pay no promise of reward they ask  Keen to accomplish their spontaneous task  And by the force of one avenging blow  Crush and annihilate their foreign foe  Of some brave Chiefs who to this council came  Well may'st thou Memory preserve the name  Tho' rude and savage yet of noble soul  Justly they claim their place on Glory's roll  Who robbing Spain of many a gallant son  In so confin'd a space such victories won  Whose fame some living Spaniards yet may spread  Too well attested by our warlike dead  The Poet proceeds to mention in the manner of Homer but in a much shorter catalogue the principal chieftains and the number of their respective vassals  Uncouthly as their names must sound to an English ear it seems necessary to run through the list as these free and nobleminded savages act so distinguished a part in the course of the poemTucapel stands first renowned for the most inveterate enmity to the Christians and leader of three thousand vassals Angol a valiant youth attended by four thousand Cayocupil with three and Millarapue an elder chief  with five thousand Paycabi with three thousand and Lemolemo with six Maregnano Gualèmo and Lebopia with three thousand each Elicura distinguished by strength of body and detestation of servitude with six thousand and the ancient Colocolo with a superior number Ongolmo with four thousand and Puren with six the fierce and gigantic Lincoza with a still larger train Peteguelen lord of the valley of Arauco prevented from personal attendance by the Christians dispatches six thousand of his retainers to the assembly the most distinguished of his party are Thomè and Andalican The Lord of the maritime province of Pilmayquen the bold Caupolican is also unable to appear at the opening of the council Many other Chieftains attended whose names the Poet suppresses lest his prolixity should offend As they begin their business in the style of the ancient Germans with a plentiful banquet they soon grow exasperated with liquor and a violent quarrel ensues concerning the command of the forces for the projected war an honour which almost every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for himself In the midst of this turbulent debate the ancient Colocolo delivers the following harangue which Voltaire prefers and I think with great justice to the speech of Nestor on a similar occasion in the first Iliad  Assembled Chiefs ye guardians of the land  Think not I mourn from thirst of lost command  To find your rival spirits thus pursue  A post of honour which I deem my due  These marks of age you see such thoughts disown  In me departing for the world unknown  But my warm love which ye have long possest  Now prompts that counsel which you'll find the best  Why should we now for marks of glory jar  Why wish to spread our martial name afar  Crush'd as we are by Fortune's cruel stroke  And bent beneath an ignominious yoke  Ill can our minds such noble pride maintain  While the fierce Spaniard holds our galling chain  Your generous fury here ye vainly shew  Ah rather pour it on th' embattled foe  What frenzy has your souls of sense bereav'd  Ye rush to selfperdition unperceiv'd  'Gainst your own vitals would ye lift those hands  Whose vigor ought to burst oppression's bands  If a desire of death this rage create  O die not yet in this disgraceful state  Turn your keen arms and this indignant flame  Against the breast of those who sink your fame  Who made the world a witness of your shame  Haste ye to cast these hated bonds away  In this the vigor of your souls display  Nor blindly lavish from your country's veins  Blood that may yet redeem her from her chains  E'en while I thus lament I still admire  The fervor of your souls they give me fire  But justly trembling at their fatal bent  I dread some dire calamitous event  Lest in your rage Dissention's frantic hand  Should cut the sinews of our native land  If such its doom my thread of being burst  And let your old compeer expire the first  Shall this shrunk frame thus bow'd by age's weight  Live the weak witness of a nation's fate  No let some friendly sword with kind relief  Forbid its sinking in that scene of grief  Happy whose eyes in timely darkness close  Sav'd from that worst of sights his country's woes  Yet while I can I make your weal my care  And for the public good my thoughts declare  Equal ye are in courage and in worth  Heaven has assign'd to all an equal birth  In wealth in power and majesty of soul  Each Chief seems worthy of the world's controul  These gracious gifts not gratefully beheld  To this dire strife your daring minds impell'd  But on your generous valor I depend  That all our country's woes will swiftly end  A Leader still our present state demands  To guide to vengeance our impatient bands  Fit for this hardy task that Chief I deem  Who longest may sustain a massive beam  Your rank is equal let your force be try'd  And for the strongest let his strength decide  The Chieftains acquiesce in this proposal which as Voltaire justly observes is very natural in a nation of savages The beam is produced and of a size so enormous that the Poet declares himself afraid to specify its weight The first Chieftains who engage in the trial support it on their shoulders five and six hours each Tucapel fourteen and Lincoza more than double that number when the assembly considering his strength as almost supernatural is eager to bestow on him the title of General but in the moment he is exulting in this new honour Caupolican arrives without attendants His person and character are thus described by the Poet  Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew  The viewless orb was of the granate's hue  Nature who partly robb'd him of his sight  Repaid this failure by redoubled might  This noble youth was of the highest state  His actions honour'd and his words of weight  Prompt and resolv'd in every generous cause  A friend to Justice and her sternest laws  Fashion'd for sudden feats or toils of length  His limbs possess'd both suppleness and strength  Dauntless his mind determin'd and adroit  In every quick and hazardous exploit  This accomplished Chieftain is received with great joy by the assembly and having surpassed Lincoza by many degrees in the trial is invested with the supreme command He dispatches a small party to attack a neighbouring Spanish fort they execute his orders and make  a vigorous assault After a sharp conflict they are repulsed but in the moment of their retreat Caupolican arrives with his army to their support The Spaniards in despair evacuate the fort and make their escape in the night the news is brought to Valdivia the Spanish Commander in the city of Conceptionand with his resolution to punish the Barbarians the canto concludes  CANTO III  O CURELESS malady Oh fatal pest  Embrac'd with ardor and with pride carest  Thou common vice thou most contagious ill  Bane of the mind and frenzy of the will  Thou foe to private and to public health  Thou dropsy of the soul that thirsts for wealth  Insatiate Avarice'tis from thee we trace  The various misery of our mortal race  With this spirited and generous invective against that prevailing vice of his countrymen which sullied the lustre of their most brilliant exploits Ercilla opens his d canto He does not scruple to assert that the enmity of the Indians arose from the avaricious severity of their Spanish oppressors and he accuses Valdivia on this head though he gives him the praise of a brave and gallant officerThis Spaniard on the first intelligence of the Indian insurrection dispatched his scouts from the city where he commanded They do not return Pressed by the impatient gallantry of his troops Valdivia marches outthey soon discover the mangled heads of his messengers fixed up as a spectacle of terror on the road Valdivia deliberates what measures to pursue His army entreat him to continue his march He consents being piqued by their insinuations of his disgracing the Spanish arms An Indian ally brings him an account that twenty thousand of the confederated Indians are waiting to destroy him in the valley of Tucapel He still presses forward arrives  in sight of the fort which the Indians had destroyed and engages them in a most obstinate battle in the description of which the Poet introduces an original and striking simile in the following manner  The steady pikemen of the savage band  Waiting our hasty charge in order stand  But when th' advancing Spaniard aim'd his stroke  Their ranks to form a hollow square they broke  An easy passage to our troop they leave  And deep within their lines their foes receive  Their files resuming then the ground they gave  Bury the Christians in that closing grave  As the keen Crocodile who loves to lay  His silent ambush for his finny prey  Hearing the scaly tribe with sportive sound  Advance and call a muddy darkness round  Opens his mighty mouth with caution wide  And when th' unwary fish within it glide  Closing with eager haste his hollow jaw  Thus satiates with their lives his rav'nous maw  So in their toils without one warning thought  The murd'rous foe our little squadron caught  With quick destruction in a fatal strife  From whence no Christian soldier 'scap'd with life  Such was the fate of the advanced guard of the Spaniards The Poet then describes the conflict of the main army with great spiritten Spaniards distinguish themselves by signal acts of courage but are all cut in pieces The battle proceeds thus  The hostile sword now deeply dy'd in blood  Drench'd the wide field with many a sanguine flood  Courage still grows to form the fierce attack  But wasted vigor makes the combat slack  No pause they seek to gain exhausted breath  No rest except the final rest of death  The wariest combatants now only try  To snatch the sweets of vengeance ere they die  The fierce disdain of death and scorn of flight  Give to our scanty troop such wond'rous might  The Araucanian host begin to yield  They quit with loss and shame the longfought field  They fly and their pursuers shake the plain  With joyous shouts of Victory and Spain  But dire mischance and Fate's resistless sway  Gave a strange issue to the dreadful day  An Indian Youth a noble Chieftain's son  Who as our friend his martial feats begun  Our Leader's Page by him to battle train'd  Who now beside him the hard fight sustain'd  As he beheld his kindred Chiefs retire  Felt an indignant flash of patriot fire  And thus incited to a glorious stand  The flying champions of his native land  Misguided Country by vain fear possest  Ah whither dost thou turn thy timid breast  Ye brave compatriots shall your ancient fame  Be vilely buried in this field of shame  Those laws those rights ye gloried to defend  All perish all by this ignoble end  From Chiefs of dreaded power and honor'd worth  Ye sink to abject slaves the scorn of earth  To the pure founders of your boasted race  Ye give the cureless wound of deep disgrace  Behold the wasted vigor of your foe  See bath'd in sweat and blood their coursers blow  Lose not your mental force your martial fires  Our best inheritance from generous sires  Sink not the noble Araucanian name  From glory's summit to the depths of shame  Fly fly the servitude your souls detest  To the keen sword oppose the dauntless breast  Why shew ye frames endued with manly power  Yet shrink from danger in the trying hour  Fix in your minds the friendly truth I speak  Vain are your fears your terror blind and weak  Now make your names immortal now restore  Freedom's lost blessings to your native shore  Now turn while Fame and Victory invite  While prosp'rous Fortune calls you to the fight  Or yet a moment cease O cease to fly  And for our country learn of me to die  As thus he speaks his eager steps advance  And 'gainst the Spanish Chief he points his lance  To lead his kindred fugitives from flight  Singly he dares to tempt th' unequal fight  Against our circling arms that round him shine  Eager he darts amidst the thickest line  Keen as when chaf'd by summer's fiery beam  The young stag plunges in the cooling stream  The Poet proceeds to relate the great agility and valor displayed by Lantaro for such is the name of this gallant and patriotic Youth and as Ercilla has a soul sufficiently heroic to do full justice to the virtues of an enemy he gives him the highest praise Having mentioned on the occasion many heroes of ancient history he exclaims  Say of these famous Chiefs can one exceed  Or match this young Barbarian's noble deed  Vict'ry for them her purpose unexplor'd  Tempted by equal chance their happy sword  What risk what peril did they boldly meet  Save where Ambition urg'd the splendid feat  Or mightier Int'rest fir'd the daring mind  Which makes a Hero of the fearful Hind  Many there are who with a brave disdain  Face all the perils of the deathful plain  Who fir'd by hopes of glory nobly dare  Yet fail the stroke of adverse chance to bear  With animated fire their spirit shines  Till the short splendor of their day declines  But all their valor all their strength expires  When fickle Fortune from their side retires  This youthful Hero when the die was cast  War's dire decree against his country past  Made the stern Power the finish'd cause resume  And finally reverse the cruel doom  He by his efforts in the dread debate  Forc'd the determin'd will of adverse Fate  From shouting Triumph rush'd the palm to tear  And fix'd it on the brow of faint Despair  Caupolican leading his army back to the charge in consequence of Lantaro's efforts in their favour obtains a complete victory The Spaniards are all slain in the field except their Commander Valdivia who flies attended only by a priest but he is soon taken prisoner and conducted before the Indian Chief who is inclined to spare his life when an elder savage called Leocato in a sudden burst of indignation kills him with his club  All the people of Arauco assemble in a great plain to celebrate their victory old and young women and children unite in the festival and the trees that surround the scene of their assembly are decorated with the heads and spoils of their slaughtered enemies  They meditate the total extermination of the Spaniards from their country and even a descent on Spain The General makes a prudent speech to restrain their impetuosity and afterwards bestowing just applause on the brave exploit of the young Lantaro appoints him his lieutenant In the midst of the festivity Caupolican receives advice that a party of fourteen Spanish horsemen had attacked some of his forces with great havoc He dispatches Lantaro to oppose them  CANTO IV  A PARTY of fourteen gallant Spaniards who had set forth from the city of Imperial to join Valdivia not being apprized of his unhappy fate are surprized by the enemy where they expected to meet their Commanderthey defend themselves with great valor They are informed by a friendly Indian of the fate of Valdivia They attempt to retreat but are surrounded by numbers of the Araucanianswhen the Poet introduces the following instance of Spanish heroism which I insert as a curious stroke of their military character  Here cried a Spaniard far unlike his race  Nor shall his abject name my verse debase  Marking his few associates march along  O that our band were but a hundred strong  The brave Gonsalo with disdain replied  Rather let two be sever'd from our side  Kind Heaven that Memory may our feats proclaim  And call our little troop The Twelve of Fame  They continue to fight with great bravery against superior numbers when Lantaro arrives with a fresh army against them Still undaunted they only resolve to sell their lives as dear as possible Seven of them are cut to piecesIn the midst of the slaughter a furious thunder and hail storm arises by which incident the surviving seven escape The tempest is described with the following original simile  Now in the turbid air a stormy cloud  Spreads its terrific shadow o'er the crowd  The gathering darkness hides the solar ray  And to th' affrighted earth denies the day  The rushing winds to which the forests yield  Rive the tall tree and desolate the field  In drops distinct and rare now falls the rain  And now with thickening fury beats the plain  As the bold master of the martial drum  Ere to the shock th' advancing armies come  In awful notes that shake the heaven's high arch  Intrepid strikes the slow and solemn march  But when the charging heroes yield their breath  Doubles the horrid harmony of death  So the dark tempest with encreasing sound  Pours the loud deluge on the echoing ground  The few Spaniards that escape take refuge in a neighbouring fort which they abandon the following day on hearing the fate of Valdivia Lantaro returns and receives new honors and new forces from his General to march against a Spanish army which departs from the city of Penco under the command of Villagran an experienced officer to revenge the death of Valdivia The departure of the troops from Penco is described and the distress of the womenVillagran marches with expedition towards the frontiers of Arauco He arrives at a dangerous pass and finds Lantaro with his army of Indians advantageously posted on the heights and waiting with great steadiness and discipline to give him battle  CANTO V  LANTARO with great difficulty restrains the eager Indians in their post on the rock He suffers a few to descend and skirmish on the lower ground where several distinguish themselves in single combat The Spaniards attempt in vain to dislodge the army of Lantaro by an attack of their cavalrythey afterwards fire on them from six pieces of cannon  The vext air feels the thunder of the fight  And smoke and flame involve the mountain's height  Earth seems to open as the flames aspire  And new volcano's spout destructive fire  Lantaro saw no hopes of life allow'd  Save by dispersing this terrific cloud  That pours its lightning with so dire a shock  Smiting his lessen'd host who strew the rock  And to the troop of Leucoton the brave  His quick command the skilful Leader gave  He bids them fiercely to the charge descend  And thus exhorts aloud each ardent friend  My faithful partners in bright victory's meed  Whom fortune summons to this noble deed  Behold the hour when your prevailing might  Shall prove that Justice guards us in the fight  Now firmly fix your lances in the rest  And rush to honor o'er each hostile breast  Through every bar your bloody passage force  Nor let a brother's fall impede your course  Be yon dread instruments of death your aim  Possest of these you gain eternal fame  The camp shall follow your triumphant trace  And own you leaders in the glorious chace  While these bold words their ardent zeal exalt  They rush impetuous to the rash assault  The Indians undismayed by a dreadful slaughter gain possession of the cannonVillagran makes a short but spirited harangue to his flying soldiers He is unable to rally them and chusing rather to die than to survive so ignominious a defeat rushes into the thickest of the enemywhen the Poet leaving his fate uncertain concludes the canto  CANTO VI  THE valiant mind is privileg'd to feel  Superior to each turn of Fortune's wheel  Chance has no power its value to debase  Or brand it with the mark of deep disgrace  So thought the noble Villagran our Chief  Who chose that death should end his present grief  And smooth the horrid path with thorns o'erspread  Which Destiny condemn'd his feet to tread  With the preceding encomium on the spirit of this unfortunate officer the Poet opens his th Canto Thirteen of the most faithful soldiers of Villagran perceiving their Leader fallen motionless under the fury of his enemies make a desperate effort to preserve himBeing placed again on his horse by these generous deliverers he recovers from the blow which had stunned him and by singular exertion with the assistance of his spirited little troop effects his escape and rejoins his main army whom he endeavours in vain to lead back against the triumphant Araucanians The pursuit becomes general and the Poet describes the horrid massacre committed by the Indians on all the unhappy fugitives that fell into their handsThe Spaniards in their flight are stopt by a narrow pass fortified and guarded by a party of Indians Villagran forces the rude entrenchment in person and conducts part of his army safe through the pass but many attempting other roads over the mountainous country are either lost among the precipices of the rocks or pursued and killed by the Indians  CANTO VII  THE remains of the Spanish army after infinite loss and fatigue at last reach the city of Concepcion  Their entrance in these walls let fancy paint  O'erwhelm'd with anguish and with labor faint  These gash'd with ghastly wounds those writh'd with pain  And some their human semblance scarce retain  They seem unhappy spirits 'scap'd from hell  Yet wanting voice their misery to tell  Their pangs to all their rolling eyes express  And silence most declares their deep distress  When weariness and shame at length allow'd  Their tongues to satisfy th' enquiring crowd  From the pale citizens amaz'd to hear  A tale surpassing e'en their wildest fear  One general sound of lamentation rose  That deeply solemniz'd a nation's woes  The neighbouring mansions to their grief reply  And every wall return'd the mournful cry  The inhabitants of Concepcion expecting every instant the triumphant Lantaro at their gates resolve to abandon their city A gallant veteran upbraids their cowardly design They disregard his reproaches and evacuate the placewhen the Poet introduces the following instance of female heroism  'Tis just that Fame a noble deed display  Which claims remembrance even to the day  When Memory's hand no more the pen shall use  But sink in darkness and her being lose  The lovely Mencia an accomplish'd Dame  A valiant spirit in a tender frame  Here firmly shew'd as this dread scene began  Courage now found not in the heart of man  The bed of sickness 'twas her chance to press  But when she heard the city's loud distress  Snatching such weapons as the time allow'd  She rush'd indignant midst the flying crowd  Now up the neighbouring hill they slowly wind  And bending oft their mournful eyes behind  Cast a sad look of every hope berest  On those rich plains the precious home they left  More poignant grief see generous Mencia feel  More noble proof she gives of patriot zeal  Waving a sword in her heroic hand  In their tame march she stopt the timid band  Cross'd the ascending road before their van  And turning to the city thus began  Thou valiant nation whose unequall'd toils  Have dearly purchas'd fame and golden spoils  Where is the courage ye so oft display'd  Against this foe from whom ye shrink dismay'd  Where those high hopes and that aspiring flame  Which made immortal praise your constant aim  Where your firm souls that every chance defied  And native strength that form'd your noble pride  Ah whither would you fly in selfish fear  In frantic haste with no pursuer near  How oft has censure to your hearts assign'd  Ardor too keenly brave and rashly blind  Eager to dart amid the doubtful fray  Scorning the useful aid of wise delay  Have we not seen you with contempt oppose  And bend beneath your yoke unnumber'd foes  Attempt and execute designs so bold  Ye grew immortal as ye heard them told  Turn to your people turn a pitying eye  To whom your fears these happy seats deny  Turn and survey this fair this fertile land  Whose ready tribute waits your lordly hand  Survey its pregnant mines its sands of gold  Survey the flock now wandering from its fold  Mark how it vainly seeks in wild despair  The faithless shepherd who forsakes his care  E'en the dumb creatures of domestic kind  Though not endow'd with man's discerning mind  Now shew the semblance of a reasoning soul  And in their masters misery condole  The stronger animals of sterner heart  Take it this public woe a feeling part  Their plaintive roar that speaks their sense aright  Justly upbraids your ignominious flight  Ye fly from quiet opulence and fame  Purchas'd by valor your acknowledg'd claim  From these ye fly to seek a foreign seat  Where dastard fugitives no welcome meet  How deep the shame an abject life to spend  In poor dependance on a pitying friend  Turn let the brave their only choice await  Or honourable life or instant fate  Return return O quit this path of shame  stain not by fear your yet unsullied name  Myself I offer if our foes advance  To rush the foremost on the hostile lance  My actions then shall with my words agree  And what a woman dares your eyes shall see  Return return she cried but cried in vain  Her fire seem'd frenzy to the coward train  The dastardly inhabitants of the city unmoved by this remonstrance of the noble Donna Mencia de Nidos continue their precipitate flight and after twelve days of confusion and fatigue reach the city of Santiago in the valley of Mapocho Lantaro arrives in the mean time before the walls they had desertedand the Poet concludes his canto with a spirited description of the barbaric fury with which the Indians entered the abandoned city and destroyed by fire the rich and magnificent mansions of their Spanish oppressors  CANTO VIII  LANTARO is recalled from his victorious exploits to assist at a general assembly of the Indians in the valley of Arauco The different Chieftains deliver their various sentiments concerning the war after their Leader Caupolican has declared his design to pursue the Spaniards with unceasing vengeance The veteran Colocolo proposes a plan for their military operations An ancient Augur named Puchecalco denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon He recites the omens of their destruction The fierce Tucapel provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet strikes him dead in the midst of his harangue by a sudden blow of his mace Caupolican orders the murderous Chieftain to be led to instant death He defends himself with success against numbers who attempt to seize him Lantaro pleased by this exertion of his wonderful force and valour intreats the General to forgive what had passed and at his intercession Tucapel is received into favour Lantaro then closes the business of the assembly by recommending the plan proposed by Colocolo and intreating that he may himself be entrusted with a detached party of five hundred Indians with which he engages to reduce the city of Santiago His proposal is accepted The Chieftains having finished their debate declare their resolutions to their people and after their usual festivity Caupolican with the main army proceeds to attack the city of Imperial  CANTO IX  THE Poet opens this Canto with an apology for a miracle which he thinks it necessary to relate as it was attested by the whole Indian army and though it does not afford him any very uncommon or sublime  imagery he embellishes the wonder he describes by his easy and spirited versification of which the following lines are an imperfect copy  When to the city's weak defenceless wall  Its foes were rushing at their trumpet's call  The air grew troubled with portentous sound  And mournful omens multiplied around  With furious shock the elements engage  And all the winds contend in all their rage  From clashing clouds their mingled torrents gush  And rain and hail with rival fury rush  Bolts of loud thunder floods of lightning rend  The opening skies and into earth descend  O'er the vast army equal terrors spread  No mind escapes the universal dread  No breast tho' arm'd with adamantine power  Holds its firm vigor in this horrid hour  For now the fierce Eponamon appears  And in a Dragon's form augments their fears  Involving flames around the Daemon swell  Who speaks his mandate in a hideous yell  He bids his votaries with haste invest  The trembling city by despair deprest  Where'er th' invading squadrons force their way  He promises their arms an easy prey  Spare not he cry'd in the relentless strife  One Spanish battlement one Christian life  He spoke and while the host his will adore  Melts into vapour and is seen no more  Quick as he vanish'd Nature's struggles cease  The troubled elements are sooth'd to peace  The winds no longer rage with boundless ire  But hush'd insilence to their caves retire  The clouds disperse restoring as they fly  The unobstructed sun and azure sky  Fear only held its place and still possest  Usurp'd dominion o'er the boldest breast  The tempest ceas'd and heaven serenely bright  Arrayed the moisten'd earth in joyous light  When pois'd upon a cloud that swiftly flew  A Female form descended to their view  Clad in the radiance of so rich a veil  As made the sun's meridian lustre pale  For it outshone his golden orb as far  As his full blaze outshines the twinkling star  Her sacred features banish all their dread  And o'er the host reviving comfort shed  An hoary Elder by her side appear'd  For age and sanctity of life rever'd  And thus she spoke with soft persuasive grace  Ah whither rush ye blind devoted race  Turn while you can towards your native plain  Nor 'gainst yon city point your arms in vain  For God will guard his faithful Christian band  And give them empire o'er your bleeding land  Since thankless false and obstinate in ill  You scorn submission to his sacred will  Yet shun those walls th' Almighty there ador'd  There arms his people with Destruction's sword  So spoke the Vision with an angel's tongue  And thro' the spacious air to heaven she sprung  The Indians confounded by this miraculous interposition disperse in disorder to their several homes and the Poet proceeds very gravely to affirm that having obtained the best information from many individuals concerning this miracle that he might be very exact in his account of it he finds it happened on the twentythird of April four years before he wrote the verses that describe it and in the year of our Lord The Vision was followed by pestilence and famine among the Indians They remain inactive during the winter but assemble again the ensuing spring in the plains of Arauco to renew the war  They receive intelligence that the Spaniards are attempting to rebuild the city of Concepcion and are requested by the neighbouring tribes to march to their assistance and prevent that design Lantaro leads a chosen band on that expedition hoping to surprize the fort the Spaniards had erected on the ruins of their city but the Spanish commander Alvarado being apprized of their motion sallies forth to meet the Indian party a skirmish ensues the Spaniards retire to their fort Lantaro attempts to storm it a most bloody encounter ensues Tucapel signalizes himself in the attack the Indians persevere with the most obstinate valour and after a long conflict described with a considerable portion of Homeric spirit gain possession of the fort Alvarado and a few of his followers escape they are pursued and much galled in their flight a single Indian named Rengo harrasses Alvarado and two of his attendants the Spanish officer provoked by the insult turns with his two companions to punish their pursuer but the wily Indian secures himself on some rocky heights and annoys them with his sling till despairing of revenge they continue their flight  CANTO X  THE Indians celebrate their victory with public games and prizes are appointed for such as excel in their various martial exercises Leucoton is declared victor in the contest of throwing the lance and receives a scimitar as his reward Rengo subdues his two rivals Cayeguan and Talco in the exercise of wrestling and proceeds to contend with Leucoton After a long and severe struggle Rengo has the misfortune to fall by an accidental failure of the ground but springing lightly up engages his adversary with increasing fury and the canto ends without deciding the contest  CANTO XI  LANTARO separates the two enraged antagonists to prevent the ill effects of their wrath The youth Orompello whom Leucoton had before surpassed in the contest of the lance challenges his successful rival to wrestle they engage and fall together the victory is disputed Tucapel demands the prize for his young friend Orompello and insults the General Caupolican The latter is restrained from avenging the insult by the sage advice of the veteran Colocolo at whose request he distributes prizes of equal value to each of the claimants To prevent farther animosities they relinquish the rest of the appointed games and enter into debate on the war Lantaro is again appointed to the command of a chosen troop and marches towards the city of St Jago The Spaniards alarmed at the report of his approach send out some forces to reconnoitre his party a skirmish ensues they are driven back to the city and relate that Lantaro is fortifying a strong post at some distance intending soon to attack the city Villagran the Spaniard who commanded there being confined by illness appoints an officer of his own name to sally forth with all the forces he can raise in quest of the enemy The Spaniards fix their camp on the approach of night near the fort of Lantaro they are suddenly alarmed and summoned to arms but the alarm is occasioned only by a single horse without a rider which Lantaro aware of their approach had turned loose towards their camp as an insulting mode of proclaiming his late victory in which he had taken ten of the Spanish horses  The Spaniards pass the night under arms resolving to attack the Indians at break of day Lantaro had issued orders that no Indian should sally from the fort under pain of death to prevent the advantage which the Spanish cavalry must have over his small forces in the open plain He also commanded his soldiers to retreat with an appearance of dismay at the first attack on the fort and suffer a considerable number of the enemy to enter the place This stratagem succeeds the Spaniards rush forward with great fury the Indians give ground but  soon turning with redoubled violence on those who had passed their lines destroy many and oblige the rest to save themselves by a precipitate flight The Indians forgetting the orders of their Leader in the ardour of vengeance sally forth in pursuit of their flying enemy Lantaro recalls them by the sound of a military horn which he blows with the utmost violence They return but dare not appear in the presence of their offended Commander He issues new restrictions and then summoning his soldiers together addresses them in a spirited yet calm and affectionate harangue on the necessity of martial obedience While he is yet speaking the Spaniards return to the attack but are again repulsed with great loss They retreat and encamp at the foot of a mountain unmolested by any pursuers  CANTO XII  THE Spaniards remain in their camp while two of their adventurous soldiers engage to return once more to the fort and examine the state of it On their approach one of them called Marcos Vaez is saluted by his name and promised security by a voice from within the walls Lantaro had formerly lived with him on terms of friendship and now invites him into the fort The Indian Chief harangues on the resolution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spaniards unless they submit He proposes however terms of accommodation to his old friend Marcos and specifies the tribute he should expect The Spaniard answers with disdain that the only tribute the Indians would receive from his countrymen would be torture and death Lantaro replies with great temper that arms and the valour of the respective nations must determine this point and proceeds to entertain his guest with a display of six Indians whom he had mounted and trained to exercise on Spanish horses The Spaniard challenges the whole party Lantaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict but dismisses him in peace He recalls him before he had proceeded far from the fort and telling him that his soldiers were much distressed by the want of provision entreats him to send a supply affirming it to be true  heroism to relieve an enemy from the necessities of famine The Spaniard subscribes to the sentiment and engages if possible to comply with the request Returning to his camp he acquaints his Commander Villagran with all that had passed who suspecting some dangerous design from Lantaro decamps hastily in the night to regain the city The Indian Chief is severely mortified by their departure as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat by letting large currents of water into the marshy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped Despairing of being able to succeed against their city now prepared to resist him he returns towards Arauco most sorely galled by his disappointment and thus venting his anguish  What can redeem Lantaro's wounded name  What plea preserve his failing arms from shame  Did not my ardent soul this task demand  Which now upbraids my unperforming hand  On me on me alone can censure fall  Myself th' adviser and the guide of all  Am I the Chief who in Fame's bright career  Ask'd to subdue the globe a single year  While at the head of this my glittering train  I weakly threaten Spanish walls in vain  Thrice has pale Cynthia with replenish'd ray  Seen my illorder'd troop in loose array  And the rich chariot of the blazing sun  Has from the Scorpion to Aquarius run  At last as fugitives these paths we tread  And mourn twice fifty brave companions dead  Could Fate's kind hand this hateful stain efface  Could death redeem me from this worse disgrace  My useless spear should pierce this abject heart  Which has so ill sustain'd a soldier's part  Unworthy thought the mean ignoble blow  Would only tempt my proud and vaunting foe  To boast that I preferr'd in fear's alarm  My own weak weapon to his stronger arm  By Hell I swear who rules the sanguine strife  If Chance allow me yet a year of life  I'll chase these foreign lords from Chile's strand  And Spanish blood shall saturate our land  No changing season neither cold nor heat  Shall make the firmer step of War retreat  Nor Shall the earth nor hell's expanding cave  From this avenging arm one Spaniard save  Now the brave Chief with solemn ardor swore  To his dear native home to turn no more  From no fierce sun no stormy winds to fly  But patiently abide the varying sky  And spurn all thoughts of pleasure and of ease  Till rescu'd fame his tortur'd soul appease  Till earth confess the brave Lantaro's hand  Has clos'd the glorious work his spirit plann'd  In these resolves the Hero found relief  And thus relax'd the o'erstrain'd cord of grief  Whose pressure gall'd him with such mental pain  That frenzy almost seiz'd his burning brain  Lantaro continues his march into an Indian district from which he collects a small increase of force and after addressing his soldiers concerning the expediency of strict military discipline and the cause of their late ill success he turns again towards the city of St Jago but receiving intelligence on his road of its preparations for defence he again suspends his design and fortifies a post which he chuses with the hope of collecting still greater numbers to assist him in his projected enterprize The Spaniards at St Jago are eager to sally in quest of Lantaro but their Commander Villagran was absent on an expedition to the city of Imperial In returning from thence he passes near the post of Lantaro An Indian ally acquaints him with its situation and at the earnest request of the Spanish officer agrees to conduct him by a short though difficult road over a mountain to attack the fort by surprize The Poet suspends his narration of this interesting event to relate the arrival of new forces from Spain in America and he now begins  to appear himself on the field of action "Hitherto" says he "I have described the scenes in which I was not present yet I have collected my information from no partial witnesses and I have recorded only those events in which both parties agree Since it is known that I have shed so much blood in support of what I affirm my future narration will be more authentic for I now speak as an ocular witness of every action unblinded by partiality which I disdain and resolved to rob no one of the praise which he deserves"  After pleading his youth as an apology for the defects of his style and after declaring that his only motive for writing was the ardent desire to preserve so many valiant actions from perishing in oblivion the Poet proceeds to relate the arrival of the Marquis de Canete as Viceroy in Peru and the spirited manner in which he corrected the abuses of that country The canto concludes with reflections on the advantages of loyalty and the miseries of rebellion  CANTO XIII  SPANISH deputies from the province of Chile implore assistance from the new Viceroy of Peru he sends them a considerable succour under the conduct of Don Garcia his son The Poet is himself of this band and relates the splendid preparations for the enterprize and the embarkation of the troops in ten vessels which sail from Lima towards the coast of Chile Having described part of this voyage he returns to the bold exploit of Villagran and the adventures of Lantaro the most interesting of all the Araucanian Heroes whom he left securing himself in his sequestered fort  A path where watchful centinels were spread  A single path to this lone station led  No other signs of human step were trac'd  For the vex'd land was desolate and waste  It chanc'd that night the noble Chieftain prest  His anxious mistress to his gallant breast  The fair Guacolda for whose charms he burn'd  And whose warm heart his faithful love return'd  That night beheld the warlike savage rest  Free from th' incumbrance of his martial vest  That night alone allow'd his eyes to close  In the deceitful calm of short repose  Sleep prest upon him like the weight of death  But soon he starts alarm'd and gasps for breath  The fair Guacolda with a trembling tongue  Anxious enquires from whence his anguish sprung  My lovely Fair the brave Lantaro cries  An hideous vision struck my scornful eyes  Methought that instant a fierce Chief of Spain  Mock'd my vain spear with insolent disdain  His forceful arm my failing powers o'ercame  And strength and motion seem'd to quit my frame  But still the vigor of my soul I keep  And its keen anger burst the bonds of sleep  With quick despair the troubled Fair one said  Alas thy dreams confirm the ills I dread  'Tis comethe object of my boding fears  Thy end the source of my unceasing tears  Yet not so wretched is this mournful hour  Nor o'er me Fortune canst thou boast such power  But that kind death may shorten all my woes  And give the agonizing scene to close  Let my stern fate its cruel rage employ  And hurl me from the throne of love and joy  Whatever pangs its malice may devise  It cannot rend affection's stronger ties  Tho' horrible the blow my fears foresee  A second blow will set my spirit free  For cold on earth thy frame shall ne'er be found  While mine with useless being loads the ground  The Chief transported with her tender charms  Closely around her neck entwin'd his arms  And while fond tears her snowy breast bedew'd  Thus with redoubled love his speech pursu'd  My generous Fair thy gloomy thoughts dismiss  Nor let dark omens interrupt our bliss  And cloud these moments that with transport shine  While my exulting heart thus feels thee mine  Thy troubled fancy prompts my mutual sigh  Not that I think the hour of danger nigh  But Love so melts me with his soft controul  Impossibilities alarm my soul  If thy kind wishes bid Lantaro live  Who to this frame the wound of death can give  Tho' 'gainst me all the powers of earth combine  My life is subject to no hand but thine  Who has restor'd the Araucanian name  And rais'd it sinking in the depths of shame  When alien lords our nation's spirit broke  And bent its neck beneath a servile yoke  I am the Chief who burst our galling chain  And freed my country from oppressive Spain  My name alone without my sword's display  Humbles our foes and fills them with dismay  These happy arms while thy dear beauties fill  I feel no terror I foresee no ill  Be not by false and empty dreams deprest  Since truth has nothing to afflict thy breast  Oft have I 'scap'd inur'd to every state  From many a darker precipice of fate  Oft in far mightier perils risk'd my life  And issued glorious from the doubtful strife  With less'ning confidence and deeper grief  Trembling she hung upon the soothing Chief  His lip with supplicating softness prest  And urg'd with many a tear this fond request  If the pure love which prodigal and free  When freedom most was mine I gave to thee  If truth which Heaven will witness and defend  Weigh with my sovereign lord and gentle friend  By these let me adjure thee by the pain  Which at our parting pierc'd my every vein  And all the vows if undispers'd in air  Which then with many a tear I heard thee swear  To this my only wish at least agree  If all thy wishes have been laws to me  Haste I entreat thee arm thyself with care  And bid thy soldiers for defence prepare  The brave Barbarian quick reply'd'Tis clear  How low my powers are rated by thy fear  Canst thou so poorly of Lantaro deem  And is this arm so sunk in thy esteem  This arm which rescuing thy native earth  So prodigally prov'd its valiant worth  In my try'd courage how complete thy trust  Whose terror weeps thy living lord as dust  In thee she cries with confidence most pure  My soul is satisfy'd yet not secure  What will thy arm avail in danger's course  If my malignant fate has mightier force  But let the mis'ry I forebode arise  On this firm thought My constant love relies  The sword whose stroke our union may disjoin  Will teach my faithful soul to follow thine  Since my hard destiny with rage severe  Thus threatens me with all that love can fear  Since I am doom'd the worst of ills to see  And lose all earthly good in losing thee  O suffer me to pass ere death appears  The little remnant of my life in tears  The heart that sinks not in distress like this  Could never feel could never merit bliss  Here from her eyes such floods of sorrow flow  Compassion weeps in gazing on her woe  The fond Lantaro tho' of firmest power  Sheds as she speaks a sympathetic shower  But to the tender scenes of love unus'd  My artless pen embarrass'd and confus'd  From its sad talk with diffidence withdraws  And in its labour asks a little pause  CANTO XIV  WHAT erring wretch to Truth and Beauty blind  Shall dare to satirize the Female kind  Since pure affection prompts their anxious care  Their lovely weakness and their fond despair  This fair Barbarian free from Christian ties  A noble proof of perfect love supplies  By kindest words and floods of tears that roll  From the clear source of her impassion'd soul  The chearing ardor of the dauntless Chief  Fails to afford her troubled mind relief  Nor can the ample trench and guarded wall  Preserve her doubtful heart from fear's enthrall  Her terrors rushing with love's mighty force  Level whatever would impede their course  She finds no shelter from her cruel doom  Save the dear refuge of Lantaro's tomb  Thus their two hearts where equal passion reign'd  A fond debate with tender strife maintain'd  Their differing words alike their love display  Feed the sweet poison and augment its sway  The sleepy soldiers now their stories close  And stretch'd around their sinking fires repose  The path in front with centinels was lin'd  And the high mountain was their guard behind  But o'er that mountain with advent'rous tread  Bold Villagran his silent forces led  His hasty march with painful toil he made  Toil is the price that must for fame be paid  Now near the fort and halting in its sight  He waits the coming aid of clearer light  The stars yet shining but their fires decay  And now the reddening east proclaims the day  Th' advancing troop no Indian eye alarms  For friendly darkness hover'd o'er their arms  And on the quarter where the Mountain rose  The careless guard despis'd the thought of foes  No panting horse their still approach betray'd  Propitious Fortune lent the Spaniards aid  Fortune who oft bids drowsy Sloth beware  And lulls to sleep the watchful eye of Care  When Night's obscure dominion first declines  And glimmering light the dusky air refines  The weary guards who round the wall were plac'd  Hail the new day and from their station haste  Secure of ill no longer watch they keep  Quick to forget their nightly toils in sleep  Thro' all the fort there reign'd a calm profound  In wine and slumber all its force was drown'd  The Spanish Chief who saw the fav'ring hour  Led on by slow degrees his silent power  No Indian eyes perceiv'd his near advance  Fate seem'd to bind them in a cruel trance  Each in sound slumber draws his easy breath  Nor feels his slumber will be clos'd by Death  So blind are mortals to that tyrant's sway  They deem him distant while they sink his prey  Our eager soldiers now no longer halt  While kind occasion prompts the keen assault  A shout they raise terrific loud and long  Swell'd by the voice of all the ardent throng  Whose ranks obedient to their Leader's call  Rush with light ardor'o er th' unguarded wall  And gain the fort where Sleep's oppressive weight  Expos'd his wretched victims blind to fate  As villains conscious of their life impure  Find in their guilty course no spot secure  For vice is ever doom'd new fears to feel  And tremble at each turn of Fortune's wheel  At every noise at each alarm that stirs  Death's penal horror to their mind occurs  Quick to their arms they fly with wild dismay  And rush where hasty terror points the way  So quick the Indians to the tumult came  With sleep and valour struggling in their frame  Unaw'd by danger's unexpected sight  They rouse their fellows and they rush to fight  Tho' their brave bosoms are of armour bare  Their manly hearts their martial rage declare  No furious odds their gallant souls appall  But resolute they fly to guard the wall  It was the season when with tender care  Lantaro reason'd with his anxious Fair  Carest consol'd and in his anger kind  Mildly reprov'd her weak mistrusting mind  Spite of his chearing voice she trembles still  Severer terrors now her bosom fill  For sterner sounds their soft debate o'ercome  Drown'd in the rattle of th' alarming drum  But not so quick on Apprehension's wings  The wretched miser from his pillow springs  Whose hoarded gold forbids his mind to rest  If doubtful noise the nightly thief suggest  Nor yet so hasty tho' with terror wild  Flies the fond mother to her wounded child  Whose painful cry her shuddering soul alarms  As flew Lantaro at the sound of arms  His mantle rapidly around him roll'd  And grasping a light sword with hasty hold  Too eager for his heavier arms to wait  The fierce Barbarian hurried to the gate  O faithless Fortune thou deceitful friend  Of thy false favours how severe the end  How quick thou cancell'st when thy frown appears  Th' accumulated gifts of long triumphant years  To aid the Spaniards in their bold emprize  Four hundred Indians march'd their firm allies  Who on the left their line of battle close  And haste to combat with their painted bows  Launching adroitly in their rapid course  Unnumber'd arrows with unerring force  As brave Lantaro issued from his tent  A shaft to meet the sallying Chief was sent  Thro' his left side ye valiant mourn his lot  Flew the keen arrow with such fury shot  It pierc'd his heart the bravest and the best  That e'er was lodg'd within a human breast  Proud of the stroke that laid such valor low  Death seem'd to glory in th' important blow  And that no Mortal might his triumph claim  In darkness hid the doubtful Archer's name  Such force the keen resistless weapon found  It stretch'd the mighty Chieftain on the ground  And gave large outlet to his ardent blood  That gush'd apace in a tumultuous flood  From his sunk cheek its native colour fled  His sightless eyes roll'd in his ghastly head  His soul that felt its glorious hopes o'erthrown  Retir'd indignant to the world unknown  The noble savages not dismayed by the death of their Leader continue to defend the fort with great fury  CANTO XV  THE Poet opens this canto with a lively panegyric on Love he affirms that the greatest Poets have derived their glory from their vivid descriptions of this enchanting passion and he laments that he is precluded by his subject from indulging his imagination in such scenes as are more likely to captivate a reader  He seems to intend this as an apology but I must own it is an unsatisfactory one for deserting the fair Guacolda whom he mentions no more He proceeds to describe the sharp contest which the undaunted Indians still maintained in their fortthey refuse quarter which is offered them by the Spanish Leader and all resolutely perish with the brave and beloved Lantaro The Poet then resumes his account of the naval expedition from Peru to Chile and concludes the canto with a spirited description of a storm which attacked the vessels as they arrived in sight of the province to which they were steering  CANTO XVI  THE storm abates The Spaniards land and fortify themselves on an island near the country of the Araucanians The latter hold a council of war in the valley of Ongolmo Caupolican their General proposes to attack the Spaniards in their new post The elder Chieftains dissuade him from the design A quarrel ensues between Tucapel and the aged Peteguelenthey are appeased by a speech of the venerable Colocolo by whose advice a spirited and adroit young Indian named Millalanco is dispatched as a peaceful ambassador to learn the situation and designs of the Spaniards He embarks in a large galley with oars and soon arrives at the island He surveys the Spanish implements of war with astonishment and is conducted to the tent of the General Don Garcia  CANTO XVII  THE Indian addresses the Spanish officers with a proposal of peace and amity He is dismissed with presents The Chieftains on his return pretend to relinquish hostilities but prepare secretly for war The Spaniards remain unmolested on the island during the stormy season They send a select party of a hundred and thirty including our Poet to raise a fort on the continent these execute their commission with infinite dispatch and all the Spanish troops remove to this new post The Araucanians are alarmed An intrepid Youth named Gracolano proposes to the Indian General Caupolican to storm the fort The Indians advance near it under shelter of the night The Poet describes himself at this juncture as oppressed by the excessive labours of the day and unable to pursue his poetical studies according to his nightly custom the pen falls from his hand he is seized with violent pains and tremblings his strength and senses forsake him but soon recovering from this infirmity he enjoys a refreshing sleep Bellona appears to him in a vision and encourages him both as a soldier and a poet She conducts him through a delicious country to the summit of a most lofty mountain when pointing to a spot below she informs him it is St Quintin and that his countrymen under the command of their sovereign Philip are just marching to attack it she adds that her presence is necessary in the midst of that important scene and leaves the Poet on the eminence to survey and record the battle  CANTO XVIII  AFTER the Poet has described the success of his royal master at St Quintin a female figure of a most venerable appearance but without a name relates to him prophetically many future events of great importance to his country She touches on the disturbances in the  Netherlands the enterprizes of the Turks and the exploits of Don John of Austria at that time unknown to fame These she hints very imperfectly telling the Poet that if he wishes for farther information he must follow the steps of a tame deer which he will find in a particular spot this animal will lead him to the cell of an ancient hermit formerly a soldier who will conduct him to the secret cave of the unsocial Fiton a mighty magician who will display to him the most miraculous visions His female Instructor then advises him to mix softer subjects with the horrors of war and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many Beauties who then flourished in Spain He beholds all these lovely fair ones assembled in a delicious paradise and he is particularly attracted by a young lady whose name he discovers to be Donna Maria Bazan his future wife in the moment that he begins to question his Guide concerning this engaging Beauty he is roused from his vision by the sound of an alarm He snatches up his arms and hurries to his postwhile the morning dawns and the Indians begin to attack the fort  CANTO XIX  THE Indians advance in three squadrons The Youth Gracolano o'erleaps the trench supported on a lofty pike by which he also passes the wall He defends himself in the midst of the Spaniards with great spirit but finding himself unsupported he wrenches a lance from a Spanish soldier and tries to leap once more over the trench but he is struck by a stone while vaulting through the air and falls covered as the Poet expressly declares with twoandthirty wounds Some of his friends are shot near him but the Indians get possession of the Spanish lance with which he had sprung over the wall and brandish it in triumph The Spaniard named Elvira who had lost his weapon piqued by the adventure sallies from the fort and returns amid the shouts of his countrymen with an Indian spear which he won in single combat from a Barbarian whom he had perceived detached from his  party The Indians attempt to storm the fort on every side many are destroyed by the Spanish firearms The head of the ancient Peteguelen is shot off but Tucapel passes the wall and rushes with great slaughter into the midst of the enemy The Spaniards who were in the ships that anchored near the coast hasten on shore and march to assist their countrymen in the fort but are attacked by a party of Indians in their march The conflict continues furious on the walls but the Indians at length retreat leaving Tucapel still fighting within the fort  CANTO XX  TUCAPEL though severely wounded escapes with life and rejoins the Indian army which continues to retreat The Spaniards sally from the fort but soon return to it from the apprehension of an ambuscade They clear their trench and strengthen the weaker parts of their fortification Night comes on The Poet describes himself stationed on a little eminence in the plain below the fort which was seated on high and rocky groundfatigued with the toils of the day and oppressed by the weight of his armour which he continues to wear he is troubled with a lethargic heaviness which he counteracts by exercise declaring that his disposition to slumber in his post arose not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine as mouldy biscuit and rainwater had been for some time his chief sustenance and that he was accustomed to make the moist earth his bed and to divide his time between his poetical and his military labours He then relates the following nocturnal adventure which may perhaps be considered as the most striking and pathetic incident in this singular poem  While thus I strove my nightly watch to keep  And struggled with th' oppressive weight of sleep  As my quick feet with many a silent stride  Travers'd th' allotted ground from side to side  My eye perceiv'd one quarter of the plain  White with the mingled bodies of the slain  For our incessant fire that bloody day  Had slaughter'd numbers in the stubborn fray  As oft I paus'd each distant noise to hear  Gazing around me with attentive ear  I heard from time to time a feeble sound  Towards the breathless Indians on the ground  Still closing with a sigh of mournful length  At every interval it gather'd strength  And now it ceas'd and now again begun  And still from corse to corse it seem'd to run  As night's encreasing shade my hope destroys  To view the source of this uncertain noise  Eager my mind's unquiet doubts to still  And more the duties of my post fulfil  With crouching steps I haste and earnest eyes  To the low spot from whence the murmurs rise  And see a dusky Form that seems to tread  Slow on four feet among the gory dead  With terror that my heart will not deny  When this strange vision struck my doubtful eye  Towards it with a prayer to Heav'n I prest  Arms in my hand my corselet on my breast  But now the dusky Form on which I sprung  Upright arose and spoke with plaintive tongue  Mercy to mercy hear my just pretence  I am a woman guiltless of offence  If my distress and unexampled plight  No generous pity in thy breast excite  If thy bloodthirsty rage by tears uncheck'd  Would pass those limits which the brave respect  Will such a deed encrease thy martial fame  When Heaven's just voice shall to the world proclaim  That by thy ruthless sword a woman died  A widow sunk in sorrow's deepest tide  Yet I implore thee if 'twas haply thine  Or for thy curse as now I feel it mine  If e'er thy lot in any state to prove  How firm the faithful ties of tender love  O let me bury one brave warrior slain  Whose corse lies blended with this breathless train  Remember he who thwarts the duteous will  Becomes th' approver and the cause of ill  Thou wilt not hinder these my pious vows  War fiercest war this just demand allows  The basest tyranny alone is driven  To use the utmost power that chance has given  Let but my soul its dear companion find  Then sate thy fury if to blood inclin'd  For in such grief I draw my lingering breath  Life is my dread beyond the pangs of death  There is no ill that now can wound my breast  No good but what I in my Love possest  Fly then ye hours that keep me from the dead  For he the spirit of my life is fled  If adverse Heaven my latest wish deny  On his dear corse to fix my closing eye  My tortur'd soul in cruel Fate's despight  Will soar the faithful partner of his flight  And now her agony of heart implor'd  An end of all her sorrows from my sword  Doubt and distrust my troubled mind assail  That fears deceit in her affecting tale  Nor was I fully of her faith secure  Till oft her words the mournful truth insure  Suspicion whisper'd that an artful spy  By this illusion might our state descry  Howe'er inclin'd to doubt yet soon I knew  Though night conceal'd her features from my view  That truth was stamp'd on every word she said  So full of grief so free from guilty dread  And that bold love to every danger blind  Had sent her forth her slaughter'd Lord to find  Who in the onset of our bloody strife  For brave distinction sacrific'd his life  Fill'd with compassion when I saw her bent  To execute her chaste and fond intent  I led her weeping to the higher spot  To guard whose precincts was that night my lot  Securely there I begg'd her to relate  The perfect story of her various fate  From first to last her touching woes impart  And by the tale relieve her loaded heart  Ah she replied relief I ne'er can know  Till Death's kind aid shall terminate my woe  Earth for my ills no remedy supplies  Beyond all suff'rance my afflictions rise  Yet though the talk will agonize my soul  Of my sad story I will tell the whole  Grief thus inforc'd my life's weak thread may rend  And in the killing tale my pangs may end  The fair Indian then relates to Ercilla the particulars of her life in speech of considerable lengthshe informs him that her name is Tegualdathat she is the daughter of the Chieftain Brancólthat her father had often pressed her to marry which she had for some time declined though solicited by many of the noblest Youths in her country till being appointed in compliment to her beauty to distribute the prizes in a scene of public festivity to those who excelled in the manly exercises she was struck by the accomplishments of a gallant Youth named Crepino as she bestowed on him the reward of his victoriesthat she declared her choice to her father after perceiving the Youth inspired with a mutual affection for herthat the old Chieftain was delighted by her chusing so noble a character and their marriage had been publicly solemnized but a month from that day On this conclusion of her story she bursts into new agonies of grief and intreats Ercilla to let her pay her last duties to her husband or rather to unite them again in a common grave Ercilla endeavours to console her by repeated promises of all the assistance in his power In the most passionate excess of sorrow  she still entreats him to end her miserable lifeIn this distressing scene our Author is relieved by the arrival of a brother officer who had been also stationed on the plain and now informs Ercilla that the time of their appointed watch is expired They join in comforting the unhappy Mourner and conduct her into the fort where they consign her for the remainder of the night to  the decent care of married women  to use the chaste expression of the generous and compassionate Ercilla  CANTO XXI  IN pure affection who has soar'd above  The tender pious proof of faithful love  Which thus awak'd our sympathetic care  For this unhappy fond barbarian Fair  O that just Fame my humble voice would raise  To swell in loudest notes her lasting praise  To spread her merits in immortal rhyme  Through every language and through every clime  With pitying females she the night remain'd  Where no rude step their privacy profan'd  Though wretched thankful for their soothing aid  With hopes her duty would at length be paid  Soon as the welcome light of morning came  Though soundest sleep had seiz'd my jaded frame  Though my tir'd limbs were still to rest inclin'd  Solicitude awak'd my anxious mind  Quick to my Indian Mourner I repair  And still in tears I find the restless Fair  The varying hours afford her no relief  No transient momentary pause of grief  With truest pity I her pangs assuage  To find her slaughter'd Lord my word engage  Restore his corse and with a martial band  Escort her safely to her native land  With blended doubt and sorrow weeping still  My promis'd word she pray'd me to fulfil  Assembling now a menial Indian train  I led her to explore the bloody plain  Where heaps of mingled dead deform'd the ground  Near to the fort the breathless Chief we found  Claycold and stiff the gory earth he prest  A fatal ball had pass'd his manly breast  Wretched Tegualda who before her view'd  The pale disfigur'd form in blood imbru'd  Sprung forward and with instantaneous force  Frantic she darted on the precious corse  And press'd his lips where livid death appears  And bath'd his wounded bosom in her tears  And kiss'd the wound and the wild hope pursues  That her fond breath may yet new life infuse  Wretch that I am at length she madly cried  Why does my soul these agonies abide  Why do I linger in this mortal strife  Nor pay to Love his just demand my life  Why poor of spirit at a single blow  Do I not close this bitter scene of woe  Whence this delay will Heaven to me deny  The wretch's choice and privilege to die  While bent on death in this despair she gasp'd  Her furious hands her snowy neck inclasp'd  Failing her frantic wish they do not spare  Her mournful visage nor her flowing hair  Much as I strove to stop her mad intent  Her fatal purpose I could scarce prevent  So loath'd she life and with such fierce controul  The raging thirst of death inflam'd her soul  When by my prayers and soft persuasion's balm  Her pangs of sorrow grew a little calm  And her mild speech confirm'd my hope at last  That her delirious agony was past  My ready Indian train with duteous haste  On a firm bier the claycold body plac'd  And bore the Warrior in whose fate we griev'd  To where her vassals the dear charge receiv'd  But lest from ruthless War's outrageous sway  The mourning Fair might suffer on her way  O'er the near mountains to a safer land  I march'd to guard her with my warlike band  And there secure for the remaining road  Was clear and open to her own abode  She gratefully declin'd my farther care  And thank'd and bless'd me in a parting prayer  As I have been tempted to dwell much longer than I intended on some of the most pathetic incidents of this extraordinary poem I shall give a more concise summary of the remaining cantosOn Ercilla's return the Spaniards continue to strengthen their fort They receive intelligence from an Indian ally that the Barbarian army intend a fresh assault in the night They are relieved from this alarm by the arrival of a large reinforcement from the Spanish cities in Chileon which event Colocolo prevails on the Indians to suspend the attack Caupolican the Indian General reviews all his forces and the various Chieftains are well described The Spanish Commander Don Garcia being now determined to march into the hostile district of Amuco addresses soldiers in a spirited harangue requesting them to remember the pious cause for which they fight and to spare the life of every Indian who is disposed to submission They remove from their post and pass in boats over the broad river Biobio  CANTO XXII  THE Spaniards are attacked in their new quartersa surious battle enfues The Spaniards are forced to give ground but at last prevail The Indian Chief Rengo signalizes himself in the action defends himself in a marsh and retreats in good order with his forces  The Spaniards after the conflict seize an unhappy straggling Youth named Galvarino whom they punish as a rebel in the most barbarous manner by cutting off both his hands The valiant Youth defies their cruelty in the midst of this horrid scene and brandishing his bloody stumps departs from his oppressors with the most insulting menaces of revenge  CANTO XXIII  GALVARINO appears in the Assembly of the Indian Chieftains and excites them in a very animated speech to revenge the barbarity with which he has been treated He faints from loss of blood in the close of his harangue but is recovered by the care of his friends and restored to health The Indians exasperated by the sight of his wounds unanimously determine to prosecute the war The Spaniards advancing in Arauco send forth scouts to discover the disposition of the neighbouring tribes Ercilla engaging in this service perceives an old Indian in a sequestered spot apparently sinking under the infirmities of age but on his approach the ancient figure flies from him with astonishing rapidity He endeavours in vain though on horseback to overtake this aged fugitive who soon escapes from his sight He now discovers the tame Deer foretold in his vision and pursuing it is conducted through intricate paths to a retired cottage where a courteous old man receives him in a friendly manner Ercilla enquires after the Magician Fiton the old man undertakes to guide him to the secret mansion of that wonderful Necromancer to whom he declares himself related He adds that he himself was once a distinguished warrior but having the misfortune to sully his past glory without losing his life in a conflict with another Chieftain he had withdrawn himself from society and lived twenty years as a hermit He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magician whose residence and magical apparatus are described with great force of imagination Fiton appears from a secret portal and proves to be the aged figure who had escaped so swiftly from the sight of Ercilla At the request of  his relation the old Warrior he condescends to shew Ercilla the wonders of his art He leads him to a large lucid globe selfsuspended in the middle of an immense apartment He tells him it is the work of forty years study and contains an exact representation of the world with this singular power that it exhibits at his command any scene of futurity which he wishes to beholdthat knowing the heroic composition of Ercilla he will give him an opportunity to vary and embellish his poem by the description of a most important seafight which he will display to him most distinctly on that sphere He then invokes all the powers of the infernal world Ercilla fixes his eye on the globe and perceives the naval forces of Spain with those of the Pope and the Venetians prepared to engage the great armament of the Turks  CANTO XXIV  DESCRIBES circumstantially the naval battle of Lepanto and celebrates the Spanish admiral Don John of Austria Ercilla gazes with great delight on this glorious action and beholds the complete triumph of his countrymen when the Magician strikes the globe with his wand and turns the scene into darkness Ercilla after being entertained with other marvellous sights which he omits from his dread of prolixity takes leave of his two aged friends and regains his quarters The Spaniards continue to advance on their pitching their camp in a new spot towards evening an Araucanian fantastically drest in armour enquires for the tent of Don Garcia and is conducted to his presence  CANTO XXV  THE Araucanian delivers a defiance to Don Garcia in the name of Caupolican who challenges the Spanish General to end the war by a single combat The messenger adds that the whole Indian army will descend into the plain on the next morning to be spectators of the  duel Don Garcia dismisses him with an acceptance of the challenge At the dawn of day the Indian forces appear in three divisions A party of Spanish horse precipitately attack their left wing before which Caupolican was advancing They are repulsed A general and obstinate engagement ensues The mangled Galvarino appears at the head of one Indian squadron and excites his countrymen to revenge his wrongs Many Spaniards are named who distinguish themselves in the battle Among the Indian Chiefs Tucapel and Rengo display the most splendid acts of valour and though personal enemies they mutually defend each other Caupolican also at the head of the left squadron obliges the Spaniards to retreat and the Araucanians are on the point of gaining a decisive victory when the fortune of the day begins to turn  CANTO XXVI  THE reserved guard of the Spaniards in which Ercilla was stationed advancing to the charge recover the field and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly Caupolican though victorious in his quarter sounds a retreat when he perceives this event The Indians fly in great disorder Rengo for some time sustains an unequal conflict and at last retreats sullenly into a wood where he collects several of the scattered fugitives As Ercilla happened to advance towards this spot a Spaniard called Remon exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this Indian party from the wood His honour being thus piqued he rushes forward with a few followers and after an obstinate engagement in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces the Spaniards obtain the victory and return to their camp with several prisoners After this great defeat of the Indian army the Spaniards to deter their enemies from all future resistance barbarously resolve to execute twelve Chieftains of distinction whom they find among their captives and to leave their bodies exposed on the trees that surrounded the field of battle The generous Ercilla lamenting this inhuman sentence intercedes particularly for the life of one alledging  that he had seen him united with the Spaniards This person proves to be Galvarino who on hearing the intercession for his life produces his mangled arms which he had concealed in his bosom and giving vent to his detestation of the Spaniards insists on dying with his countrymen Ercilla persists in vain in his endeavour to save him As no executioner could be found among the Spanish soldiers a new mode of destruction says our Poet was invented and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him These brave men hastened to accomplish their fate with as much alacrity continues Ercilla as the most spirited warrior marches to an attack One alone of the twelve begins to hesitate and pray for mercy declaring himself the lineal descendant of the most ancient race and sovereign of the country He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galvarino and repenting his timidity atones for it by instant death  The Spaniards advance still farther in the country and raise a fort where Valdivia had perished Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more who tells him that Heaven thought proper to punish the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat but that the Spaniards would soon pay dearly for their present triumph The Wizard retires after this prophecy and with much intreaty allows Ercilla to follow him Coming to a gloomy rock he strikes it with his wand a secret door opens and they enter into a delicious garden which the Poet commends for its symmetry expressly declaring that every hedge  has its brother  The Magician leads him into a vault of alabaster and perceiving his wish though he does not express it of seeing the miraculous globe again the courteous Fiton conducts him to it  CANTO XXVII  THE Magician displays to our Poet the various countries of the globe particularly pointing out to him the ancient castle of Ercilla the seat of his ancestors in Biscay and the spot where his sovereign Philip the Second was soon to build his magnificent palace the Escurial Having shewn him the various nations of the earth on his marvellous sphere Fiton conducts his guest to the road leading to the  Spanish camp where the soldiers of Ercilla were seeking their officer The Spaniards in vain attempt to sooth and to terrify the Araucanians into peace and finding the importance of their present post they determine to strengthen it Ercilla proceeds with a party to the city of Imperial to provide necessaries for this purpose On his return as he is marching through the country of some pacific Indians he discovers at the close of day a distrest female who attempts to fly but is overtaken by Ercilla  CANTO XXVIII  THE fair fugitive whom our Poet describes as singularly beautiful relates her story She tells him her name is Glaura the daughter of an opulent Chieftain with whom she lived most happily till a brother of her father's who frequently resided with him persecuted her with an unwarrantable passionthat she in vain represented to him the impious nature of his lovehe persisted in his frantic attachment and on the appearance of a hostile party of Spaniards rushed forth to die in her defence intreating her to receive his departing spirit He fell in the action her father shared the same fate she herself escaped at a postern gate into the woods Two negroes laden with spoil discovered and seized her Her cries brought a young Indian named Cariolano to her rescue he shot an arrow into the heart of the first russian and stabbed the second Glaura expressed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her husband Before they could regain a place of safety they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal herself in a tree while he ventured to meet the enemy In her terror she submitted to this expedient which on recovery from her panic she bitterly repented for when she issued from her retreat she sought in vain for Cariolano and supposed from the clamour she had heard that he must have perished She continued to wander in this wretched state of mind still unable to hear any tidings of her protector While the fair Indian thus closes her narrative Ercilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians One of his faithful Indian attendants whom he had lately attached to him  intreats him to escape with the utmost haste adding that he can save him from pursuit by his knowledge of the country and that he will risque his own life most willingly to preserve that of Ercilla Glaura bursts into an agony of joy in discovering her lost Cariolano in this faithful attendant Ercilla exclaims  Adieu my friends I give you both your liberty which is all I have at present to bestow  and rejoins his little troop Before he enters on the account of what followed he relates the circumstance by which he attached Cariolano to his service whom he had found alone as he himself was marching with a small party and a few prisoners that he had taken The Youth at first defended himself and shot two Spaniards with his arrows and continued to resist the numbers that pressed upon him with his mantle and his dagger evading their blows by his extreme agility and wounding several Ercilla generously rushed in to his rescue and declared he deserved a reward for his uncommon bravery instead of being destroyed so unfairly The Youth in consequence of this treatment flung down his dagger and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla Our Poet after relating this incident returns to the scene where his party was surprized in a hollow road and severely galled by the enemy who attacked them with showers of stones from the higher ground Ercilla forces his way up the precipice and after dispersing part of the Indian force effects his escape with a few followers but all are wounded and obliged to leave their baggage in the possession of their numerous enemies  CANTO XXIX  OPENS with an encomium on the love of our country and the signal proofs of this virtue which the Araucanians displayed who notwithstanding their loss of four great battles in the space of three months still continue firm in their resolution of defending their liberty Caupolican proposes in a public assembly to set fire to their own habitations and leave themselves no alternative but that of killing or being killed The Chieftains all agree in this desperate determination Tucapel  before they proceed to action against the Spaniards insists on terminating his difference with Rengo a rival Chieftain by a single combat A plain is appointed for this purpose all the people of Arauco assemble as spectators the Chiefs appear in complete armour and engage in a most obstinate and bloody conflict  CANTO XXX  AFTER many dreadful wounds on each side the two Chiestains closing with each other fall together and after a fruitless struggle for victory remain speechless on the ground Caupolican who presided as judge of the combat descends from his seat and finding some signs of life in each orders them to be carried to their respective tents They recover and are reconciled The Spaniards leaving a garrison in their new fort under a captain named Reynoso had proceeded to the city of Imperial Caupolican endeavours to take advantage of this event He employs an artful Indian named Pran to examine the state of the fort Pran insinuates himself among the Indian servants belonging to the Spaniards He views the fort and endeavours to persuade a servile Indian named Andresillo to admit Caupolican and his forces while the Spaniards are sleeping Andresillo promises to meet Caupolican in secret and converse with him on this project  CANTO XXXI  OPENS with a spirited invective against treachery in war and particularly those traitors who betray their country Andresillo reveals all that had passed to his Spanish captain who promises him a great reward if he will assist in making the stratagem of the Indians an instrument of destruction to those who contrived it They concert a plan for this purpose Andresillo meets Caupolican in secret and promises to  introduce the Indian forces into the fort when the Spaniards are sleeping in the heat of the day Pran is sent forward to learn from Andresillo if all things are quiet just before the hour appointed for the assault He examines the state of the fort and finding the Spaniards apparently unprepared for defence hastens back to the Indian General who advances by a quick and silent march The Spaniards in the interim point all their guns and prepare for the most bloody resistance  CANTO XXXII  AFTER a panegyric on clemency and a noble censure of those enormous cruelties by which his countrymen sullied their military fame the P  the dreadful earnage which ensued as the Indians approached the fort The Spaniards after destroying numbers by their artillery s  nd f  rth a party of horse who cut the fugitives to pieces They inhumanly murder thirteen of their most distinguished prisoners by blowing them from the mouths of cannon but none of the considerate Chieftains whom the Poet has particularly celebrated were included in this number for those highspirited Barbarians had refused to attend Caupolican in this assault as they considered it as disgraceful to attack their enemies by surprize The unfortunate Indian Leader  eeing his forces thus unexpectedly massacred escapes with ten faithful followers and wanders through the country in the most calamitous condition The Spaniards endeavour by all the means they can devise to discover his retreat the faithful inhabitants of Arauco refuse to betray him  Ercilla in s  arching the country with a small party finds a young wounded  ▪  that marching with her husband she had the misfortune of seeing him perish in the late slaughterthat a friendly soldier in pity to her extreme distress had tried to end her miserable life in the midst of the confusion but had failed in his generous design by giving her an ineffectual woundthat she had been removed from the field of battle to that sequestered spot where she languished  in the hourly hope of death which she now implores from the hand of Ercilla Our Poet consoles her dresses her wound and leaves one of his attendants to protect her On his return to the fort he discourses to his soldiers in praise of the fidelity and spirit displayed by the Indian females comparing them to the chaste and constant Dido A young soldier of his train expresses his surprize on hearing Ercilla commend the Carthaginian Queen for a virtue to which he conceived she had no pretence From hence our Poet takes occasion to vindicate the injured Eliza from the slanderous misrepresentation of Virgil and flatters himself that the love of justice so natural to man will induce every reader to listen with pleasure to his defence of the calumniated Queen He then enters on her  real history  and relates circumstantially her lamentation over the murdered Sichaeus and the artifice by which she escaped with her treasures from her inhuman brother Pygmalionshe engages many of his attendants to share the chances of her voyage and having collected a supply of females from the island of Cyprus she directs her course to the coast of Africa  CANTO XXXIII  DIDO as our Poet continues her  more authentic story  purchases her dominion and raises her flourishing city The ambassadors of Iarbas arrive at Carthage to offer this celebrated Queen the alternative of marriage or war The Senate who are first informed of the proposal being fearful that the chaste resolutions of their fair Sovereign may ruin their country attempt to engage her by a singular device to accept the hand of Iarbas They tell her that this haughty Monarch has sent to demand twenty of her privy counsellors to regulate his kingdom and that in consideration of their age and infirmities they must decline so unpleasant a service The Queen represents to them the danger of their refusal and the duty which they owe to their country declaring that she would most readily sacrifice her own life for the safety or advantage of her subjects The Senators then reveal to her the real  demand of Iarbas and urge the necessity of her marriage for the preservation of the state The faithful Dido knows not what to resolve and demands three months to consider of this delicate and important point at the close of that period she assembles her subjects and taking leave of them in a very affectionate harangue declares her resolution to die as the only means by which she can at once satisfy both Heaven and earth by discharging her duty to her people and at the same time preserving her faith inviolate to her departed Sichaeus Invoking his name she plunges a poniard in her breast and throws herself on a flaming pile which had been kindled for a different sacrifice Her grateful subjects lament her death and pay divine honours to her memory "This  Este es el cierto y verdadero cuento  De la famosa Dido disfamada  Que Virgilio Maron sin miramiento  Falseó su historia y castidad preciada  Por dar a sus ficciones ornamento  Pues vemos que esta Reyna importunada  Pudiéndose casar y no quemarse  Antes quemarse quiso que casarse  says our Poet is the true and genuine story of the famous defamed Dido whose most honoured chastity has been belied by the inconsiderate Virgil to embellish his poetical fictions"  Our Poet returns from this digression on Dido to the fate of the Indian Leader CaupolicanOne of the prisoners whom the Spaniards had taken in their search after this unfortunate Chief is at last tempted by bribes to betray his General He conducts the Spaniards to a spot near the sequestered retreat of Caupolican and directs them how to discover it but refuses to advance with them overcome by his dread of the Hero whom he is tempted to betray The Spaniards surround the house in which the Chieftain had taken refuge with his ten faithful associates Alarmed by a centinel he prepares for defence but being soon wounded in the arm surrenders endeavouring to conceal his high character and to make the Spaniards believe him an ordinary soldier  With their accustom'd shouts and greedy toil  Our furious troops now riot in their spoil  Through the lone village their quick rapine spread  Nor leave unpillag'd e'en a single shed  When from a tent that plac'd on safer ground  The neighbouring hill's uncultur'd summit crown'd  A woman rush'd who in her hasty flight  Ran through the roughest paths along the rocky height  A Negro of our train who mark'd her way  Soon made the hapless fugitive his prey  For thwarting crags her doubtful steps impede  And the fair form was ill prepar'd for speed  For at her breast she bore her huddled son  To fifteen months the infant's life had run  From our brave captive sprung the blooming boy  Of both his parents the chief pride and joy  The Negro carelessly his victim brought  Nor knew th' important prize his haste had caught  Our soldiers now to catch the cooling tide  Had sallied to the murmuring river's side  When the unhappy Wife beheld her Lord  His strong arms bound with a disgraceful cord  Stript of each ensign of his past command  And led the pris'ner of our shouting band  Her anguish burst not into vain complaint  No female terrors her firm soul attaint  But breathing fierce disdain and anger wild  Thus she exclaim'd advancing with her child  The stronger arm that in this shameful band  Has tied thy weak effeminated hand  Had nobler pity to thy state exprest  If it had bravely pierc'd that coward breath  Wert thou the warrior whose heroic worth  So swiftly flew around the spacious earth  Whose name alone unaided by thy arm  Shook the remotest clime with fear's alarm  Wert thou the victor whose triumphant strain  Promis'd with rapid sword to vanquish Spain  To make new realms Arauco's power revere  And spread her empire o'er the Arctic sphere  Wretch that I am how was my heart deceiv'd  In all the noble pride with which it heav'd  When through the world my boasted title ran  Tresia the wife of great Caupolican  Now plung'd in misery from the heights of fame  My glories end in this detested shame  To see thee captive in a lonely spot  When death and honour might have been thy lot  What now avail thy scenes of happier strife  So dearly bought by many a nobler life  The wondrous feats that valour scarce believ'd  By thee with hazard and with toil atchiev'd  Where are the vaunted fruits of thy command  The laurels gather'd by this fetter'd hand  All sunk all turn'd to this abhorr'd disgrace  To live the slave of this ignoble race  Say had thy soul no strength thy hand no lance  To triumph o'er the fickle pow'r of chance  Dost thou not know that to the Warrior's name  A gallant exit gives immortal fame  Behold the burthen which my breast contains  Since of thy love no other pledge remains  Hadst thou in glory's arms resign'd thy breath  We both had follow'd thee in joyous death  Take take thy son he was a tie most dear  Which spotless love once made my heart revere  Take himby generous pain and wounded pride  The currents of this fruitful breast are dried  Rear him thyself for thy gigantic frame  To woman turn'd a woman's charge may claim  A mother's title I no more desire  Or shameful children from a shameful fire  As thus she spoke with growing madness stung  The tender nursling from her arms she flung  With savage fury hast'ning from our sight  While anguish seem'd to aid her rapid flight  Vain were our efforts our indignant cries  Nor gentle prayers nor angry threats suffice  To make her breast where cruel frenzy burn'd  Receive the little innocent the spurn'd  The Spaniards after providing a nurse for this unfortunate child return with their prisoner Caupolican to their fort which they enter in triumph  The Indian General perceiving that all attempts to conceal his quality are ineffectual desires a conference with the Spanish Captain Reynoso  CANTO XXXIV  CAUPOLICAN entreats Reynoso to grant his life but without any signs of terror He affirms it will be the only method of appeasing the sanguinary hatred by which the contending nations are inflamed and he offers from his great influence over his country to introduce the Christian worship and to bring the Araucanians to consider themselves as the subjects of the Spanish Monarch His proposals are rejected and he is sentenced to be impaled and shot to death with arrows He is unappall'd by this decree but first desires to be publicly baptized after which ceremony he is inhumanly led in chains to a scaffold He displays a calm contempt of death but on seeing a wretched Negro appointed his executioner his indignation bursts forth and he hurls the Negro from the scaffold entreating to die by a more honourable hand His horrid sentence is however executed He supports the agonies of the stake with patient intrepidity till a chosen band of archers put a period to his life  Our brave Ercilla expresses his abhorrence of this atrocious scene and adds that if he had been present this cruel execution should not have taken place  The consequence of it was such as Caupolican foretoldthe Araucanians determine to revenge his death and assemble to elect a new General  The Poet makes an abrupt transition from their debate to relate the adventures of Don Garcia with whom he was himself marching to explore new regions The inhabitants of the districts they invade alarmed at the approach of the Spaniards consult on the occasion An Indian named Tunconabala who had served under the Araucanians addresses the assembly and recommends to them a mode of eluding the supposed avaricious designs of the Spaniards by sending messengers to them who should assume an appearance of extreme poverty and represent their country as barren and thus induce the invaders to turn their arms towards a different quarter He offers to engage in this service himself The Indians adopt the project he recommends and remove their valuable effects to the interior parts of their country  CANTO XXXV  DON GARCIA being arrived at the boundaries of Chile which no Spaniard had passed encourages his soldiers in a spirited harangue to the acquisition of the new provinces which lay before them They enter a rude and rocky country in which they are exposed to many hazards by their deceitful guides Tunconabala meets them as he had projected with the appearance of extreme poverty and after many assurances of the sterility of that region advises them to return or to advance by a different path which he represents to them as dangerous but the only practicable road On finding them resolved to press forward he supplies them with a guide They advance with great toil and danger Their guide escapes from them They continue their march through various hardships in a desolate region They at length discover a fertile plain and a large lake with many little inhabited islands As they approach the lake a large gondola with twelve oars advances to meet them the party it contained leap ashore and salute the Spaniards with expressions of amity  CANTO XXXVI  THE young Chieftain of the gondola supplies the Spaniards with provisions refusing to accept any reward and our Poet celebrates all the inhabitants of this region for their amiable simplicity of manners He visits one of the principal islands where he is kindly entertained He discovers that the lake had a communication with the sea by a very rough and dangerous channel this circumstance obliges the Spaniards though reluctant to return They lament the necessity of passing again through the hardships of their former road A young Indian undertakes to conduct them by an easier way But our adventurous Ercilla before the little army set forth on their return engages ten chosen associates to embark with him in a small vessel and pass the dangerous channel He lands on a wild and sandy spot and advancing half a mile up the country engraves a stanza to record this adventure on the bark of a tree He repasses the channel and rejoins the Spanish troops who after much difficulty reach the city of Imperial Our Poet then touches on some particulars of his personal history which I mention in the slight sketch of his life He afterwards promises his reader to relate the issue of the debate among the Araucanian Chieftains on the election of their new General but recollecting in the instant that Spain herself is in arms he entreats the favour of his Sovereign to inspire him with new spirit that he may devote himself to that higher and more interesting subject  CANTO XXXVII  OUR Poet in this his last canto seems to begin a new work He enters into a discussion of Philip's right to the dominion of Portugal and his acquisition of that kingdom when sinking under the weight of this new subject he declares his resolution of leaving it to some happier Poet He recapitulates the various perils and hardships of his own life and remarking that he has ever been unfortunate and that all his labours are unrewarded he consoles himself with the reflection that  honour consists not in the possession of rewards but in the consciousness of having deserved them He concludes with a pious resolution to withdraw himself from the vain pursuits of the world and to devote himself to God  NOTE XI VERSE  At once the Bard of Glory and of Love  The Epic powers of Camoens have received their due honour in our language by the elegant and spirited translation of Mr Mickle but our country is still a stranger to the lighter graces and pathetic sweetness of his shorter compositions These as they are illustrated by the Spanish notes of his indefatigable Commentator  Manuel de Faria  amount to two volumes in folio I shall present the reader with a specimen of his Sonnets for which he is celebrated as the rival of Petrarch Of the three translations which follow I am indebted for the two first to an ingenious friend from whom the public may wish me to have received more extensive obligations of a similar nature It may be proper to add that the first Sonnet of Camoens like that of Petrarch is a kind of preface to the amorous poetry of its author  SONETO I  EM quanto quis Fortuna que tivesse  Esperanca de algum contentamento  O gosto de hum suave pensamento  Me fez que seus effeytos escrevesse  Porèm temendo Amor que aviso desse  Minha escritura a algum juizo isento  Escureccome o engenho co' o tormento  Para que seus enganos naō dissesse  O vós que amor obriga a ser sogeytos  A diversas vontades quando lerdes  Num breve livro casos taō diversos  Verdades puras saō naō defeytos  Entendey que segundo o amor tiverdes  Tircis o entendimento de meus versos  SONETO XIX  ALMA minha gentil que te partiste  Taō cedo desta vida descontente  Repousa lâ no ceo eternamente  E viva eu cà na terra sempre triste  Se là no assento etereo onde subiste  Memoria desta vida se consente  Naō te esquecas de aquelle amor ardente  Que já nos olhos meus taō puro viste  Ese vires que póde merecerte  Algūa cousa a dor queme sicou  Da magoa sem remedio de perderte  Roga a Deos que teus annos encurtou  Que taō cedo de câ me leve a verte  Quaō cedo de meur olhos te levou  SONNET I  WHILE on my head kind Fortune deign'd to pour  Her lavish boons and through my willing soul  Made tides of extasy and pleasure roll  I sung the raptures of each passing hour  But Love who heard me praise the golden shower  Resolv'd my fond presumption to controul  And painful darkness o'er my spirit stole  Lest I should dare to tell his treacherous power  O ye whom his hard yoke compels to bend  To others' will if in my various lay  Sad plaints ye find and fears and cruel wrong  To suffering nature and to truth attend  For in the measure ye have felt his sway  Your sympathizing hearts will feel my song  SONNET XIX ON THE DEATH OF THE POET'S MISTRESS DONNA CATALINA DE ATAIDE WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY  GO gentle spirit now supremely blest  From scenes of pain and struggling virtue go  From thy immortal seat of heavenly rest  Behold us lingering in a world of woe  And if beyond the grave to saints above  Fond memory still the transient past pourtrays  Blame not the ardor of my constant love  Which in these longing eyes was wont to blaze  But if from virtue's source my sorrows rise  For the sad loss I never can repair  Be thine to justify my endless sighs  And to the Throne of Grace prefer thy prayer  That Heaven who made thy span of life so brief  May shorten mine and give my soul relief  SONETO LXXII  QUANDO de minhas magoas a comprida  Maginaçaō os olhos me adormece  Em sonhos aquella alma me aparece  Que para mi foy sonho nesta vida  Lá numa soidade onde estendida  A vista por o campo desfallece  Corro apos ella ella entaō parece  Que maes de mi se alonga compelida  Brado Naō me fujays sombra benina  Ella os olhos em mi c'hum brado pejo  Como quem diz que ja naō pode ser  Torna a fugirme torno a bradar dina  E antes q' acabe em mene acordo vejo  Que nem hum breve engano posso ter  SONNET LXXII  WHILE prest with woes from which it cannot flee  My fancy sinks and number seals my eyes  Her spirit hastens in my dreams to rise  Who was in life but as a dream to me  O'er a drear waste so wide no eye can see  How far its senseevading limit lies  I follow her quick step but ah she flies  Our distance widening by stern Fate's decree  Fly not from me kind shadow I exclaim  She with fix'd eyes that her soft thoughts reveal  And seem to say "Forbear thy fond design"  Still fliesI call her but her halfform'd name  Dies on my falt'ring tongueI wake and feel  Not e'en one short delusion may be mine  The Spanish Commentator of Camoens considers this vision as the most exquisite Sonnet of his author and affirms that it is superior to the much longer poem of Petrarch's on a similar idea It may amuse a curious reader to compare both Camoens and Petrarch on this occasion with Milton who has also written a Sonnet on the same subject The Commentator Faria has a very pleasant remark on this species of composition He vindicates the dignity of the amorous Sonnet by producing an alphabetical list of two hundred great Poets who have thus complimented the object of their affection and he very gravely introduces Achilles as the leader of this choir for having celebrated Briseis If the Sonnets of the Portugueze Poet are worthy of attention his Elegies are perhaps still more so as they illustrate many particulars of his interesting life which ended in under the most cruel circumstances of neglect and poverty  Portugal has produced no less than fourteen Epic poems twelve in  her own language and two in that of Spain At the head of these stands the Lusiad of Camoens The Malaca Conquistada of Francisco de Sa' de Menesisand the Ulyssea or Lisboa Edificada of Gabriel Pereira de Castro are two of the most eminent among its successors For a list of the Portugueze Epic Poets and for an elegant copy of the Malaca Conquistada I am indebted to the very liberal politeness of the Chevalier de Pinto the Ambassador of Portugal  NOTE XII VERSE  Where Eulogy with one eternal smile  Though a vain insipidity may be considered as the general characteristic of the French  Eloges  it is but just to remark that several of these performances are an honour to the country which produced them and particularly the little volume of  Eloges  lately published by Mr D'Alembert This agreeable Encomiast  has varied and enlivened the tone of panegyric by the most happy mixture of amusing anecdote judicious criticism and philosophical precept we may justly say of him what he himself has said of his predecessor Fontenelle Il a solidement assuré sa gloire par ces Eloges si interessans pleins d'une raison si fine et si profonde qui font aimer et respecter les lettres qui inspirent aux génies naissans la plus noble emulation et qui feront passer le nom de l'auteur à la posterité avec celui de la compagnie célebre dont il a été le digne organe et des grands hommes dont il s'est rendu l'egal en devenant leur panégyriste  D'Alembert Eloge de la Motte p  NOTE XIII VERSE  No great Examples rise but many a Rule  Before the appearance of Bossu's celebrated treatise on Epic poetry the French had a similar work written in Latin The learned Jesuit Mambrun published in a quarto volume entitled Dissertatio Peripatetica de Epico Carmine His Dissertation is founded on the principles of Aristotle whom he considers as infallible authority and he introduces the Greek Philosopher to decide the following very curious question which he argues with becoming gravity Whether the action of a woman can be sufficiently splendid to prove a proper subject for an Epic poemHaving reasoned on this delicate point with more learning than gallantry he thus concludes the debate Congruenter magis finem huic quaestioni ponere non licet quam verbis Aristotelis capite Poeticae ubi de moribus disputat  id est secunda proprietas morum est ut sint congruentes ut esse fortem mos est aliquis at non congruit mulieri fortem esse aut terribilem ut vertit Riccobonus vel  prudentem  ut Pacius The latter interpretation of the word  would render the decision of these Philosophers very severe indeed on the Female character by supposing it incapable of displaying both fortitude and prudenceThe Fair Sex have found an advocate on this occasion in a French Epic Poet The famous Chapelain in the preface to his unfortunate Pucelle has very warmly attacked these ungallant maxims of Mambrun and Aristotle In speaking of certain critics who had censured the choice of his subject before the publication of his poem he says Ceuxcy jurant sur le texte d'Aristote  maintiennent que la femme est une erreur de la nature qui ayant toujours intention de faire un homme s'arreste souvent en chemin et se voit contrainte par la resistance de la matiere de laisser son dessein imparfait Ils tienne  t la force corporelle tellement necessaire dans la composition d'un heros que quand il n'y auroit autre defaut à reprocher à la femme ils luy en refuseroient le nom pour cela seulement qu'elle n'a pas la vigueur d'un Athlete et que la mollesse de sa complexion l'empesche de pouvoir durer au travail Ils n'estiment ce Sexe capable d'aucune pensée heroique dans la creance que l'esprit suit le temperament du corps et que dans le corps de la femme l'esprit ne peut rien concevoir qui ne se sente de sa foiblesse Ces Messieurs me pardonneront toutefois si je leur dis qu'ils ne considerent pas trop bien quelle est la nature de la vertu heroique qu'ils en definissent l'essence par un de ses moindres accidens et qu'ils en font plutost une vertu brutale qu'une vertu divine Ils se devroient souvenir que cette vertu n'a presque rien à faire avec le corps et qu'elle consiste non dans les efforts d'un Milon de Crotone où l'esprit n'a aucune part mais en ceux des ames nées pour les grandes choses quand par une ardeur plusqu' humaine elles s'elevent audessus d'ellesmesmes qu'elles forment quelque dessein dont l'utilité est aussi grande que la difficulté et qu'elles choisissent les moyens de l'executer avec constance et hauteur de courage Pour prevenus qu'ils soient en faveurs des hommes je ne pense pas qu'ils voulussent attribuer à leur ame un seul avantage auquel l'ame de la femme ne pust aspirer ni faire deux especes des deux sexes desquels la raison de tous les sages n'a fait qu'une jusqu'icyje ne croy pas non plus qu'ils imaginent que les vertus morales ayent leur siege ailleurs que dans la volonté ou dans l'entendement Mais si elles y ont leur siege et si l'on ne peut dire que ces deux facultés soient autres dans l'ame de la femme que dans l'ame de l'homme ils ne peuvent sans absurdité accorder une de ces vertus à l' homme et ne l' accorder pas à la femme En effet cette belle pensée d'Aristote qui a donné occasion à leur erreur est si peu physique qu'elle fait plus de tort à la philosophie du Lycée qu'elle n'appuye l'opinion de ceux que nous combattons" Chapelain then enters into an historical defence of Female dignity and opposes the authority of Plato to that of Aristotle concerning the propriety of woman's ever appearing on the great theatre of active life Happy had he supported  the Female cause as forcibly in the execution of his poem as in the arguments of his preface but Chapelain was unfortunately one of the many examples which every country affords that the most perfect union of virtue and erudition is utterly insufficient to form a Poet and as he had the ill fate to be persecuted by the pitiless rigour of Boileau his inharmonious poem can never sink into a desirable oblivion The treatise of Mambrun seems to have excited among the French an eagerness to distinguish themselves in the field of Epic poetry for several Epic poems were published in France in a few years after that work appeared but most of them and particularly those on scriptural subjects were hardly ever known to exist  Le Jonas inconnu seche dans la poussiere  Le David imprimé n'a point vu la lumiere  Le Moïse commence à moisir par les bords  BOILEAU Sat ix  The Alaric of Scudery and the Clovis of Desmarests can scarce be reckoned more fortunate but in this band of unsuccessful Epic writers there was one Poet of whom even the severe Boileau could not allow himself to speak ill this was Le Moine the author of St Louis The Satirist being asked why he had never mentioned the poetry of Le Moine replied with the two following verses parodied from Corneille  Il s'est trop élevé pour en dire du mal  Il s'est trop égaré pour en dire du bien  The judicious and candid Heyne has bestowed considerable applause on Le Moine in one of his notes to the th book of Virgil where he examines the different methods by which the Epic Poets have introduced their various pictures of futurity From his account Le Moine excels in this article I can speak only from the opinion of this learned Critic for the neglected French Poet is become so rare that I have sought in vain for a copy of his workThe number of obscure Epic writers in France is very trifling compared to those which Italy has produced the Italians have been indefatigable in this species of composition and as if they had resolved to leave no Hero unsung their celebrated Novelist Giraldi  Cinthio has written an Epic poem in twentysix cantos on the exploits of Hercules  NOTE XIV VERSE  Keen Boileau shall not want his proper praise  Nicolas Boileau Despreaux was born  in  or  near  Paris for it is a contested point on the first of November and died in March of a dropsy the very disease which terminated the life of his English rival The Lutrin of Boileau still considered by some French Critics of the present time as the best poem to which France has given birth was first published in It is with great reason and justice that Voltaire confesses the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock Few Poets can be so properly compared as Pope and Boileau and wherever their writings will admit of comparison we may without any national partiality adjudge the superiority to the English Bard These two great authors resembled each other as much in the integrity of their lives as in the subjects and execution of their several compositions There are two actions recorded of Boileau which sufficiently prove that the inexorable Satirist had a most generous and friendly heart when Patru the celebrated Advocate who was ruined by his passion for literature found himself under the painful necessity of selling his expensive library and had almost agreed to part with it for a moderate sum Boileau gave him a much superior price and after paying the money added this condition to the purchase that Patru should retain during his life the possession of the books The succeeding instance of the Poet's generosity is yet nobler when it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the pension of Corneille Boileau hastened to Madame de Montespan and said that his Sovereign equitable as he was could not without injustice grant a pension to an author like himself just ascending Parnassus and take it from Corneille who had so long been seated on the summit that he entreated her for the honour of the King to prevail on his Majesty rather to strike off  his  pension than to withdraw that reward from a man whose title to it was incomparably greater and that he should more easily console himself under the loss of that distinction than under the affliction of seeing it taken away from such a Poet as Corneille This magnanimous application had the success which it deserved and it  appears the more noble when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the intimate friend of Boileau  The long and unreserved intercourse which subsisted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both The dying farewell of the latter is the most expressive eulogy on the private character of Boileau Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous said the tender Racine in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend  NOTE XV VERSE  Nor gentle Gresset shall thy sprightly rhyme  This elegant and amiable writer was born at Amiens and educated in the society of the Jesuits to whom he has paid a grateful compliment in bidding them adieu At the age of twentysix he published his Ververt a poem in four cantos which commemorates  La cause infortunée  D'un Perroquet non moins brillant qu' Enée  Non moins dévot plus malheureux que lui  Voltaire has spoken invidiously of this delightful performance but a spirited French Critic has very justly vindicated the merits of Gresset in the following remarkLe Ververt sera toujours un poeme charmant et inimitable sans souiller sa plume par l'impiété et la licence qui deshonorent celle de l'auteur de  La Pucelle  le Poete a su y répandre un agrément une fraîcheur et une vivacité de coloris qui le rendent aussi piquant dans les détails qu'il est riche et ingénieux dans la fiction On placera toujours cet agreable badinage parmi les productions originales propres à faire aimer des etrangers la gaieté Françoise en écartant toute mauvaise idée de nos moeurs  NOTE XVI VERSE  See lovely Boccage in ambition strong  Madame du Boccage is known to the English reader as the correspondent of Lord Chesterfield This ingenious and spirited Lady has written three poems of the Epic kindLe Paradis Terrestre in six cantos from Milton La Mort d'Abel in five  cantos from Gesner and a more original composition in ten cantos on the exploits of Columbus I have alluded to a passage in the last poem where Zama the daughter of an Indian Chief is thus described  Comme Eve elle etoit nue une egale innocence  L'offre aux regards sans honte et voile ses appas  Les Graces qu'elle ignore accompagnent ses pas  Et pour tout vêtement en formant sa parure  D'un plumage azuré couvrirent sa ceinture  The works of this elegant female Poet contain an animated version of Pope's Temple of Fame And she has added to her poetry an account of her travels through England Holland and Italy in a series of entertaining letters addressed to Madame du Perron her sister  NOTE XVII VERSE  To swell the glory of her great Voltaire  Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to support its reputation it seems at length to be sinking under that neglect and oblivion which never fail to overtake every feeble offspring of the Epic Muse Several of our most eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar severity and some have condemned it on the most opposite principles merely because it does not coincide with their respective systems Their sentence has been passed only in short and incidental remarks but a French writer inflamed by personal animosity against Voltaire has raised three octavo volumes on the defects of this single poem Mr Clement in his  "Entretiens sur le Poeme Epique relativement à la Henriade"  has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the essential points of Epic poetryin the structure of its general plan in the conduct of its various parts in sentiment in character in style His work indeed displays an acrimonious detestation of the Poet whom he examines and perhaps there is hardly any human composition which could support the scrutiny of so rigid an inquisitor the Henriade is utterly unequal to it for in many articles we are obliged to confess that the justice of the Critic is not inferior to his severity He discovers in his dissection of the  Poem the skill of an anatomist with the malignity of an assassin If any thing can deserve such rigorous treatment it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire who in his Essay on Epic Poetry has attempted with much ingenuity to sink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers that he might raise himself to their level an attempt in which no author can ultimately succeed for as D'Alembert has admirably remarked on a different occasion Le public laissera l'amour propre de chaque ecrivain faire son plaidoyer rira de leurs efforts non de genie mais de raisonnement pour hausser leur place et finira par mettre chacun à la sienne  NOTE XVIII VERSE  And shrouded in a mist of moral spleen  It seems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope that his moral virtues have had a tendency to diminish his poetical reputation Possessing a benevolent spirit and wishing to make the art to which he devoted his life as serviceable as he could to the great interests of mankind he soon quitted the higher regions of poetry for the more level and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire He declares with a noble pride arising from the probity of his intention  That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long  But stoop'd to truth and moraliz'd his song  The severity of Criticism has from hence inferred that his imagination was inferior to the other faculties of his mind and that he possessed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more sublime and pathetic Bards This inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in reason it would surely be more generous and I will venture to add more just to assign very different causes for his having latterly applied himself to moral and satyric composition If his preceding poems displayed only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderness we might indeed very fairly conjecture that he quitted the kind of poetry where these qualities are particularly required because Nature directed him to shine only as the Poet of reasonBut his earlier productions will authorize an opposite conclusion At an age when few authors have produced any capital work Pope gave the world two poems  one the offspring of imagination and the other of sensibility which will ever stand at the head of the two poetical classes to which they belong his Rape of the Lock and his Eloise have nothing to fear from any rivals either of past or of future time When a writer has displayed such early proofs of exquisite fancy and of tender enthusiasm those great constituents of the real Poet ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater scope and freer exercise to these qualities rather than to assert that he did not possess them in a superlative degree Why then it may be asked did he confine himself to compositions in which these have little share The life and character of Pope will perfectly explain the reasons why he did not always follow the higher suggestions of his own natural genius He had entertained an opinion that by stooping to truth and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the passing time he should be most able to benefit mankind The idea was perhaps illfounded but his conduct in consequence of it was certainly noble Its effects however were most unhappy for it took from him all his enjoyment of life and may injure in some degree his immortal reputation by suffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools he fell into the splenetic delusion that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly and from hence he has been reproached for supposing that all human merit was confined to himself and to a few of his most intimate correspondents  There was an amiable peculiarity in the character of Pope which had great influence both on his conduct and compositionhe embraced the sentiments of those he loved with a kind of superstitious regard his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affectionate heart it was this which led him at the request of his idol Bolingbroke to write a sublime poem on metaphysical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend it was this which urged him almost to quarrel with Mr Allen in compliance with the caprices of a female friend it was this which induced him in the warmth of gratitude to follow the absurd hints of Warburton with all the blindness of infatuated affection Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a minute and unprejudiced attention will find that his excellencies both as a Poet and a Man were peculiarly his own and that his failings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment or the artifice of his real and pretended  friends The lavish applause and the advice of his favourite Atterbury was perhaps the cause of his preserving the famous character of Addison which finely written as it is all the lovers of Pope must wish him to have suppressed Few of his friends had integrity or frankness sufficient to persuade him that his satires would destroy the tranquillity of his life and cloud the lustre of his fame yet to the honour of Lyttelton be it remembered that he suggested such ideas to the Poet in the verses which he wrote to him from Rome with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friendship  No more let meaner Satire dim the rays  That flow majestic from thy nobler bays  In all the flowery paths of Pindus stray  But shun that thorny that unpleasing way  Nor when each soft engaging Muse is thine  Address the least attractive of the Nine  This generous admonition did not indeed produce its intended effect for other counsellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet and the malignity of his enemies had exasperated his temper yet he afterwards turned his thoughts towards the composition of a national Epic poem and possibly in consequence of the hint which this Epistle of Lyttelton contains The intention was formed too late for it arose in his decline of life Had he possessed health and leisure to execute such a work I am persuaded it would have proved a glorious acquisition to the literature of our country the subject indeed which he had chosen must be allowed to have an unpromising appearance but the opinion of Addison concerning his Sylphs which was surely honest and not invidious may teach us hardly ever to decide against the intended works of a superior genius Yet in all the Arts we are perpetually tempted to pronounce such decisions I have frequently condemned subjects which my friend Romney had selected for the pencil but in the sequel my opinion only proved that I was nearsighted in those regions of imagination where his keener eyes commanded all the prospect  NOTES TO THE FOURTH EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  PROCEED ye Sisters of the tuneful Shell  For the advice which I have thus ventured to give such of my fair readers as have a talent for poetry I shall produce them a much higher poetical authority In the age of Petrarch an Italian Lady named Giustina Perrot was desirous of distinguishing herself by this pleasing accomplishment but the remarks of the world which represented it as improper for her sex discouraged her so far that she was almost tempted to relinquish her favourite pursuit In her doubts on this point she consulted the celebrated Poet of her country in an elegant Sonnet and received his answer on the interesting subject in the same poetical form I shall add the two Sonnets with an imitation of each  IO vorrei pur drizzar queste mie piume  Colà Signor dove il desio n'invita  E dopo morte rimaner' in vita  Col chiaro di virtute inclyto lume  Ma' volgo inerte che dal rio costume  Vinto ha d' ogni suo ben la via smarrita  Come degna di biasmo ogn' hor m' addita  Ch' ir tenti d' Elicona al sacro fiume  All ago al fuso piu ch' al lauro o al mirto  Come che qui non sia la gloria mia  Vuol ch' habbia sempre questa mente intesa  Dimmi tu hormai che per piu dritta via  A Parnasso t' en vai nobile spirto  Dovrò dunque lasciar si degna impresa  LA gola e'l sonno e l' oziose piume  Hanno del mondo ogni virtù sbandita  Ond' è dal corso suo quasi smarrita  Nostra natura vinta dal costume  Ed è si spento ogni benigno lume  Del ciel per cui s' informa umana vita  Che per cosa mirabile s' addita  Chi vuol far d' Elicona nascer fiume  Qual vaghezza di lauro qual di mirto  Povera e nuda vai filosofia  Dice la turba al vil guadagno intesa  Pochi compagni avrai per l'altra via  Tanto ti prego più gentile spirto  Non lasciar la magnanima tua impresa  THE SONNET OF GIUSTINA TO PETRARCH  GLADLY would I exchange inglorious ease  For future fame the Poet's fond desire  And still to live in spite of death aspire  By Virtue's light that darkness cannot seize▪  But stupified by Custom's blank decrees  The idle vulgar void of liberal fire  Bid me with scorn from Helicon retire  And rudely blame my generous hope to please  Distaffs not laurels to your sex belong  They cryas honour were beyond our view  To such low cares they with my spirit bent  Say thou who marchest 'mid the favor'd few  To high Parnassus with triumphant song  Should I abandon such a fair intent  THE ANSWER OF PETRARCH  LUXURIOUS pleasure and lethargic ease  Have deaden'd in the world each bright desire  Our thoughts no more with Nature's force aspire  Custom's cold powers the drooping fancy seize  So lost each light that taught the soul to please  Each heavenly spark of lifedirecting fire  That all who join the Heliconian choir  Are frantic deem'd by Folly's dull decrees  What charms what worth to Laurelwreaths belong  Naked and poor Philosophy we view  Exclaims the crowd on sordid gain intent  Associates in thy path thou'lt find but few  The more I pray thee Nymph of graceful song  Indulge thy spirit in its noble bent  NOTE II VERSE  As wounded Learning blushes to recite  Milton sold the copy of Paradise Lost for the sum of five pounds on the condition of receiving fifteen pounds more at three subsequent periods to be regulated by the sale of the PoemFor the ceiling at Whitehall Rubens received three thousand pounds  NOTE III VERSE  Receive the Laurel from imperial Charles  Ariosto is said to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua by the Emperor Charles the Vth towards the end of the year This fact has been disputed by various writers but it seems to be sufficiently established by the researches of Mazzuchelli  The custom of crowning Poets with laurel is almost as ancient as poetry itself says the Abbé du Resnel in his Recherches sur les Poetes couronnez a work which contains but scanty information on this curious topic Petrarch is generally supposed to have revived this ancient solemnity which had been abolished as a pagan institution in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius It appears however from two passages in the writings of Boccacio that Dante had entertained serious thoughts of this honourable distinction which his exile precluded him from receiving as he chose says his Biographer to be crown'd only in his native city  An amusing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages and in various parts of the world It is remarkable that the most unpolished nations have been the most lavish in rewarding their Bards There are two instances on record in which poetical talents have raised their possessors even to sovereign dominion The Scythians chose the Poet Thamyris for their king though he was not a native of their country  Hist Poet Script Edit Gale p Saxo Grammaticus begins the sixth book of his History by relating that the Danes bestowed their vacant diadem on the Poet Hiarnus as a reward for his having composed the best epitaph on their deceased sovereign Frotho From the four Latin verses which the Historian has given us as a  translation of this extraordinary epitaph we may venture to affirm that the poetical monarch obtain'd his crown on very easy conditions  NOTE IV VERSE  For him her fountains gush with golden streams  Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet his friend and biographer Montalvan has given a particular account This author concludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a sum nearly equal to pounds sterling the revenue arising from the posts he held and from his pension was very considerable His opulence was much encreased by the most splendid instances of private liberality He received many costly presents from various characters to whom he was personally unknown and he was himself heard to say in speaking of his generous patron that the Duke of Sessa alone had given him at different periods of his life sums almost amounting to six thousand pounds  It must be confessed that the noble patrons of English poetry have not equalled this example of Spanish munificence even if we admit the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the generosity of Lord Southampton to Shakespeare and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spenser Considering the liberality for which our nation is so justly celebrated it is remarkable that not a single English Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs yet Spenser had every claim to the bounty of Elizabeth he sung her praises in a strain which might gratify her pride and of all who have flattered the great he may justly be considered as the most worthy of reward His song was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy and the sex of his idol may be said to purify his incense from all the offensive particles of servile adulation The neglect which he experienced from the vain imperious and ungrateful Elizabeth appears the more striking when we recollect that her lovely rival the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots signalized her superior generosity by a magnificent present of plate to the French Poet Ronsard This neglected Bard was once the darling of France and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received his sovereign Charles the Ninth composed some elegant verses in his praise and the city of Toulouse presented him with a Minerva of massive silver  If our princes and nobles have not equalled those of other kingdoms in liberality to the great Poets of their country England may yet boast the name of a private gentleman who discovered in this respect a most princely spirit no nation either ancient or modern can produce an example of munificence more truly noble than the annual gratuity which Akenside received from Mr Dyson a tribute of generous and affectionate admiration endeared to its worthy possessor by every consideration which could make it honourable both to himself and to his patron  It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accomplished writer who had too much reason for the complaint that  the profession of Literature by far the most laborious of any leads to no real benefit  Experience undoubtedly proves that it has a general tendency to impoverish its votaries and the legislators of every country would act perhaps a wise at all events an honourable part if they corrected this tendency by establishing public emoluments for such as eminently distinguish themselves in the various branches of science It is surely possible to form such an establishment which without proving a national burthen might aggrandize the literary glory of the nation by preserving her men of letters from the evils so frequently connected with their pursuits by securing to those who deserve it the possession of ease and honour without damping their emulation or destroying their independence  NOTES TO THE FIFTH EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  THE loose Petronius gave the maxim birth  Aristotle has said but little in his Poetics concerning that weighty point which has so much employed and embarrassed the modern Criticsthe machinery of the Epic poem and the little which he has said might rather furnish an argument for its exclusion than justify its use But Rome in her most degenerate days produced a writer to whose authority contemptible as it is most frequent appeals have been made in this curious literary question In almost every modern author who has touched however slightly on Epic poetry we may find at least some part of the following sentence from Petronius ArbiterEcce Belli civilis ingens opus quisquis attigerit nisi plenus litteris sub onere labetur Non enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt quod longe melius historici faciunt sed per ambages deorumque ministeria fabulosum sententiarum tormentum praecipitandus est liber spiritus ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides  These remarks on the necessity of celestial agents were evidently made to depreciate the Pharsalia of Lucan and Petronius may be called a fair Critic as Pope said of Milbourne on his opposition to Dryden because he produces his own poetry in contrast to that which he condemns His specimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem should be conducted sufficiently proves the absurdity of his criticism  for how insipid is the fable in those verses which he has opposed to the Pharsalia when compared to the first book of Lucan Yet the Epic composition of Petronius has not wanted admirers a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to say that he prefers this single rhapsody to three hundred volumes of such poetry as Lucan's an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau  Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire  If men of letters in the age of Lucan differed in their sentiments concerning machinery the great changes that have since happened in the world and the disquisitions which have appeared on the subject are very far from having reconciled the judgment of modern writers on this important article Two eminent Critics of the present time have delivered opinions on this topic so singularly opposite to each other that I shall transcribe them both  In a theatrical entertainment which employs both the eye and the ear it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior Beings in a visible shape There is not place for such objection in an Epic poem and Boileau with many other Critics declares strongly for that fort of machinery in an Epic poem But waving authority which is apt to impose upon the judgment let us draw what light we can from reason I begin with a preliminary remark that this matter is but indistinctly handled by Critics The poetical privilege of animating insensible objects for enlivening a description is very different from what is termed  machinery  where deities angels devils or other supernatural powers are introduced as real personages mixing in the action and contributing to the catastrophe and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reasoning The former is founded on a natural principle but can the latter claim the same authority So far from it that nothing is more unnatural Its effects at the same time are deplorable First it gives an air of fiction to the whole and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections and to move our passions which of itself is sufficient to explode machinery whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination  And next were it possible by disguising the fiction to delude us into a notion of reality which I think can hardly be an insuperable objection would still remain which is that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced for an evident reason that virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endued with passions and affections like our own that is by human actions and as for moral instruction it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the same principles with us Homer it is true introduces the Gods into his fable but the religion of his country authorized that liberty it being an article in the Grecian creed that the Gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs I must however observe that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems Fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect they may inflame the imagination for a moment but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste They may be of some use to the lower rank of writers but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his subject and making it interestingVoltaire in his Essay upon Epic Poetry talking of the Pharsalia observes judiciously that the proximity of time the notoriety of events the character of the age enlightened and Political joined with the solidity of Lucan's subject deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction Is it not amazing that a Critic who reasons so justly with respect to others can be so blind with respect to himself Voltaire not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior Beings introduces them into the action In the sixth canto of the Henriade St Louis appears in person and terrifies the soldiers in the seventh canto St Louis sends the God of Sleep to Henry and in the tenth the demons of Discord Fanaticism War c assist Aumale in a single combat with Turenne and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals makes a bad figure at any rate and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV This singly is sufficient to make the Henriade a shortlived poem were it otherwise possessed of every beauty  Elements of Criticism  vol ii p th edition  The Pagan Gods and Gothic Fairies were equally out of credit when Milton wrote He did well therefore to supply their room with Angels and Devils If these too should wear out of the popular creed and they seem in a hopeful way from the liberty some late Critics have taken with them I know not what other expedients the Epic Poet might have recourse to but this I knowthe pomp of verse the energy of description and even the finest moral paintings would stand him in no stead Without  admiration  which cannot be effected but by the marvellous of celestial intervention I mean the agency of superior natures really existing or by the illusion of the fancy taken to be so no Epic poem can be longlived I am not afraid to instance in the Henriade itself which notwithstanding the elegance of the composition will in a short time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W Davenant and for the same reason  Letters on Chivalry and Romance  Letter X  I have thus ventured to confront these eminent critical antagonists that while they engage and overthrow each other we may observe the injustice produced by the spirit of systematical criticism even in authors most respectable for their talents and eruditionHere is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires which equally destroy him The  first  Critic asserts that the Henriade must be shortlived because the Poet  has introduced invisible and superior agents  the  second  denounces the same fate against it because  it wants  the  agency of superior natures  yet surely every reader of poetry who is not influenced by any particular system will readily allow that if Voltaire had treated his subject with true Epic spirit in all other points neither the introduction nor the absence of St Louis could be singly sufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion Indeed the learned author who has spoken in so peremptory a manner concerning the necessity of supernatural agents to preserve the existence of an Epic poem appears rather unfortunate in the two examples by which he endeavours to support his doctrine for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have sufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot without considering the article of Machinery  If I have warmly opposed any decisions of this exalted Critic it is  from a persuasion in which I may perhaps be mistaken that  some  of his maxims have a strong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both an art on which his genius and learning have cast  many  rays of pleasing and of useful light  NOTE II VERSE  But howling dogs the fancied Orpheus tore  This anecdote of Neanthus the son of King Pittacus is related by Lucian The curious reader may find it in the second volume of Dr Francklin's spirited translation of that lively author page of the quarto edition  NOTE III VERSE  And spotless Laurels in that field be won  The Indian mythology as it has lately been illustrated in the writings of Mr Holwell is finely calculated to answer the purpose of any poetical genius who may wish to introduce new machinery into the serious Epic Poem Besides the powerful charm of novelty it would have the advantage of not clashing with our national religion for the endeavours of Mr Holwell to reconcile the ancient and pure doctrine of Bramah with the dispensation of Christ have so far succeeded that if his system does not satisfy a theologist it certainly affords a sufficient basis for the structure of a Poet In perusing his account of the Indian scripture every reader of imagination may I think perceive that the Shastah might supply a poetical spirit with as rich a mass of ideal treasure as fancy could with to work uponAn Epic Poet desirous of laying the scene of his action in India would be more embarrassed to find interesting Heroes than proper Divinities Had justice and generosity inspired and guided that English valour which has signalized itself on the plains of Indostan had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native Indians from the oppressive usurpation of the Mahometan powers such exploits would present to the Epic Muse a subject truly noble and the mythology of the East might enrich it with the most splendid decorations Whether it be possible or not to find such a subject in the records of our Indian history I leave the reader to determineOur great Historian of the Roman empire has intimated in a note to the first volume of his immortal work that  the wonderful expedition of Odin which deduces  the enmity of the Goths and Romans from so memorable a cause might supply the noble groundwork of an Epic poem  The idea is certainly both just and splendid Had Gray been ever tempted to engage in such a work he would probably have convinced us that the Northern mythology has still sufficient power to seize and enchant the imagination as much in Epic as in Lyric composition  It may amuse our speculative Critics to consider how far the  religious Gothic fables  should be introduced or rejected to render such a performance most interesting to a modern reader Few judges would agree in their sentiments on the question and perhaps the great dispute concerning Machinery cannot be fairly adjusted till some happy genius shall possess ambition and perseverance enough to execute two Epic poems in the one adopting and in the other rejecting supernatural agents for Reason alone is by no means an infallible conductor in the province of Fancy and in the poetical as well as the philosophical world experiment is the surest guide to truth  FINIS  ERRATA  EPISTLE II  Ver for  where  read  whence  for  Critic  read  Critics  EPISTLE IV  Ver for  keep
