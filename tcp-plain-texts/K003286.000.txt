DRAMATIS PERSONAE  SWEET are yon Hills that crown this fertile Vale  Ye genial Springs PIERIAN Waters hail  Hail Woods and Lawns Yesoft I'll tread  Yon' Pineclad Mountain's Side  Oft trace the gay enamel'd Mead  Where AVON rolls his Pride  Sure next to fair CASTALIA's Streams  And PINDUS' flow'ry Path  APOLLO most the Springs esteems  And verdant Meads of  Bath  The Muses haunt these hallow'd Groves  And here their Vigils keep  Here teach fond Swains their hapless Loves  In gentle Strains to weep  From Water sprung like Flow'rs from Dew  What Troops of Bards appear  The God of Verse and Physic too  Inspires them twice a Year  Take then my Friend the sprightly Rhyme  While you inglorious waste your Prime  At Home in cruel Durance pent  On dull domestic Cares intent  Forbid by Parent's harsh Decree  To share the Joys of  Bath  with me  Illjudging Parent blind to Merit  Thus to confine a Nymph of Spirit  With all thy Talents doom'd to fade  And wither in th' unconscious Shade  I vow my Dear it moves my Spleen  Such frequent Instances I've seen  Of Fathers cruel and unkind  To all paternal Duty blind  What Wretches do we meet with often  Whose Hearts no Tenderness can soften  Sure all good Authors should expose  Such Parents both in Verse and Prose  And Nymphs inspire with Resolution  Ne'er to submit to Persecution  This wholesome Satyr much enhances  The Merit of our best Romances  And modern Plays that I could mention  With Judgment fraught and rare Invention  Are wrote with much the same Intention  But thank my Stars that worthy Pair  Who undertook a Guardian's Care  My Spirit never have confin'd  An Instance of their gen'rous Mind  For Lady BNRD my Aunt  Herself propos'd this charming Jaunt  All from Redundancy of Care  For SIM her fav'rite Son and Heir  To him the joyous Hours I owe  That  Bath  's enchanting Scenes bestow  Thanks to her Book of choice Receipts  That pamper'd Him with sav'ry Meats  Nor less that Day deserves a Blessing  She cramm'd his Sister to Excess in  For now she sends both Son and Daughter  For Crudities to drink the Water  And here they are all Bile and Spleen  The strangest Fish that e'er were seen  With TABBY RUNT their Maid poor Creature  The queerest Animal in Nature  I'm certain none of HOGARTH's Sketches  E'er form'd a Set of stranger Wretches  I own my Dear it hurts my Pride  To see them blund'ring by my Side  My Spirits flag my Life and Fire  Is mortify'd  au Desespoir  When SIM unfashionable Ninny  In Public calls me  Cousin Jenny  And yet to give the Wight his Due  He has some Share of Humour too  A comic Vein of pedant Learning  His Conversation you'll discern in  The oddest Compound you can see  Of Shrewdness and Simplicity  With nat'ral Strokes of aukward Wit  That oft like Parthian Arrows hit  For when He seems to dread the Foe  He always strikes the hardest Blow  And when you'd think He means to flatter  His Panegyrics turn to Satire  But then no Creature you can find  Knows half so little of Mankind  Seems always blund'ring in the dark  And always making some Remark  Remarks that so provoke one's Laughter  One can't imagine what he's after  And sure you'll thank me for exciting  In SIM a wondrous Itch for Writing  With all his serious Grimace  To give Descriptions of the Place  No Doubt his Mother will produce  His Poetry for gen'ral Use  And if his Bluntness does not fright you  His Observations must delight you  For truly the good Creature's Mind  Is honest generous and kind  If unprovok'd will ne'er displease ye  Or ever make one Soul uneasy  I'll try to make his Sister PRUE  Take a small Trip to  Pindus  too  And me the Nine shall all inspire  To tune for Thee the warbling Lyre  For Thee the Muse shall ev'ry Day  Speed by the Post her rapid Way  For Thee my Friend I'll oft explore  Deep Treasures of Romantic Lore  Nor wonder if I Gods create  As all good Bards have done of late  'Twill make my Verse run smooth and even  To call new Deities from Heaven  Come then thou Goddess I adore  But softmy Chairman's at the Door  The Ball's begunmy Friend no more  JWDR  BATH    Mr SBNRD to Lady BNRD atHall North  LETTER II  Mr  BNRD  's Reflections on his Arrival at  Bath  The Case of Himself and CoThe Acquaintance He commences  c c  WE all are a wonderful Distance from Home  Two Hundred and Sixty long Miles are we come  And sure you'll rejoice my dear Mother to hear  We are safely arriv'd at the Sign of the Bear  'Tis a plaguy long Waybut I ne'er can repine  As my Stomach is weak and my Spirits decline  For the People say herebe whatever your Case  You are sure to get well if you come to this Place  Miss JENNY made Fun as she always is wont  Of PRUDENCE my Sister and TABITHA RUNT  And every Moment she heard me complain  Declar'd I was vapour'd and laugh'd at my Pain  What tho' at  Devizes  I fed pretty hearty  And made a good Meal like the rest of the Party  When I came here to  Bath  not a Bit could I eat  Though the Man at the Bear had provided a Treat  And so I went quite out of Spirits to Bed  With Wind in my Stomach and Noise in my Head  As we all came for Health as a Body may say  I sent for the Doctor the very next Day  And the Doctor was pleas'd tho' so short was the Warning  To come to our Lodgings betimes in the Morning▪  He look'd very thoughtful and grave to be sure  And I said to myselfThere's no Hopes of a Cure  But I thought I should faint when I saw him dear Mother  Feel my Pulse with one Hand with a Watch in the other  No Token of Death that is heard in the Night  Could ever have put me so much in a Fright  Thinks I'tis all overmy Sentence is past  And now He is counting how long I may last  Then He look'd atand His Face grew so long  I'm sure He thought something within me was wrong  He determin'd our Cases at length Gd preserve us  I'm Bilious I find and the Women are Nervous  Their Systems relax'd and all turn'd topsyturvy  With Hypochondriacs Obstructions and Scurvy  And these are Distempers He must know the whole on  For He talk'd of the Peritoneum and Colon  Of Phleghmatic Humours oppressing the Women  From soeculent Matter that swells the Abdomen  But the Noise I have heard in my Bowels like Thunder  Is a Flatus I find in my left Hypochonder  So Plenty of Med'cines each Day does He send  Post singulas liquidas Sedes sumend'  Ad Crepitus Vesper Man promovend'  In English to say we must swallow a Potion  For driving out Wind after every Motion  The same to continue for Three Weeks at least  Before we may venture the Waters to taste  Five Times have I purg'dyet I'm sorry to tell ye  I find the same Gnawing and Wind in my Belly  But without any Doubt I shall find myself stronger  When I've took the same Physic a Week or two longer  He gives little TABBY a great many Doses  For he says the poor Creature has got the Chlorosis  Or a ravenous Pica so brought on the Vapours  By swallowing Stuff she has read in the Papers  And often I've marvel'd she spent so much Money  In WaterDock Essence and Balsam of Honey  Such Tinctures Elixirs such Pills have I seen  I never could wonder her Face was so green  Yet He thinks He can very soon set Her to right  With  Testic Equin  that she takes ev'ry Night  And when to her Spirits and Strength He has brought her  He thinks she may venture to bathe in the  Water    But PRUDENCE is forc'd ev'ry Day to ride out  For he says she wants thoroughly jumbling about  Now it happens in this very House is a Lodger  Whose Name's NICODEMUS but some call him ROGER  And ROGER's so good as my Sister to bump  On a Pillion as soon as she comes from the Pump  He's a pious good Man and an excellent Scholar  And I think it is certain no Harm can befall Her  For ROGER is constantly saying his Pray'rs  And singing of spiritual Hymns on the Stairs  But my Cousin Miss JENNY's as fresh as a Rose  And the Captain attends Her wherever she goes  The Captain's a  worthy good Sort of a Man  For He calls in upon us whenever He can  And often a Dinner or Supper He takes here  And JENNY and He talk of MILTON and SHAKESPEAR  For the Life of me now I can't think of his Name  But we all got acquainted as soon as we came  Don't wonder dear Mother in Verse I have writ  For JENNY declares I've a good pretty Wit  She says that she frequently sends a few Verses  To Friends and Acquaintance and often rehearses  Declares 'tis the Fashion and all the World knows  There's nothing so filthy so vulgar as Prose  And I hope as I write without any Connection  I shall make a great Figure in DODSLEY's Collection  At least when he chooses his Book to encrease  I may take a small Flight as a  fugitive Piece  But now my dear Mother I'm quite at a Stand  So I rest your most dutiful Son to Command  SIM BNRD  BATH    Miss JENNY WDR to Lady ELIZ MDSS at

PumpRoomcome away  J WDR  BATH    Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER IV  A Consultation of  PHYSICIANS  DEAR Mother my Time has been wretchedly spent  With a Gripe or a Hickup wherever I went  My Stomach all swell'd till I thought it would burst  Sure never poor Mortal with Wind was so curst  If ever I ate a good Supper at Night  I dream'd of the Devil and wak'd in a Fright  And so as I grew ev'ry Day worse and worse  The Doctor advis'd me to send for a Nurse  And the Nurse was so willing my Health to restore  She beg'd me to send for a few Doctors more  For when any difficult Work's to be done  Many Heads can dispatch it much sooner than one  And I find there are Doctors enough at this Place  If you want to consult in a dangerous Case  So they all met together and thus began talking  "Good Doctor I'm your's'tis a fine Day for walking  "Sad News in the PapersGd knows who's to blame  "The Colonies seem to be all in a Flame  "This StampAct no doubt might be good for the Crown  "But I sear 'tis a Pill that will never go down  "What can  Portugal  meanis  She  going to stir up  "Convulsions and Heats in the Bowels of  Europe  "'Twill be fatal if  England  relapses again  "From the ill Blood and Humours of  Bourbon  and  Spain  "  Says I my good Doctors I can't understand  Why the Deuce ye take so many Patients in Hand  Ye've a great deal of Practice as far as I find  But since ye're come hither do pray be so kind  To write me down something that's good for the Wind  No Doubt ye are all of ye great Politicians  But at present  my Bowels  have need of Physicians  Consider my Case in the Light it deserves  And pity the State of my Stomach and Nerves  But a tight little Doctor began a Dispute  About Administrations NEWLE and BE  Talk'd much of Oeconomy much of Prosuseness  Says another "This Case which at first was a Looseness  "Is become a Tenesmus and all we can do  "Is to give him a gentle Cathartic or two  "First get off the Phlegm that adheres to the  Plicae  "Then throw in a Med'cine that's pretty and spicy  "A Peppermint Draughtor aCome let's be gone  "We've another bad Case to consider at One"  So thus they brush'd off each his Cane at his Nose  When JENNY came in who had heard all their Prose  I'll teach them says she at their next Consultation  To come and take Fees for the Good of the Nation  I could not conceive what the Devil she mean't  But she seiz'd all the Stuff that the Doctor had sent  And out of the Window she flung it down souse  As the first Politician went out of the House  Decoctions and Syrups around him all flew  The Pill Bolus Julep and Apozem too  His Wig had the Luck a Cathartic to meet  And squash went the Gallipot under his Feet  She said 'twas a Shame I should swallow such Stuff  When my Bowels were weak and the Physic so rough  Declar'd she was shock'd that so many should come  To be Doctor'd to Death such a Distance from Home  At a Place where they tell you that Water alone  Can cure all Distempers that ever were known  But what is the pleasantest Part of the Story  She has order'd for Dinner a Piper and Dory  For toDay Captain CORMORANT's coming to dine  That worthy Acquaintance of JENNY's and mine  'Tis a Shame to the Army that Men of such Spirit  Should never obtain the Reward of their Merit  For the Captain's as gallant a Man I'll be sworn  And as honest a Fellow as ever was born  After so many Hardships and Dangers incurr'd  He Himself thinks He ought to be better preferr'd  And ROGER or what is his Name NICODEMUS  Appears full as kind and as much to esteem us  Our PRUDENCE declares he's an excellent Preacher  And by Night and by Day is so good as to teach her  His Doctrine so sound with such Spirit he gives  She ne'er can forget it as long as she lives  I told you before that He's often so kind  As to go out a riding with PRUDENCE behind  So frequently dines here without any pressing  And now to the Fish he is giving his Blessing  And as that is the Case tho' I've taken a Griper  I'll venture to peck at the Dory and Piper  And now my dear Mother c c c  S BNRD  BATH    Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER V  Salutations of  BATH  and an Adventure of Mr  BNRD  's in Consequence thereof  NO City dear Mother this City excels  For charming sweet Sounds both of Fiddles and Bells  I thought like a Fool that they only would ring  For a Wedding or Judge or the Birth of a King  But I found 'twas for  Me  that the goodnatur'd People  Rung so hard that I thought they would pull down the Steeple  So I took out my Purse as I hate to be shabby  And paid all the Men when they came from the Abbey  Yet some think it strange they should make such a Riot  In a Place where sick Folk would be glad to be quiet  But I hear 'tis the Business of this Corporation  To welcome in all the  Great  Men of the Nation  For you know there is nothing diverts or employs  The Minds of  Great  People like making a Noise  So with Bells they contrive all as much as they can  To tell the Arrival of any such Man  If a Broker or Statesman a Gamester or Peer  A nat'raliz'd Jew or a Bishop comes here  Or  an eminent Trader in Cheese  should retire  Just to think of the Bus'ness the State may require  With Horns and with Trumpets with Fiddles and Drums  They'll strive to divert him as soon as he comes  'Tis amazing they find such a Number of Ways  Of employing his Thoughts all the Time that he stays  If by chance the  Great  Man at his Lodging alone is  He may view from his Window the Colliers Ponies  On both the Parades where they tumble and kick  To the great Entertainment of those that are sick  What a Number of Turnspits and Builders he'll find  For relaxing his Cares and unbending his Mind  While Notes of sweet Music contend with the Cries  Of  fine potted Laver fresh Oysters  and  Pies  And Music's a Thing I shall truly revere  Since the CityMusicians so tickled my Ear  For when we arriv'd here at  Bath  t'other Day  They came to our Lodgings on Purpose to play  And I thought it was right as the Music was come  To foot it a little in TABITHA's Room  For Practice makes perfect as often I've read  And to Heels is of Service as well as the Head  But the Lodgers were shock'd such a Noise we should make  And the Ladies declar'd that we kept them awake  Lord RINGBONE who lay in the Parlour below  On Account of the Gout he had got in his Toe  Began on a sudden to curse and to swear  I protest my dear Mother 'twas shocking to hear  The Oaths of that reprobate gouty old Peer  "All the Devils in Hell sure at once have concurr'd  "To make such a Noise here as never was heard  "Some blundering Blockhead while I am in Bed  "Treads as hard as a CoachHorse just over my Head  "I cannot conceive what a Plague he's about  "Are the Fidlers come hither to make all this Rout  "With their dmn'd squeaking Catgut that's worse than the Gout  "If the Aldermen bad 'em come hither I swear  "I wish they were broiling in Hell with the May'r  "May Flames be my Portion if ever I give  "Those Rascals one Farthing as long as I live"  So while they were playing their musical Airs  And I was just dancing the Hay round the Chairs  He roar'd to his Frenchman to kick them down Stairs  The Frenchman came forth with his outlandish Lingo  Just the same as a Monkey and made all the Men go  I could not make out what he said not a Word  And his Lordship declar'd I was very absurd  Says I "Master RINGBONE I've nothing to fear  Tho' you be a Lord and your Man a Mounseer  For the May'r and the Aldermen bad them come here  'As absurd as I am  'I don't care a Damn  'For you nor your  Valee de Sham  'For a Lord do you see  'Is nothing to me  'Any more than a Flea  'And your Frenchman so eager  'With all his Soup Meagre  'Is no more than a Mouse  'Or a Bug or a Louse  'And I'll do as I please while I stay in the House  'For the BNRD Family all can afford  'To part with their Money as free as a Lord'  So I thank'd the Musicians and gave them a Guinea  Tho' the Ladies and Gentlemen call'd me a Ninny  And I'll give them another the next Time they play  For Men of good Fortune encourage they say  All Arts and all Sciences too in their Way  And the Men were so kind as to hallow and bawl  "Gd bless you Sir thank you good Fortune befall  Yourself and the BNRD Family all  Excuse any morefor I very well know  Both my Subject and Verse  is exceedingly low  But if any great Critic finds Fault with my Letter  He has nothing to do but to send you a better  And now my dear Mother c c c  S BNRD  BATH    Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER VI  IN WHICH Mr  BNRD  gives a Description of the  BATHING  THIS Morning dear Mother as soon as 'twas light  I was wak'd by a Noise that astonish'd me quite  For in TABITHA's Chamber I heard such a Clatter  I could not conceive what the Deuce was the Matter  And would you believe it I went up and found her  In a Blanket with two lusty Fellows around her  Who both seem'd a going to carry her off in  A little black Box just the Size of a Coffin  Pray tell me says I what ye're doing of there  "Why Master 'tis hard to be bilk'd of our Fare  "And so we were thrusting her into a Chair  "We don't see no Reason for using us so  "For she bad us come hither and now she won't go  "We're earn'd all the Fare for we both came and knock'd her  "Up as soon as 'twas light by Advice of the Doctor  "And this is a Job that we often go a'ter  "For Ladies that choose to go into the Water"  'But pray' says I 'TABITHA what is your Drift  'To be cover'd in Flannel instead of a Shift  ''Tis all by the Doctor's Advice I suppose  'That Nothing is left to be seen but your Nose  'I think if you really intend to go in  ''Twould do you more good if you stript to the Skin  'And if you've a Mind for a Frolick i'fa'th  'I'll just step and see you jump into the Bath'  So they hoisted her down just as safe and as well  And as snug as a Hod'mandod rides in his Shell  I fain would have gone to see TABITHA dip  But they turn'd at a Corner and gave me the Slip  Yet in searching about I had better Success  For I got to a Place where the Ladies undress  Thinks I to myself they are after some Fun  And I'll see what they're doing as sure as a Gun  So I peep'd at the Door and I saw a great Mat  That cover'd a Table and got under that  And laid myself down there as snug and as still  As a Body may say like a Thief in a Mill  And of all the fine Sights I have seen my dear Mother  I never expect to behold such another  How the Ladies did giggle and set up their Clacks  All the while an old Woman was rubbing their Backs  Oh 'twas pretty to see them all put on their Flannels  And then take the Water like so many Spaniels  And tho' all the while it grew hotter and hotter  They swam just as if they were hunting an Otter  'Twas a glorious Sight to behold the Fair Sex  All wading with Gentlemen up to their Necks  And view them so prettily tumble and sprawl  In a great smoaking Kettle as big as our Hall  And ToDay many Persons of Rank and Condition  Were boil'd by Command of an able Physician  Dean SPAVIN Dean MANGEY and Doctor DR'SQUIRT  Were all sent from  Cambridge  to rub off their Dirt  Judge SCRUB and the worthy old Counsellor PEST  Join'd Issue at once and went in with the rest  And this they all said was exceedingly good  For strength'ning the Spirits and mending the Blood  It pleas'd me to see how they all were inclin'd  To lengthen their Lives for the Good of Mankind  For I ne'er would believe that a Bishop or Judge  Can fancy old SATAN may owe him a Grudge  Tho' some think the Lawyer may choose to  Demur  And the Priest till another Occasion  Defer  And both to be better prepar'd for herea'ter  Take a Smack of the Brimstone contain'd in the Water  But what is surprising no Mortal e'er view'd  Any one of the Physical Gentlemen stew'd  Vide OLD BATH GUIDE  Since the Day that King BLADUD first found out the Bogs  And thought them so good for himself and his Hogs  Not one of the Faculty ever has try'd  These excellent Waters to cure his own Hide  Tho' many a skilful and learned Physician  With Candour good Sense and profound Erudition  Obliges the World with the Fruits of his Brain  Their Nature and hidden Effects to explain  Thus CHIRON advis'd Madam THETIS to take  And dip her poor Child in the  Stygian  Lake  But the worthy old Doctor was not such an Elf  As ever to venture his Carcase himself  So JASON's good Wife us'd to set on a Pot  And put in at once all the Patients she got  But thought it sufficient to give her Direction  Without being coddled to mend her Complexion  And I never have heard that she wrote any Treatise  To tell what the Virtue of Water and Heat is  You cannot conceive what a Number of Ladies  Were wash'd in the Water the same as our Maid is  Old  Baron  VANTEAZER a Man of great Wealth  Brought his Lady the  Baroness  here for her Health  The  Baroness  bathes and she says that her Case  Has been hit to a Hair and is mending apace  And this is a Point all the Learned agree on  The  Baron  has met with the Fate of ACTEON  Who while he peep'd into the Bath had the Luck  To find himself suddenly chang'd to a Buck  Miss SCRATCHIT went in and the  Countess  of SCALES  Both Ladies of very great Fashion in  Wales  Then all on a sudden two Persons of Worth  My Lady PANDORA MAC'SCURVEY came forth  With General SULPHUR arriv'd from the North  So TABBY you see had the Honour of Washing  With Folk of Distinction and very high Fashion  But in Spite of good Company poor little Soul  She shook both her Ears like a Mouse in a Bowl  Ods Bobs how delighted I was unawares  With the Fiddles I heard in the Room above Stairs  For Music is wholesome the Doctors all think  For Ladies that bathe and for Ladies that drink  And that's the Opinion of ROBIN our Driver  Who whistles his Nags while they stand at the River  They say it is right that for every Glass  A Tune you should take that the Water may pass  So while little TABBY was washing her Rump  The Ladies kept drinking it out of a Pump  I've a deal more to say but am loth to intrude  On your Time my dear Mother so now I'll conclude  S BNRD  BATH    Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER VII  A Panegyric on  BATH  and a  MORAVIAN HYMN  OF all the gay Places the World can afford  By Gentle and Simple for Pastime ador'd  Fine Balls and fine Concerts fine Buildings and Springs  Fine Walks and fine Views and a Thousand fine Things  Not to mention the sweet Situation and Air  What Place my dear Mother with  Bath  can compare  Let  Bristol  for Commerce and Dirt be renown'd  At  Sal'sbury  PenKnives and Scissars be ground  The Towns of  Devizes  of  Bradford  and  Frome  May boast that they better can manage the Loom  I believe that they maybut the World to refine  In Manners in Dress in Politeness to shine  O  Bath  let the Art let the Glory be thine  I'm sure I have travell'd our County all o'er  And ne'er was so civilly treated before  Would you think my dear Mother without the least Hint  That we all should be glad of appearing in Print  The NewsWriters here were so kind as to give all  The World an Account of our happy Arrival  You scarce can imagine what Numbers I've met  Tho' to me they are perfectly Strangers as yet  Who all with Address and Civility came  And seem'd vastly proud of SUBSCRIBING our Name  Young TIMOTHY CANVASS is charm'd with the Place  Who I hear is come hither his Fibres to brace  Poor Man at th'Election he threw t'other Day  All his Victuals and

Mr  BNRD  goes to the  Rooms  His Opinion of  Gaming  FROM the earliest Ages dear Mother till now  All Statesmen and great Politicians allow  That nothing advances the Good of a Nation  Like giving all Money a free Circulation  This Question from Members of Parliament draws  Many Speeches that meet universal Applause  And if ever dear Mother I live to be one  I'll speak on this Subject as sure as a Gun  For  Bath  will I speak and I'll make an Oration  Shall obtain me the Freedom of this Corporation  I have no Kind of Doubt but the Speaker will beg  All the Members to  Hear  when I set out my Leg  "Circulation of CashCirculation decay'd  "Is at once the Destruction and Ruin of Trade  "CirculationI sayCirculation it is  "Gives Life to Commercial Countries like this  What Thanks to the City of  Bath  then are due  From all who this Patriot Maxim pursue  For in no Place whatever that National Good  Is practis'd so well and so well understood  What infinite Merit and Praise does she claim in  Her Ways and her Means for promoting of  Gaming  And  Gaming  no doubt is of infinite use  That same Circulation of Cash to produce  What true publicspirited People are here  Who for that very Purpose come every Year  All Eminent Men who no Trade ever knew  But  Gaming  the only good Trade to pursue  All other Professions are subject to fail  But  Gaming  's a Bus'ness will ever prevail  Besides 'tis the only good Way to commence  An Acquaintance with all Men of Spirit and Sense  We may grub on without it thro' Life I suppose  But then 'tis with People  that Nobody knows  We ne'er can expect to be rich wise or great  Or look'd upon fit for Employments of State  'Tis your Men of fine Heads and of nice Calculations  That afford so much Service to Administrations  Who by frequent Experience know how to devize  The speediest Methods of raising Supplies  'Tis such Men as these Men of Honour and Worth  That challenge Respect from all Persons of Birth  And is it not right they should all be carest  When they're all so polite and so very well drest  When they circulate freely the Money they've won  And wear a lac'd Coat tho' their Fathers wore none  Our Trade is encourag'd as much if not more  By the tender soft Sex I shall ever adore  But their Husbands those Brutes have been known to complain  And swear they will never set Foot here again  Ye Wretches ingrate to find Fault with your Wives  The Comfort the Solace and Joy of your Lives  Don't SOLOMON speak of such Women with Rapture  In Verse his Eleventh and thirtyfirst Chapter  He says "If you find out a virtuous Wife  "She will do a Man good all the Days of her Life  "She deals like a Merchant she sitteth up late"  And you'll find it is written in Verse TwentyEight  "Her Husband is sure to be known at the Gate  "He never hath Need or Occasion for Spoil  "When his Wife is much better employ'd all the while  "She seeketh fine Wool and fine Linen she buys  "And is clothed in Purple and Scarlet likewise"  Now pray don't your Wives do the very same thing  And follow th' Advice of this worthy old King  Do they spare for Expences themselves in adorning  Don't they go about buying fine Things all the Morning  And at Cards all the Night take the Trouble to play  To get back the Money they spent in the Day  And sure there's no Sort of Occasion to shew  Ye are known at the Gate or wherever ye go  Pray are not your Ladies at  Bath  better plac'd  Than the Wife of a King who herself so disgrac'd  And at  Ithaca  liv'd in  such very bad Taste  Poor Soul while her husband thought proper to leave her  She slav'd all the Day like a Spitalfields Weaver  And then like a Fool when her Web was half spun  Pull'd topieces at Night all the Work she had done  But these to their Husbands more Profit can yield  And are much like a Lilly that grows in the Field  They toil not indeed nor indeed do they spin  Yet they never are idle when once they begin  But are very intent on encreasing their Store  And always keep shuffling and cutting for more  Industrious Creatures that make it a Rule  To secure half the Fish while they  manage  the Pool  So they win to be sure yet I very much wonder  Why they put so much Money the Candlestick under  For up comes a Man on a sudden Slapdash  Snuffs the Candles and carries away all the Cash  And as Nobody troubles their Heads any more  I'm in very great Hopes that it goes to the Poor  Methinks I should like to excel in a Trade  By which such a Number their Fortunes have made  I've heard of a wise philosophical Jew  That shuffles the Cards in a Manner that's new  One JONAS I thinkAnd cou'd wish for the future  To have that illustrious Sage for my Tutor  And the Captain whose Kindness I ne'er can forget  Will teach me a Game that he

find  Are fond of attracting the Eyes of Mankind  What Numbers one sees who for that very Reason  Come to make such a Figure at  Bath  ev'ry Season  'Tis This that provokes Mrs SHENKIN APLEEK  To dine at the Ord'nary twice in a Week  Tho' at Home she might eat a good Dinner in Comfort  Nor pay such a cursed extravagant Sum for't  But then her Acquaintance would never have known  Mrs SHENKIN APLEEK had acquir'd a  Bon Ton  Ne'er shewn how in  Taste  the APLEEKS can excel  The Dutchess of TRUFFLES and Lady MORELL  Had ne'er been ador'd by Sir PYE MACARONI  And Count VERMICELLI his intimate Crony  Both Men of such  Taste  their Opinions are taken  From an Ortolan down to a Rusher of Bacon  What makes KITTY SPICE  and little Miss SAGO  To Auctions and Milliners Shops ev'ry Day go  What makes them to vie with each other and quarrel  Which spends the most Money for splendid Apparel  Why  Spirit  to shew they have much better Sense  Than their Fathers who rais'd it by Shillings and Pence  What sends PETER TEWKSBURY every Night  To the Play with such infinite Joy and Delight  Why PETER's a Critic with true Attic Salt  Can damn the Performers can hiss and find fault  And tell when we ought to express Approbation  By thumping and clapping and Vociferation  So he gains our Attention and all must admire  Young TEWKSBURY's Judgment his  Spirit  and Fire  But JACK DILETTANTE despises the Play'rs  To Concerts and musical Parties repairs  With BenefitTickets his Pockets he fills  Like a Mountebank Doctor distributes his Bills  And thus his Importance and Interest shews  By conserring his Favours wherever He goes  He's extremely polite both to me and my Couzen  For he often desires us to take off a Dozen  He has Taste without doubt and a delicate Ear  No vile Oratorios ever could bear  But talks of the Op'ras and his Signiora  Cries  Bravo Benissimo Bravo Encora  And oft is so kind as to thrust in a Note  While old Lady CUCKOW is straining her Throat  Or little Miss WREN who's an excellent Singer  Then he points to the Notes with a Ring on his Finger  And shews Her the Crotchet the Quaver and Bar  All the Time that she warbles and plays the  Guitar  Yet I think tho' she's at it from Morning till Noon  Her queer little Thingumbob's never in Tune  Thank Heaven of late my dear Mother my Face is  Not a little regarded at all public Places  For I ride in a Chair with my Hands in a Muff  And have bought a Silk Coat and embroidered the Cuff  But the Weather was cold and the Coat it was thin  So the Taylor advis'd me to line it with Skin  But what with my  Nivernois'  Hat can compare  BagWig and lac'd Ruffles and black Solitair  And what can a Man of true Fashion denote  Like an Ell of good Ribbon ty'd under the Throat  My Buckles and Box are in exquisite Taste  The one is of Paper the other of Paste  And sure no  Camayeu  was ever yet seen  Like that which I purchas'd at WICKSTED's Machine  My Stockings of Silk are just come from the Hosier  For Tonight I'm to dance with the charming Miss TOZIER  So I'd have them to know when I go to the Ball  I shall shew as much  Taste  as the best of them all  For a Man of great Fashion was heard to declare  He never beheld so engaging an Air  And swears all the World must my Judgment confess  My  Solidity Sense Understanding  in Dress  My Manners so form'd and my Wig so well curl'd  I look like a Man  of the very first World  But my Person and Figure you'll best understand  From the Picture I've sent by an eminent Hand  Shew it young Lady BETTY by Way of Endearance  And to give her a Spice

LETTER XI  A Description of the  BALL  with an Episode on  BEAU NASH  WHAT Joy at the Ball what Delight have I found  By all the bright Circle encompass'd around  Each Moment with Transport my Bosom felt warm  For what my dear Mother like Beauty can charm  The Remembrance alone while their Praise I rehearse  Gives Life to my Numbers and Strength to my Verse  Then allow for the Rapture the Muses inspire  Such Themes call aloud for Poetical Fire  I've read how the Goddesses meet all above  And throng the immortal Assemblies of JOVE  When join'd with the Graces fair VENUS appears  Ambrosial sweet Odours perfume all the Spheres  But the Goddess of Love and the Graces and all  Must yield to the Beauties I've seen at the Ball  For JOVE never felt such a Joy at his Heart  Such a Heat as these charming sweet Creatures impart  In shortthere is something in very fine Women  When they meet all together that's quite overcoming  Then say O ye Nymphs that inhabit the Shades  Of  Pindus'  sweet Banks  Heliconian  Maids  Celestial Muses ye Powers divine  O say for your Memory's better than mine  What Troops of fair Virgins assembled around  What Squadrons of Heroes for Dancing renown'd  Were rouz'd by the Fiddle's harmonious Sound  What Goddess shall first be the Theme of my Song  Whose Name the clear AVON may murmur along  And Echo repeat all the Vallies among  Lady TETTATON's Sister Miss FUBBY FATARMIN  Was the first that presented her Person so charming  Than whom more engaging more beautiful none  A Goddess herself among Goddesses shone  Excepting the lovely Miss TOWZER alone  'Tis she that has long been the Toast of the Town  Tho' all the World knows her Complexion is brown  If some People think that her Mouth be too wide  Miss TOWZER has numberless Beauties beside  A Countenance noble with sweet pouting Lips  And a delicate Shape from her Waist to her Hips  Besides a prodigious rough black Head of Hair  That is frizzled and curl'd o'er her Neck that is bare  I've seen the sweet Creature but once I confess  But her Air and her Manner and pleasing Address  All made me feel something I ne'er can express  But lo on a sudden what Multitudes pour  From  Cambrian  Mountains from  Indian  Shore  Bright Maidens bright Widows and fortunate Swains  Who cultivate LIFFY's sweet Borders and Plains  And they who their Flocks in fair ALBION seed  Rich Flocks and rich Herds so the Gods have decreed  Since they quitted the pleasanter Banks of the  Tweed  Yet here no Confusion no Tumult is known  Fair Order and Beauty establish their Throne  For Order and Beauty and just Regulation  Support all the Works of this ample Creation  For This in Compassion to Mortals below  The Gods their peculiar Favour to shew  Sent HERMES to  Bath  in the Shape of a BEAU  That Grandson of ATLAS came down from above  To bless all the Regions of Pleasure and Love  To lead the fair Nymph thro' the various Maze  Bright Beauty to marshal his Glory and Praise  To govern improve and adorn the gay Scene  By the Graces instructed and  Cyprian  Queen  As when in a Garden delightful and gay  Where FLORA is wont all her Charms to display  The sweet Hyacinthus with Pleasure we view  Contend with Narcissus in delicate Hue  The Gard'ner industrious trims out his Border  Puts each odoriferous Plant in it's Order  The Myrtle he ranges the Rose and the Lilly  With Iris and Crocus and Daffadowndilly  Sweet Peas and sweet Oranges all He disposes  At once to regale both your Eyes and your Noses  Long reign'd the great NASH this omnipotent Lord  Respected by Youth and by Parents ador'd  For him not enough at a Ball to preside  Th' unwary and beautiful Nymph would he guide  Oft tell her a Tale how the credulous Maid  By Man by perfidious Man is betray'd  Taught Charity's Hand to relieve the distrest  With tender Compassion his Tears have exprest  But alas He is gone and the City can tell  How in Years and in Glory lamented he sell  Him mourn'd all the Dryads on CLAVERTON's Mount  Him AVON deplor'd Him the Nymph of the Fount  The Crystalline Streams  Then perish his Picture his Statue decay  A Tribute more lasting the Muses shall pay  If true what Philosophers all will assure us  Who dissent from the Doctrine of great EPICURUS  That the Spirit's immortal as Poets allow  If Life's Occupations are follow'd below  In Reward of his Labours his Virtue and Pains  He is footing it now in th' Elysian Plains  Indulg'd as a Token of PROSERPINE's Favour  To preside at her Balls in a creamcolour'd Beaver  Then Peace to his AshesOur Grief be supprest  Since we find such a Phoenix has sprung from his Nest  Kind Heaven has sent us another Professor  Who follows the Steps of his great Predecessor  But hark now they strike the melodious String  The vaulted Roof echoes the Mansions all ring  At the Sound of the Hautboy the Bass and the Fiddle  Sir BOREAS BLUBBER steps forth in the Middle  Like a HolyHock noble majestic and tall  Sir BOREAS BLUBBER first opens the Ball  Sir BOREAS great in the Minuet known  Since the Day that for Dancing his Talents were shewn  Where the Science is practis'd by Gentlemen grown  For in every Science in ev'ry Profession  We make the best Progress at Years of Discretion  How he puts on his Hat with a Smile on his Face  And delivers his Hand with an exquisite Grace  How genteelly he offers Miss CARROT before us  Miss CARROT EITZOOZER a Niece of Lord PORUS  How nimbly he paces how active and light  One never can judge of a Man at first Sight  But as near as I guess from the Size of his Calf  He may weigh about twentythree Stone and a Half  Now why should I mention a Hundred or more  Who went the same Circle as others before  To a Tune that they play'd us a hundred Times o'er  See little BOB JEROM old CHRYSOSTOM's Son  With a Chitterlin Shirt and a Buckle of Stone  What a cropt Head of Hair the young Parson has on  Emerg'd from his Grizzle th'unfortunate Sprig  Seems as if he was hunting all Night for his Wig  Not perfectly pleas'd with the Coat on his Back  Tho' the Coat's a good Coat but alas it is black  With envious Eyes he is doom'd to behold  The Captain's red Suit that's embroider'd with Gold  How seldom Mankind is content with their Lot  BOB JEROM two very good Livings has got  Yet still he accuses his Parents deceas'd  For making a Man of such Spirit a Priest  Not so Master MARMOZET sweet little Boy  Mrs DANGLECUB's Hopes her Delight and her Joy  His pidgeonwing'd Head was not drest quite so soon  For it took up a Barber the whole Afternoon  His Jacket's well lac'd and the Ladies protest  Master MARMOZET dances as well as the best  Yet some think the Boy would be better at School  But I hear Mrs DANGLECUB's not such a Fool  To send a poor Thing with a Spirit so meek  To be flog'd by a Tyrant for Latin and Greek  She wonders that Parents to  Eton  should send  Five Hundred great Boobies their Manners to mend  She says that her Son will his Fortune advance  By learning so early to fiddle and dance  So she brings him to  Bath  which I think is quite right  For they do nothing else here from Morning till Night  And this is a Lesson all Parents should know  To train up a Child in the Way he should go  For as SOLOMON says you may safely uphold  He ne'er will depart from the same when he's old  No doubt she's a Woman of fine Understanding  Her Air and her Presence there's something so grand in  So wise and discreet and to give Her her Due  Dear Mother she's just such a Woman as you  But who is that Bombazine Lady so gay  So profuse of her Beauties in sable Array  How she rests on her Heel how she turns out her Toe  How she pulls down her Stays with her Head up to shew  Her Lillywhite Bosom that rivals the Snow  'Tis the Widow QUICKLACKIT whose Husband last Week  Poor STEPHEN went suddenly forth in a Pique  And push'd off his Boat for the  Stygian  Creek  Poor STEPHEN he never return'd from the Bourn  But left the disconsolate Widow to mourn  Three Times did she faint when she heard of the News  Six Days did she weep and all Comfort refuse  But STEPHEN no Sorrow no Tears can recall  So she hallows the Seventh and comes to the Ball  For Music sweet Music has Charms to controul  And tune up each Passion that ruffles the Soul  What things have I read and what Stories been told  Of Feats that were done by Musicians of old  I saw t'other Day in a  Thing call'd an Ode  As it lay in a snug little House on the Road  How SAUL was restor'd tho' his Sorrow was sharp  When DAVID the  Bethlemite  play'd on the Harp  'Twas Music that brought a Man's Wife from  Old Nick  And at  Bath  has the Pow'r to recover the Sick  Thus a Lady was cur'd t'other Day  But 'tis Time  To seal up my Letter and finish my Rhyme  S BNRD  BATH    Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER XII  A  Modern HEADDRESS  with a little  POLITE CONVERSATION  WHAT base and unjust Accusations we find  Arise from the Malice and Spleen of Mankind  One would hope my dear Mother that Scandal would spare  The tender the helpless and delicate Fair  But alas the sweet Creatures all find it the Case  That  Bath  is a very censorious Place  Would you think that a Person I met since I came  I hope you'll excuse my concealing his Name  A splenetic illnatur'd Fellow before  A Room full of very good Company swore  That in spight of Appearance 'twas very well known  Their Hair and their Faces were none of their own  And thus without Wit or the least Provocation  Began an impertinent formal Oration  "Shall Nature thus lavish her Beauties in vain  "For Art and nonsensical Fashion to stain  "The fair JEZEBELLA what Art can adorn  "Whose Cheeks are like Roses that blush in the Morn  "As bright were her Locks as in Heaven are seen  "Presented for Stars by th'  Egyptian  Queen  "But alas the sweet Nymph they no longer must deck  "No more shall they flow o'er her Ivory Neck  "Some Runaway Valet some outlandish Shaver  "Has spoil'd all the Honours that Nature has gave her  "Her Head has he robb'd with as little Remorse  "As a FoxHunter crops both his Dogs and his Horse  "A Wretch that so far from repenting his Theft  "Makes a Boast of tormenting the little that's left  "And first at her Porcupine Head he begins  "To fumble and poke with his Irons and Pins  "Then fires all his Crackers with horrid Grimace  "And puffs his vile  Rocambol  Breath in her Face  "Discharging a Steam that the Devil would choak  "From Paper Pomatum from Powder and Smoke  "The Patient submits and with due Resignation  "Prepares for her Fate in the next Operation  "When lo on a sudden a Monster appears  "A horrible Monster to cover her Ears  "What Sign of the Zodiac is it he bears  "Is it  Taurus's Tail  or the  Tete de Mouton  "Or the  Beard of the Goat  that he dares to put on  "'Tis a Wig  en Vergette  that from  Paris  was brought  "Un  Tete comme il faut  that the Varlet has bought  "Of a Beggar whose Head he has shav'd for a Groat  "Now fix'd to her Head does he frizzle and dab it  "Her Foretop's no more'Tis the Skin of a Rabbit  "'Tis a Muff'tis a Thing that by all is confest  "Is in Colour and Shape like a Chalfinch's Nest  "O cease ye fair Virgins such Pains to employ  "The Beauties of Nature with Paint to destroy  "See VENUS lament see the Loves and the Graces  "How they pine at the Injury done to your Faces  "Ye have Eyes Lips and Nose but your Heads are no more  "Than a Doll's that is plac'd at a Milliner's Door"  I'm asham'd to repeat what he said in the Sequel  Aspersions so cruel as nothing can equal  I declare I am shock'd such a Fellow should vex  And spread all these Lyes of the innocent Sex  For whom while I live I will make Protestation  I've the highest Esteem and profound Veneration  I never so strange an Opinion will harbour  That they buy all the Hair they have got of a Barber  Nor ever believe that such beautiful Creatures  Can have any Delight in abusing their Features  One Thing tho' I wonder at much I confess is  Th'Appearance they make in their different Dresses  For indeed they look very much like Apparitions  When they come in the Morning to hear the Musicians  And some I am apt to mistake at first Sight  For the Mothers of those I have seen over Night  It shocks me to see them look paler than Ashes  And as dead in the Eye as the Busto of NASH is  Who the Ev'ning before were so blooming and plump  I'm griev'd to the Heart when I go to the Pump  For I take ev'ry Morning a Sup at the Water  Just to hear what is passing and see what they're a'ter  For I'm told the Discourses of Persons refin'd  Are better than Books for improving the Mind  But a great deal of Judgment's requir'd in the skimming  The polite Conversation of sensible Women  For they come to the Pump as before I was saying  And talk all at once while the Music is playing  "Your Servant Miss FITCHET" "good Morning Miss STOTE  "My dear Lady RIGGLEDUM how is your Throat  "Your Ladyship knows that I sent you a Scrawl  "Last Night to attend at your Ladyship's Call  "But I hear that your Ladyship went to the Ball"  "Oh FITCHETdon't ask megood Heavens preserve  "I wish there was no such a Thing as a Nerve  "Half dead all the Night I protest and declare  "My dear little FITCHET who dresses your Hair  "You'll come to the Rooms all the World will be there  "Sir TOBY MAC'NEGUS is going to settle  "His Teadrinking Night with Sir PHILIP O'KETTLE"  "I hear that they both have appointed the same  "The Majority think that Sir PHILIP's to blame  "I hope they won't quarrel they're both in a Flame  "Sir TOBY MAC'NEGUS much Spirit has got  "And Sir PHILIP O'KETTLE is apt to be hot"  "Have you read the  Bath Guide  that ridiculous Poem  "What a scurrilous Author does nobody know him"  "Young BILLY PENWAGGLE and SIMIUS CHATTER  "Declare 'tis an illnatur'd halfwitted Satire"  "You know I'm engag'd my dear Creature with you  "And Mrs PAMTICKLE this Morning at Loo  "Poor Thing though she hobbled last Night to the Ball  "ToDay she's so lame that she hardly can crawl  "Major LIGNUM has trod on the first Joint of her Toe  "That Thing they play'd last was a charming Concerto  "I don't recollect I have heard it before  "The Minuet's good but the Jig I adore  "Pray speak to Sir TOBY to cry out  Encore  "  Dear Mother I think this is excellent Fun  But if all I must write I should never have done  So myself I subscribe your most dutiful Son  S BNRD  BATH    Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER XIII A PUBLIC BREAKFAST  WHAT Blessings attend my

splendid Assembly the plentiful Board  To thee do I owe such a Breakfast this Morn  As I nee'r saw before since the Hour I was born  'Twas You made my Lord RAGGAMUFFENN come here  Who they say has been lately created a Peer  And Today with extreme Complaisance and Respect ask'd  All the People at  Bath  to a general Breakfast  You've heard of my Lady BUNBUTTER no doubt  How she loves an  Assembly Fandango  or  Rout  No Lady in  London  is half so expert  At a snug private Party her Friends to divert  But they say that of late she's grown sick of the Town  And often to  Bath  condescends to come down  Her Ladyship's favourite House is the  Bear  Her Chariot and Servants and Horses are there  My Lady declares that  Retiring  is good  As all with a separate Maintenance should  For when you have put out the conjugal Fire  'Tis Time for all sensible Folk to retire  If HYMEN no longer his Fingers will scorch  Little CUPID for others can whip in his Torch  So pert is he grown since the Custom began  To be married and parted as quick as you can  Now my Lord had the Honour of coming down Post  To pay his Respects to so famous a Toast  In Hopes He her Ladyship's Favour might win  By playing the Part of a Host at an Inn  I'm sure He's a Person of great Resolution  Tho' delicate Nerves and a weak Constitution  For he carried us all to a Place cross the River  And vow'd that the Rooms were too hot for his Liver  He said it would greatly our Pleasure promote  If we all for  SpringGardens  set out in a Boat  I never as yet could his Reason explain  Why we all sallied sorth in the Wind and the Rain  For sure such Confusion was never yet known  Here a Cap and a Hat there a Cardinal blown  While his Lordship embroider'd and powder'd all o'er  Was bowing and handing the Ladies ashore  How the Misses did huddle and scuddle and run  One would think to be wet must be very good Fun  For by waggling their Tails they all seem'd to take Pains  To moisten their Pinions like Ducks when it rains  And 'twas pretty to see how like Birds of a Feather  The People of Quality flock'd all together  All pressing addressing caressing and fond  Just the same as those Animals are in a Pond  You've read all their Names in the News I suppose  But for fear you have not take the List as it goes  There was Lady GREASEWRISTER  And Madam VANTWISTER  Her Ladyship's Sister  Lord CRAM and Lord VULTUR  Sir BRANDISH O' CULTER  With Marshal CAROUZER  And old Lady MOWZER  And the great  Hanoverian  Baron PANSMOWZER  Besides many others who all in the Rain went  On purpose to honour this grand Entertainment  The Company made a most brilliant Appearance  And ate Bread and Butter with great Perseverance  All the Chocolate too that my Lord set before 'em  The Ladies dispatch'd with the utmost Decorum  Soft musical Numbers were heard all around  The Horns and the Clarions echoing sound  Sweet were the Strains as od'rous Gales that blow  O'er fragrant Banks where Pinks and Roses grow  The Peer was quite ravish'd while close to his Side  Sat Lady BUNBUTTER in beautiful Pride  Oft turning his Eyes he with Rapture survey'd  All the powerful Charms she so nobly display'd  As when at the Feast of the great ALEXANDER  TIMOTHEUS the musical Son of THERSANDER  Breath'd heavenly Measures  The Prince was in Pain  And could not contain  While THAIS was sitting beside him  But before all his Peers  Was for shaking the Spheres  Such Goods all the Gods did provide Him  Grew bolder and bolder  And cock'd up his Shoulder  Like the Son of great JUPITER AMMON  Till at length quite opprest  He sunk on her Breast  And lay there as dead as a Salmon  O had I a Voice that was stronger than Steel  With twice Fifty Tongues to express what I feel  And as many good Mouths yet I never could utter  All the Speeches my Lord made to Lady BUNBUTTER  So polite all the Time that he ne'er touch'd a Bit  While she ate up his Rolls and applauded his Wit  For they tell me that Men of  true Taste  when they treat  Must talk a great deal but they never should eat  And if that be the Fashion I never will give  Any grand Entertainment as long as I live  For I'm of Opinion 'tis proper to chear  The Stomach and Bowels as well as the Ear  Nor me did the charming Concerto of ABEL  Regale like the Breakfast I saw on the Table  I freely will own I the Muffins preferr'd  To all the genteel Conversation I heard  E'en tho' I'd the Honour of sitting between  My Lady STUFFDAMASK and PEGGY MOREEN  Who both flew to  Bath  in the  London  Machine  Cries PEGGY "This Place is enchantingly pretty  "We never can see such a Thing in the City  "You may spend all your LifeTime in  Cateaton  Street  "And never so civil a Gentleman meet  "You may talk what you please you may search  London  thro'  "You may go to  Carlisle  's and to  Almanac  's too  "And I'll give you my Head if you find such a Host  "For Coffee Tea Chocolate Butter and Toast  "How He welcomes at once all the World and his Wife  "And how civil to Folk he ne'er saw in his Life"  "These Horns cries my Lady so tickle one's Ear  "Lard what would I give that Sir SIMON was here  "To the next Public Breakfast Sir SIMON shall go  "For I find here are Folks one may venture to know  "Sir SIMON would gladly his Lordship attend  "And my Lord would be pleas'd with so chearful a Friend"  So when we had wasted more Bread at a Breakfast  Than the poor of our Parish have ate for this Week past  I saw all at once a prodigious great Throng  Come bustling and rustling and jostling along  For his Lordship was pleas'd that the Company now  To my Lady BUNBUTTER should curt'sey and bow  And my Lady was pleas'd too and seem'd vastly proud  At once to receive all the Thanks of a Crowd  And when like  Chaldeans  we all had ador'd  This beautiful Image set up by my Lord  Some few insignificant Folk went away  Just to follow th'Employments and Calls of the Day  But those who knew better their Time how to spend  The Fiddling and Dancing all chose to attend  Miss CLUNCH and Sir TOBY perform'd a  Cotillon  Much the same as our SUSAN and BOB the Postilion  All the while her Mamma was expressing her Joy  That her Daughter the Morning so well could employ  Now why should the Muse my dear Mother relate  The Misfortunes that fall to the Lot of the Great  As Homeward we came'tis with Sorrow you'll hear  What a dreadful Disaster attended the Peer  For whether some envious God had decreed  That a  Naid  should long to ennoble her Breed  Or whether his Lordship was charm'd to behold  His Face in the Stream like NARCISSUS of old  In handing old Lady BUMFIDGET and Daughter  This obsequious Lord tumbled into the Water  Some Nymph of the Flood brought him safe to the Boat  And I left all the Ladies a' cleaning his Coat  Thus the Feast was concluded as far as I hear  To the great Satisfaction of all that were there  O may he give Breakfast as long as he stays  For I ne'er ate a better in all my born Days  In Haste I conclude  c c c  S BNRD  BATH    Miss PRUDENCE BRD to Lady ELIZ MDSS at Castle North  LETTER XIV IN WHICH  Miss  PRUDENCE BRD  informs Lady  BETTY  that She has been elected to  METHODISM  by a  VISION  HEARKEN Lady BETTY hearken  To the dismal News I tell  How your Friends are all embarking  For the fiery Gulph of Hell  Brother SIMKIN's grown a Rakehell  Cards and dances ev'ry Day  JENNY laughs at Tabernacle  TABBY RUNT is gone astray  Blessed I tho' once rejected  Like a little wand'ring Sheep  Who this Morning was elected  By a Vision in my Sleep  For I dream'd an Apparition  Came like ROGER from Above  Saying by Divine Commission  I must fill you full of Love  Just with ROGER's Head of Hair on  ROGER's Mouth and pious Smile  Sweet methinks as Beard of AARON  Dropping down with holy Oil  I began to fall a kicking  Panted struggl'd strove in vain  When the Spirit whipt so quick in  I was cur'd of all my Pain  First I thought it was the NightMare  Lay so heavy on my Breast  But I found new Joy and Light there  When with Heav'nly Love possest  Come again then Apparition  Finish what thou hast begun  ROGER stay Thou Soul's Physician  I with thee my Race will run  Faith her Chariot has appointed  Now we're stretching for the Goal  All the Wheels with Grace anointed  Up to Heav'n to drive my Soul  The Editor for many Reasons begs to be excused giving the Public the Sequel of this young Lady's Letter but it the Reader will please to look into the Bishop of  Exeter  's Book entitled  The Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists compared  He will find many Instances particularly of young People who have been elected in the Manner above  Mr S BNRD to Lady BNRD at Hall North  LETTER XV Serious REFLECTIONS  of Mr  BRD  His  BILL of EXPENCES  A  Farewell  to  BATH  ALAS my dear Mother our Evil and Good  By few is distinguish'd by few understood  How oft are we doom'd to repent at the End  The Events that our pleasantest Prospects attend  As SOLON declar'd in the last Scene alone  All the Joys of our Life all our Sorrows are known  When first I came hither for Vapours and Wind  To cure all Distempers and study Mankind  How little I dream'd of the Tempest behind  I never once thought what a furious Blast  What Storms of Distress would o'erwhelm me at last  How wretched am I what a fine Declamation  Might be made on the Subject of my Situation  I'm a Fable an Instance and serve to dispense  An Example to all Men of Spirit and Sense  To all Men of Fashion and all Men of Wealth  Who come to this place to recover their Health  For my Means are so small and my Bills are so large  I ne'er can come home till you send a Discharge  Let the Muse speak the Cause if a Muse yet remain  To supply me with Rhimes and express all my Pain  Paid Bells and Musicians  Drugs Nurse and Physicians  Balls Raffles Subscriptions and Chairs  Wigs Gowns Skins and Trimming  Good Books for the Women  Plays Concerts Tea Negus and Prayers  Paid the following Schemes  Of all who it seems  Make Charity Business their Care  A Gamester decay'd  And a prudish old Maid  By Gaiety brought to Despair  A Fidler of Note  Who for Lace on his Coat  To his Taylor was much in Arrears  An Author of Merit  Who wrote with such Spirit  The Pillory took off his Ears  A Sum my dear Mother far heavier yet  Captain CORMORANT won when I learn'd Lansquenet  Two Hundred I paid him and Five am in Debt  For the Five I had nothing to do but to  write  For the Captain was very well bred and polite  And took as he saw my Expences were great  My Bond to be paid on the  Clodpole  Estate  And asks nothing more while the Money is lent  Than Interest paid him at Twenty per Cent  But I'm shock'd to relate what Distresses befall  Miss JENNY my Sister and TABBY and all  Miss JENNY poor Thing from this  Bath  Expedition  Was in Hopes very soon to have chang'd her Condition  But Rumour has brought certain Things to her Ear  Which I ne'er will believe yet am sorry to hear  "That the Captain her Lover her dear ROMEÔ  Was Banish'd the Army a great while ago  That his Friends and his Foes He alike can betray  And picks up a scandalous Living by Play"  But if e'er I could think that the Captain had cheated  Or my dear Cousin JENNY unworthily treated  By all that is sacred I swear for his Pains  I'd cudgel him first and then blow out his Brains  For the Man I abhor like the Devil dear Mother  Who one Thing conceals and professes another  O how shall we know the right Way to pursue  Do the Ills of Mankind from Religion accrue  Religion design'd to relieve all our Care  Has brought my poor Sister to Grief and Despair  Now she talks of Damnation and screws up her face  Then prates about ROGER and spiritual Grace  Her senses alas seem at once gone astray  No Pen can describe it no Letter convey  But the  Man without Sin  that  Moravian  Rabbi  Has perfectly cur'd the  Chlorosis  of TABBY  And if right I can judge from her Shape and her Face  She soon may produce him an Infant of Grace  Now they say that all People in our Situation  Are very fine subjects for Regeneration  But I think my dear Mother the best we can do  Is to pack up our All and return back to you  Farewell then ye Streams  Ye poetical Themes  Sweet Fountains for curing the Spleen  I'm griev'd to the Heart  Without Cash to depart  And quit this adorable Scene  Where Gaming and Grace  Each other embrace  Dissipation and Piety meet  May all who've a Notion  Of Cards or Devotion  Make  Bath  their delightful Retreat  S BD  FINIS
