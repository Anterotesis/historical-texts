 GLEANINGS IN ENGLAND  GLEANINGS IN ENGLAND DESCRIPTIVE OF THE COUNTENANCE MIND AND CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY  BY MR PRATT  I GLORY IN THE NAME OF BRITON  VOL IV  LONDON  PRINTED BY H BALDWIN AND SON FOR T N LONGMAN AND O REES PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCXCIX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE  first Letter and the last of this Volume furnish so much of what is usually considered to be necessary matter in an address to the Reader and so fully explain the Author's aim and endof both which he trusts the intermediate parts will not unimpressively supply the accomplishmentthat not much is left in the way of advertisement to be added  The Author's grand view has been what indeed will be but repetition to state here though that part of the plan cannot be too soon knownto present a  just and honourable IDEA of this important Country  as a whole from not a mechanical not a methodicalbut fair and liberal survey of its parts taken in several journies upon its animated surface with  descriptions  from immediate objects and  REFLECTIONS  moral natural political or personal either in connection with or arising out of them And the  motive  which suggested this planbesides a compliance with the wishes of an amiable  Foreigner  who in a perusal of many contradictory accounts was still at fault how to settle our pretensions in any of the abovementioned particularswas and is a most ardent desire to promote  domestic  peace and union If the plan were executed but half as well as the sentiment that gave it birth is sincere and commendable the content of the Author's heart which has been glowing even in the  attempt  would indeed be absolute At any rate there never has been most likely there never shall bea crisis in the history of Great Britain or of the Universe when such an attempt can more favourably be made in point of  time  than at the moment in which with a throbbing heart he is now about to present it to his Correspondent abroad and to his Countrymen at  home  If to some it should seem that the Author has  been more desirous to exhibit the fair side of the British Portrait in this its leading  OUTLINE  if fewer of the shadingsslight or deepare yet worked into the piecethan those who may love their Country though affection blinds them not to its faulty featuresmay conceive should be given by a Painter professing to offer a faithful not flattering likenessthey will patiently wait till at least another sitting The Painter does profess to offer such a similitude and he will keep his word if health allows Meanwhile should that choicest blessing of Heaven to the inhabitants of the earth be denied and should this be the last time it may be permitted him to hold the pencil he hesitates not with great force of conviction upon his mind to say there will not he found a friend or foe native or alien in or out of the realm who after a candidhe will not say  uncandid  because malignity and envy can belie their own eyes and sensesbut who after a candid and  HONEST  inspection of what is here placed before themcan say  conscientiously  the resemblance  of this copy to the original is not  as far as it goes  correct  Of skill in the drawing of delicacy in the tints of fitness in the keeping c c c the Painter has not a word to offer on his own account though much very much indeed on either of these points where he has borrowed any of the colours c from  others  but for the  resemblance  being on the whole  exact  he should certainly meet criticism and even malice itself at every possible point they might encounter him did he not firmly believe that their weapons instead of fixing in the canvass of the Painter or in the bosom of the Country would recoil upon themselves  In short he has the fullest persuasion that though this rough draft is set before the public eye in the best  LIGHT  it is precisely in the place where  TRUTH  will allow  PATRIOTISM  to view it  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF MOIRA  MY LORD  SENSIBLE of the value of your Name and proud as I am of placing it before the following pages I boast not of the PERMISSION Upon this occasion I certainly should have availed myself of what I have always considered ought to be the  privilege  of Men of Letters in every free Country and of English Writers in particularto select and to appropriate such Patrons as seem best calculated to adorn to strengthen or to illustrate their subjects  presupposing  them to be on the side of Virtue and Truth  It was by one of those singular events of which the heart ever after retains a pleased impression that some of the subsequent Letters then collecting for the pressfell under your Lordship's eye but had no such favourable circumstance taken place their very nature and design being to offer a friend upon the Continent and all other foreigners a just idea of Great Britainindeed to give the very body and spirit of the time its  immediate  "form and pressure"would have made it absolutely necessaryif not in the beginning certainly in progress of the correspondence to add the  dignity  the  weight  and the  ornament  of the Earl of MOIRA's intellectual military and moral qualities to the many living examples already noticed or yet to be mentioned of the MIND AND CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY and  that  not on the contracted measurement of temporary questions or  local circumstancesnot upon individual acquaintance or personal attachmentbut on the great scale of public and private virtue which  Have bought  Golden opinions  from all sorts  of people  My Lord on that basis it would have been my duty to give every advantage to the execution of my plan in regard to your Lordship as well as other highly appreciated personages of whom without soliciting or consulting any it has been felt as a  justice due to my Country  to write as I have written under the auspices and sanction of Truth  Indeed the Sheets which happened to be placed in your Lordship's view and which had the good fortune to satisfy your judgment while they interested your affections did not specifically unfold to  you the particulars of the plan it is therefore still on this basis I tender you the Workbut under every cheering hope your Lordship will find nothing in the Book to resist the Writer's claims or to make you shrink from your owna subject to which the Public will think I have by no means done full justice in this simple expression of them  For my own part I never could see clearly on what reasoning the maxim was founded that  no Evil is to be spoken of the Dead  any more than on what solid ground it could be argued that  no Good is to be written of the Living  though I enter perfectly into the feeling which makes an ill report of either one of the hardest duties imposed on a generous disposition "A Book"says an Author I have had occasion to quote in the body of this Work "which endeavours to eternize the memory  of truly great and noble Benefactors to whom Works of consummate excellence and acts of piety charity or public spirit have deservedly given superior distinction in the age in which they lived" he might have said or  are  living"is a RECORD OF VIRTUE"  Accept then my Lord this preliminary Volume of English Gleaningsreceive it I beseech you as you will find I have all along requested the Friend to whom the materials which principally compose it were originally sentas a FAMILY PICTUREtaken from the life and shewn immediately after the first sittingthe outline sketched the general figure exhibited with here a particular lineament of boldness and strength and there a trait of more softnessits harmonious proportions lightly touched and an imperfect and rapid but warm grouping of  the wholeAnd do not I entreat you let it be the subject of one moment's regret that as in the original so in the copy I thus casually mention a Nobleman as a first figure which must  inevitably  stand extremely forward in the Piece by whomsoever it may be painted  I have the honour to be My LORD Your most obedient Humble Servant THE AUTHOR  LONDON  July    CONTENTS  LETTER I ARRANGEMENT of correspondence with the BARON DE BDifficulties of Gleaning ENGLAND explained and adjusteda

cherish the intention of visiting the Country from whence I have now the honour to address you and that whether "Grimvisag'd War shall smooth his wrinkled front" or not you will indulge a curiosity which has grown up with you from your earliest youth of passing some time on a little handful of Earth which is comparatively but as an anthill on the Globe but which  like  the anthill is populated by the most industrious ingenious and wonderworking creatures in the universe  The information which your last favour by the route of Hamburgh brought me that your longform'd design of coming amongst us acknowledges a  new  motive in the "animating thought" as you generously call it of our being again within reach of each other is no small addition to my pride and pleasure And your reminding me of my promise to give you some IDEA of my Country in return of the liberal and instructive services rendered me in yours flatters my selflove at the same time that it confirms your good opinion  But you chide me for so long appearing to neglect my native Land Lovingly and like a brother indeed but still you chide and you measure my deserving your reproof from the Letter which I sent you of my being again on English ground when I transmitted to you an account of the flowery  Introduction to Vol I of 'Gleanings through Wales Holland and Westphalia'  day I past immediately after my landing and which the copy of the Books I had the honour to transmit since  will shew was printed as an introduction to what I had imported from other shores  Knowing you could not arrange your affairs so as to leave Germany for the term proposed in less than five years from the period of forwarding to you those remarks I imagined  they  would serve as a general description till a more particular one became necessary and I was willing besides that the observations I stood pledged to give you should not be too remote from the time of their proving useful lest with the loss of all their novelty they should lose some of their interest  Still you are dissatisfied "A Gleaning of England" you argue "would be in  keeping  with the nature and spirit of your friend's former pictorial sketches independent on all the compacts of private friendship not only as the proper finish and crown of the correspondence but as a tribute of gratitude and of patriotism to the talents the dignity and the beauty of the Island"  This is seductive reasoning my dear Baron But you have lived chiefly in an unemigrating  countrypersons of almost all countries may be comparatively so called with the wanderers of Great Britainperhaps therefore you do not know how often our  inland  travellers have trod the beaten and some the unbeaten paths that trips tours journals and journies through every nook and corner of the realm frequently for the sole purpose of detailing or giving in the gross parts of their travel to othersnot to mention a considerable phalanx that make very good books of this kind without travelling at all or at least only from one library to another a kind of literary worms which live upon any old leaf they can get at and are even more abundant than our histories of Englandand that our histories are only to be outnumbered by our authors and that  our  authors are only less incalculable than  yours  Hence it would be no easy task to find a river or a rill a palace or a hut that has not meandered or murmured displayed its magnificence or boasted its humility and been some way or another made known to fame by a "trueborn Englishman"  Were I disposed to break promise I might  add to the above reasons for not redescribing the described a fear to offer you the lenten entertainment of not simply a twice but a two thousand times told tale  Of this there was less danger in regard to the Letters which I formerly wrote from abroad for though many had gone over the ground I took in foreign lands they were very few in comparison of the multitudes who staid at home and for one book that describes another country we have a dozen which treats of our own nay the history of any one of our counties or shiresthe several shires and counties seeming to have contended which shall have produced the largest and longest storywould furnish you with more reading than what we have of trip and tour of all the world besides  And what of other writers Are  they  objectionable Inasmuch as they imitate nature with truth and loveliness as they develope with candour and with skill the yet more interesting pictures of the human heart as they dwell fondly on its excellencies and etch with light hand its little frailtiestaking care even in  their portraitures of vice not to make their shades too sombroustoo deadly darkand scorning with the pride of true Genius to let Hate or Envy mix the colourssuch artists should be welcome though they were a thousand fold more numerous than they are  It will be with peculiar pleasure I shall consult or refer you as we go along to such of those as have displayed the richness and the variety of their native land whether in its productions of art or nature its manners or its genius and who give you a proof of that genius even in their descriptions of the country itself  The point proposed is an amusing interesting and true idea of England and of Englishmen in their various classes and towards your gaining this I will with the helps above mentioned endeavour to be the Guide which a man of your mindingenious candid inquisitive and literarywill have occasion for Neither will I affect to disallow though I am aware it implies a too flattering compliment on myself that a residence in and review of what was to  be seen abroad enables a man to judge with less prejudice of what is passing at home helps him to weigh the possessions of the latter in a surer scale to poise good with good advantage with advantage to make the national estimate with more precision and finally to settle the moral and natural balance of Great Britain with other parts of Europe  It is fortunate for me also that an unshackled freedom as to the delineation of men and things places and people was adopted in the first instance because it will seem a matter of course in the second and I shall thus have full liberty to pursue my usual unencumbered mode of travelling without being set down as eccentric  I beg it may however be fully understood that I do by no means pledge myself or pretend to make a journey THROUGH England but to describe after my manner the things which shall impress my mind in an excursion to particular towns and counties where affection curiosity or partial favour call me IN England an important monosyllable which you will observe  underscored by a triple mark of emphasis on my paper and which in printfor I trust this partial Tour will be acceptable to all minds congenial with yours will be noted by Capitals  And never was there a country more auspicious to travellers of this character than England they may take their ground even as the stick falls and be sure that it will not point to the barren or at worst that the sterile will lead quickly to the fertile The place or the inhabitant the soil the situation or the productions will always render it pregnant with something which will prevent the eye from being long bent on vacancy  These matters then being explained and adjusted before we set out I will take the first fair day to begin our journey diverging from the place of my present addressstupendous Londonthe great central point both of object and observation and to which we may return and pay the tribute and homage it commands when the ravenwinged days of Winter succeed to the livelier months that are  as you will perceive by the date of this Epistle now smiling upon the Country and upon our undertaking  For the present I have only to inform you I shall be prepared with a duplicate of each Letter or each parcel of Letters I may send to guard against the interruption of the mails and the various  moving accidents of flood and field  which continue alas to retard not only the soft intercourse of private friendship but the publick happiness and whatever is most dear to the interests and affections of man  LETTER II  London  May    ALTHOUGH I know you to be well grounded in general history and of course have some previous acquaintance with that of the country from which I now write to you it may not be amiss to desire you will have in recollection even as you direct your course over the cliffs of Albion that the people you design to visit are the descendents of those hardy tribes who lived upon the produce of the chace cloathing themselves with the skins which they threw off when they were in action making thus the animals which were the objects of their pursuit supply them at once with food raiment and a defence against the rigours of the precarious climate in which they were bornthat their huts were scattered over the face of the island without regularity or arrangement their choice of a particular spot  being influenced by its happier supply of water and woodthat much of their bodies were exposed and ferociously coloured with terrific figures either to protect them from the weather or to affright their foes  "When the chill breeze of morning overspread  Wav'd the dark boughs that roof'd his sylvan bed  Up the light Briton sprungto chace the deer  Through Humber's vales or healthy Cheviot drear  Languid at noon his fainting limbs he cast  On the warm bank and sought his coarse repast  With acorns shaken from the neighbouring oak  Or sapless bark that from the trunk he broke  His meal he made and in the cavern'd dell  Drank the hoarse wave that down the rough rocks fell  In open sky he rests his head and sees  The stars that twinkle through the waving trees  On his bare breast the chilling dews descend  His yellow locks the midnight tempest rend  "Such were the race who drank the light of day  When lost in western waves Britannia lay  Content they wander'd o'er the heaths and moors  Nor thought that ocean roll'd round other shores  Viewing the fires that blaz'd around their skies  'Mid the wide world of waters set and rise  They vainly deem'd the twinkling orbs of light  For them alone illum'd the vault of night  For them alone the golden lamp of day  Held its bright progress through th' etherial way"  ABORIGINAL BRITONS  that their towns if  as has been observed a collection of miserable tenements could deserve that name were mostly built upon the coasts where the poorest shed of a modern fisherman in any of the seaside villages to which I shall have the pleasure of conducting you would have been thought a magnificent palace even for the chieftain of their tribesthat the commodities of barter in the majestic island which is  now the emporium and grand mart of the world  were chiefly the hides of those savage beasts on whose flesh they feastedthat unconscious of the endearing ties of affection and love  Uxores habent deni duodenique inter se communes Caesar de bello Gallico  poligamy was permitted to a more than brutal extent and finally that the government which with more of private and of public good and less of evil is now perhaps the most excellent and certainly the  most happy of any upon the globe  was simply derived from the authority of the parent who having given life had as it was thought a natural right to dispose of the gift as circumstances  requiredand moreover that religion which has now for so many centuries held out the blessed influence of the mild system of JESUS CHRIST was in the beginning dictated to the ancient inhabitants of Britain by those barbarous teachers the Druids  But they derived all their military and perhaps most of their energy as men from their BARDS  whose magic fingers strung  The Cambrian lyre  Hail ye who wandered by romantic streams  With harps that glitter'd to the moon's pale beams  Sooth'd by your midnight hymns was many a ghost  Whose cold bones whiten'd Avon's dreary coast  Fir'd by your magic songs the Briton pour'd  A tenfold fury dar'd the uplifted sword  Envy'd the shades of chiefs in battle slain  And burn'd to join them on th' etherial plain  For warrior souls ye sung would deathless bloom  When the cold limbs lay mould'ring in the tomb  with heart on fire  They heard the heroic strains of Cadwall's lyre  In Mador's verse renew its mortal toils  And shine through Hoel's songs in hostile spoils  who have been so variously representedby some as a fraternity not less simple and guiltless than the  Bards awful by their practical virtue no less than by their professional character and benignly chastizing or reproving vices from which they were themselves exemptand as one of their advocate historians expresses it "using no other arms than the reverence due to integrity" while by others they have been drawn as a sanguinary brotherhood which sought the refuge of woods and caves to perpetrate unequalled depredations under the mask of piety sacrificing human victims and accumulating the absurdities of superstition on the horrors of murder The truth lies possibly between both of these descriptions yet it seems on all hands agreed that the original possessors of the fair land to which you meditate a visit were under the controul of these persons who gradually acquired such an ascendancy  " the Druid priests impress'd  A sacred horror on the savage breast  Midst rocks and wastes their GROVE tremendous rose  O'er the rude altars hung in dread repose  A twilight pale like the dim sickly noon  When the midsun retires behind the moon  From sounding caverns rush'd the darksome flood  Each antique trunk was stain'd with human blood  'Twas sung that birds in terror left the shade  That lightnings harmless round the branches play'd  And in the hour of fate the CENTRAL OAK  Shook with the spirit of the God and spoke  The Roman check'd awhile his conquering band  And dropt the imperial eagle from his hand  And seem'd while shudd'ring borne through Mona's wood  To tread the confines of the Stygian flood  "What direful rites these gloomy haunts disgrace  Bane of the mind and shame of man's high race  'Twas deem'd the circles of the waving wand  The mystic figures and the mutt'ring band  Held o'er all nature's works as powerful sway  As the great Lord and Maker of the day  Rocks by infernal spells and magic pray'r  Shook from their base and trembled high in air  The blasted stars their faded light withdrew  The lab'ring moon shed down a baleful dew  Spirits of hell aërial dances led  And rifled graves gave up the pale cold dead  Imperial man creation's Lord and pride  To crown the sacrificial horrors died  That HESUS direly pleas'd in joyous mood  Might flesh their swords and glut their scythes in blood  And TARANUS amidst his tempest smile  And roll innocuous thunders o'er the isle"  RICHARDS's ABORIGINAL BRITONS  that they were in  the end invested with the power not only of pastors but of judges no laws being instituted without  their approbation nor any vice punished with bonds or death but by virtue of their sentence  We are told that the chief means employed by them to keep the people in awe and to extort a ready compliance with their orders was a kind of excommunication Whoever fell under their censure was not only excluded all religions assemblies as a wicked profane person but was also rendered incapable of any public office or receiving any benefit from the protection of their laws and was shunned by the rest of the people as much as if he had been infected with some contagious distemper  The horrible custom which prevailed among the Britons of sacrificing a great number of men at the same time was performed thus they first erected a gigantic figure of a man made up of basketwork so as to contain a great many persons in the body and limbs of it which when filled with the miserable wretches pitched upon for this purpose the whole was consumed with fire It is true that this sacrifice commonly consisted of murderers robbers and thieves yet upon great occasions where the number of criminals did not suffice even innocent persons sometimes shared this cruel fate for they imagined that such practices were very efficacious in appeasing the wrath of their gods and averting any public calamity Some writers have endeavoured to account for the origin of this enormous wickerstatue by telling us that the Britons had been cruelly oppressed by certain giants or at least men of a very extraordinary stature and that in hatred to their memory they thus burnt them in effigy  The chief residence of our Druids was in the Isle of Anglesea and such was the deference paid to them that the Druids of Gaul resorted thither to receive their instructions Besides foreign Druids even the youth of other countries were sent for education into Britain Their method of teaching consisted in making their scholars learn by rote a great number of verses containing the several precepts of their religion and morality for though they preserved the principles of their belief and practice wrote in Greek characters they never suffered any copies to be taken Among other doctrines inculcated by them they seem to have been particularly zealous in enforcing the belief of an immediate transmigration so that the soul was no sooner expelled one body by death whether natural or violent but it was instantly united in the womb to another body This added an acquired courage to their natural bravery making them prodigal of a life they expected to be renewed the next instant The Druids seldom went to war unless some very extraordinary danger threatened their country and then their presence seems to have been of no other use than by their enthusiasm to animate the combatants  The source from whence the above statement has been gathered well deserves the perusal of every foreigner particularly the  introductory part  which gives a clear and distinct view of our constitution and every branch of the legislature It is called the  Geography of England  a book published about fifty years ago and in few hands  I wish you to take this retrospective view that you may be the more forcibly impressed with what your eyes your head and heart will observe and feel when you are amongst us when you shall have had an opportunity to  enter fully into the  contrast  by comparing the same people in their progress to  nearly the perfection of social life  from an unaccommodated and  almost savage state  destitute alike of science and of morals ignorant of every charityevery decencyutterly unconscious of the interior graces of the mind and scarcely bearing the external form of educated man  The subsequent lines from the elegant poem just quoted present a bold finishing of the portrait  Rude as the wilds around his sylvan home  In savage grandeur see the Briton roam  Bare were his limbs and strung with toil and cold  By untam'd nature cast in giant mould  O'er his broad brawny shoulders loosely flung  Shaggy and long his yellow ringlets hung  His waist an ironbelted faulchion bore  Massy and purpled deep with human gore  His scarr'd and rudelypainted limbs around  Fantastic horrorstriking figures frown'd  Which monsterlike ev'n to the confines ran  Of nature's work and left him hardly man  This you will tell me is the infant history of the whole human race the origin of feeble uncivilized mortals through every part of the globe But you will at the same time allow that the progression of these weak strong  diminutive and august beings from the childhood of their powers up to their proudest maturity has been as widely different as the climates by which many of them were separated from each other and I trust you will have various instances ere you quit this great island where formerly it is known "roamed the bear the wolf and the wild boar" scarce more barbarous than their human associateto confirm the character which has so often been given of the Englishthat to be brave and jealous of its LIBERTY  The characteristics of Liberty in the savage state of the Islandits extinction in the early stages of our Monarchy its revival and influence in the present civilized state of manners as producing public security giving rise to public works and calling forth the powers of the mind are given in so animated a style by the amiable Writer who has already thrown such a lustre on the subject of this Letter that it would be unjust to him and unkind to you to withhold them from youparticularly as the performance in which they are delineated being in some measure local a prize Poem at Oxford and long since out of print is of course very scarce at present and though an acquisition to any man who hath preserved it may never fall into your handsbesides that it better illumines the important history of British Freedom than any thing I ever remember to have read in our language  IN Albion's ancient days 'midst northern snows  Hardy and bold immortal FREEDOM rose  She roam'd the sounding margin of the deep  Conway's wild bank and Cader's craggy steep  A bloody wolfskin o'er her back was spread  Ah axe she bore and wild weeds grac'd her head  On Snowdon's cliffs reclin'd she watch'd on high  The tempestdriven clouds that cross'd the sky  Or caught with list'ning ear the sounding gale  When the dread warsong shook the distant dale  At battle's close she roam'd the ensanguin'd plain  And gaz'd the threatning aspects of the slain  Now from ignoble sloth she rarely rose  For  savage  Freedom sinks to mute repose  Now to wild joys and the bowl's madd'ning pow'rs  Gave up the torpid sense and listless hours  Now joyful saw the naked sword display'd  Though brother's blood flow'd reeking from the blade  By tyrants sunk she rose more proudly great  As ocean swells indignant in the strait  And borne in chains from Cambria's mountains bleak  Rais'd Virtue's generous blush on Caesar's cheek  But ah full many a dark and stormy year  She dropt o'er Albion's isle the patriot tear  Retir'd to mountains from the craggy dell  She caught the Norman tyrant's curfew knell  Sad to her view the Baron's castle frown'd  Bold from the steep and aw'd the plains around  She sorrowing heard the papal thunders roll  And mourn'd the ignoble bondage of the soul  She blush'd O Cromwell blush'd at Charles's doom  And wept misguided Sidney o'er thytomb  But NOW REVIV'D she boasts a purer cause  Refin'd by science form'd by generous laws  High hangs her helmet in the banner'd hall  Nor sounds her clarion but at honour's call  Now walks the land with olive chaplets crown'd  Exalting worth and beaming safety round  With secret joy and conscious pride admires  The patriot spirit which herself inspires  Sees barren wastes with unknown fruitage bloom  Sees Labour bending patient o'er the loom  Sees Science rove through academic bowers  And peopled Cities lift their spiry towers  Trade swells her sails wherever ocean rolls  Glows at the line and freezes at the poles  While through unwater'd plains and wond'ring meads  Waves not its own the obedient river leads  But chief the godlike MIND which bears impress'd  Its Maker's glorious image full confest  Noblest of works created more divine  Than all the starry worlds that nightly shine  Form'd to live on unconscious of decay  When the wide universe shall melt away  The MIND which hid in savage breasts of yore  Lay like Golconda's gems an useless ore  Now greatly dares sublimest arms to scan  Enriches Science and ennobles man  Unveils the semblance which its God bestow'd  And draws more near the fount from whence it flow'd  is natural and hereditary to  them in the first instance and habitual to them in the secondthat although they are sufficiently  persevering to endure toil in all the  industrious  they are lovers of the  elegant  arts  and capable of conducting them to the greatest perfectionthat if they sometimes err on the side of a rough honesty they seldom offend on that of a polished insinceritythat the base arts of adulation make no part of the national characterand that although I fear one cannot truly give them the graces of that  general  urbanity which smoothes the path of the traveller in your own and some other countries the more essential duties of generosity pity and protection even to their most determined foes have in various periods of their historyand certainly never more eminently than at presentdone honour to themselves and to humanity and finally thatcompounded as they are of as many nations as the mixtures of language they converse inthat insipid  monotone  of character which deadens most other  countries is not found in Great Britain but that a rich entertaining energetic and almost endless diversity marks the manners and the temper the thoughts and compositions of its native and naturalized inhabitants  Amongst these strong virtues and varied talents that there should be a proportionate quantum of vice of folly and all the shades of these from dark to darker or that some inveterate habits of prejudice and some determined nationalities should therewith blend themselves you will be prepared by your skill in human nature itself to expect to give you as occurrences arise some illustrations of  all  these in a way that may bring to your eye impressively our MIND AND CHARACTER will be the endeavour of this correspondence At the same time my dear Baron on your arrival in this land of wonders ten thousand peculiarities of great and little of good and evilthe former I trust always preponderantwill progressively open on your eye corporeal and be conveyed to your mental vision beyond the powers of pen or pencil to  pourtray even though our Shakspeare held the one and our Reynolds the other  For the geographic description and general situation of the Island you can want no guide as your reading must have long since informed you how we stand in the map of the world and in the favour of nature But were such intelligence necessary I could refer you to various auxiliaries each exhibiting a fair and just specimen of the country and its domestic historians These will all tell you and tell you truly though I think not any of them more clearly or agreeably than an ingenious writer  Dr Aikin  of a very ingenious family "That the face of the country affords all the beautiful variety which can be formed in the most extensive tracts of the globe In some parts verdant plains extend far as the eye can reach watered by copious streams and covered with innumerable cattle In others the pleasing vicissitudes of gentlyrising hills and bending vales fertile in corn waving with wood  and interspersed with meadows offer the most delightful landscapes of rural opulence and beauty Some abound with prospects of a more romantic kind lofty mountains craggy rocks deep narrow dells and tumbling torrents nor are there wanting as a contrast to so many agreeable scenes the gloomy features of black barren moors and wide uncultivated heaths"  When we come to illustrate by particular proofs this general account and when you have  tried  those proofs by the criticism of the living eye and the confirming heart I feel assured that you will allow the justice of an opinion that has for ages prevailed and been circulated concerning usthat no country in the world can equal the cultivated parts of England for the great number of beautiful scenes with which it is adorned The variety of high and low lands both of them forming prospects that fill the most luxuriant imaginationthe richness of the corn fieldsthe freshness of the pasture groundsthe intermixture of plantation and enclosurethe majestic seats comfortable  houses cheerful villages enable cots and wellstocked farms sometimes animating the most retired parts of the country and sometimes rising in the neighbourhood of wellpopulated towns and magnificent cities decorating the most vivid colours of nature with the most ingenious and useful aids of artall these afford a proud delight to the native and must impress every man of every other country with a conviction of its being  indeed  the Queen of Isles  Of its climate we shall have much to say as we pass on meantime we may boldly assert with the sensible Delineator above quoted that although England is situated in the northern part of the temperate zone no country is cloathed with so beautiful and lasting a verdure and that the rigours of winter and the heats of summer are felt in a much less degree than in parallel climates on the Continentwhile the seaports of Holland and of your country my loved friend are every winter locked up with ice ours are never known to suffer this inconvenience I am aware however you have  heard so much of our heavy atmosphere and its melancholy consequences that it will require far more eloquence than is in the possession of your present correspondent to prove that even this humour of our air is attended with various benefits And though you will find all this set down right patriotically in our written books and maintained in our conversations ocular demonstration alone can satisfy you that the diversity of our weather secures the island from those extremes of heat and cold to which other nations within the same degree of latitude are annually exposed and that it is to this  moderation  of the air and  variegation  of the weather that we live to as great an age as in any part of Europe But the prejudice of our fogs and the vaporous evils they are presumed to engender even to the mixing with our blood till they convert us into selfmurderersis I know so strong that I prepare you for my determined yet warrantable vindication of my country on this matter so often as an opportunity of defence presents itself In the mean while the remark of one of our British monarchs as recorded by  Sir William Temple deserves a place in your memory and I take it from that writer that it may be ready for your use when you are our guest It was we are told an observation of our Second Charles in reply to some persons who were reviling our climate "That" said the king "is the best climate where a man can be abroad in the air with the most pleasure or at least without trouble or inconvenience  the most days in the year and the most hours in a day  and that I can be in England"  It would be repetition of a common schoolboy fact to tell you that civil policy has distributed the kingdom into fiftytwo counties or shires of which according to the delineator's perspicuous arrangement there are six northern four bordering on Wales twelve midland eight eastern three southeastern four southern three southwestern six of North Wales and six of South Wales nor should I have mentioned this division had our correspondence been limited to your own eye but as I design it to endeavour at a more general service to foreigners after it has in the first instance paid  its homage to you the little time which has been consumed in thisto you superfluous communicationwill be forgiven  You will now suffer me to be your reporter and precursor as the affections may lead but at present you will be glad of a short pause in the interval of which I am proud to subscribe myself very faithfully yours  LETTER III  Bromley Kent  May    MY intention was to have set out in my accustomed way by gentle stages  "Sedate to think and watching each event" even with the first fair day as I before mentioned that should succeed the period of closing my introductory Letter My purpose was to direct my course from the metropolis of the British empire to one of its celebrated universities making a pause at Cambridgewhich as a seminary of British education and for the literary and sacred awe that a sight of its classic edifices inspires is one of the places every stranger should visit and from thence to have taken a circuitous tour into different parts of Norfolk Suffolk and Huntingdonshire not because those divisions of England afford the best opportunity of giving you a first favourable  impression but because I stood pledged to several beloved friends and relations in each of those counties to parcel out the present summer amongst them and as it is sometimes good policy to begin the display of what we have in store for curiosity or for friendship with the less commanding articles as dealers in sights artfully conduct you to the minuter objects before they usher you to the proudest and largest of all their lions whether the said lions be dead or aliveI imagined it would be a measure of dexterity and prudence to introduce you to our gradual ascents easiest declivities and softest scenery before I took you to the depths of our precipice and summits of our mountains Perhaps too a consciousness that we could do nothing with you in stupendous heights and dizzy eminences till I had beguiled you from the lofty ideas and feelings which the tour you made last Autumn of the sublimities of Switzerland must have inspired might secretly enter into my plan of presenting you to the contrasting views of verdant tranquillity and scenes of contentwhere indeed  Nature herself seems to seek relief from her magnificenceher cloudpiercing rock terrific steep and unfathomed abyss to take repose amongst her lawns recover her serenity in a less aspiring clime and condescends herself to become a cottager in an  English  cottage my friend where I hope to shew you the Goddess has not been a niggard of her favours and that if she has not fixed the humbler dwellings of our land on the cloudtop'd hill or beneath the luxury of a voluptuous sky she has permitted her lowly children to rear them amidst the violets of the field and the lilies of the vale and where so far from their being despoiled or invadedas in some prouder climes where neither a voluptuous sky nor the cloudtop'd hill are secure from violationthere lives not a man who unpermitted dares to pluck one fragrant leaf  Yes I certainly had some motive like this mingling with others for intending to visit our least ambitious counties first But my design has been long interrupted Sickness my dear Baron which so frequently suspends or wholly  frustrates all the proud arrangements of feeble mortals in their journey of life fell on my plans a few hours after I had dispatched to you my second letter from London where I have been confined from that date to the present a lapse of the fairest of the spring months out of which I have only been able to rescue one little week whichchange of air being thought indispensableI have passed at the place of address a small town in Kent situated at the distance only of twelve miles from London and for which besides its being the residence of some beloved friends is endeared to me by other considerations I shall mention in their place I am much recovered  That the purest air should assist in producing the purest pleasure both of thoughts and feelings is natural It is reasonable that the imagery of nature in the diversity of her beauties pressing on the eye and entering into the heart should not a little dispose to such sensations and ideas Persons resident in the country may perhaps be less susceptible of this than its occasional visitors We know that the constant sight of  the most captivating objects invariably diminishes their attraction Indeed we seem to have neither eyes nor ears for what forms a necessary part of our daily and hourly intercourse This must however be understood of things inanimate the loveliest flower may bloom and die unheeded by him whose villa is situated in the midst of a garden and the finest ring of bells will scarcely be heard or at least with little distinction of sounds by those persons who live in the precincts of a church Yet in a general sense none of these persons may want taste or feeling some may have even a relish of natural beauty and some may be enamoured of musiek a similar flower blooming in any remote garden though neglected in their own or in their neighbours and even a less harmonious set of bells in a distant church might call forth their attention and excite their applause We will not entangle this fact with abstract reasoning my dear Baron it is obvious enough that an unwearied familiarity with objects the most beautiful and sublime and those of vegetation are certainly of this kind makes  them literally "fade in the eye" even if they do not "pall upon the sense"  Never perhaps has this remark been more strongly confirmed than in this visit to Bromley after so many months residence in London amidst the perplexities of business and the languors of indisposition I arrived and have had my vernal banquet you see before this most charming month  May  of the twelve has shone itself away The contrast has been extraordinary the sensations of your correspondent have been like what might be supposed to attend a person who after a long and disturbed state of slumber in which he had been dreaming of clouds of dust and of smoke of unmitigating heat and of corroding cares has by a change in his vision found his imagination at length conveying him to scenes the reverse of these Early in the morning I paid my acknowledgment to every object the Sun and all which he warms and blesses with life were in the prime  of their magick and although all was frolick and song kind words and smiling faces around and above sufficient to diffuse smiles and joy through the world I do not believe that within its round there could have been seen a happier being than your friend Mending in health and my spirits every hour this felicity has continued increasing through the week O what a space for man to confess he has been most happy Blest Gleaner thy felicity broke forth in song spontaneous emotions in which every man feels something of the poet The thoughts and feelings of the lay were suggested by the immediate objects These at such a season amid such scenery are always abundant from those you will accept a  SUMMER TRIBUTE TO NATURE  YE vocal copses and ye hedgerows small  And all your tuneful tenantryye trees  Of forest stature in yon monarch wood  And every harmonist which ye embower  Accept the greeting of a friendall hail  Hail to the lane by many a verdant curve  Conducting to the mead a brook unseen  But not unheard musician of the way  The swallow's mazy windings now transverse  And now direct and twittering as she flies  The gentle redbreast hopping in my path  The youngling lamb gay foal and newfledg'd bird  Trying its wing now enterprizing bold  And timid now as dubious of its powers  The tinkling bell upon the leader sheep  And Thou my unambitious friend poor wren  Whom in that hedgerow lowly as thyself  But full of sweets upon thy nest I see  Welcome the thicket blackbird's echoing note  And even thy chirp unheeded as it is  By rural swains familiar with the sound  Unvaried as the lapwing's sparrow trim  Hail to thy thrilling strain sad philomel  And the deep foliage where invisible  Thou pour'st thy widow'd soul O moaning dove  Welcome that wellknown walk between the wheat  Allowing scarce a footway to the step  Of solitary wanderer yet broad  And rich in golden promisespeed it heaven  In the abundant hope of social good  Ye lovers blest to wreathe the tender arm  Around the chosen fair O be content  Though the scant way admits not bosom friend  To  follow  close the steps of her you love  Rather than make more wide the waving fence  Big with the bread of lifeand happy think  Each ear contains a blessing for the poor  Nor is thy note O mourner Linnet lorn  Whom yonder knot of ruthless boys have spoil'd  Of all thy summer hopes to me unwelcome  For from the little robbers I've redeem'd  Thy feeble progeny and thus replace  Their trembling limbs e'en in the cradle small  Which thou hast made there thy warm bosom soon  Shall hush to rest  their  terrors and thine  own  Sweet fields I love ye for yourselves alone  Unsullied by one interested thought  For not a pasture nor a lamb ye feed  Nor one sweet bird nor yet the lowliest shrub  That bowers him while he sings or holds  His green recess your Bard can call his own  But his warm HEART has property in  all  And haply more enjoys of each the sweets  Than they who proudly think the world is theirs  Ah how my spirit freshens as I taste  That liferestoring breeze I climb the hill  To meet the heavenly visitant I seem  To feed upon the vernal banquet as it blooms  'Tis life renew'd and after sickness too  And carecorroding months in the dim town  Where headlong driven amidst the mass of things  Dizzy and indistinct the head confus'd  And a long winter's fever on the mind  Has prey'd Escap'd from that rude roar  There's not a blade of grass nor insect green  It nourishes but has a secret charm  These and a myriad

their small yet throng'd Republick  And thou my faithful  Tiny  The name of a small dog  household friend  Who though twelve months of absence has elaps'd  Since last we metan age in thy short span  Flew to my lap and with an honest joy  Confess'd a friend most welcome thy true love  Ah longer livers who have greater cause  To recognize the hand that gave them bread  And held the cordial to their famish'd lip  In far less time have prov'd ingrate On thee  What more has been bestow'd than the small crumbs  Ev'n from the genial board where I like thee  Was but a guest I gave thy perquisite  Haply a little earlier but reserv'd  For Tiny's banquet yet thy memory  Of this scant boon retains a kinder sense  Than thou Avaro who in one short day  The day of trouble too forgot the man  Who from a wreck built up thy bark again  And sent thee proudly on a golden voyage  From whence return'd thou saw'st thy helping friend  Saw'st thy preserver struggling with the storm  And left him to the billow  Nature come  Come with thy flow'ry herbs and healing balms  And bring along more than Lethean streams  To cure a wound like thisHail woods profound  That shield the Poet from his thankless friend  And thou O MUSE too long deserted maid  Yet in full crouds remember'dah accept  Again thy truant votary deign to tune  Once more his lyre and arm it with new sounds  To soothe his mind disorder'd fit to taste  The gay the solemn through fair nature's works  Welcome  all  These and ev'n the deep'ning din  Of echoing cannon from the neighbouring port  And of yon drum obtrusive for it sounds  To guard my native land and these fair scenes  From nature's direst foe abhorrent war  But far more welcome ev'n than these fair scenes  Or the lov'd MUSE herself the greeting look  Of rural FRIENDSfor still the joy supreme  Of social man must spring from human kind  And yon poor almsman living on the gate  He scarce can open to the passenger  Into whose wellremember'd cap of serge  My Poet purse has each returning year  Drop't its scant mite and blest it as it fell  Speaks in the silent language of his smile  To see me once again more near my heart  And in the deepen'd wrinkle that I trace  In his sunk cheek since last I bade farewell  Than all the sounds of Nature's minstrelsy  Which have mine ear regal'd in this green walk  Or all the blossoms which the sun has pour'd  To charm mine eye into the lap of May  THRICE welcome then my FRIENDS for ye can give  Fresh perfume to the rose Ah whether placed  In spacious halls beneath the sculptur'd roof  Or the small cottage where the ivy climbs  The wall of clay ev'n to the idle moss  And useful houseleek on the broken thatch  A recollection equal fond and true  Await my village favourites to prove  They  are the sovereigns of the scene  MAJOR JOHN SCOTT has a seat at Bromley and while Friendship pure from the ordeal marked by indefatigable perhaps by unexampled diligence in the most arduous cause that ever engaged the attention of men explaining and defending it almost alone against a host for many years even the cause of WARREN HASTINGSof whom you have long since possessed my opinion and it is now the opinion of the greatest part of mankindwhile SUCH a friendship is held sacred amongst us the conduct of this gentleman will be preciouseven had his efforts ultimately failed as much as they have succeeded  MAJOR SCOTT has recently added to his name that of WARING to which is annexed a spacious residence and some ample possessions but wherever he and his family remove as  benevolence  will

their  power  As the sun's ray lends lustre to the moon  O let me haste to yonder rustick seat  Which circles the huge trunk of that old oak  Upon the furzy heath where memory flies  Back to the hour when in my boyish time  I sat and listen'd to the voice of Truth  Reason and Wit and polish'd Elegance  Breath'd from the lips of one who aptly join'd  The Sage's wisdom with the Poet's lore  DOCTOR HAWKESWORTH on whose beautiful and various literature it will be amongst my delights in reserve to expatiate when we meetan Author who to as much of the strength of our Johnson as was either useful or agreeable added the sweetness and amenity in which that great writer was deficient and the same distinction marked their manners as men  My Tutor and my Friend and skill'd alike  To move the fancy and to mend the heart  'Twas to this bench we oft repair'd yon spire  We oft have view'd togethernow alas  It marks the churchyard where his reliques lie  There will I speed and bending o'er the sod  Breathe from my grateful soul the prayer which oft  That soul has pour'd on HAWKESWORTH'S undeck'd grave  Hail social Joy and welcome social Grief  And these sweet scenes where both alternate woo  The tender heart  O what again shall draw me from these bounds  Where with blest Nature Peace and Pleasure reign  With flow'rs and fragrance crown'dWhat sound is that  Hark'tis the MAILHORN's interesting

choristers or rural scenes  Or happy maidens or aught  happy  else  The potent spell that draws me to the spot  Where those I love are  sorrowing  Shades adieu  Without entering farther into the description of the favourite little village which has furnished my Muse with these slight touches of her pencil I shall just note that in the year one of our early monarchs Edgar is said to have presented the manor to the bishops of Rochester who have still a palace here that on the episcopal ground a mineral spring of the quality of the Tunbridge waters invites the valetudinariansbut invites in vainbeing too near  home  I mean the metropolishomefor any body but a few stray patients whom the doctors force to the fountain and whom business or finances limit to the nearest remedies  But though the Bromley mineral has been proved by a chemical analysis to be  more  strongly impregnated with the salutary particles that form the basis of the other water and though Fashion cannot get to Tunbridge without passing Bromleythe few wellbred invalids who really are sent to the former for health never think of stopping to take a draught from the neglected stream of the latter but speed to the more polite fountain where health and the soft vanities of life may be united  There is a college in this village sacred to clergymen's widows erected by one of the bishops of Rochester Dr Warner a descendant from whom is one of the most extraordinary existing characters of our Islandof whom in his order  The county of KENT is too important a part of England upon all accounts to be passed by thus transientlybut it must be the object of some future tour This sketch of a particular spot however will I hope be received as no unfavourable specimen of what it has to  offer when the hour of its gleaning shall come  Meanwhile I cannot but point out to your heart a little village on the return to London from this place called LEE not on account of the Hamlet itself though that being environed by the villas on Blackheath is pleasant but for the sake of some very singularly affectionate circumstances which attach more to the repositories of the dead than the mansions of the living  In the churchyard of the abovenamed village are deposited the remains of the Right Hon Trevor Charles Roper Baron DACRE who is preserved to the memory by more powerful ties upon it than his wealth and titles or the common traditions of his having been born on one day and died on anotherSuffer me to lead you with consecrating steps to what better separates him from the surrounding and oblivious mass of Mortality You will one day I trust read the whole of the inscription graven on his tomb Meanwhile I shall offer you a partial extract  "His afflicted widow as a testimony of their distinguished and unclouded union for upwards of twenty years their unexampled happiness and of the unbounded confidence in which they lived and as a sincere token of her real gratitude for his uniform endearing affection and particular generosityher deepfelt sorrow and tenderest remembrancehas erected this unadorned monument and herself inserted these wellknown truths to his beloved memory accounting them most consonant to the purity of his life his mild disposition his amiable temper and genuine character"  This conjugal tribute proceeds in the same strain and closes with the mourner's assurance that "she submits with pious faith to the will of her GOD and trusts in the same intercession to his mercy with brightest hopes of reunion in eternal bliss"  In the spirit of this attachment she has acted ever since the aera of her loss to the present hour and will probably continue so to deport herself to the latest of her life at least while the power is given her to walk or to be conveyed  to the sacred spot where she has enshrined her heart  Lady Dacre has been in the practice of visiting the grave of her husband twice a day since the time of his burial and as very many of the inhabitants of the village report once in each night She has agreed with a person to keep the precincts of the tomb sacred from every prophanity both of ill accident and malicious design indeed from the elements and winds of Heaven which she literally will not suffer "to visit the grave too roughly" While I was marking these reflections with my pencil I observed the lady who had called them forth coming towards the churchyard with hasty and anxious steps which on perceiving I was seated on the style she directed to a smaller gate but found it locked and seemed much disappointed Unwilling to interrupt her pious progress I quitted the style when bending in acknowledgment she passed into the churchyard but was again diverted from her purpose a party of people it being Sunday were hasting to the tomb in order to read as I had done  its inscription The throng increasing by the entrance of some additional company her ladyship went back into the road where she remained walking backwards and forwards within view of the churchyard till the intruders had left it when returning to the spot from which she had been so long withheld she redoubled her attention and I saw her while I stood aloof myself unseen kneel in reverence at the foot of the grave where after remaining some time I presume in prayer she went back to the villa where in his life time she had so long been blest in the society of him she now bewails  Such are the matin and vesper if not likewise the midnight homages of her affianced heart Yet certain singularities of dress and of manner with the yet greater singularity of an attachment so long faithful to the ashes of its object and perhaps a barbed regret in her bosom that makes her inattentive to if it does not even absorb all thought or care of the world's usages have brought on her I understand much of that wild conjecture malign interpretation and unseemly ridicule which are always attendant  upon every one who deviates from the ordinary ceremonies of life And whosoever presumes to think to act or to feel for themselves are set down either as affected or insane To disregard prescribed forms and ceremonies even in our joys or sorrows is considered as setting at defiance the arbitrary laws of society thus our very smiles and tears are in awe of "the world's dread laugh" and it is hard to say where the controul of fashion may stop or how far her capricious system may dispossess sweet and simple Nature of her rights She has already taught mothers to deny the sustenance of their own bosoms to their own offspring near and dear relatives to look upon it as illbred to follow a parent's or a child's coffin to the grave and to content themselves with performing the last sacred offices by proxya task consigned to hired mournersand to be caught visiting the tomb of a lover wife or husband oftener than the imperious modes of the world allow may not it seems in these refined times pass uncensured  Hallowed however be the tender and generous fortitude and sacred be the pious  griefs that are superior to and that resist such contemptible dominion over all the ribald jests and insults that a reverence for  natural impression  induces And who my dear Baron that has duly contemplated the varieties by which he is surrounded many of which are no doubt appropriate to his own peculiar modes of being acted upon and acting shall dare to accuse any form of words or actions to express joy or woe as the results of affectation hypocrisy or madness because similar sensations are displayed by himself or others by different signs and tokens A genuine felicity or anguish may be felt by a thousand enraptured or suffering beings with equal truth and often with equal force but the external forms and ceremonies maybe diversified even as the causes of our happiness and woe Affliction drives some to the depths of solitude to mourn unseen like the wounded deer but it impels others to rush into society even though in the hour of gladness they might have cherished a love of the shade the effect is different the causes as to the sincerity of the emotion the same GOD knows my friend there is enough  of pretention trick and parade in this world with respect to our feelings our passions and our principles and the shadow is but too frequently mistaken for the substance But in the name of that liberality which we all stand in need of let us not impute to ostentation or to fraud whatever deviates from ourselves where the deviations are only in manner or the usual customs of life And as to the mourner which gave occasion to these remarks if there should still be any persons disposed to scoff at or disbelieve the faithful sentiment that has long conducted her to the place where most things are forgottenthe mansions of the DEAD let them condescend to imitate her bounty to the LIVING Let their charities emulate her's and if by the kinder allotment of Providenceif we may  dare  to call it kinderthey have no relative or friend in the grave to lament if they have none of her  misery  let them be animated by the spirit of her benevolence In this there can be no mockery It is an active spirit that literally goes about to do good Of whichas it is no less difficult to make the doubters of  sorrow and of the affection on which it is founded believe that it can continue its duties after its object has long mingled with the dust in the manner they are cherished and practised by Lady Dacre than to credit that beneficence may be powerful as love even in a bosom where that sorrow has established a thronelet the whole neighbourhood of Lee lend vigour to their faith even if it cannot animate their virtue  Nor even in an age that is marked by wedded infidelity must this be considered as a solitary instance of the unabated love that not seldom in this country survives the life of its objectnor need we confine such demonstration of attachment to this example of the widow bewailing her Lord An equal tribute of constancy has recently been paid as I am informed while this Work is at pressby a husband lamenting his wife the late Countess of KERRY and never did any one carry with her to the grave more general regret or more universal esteem For the profound affliction of the Earl there is no language A simple monument as an emblem of the simplicity which formed a part of her living character is to be erected over her tomb in St Andrew's chapel WestminsterAbbey on which is to be placed the following inscription  "To the affectionately beloved and honoured memory of ANASTATIA Countess of KERRY who departed this life on the th and wàs deposited Here on the th day of April Her most afflicted husband FRANCIS THOMAS Earl of KERRY whom she rendered during years the happiest of mankind not only by an affection which was bounded only by her love for her GOD and to which there never was a single moment's interruption but also by the practice of the purest religion and piety of charity and benevolence of truth and sincerity of the sweetest and most angelic meekness and simplicity and of every virtue that can adorn the human mind has placed this inscription to bear testimony of his gratitude to her of his admiration of her innumerable virtues and of his most tender and affectionate love for her Intending when it shall please GOD to release him from his misery and call him from this world to be deposited with her here in the same coffin And hoping that his merciful GOD will consider the severe blow which it has pleased his Divine Will to inflict upon him in taking from him the dearest the most beloved the most charming and the most faithful and affectionate companion that ever blessed man together with the weight of his succeeding sorrows as an expiation of his past offences and that he will grant him his grace so to live as that he may through his Divine Mercy and through the precious intercession of our blessed LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST hope for the blessing of being soon united with her in eternal happiness"  In every line of this effusion the lover husband and widower are manifest and shew themselves so much superior to all set forms of expression all study about the construction of sentimentsthe very redundancies and repetitions denoting a melting tenderness and fervid sinceritythat the affection and the sorrow may be sworn to as  genuine  the thoughts and the language equally discover a heart overflowing with grief and when the mourner marked on the paper his impassioned intention to be deposited with the dear object of which he was bereaved I doubt not he would in that moment have preferred death to existence that he might have immediately shared her coffin could his life have been resigned without offending the SAVIOUR whose intercession he had invoked But to whatever extent his days may be lengthened there is in the whole of this monumental tribute such an earnest of adamantine faith and truth that if ever the variableness of human nature and all the circumstances which produce it can be set at defiance this methinks will be an instance wherein there can be no shadow of changing And though perhaps that fidelity may take externally a different shape from that of the forementioned votaress of grief the principle will be as ardent as pure and as immutable  LETTER IV  NORTH RUNCTON NORFOLK  July    SURELY the demon of disappointment had fixed my foot as by a spell I have been enchained in town another of the lovely months by unyielding circumstances even till a  few hours  only remained to keep sacred my promise to a family which resides a hundred miles from the capital  It may however serve as no bad specimen of our English carriages and horses to mention the speed with which I have been conveyed over the said hundred milesand for the most part during the hours of darkness  How shall I gain credit from my Continental friends in  general  though you I know will rely upon the fidelity of my reportwhen I desire those who have been accustomed to the  sickly movement of the reluctant wheel over German leagues of absorbing sandwhere man beast and machineso heavily are they moved along appear to be alike torpid pardon me my friendhow shall I dare even to  ask  such to believe that an Englishman may take his seat at nine o'clock of the evening in a common public vehicle of this countryprofoundly atmospherical and constitutionally saturnine as we have been deemedand be rolledboundingly over the almost velvet surface of one hundred miles by the corresponding hour of the morning and  that  in comparison of the Dutch Persian or German stagesalmost without being sensible of any motion at all  Foreigners unfamiliar to such luxury might think that the  feathered  Mercury was conveying them on his own pinion or flying with them in a chariot of gossamer Yet this velocity is an ordinary fact which every man in England can attest and if a traveller can bear the expence of what we call going post that is in one of our postchaises more than doubleI believe I might venture to say nearly treblethe number  of miles might be measured in the same space of time  What methinks I hear some of my Continental friends just unpacked from a German  post waggon  as you call your stage coaches  things  which  you  will soon have the candour to allow are but very awkward and misshapen imitations of our broadwheel waggona huge piece of workmanship made use of to convey sacks tubs boxes barrels household furniture and other deadweight luggageWhat Monsieur le Baron would this correspondent of yours attempt to persuade us his cloudy countrymen are whirled in their  airy chariots  at this rate then may we believe that Phaëton did  indeed  assail the regions of the Sun and that the winged steeds of Apollo and of Jove himself are outstripped by the public stagecoaches  Attend to what one of your own countrymen the liberal and goodhumoured MORITZ who performed a  pedestrian  journey of a few weeks through several parts of our island in and which is preserved in DR MAVOR'S valuable compendium of the most celebrated  British Tourists  a candid and elegant selection which shall go to you with my full commendation  "Our little party says Mr Moritz now got into two  postchaises  These carriages are very neat and lightly built so that you hardly perceive their motion as they roll along the firm smooth roads they have windows in front and on both sides The horses are generally good and the postillions particularly smart and active and always ride on a full trot A thousand charming spots and beautiful landscapes on which my eye would long have dwelt with rapture were now rapidly passed with the speed of an arrow"  Mr Moritz's succeeding remarks are extremely natural and amiable "Our road" continues he "appeared to be undulatory and our journey like the journey of life seemed to be a pretty regular alternation of up hill and down and here and there it was diversified with copses and woods the majestic Thames every now and then like a little forest of masts rising to our view and anon losing itself among the delightful towns and villages"  and postchaises of Great Britain  I make all possible allowance my dear Baron for this incredulity on your side of the great gulph that separates us and though every joint of me has often borne witness to the truththe aching truth of my assertionwhen in or after a long sad solemn slow and dizzy drag from one town to another across the tracts of almost Arabian sandsnot to say desarts of some parts  of the Continent I must own I have been able to endure it only by the promise of finding better things at the end of thema promise which I confess has been amply performed Yet I will be content even by you my candid friend to be thought a prejudiced reporter till you have tried the assertion here advanced and confirmed it  In the mean while I hazard nothing by observing thatthough it is certainly a peculiar remarkhad we no attraction except our Roads to draw foreigners to England they would be well paid for their journey by the voluptuous novelty of passing from one extremity of the island to the other in our little portable parlours and wheeled drawingrooms with an ease expedition and elegance of which no other people in Europe can offerof which indeed they cannot conceive even an idea  Into one of these public vehicles then but into one on the last best principle of improvement I was carried along a public road after evening teaover which had not my mind been otherwise occupied I might have toyed  with a book or played with the teaspoon in contemplation or vacancyand yet without any apparent hurry and no confusion I was ready to meet the birthday friends at a villa more than a hundred miles distant from London In truth almost as soon as the sun gilded the anniversary with his beams too soon even for a rural breakfast and by half a day too early for a wellbred town  dejunè  and in repetition I must desire you not to forget that I began my journey while that blessed orb was yet cheering my path with his setting beams  It is from that villa then I now address you in the language of our

give or find and  pointing out to you in these etchings  I will not however refuse you a list of the towns which form the regular tracts from LONDON to LYNN the only town of note bordering in this part of Norfolk in case you should pass them in daylight in the meditative way I should myself have used had I not been governed at my setting out by uncontroulable circumstances  And this turnpikeroad intelligence is ready cut and dried for you in at least as many books as there are miles betwixt London and Lynn I shall however borrow from the Roadist deemed the most accurate and whose

because there is not one of them which in the months most favourable to excursion will not offer something for the curiosity pleasure improvement or admiration of a sensible traveller But as I think meagre descriptions far worse than no descriptions at all I shall only select one or two prominent points of remark to serve for memoranda as you pause to examine or should you pass rapidly that you may not entirely  overlook  or run by them  The noble and extensive Forest of EPPING will have a charm for the lover of naturefor you my Friend in every tree in every bush and the lover of art will see fair reason to be pleased with the many splendid villas and elegant cottages interspersed about and within itThe word cottage is now used a little proudly if not affectedly to signify the very beautiful and frequently the very superb residence of  cottagers  who carry the splendours of the town into even  such  recesses of the country as make Nature hide her blushing GRACES amidst her own roses or seek a modest refuge and lie concealed in some green dell of her forest upon a simple sod as if fearful of setting her timid foot on the flaunting garish carpets of her ostentatious rival EPPING FOREST was granted by Edward the Confessor to his favourite Randolph Pepper afterwards called Peverell who it is said having a beautiful lady for his wife Wililam the Conqueror fell in love with her and soon proved himself the ladys conqueror for the hero had a son by her and called him William Peverell But heroes you know have not time to spare for the conquest of themselvesthe public

maiden of fifteen if she be wellborn and chastely educated even if she has a strong but pure passion in her heart and perhaps its first love has more selfgovernment and virtue than a thousand such conquerors  AUDLEY END near WALDEN will gratify your love of architectural antiquity and your admiration of nature whose charms are ever young were you to give it a whole day's attention and homage The villa called SHORTGROVE at about forty miles from London occupied by MR WYNDHAM has for its owner one of the first men of our island whether he be considered as an English nobleman a relative or a friendthe EARL of EGREMONT And  MarkHall  near Potter'sStreet is or was lately the seat of one of the LUSHINCTON'Sa family which on account of its integrity might be shewn to foreigners amongst the worthies of the land  where you may see the pictures at full length  I can scarce form any idea of what a sensible foreigner must feel on his first view of the  various novelties which are obvious even on the  surface  of England To a German Dutch  or French traveller it must certainly seem an  original  land because it is in many respects altogether dissimilar from what either of them  can  have seen on their native shores or indeed any where else The agriculture the gardening the natural and artificial arrangements the vegetation and numberless productions both of the fancy the spirit and the genius are peculiar Instead of stately rows of trees awful and equidistant in the straight line and a level of many an unvaried league that fatigues the eyeand a stony ridge in the middle of the  highway with sandy sinking slopes on each sidewhich though canopied with aspiring foliage and displaying an air of gothic grandeur amusing and imposing at first soon weary by their uniformity and by the heavy hours we are constrained to pass in the sad sepulchral vehicles that "drag their slow length along" instead of these a traveller no sooner recovers the dizziness of passing the water than all at once he finds himself in almost every part of the island transported as it were to a new region where every object must have the effect of a magical illusion In an almost flying car he is lightly and rapidly borne on a smooth expanse to the summit of a flowery fertile hill or down the soft declivities of a valley the horsepath usually social enough to admit three or four and sometimes as many carriages abreast all running as we call it bowlingly on the nail with scarce a pebble in the way on a fine gravel which binds to the firmness and even in the first trading country in the world almost preserves the beauty of a gardenwalk without one dislocating rut The footpaths  he perceives are either across cultivated pastures or corngrounds or through clustering thickets or by woods of more ambitious extent and yet not sufficiently deep and continuous to be drearySuch farms and cottages too as the sons of Industry and Toil can rarely boast in any other land are seen springing up to cheer his progress betwixt village and village town and town and then each side of him even in the public highway he is presented with either an entertaining or a rich variety by the innumerable and rapid turnings of the path forming a complete contrast to the ceremonious foliage of the roadside scenery of the Continent There you know the solemn firs are often drawn up like grenadiers at rollcall or a more formidable troop of giants standing as perpendicular and at measured spaces as if they had been drilled just in the style of our old English Barons when they stalked in their buckram and brocade to pay their court to his or her Majesty of England To say truth like our own scenery in those days of stateliness when our gardens exhibited birds  beasts and fishes in evergreengigantic avenues of forest oaks  all in a row  entrenchments of rampartlooking ditches and mantling moats and dreadful drawbridges and embattled halls and turreted abbeysall of them duly haunteda ghostroom and an apparition in eachthe very gates and walls bespeaking power and frowning defiance In short when Nature herself instead of the  Nature says the fascinating Goldsmith is now followed with greater assiduity than formerlythe trees are suffered to shoot out into the utmost luxuriance the streams no longer forced from their native beds are permitted to wind along the vallies spontaneous flowers take place of the finished parterre and the enamelled meadow of the shaven green  liberal and graceful freedom with which we now array her was forced into stilts  Those were the days my dear Baron when even our English roads werewonderful to tellmore impassable than the worst of yours when our communications with each other whether by epistolary or personal intercourse were encumbered by so many delays and difficulties that had not most of the movements  of those times been solemn and slow the feelings in certain casescases of separation for instance from a beloved objectmust have in every desperate effort hazarded the neck of the enamoured youth who doubtless would have preferred a dislocated limb or a broken bone to a broken heartthe proper death nevertheless of absent lovers  More seriously however to speakbefore the grand public work of our turnpike roads a journey of a hundred miles was an affair of such peril and protraction that it was deemed prudent for a soberminded man to make some very solemn arrangements in his family concerns before he set out nor after all was this formidable undertaking entered upon without the parties about to separate taking leave of each other as if they were probably never to meet again  How then can I expect credit for our unrivalled improvements in the art of travelling improvements which would stagger the belief of any of our forefathers and make them suppose themselves under some illusion of the  senses and disbelieve their own eyes were they suddenly to become spectators  I cannot yet close this great national object which is amongst the very first to attract and to astonish a foreigner The  perfection  of that object is yet to be mentioned I mean the invention of our Mail Coaches  Among the many aids which have been given to commerce and public convenience during the present century there is not one which deserves better of the nation and has a more just title to a place in this work than the reformation which has been made in the administration of the PostOffice by Mr Palmer Some general ideas of the reform which has since taken place were first suggested to Mr Pitt in the Autumn of and in the beginning of the following year a plan was laid before him After having maturely considered it the Minister determined that it should undergo a trial This original plan which though it has since been greatly improved contains all the principles of the undertaking and in its present state of perfection is a curious and interesting memoir In order to give a general outline of this extensive undertaking I have made such selections from the plan presented by Mr Palmer to Mr Pitt in as will be sufficient for that purpose  "The post at present observes Mr Palmer instead of being the swiftest is almost the slowest conveyance in this country and though from the great improvement in our roads other carriers have proportionably mended their speed the post is as slow as ever It is likewise very unsafe as the frequent robberies of it testify and to avoid a loss of this nature people generally cut bank bills or bills at sight in two and send the parts by different posts  "The Postmasters General lately advertised directions to the public how to divide a bill in such a manner as to prevent its being of any use to the robber Rewards have also been frequently offered for the best constructed mail cart on some plan to prevent the frequent robbery of the mail but without effect Indeed it is at present generally intrusted to some idle boy without character mounted on a wornout hack and who so far from being able to defend himself or escape from a robber is much more likely to be in league with him"  The post should certainly be as safe and expeditious as any other regular stage in the kingdom for till it is so whatever penalties are held out to coachmen carrying parcels the public as their convenience directs will send by the safest and most expeditious conveyance to the very great loss of the revenue of the PostOffice  The comparison betwixt the post and the diligences from Bath to London will pretty nearly serve for the whole kingdom The diligence that sets out from Bath at four or five on Monday afternoon will deliver a letter about ten on Tuesday morning while the post that leaves the same place at ten or eleven on Monday night does not deliver a letter till two or three on Wednesday afternoon▪ and frequently much later Nothing therefore prevents the post from losing the conveyance of many more letters than it does at present but the cheapness of the carriage when compared with that of the diligence By the post a letter costs only fourpence and by the diligence booking carriage and porterage will make the charge amount to about two shillings nevertheless many persons both at Bath and Bristol send by the latter and indeed throughout the kingdom every letter to which expedition is necessary is now sent by diligences where they are established It is therefore advised to contract with the masters of these diligences to carry the mail and a guard to protect it and this it is presumed may be done by them not only better but as cheap as the present method which in general is threepence per mile for the boy and horse The diligences should go at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour so that allowing a quarter of an hour to change the horses and for each Postmaster to change the bags the mail will be conveyed from Bath to London in sixteen hours Besides these machines would have a recommendation above all others both for passengers and parcels as they would be punctual to time and be protected by a guard which must prove an additional motive for the masters to contract the cheaper with Government  "Diligences are now established from almost every town in the kingdom to London and in many cities and capital towns where the crosspost communicates as from Bath and Bristol to Birmingham Liverpool Chester Oxford Exeter Plymouth Portsmouth c which would be a great benefit to the crossposts and in many places where they are not yet established a contract for the mail might induce people to do it  "If the diligence was free of turnpikes it would be a great saving to Government and a very trifling tax on tolls which for a carriage and pair from Bath to London is about nine shillings and a carriage and four eighteen it would be so much towards payment of the carriage of the mail and taken all through the kingdom must amount to a very large sum annually  "It is certainly a very great hardship on individuals that they are liable to an heavy penalty on sending letters by diligences c as they may go out at an hour when the post does not and at a time when a letter requires dispatch yet several pounds must be paid for an express or a servant sent post to do what may be done much better for half a crown by the coach All that Government wants is to secure the postage of any letter not sent with parcels of goods or by private hands The great object therefore must be to carry cheaper safer and swifter than any other carrier and that will secure the business to the PostOffice better than any penalties whatever  "The Postmaster of every town must know the exact time the mail should arrive and either himself or servant be ready at the inn where the horses change with his packet of letters to put in the general bag and to take out those brought for him He must be very inexpert indeed if he cannot change his packets as soon as the ostler does his horses If he is not ready the diligence by no means to wait If on inquiry the salaries of officers are not proportioned to the trust and duty Government will undoubtedly advance them but no more keep a negligent servant in a department of the PostOffice than in the Excise  "As the hours of sending off the mails from every office in the kingdom are settled to accommodate the General PostOffice by the proposed alterations they may perhaps be changed in most places to some the alteration may prove convenient to others inconvenient yet at the very worst the consideration that the letter which may be sent on the morrow will arrive at the place to which it is directed as soon as one now sent today will far overbalance it  "A Committee of Gentlemen Merchants c in each town might perhaps suggest a better method of regulating the post for their own district than persons always employed in the office in London Some intelligent outriders who travel for orders to the different parts of the kingdom and have experienced inconvenience in their correspondence would be likely to furnish very useful information which the office should not fail to encourage from every quarter Where new roads are continually forming and manufacturing villages growing into large towns the post of such a country must be liable to continual variation and open to great improvement  "It may be advisable to consult with the Merchants c in London how far it may be proper for the General Office to shut at seven or eight in the evening The 'Change being shut up at three and the Bankers' shops at six the business would be much better done than at twelve at night or one or two in the morning and cheaper to Government On examination perhaps it may be so regulated that the letters may be delivered so much earlier than they are at present as to leave full as much time after the receipt of the letter to answer it as there is now though the post would go out earlier The encreased expedition of the post would also allow for the missing a day Indeed an early hour at the office would occasion earlier hours for the dispatch of business that is to be communicated by it  "It is presumed that by these and other improvements which may be made letters might be delivered in nearly half the time they now are from many parts of the kingdom and as the public pay an additional tax with less reluctance when it is grounded on great improvement and convenience the postage might be advanced in the proportion of sixpence for fourpence but double and treble letters in a smaller degree for as the diligence can carry any weight of letters every encouragement should be given to send small packets by the post and as Government would pay about threehalfpence a pound for one hundred miles the public should not be made to pay one shilling and fourpence by the ounce  "By the act of the postage of a single letter which used to be threepence for any distance under eighty miles was altered to one penny for one stage and twopence for two stages under the idea that by doing it so cheap Government would have the great number of letters sent by carriers c in preference to them not considering that they were sent for expedition not for cheapness By the present regulation of the prices of postage from the General PostOffice a single letter is a penny for one stage twopence for two stages any distance beyond that and not exceeding eighty miles threepence From eighty miles to any part of England be the distance what it may even BerwickuponTweed which is three hundred miles only fourpence so that beyond eighty miles there is no sort of proportion kept between the distance and the charge though to Edinburgh the charge is sixpence Letters which pass through London are charged the postage to London and from thence to the place of its destination  "The American charge seems to be on a better plan than that in England viz For a single letter above sixty miles fourpence above one hundred sixpence above two hundred eightpence not above three hundred tenpence c Suppose the charges in future were at the following rates throughout Great Britain viz A single letter not exceeding twenty miles twopence forty threepence sixty fourpence eighty fivepence onehundred sixpence and after that an additional halfpenny on every twenty miles to and from any part whether the letter passes through London or not  "The gross receipt of the Post office annually from the time it was first established in the reign of Charles II to the act passed by Queen Anne for its improvement gradually increased to l and is now supposed to be about l  "From the proposed and other improvements the revenue would not only be increased to a very considerable amount but the public be better accommodated Some regulation might also be adopted with respect to the privilege of franking Perhaps the best check on abuses in this particular would be to oblige the members of Parliament to write the day of the month and year on the frank and to charge the letter if not sent to the office the day it is so dated  "Postage is really no tax but a fair and reasonable price for so much labour which Government by its monopoly is enabled to do cheaper than any individuals and should do with greater expedition and safety or submit to the loss of the public's employing other carriers in preference to theirs"  This plan which has since been adopted in its material points with so much success was necessarily delayed by the changes which took place in the administration of the country Though it should be mentioned to the honour of Mr Palmer that his scheme of reformation was approved by all parties and that the several Ministers as they succeeded each other gave every proper encouragement to him The difficulty he found in executing his plan did not proceed from Government but from the Post Office from whence indeed he experienced a degree of opposition which it is not necessary to mention in the detail and on which I shall only observe that it does not appear upon the most favourable examination to be reconcileable to any principle of common sense policy or integrity At length however the ability ingenuity and indefatigable spirit of the present Comptroller General under the protecting wisdom of the present Minister has brought this undertaking to a very high degree of perfection and has given an example of public oeconomics which never before existed in this or any other country  Of the present state of this most useful undertaking I have to observe from the best information that Mr Palmer has more than fulfilled every engagement he made with government The contracts for the conveyance of the mails are made at l per annum less than was originally agreed forthe acceleration and extension of the posts are far greater than were at first promised the mails being now conveyed not only in half the time they used to be to most parts of the kingdom but in onethird and even onefourth of the time in many of the cross poststhese posts are all likewise made daily instead of three days per week to towns and likewise the same additional convenience given to towns on the general posts  Thus has Mr Palmer to the very great and acknowledged advantage of the whole kingdom given accelerated expedition perfect security an assured punctuality and an increased revenue to the administration of the British General Post Office Mr Palmer has at this time I understand a petition in Parliament for their fulfilment of their agreement as to two and an half per centageI enter into no Post Office disputes but I think and the country thinks with me the projector of so extensive a national good cannot easily be overrewarded    which increase  the accommodation and speed of every thing most valuable and most precious to the business  and pleasure of this illustrious Island almost to a winged celerity In the days of  our ancestorsnay within the memory of many persons still living one relative who should  have summoned another to his bed of sickness might have died even a lingering death without  the friend most relied on to close his eye or to receive of that eye  its  last lovebeam the heart  condemned by some stern necessity to throb alone far distant from its associate might  indeed  have been broken long before the balmy comfort of affection could have  been supplied even by those who think with the Poet that "a Friend is worth all hazards we can run" and a thousand advantages in public with ten thousand endearments in private life are facilitated and connected  with this interesting and noble invention It is in fine the crown both of our commerce and correspondenceand were temples now built or monuments erected to those who by public works have expanded public good while the benefactors are yet living I know not of any man more deserving a mark of his country's gratitude than he who conceived and carried into practice this great national idea It deserves the emulation and adoption of every other clime that has but a relish of business or of social love and next to the project of any post at all and the invention of writing to confide thereto the secrets of our hearts and our most important worldly concerns the establishment of a MALL COACH IN ENGLAND will be honourably recorded  The present has been the first opportunity of shewing my gratitude to it as an individual and I do it heartilyfor though it cannot literally  Waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole  nor convey my affectionate wishes from the  British to the German empirethe salt sea and many a frowning league of dry land dividing usit will convey this Letter to the confine of the ocean where I hope the most favourable wind "will kiss the sails to make the vessel" which is to take charge of it "nimble" and it enables me to inform you of a luxury that will not only smooth but speed your way to the hand of yours affectionately  PS I ought not to have forgotten what I farther owe to the MailCoach on the score of bearing me to this flowerencircled villa which is situated in the midst of a garden and where I found every face and heart so happy to receive me that the wishes which filled my heart overflowed in the following spontaneous address which if it breathe not of Poetry is replete with truth and on that sacred ground you will allow me to preserve it in our correspondence  PARENT of Fancy Muse adored the art  Of fair imagining is thine and thine  The power more awful and sublime of Her  Whose inspiration is from Heav'n itself  CelestialTRUTHO woo her then to raise  Ev'n to the  source  of ev'ry good my strain  That thence may stream on each revolving day  That gave to Earth one of Heaven's fairest works  Fairest and besta benediction pure  Ev'n as the soul for which I form the pray'r  And may the blessing reach to all who love  What is most lovely grant it GOD of GODS  LETTER V  NORTH RUNCTON  July    ALTHOUGH I have repeatedly renounced all methodical movements and set out with a design of furnishing you with a  general idea  of my country derived from a description of particular places and people I am desirous that no material objects should be left unnoticed which in a particular manner  distinguishes  the Island in its present state and may assist you in forming a right notion of us  Hence I should methinks have incorporated with my last Letter respecting the ROADS and CARRIAGES some information as to the good things to which those Roads will lead you  And here again my dear Baron I am constrained by the truth which you venerate to assign the Palm to Old Englandby an unqualified preference of the INNS of this Country  to those either of Germany France or any other nation in the world and to do away all appearance of partiality herein I will boldly appeal for attestation of this judgment to every inhabitant in that world who has had opportunity of proving its unbiassed equity by living amongst us and of making fair comparisons Ere you have gone over as much of our ground as from London to this place I will confidently make the appeal to you my Friend The  reality  of a comfort of which other countries have scarcely an  idea  will be visible to you at the first English Inn where you may stop and accompany you to the end of your journeyThe warmth the neatness the attention the attendance the  propretè  of the apartments the cleanliness of the food the polish of the furniture of the plate and of the glassesthese will  always  strike you and not unfrequently the  elegance  of the rooms and  splendour  of the accommodation Every foreigner who has either taste or feeling must candidly give the precedency to us in all these articlesIndeed the comparisons which a  travelled  visitant from  your own shores  must  make would be more victorious for us than any eulogy of our own Englishmen are so much in the habit of seeing these things in all parts of this countrywith very few exceptions indeedthat they are scarcely seen at all or noticed only by the indignant manner in which we mark the exceptionsa dirty disgusting Inn fitted up for  les gens comme il faut  being as rare to be met on English ground as it is common on the Continent There indeed we occasionally see a dismantled castle or dilapidated  chateau  degraded to a chearless roadside publichouse where men horses hogs and other cattle house stable stall and stye on the same floor and to say truth the beast has often the best birth Huge rooms beds shabbily sumptuous a kind of majesty in tatters long chill passages damp floors high dingy cielings and unwieldy figures in tapestry where the spider as in mockery drawing kings and warriors into his web sits brooding his venom in the ruined face of a Princess or makes his den on the bosom of a Queen in decay But where shall we  find the triumphant enjoyments which the Writer with whose acute remark rich diction and unrivalled morality you will in due time I trust be better acquainted where I say shall we find those homefelt public luxuries which our Samuel Johnson so often considered as one of the grand domestic  perfections  of his country an English Inn or Tavernthe presidential chair of which upon account of the unrestrained ease and freedom it bestows he gaily called  "the throne of human felicity"  "As soon" said he "as I enter the door of a tavern I experience an oblivion of care and a freedom from solicitude when I am seated I find the master courteous and the servants obsequious to my call anxious to know and ready to supply my wants Wine then exhilarates my spirits and prompts me to free conversation and an interchange of discourse with those whom I most love There is no private house in which people can enjoy themselves so well as a capital tavern" But he must be understood my dear Baron to mean an ENGLISH tavern because the circumstances that constitute that enjoyment can in their perfection  be found no where else and not only in our capital taverns but in almost every wellregulated inn upon the road in every possible direction of the country and he might have added there only am I regaled by decency as a handmaid waiting on appetitethere only are the eyes taste and touch at once banquetted And this is true not only of our  capital  inns but of other houses of accommodation on a more circumscribed scale Most of our villages and almost every stage have to boast their full share of the like attracting properties and it is very seldom indeed that our "Golden Fleece" "Fair Lamb" "White Lion" "Black Bull" or even "Blue Boar" hold out a sign that when we accept their invitation we shall find ourselves disappointed And all this awaits you at a moment's warning Your carriage no sooner stops than it is surrounded by alert attendants who  measure  you even as they hold the obsequious arm to assist your descent and almost by an intuitive glance know by the step and voice of a traveller be the disguise of dress what it mayfor we have many men of property who affect to be  slovenswhat are his pretensions with as much accuracy as if he had settled them at the Herald's Office or St James's From the instant you are  ascertained  the motion of your eye is arbitrary your temper is vested with supreme authority and your very nod has the  fiat  of Jove's The signs of wealth no doubt will in  all  countries make certain distinctions in the courtesy of people who live by it and it is very difficult for those signs to be concealed either by affected humility on the one hand or by assumed poverty on the other PROPERTY in every country where it is an object of importance and where is it not such discovers itself in despite of every counterfeiting and one of our adroit English waiters who as I before observed takes the dimensions of your quality while with a kind of unobserved observation he is conducting you from your chaise into a room could no more mistake a man of property for a needy person because he might travel in a rusty wig sloucht hat or threadbare coat than he could conceive an adventurer to be a man of property from seeing him rush from  the carriage in tawdry habiliments Plenty and indigence from a certain habitual consciousness which they can neither of them put on or off with their cloaths betray themselves in a very short time and literally in the case we are now stating  he who runs  may read them Not that you are to infer from hence that the landlords of our inns and taverns or the people in their train are attentive only to rank and richesthough these will in all societies be allowed their privileges even were they not insisted ona ready hand a smiling countenance a brisk step and a chearful room are offered to all degrees of passengers with as few surly exceptions as in a rule so broad and general can be imagined and every foreigner would feel in a single half hour let him have come from whatever part of the world he might that he was in England and that he could be only in an English tavern  Doctor Johnson indeed gave some reasons besides those above quoted for HIS preference of a tavern life not so immediately in support of my arguments in our favour and yet related with so much glee and sincerity when his mind  and fancy were in tune that I will here transcribe them into a NOTE  "Let there be ever so great plenty of good things ever so much grandeur ever so much elegance ever so much desire" says our Doctor "that every one should be easy in a private house in the nature of things it cannot be there must always be some degree of care and anxiety The master of the house is  anxious  to entertain his guests the guests are  anxious  to be agreeable to him and no man but a very impudent dog indeed can as freely command what is in another man's house as if it were his own Whereas at a tavern there is a general freedom from anxiety You are sure you are welcome and the more noise you make the more trouble you give the more good things you call for the welcomer you are No servants will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do who are incited by the prospect of an immediate reward in proportion as they please No Sir there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn"  for your amusement either at the moment you have read this passage or any other that may better suit you  And now my friend having promised you the best  horses  the best  carriages  and the best  roads  we will see what you have to expect from some of the  places  to which they will convey you and in confirmation of what we asserted in the letter that opened our correspondence  that"were we only to follow the falling stick it could not point to barren ground" we may take our first views of the country as it happens to lie before us from the place of address  NORTH RUNCTON situated exactly an hundred miles from London and three short ones from Lynn in Norfolk is one of the numberless unassuming villages which ensures attention though it aspires not to admiration The scenery around is soft agreeable and engaging the peasantry wholesome and healthy the yeomanry diligent ingenious and at their ease and the neighbourhood respectable yet the village itself though too "low for a high praise is too high for a low praise" can boast only two families which are termed independent gentry that of Mr Lane who has another gardenencompassed villa and the friends of whom I am at present a guest But you will here find if you allow yourself time a very interesting specimen of those unambitious beauties of nature with which this country abounds and which not only give an  idea  of content but tend to produce the  reality  of it in the beholder The more obvious prospects maintain the character I have already given them and if you will follow my usual custom of quitting occasionally the open to see what the covert yields you will be recompensed by those retiring graces which lie embowered amidst leaves and blossoms in our sequestered scenes long green lanes various foliage overarching them the hedges at intervals interspersed with trees of irregular height and bulk deriving charms even from their confusion some bending with age over the path of the traveller as if for his pity and support some standing firm as if in the pride and independence of youth their vernal heads erect in air and seeming to brave the lightning which I observe has left a shattered oak in the same hedgerow without a green leaf to shew that it had ever vegetated These will all repay you for the humility of an unostentatious walk embalmed too by the wild fragrance of roses and woodbines blooming about your walk through a diversity or mazes now so alcoved  by nature as scarce to admit the penetrating sunbeams of this radiant season and now opening upon you the unbroken day and the sublime orb from whence it springs  Then the enclosures the rustic stiles leading into them the footpaths direct or in windings conducting to innumerable little farms and cots unmarked by the highroad Traveller who can never know either the prosperity or population of his country one half of which is hid like the violets amidst the lowliest glens and humblest scenery  This pleasant village leads by one of the enviable public roads I have recently described to LYNN before however we proceed to which it may be clearing our way as we go to present you with some general character of this county the largest proportion of which is said to lie West and NorthWest of NORWICH but the part at which we begin our correspondence is called WestNorfolk and on account of several advantages in due time to be explained is by far the most auspicious to a traveller at this season of the year  Were you to consult all the books which have been written on NORFOLK a year's assiduous reading would scarcely bring you to the end of them for besides Doomsdaybook the mighty fountain of our English annals you would have to wade through the copious channels of DUGDALE SPEED SPELMAN PARAGE CAMDEN KENT BLOOMFIELD PARKINS SWINDEN MACKRIL MARTIN BROWNE and many other streams of intelligence in doing which it would be well if Patience Memory and Truth herself are not drowned The histories of Norfolk says a sensible Tourist and of its principal towns are comprised in so many folios quartos and books of all sizes as collectively are too voluminous and expensive and several of them too scarce to be easily procured These amongst other reasons induced the Observer to compress into as small a compass as possible an epitome of what seemed most worthy of particular notice and he has accordingly performed the task with good effect in a work which he calls "the Norfolk Tour" and by occasional  reference to which I shall rescue you from a useless and overwhelming labour Indeed a judicious selection from the timeconsuming mass as to the brick and mortar baptismal and burial postroad parochial history of each county is become a  desideratum  to the traveller and will answer to him a much better purpose than the dreary and torpid detail of fiefs beruites c c and though you will always hear less from me of who was in fee or demifee whether the antipathies or the affections of the descendants struck them  out  of the family or kept the regular line  in  it than you will what is now actually to be seen or heard what is the face of the country and the feature moral and personal of the existing inhabitants a more interesting sort of information except to curiosityhunters and antiquarian compilers than you could derive from the most minute intelligence to be extracted from those unwieldy reporters who however have their use when a man is at home in his library but are the worst heavy luggage abroad that a traveller can take with him either in his head or his portmanteau  Indeed without sending them forward in a baggage waggon in which the details of this single county would make no slight figure there would be no taking them at all and then they would be found such dead weight that even antiquarians and curiosityhunters would wish they had left them with the moths on their shelves though I say my dear Baron you will find me more zealous to give you the living figure than the dead letter in continuation of my former plan I will endeavour to collect even from these Giants of our Press as well as from their "brief abstracts" and convey to your mind clear and accurate accounts of what so far as I have the honour to be your Guide it may be pleasant or useful for you to know  It seems generally admitted that Camden's character of Norfolk though written more than two centuries ago will in most of the features that distinguish it be found a true likeness at this moment that the soil is more various than that of any other county of England comprehending all the sorts that are to be found in  the island arable pasture meadow woodlands light sandy grounds deep clays heaths and fens The agriculture of the country has received such astonishing improvements since the time of the above writer that the scene immediately before the eye will exhibit every thing to you in the most rich abundant and favourable light and although the resemblance of objects are still to be recognized yet it is as the similitude of a youth with much of his wildness much of his rudeness and most of his unformed awkwardness about him and the same being strengthened by time invigorated by maturity meliorated by discipline and fertilized by a wise wholesome and improving education as necessary to the fruits of the earth in these fallen ages at least as to the creatures who move upon its surface  Norfolk is one of our maritime counties nearly of an oval form and so surrounded by water that except at a small causeway near Lopham it is an island The British Ocean forms its boundary on the North and East for near an hundred miles on the South it is  divided from Suffolk by the river Waveney and the Little Ouse According to the Roman divisions it was part of the  Iceni  in the Saxon arrangement it made a certain proportion of the East Angles Ptolemy called it  Simeni  and the modern name Norfolk or  Northernfolk  is by way of distinction from Suffolk or the  Southernfolk  In point of magnitude it has been estimated at about one thirtyfifth part of England pays according to Spelman twentytwo parts of the landtax raised in GreatBritain to the poor in  his  time of the rising scale of  modern taxation  we shall have occasion to speak hereafter £ and contains an area of acres or ¼ square English miles each being acres It is divided into hundreds in which are one city four burghs market towns and about villages in these are reckoned houses  To many continental travellers I am aware that this will seem as a contracted span of earth in comparison of the scale on which they are able to measure  ground  against us I  am fully sensible of the  small  spot my fellowislanders occupy and that we are limited in point even of cultivated possessions to less  terra firma  than Germany could very well afford to throw from some of her petty principalities yea and feel herself relieved a few of her longextended tracts of unyielding sand and heathgrounds would tell in point of numbers against the whole of our landed property It is not therefore most certainly from diameter or circumference we can presume to approach  you  my dear friend and still less the inhabitants of some other countries We must submit length and breadth to most of the nations both in and out of Europe but in the  use we have made of our little  "ALBION o'er thee profusely Nature showers  Her gifts with livelier verdure decks thy soil  With ev'ry mingled charm of hill and dale  Mountain or mead hoar cliff and forest wide  And thine the Ruins where rapt Genius broods  In pensive haunts romantic rifled towers  That beetling o'er the rock rear the grey crest  Embattled and within the secret glade  Conceal'd the abbey's ivymantled pile  Each silvan scene mild or of grace severe  That charms with loveliest interchange is thine  O FAVOUR'D ISLE"  SOTHEBY's beautiful Poem through parts of North and South Wales  in whatever  most essentially tends to the accommodation the energies the comforts and the genius of man we may assert with the sacred Writer that "we have a goodly heritage and that the lines are fallen to  us  in pleasant places" On this text I remember long since to have met with the most interesting arguments to prove we ought not simply to be content with the  general  dispensations of Providence but be impressed with particular gratitude for being born in the country which  we  inhabit and to pour forth the tribute to Him who is the great benefactor of all the nations of the earth and the instructor of all the beings who cultivate its productions My memory retains nothing but what extremely interests my heart yet my heart itself must forget all it has appreciated ere it  loses one trace of the emotions called forth by the sentiments in the discourse alluded to which pointed out the  motives  of my gratitude for being a native and inhabitant of GreatBritain I was infinitely touched by the passage which reminded me that if it were permitted me to rise so high as to see from some sublime elevation all the kingdoms of the earth roll under my eye I should feel a disposition to prefer upon the whole this in which I dwell I should bless the great Appointer that my country is not one of those  burning lands "where the heaven over head is brass and the earth under the feet iron"  and where the sun rises more like a strong man to destroy than a bridegroom coming out of his chamber to make men rejoice Nor yet one of those  frozen  parts of the universe where the lord of it reserves his treasures of snow and hail nor amongst those dreadful climes where whirlwinds and earthquakes thunder lightning and the desolating hurricane destroy all the hopes of man where the bolt of heaven breaketh the cedar and shakes the wilderness to its foundation  nor where contagion has fixed her polluted throne and the pestilence hath its commission to depopulate whole nations at a stroke but that it has pleased Providence to allow me the breath of life in a country whose advantages are upon the whole the first in the world he has bestowed on us an island guarded by the ocean and open to all the treasures of every shore a land productive of corn herbs timber and fruits watered with the most genial dews of heaven feeding innumerable springs and wells and navigable rivers a land that maintains on its surface cattle fowls flocks dairies hives and a thousand of classes labouring for its blessed inhabitants and from whose very bowels you may dig innumerable articles for daily use natural advantages these without speaking of acquired wonders from the improved state of husbandry trade building learning and the other benefits and ornaments of the country  Nor are these all The author in a style of the like chaste simplicity the truest constituent of the sublime passed I remember to other  causes  why  we should render the fervid thanks of our hearts for being born to the goodly heritage of Britain particularly for the civil liberty we enjoy  And not without good reason The life of the meanest of us my friend is so protected by the law that in the heat of the day after the labourer has mowed half an acre of grass he may  securely  lie down and refresh himself by sleep at the end of the swathes or should any daring hand invade his life either his fellowservant the master who hired him or the King of his country his blood would be required of the murtherer by the hand of the magistrate O ye despots wheresoever ye have fixed your hateful empire attend and blush at your usurpations those usurpations which first made the poor worms ye have trod upon raise themselves to your crest and seize your throats Here no man can keep back the hire of the labourers who have reaped his fields The poorest subject is absolute lord of his little all the ploughman may leave his coat at the land's end and the gleaner trust her bread and  her bottle and her scanty sheaf on the green balk THE LAW OF ENGLAND IS AS A FIRE ROUND ABOUT THEM  These assertions are admitted and confirmed by an illustrative passage of Mr MORITZ from whose Tour I quoted for you in the addenda of my last  "When we here see" observes the generous stranger "how in this happy country the lowest and meanest member of society thus unequivocally testifies the interest which he takes in every thing of a public nature when we see that a carter a common tar or a scavenger is still a man nay an Englishman and as such has his rights and privileges defined and known as exactly and as well as his King or as his King's minister it is impossible not to feel very differently affected from what we are when staring at our soldiers in their exercises at BERLIN"  The freedom too of the lowliest man is established He lives where he pleases toils where he chooses and the charities when he can toil no longer are at hand to relieve his sickness and to smooth the pillow of his age In many countries we both of us know but too well the breaths strength health and labour of the poor are appropriated the very life of the vassal is at the will of his lord there the subordinate classes of society have no property they are  themselves  property the slaves of the higher orders who buy and sell them as part of the live stock on their estates How many countries are there I have sojourned in some which resemble a large jail a house of bondage in which the chains of some are of iron and those of others are of gold but all is slavery and as our delightful Yorick says "it is a bitter portion"  Is it not then with heartfelt truth that Englishmen exclaim"O happy people O blessed country" It is true that the Demon of war has drawn his sword and is still thirsting for blood but your garners afford in the midst of an almost famished universe all manner of store your sheep bring forth tens of thousands on your yet unmolested plains you may be objects of envy but not of plunder Your wives your children your property your lives your religion are yet your own  For all these beatitudes O friend of my heart and for numberless more though I trust I have publicly borne testimony that I have travelled off all little nationalities that I  have had an eye to see and a heart to feel all the  goodness  and the  good  of other lands and that I am by no means blind or insensible to the frailties and imperfections of my own as I shall in the course of our correspondence have occasion to evince yet for all the blessings above enumerated I praise the GOD of empires him who to use the inspired language of the prophet instructed the ploughman to open and break the clods of our generous earth make smooth her surface cast her wheat her rye and barley in the places appointed for them and own that he has indeed given to me and to my countrymen a goodly heritage  You are hastening to share it with me my heart of hearts shall welcome you and  your  heart of hearts shall then bear record of the truths I am telling you  LETTER VI  NORTH RUNCTON  August    NOTWITHSTANDING my enthusiastic love of nature's beauty whether blooming over the earth in flowers expanding in billows on the sea dimpling in streams or breathing along the valleys you are not now to be told that all these are subordinate in my scale of things estimable to the beauty of the human mind neither the graces not the glorious vegetation nor the skies by which they are canopied nor even the blessed orb in whose rays they all rejoice can furnish so rich a harvest as this where the soil is naturally good and has been well cultivated  Let this sentiment prepare you for a gleaning of mental excellence the object of which has presented itself since my last  Previously to taking a wider range and while I am yet stationary at the smiling abode of my friends excursing in morning rides or evening walks permit me to shew you objects which not only rapid travellers but many who have their dwellings amongst them pass over unnoticed either because they are too near their eyes or because having seen them so often they now cease to see them at all It will form part of my pleasure also and I cannot but think it will make an ingredient in yours to draw for you occasionally as our pausingplaces may allow some of the  intellectual  features of my country without which you can catch no real likeness of it  mind  being the vital part of every just portrait That of England from my pencil can be but a sketch I have promised however to make it a true one The light delicacy indeed which finishes while it seems but to sketch is the point to be endeavoured and this I will attempt At present I wish to make you partaker of as Arcadian an evening as ever  could  have graced the Utopian dominions had they really been on the map of the world  You already know from my former report that this villa is in the midst of a garden yet the happiness which last night sat as a guest within derived little of its charm from that circumstance and little from the unnumbered sweets that embalmed the air and carried fragrance into every apartment that was opened to receive it No my friend it was of a kind that had the dwelling been situated on a barren heath and offered no better accommodation than is to be found in the hut of an unpoetical modern shepherd it would have elevated your mind your feelings above the influence of external circumstance nay it would have exalted to a felicitous height every mind not meaner than the hut not more steril than the heathground This interesting enjoyment was derived from the innocent effusions and unfoldings of nature in one of her fairest and best works the mind of a lovely girl just old enough to be yet called truly a work of nature pure as the flowrets that sprang around her cottage  The party was composed of six persons most of whom are known to you The worthy  unassuming Fanny R***** whom neither indulgence or affection could ever spoil nor rigour or ingratitude alienate My worthy friend and his wife who offer to their guests besides the good things which hospitality provides "the feast of reason and the flow of soul" a French emigrant general officer  Le Baron de PUJOI  whose private virtues even had they not been endeared by misfortune are sufficiently numerous to counterbalance the injury done to us by his professional bravery when duty raised his sword against that nation which is now his shield to him must be added your correspondent and the blooming hope of my host and hostess the interesting Sophia  As the last mentioned of these furnished the intellectual part of the evening's entertainment you will receive with pleasure a sketch of her person And yet I know you are such a champion for general symmetry in the works of nature that were I to delineate only the  mind  of Sophia you would give the correspondent form and features averring that to be in natural harmony a wellorganized mind must be placed in a wellorganized body And perhaps you would not be very far from the truth for although it occasionally happens that the mental gem is enclosed in a sorry casket and so  vice versa  there is much more frequently a due proportion and symmetry of the interior and exterior of the human oeconomy and  that  independent on all modes of education and habits of life But admitting the full influence of these when I tell you that the custom of Sophia from her earliest age in her little rambles through the garden or fields have been to stray from her servants or mother in order to cull such flowers weeds shells or pebbles as were remarkable either in the tint colouring or texture for a certain delicacy when I observe to you that she would select these from innumerable others more shewy more generally attracting and which would have been the choice of most children if for instance roses were to form part of her collection they would  be chiefly in bud or slightly blown or if any more strongly tinted shrubs or gaudier flowers were admitted it would be by way of contrast and they would be thrown by her little fingers in the backgroundWere I in addition to these facts to assure you that flaunting or vulgar flowers would never be seen in her hand and that in all her  arrangements  she discovered the like delicacy of taste that moreover her selection of playmates was but a more animated continuation of this delicacy prefering the gentle to the rude the pensive to the romping that her infant affections shewed the same bias among her feathered and animal favourites which were ever the more endeared to her in the proportion as they stood in need of her protection that their wants their sickness or their little sorrows would have more of her notice than their prosperity health or sports a bird in full song and a lamb in full frolic would be neglected were but an invalid wren beside them to claim her careshould I join to this the information that every sound of her voice from its most whispered note to "the  top of its compass" is music in all its variations would you not exclaim  Sophia's person  MUST  be as delicate as her soul  In truth a first sight of this lovely girl would determine the most timid disciple of Lavater to associate congenial affections and a mind in keeping with the almost aërial lightness of her form her sylphid movements her heavenblue eyes contour of face redundance of lightbrown hair playing round it lips of softened ruby and alternations of the lily and the rose in her complexion  I who have had opportunities of watching the opening and progression of her mind and person almost from her birth could propose a question to philosophers as to the longdisputed thesis of  innate ideas  Sophia began to be a nurse to the sick a friend to the sorrowful a separater of the delicate from the garish beauties of nature before she had either time or opportunity to imitate either of her parents who might otherwise have been successfully taken for her models  Forgive me then ye who have adopted your  great master's opinion that the human mind is but as a sheet of white paper to be afterwards filled up in the nursery the school and the world forgive me if I trace or attempt to trace certain manifestations of soul in the early dawn of human life to pure  nature  unassisted by any thing below the sun We may perhaps meet with illustrations as we proceed  Sophia is now hastening to her ninth year was herself but a visitor being at the cot only for the holidays which were indeed so near their end that the promise of a supernumerary week was to be considered as a loan borrowed from study and added to her halfyear's jubilee For though Sophia has no objection to study she is too much a child of nature to reconcile easily to stated forms and periods of learning and too much genius for lessons not of her own choosing  When your correspondent entered the subjects were literally shifting "from grave to gay from lively to severe" In all these Sophia took a ready part mixing a woman's wisdom with a child's simplicity without which  the wisdom of youth is either premature and therefore must have an early check and produce at last but a dwarf's understanding at the age of an adult or it degenerates into cunning and is fruitful only in mischief  It had been a day of event to our Sophia Early in the morning several of her nurselings among the poultry had called upon her compassion the last brood of chickens required unusual care With sadness in her looks she brought one of them into the parlour and she told us it had died in the night for which she reproached the hen whom she had seen peck at it while it stood languishing before the mother as she past clucking along with the rest of her brood "What an unnatural parent" exclaimed Sophia running to caress her own Another she said looked as if it were dying and on being told that many creatures particularly a hen which is not saying much for the animal creation by the bye would sometimes kill an invalid of its own species nay of its own family to save the trouble of nursing the indignant colour rose to her cheek and she  hurried off the dead to succour the dying The latter was indeed in as unpromising a state as a valetudinarian could well be found a downcast head drooping wing ruffled plumage or rather down closed eyes and feeble twitter Its protectress breathed upon it warmed it in her hand dipt its feverish bill in wine and cradled it in her bosom In recompence of these good offices it seemed to revive opened its eyes and picked up some of the crumbs which Sophia had spread for it on the table Thus recovered she returned it to te mother with a charge to treat it more kindly yet the first news of the morning was that her  protegé  was no more She left the breakfasttable without answering the intelligence any other way than by running for the deceased which she brought in the hollow of a hand shaped by beauty and after desiring the company to bid it good bye for ever took it into her own gardena little slip of ground in the angle of the shrubbery where she has not only a nursery but a place of burialexhibiting as she moved slowly along a figure that would exactly  have suited the angel of pity scarcely seeming to want the wings which for the sake of meeting the popular idea of angelic forms a painter might perhaps have fixed on her beautiful shoulders  But what is most to be admired in these her mental developements is that the objects which call them forth occupy for the time her whole soul and no miser was ever more earnest to add a guinea to his store or to  see  it deposited in the strong box and shining on the brooding heap than is this little girl to add one comfort to the Being under her care She cannot on sad occasions be averted from her pensioner till she has done her utmost to serve it Its welfare seems to annihilate every promise or profession that enriched the preceding moment this proves it to be  genuine  proves it to be the pure and unelaborated operation of the heart In discoursing with her dollsand I have heard her give them very sage advice and most serious lectures and reproofs on the propriety of their conduct and reform of their mannersin the burial of a sparrow or a chicken  it would be impossible until the ceremonies are over to call off her mind to any thing else however pleasurable although on joyful occasions such as the high health of any creature she has domesticated or any gay vision of fancy she has createdand she creates thousands in an hourshe will seize a new object though but an insect on the carpet and convert that into a very substantial amusement and this also is an ingredient in the  genuine  of her character A sage's steady wisdom without a child's volition and simplicity is a bad omen but the degree of her gravity is proportioned to the object for example the loss of her feathered favourites had been preceded by the supposed death of a fourfooted friend whom she ha  known and loved the greatest part of her life and his fate was thought to be aggravated by several circumstances The morning after this supposed disaster our child of impulse followed her affectionate feelings by appearing in suitable habiliments sable ribbons graced her arms and a black collar encircled her neck Not contented with this she invested the little  Juliet also Romeo's only surviving daughter with correspondent mourning in which the pathetic black crape was as liberally made use of It was the unaided suggestion of a heart alive to every sentiment and action of tenderness and the friend of every living thing at an age when too many children are the little tyrants of all within their reach  I said  supposed  death because it turned out that the Destinies were pleased to extend the thread of poor Romeo's life even to the date at which I am writing The honest fellow is now sleeping at my feet under my writing table and was amongst the old associates who awaited me here and who in his reception of me did not seem to forget that I was a friend to dogs in general and to him in particular His escape from the Power "that putteth all things under his feet" would seem too marvellous for any persons not gifted with a faith enlarged enough for Bruce and Robinson Crusoe Perhaps certain critics who measuring the powers of all other beings by the partial scale of their own observations determine the point at which  the progressions of instinct by the help of education  must  stop and thereupon make a liberal use of the censorial words  absurd unnatural impossible  perhaps I say dear friend some of these in their allwise decisions may add the name of the GLEANER to those rightwonderful travellers for there are I find who dispute the ingenuity and accomplishments of his poor Canary the sagacity of his travelling Steed though by all the powers of nature he swears he has acted but the part of a faithful historian to both these honest and ingenious creatures and if his heart has now and then thrown its most glowing effusions over their actions and characters and sometimes called on Fancy for a decoration that although it embellishes does not injure or conceal the sacred lineaments of Truth what but a cold and Cynic caviller will quarrel with a description that gives to an innocent and interesting object its full power of pleasing  Sweet Bijou honest Surefoot farewell your genius and your adventures have drawn the sigh of sympathy from many a generous  bosom and your  true  story shall be long dear to reason to feeling and the heart not from merit in your historian but from the transactions he records  Notwithstanding this and notwithstanding also that the extraordinary and fictiousseeming events in the preservation of Romeo might be attested  I had the pleasure of hearing them attested since these Letters were sent to you by General H****** who has frequently seen as extraordinary feats archieved by Birds as have been related of my poor Canary Indeed you know they might be attested by almost any man in Germany  by as faithworthy beings as ever boregwitness to the truth the particulars of this matter shall stand over to our next meeting  Let us return to the sweet Sophia to detail the infinity of glee with which she sported over some observations on domestic happiness as she saw it subsist between the amiable pair to whom she belonged to mark the  naïvéte  with which she felicitated the husband on the treasure of such a wife while the blisso'erflowing eyes of the former confirmed the truth of her  remarks to describe the affection with which she divided herself among the whole party now wishing passionately that each individual might be blest with each other's society through life and undivided by death now hoping that after living an hundred years in unbroken amity all present might occupy one grave and then looking on this as impossible while she placed the happy couple and herself in one and the Lady the General and the Gleaner in another would be a vain attempt the image of death assuming its usual terrors she returned to the chearing idea of protracted life and protested with all the fervour though without the oath of uncle Toby and without knowing there had been an uncle Toby or an oath  that none of the groupe should die  but that GOD ALMIGHTY would keep them upon earth a long long time to love each other and afterwards permit them all to meet in Heaven and there live together for ever  It were in vain you are aware to expect the effect of this description on your mind should at all equal that which was produced by the  object described because a great share of the impression and interest grew out of looks and actions far beyond the reach of written language and to give the mere words without these where each of those actions and looks was grace beauty and innocence unsullied by the world and free from the pertness or hoyden freedoms of a spoiled child is to offer you but the shadow yet they may give you an interesting idea of the beautiful substance  I do not however place it before you as a partial selection to serve as a portrait of a little favourite nor as a specimen of the grace and talents of English children in preference to any I have observed in other countries but I bring it forward in some sort to strengthen the ground on which I shall presume to dissent from those who maintain the impossibility of innate ideas of any kind In the contemplation of this lovely girl and a few others I have been strangely puzzled to know from whence if not from some such ideas can have proceeded the eager pursuit and  choice  of whatever is most delicate or graceful and the neglect or rejection of their  contraries at an age when the discrimination of colours or the determinations of fashion upon them cannot possibly have been the result of tuition or that earnest curiosity or that imitative power which at a certain stage of youth are such wonderous helps to the opening mind From the age of three to five or six curiosity must be the chief engine of knowledge but it cannot teach in matters of taste the superior delicacy and interest of a flower tinted faintly or with too much strength for our idea or feeling of the delicate or regulate a child in the choice of a shrub or shell which in its leaf or blossom formation or mark bears the like characteristic  The selector is of too tender an age to comprehend the distinction or the definition of delicacy even were the mother or governess to explain it now as similar reasoning will go to a number of other early propensions of human beings in their choice either of the elegant and delicate or the tawdry and glaring it will at least support me in a query submitted to learning and candour whether we must not necessarily  refer these preferences to some  inborn delicacy  or  coarseness  of the infant mind whether we must not consider them as dictates of pure nature seeing they are antecedent to all instruction and imitation Be this as it may you will agree with me in believing that from whatever source these propensions are derived they "grow with our growth and strengthen with our strength"  In one of the cases indeed a change may take place the youth who in childhood appeared attached to the gaudy and garish may sometime be taught a better taste but it will scarce ever happen that an infant admiration of the delicate and gentle will lose any of its relish for those graces of Nature much less be exchanged for their reverse on the contrary they almost always form into principles and habits which as life proceeds will influence a mature person in whatever are the proper objects of them I think indeed it would be difficult to adduce a single instance even as an exception where either the man or woman who in childhood discovered a bias towards the abovementioned  graces of Nature was forced either by bad culture or worse associations into a total dereliction of what must have once afforded them so many delightful sensations the very memory of which will be endeared  If therefore instead of being repressed these dawning indications of permit me to call it a  natural  good taste are fostered and encouraged of what progress are they not capable and what avenues of bliss in thought and action do they not open to their possessor  Did you ever  hear  of a being who had the impulses of the child that has led to this train of reflection turning out an inelegant I had almost said an immoral woman A very great perversion of what I have ventured but not presumptuously to consider as  innate ideas  of the GENTLE and DELICATE must have expelled them from their native residence in the juvenile bosom before this degeneracy can happen Bad tuition may do much evil communications yet more towards dislodging the angel guests from their proper mansion but as both education and example instead of unlearning will  sanction and confirm what pure nature has taught I shall consider it a more arduous task to change the flowergarden in which stands the abode of Sophia into a morass and the salutary air that breathes fragrance around it into "a pestilential congregation of vapours" than to see any noxious weed of folly or poisonous plant of vice if you will allow me to proceed with the florid image I first took hold of encumber the fair soil and rob of its natural fruit the mind now opening upon the maternal eye and upon her own innocent heart a Paradise of sweets  Just as I had written the last passage the blooming subject of it tripped up stairs to my chamber in the way to her own to bid me after all the little adventures of the day and evening good night The animation of genial discourse had kept her beautiful eyes unclosed and unfatigued many hours beyond that of her usually seeking and  finding  repose for in the bloom of youth health spirits and innocence what should invade her slumbers But as it had been a day of enterprize so had it been  an evening of indulgence and under the charm of that youth those spirits and that innocency the Hours seemed to have thought their own wings too heavy and to have borrowed the lighter pinions of the moments Sophia found me at my writingtable and having in the morning presented her with a little book partly extracted from the Letters which at your wish I have continued in this correspondence she desired to know if I were making any more Gleanings then without waiting any reply she repeated her caresses and adieus and as she tripped to the door to join her maid said "Well GOD bless you I wish you would glean me and what an odd little thing you would make of me" I stepped to her chamber door to inform her I had done so and I had not a doubt the friend to whom I was writing would thank me for it  Returning to my table I felt strongly inclined to close what I had said concerning her with some wishes of peculiar kindness But I knew not what to wish  Oh thou unspotted by the world the  genuine thought the natural heart the generous impulse the fancy that though it has the rapidity of light never imagined guile the pure word and the alabaster deed these dear innocent are already thinewhat then is there to wish what to pray for thee what but the  continuance  of these treasures these beatitudes Yes their continuation will be a foretaste of Heaven and of "the best loved angels there" Fountain of purity continue them and now without apology I bid  you  my dear friend farewell  P S Since writing the above the holiday Jubilee is ended Sophia has returned to her  school  However well the seminary may be conducted it is like every other a long passage into the temple of general society I repeat therefore with yet greater energy and fervour the prayer that closed my letter But I mentioned the presentation of a book to my little friend in some measure connected with a former correspondence suffer me to add the lines which accompanied it they in a manner incorporate with the subject  To SOPHIA with "PITY'S GIFT"  Presented by Command  POETS can hear or fancy that they hear  Seraphic symphonies distinct and clear  Hence Pity's voice as here I bent my way  Her "Gift" perusing said or seemed to say  "Mortal that little book immediate bear  To C's cotI have a nurs'ry there  Lay it on Sophy's breast 'tis Pity's shrine  The off'ring yoursthe inspiration mine  My handmaid she elected at her birth  To prove my  representative  on earth"  The Goddess said her orders I obey  And on her handmaid's breast the off'ring lay  LETTER VII  LYNN  August    As upon all occasions I feel a pleasure in praising and a sincere reluctance to withhold praise it is some mortification that I cannot agree with the Tourist who has called this a  beautiful  town though I am ready to allow the application of his other epithets namely that it is rich and populous nor will I deny that its situation near the fall of the Ouse into the sea is highly favourable to the extention of its trade which is thus conducted into no less than eight different counties opening thereby as many channels for the produce of our own and other shores  By whatever road you enter this seaport my dear Baron you will be impressively struck with its general resemblance to some of your own German and many French fortified  towns Its neat quicksets on each side the road as you enter by the South gate the gate itself the deep rampartlooking elevation the entrenched ditch by which it is encompassed on the land side the platform of cannonry the formal militarylooking walks terrace fashion and the fragment of ancient wall with the various old buildings in  keeping  with this picture of a foreign fortress will all bring  home  to your recollection Indeed it is almost impossible to offer an Englishman a juster idea of the usual style of a continental town or a foreigner any one more resembling what he has been accustomed to see than by referring him to a view of Lynn I wish I could extend the resemblance between this and many of the French or German  Even when there was not a single turnpike in the country the Norfolk roads were naturally so good that when our King Charles was its visitor in he said the county should be cut into strips to make roads for the rest  public roads but  there  it falls off importantly on the part of the two former the turnpike road to Lynn in almost every  direction but especially near the little village I have lately drawn for you being so beautiful that I am not sure whether the most national traveller would not overlook the similitude of the town to any one in his own land in his admiration of the paths that lead to it And the cultivated scenery which variegates the prospect as he passes along though somewhat contrasting the warbreathing spirit of bastions and battlements by displaying a specimen of the smiling progress of modern agriculture gives that assemblage of the rich and the agreeable which are seldom  completely  associated but in the landscapes of England  As you advance towards Lynn however this scenery gives way to various circumstances which more assimilate to Holland the meadows are on each side separated rather by the ditch and the drain than by hedgerows the soil flattens upon the eye the marshy earth appears to sink under the feet of the herds that browze it but the verdure is lovely and the pasture abundant  You will very soon perceive in this as in  every other part of England vestiges of the religion which for so many ages and in so many regions of the earth prevailed and which indeed still maintains its ground though it seems at present to be  trembling  ground in various parts of Europe Catholicism however in this island is now rather permitted than encouraged she is confined to the contracted chapel or even to temporary edifices yet more limited where she is privileged by the courtesies of the country to rear her altar strew her incense wreathe her garlands and chaunt her oraison But her magnificent pile that expanded widely its commanding powers her consecrated grounds that appropriated and encircled half a district within its walls and took whole villages in its gripetill Ceres and Pomona were compelled to become tributary not only by surrender of their first fruits but their lasther "cloudcapt towers and solemn temples" are to be seen amongst us no more Of her former grandeur and of her once almost immeasurable power we trace no longer the trophies but the tombs her disjointed monastry  her ivygirded ruin her proud abbey converted into huts for the herdsman or stalls for the ox and her most secret places where the penitent breathed her confession embraced her punishment or received her pardon amidst hymns that seemed to penetrate her soul now all changed to the asylum of the bat and to receive only the vespers of the nightbird  We retain however the names of numberless Saints even in our churches and the Cross is frequently seen displayed at the top of our Protestant Temples thus the principal church in Lynn which is said to have been built about the year by HERBERT DE LOZINGA Bishop of Norwich  The etymology of this Prelate's name does not come out much to the justice of his character Camden says that the word  leasing  in Saxon signifies a  lye  or  trick  for  which reason  Bishop Herbert had the surname of Lozinga and it seems to be admitted by all writers that the character of his youth and old age contrasted each other When young say his biographers he was loose wild and usurious in  three years  he grew so rich as to purchase the abbey of Winchester and the bishoprick of Thetford for which he was stigmatized by William of Malmsbury as the  Vir Pecuniosus  When old nothing of Herbert was in Herbert laudably adopting and it it said often repeating the words of St Hierom  erravimus juvenus emendemus senes  To atone for the former Pope Paschal II commanded him to build monasteries and churches all of which adds my intelligencer on this subject he performed  religiously  erecting besides St Margaret's at Lynn and several others the  Cathedral of Norwich and a Palace for himself  I will not withhold however the candid reflections which have been brought forth as a settoff against his former simoniacal practices In criticising says his advocate the founder of so many magnificent edifices if we admit that he really acquired great riches by the means of servility and flattery it was much to his honour and we hope a full expiation of the frailties of a courtier that he applied them not to the vain purposes of an  useless  and  ostentatious  display of human power and greatness but in the infinitely more commendable pursuit of erecting such magnificent monuments of piety as promise to be the admiration of ages yet to come and howsoever he might acquire the surname of  Lozinga  or be called  Vir Pecuniosus  which is  now  no stigma at all we think that the private virtues and public charities of his riper years were such as in more modern times would have been esteemed sufficient to atone for a multitude of the follies of youth  is dedicated to St Margaret  who is the titulary Saint and Patroness of the Town it is also curious enough to give you a scrap of superstition that attaches to the history of this Virgin She is reported to have conquered a fierce Dragon with a Cross so the good men of Lynn have no less than  three  dragons' heads  each  wounded with a cross for the Town Arms This is by way of compliment and the effigies of the patroness are impressed on the public seal She is standing in a right victorious posture wounding and treading this same dragon under foot with a Latin inscription too which no doubt must be very pleasing to her and an ancient man whom I conversed with on the subject assures me that the dragon tipifies  the devil himself  Saint NICOLAS  It is asserted that Norfolk has the greatest number of parish churches of any in the three kingdoms and if as is stated it contains ¾ square miles or acres and inhabitants it is persons to every mile and it being supposed that one person out of every nine or ten is able to bear arms the county and city have men so qualified So long ago as the musterroll contained names but at this moment when every man is a patriot soldier the defensive power of the county must be encreased in proportion  has likewise some sacred honours assigned him in his chapel which was erected in the reign of our third Edward but I can glean nothing to distinguish him from the sainthood in general St James indeed whose chapel  was demolished with others at the dissolution exhibits a circumstance more honourable to him than if he had to boast a priory in all the pomp and ceremonies of monastic dignity By a liberal benefaction of the mayor burgesses and inhabitants this dismantled edifice was rebuilt in to serve as a  charity  for fifty decayed old men women and poor children where a comfortable endowment is made for their work instruction and maintenance and for putting out the children to honest employments of late great additions we are told have been made and St JAMES's chapel is become the general workhouse  Of the various religious houses or priories which once flourished in this town there remains nothing so perfect as a hexagon steeple of the Gray Friars near this workhouse  of the whole town  Should you ever happen to be here in February you would see a something that a little resembles one of your German Fairs in what they call the Lynn Mart but the new walk or mall which has so extremely a French air  is in the blooming season really worth your observation What follows I have tried by the test of the living eye and find the descriptions accurate as well of this as some surrounding objects concerning which as there is nothing new to be said I retain what seems to me worth preserving of the old This public promenade is about yards long and eleven wide between the quick hedges At convenient distances on each side are semicircular recesses in the verdure sufficient to receive twenty people on each bench Upon a gentle ascent on the right is a plantation and shrubbery at the bottom of which winds a stream and at the end of the shrubbery is a small plantation of lime trees intermingled with Scotch firs whence there is a good view of Lynn and the adjacent villages where wood water modern buildings and ancient ruins form a various and interesting prospect  About half way between the South and East gates stand the remains of an ancient oratory with several vaults and cavities under ground over which are some dark cells for the priests to  take confessions and above them a small chapel in the figure of a cross arched and enriched with carvings it is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and commonly called the Lady's or the Red Mount whither Romish penitents in their pilgrimage to the holy wells and monastery of our Lady at Walsingham used to resort and perform their devotions  Of this Lady of WALSINGHAM we shall have further to speak as we proceed She was indeed  in her way  a lady of ladles and did we continue to be proud of what we once boasted in this stile my good protestant Baron the atchievements of this wonderworking dame might be pitted against even the longfamous Lady of LORETTO  Meantime you are not to think the Lynn monastics lived and died by thousands without leaving behind them any trace more useful than the nodding fragment and desolated wall for it is recorded that of these thousands two holy men had mortal life to some social purpose the one a Franciscan Friar saith the annalist an excellent musician mathematician and  astrologer bred at Oxford after having applied his studies chiefly to astronomy by the help of his astrolabe made five voyages to the North seas In the first he sailed from Lynn to Iceland with company whom he left on the seacoast while he travelled up into the island in search of discoveries He presented his charts of the northern seas at his return to Edward III in the year and they were afterwards made use of in the reign of Henry IV Chaucer had a great esteem for him stiling him Frere Nicholas Linn a Reverend Clerk He is said to have wrote a book of Discoveries The other  made Indexes  to  Thirtythree Writers  But what are a pair of Monks This town we are told has been honoured with the visits and favours of fifteen royal personages Let us see whether any of these have bequeathed "the good men of Lynn" any better legacy than the Reverend Clerk who wrote the book of Discoveries or the enduring Carmelite  who made Indexes to thirtythree Writers  Yes one of them presented the corporation  with an elegant double gilt embossed and enamelled cup and cover weighing seventythree ounces and holding a full pint which is well preserved and upon all public occasions and entertainments used with some uncommon ceremonies at drinking the health of the King or Queen and whoever goes to visit the mayor drinks sack out of this cup He also it is said then gave them  from his own side  a sword with a silver mounting to be carried before the mayorthere's for youbut as the charter dated September in the sixth year of this King's reign calls him prepositus or provost a title not clearly defined it has been denied that King John granted the town a mayor but that it had one in the last year of his reign is evident from his letters patent dated June directed  Screw your expectations then to their proper bent and proceed Flourish kettledrum and trumpet for a circumstance that calls upon the most chaste fidelity and minute historical circumspection is at hand My friend you are no doubt prepared Read on  KING JOHN GAVE THIS SWORD TO THE MAYOR AND GOOD MEN OF LYNN  Bishop Gibson in his addition to Camden observes that this sword which by the inscription is  said  to have been given by KING JOHN was really the gift of KING HENRY the VIII after the town came into his possession and he changed their burgesses into aldermen and granted them several privileges The charter granted by King John does not mention the sword but that granted by Henry expressly says  "he granted them a sword to be carried before their mayor"  A loose paper of Sir Henry Spelman's dated September says one THOMAS KENET townclerk of LYNN assured him to compose an inscription to be engraved upon the plain hilt of the townsword as above stated "KING JOHN gave this sword to the town" hereupon he caused the person who gave this information and was then his scholar to write these words  Ensis hic Donum fuit Regis Johannis  A suo ipsius latere datum  IN ENGLISH  King John took this sword from  his own side  and gave it to this town  which the swordbearer carried to Mr Cooke a Goldsmith who engraved it upon one side of the hilt If this story be true the inscription of which the town so much boasts is of no authority On the other side of the hilt is  vivat Rex Henerîcus octavus Anno Regeni sui    The gentlemen of the corporation insist that the sword now borne before the mayor  was  given by King John and has been used for that purpose from the time of Henry III and that when some kings have honoured the town with their presence the  mayors themselves  have carried this sword before them "and it is remarkable" says Mr Mackerell "that in a window on the north side of the choir near the altar of St Nicholas's chapel the town arms and the sword are depicted in glass and most probably were fixed there soon after erecting the chapel and glazing the windows which is supposed to have been in the reign of Edward III between the years and  or about years after King John is said to have given the sword to the town Upon the whole it is pretty clear that the sword was given by King John but whether from his  own side  and to be carried before a provost or a mayor must still remain doubtful if there be any error in the inscription upon the sword it is in saying that King John took it from his own side thereby intimating that it was the sword he commonly wore which it is not easy to believe it not only being much too large for an offensive weapon but also like all other swords used for purposes of state by corporate bodies"  The corporation consists of a mayor recorder twelve aldermen and eighteen commoncouncil men a town clerk chamberlain c the town has sent two burgesses to parliament ever since the th of Edward I and the election is in the whole body of the freemen and freeburgesses in number about and the mayor is the returning officer  I have been the more particular in detailing to you this very great affair as I find it stated in  all  the traditions of it because you see it is extremely important whether the sword was taken from the royal side by himself or offered by the medium of a more plebeian hand Nor would I by any means have you attach any credit to the insinuation of those who dispute whether the regal personage abovementioned gave either the Cup  or  Sword for as King John is not one of our English monarchs who can afford posterity to lose even a trifling instance of his having done any thing worthy of remembrance though he was  compelled  you know by his barons to do that which remains the pride of our constitution confirm MAGNA CHARTA one would not make his little less by depriving him of even the  gilding  of a liberal action though but in the gift of a gay cup and a fine sword The more particularly as the donation seems to connect with the public benefit of granting the town of Lynn now called  Lynn Regis  Before the reformation it was called LynnEpiscopi the property of the Bishop of Norwich It retained its name of Bishop's Lynn till the time of Henry VIII who exchanging the monastery of St Bennet in the Holme and other lands for the revenues of the Bishoprick this town came into his widereceiving and no less widewastinghands and in consequence was elevated or degraded whichever you please to Lynn Regis Should you wish to have it taken higher up into the tree of etymology Camden and Spelman can help you to clamber though you will from the topmost branch of the former look down upon nothing but a cheerless pool and chilling lake which the old British word Lhyn expresses and from which it derives its name but Spelman stoutly denies this affirming that the name is LEN in Saxon a farm or tenure in fee Take which you like best my friend I cannot think there is a pin to choose between them and though I would not reject an atom of information that could either inform the head or interest the heart or even refuse to gratify curiosity with a single word or the antiquityhunter with a rusty nail on which an event or circumstance worth preserving had hung upon it but for an instant I must confess that the musty minutiae which journalists rake up of things which have neither "pith or moment" but which nevertheless they retail by the rood are amongst the disgusting historical nausea which sicken me as I read However provided we can get at some of the kernel let who will hunt after the husk These remarks by no means apply to those tourists who have endeavoured to present the heart of the nut and throw away its shell I have already shewn that Norfolk has some of those  to be a free  borough This was done on the petition of John Grey the Bishop of Norwich by  virtue of which the burgesses were to choose themselves a praetor or provost and although the good Bishop tacked to this a condition that the said provost should be  subject to the mitre  taking an oath to that end yearly and be called the  Bishop's Man  it was no doubt for one of those weighty reasons which have led the spiritual guardians of all countries and at all times to take on themselves the trouble of having a controul over temporals purely to the intent of teaching good management This part of Norfolk however was not always propitious to the princely visitant for he is said to have lost not only his baggage but his treasure in passing the marshes of Lynn in The marsh lands here spoken of form a peninsulasurrounded by navigable rivers and an arm of the seaconsisting of about acres feeding as many sheep  Several of the historians of this country mention a custom established at Lynn so long ago as called the  Feast of Reconciliation  holden the first Monday of every month when the mayor aldermen and the preachers met  to hear decide and settle in an amicable manner all controversies between man and man in order to prevent lawsuits No doubt a very commendable expedient but as this convention no longer subsists I presume the litigious  spirit  that is said in ancient days to vex the good fellowship of the county has been  quieted  but the wise ancient man I before mentioned in the case of the Saint the Devil and the Dragon said "there happened as he had heard his grandam report so many quarrelling bouts at the Feast of Amity springing from difference of opinion that they soon wanted another Reconciliation assembly to settle themselves so the lawyers took it in hand Sir" continued he "and managed the disputes of the town their own way and though we have a power of Feasts here every year there has not been one Reconciliation Feast since and somehow though we have more lawyergentry nowadays ten to one than i' my young time more than a limb of them to a street and e'en almost one to a quarrel I don't find there is more of the good thing called peace amongst  us than there us'd to be though there is twenty times the law which is to be sure another good thing you know"  My ancient man smiled and seems so curiously to have explained that I shall leave the subject to say something of the TRADE of this thriving town a very prominent feature you will allow in the portrait of all the seaports of this commercial isle Lynn deals more largely in coals and wine than any other town in England except London Bristol and Newcastle In return for these articles of merchandize imported it receives back for exportation the corn produced in the several counties which it supplies  The rest of the LYNN lions are the statue of our third William in the quadrangle marketplace with a cross and sixteenpillared dome and gallery round it the theatre and the assembly rooms the first is under the direction of a very good conducter  Mr BRUNTON  good performer and good MAN who attends even to the morals as  well as the abilities of his company which is therefore as respectable as attracting and the last are ample and commodious The Norfolk tourist has criticised its plan and construction and certainly not fastidiously but with justice yet as we have not room for the enumeration of defects for which there is none but the radical remedy and these are not my friend the times for sustaining the cost of pulling down in order to rebuild a  luxury  while every necessary article of life is almost doubled and several trebled in price by absorbing but inevitable taxation we will pass over the objections and after a short pause pursue our journey  In close of this letter accept two commercial calculations the one respecting a particular branch of the agriculture the other of its exportation  In the county of Norfolk are parishes and upon the average acres of turnips grown in each making acres the mere  hoeing  of which at s per acre amounts to l per ann consequently more than oneseventh of the county are in turnips as the total quantity  of acres in the county I have already told you are  It has been said that the four Norfolk ports export as much corn  as all the rest of England  The following extract taken from the customhouse books at Lynn is to be considered as the yearly average which has been exported to foreign markets and coastwise for the years and which were far from being greatly productive It will serve to shew you the astonishing energies of the country when scope is given for unembarrassed exertion     Quarters  Per Quarter  Amount        £  s  d  £  s  d

                   LETTER VIII  August    IT has been well observed that the minds of the English like their climate are chequered with an extraordinary variety which seems indeed to have been infused into the whole system of nature and which is most agreeable where the scene is often changing In most other countries my friend there is more of uniformity both of clime and of character In those allowing for now and then a solitary Mannerist orif you will grant me the word Whimmist there are not more distinctions of characters than of classes The two degrees of high and low with a sort of undefined intermediate body form the whole nation from the most stately order of the  premier Noblesse  to the  petite Baron  the distance of whose veins from the rich and  ichorous  blood which the  former derives from the unfathomable ocean of ancestry is regarded but as a common puddle dribbling through the system impoverishing the very spirit and unfitting him to mix a rivulet so sullied and scanty with the crimson torrent that ennobles every artery of the  first order  Nor do the subordinate arrangements upon the Continentand more especially you know in Germanythe class of merchants shoppeople and  le plus bas  differ essentially from each other A traveller for instance in a journey of a hundred miles upon your land will not only meet with duplicates and triplicates but these again four times quadrupled as like to each other as tree to tree yea as leaf to leaf even of the same  kind  of leaves It is either the august Duke the superb Marquis the stately Margrave the lofty Landgrave the courtly Count or the legitimate Baron it is either these of the first class their imitators of the second or  their  imitators of the third And so in the descending series but all in their line very much alike and on your  approach to them as little distinguishable in the interior of character as soldiers at a distance in their ranks and uniform  But a social Traveller cannot go an hundred yards on ENGLISH ground without meeting something in one person if he meets any body that separates him from another either in the  manner or the matter of his character  and it is fifty to one but the next person he encounters will shew himself off as differently as if he were of a different country even should the discourse with the first man be continued with the second  A Dutch passageboat for instance and an English stagecoach will bring this into apt illustration In the former you will find a pipe in every mouth and a long pause broken only by the necessity of changing the barge or by some solemn observation for the most part as ponderous as the vehicle in which you are drawn and stagnant as the canal whereon you soporifically move If the  great subject  as they call it Trade forces their thick and melancholy spirits through the fumes that envelop  themI speak chiefly of commercial people for I have shewn and you will admit faithfully there are very merry and light Dutchmenyea and Dutch women toothey seem to labour through their clouds and you hear but one sound upon the one theme  Gelt gelt geltMoney money moneyThat is my demand what is your offer  Half an hour after the question the breath is drawn in to negative by a nod or sent off with a puff into a fuliginous affirmative yes or no often beginning and ending the compact And one trade is the echo of another trade as similar to each other as their pipes  An English stagecoach on the contrary is usually filled with as many unimitating beings as there are places to receive them There is something peculiar and  appropriate  in every passenger whether male or female and they are not only strongly marked from each other in the casual journey that associates them for the moment but very frequently each is distinct from every other of his family The thoughts and the mode of expressing them belong exclusively  to him or to herself and though the principles of the heart whether bad or good are the same all over the world it is here chiefly that those principles are displayed in an unnumbered variety of forms I had almost said of fancy dresses even like characters at a masque according to the particular humour or disposition of the wearer  This diversity amongst us may be attributed partly to the freedom of our government which without stilting some men into giants and dwarfing others preserves the due line of gradation investing every individual with a just sense of himself and of his happy situation Of this we have instances which could scarce be credited in the less liberal arrangements of many other nations particularly where prevails the spirit that brings the whole human race soul as well as body to a size cutting off the heads of the high to level them with the low and then ludicrously insisting we are one and all of the same stature  But I conceive that the British constitution allows to every being that contributes to form  it whatever be his state or station an opportunity to  reverence himself  and though this sometimes encourages an overrated estimate it preserves upon the whole the due measure and weight civil political and religious  From whatever cause however our variegation from each other in opinion and in action arises its effect is always pleasant and often useful to a traveller It offers him in every direction of his route interesting amusive or singular companions by the way and notwithstanding the deep national reserve and coldness imputed to my countrymen and women and in which it must be owned they too often entrench themselves they may be all brought into conversation if a traveller is resolved upon it and however thick may be the ice at first setting out the chilling influence will yield by degrees a few goodnatured remarks will cheer the surface like morning sunshine on the frozen current the first subject that calls out a human affection will begin the thaw and an ingenuous exchange of those still small civilities that make up the great comforts of life will like the  noontide ray loosen yet more the stream from its impediments the warm beams of the imagination or the yet more ardent ones of the heart will break out upon it and there joining each other will melt away every remaining coldness and obstruction so as to produce a flow of good humour or good sense during the rest of the voyage or journey whether it be of a day a month or a year perhaps for the residue of the mortal travel of the parties The ice which as it were shuts up the lips and closes the heart of an Englishman to strangers whether of his own or other countries being once thus unlocked and the free current of his estimable heart disencumbered the blood that animates it flows copiously towards the being who has in this manner subdued the frost and ever after it exchanges with that being the permanent glow of friendship or of love  Much therefore depends on our taking out with us a sufficient stock of that with which you I know are always amply provided COURTESYwithout a supply of which no man  should attempt to go beyond the limit of his own gardenwalls and scarcely indeed to their extent for a gilded fly an obstructing flower an obtrusive sunbeam or a few heatdrops falling in his path might annoy and put him out of temper with heaven and earth The courtesy I write of is in truth as necessary to a traveller as his passport or his letters of credit and it will be current where all other recommendations and introductions fail It will  create  urbanity in the bosom where it was unknown before It is solid as sterling gold lighter of carriage than an English bankbill and though all Europe confesses the intrinsic value and utility of both these at home and abroad unnumbered instances have met my eye in this jarring world where an ounce of  courtesy  would have outweighed in the purchase of human happiness or human content more than our banks or treasuries could buy "A sweet word not only turneth away wrath" but it leads to knowledge to wisdom to conciliation to honour pleasure and repose It conducts to the best felicities of life and  attains the most gracious ends by the easiest means  Yet what is it but that engaging demeanour proceeding from a disposition to give and to receive what ought to be acceptable to the loftiest mind and proudest spirit What is it but to gild our home with the smile of Peace and in our excursions abroad to make the best of what we see and hear by the way Where either in a literal or social sense the road is rugged it softens its asperities by temper or forbearance and where the surface is too smooth not to be in overhaste to suppose there is no medium betwixt insult and adulation but to remember there are a thousand smooth surfaces which have not the slippery illusions of the ice though they display the polish of the mirror and often represent the true form and figure of the soul in its beauty as that mirror doth the shape and fashion of the body And even when they  have  the treachery of the ice our sliding lightly and boundingly over them when we begin to feel them breaking their fair promise may ensure our safety  In short my dear and faithful friend whereever we are constrained to travel a land barren in itself amidst the sullen silence of the brooding tempest or its stunning clamours when its vext spirit is let loose whether it be a storm of the elements over our heads or those more furious and destructive hurricanes in men's bosoms both of which every traveller on this earth  must  sometimes encounter it is even  wonderful  of what consequence is this courteous amenity It steals a sunbeam over the most gloomy parts of nature and society and adds a ray to their brightest splendours  In my former remarks I confessed that this  magic power  was more generally possessed abroad than at home It is every where however of inestimable price Like the divine quality of mercy so finely described by THE POET of our Isle it is "twice blessed"  "It blesses him that gives and him that takes" I am guilty of tautology in saying how much it is an innate of your bosom and it is I thank GOD amongst the few possessions no harsh events have yet had the power to estrange from mine  LETTER IX  HILLINGTON  August    DIVERGING from LYNN it is my intention to proceed towards the seacoast till we reach CROMER by the route of HOUGHTON FAKENHAM WALSINGHAM and HOLT I am writing this letter at the little thoroughfare village from whence I date It is just half way betwixt LYNN and the first of the abovementioned places You are prepared for and you tell me you are pleased with my custom of winding with you occasionally through alleys green and flowery nooks from the broad highway to see the  face and mind and heart  of the country in unsuspected places  "Half in a shower of clustering roses lost"  THOMSON  then return to the more ostensible paths  of happier note and every other lover of the humid earthand in truth the whole marshy pasturage may be said to  wear the willow  from the eastern gate of LYNN to HILLINGTON But the very heath grounds of England have their appropriate fertilities and one of these you will pass in your way to the place where I have now paus'd to write you cannot during the Summer ride over one of our village commons but you will observe it agreeably populated herds of cattle part standing satisfied in the refreshing pool part reposing on the verdant sod troops of horses and flocks of sheep at feed or at play enlivened by the cottage and farm with innumerous geese and other aquatic fowl exhibiting to your eye a striking contrast to the long the dreary and unprofitable wastes which you have so often traversed in Germany where perhaps a solitary goldfinch is seen waving on the thistle a gaunthorse sadly ruminating in the sand or a lean goat browzing the fern Indeed a few miles of heath or moor are to the English Traveller sometimes a relief from the abundance  and beauty of the general cultivation At the same time it must be owned we have in different parts of the island too great an extent of waste land but it is amongst the grand national improvements of the present moment to reform the face and enrich the bosom of the country by enclosure a measure which according to the report of the Committee of Agriculture will yield to the nation the enormous sum of twenty millions a year and it appears by the same calculation that the total amount of waste lands in the Empire  is    thus proportioned  England       Wales       Scotland               Your arithmetic will serve you to make the deduction hereby produced in the agricultural riches of the country from so large a portion of it lying unemployed Yet when you come to have nearer your view the almost miracles which are worked by the  little  island without  one rood of the acres being brought into the national account when you come to be an eyewitness of the spirit of commerce of fashion of elegance of luxury of private benefaction and of the magnificence of public liberality manifested not only in the metropolis but in every part of the empire your astonishment at what hitherto we  have  done could be exceeded only by that of perceiving what we continue to do and that too with a debt on the shoulders of our poor Britannia enough to weigh down Atlas The very  account  of this debt is in itself almost too mighty for the grasp of the human mind and while it displays the grand complexity of our resources seems to turn the head of the coldest calculator dizzy as he goes on to figure its still increasing progress It was even in the midsummer of £ a sum which from its magnitude has thrown even over a  description  of the means and modes of paying it an air of ridicule "It would require" says an ingenious abridger and epitomist " pounds weight in ten pound Bank notes having notes to one  pound This sum in cash if put into carts each containing lb and have two horses to draw allowing feet to each cart would load carts and cover miles in length with a remainder of carts in the th mile Were it to be laid down in guineas in a line would extend above miles in length In the national debt was millions sterling and if a man was to count shillings per minute for hours a day it would take him years days hours and minutes The whole of this sum being millions of shillings and the coinage standard being shillings in the Troy pound its whole weight will be million thousand and pounds which will require carts each to have a ton weight to convey it to any place or supposing a man could carry pound weight from London to York it would require men to perform it and if all these men were to walk in a line at only one yard distance from each other they would cover miles and a half and yards The breadth of a shilling being one inch and if all  these shillings were laid in a strait line close to one another's edge the line they would cover would be miles which is miles more than double the circumference of the globe  "Supposing the interest of this sum to be only three and a half per cent per ann it amounts to nine millions one hundred thousand pound sterling  "Quere Is there in the whole universe as much gold in circulation as would discharge this debt If this is not sufficient is there as much gold and silver in circulation as would be sufficient for the purpose"  There is little to fix the attention of the passing traveller in this village as to scenery or houses except the agreeable though obviously elaborated spot occupied by the house and estate of Sir MARTIN FOLKES Clumps of the enduring fir and other hardy trees generally indicate at once the ungenial temper of the soil and the diligent hand of industry But the particular ground on which this gentleman's hall is erected is productive of something far  better than the proudest mansions amidst the most fertile domains have  always  to offer for what so fair or rich in nature dear Baron as a human being placed by fortune on an eminence amongst the poor and lowly at once able and willing to make them happy  Such a man is the owner of the house and lands which present themselves to your view at the extremity of this otherwise humble hamlet  A real knowledge of personal character is amongst the most difficult things to be got at not merely in the limited circuit of a few leagues but in the longest journey of human life It lies involved in so many labyrinths that the actual clue is torn from the hand of Truth till she herself is often wounded and lost among the mazes yet innumerable pretenders are ready to connect the broken thread each professing that his fidelity equals his zeal It thus becomes the hardest matter even for a deliberate traveller to gain  in some respects  information that is to be depended on either as to the real character of the poor or rich but in  others  he cannot be mistaken He who runs may read  where the general voice of a country is in arms to attack or to defend any particular member of it whether that individual be high or low provided nevertheless that individual is residentiary in which case it would be impossible for vice or virtue in the relative characters of domestic life of friend and neighbour master and servant to be concealed And methinks even an  en passant  traveller may form a pretty just account if he will adhere to a plan which suggested itself to your correspondent many years ago and which he has found correct in the ratio of at least ten to one where it has failed He is never so much in a violent hurry as to render his eyes and ears as useless upon the road as if he had put them into his portmanteau or locked them up in his trunk to be taken out and worn like his gala suit only at his place of visiting or on some grand occasion in some grand place where it is as impossible for them to be of any use as to either seeing of hearing the truth of character in any reasonable time as to count the drops of a shower of rain in London where though you  see and hear them pouring on you on all sides they seem to be all alike and to form only one indiscriminate puddle where the chrystal drops that have just descended from the heavens blend in a moment with the filth and ordure of the kennel and are thereby incorporated with the very dregs of the earth But in the country O in the countrymy dear friend ears and eyes if a traveller will but stop a little to employ them and call in one of man's proudest distinctions the voice are of real service as to furnishing the inquirer with unequivocal truth as to human character We may trace the same shower till its skiey particles free themselves from the embarrassments of the world and gain the stream where they assert and ascertain themselves We there see them pure as they fall from above they succour the drooping flower supply the thirsty herb enrich the land on which they fall and form its beauty and its good It is thus with the investigation of character In the country all that morally constitutes its bane or blessing and naturally its beauty and deformity lies within  reach and to continue the allusion whether the drop which each individual in the parish forms acts with the benign influence of the dew from heaven or so far as his power extends becomes tyrannous as the northern blast and perishes what it touches even like the breath of pestilence its salient or noxious quality is soon generally known Any four persons you may  accidentally  meet in your walk of liberal inquiry through a village or town will usually give you that knowledge respecting any character in the parish as well in the tour of an hour as could be attained in a twelvemonth by a person who took his report from thrice the number of  chosen  men who might be considered as the known friends or enemies of that character because both these are under a bias and I could not receive unsuspiciously the report of either whereas if in your chat with four residents you hear nearly the  same opinion  whether good or bad or even if there are three to one assenting however differently each may express himself you run very little hazard of being able with the deciding powers of your  own judgment summing up as it were the evidence before you of assuring yourself you have the true measure of the object examined  It may seem fanciful but I have no hesitation in recommending the adoption of this mode to  all  travellers in this dark road of existence In the usual way you are frequently referred from one partial or prejudiced person to another these giving you a determined panegyric and those an inveterate lampoon till poor Truth loses both her temper and her object  To travellers indeed who never stop but to change horses or stopping ask no questions but for the bill of fare and the distance betwixt stage and stage improving the intermediate time and space in sleep dashing with the swiftness but not with the use of a telegraph from one place to another or a  mainchance  traveller whose total of information and of object is very properly confined to the contents of the enormous red pocketbook and to the saddlebag wardrobe whose walk is from shop to shop  with his portable shop in shining oilskin holding the samples of his art and all his eloquence exerted to recommend themto him indeed or even to the traveller who from pride or modesty is averse to  ask any questions at all  or even to  speak to strangers  to all such my plan will appear  worse  than fanciful formidable impracticable impertinent No matter for one person who has received my converse with rudeness or repulsed my inquiry with a yet more sullen silence though even these things I know make up the character of the English to foreignersit has helped me frequently to discover worth genius and benevolence where none of those travellers would ever have found it and in the various countries I have passed has even  endeared  to my recollection many an humble cot and lowly pathway with many an object to share it all of which but for the inquisitive disposition to explore them would to me at least have "wasted their sweetness on the desert air" and not seldom has it given me opportunity to recommend such of their sequestered inhabitants  as wanted and deserved relief to protection more powerful than my own  Nor is it necessary to acquire these  best  delights of the traveller by the means either of curiosity or of obtrusion They are procured without exertion and are indeed the natural the inevitable consequences and rewards of those passing courtesies mentioned in my last letter The artisan at his work the labourer at his meal the youth at his sports the veteran resting on his crutch or seated on the bench of his porch to catch the vital spirit of the noonbeam the maid or matron at her wheel beside the door or the now busy and now vacant landlord whose whole stock of intelligence you purchase by a small portion of his own eloquent ale or good spirits are  all  sources of information and taken as they happen to present themselves to your view will not only prove the faithful historians of the place but they will generally look upon your entering with them into the urbanities of discoursethe matter and manner being not repulsiveas a kindness which entitles you to theirs in return  "He that questioneth much shall gain much" said the profound Bacon "but especially if he apply his questions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh for he shall give them occasion to  please themselves in speaking  and himself shall continually gather knowledge"  Thus too you gain not only genuine opinions and an insight into the characters of persons absentthe estimate each man holds in the mind of his fellowvillager or townsman but of the reporters who give you a hasty perhaps but strong drawn frequently humourous almost always sincere sketch of themselvesof their characters manners habits of thinking and modes of expression  Suffer me to illumine these remarks by an example drawn from immediate objects  An English landlord though not so officious a personage as one of the  old  Franceperhaps courtesy in the  new  is unrepublicanis far more expert than the same sort of character in Germany Mine host of Hillington has been liberal of his knowledge and civilityboth  of which he dispensed in the following manner without charging these articles in his billAs I was drawing on my gloves at the outward door of his house he thus began  You are disposed I see Sir for a walk in our bit of a villageExcept our Hall there is nothing worth seeing nor that much for  itself  And what is the name of the Owner  Sir Martin Folkes a very worthy gentleman my house is hisobserve the sign SirHillingtonHall and a good Hall it is for rich and for poorand there  goes  Sir Martinand that's his daughter as good as himselfNot such a fortune Sir as our Mr Coke and our Marquis Townsend or the new Lord of Houghton but has as good a heart as any of them and that is saying a bold word for our Baronet too  Pleased with report thus far I thanked my reporter and passed on to the stable where a man was rubbing down a friend whom I never forget  I am not the hostler Sir says the man but  I lend him a hand such as it is when he is out of the way he is gone into the field for our Sir Martinmake hay while the sun shines you know Sir such weather as this but for that matter were it deep of winter who would not work up to his chin in water for our Sir Martin  This Sir Martin bears a good name among you then  I will tell you  how you shall have him  at onceand as true as this is a whisp of straw for old as I am there is not a he or she in the parish have ever caught me in a lie As to Sir Martin then I will as I said tell you how you shall have him at once and do the needful to this poor beast of yours at the same time I can talk and work all under one  He twisted a fresh whisp and rubbed away  In the first place Sir Martin is a man remarkably good at  Justizeing  What he sends some of you to the Stocks and House of Correction  You shall hear if any of our Farmers are hard and heavy on a poor man he will see him  rightsided  'Tis in vain for a Farmer to  down  with a poor man because Sir Martin if he deserves it will as surely  up  him again ay and set him on his legs stronger than ever and make no more of the Farmer than I do of this strawsame by the Farmer for if he wants  rightsiding rightsided  he shall be and so shall your honour's horse presently  A large estate I suppose  Where he has a penny I wish he had a poundHowever he don't wantStock and shock o' the parish is his and what I say of him every chick and child will say also  A  young  Gentleman is he not  You shall have him at once there likewise his eldest daughterGod bless hera sweet young Lady and a finea jot ago past the stabledoorShe is about sixteen more or less so you know  he must  be about forty more or lessa time for all thingsno great age yet he's a Father to me that am sixty and two and a bit besides  How so  You shall have him again You must know  that after having served one of our topping Farmers thirty and three years comes a new man into Farm and  outs  with methereupon I went to Sir Martin to  justize  with him a littleYour honour says I you know all about me I then  up'd  and told him my caseam I to be  outed  after this fashion and after such a  sort  of years service Sir Martin  thought and thought  and  resulted and resulted  Never mind my good fellow said he when he had done  resulting  I will take care of you And so he did and so he does stilland I have a house and a home and am merry to say God bless the donor  Here is something honest friend to drink Sir Martin's health after you have given my horse something to drink also and then you may get him ready  All  that  shall be done Sir and I will drink your health into the bargain and if you are half as good as our Baronet to God will you go die when you please  I have taken a turn round the pleasure grounds by paths in the park which are open  to the passenger and in one of them I met three women and a boy returning from the Hall Two had their aprons well stored with  more  than the crumbs that fell from the rich man's tablea third had a large bowl of broth in her hand and the lad was laden with an ample jugg of milk  You have met with good luck this morning my friends  We meer as good any day when we have a mind to go for it said one of the women only we don't like to spur a free horse to death  Where do you come from  HillingtonHall was the answer  I required no more the evidence was allsufficient for me to look at the mansion with the reverence due to philanthropy and pronouncing as I passedblessed be the inhabitants Nor in your future survey of this village will you forget the circumstances that induce me to recommend it  In the map of Norfolk it occupies an inconsiderable spot It is scarce noted in the common  Roadbooks a few straggling farms and cottages comprize the whole hamletthe Hall itself is neither imposing by its grandeur nor awful from its antiquity and the circumjacent country is rather scanty than prodigal of the riches and the graces of Nature yet shall gratitude and hospitality ennoble it to your mind even as it will to that of your correspondent "It is not" said Atticus to Tully "our superb Athens so delights me by its magnificent structures as by presenting me with the images of excellent men whilst I review the houses where they liv'd the benches where they sat the places where they disputed And with pleasure also I contemplate their sepulchres I shall ever love therefore" continued Atticus the spot where thou Cicero wert born" On this principle I shall ever appreciate HillingtonHall  The importance of private benevolence or of tyranny as exercised by the Esquire or Lord or whatever other name or title the chief personage bears in a small town or village is beyond common calculation He can almost  give the part of the country where he is resident a new face bid peace and comfort smile around his neighbourhood or cover it with gloom If his disposition leads him to benignity the poorest hovel shall boast a chearful hearth and all its tenantry sport in his influence At little cost he may exclude even the powers of Envy from the bosoms of the lowly and implant the more happy inmates of gratitude and joy He may extend his generous sway so far as to dispense amongst those over whom Fortune has given him dominion the lenitives of pain the solaces of disease and attemper death itself nor are his good offices less eminently useful for the body than the soul the wisdom of his precepts or the example of his practice discountenances the vice and gives energy to the virtue of his dependents their heads and their hearts thrive equally under his protectorship and he includes in his character  It is on these grounds that the fashion which too many adopt of being in a manner only  visitors  at their family mansions and at home every where else is to be deplored "To the desertion of their country seats" observes an ingenious writer "may be traced the greater part of the evils which we lament in  every  neighbourhood" In many indeed too many neighbourhoods would have been more correct perhaps he limited the universal word "every" to MENEAGE which includes the parish of MANACCAN where the authour resides and where it is truly melancholy he tells us to observe from every point of prospect the number of old mansionhouses or villas that have fallen into decay in the course of the last fifty years He even informs us that good neighbourhood is now not only out of fashion but that the very term is the subject of  ridicule  Mr POLWHELE even admitting that he confines this heavy charge to Devonshire and Cornwall impresses his readers with A MOST startling idea respecting two fair and important counties of England which have been long famed not more for picturesque beauties of nature than for the urbanities and hospitalities of society This is degrading the "Cornish hug" with a vengeance At the same time we must perfectly agree with this writer that where most of the inhabitants are upon an equality and there is scarce a resident Gentleman as he informs us is the case in the whole peninbula of MENEAGE the little tradesmen peasantry and even the great farmers gradually lose their respect for rank and many decorums of society for want of a living good example which indeed can alone attach respectability to titles And what repeated improprieties and occasional enormities must arise from the inclinations of uninformed minds may be easily conceived Nor are the inconveniences to which the clergy are subjected in such a situation less obvious scattered as they are over the different parishes they have abundant reason for lamenting their solitary unsupported state In the mean time most of the proprietors of the good old English seats once possest by men of family as well as fortune pass their time in the countytowns occupied by borough chicanery and mining projects while those of higher degree spend their winters in London and their summers at some dull watering place or if they happen to make a visit of a month or two to their countryseats introduce into their neighbourhoods all the vices of the metropolis And what can be more shocking than  tonish  voluptuousness engrafted upon mulish rusticityThe last circumstance indeed is scarcely observable in the peninsula in which I reside says Mr P nor in any of these particulars would I speak exclusively of Meneage Other parts of Cornwall and of England have the same cause to complain of the absence of countrygentlemen and the common people there are equally headstrong and licentious In truth such is the nature of man that the multitude abandoned to "their own hearts desire" have in all ages and in all countries become more and more depraved till at length they have sunk into the deepest degeneracy  Mr POLWHELE has introduced these remarks in his "Old English Gentleman" with a very interesting description of one of these deserted manor houses or ruined ancient seats and which taken in a frequent by no means universalI trust indeed not generalacceptation must charm every reader of his poem and will in this place serve as a contrast to the honour virtue and happiness derived from all villas like HillingtonHall and a variety of others to which we are approaching  While now the sounds of cordial union fail  Where glooms the lonesome vill o'er every dale  While floats no more the voice of castled mirth  And scarce a cricket cheers the cottagehearth  Each little neighbourhood may perhaps afford  Some grave historian of its ancient lord  Some hoary peasant once a pamper'd groom  Who tells with rueful air the mansion's doom  When Sawle in wedlock with Erizey linkt  In his old master was at length extinct  Where his fleet racer vanish'd from the view  And where the last  goonhilly  perish'd too  Some gamekeeper who now with drooping mien  Eyes his bare plush alas no longer green  Laments his master doom'd far off to roam  An exile for oeconomy from home  And as each feature various griefs distort  Regrets the sad cessation of the sport  While boys with fearless shouts around him run  And at mid day the poacher vaunts his gun  Perhaps some vicar who halfcraz'd with care  Recounts the ruin of a thriftless heir  Pointing with signs that grief and pity mark  To his old patron's paledismantled park  Fell'd trees where whispering airs no longer play  And dismal windows that exclude the day  Where harvest wak'd the pastimes of delight  So pure as ne'er again shall charm the sight  And drest in garb so gay was Christmas hoar  As shall relieve his wearied eyes no more  Unless such hospitable cheer he see  In fond ideawith the Muse and me  the philanthropist  the physician the moralist or the christian  It is indeed almost impossible to enumerate the degrees of felicity which may result from an  intelligent upright and benevolent country gentleman whom Providence has blessed with the means of doing good  On the other hand if he is of a harsh and despotic temper of a base and sordid nature the pleasing picture here drawn the original of which your conscious eye has a daily opportunity of seeing displayed in every part of your own signiory would instantly change to its reverse and spread to the utmost limit of the village despot's authority His tenants would languish his peasantry droop the spacious mansion where like some malign demon he resides in solitary grandeur or amidst selfish carousals would be annoyed by the curse of the cottagers They would lie in wait for occasions of reprisal either in the silent mischief of nightly depredations or armed by wrongs act in avowed opposition to the oppressor's wishes and commands  How often have I seen a pestilential wretch of this kind even in generous England diffuse the  aggravations  of penury of sickness and of misery around him All ages and descriptions of persons unite to produce the vexation which such a being deserves and  can never escape  he is the scorn of the better part of his neighbourhood and the terror as well as scourge of the children of indigence But thank heaven much oftener have I seen amongst us the man of kinder manners operate as  a most  balmy antidote to this rural poisonI have seen childhood hang fondly on his robe as if it were the mantle of an angel I have observed the youth of the country follow his steps as if they led to heaven Towards him too have I noticed age hurry under the crutch that it might not lose an opportunity of paying him the homage of the silver hair In the slip of ground attached to the meanest shed the wholesome herb is substituted for the thistle which haply a harder master caused to grow there a cheary faggot warms the hut within and an uncankered rose blooms without It is a sacred scrap of  property a cherished morsel of independence which many of my more fortunefavoured countrymen delight to bestow and it makes the labourer's heart feel  proudly  even while it reconciles him to his humble situation he reflects that though it is his lot to toil over a thousand acres for others he has one dear spot which he may call HIS OWN O those two little words my friend how great is their import and how frequently does a single acre before which the exulting heart can place these monosyllables outmeasure kingdoms and empires The span of ground which has been dressed by the hand of affection is often more precious to the peasant who can say IT IS MINE than the whole domain of his master and the simplest flower which that smiling pittance of earth may yield proves a more welcome heartgift to the bosom of her he loves when he who presents it can say  it is from my own garden and was set by my own hand  than if it had been the offering of a monarch You will find in many parts of Norfolk and indeed very generally through the island these elevations of the human character where  as in many other States the subordinate though certainly not the least useful classes of Society so far from being encouraged to believe that they have a mite of property are not even permitted to feel that they are  themselves  in comparison of the higher orders more than mites in the vast creation  At a country seat in a small town or village generosity and avarice lovingkindness and tyranny are as easily seen and as plainly felt as the sunbeam and the mildew but I consider a wellaccommodated nobleman or gentleman resident upon or frequently resorting to his estate as a firstrate benefactor of mankind In the vast metropolis I may admire his establishment seem for a moment though but for a moment I hope diminished by his situation or be really attracted by his talents and popular qualities but all this in his  town house  has more or less of a grand exhibition it gives the sensation of a  spectacle  and on the  gala  scale measures to little more than the gaze of the mob as their eyes pursue the ornaments of his carriage or the court dress in which his natural  size and shape are encumbered and concealed when he disenthralls himself from that carriage to make his bow at the levee  It is chiefly at his country seat and in the thriving farms or comfortbrightening cottages which encircle and rejoice around like satellites illumined and fed by their planet that I can offer him the tribute of my affectionAnd when I have witnessed a man of this description in the benignity of his orb effusing his rays where their light and heat were wanted I have frequently compared him with the most renowned conqueror brightest wit or most august potentateprovided they had nothing better than the laurels of victory or genius or the sceptre of dominionand found him superior to them all "After having made to pass in review before the reader" says an ingenious writer "the many tyrants who oppressed the earth the many madmen who laid it waste the many fanatics who have been deceived it may be asked of what advantage to mankind were the conquests of Clovis the cunning of Mahomet the victories of Charlemagne the  invasion of William the Norman the valour of Godfrey de Bouillon the prudence of Rhodolph of Hapsburgh the politics of Charles the Fifth the ambition of Philip the Second and the genius of Richelieu" Their empires their triumphs their conquests their politics these disappeared with them Even the violent shocks they gave the world have scarcely left a trace of them We contemplate with infinitely more pleasure the discoveries of Vasco de Gama and Columbus the voyages of Magellan and of Drake the great changes which the intrepidity of Luther and Calvin produced in the politics and religions of Europe the labours of Copernicus and Tycho Brache of Kepler and Galileo the works of Bacon Descartes Newton and Locke the productions of Tasso Shakspeare Ben Jonson and Dryden of Corneille Raphael and Michael Angelo the study of religious truths of the sciences and of  Belles Lettres  have a more beneficial influence upon the mind and produce more lasting effects than the most intimate acquaintance with the conquests and intrigues of princes  and statesmen But we might go much farther Baron We might insist that the private gentleman who preserves the morals and presides over the beings around him as well by the influence of his example as his bounty is the true glory of a nation As far as in him lies he repairs the ruins which have been made by the different circumstances that set men at variance in fine that every such person of whatever country of whatever persuasion tends to RECREATE that order which the anarchy of clashing interests and the wild hurry of human passions have brought into the world  The most delightful object afforded us by the

announce something extraordinary By the imposing attraction of these you enter upon the longcelebrated domain of the WALPOLES who took their names from a town in what is called the marshland of this county Here Joceline de Walpole was living in the reign of our first Richard but Reginalde de Walpole who flourished in the time of our first Henry is thought to be the lineal ancestor of the present family not that I hold the settlement of this matter quite so material as the disputed point  between  "the good men of Lynn"  whether King Henry  If it be true that the  honour  of a gift is derived

under consideration as that of Holkham Rainhim and fifty others you will find curiously and laboriously set down for you in the countyhistories yea and in the several  shewbooks  presented to ladies and gentlementravellers at the  shewhouses  by the domestic oracles in waiting and who have related the family honours so often that you will hear them describe the beauty of one ancestor the heroism of another and the bounty of a third with as unmeaning a voice and tone as the chorister chaunts his hymn or the schoolboy chimes his lesson looking at the same time with as unmoved a set of features and as inveterate an aspect as the great founders of the family whether ruff'd or whisker'd whether in tapestry marble or bronze For these good reasons I shall not describe them here Much less shall I rob the household historians of their perquisite by leading you step by step through the apartments beginning with the Hall of Entrance although the ceiling and the frieze of boys were executed by

from the splendour of intellectual or moral qualities is  that  my friend which will impress yours long before the doors of this noble edifice shall be opened to you by the servant permitted to shew them With the rapidity of thought your mind will go back to all you have heard or read of the celebraited  There has lately been given to us the Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole by an author every way qualified to become the biographer of that great minister and extraordinary man The performance of Mr Cox will fill your mind with a history of the politicks not only of this country but of Europe for the space of half a century Rejecting with equal disdain every inflated encomium and exaggerated assurance the Historian conducts us through the events of Sir Robert's public and private life with great truth and impartiality from his youth to his death Unseduced by the voice of Friendship Admiration or Flatterywhich at one time gravely told us Sir Robert was  born  a minister at another that he was endowed with a  genius  for calculation and that all application was unnecessary because he knew every thing by  intuition  Mr Cox informs us that Sir Robert Walpole came early into Parliament spoke at first indifferently until habit and practice rendered him an able debater that he was promoted to an office in the admiralty in the th year of his age became secretary at war at thirty was trained to business under Marlborough and Godolphin and managed the House of Commons during the Whig administration Being deprived of his place he distinguished himself in opposition was persecuted by the Tories and considered as a martyr by the Whigs He promoted with unabated zeal the Protestant succession and was rewarded for his services with the place of paymaster of the forces by the new Sovereign whom he had assisted in fixing upon the throne Thus educated and inured to business having thus served under government and acted in opposition he was placed at the head of the Treasury In this situation adored by his family beloved by his friends and esteemed by his party he was courted and idolized  The fate of Sir Robert Walpole's character as a minister has been extremely singular While he was in power he was reviled with unceasing obliquy and his whole conduct arraigned as a mass of corruption and political depravity But he himself lived to see the propriety of his preventive measures acknowledged by the public As time softened the asperities of personal animosity and as the spirit of party subsided there was scarcely one of his opponents who did not publicly or privately retract their unqualified censures and pay a due tribute to the wisdom of the general principles which guided his administration Impartial posterity has done still greater justice to the memory of a statesman who whatever might have been his public or private defects maintained his country in tranquillity for a longer period than has been experienced since the reign of James the First  And Mr Burke who seems to have fairly appreciated his merits and scanned his defects observes "that the prudence steadiness and vigilance of Sir Robert Walpole joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics preserved the crown to this Royal Family and with it their laws and liberties to this country"  His address moreover was so frank and open his conversation so pleasing and his manner so fascinating that those who lived with him in habits of intimacy adored him those who saw him occasionally loved him and even his most bitter opponents could not hate him One of these did not hesitate to say of him "Never was a man in private life more beloved" and his enemies allow no man did ever in private life deserve it more He was humane and grateful and a generous friend to all who he did not think would abuse that friendship His character naturally procured that attachment to his person which has been falsely attributed solely to a corrupt influence and to private interest but this shewed itself at a time when these principles were very faint in their operation and when his ruin seemed inevitable  Although he was thought neither to love or encourage their art and even to neglect men of letters our poets have been liberal of their eulogiums Pope says  Seen him I have but in his happier hour  Of social pleasure illexchang'd for pow'r  Seen him uncumber'd with the venal tribe  Smile without art and win without a bribe  And Mr Coxe has inserted a portrait drawn by the pen of the elegant Sir Charles Hanbury Williams from whose tribute the subsequent lines will afford you pleasure  form'd to govern and to please  Familiar greatness dignity with ease  Compos'd his frame admir'd in every state  In private amiable in public great  Gentle in power but daring in disgrace  His love was liberty his wish was peace  Such was the man that smil'd upon my lays  And what can heighten thought or genius raise  Like praise from him whom all mankind must praise  Whose knowledge courage temper all surpris'd  Whom many lov'd few hated none despis'd  I cannot wholly take leave of his character without clearing him in one instance of that want of political decorum and for the derision of that public spirit for which his biographer observes he was in general blamed with good reason I allude to the political axiom generally attributed to him that  all men have their price  and which has been so often repeated in verse and prose but the sense was perverted by leaving out the word  those  Flowery oratory he despised he ascribed to the interested views of themselves or their relatives the declarations of pretended patriots of whom he said  "All  THOSE  men have their price"  and in the event many of them justified his observation  founder  and those distinguished relatives who have successively possessed and ennobled it The  inanimate objects first looked at within and without will soon become secondary The  simple circumstance of knowing that many of the trees in the magnificent woods were planted  by Sir Robert Walpole will carry your reflections from the plantation to the planter and all which refers solely to vegetation however delicious its charm at other times to the senses will give place to more profound reflections You will take a retrospective view of the extraordinary man who continued first British Minister of State from the time that the structure was begun in to its complete finishing inside and out in The whole expanse of your mind will fill with the events characters and deep public concerns which marked the epoch of his administration The history of this little island and of the vast continent as connected with and suffer me to say in many respects dependent on its politicks and its commerce will croud upon you for a while  woods which have long been the admiration of travellers will shrink diminished before you or be so subordinate to the governing idea that you will be able to afford then no distinct notice and the very first portrait you are shewn of this Minister or of Horace Walpole will engross you whole attention though the keeper of the house lions who has little time to spare for contemplative visitors will be impatient to draw you off from Statesmen and from Bards to her Derbyshire marble bronze Gladiators granite cisterns alabaster columns velvet beds sleeping Venusses bathing Nymphs santa Susannas and Court beauties  But as all these and whatever is assembled near them certainly deserve the notice of every traveller and will be the principal attractions with most I will no longer withhold the promised description you will gain a clear idea from what follows  The extent of the building including the colonnade and wings which contain the offices is feet the main body of the house extends feet The hall which is furnished in the  inside with stone is a cube of feet the saloon by feet and the other rooms are feet high The rustic and attic stories are feet high each under the rustic story are arched vaults The whole building is of stone and is crowned with an entablature of the Ionic order with a balustrade above and there is a cupola with lanterns at each corner of the house The mansion for the compass of ground it stands on is reckoned as finely ornamented and as well furnished as any house in the kingdom  The foundationstone placed in the southeast angle hath a Latin inscription upon it to the following purport "Here  that  Sir Robert Walpole with whom thou posterity shalt not be unacquainted hath fixed  me  to stand as the foundation of a seat designed to be built in his native country the th day of May in the year GOD grant that after its master to a mature old age shall have long enjoyed it in perfection his latest descendents may safely possess it in an unimpaired condition to the end of time"  To this inscription has been annexed the subsequent morsel of morality "One would think Sir Robert had in his thoughts the uncertain state in all ages and countries of  Prime Ministers  and of the  superb structures  built by them in the height of their power"  Neither shall the august anecdote be omitted of one of your German Emperors who being in England when Duke of Lorrain was entertained at Houghton with the most magnificent repast that it is said was ever given in this kingdom a right patriotic banquet too loyal as liberal for it seems all the fish and all the fowl and all the game and every other viand was of the produce of Old England and its domestic appendages yea and the variety such as was never before known or collected at one table Even relays of horses were provided on the roads to bring rarities from the remotest parts of the Empire  In the way from Syderstone the woods appear to the greatest advantage they are seen to a great extent with openings left judiciously in many places to let in the view of more  distant plantations which changes the shade and gives them that solemn brownness that has always a happy effect It appears to give a congenial colour to thought and the hue most favourable to meditation  The woods which are seen from the southfront of the house are planted with great judgment to remedy the defect of a flat country The trees are so disposed as to appear one beyond another in different shades  Having banquetted your taste and feelings in a survey of the stately Pile and all that there meets the eye you will allow me to conduct you to other interesting objects I have to beg then you will in idea accompany me in a walk across the park by the newlyprojected grand entrance to the place where all greatness but that of the soul must fade awaythe place of sepulture  Houghtonchurch is a neat gothic building in the full view of the hall thus furnishing a picturesque and moral object to the living proprietors  I am attended in my visit to this sacred  spot by the villageclerk who is another of those original beings so frequently to be met with in England and who is at this moment so singularly blending an account of himself with his information of others that if I can describe both as well as he has doneand that I may the more vividly do so I have as usual my pencil in my handyou will gain the  truth of character  through all the quaintness and oddity of the reporter better than if Biography was to address you in all her dignity though she were to wait on you arrayed in her long robes sweeping into their folds all the pomps and vanities of posthumous panegyric  "You come on a remarkable day Sir Strangerbirthday of his Royal Highnessship George by the Grace of GOD Prince of Wales and on that of our AuditFeast and moreover the day before we begin harvest so ten of his Highnessship's father's pictures set in gold have been given by order of our new Lordand the Lord love

noddle before he sticks sickle into corn why the whole stack will catch cold before it gets into sheaf that's our Norfolk notionso we treat with a little of last year's cornout of the barrel hope no offence Sir Gentleman Stranger  None in the world Mr Clerk  Clerk Sir Gentleman is only my title my name is Jarvis and I am moreover Sexton as well and more than that I am the greatest fool in HoughtonParish nay in this whole hundred of Gallow where it stands and if any man can prove himself a greater numps than Jarvis let him come forth  How so my friend  Look at those pretty deer staring at you Sir Stranger while some stamp their little feet as though they were angry at you while others  trot away as if they were frightened at you and some keep nibbling the grass as if they cared nothing about you by the same token I have seen as fine a head of deer in this park as in any of Norfolk and would you believe it I had for a  sort  Sort  of years  sort  of money c is a word in constant use amongst the unlettered classes of people in Norfolk  of years the care of all those dappled fellows and hundreds upon hundreds more I was their playfellow and their friend Sir Gentleman and the poor fools knew me and would follow me and eat out of my hand and I do really think they loved me as well as they do one anotheras well as that doe at feed under the elms does the fawn by its side and when i' the venison time I was obliged to single my marks from the herd I went skulking about the park like a thiefand for that matter so I was you knowI felt just as if I was going to shoot a child and when I hit any of them they cried just like oneO 'tis a barbarous piece of work Sir Gentleman and when I have seen 'em just as they were  dying looking pitifully in my face with the tears in their eyes I thought I deserved to be shot myself  But how came your Lord to part with so good a parkkeeper  He part GOD love the stone that covers him I will shew it you presently I parted myself I was not only park but gamekeeper and a better thing besidesLord George's righthand man as he used to call me First thing in a morning was Jarvis bring my boots Jarvis my slippers how fare the greyhounds the deer the horses and more than all the sheep hey Jarvis and all just as freespoken and kindly as I am to you and so on for years hasty and hot a little now and then to be sure but give him his way that youngster of a fawnling skipping across our path might lead him but crossgrain him and one of our bullsand there is a mad one in the meadows could not match him for raving and roaring Let him run on he would stop before he got at you and give you his hand instead of his foot and I that knew all this and that loved him as  I did my soul and might have kept my place till his deathhour Ito go and say to him one day as I did Lord George if you don't like me leave me Lord George if you think you can mend yourself try And what Sir Stranger do you think he did upon this Up's with a table and if I had not run off and shut the door would have smash'd my saucy sconce as I hear he smash'd the table and there would have been an end of Jarvis  Why did you not return and by submission try to make your peace Jarvis  Afraid and ashamed Sir Strangerand you would have been afraid toohe glared at me like a lion and would have devoured me just as easily O Lord George what a terrible Lord George you was in a passion and O Jarvis Jarvis what a dd numps must you be who knew this not to let him have it out with you If a servant or tenant or neighbour would but give him time to turn himself round in one of his high winds he would be as mild as a May morning but when once he turned  any one away for  crosshoppling  never took him again  That was an unfortunate day for you friend Jarvis  So my brother got the place and held it to my Lord's death and holds it still for our last Lord Lord Horace one of your scholar gentry though we never saw much of him indeed after he was lorded kept all the old servants and our new Lord has not yet said  you must go  to any of them so I suppose they are to stay Ay Sir Stranger it was a sorrowful thing to think I never afterwards could hear the best master and the best man in the world say how do the greyhounds how fare the deer and how are all the people in Houghtonvillage with Jarvis or good Jarvis and sometimes friend Jarvis at the end of the question It wasn't the losing the place so much but never again being  about  such a master having free  regress  and  ingress  into his  own room  or if I saw him in the park gardens plantations or what not running to him speaking to him on  this case and that casesuch a poor man is footsore and should rest Lord George such a poor woman is sick and wants sommut more comforting than doctors or doctor's stuff Lord George poor Snap must have a holiday Spring is fresh as a daisy again Smoaker is now a match for any they can bring against him Lord George No Sir Gentleman this was all over and then to lose going of his errands i' the parish or farther afield as case required a bottle of wine to one a brothjoint to another a bit of money to another Jarvis go and see how poor Will is carry something good to Tom's wife Yes Sir Stranger to lose all this after such a sort of years being his kindnesscarrier as I may say to half the country for wherever there was a want there would go Lord George or his kindnesscarrier But after I had shot my fool's bolt Sir Gentleman no more of all this for me if I met him in my path I dropt my head and slunk off like a hound who had been sheep worrying and I have sat moping under a hedge like a beggar going to steal the linen or hid myself i' the  woods as if I wanted to rob the house though GOD knows I only went there because I was ashamed to be seen and many is the good cry I have had there all alone though I suppose at my age Sir Stranger you think I ought to be ashamed of that But this would not do long so I went to live in another family because I hated at last to see myself upon the grounds where I was as useless as a nettle in a garden and worse for nobody thought it worth while to pull me up or knock me down Heighoand the deer too they seem'd to join against me  A fallen favourite you know Jarvis  I know what you mean having thank GOD a  pretty tightish understanding in the natural way  I was fallen out of favour sure enough for Tall Jack one of the old standardsa brave buck when I came like a fool one day and walked a matter of twelve miles just to  look  at the old park shook his antlers at me and stampt his foot several times and stood as stiff as a ram as much as to say"You have no business at Houghton now old Jarvis"But since that  time I have got to be SextonClerk and by coming backwards and forwards to this church the dappled chaps some of them get round me yet I sometimes think it is more for a little prog I now and then carry in my pocket to coax them rather than for love of me as it used to beheighoheighoWell now if you please Sir we will go inside my church Poor Lord George we have him there still It was my lot to do for him after he was dead  however  I buried him Would to GOD he was alive to look at me again though he looked like a lion I would not run away from him again I promise you Angry or pleased I never saw such another friend nor landlord nor master and if you don't choose to believe me ask every man woman and child you meet that knew him in the country"  We had rather strolled and sauntered in different directions near the chapel than moved towards it during the greatest part of the above conversation from which I trust you will catch a more striking likeness of Lord George Orford than from any or from all  the portraits you will be shewn of him at the hall You will see the genuine features of that truly worthy nobleman's soul in their best lights thinly shaded if they may be called shades by his singular manners and by the one dark yet  passing  shadow of a sudden temper The painter it is true has etched without art but every touch is a stroke of nature and had you seen his figure or heard his voice while they were thus employed you would swear to the whole drawing being an original Indeed to  two  originals for he would have presented you with an admirable sketch both of the living and of the dead I had abundant opportunity before I left Houghton to find that the master and the man were given with equal fidelity of pencil of this I will offer some pleasing evidence before we take our leave of this interesting spot  But I must allow you and myself a pause having just transcribed this letter at the Inn from my pencil'd minutes of friend Jarvis's discourse which I offer you as nearly as possible in his own words and my landlady  Mrs Kendal assures me she could swear to their being the words of neighbour Jarvis They are however those of an odd but tenderhearted fellow and I hope he will recommend himself to the patronage of his new Lord  LETTER XI  HOUGHTON  August  I PROCEED in my transcriptions from my penciled notebook which both at home and abroad I have considered as the vehicle in which I place the unassorted ears I gather in the fields of observation a plan which has the advantage of collecting my stores from the spots where they grew and allows the opportunity of selecting and separating winnowing and preserving at more leisure after my growing stock is housed But though I always perform these several tasks to the best of my judgment not only  before  I carry the grain to the  public  market but before I send my detached sheaves to you my judicious friend in the way of sample I can no more promise you that I do not from oversight send you sometimes  a poppy with the corn sometimes an idle weed with the balmy herbs and sometimes a useless flower with the verdant loads than the farmer can undertake to warrant  his  hay or  his  wheat free from a thistle a weed or a wormbite Neither of us can do more than aver that no pains are spared to prevent these intermixtures becoming objects of  weight  or consequence in the general bulk of our commodity and as to myself I may fairly be allowed to observe that it has all along been and will continue to be my custom to submit my gatherings to the inspection of some of our most approved judges in the  quality  of all sorts of literary grain from the most golden ear of intellectual wheat to the minutest blade of grass and simplest flower in the abundant garden of nature  previously  to my conveying them to you Thus guided by their judgment in the first instance and assisted in the second by yours I think I may be permitted in the language of our English merchants to "hope you will find the accounts correct  errors excepted"  Immediately on entering the chapel Jarvis went hastily to the part of the aisle where the ashes of his master were deposited "Here he lies Sir Stranger" said he pointing to the plain stone that covered the remains "here he is I help'd to put him down with my own hands and mine were not the only tears that dropt upon his coffin as it was lowering if it had been all night in the dew it could not well have been wetter I don't often cry but I did then like a beat babyand the thought on't often makes a child of old Jarvis still" It does honour to his memory and to your own feelings at this moment my good Jarvis said I perceiving his eyes were filling "And here" cried Jarvis "is the great Sir Robertthere his first ladyhere his secondand there Lord Horaceand I put HIM in too"  As I moved a few steps to inspect the marble of the latter my foot slid insensibly on the stone sacred to Lord George"Don't tread upon him Sir Gentleman" said Jarvis suddenly but very gently plucking my coat "Its foolish enough you'll say but I never set  foot on it myself if I can help itbut then to be sure I was but his servingmanyet I be always so bold to keep off strangers when I can and many's the douse I have given the boys and girls whose fathers and mothers he gave house and home to whensomever I have seen them run and scuttle over it as if it was the grave of one of my Lord's greyhounds or as if it held the bones of such a fellow as his humble servant Jarvis"  The most natural testimony of the speaker's full heart followed this expression He bowed at every word he uttered of the last line and it was precisely such a bend both of the head and body as a comparative sense of situations betwixt master and servant excites in a grateful and respectful domestic and I am convinced it was just the sort of reverence which Jarvis had often paid in the lifetime of his Lord for the features the air and the accent of a dutiful adherent all harmoniously accorded At the end of a very long pause which ensued he shook his head and in a sighretarded articulation exclaimed"Little and great must all  go to be sure but I wish I could have got cleverly at the speech of you before you  lost yourself  Lord George just to have heard you sayJarvis I don't think any more of your sauceor that you could but know how I have mop'd about it sincemay be though you DO know it for 'twill be a bad job for other folk's souls if yours Lord George an't in heaven"The head continued shaking till the owner of it arrived at this consolatory close when seeming to be inspired with the cheering influence of the sentiment he lifted up his drooping figure and cried"'Tis nothing but dust Sir Stranger that lies here and a man loses his time in moaning thus for a heap of bones which to be sure we are all born to be gentle and simple you and I So now let me tell you something about this fine old affair a little farther on"  He pointed to a stone coffin "That too is a Walpole" added he "part you see broke eleven years back I got a piece of his rib He was taken up in Brumsthorpe churchyard and brought herewas one of the Norwich  bishops with the date on his footand that's all we know of  him  Lookee there are the 'scutcheons of our OrfordsSir Robert's and Lord George'sand there is the last the scholar Lord's not yet put up"  And are there to be no other monuments erected to them  "None Sir Stranger"  This intelligence interested my mind and if I were not fearful of hazarding too bold a figure should add inspired my Muse By her  assistance  at least on my return to Mrs Kendal's I

HOUGHTON  August  THE good clerk was little disposed to break in upon the reflections that filled my mind as he returned with me to the inn being himself inclined to silent meditation on rejoining him however after two or three convivial hours which he passed at the birthday and audit feast the quaint hilarity of his character which opened our first views of him returned and he was earnest to know if he could give me any farther pleasure To ask this wellmeant question he came from the festive throng into the room where I had been throwing upon paper the verses which concluded my last letter He had obviously dispelled the gloom collected at the chapel where he bewailed the dead and by some generous draughts had since warmed his heart towards the  living He now came with a hope I would not refuse to go into the banquetting apartment to drink the health of his Highnessship George Prince of Wales the new master and mistress of Houghton Lord and Lady Cholmondeley and success to the sicklemaking a very respectful though not quite correct bow for each of the objects thus to be toasted Having promised this I was proceeding to place my papers in a small  ecritoire  which is always my  compagnon de voyage  when the page on which I had written the monumental verses falling on the floor he picked it up with great respect and said as he delivered it to me he fancied it was full of  poetals  He instantly repeated that it had pleased GOD though he was a poor fellow to give him a fairish understanding in the natural line and that he had made a  poetal  or two himself one on a famous dog of Lord George's which beat every thing both at Swaffham and Newmarket and one the night Lord George was buried I told him I would gladly exchange with him on that subject by reading my  poetal  to him if he would read or repeat his  to me "Yours then Sir Stranger first my head  is  a little noncomposs'd at present"  I then read to him what I had the pleasure to insert in my last letter and I dare say his  poetals  which did not however return to his memory in time for me to see them were not more curious than his  criticals  which I received in the very words I will give them to you Yet it is not in written nor indeed in any oral language but his own that I can express or figure him Though a little noncomposs'd as he called it that is inspirited by circulating the jovial rounds to the healths of the Prince the new Lords of Houghton Hall and success to the sickle just enough to obliviate the gloom which the scene in the church had produced the quaint gravity of his voice and the innocent conceits of himself mixed with his opinion of others came to the exact point of being pleasant One bumper too little I have observed will make an Englishman of this class sullen incommunicative or rudely talkative and one too much renders him insufferably loquacious while the medium glass seems to  invigorate his active and excite his dormant good qualities or talents but drinking deep or not drinking at all discloses all that are bad and offensive making him a downright saucy or sulky fellow  At friend Jarvis's desire I read the verses twice over "because  poetals"  he said "hit a poor man i' th' noddle harder than  prosals  at first I can't so cleverly get at 'em" On the second reading he had comments for almost every couplet Accept a few  All of one noble stock and all our own  Line  On telling him these applied to three of the Walpoles he cried "Sir Stranger you are right as to that  poetal  for they are all our own sure enoughbut as you say there were three times three of them Muses I have met with some of they in one of our books in the library about the gods and goddesses though there was as I thought a pretty deal of deviltry in them tooand as for the goddesses I think a little whipping at the cart's tail would have  been too good for most of they I should be sorry to have my old dame half as bad as the best of 'um By the bye" added he "three times three is just the rounds we have been making out of the jolly birthbowl below to his Highnessship and the other honourships the founders of the feast and I hope Sir Gentleman you will help us off with three times three rounds morewhen you have got through your poetals So pray read on but don't hurry'Learning is better than house or land' ay or punch either"  I smiled and proceeded  The next let ev'ry art  That faithful nature aids and ev'ry heart  His bounty warm'd in grateful sighs declare  He felt for all the poor a father's care  Lines  That observed I is designed as a tribute to the goodness of your noble  "Lord George" interposed the learned clerk "you need not tell me thatBefore I have done with you please GOD I'll shew you more of this not only in printed book but  in other guess places worth all the poetals that ever wasyours Sir Gentleman into the bargain"  Taste learning elegance the last endear  And his least honour to have died a Peer  Lines  "Died a Peerthere you hit him" quoth Jarvis "he was but an Honourable beforea nation great  poetal  though and a good Sir gentleman which is betterOne of the sups of broth I used to take from the Hall kitchen to one of Lord George's poor bodies is worth all them devil come gods and goddesses toomuse madams into the bargain  While pomp's vast pyramids assault the sky  Line  "Piradims" repeated the clerk▪ "ay there you hit him again Sir Stranger but please GOD I will know more about it by next Sunday As you said the poetals are to be left in my church"I had told him so"I'll have at them at byehours all the weekfor you may see I have a little meaning of these things in mebut must not let 'em lie about to  be catch'd up every Sabbath by our Houghtonfolk who could no more make 'emout than the old Walpole in the stone coffin I shewed youexcept the stewardMrs the housekeeper and Mrs Kendal my landlady here below who has no bad gift at  poetals  herself"  And rear a monument in every breast  Last line  "I am sure" exclaimed Jarvis fervently "Lord George has one in mine ay and I will have every word of the poetal here in my head before my new lady comes which is to be in October and till then I will clap 'um in my prayerbook and the first Sunday morning she comes to church they shall be laid on her ladyship's Pess and I will tell her they were left for the family by a travelling poeter and I'll tell her ladyship your name Sir Stranger if you like to say who you be"  That is not necessary but you may say if you please they were left by the Gleaner  "Very well Mr Gleaner  I am here to mention the good Jarvis's disappointment as it has been reported to me since these papers were sent to press After preparing rehearsing and getting perfect in the eloquent speech with which the learned clerk was to introduce these verses in the delivery of which he expected to divide at least in equal proportions the honours of the Bardafter he had made himself as mellow in every syllable of them as in his amen he unluckily mentioned the circumstance to some of the head servants who advised they might be given to my Lady  before  she went to church upon which the learned clerk yielded them up to the groom of the chambers  without any speech at all  for want of which all our honours of course came to nothing and it is not more probable that my friend the clerk has forgot his speech than that the groom has forgot to deliver the verses seeing they were as much out of his way as for old Jarvis to become running footman  and so I will and for that matter about that time I shall be a Gleaner myselfbut first and foremost I shall be Mr Harvesterand by the same token only hear how they farmergentry in the parlour and we workyfolk in the kitchen roar out the sicklesongs as we call themenough to turn the heads of poor Mrs Kendal and her welllook'd daughterbut as I said harvest comes but once a yearso what say you Sir Strangerhuzza there they work it huzza  a drop after your poetals won't be amiss huzza his Highnessship for ever"  The cheary echos and choruss'd burthens from below now had their full effect upon every muscle in the face and indeed in every limb of my right learned clerk and commentator and that I might not any longer detain him from joining the happy groupe I delivered him the monumental lines to be presented with "what flourish he might" And after putting them very cautiously in his pocketbook between as he said two bans of marriage and notice of a parish meeting for the next Sunday I rose to accompany him down stairs where two as jovial crews had assembled as I ever had the delight to see happy more especially as is usually the case those in the kitchen at the supreme presidency of which our learned clerk soon placed himself They were gathered together in the inn facing the old grand entrance which was built by Sir Robert Walpole and it may be fairly doubted whether since the foundation of his splendid hall or this his humble inn there has  met on any occasion a set of more blissful beings Amorous and agricultural songs were mixed unclouded joy shook the loud note as from their heart of hearts and the louder the sound the truer the joy  "Home celebrate Harvesthome"an old field ditty in great favour with the English peasantry was encored and reencored with that vehemence of applause which marks in a particular manner the labouring parts of mankind when loosed a little from toil to joy which they describe by a mixture of ungovernable noises from hands feet and voiceThis is the point of time which opens the whole soul of this useful class of men throws hand into hand heart into heart and divides goodfellowship from drunkenness It is a crisis when a lover of nature and of his species whatever might be the state of his own mind unless his temper is harder than the severest misfortune  must  "gather bliss to see his fellows bless'd"and at such a moment have I recently come dear Baron from viewing this carefree groupe of beings every one of whom in the pauses from  drink dance and song bore genuine evidence of the high and endearing qualities of the late and present possessors of HoughtonHall The  groundless  fears of some of the domestics from the apprehension that old adherents of the family would be dismissed to make way for newthe goodness of their new Lord in continuing the generous custom of their Lord to receive for the rent of each house in HoughtonVillage a shilling instead of a guineathe school bounty and establishment instituted by Lady Cholmondeley for poor male and female childrenwith their pretty uniform dresses in preparation for the day on which they are first to have the honour of appearing before their patroness these and various other records of the existing charities and benevolencies were all poured forth with tones and with looks that ratified the intelligence It was AN HONEST MOMENT and a spectator might securely have given in to the court of humanity every syllable of the evidence on oath and it will make your heart glow my friend as it has already done mine Would you had been at my side to have shared  it  alas many an hour must intervene before even this imperfect report reaches you and then it will be but as a fair but faint shadow of the living pleasure I have tasted but its counterpart will wait your coming On every genial return of the year you may enjoy the substance either at the place from which I am now writing or at some other Thus the felicity of our peasantry and the liberality of our Nobles are not merely local those who bless and those who are blessed are widely diffused You will meet with hearttouching instances of both and while nature groans and philanthropy is bleeding in almost every other land and those amongst us who have neveras alas we too often have my friend heard those groans or seen that blood raise the voice of discontent you will be convinced that we may proudly say that the poorest subject of the realm of Englandamidst all our foes abroad and at homeall our political evils or religious errorsand I not only confess but will discover to you many of eachour very daylabourersour children of the plough and of the  flailnay even those who literally can neither toil nor spinour children of age of infirmity and of misfortune are better secured in their domestic enjoymentin the dear and fertile land whereon they live in their morsels of property upon itin their sickness and their sorrows better consoled and administered to than either the rich or poor in any other country of the globe  This great truth is beautifully touched by one on the long list of our illustrious female living writers of whom you will expect to hear more in their place  that lov'd isle  Where freedom long has shed her genial smile  Less safe in  other  hands the triple wall  And massy portal of the gothic Hall  Than in that favoured isle the strawbuilt thatch  Where Freedom sits and guards the simple latch  HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS  You will more than forgive my friend you will welcome these patriot effusions of a heart which though it feels an enlarged wish for the happiness of mankind more affectionately beats to Britain not simply because it is  Link'd to that heart by ties for ever dear  but because having had various opportunities of seeing and residing in many other popular countries and making on each comparative observations not those of an enthusiast or of a bigot but of a slow patient and pausing experimentalist I must again and as often as every fresh cause offers pronounce England with all its imperfections on its head THE UNRIVALLED COUNTRY I will venture to add no man that has at any time been or that  now  You will permtt your Correspondent as you have the book to refer you to an "Ode on the Benevolence of England" in the first volume of his former Gleanings  is within the shelter of its protecting arms has "seen its like"  Nor have I ever yet conversed with a travelled person or read a travelled Authour supposing him to have possessed the degree of  health  which fairly tints every object who has not been of this opinionwhatever his character whatever be his country The rule therefore is I am persuaded general and I cannot allow as exceptions those  ephemera who fly from one clime to another with the idle and undetermined course of a butterfly and who if you will permit me the use of a facetious expression are as completely ignorant of the real good which a country contains as a cat or monkey running over a harpsichord is of the use of the keys from a skilful touch of which even were it an indifferent instrument the true artist would bring  some  sweet sounds  P S You will more than accept you will welcome a brilliant passage from an animated foreigner who while he confirms illustrates the exulting assertions of the foregoing letter assertions my friend which on so many different occasions I already have been and I trust shall again be called upon in the character of a faithful delineator an intrepid defender of my country to maintain And so firmly do I feel myself standing on this ground that I am ready to meet whatever wit eloquence ambition ridicule or enmity could oppose to the unadorned the almost naked arms of truth  MALLET DU PAN and the reputation that is associated with him cannot be unknown to you This slight mention of his name will bring him to your mind as the indefatigable and ingenious opposer of anarchy and the French Directory a native I believe of Switzerland that stupendous and romantic country with which you are so enamoured and justly whether it be considered topographically or intellectually He left Switzerland just in time to escape the requisition made by the five new despots of Paris to their Helvetic dependants to deliver up every man of genius who was their adversary Soon after his arrival in the country where every man of every nation is safe and where all genius is honoured and rewarded he published the  prospectus  of a work called  "Mercure Britannique"  with the avowed purpose of being the public accuser of the French Directory and vigilant detector of all their falsehoods and fabrications He has kept his word began and has continued every fortnight an animated commentary on the conduct of France and the other powers of Europe including a  general and accurate history of the times and drawing the characters of the chief actors in the hurlyburly of this amazing scene His book will be a most valuable source to the future historian and I am happy to inform you that my countrymen have shewn themselves sensible of the merit of such a writer You will find a copy of his work so far as it has proceeded in the literary packet I am preparing for the first safe opportunity In the mean time the passage I have promised and which will be recommendatory of the rest shall now be transcribed  "J'ai laissé le Continent persuadé que l'Angleterre touchoit à sa perte que la France alloit l'engloutir dans ses chaloupes canonnières Les plus courageux en lui accordant la possibilité d'une résistance extérieure la livroient aux fleaux d'une revolution interne l'un gemissoit sur la ruine de son commerce l'autre sur celle de ses finances si l'on admiroit son heroisme on en plaignoit l'inutilité  "Quelle surprise d'observer en debarquant que la guerre la plus terrible à

concorde avec la République Françoise  "C'est avec vaisseaux de guerre mille matelots trois cent mille hommes sous les armes millions sterling versés annuellement par le patriotisme l'opulence la libéralité publique dans la balance des ressources c'est avec des victoires périodiques dont les annales de la marine d'aucun peuple n'avoit encore présenté l'éclat c'est en affermissant tous les ancres d'une admirable constitution à mesure que l'ennemi tente de les soulever que l'Angleterre attend sans crainte comme sans impatience l'issue de ses dangers  "Lorsqu'on voit des flottes innombrables apporter à l'Angleterre les tributs de l'univers renouveller sans interruption la richesse nationale sous la protection d'une force navale devant laquelle les François osent à peine

will gratify your eager desire of attaining a yet greater knowledge of the powers of the English Tongue to read a liberal  translation  of the above into our language whereby you will have a fair opportunity of perceiving the possibility of retaining the  spirit  without licentiously deserting the  letter  of a bold and glowing original The examples certainly bear no proportion to the defects of translation as our  translated Books  like our own  Books translated  generally give you the shadow for the substance and that a  dark  shadow the figure frequently a graceful one mutilated dismembered mangled and the soul wholly left out It is not often indeed that a man who has any force in himself any intellectual energies of his own can be prevailed upon to undertake the comparatively humble office of translation it gives a man of original talents something like volunteering his own dependence it is a sublime painter submitting to copy from a foreign artist instead of employing his pencil in drawing from the rich scenery in his own mind supplied only by nature and art under her controul whether the stores are found in one country or another The consequence is inevitable We have either poor imitations of poor originals whereby nonsense at second hand is exported and imported backwards and forwards in a most unprofitable barter or what is yet worse the legitimate offspring of genius and wit are forced to cross the ocean to be stript on their landing of their native ornaments to be defaced "curtailed of their fair proportions" and exposed in that condition a public spectacle they are then left like bleeding and muchinjured ghosts to wander unsoothed unnoticed round an alien shore or flit indignant back to their native soil  But when there is a just measure and due proportion of genius and ability between an original Author and his Translator when their minds are in a kind of sympathy and their subject is as dignified as important they invigorate and add a lustre to each other One  such  writer finds himself described and pourtrayed by another without having previously communicated They were created counterparts They meet at once as friends and with a kindred sort of delight diffuse each other through the world Hence a Virgil and Homer have to boast a Dryden and Pope and in all such instances the original and the translation travel down the stream of Time together and by changing a single word may be compared to  The sweet breezes of the South  Receiving  and giving odour  At once indebted and discharg'd  MALLET DU PAN and the British public are to be felicitated on the  "Mercure Britannique"  having found such a Translator as Mr DALLAS  The English public are already indebted to this Gentleman for giving it a translation of Mr CLE  Y's Memoirs of the Prison History of the unhappy Royal Family of France while confined and persecuted in the Temple and the characteristics of Mr C's publication simplicity and pathos in the detail of the abhorrent facts are faithfully preserved by the  Trad  eur  To the same pen we likewise owe works of original and independent merit  of whose ability to do justice to his original though the subsequent passage is no unfavourable specimen yet a true judgment can be formed only by an opportunity to peruse the whole and such opportunity I propose to give you by letting the estimable translation accompany as it ought the valuable original  "I left the continent under an apprehension that England was on the brink of ruin and  that France with her gunboats was going to complete her destruction The most confident  allowing her the possibility of an exterior resistance gave her up to the scourges of an internal revolution one bewailed the destruction of her commerce another that of her finances and when her heroism was admired the inutility of it was lamented  "How was I surprised on landing to find that a war the most terrible that any Empire was ever exposed to

been equalled in the naval annals of any nation it is in  securing all the anchors of the admirable constitution the more the more the enemy tries to remove them that England waits without fear and without impatience the issue of her dangers  "When we see innumerable fleets bearing the tributes of the whole world to England and without interruption renewing the national wealth under the

in harmony conspiring to repel the ferocious stranger who menaces their liberty and their happiness we fall on our knees before Providence who gives this living lesson to all nations as a watchtower of help and preservation"  LETTER XIII  HOUGHTON  WITH assenting heart I joined in the harmless merriment of these humble children of nature and after the cheap dedicationI will not call it sacrificeof a single half hour to their festivities I withdrew amidst their blessings to my chamber where having transcribed the impressions I had received I took my walk of contemplation in the park under favour of the Harvestmoon in one of the most balmybreathing evenings I have ever known in England I repassed every object which I had visited in the morning but partly from the accession of interest they had gained by the various circumstances and reflections that had since taken place and partly from the new and more benign aspect they assumed from the  mild influence of that orb which softens every thing within reach of her beams my satisfaction seemed not so much a repetition as an improvement The gentle nightbreeze that whispered amongst the branchesthe majestic foliage whose canopy half admitted and half excluded the moonray which broke into fairy and playful shadows at my feetthe timid steps of the deer as they tripped before methe attempered magnificence yet heightened magic of the Hall where the illustrious persons who had supplied my heart with so many impressive circumstances both within and without the mansion and the lunar survey of that church in which the ashes of those persons reposed combined to produce that feeling of the mind which is the most solemn and perhaps the most salutary To the farthest extent of the scene within sight of the eye or hearing of the ear every thingfor even the zephyr seemed to slumber for a timebecame as still as the silent portraits of the family in the house or the dust of the originals over which I had paused in the church  Going up close to one of the Gothic windows I looked into the church and aided by the moon saw the flat marbles under which the Walpoles were buried as distinctly as by day and in a more awful point of view Of the Prime Minister and the Poet what then remained my dear Baron that could give them "form and pressure" in the mind of a meditative traveller but the image of the virtues and talents they were known to possess in their days of nature and which that mind appreciated Truly may I answer the rest "was leather and prunella" their titles their wealth their honours the loud applauses of the senate and the softer voice of the Muses were lighter than the dust of their crumbling bones in the scale of reflection  Yet a few years thought I and the whole of those merryhearted groupes whom I have just left in a happiness high perhaps as mortals can taste from the strong and mingled emotions of simplicity vivid spirits animated by unusual auxiliaries and a respite from labour yet a few years▪ and these with all the myriads  that at this moment wake or sleep on the bosom of the earth shall like the tenants of that cold spot be covered in its bowels My face was still pressed to the casement and my eye intently directed to the part of the aisle which Jarvis had shewn me could not have gazed more earnestly had I expected that the tombs would have yielded to me their dead It is certain I formed no such notion neither is my imagination sufficiently creative to embody my own thoughts and fears shaping them into skeletons or throwing over them the customary windingsheet of the common people nor their long crape veil and satin manteau no nor the coats of mail nor any other of the prescriptive drapery of the dramatic poets though in this case it would have been dressing them more in character to have given Horace the Bard's velvetcap and loosened shirtcollar and Sir Robert the robes of a Peer of England Indeed a very slight dash of superstition might have helped me to work up as wellaccoutred a pair of sprites as have lately appeared either in print or on the stage  As I stood to view the effect of the moonlight on the four lofty cupolas of Houghton and on the desolated wing of the building which had been destroyed by fire and was yet black from the flame the wonders of Otranto passed across my mind assimilating in some degree with the imagery around me and I should have had as good a  shadow  Forgive the equivoque on the word  shadow  of probability in seeming to see the author of that aweexciting romance rise before me with a magician's wand in his hand as any of the literary conjurers in my country or in yours and the influence of a Prime Minister of State being in the opinion of many more potent than any  other  magician there would have been at least as strong reason to support me had I fancied Sir Robert moving before me in the plenitude of power with more than the enchantments of Prospero  But I was not wrought up to fancy any of these preternatural visions yet if such appearances  had really been permitted this was methought a moment in which my mind would have been best fitted to receive and to welcome them had they 'taken any shape in which they could have been recognized I became interested and even affected by the varieties of light and shade that the sweet planet over my head had given to the objects when walking a few paces backward to survey the exterior of this picturesque little edifice of public worship somewhat of a hardbreathed sigh aroused my attention the sudden movement of a light step several times repeated increased the alarm There came over me a kind of chilling sensation which it is probable even heroes have felt on hearing unexpected sounds after a ghoststory while alone and in the night and though the footsteps were now close behind me I had not resolution to turn round to see from what or whom they proceeded I shifted ground a little more to the other side of the church and the instant I did so I felt the skirt of my coat forcibly struck a hurried movement succeeded This  impelled me to press yet more round to the back of the building where I remained still and silent and with a palpitating breast till I found every thing else so I was beginning to recede when the moon shone on two large dark eyes staring full in my face  Believe me I shall henceforth the less wonder at the force of imagination in others under the influence of certain fears against which no courage can stand prepared It was not immediately I could perceive that over those eyes grew a pair of lofty antlers the property of one of the Houghton Bucks and who had got like myself by stealth into the churchyard The longdrawn sigh heard at first was but the natural consequence of the poor animal's respiration in a comfortable nap and the quick motion which followed merely the natural effect of my own retrograde steps as they approximated the sod he had chosen for his bed and being abruptly driven out of it Thus it is my friend that not only conscience but FANCY  doth make cowards of us all  And thus the native hue of Resolution  Is sicklied o'er by the pale cast of FEAR  It is probable that were most of the ghostly terrours which have so long haunted men's imaginations to be traced from their effects to their causes they would be as humanly accounted for as the apparition of the poor Buck in Houghton churchyard  Yet the mind circumstanced as mine then was does not very readily recover its poise Both at the cause and effect we smile long before we have resumed ourselves The harmless creature that occasioned my late apprehensions seemed to watch the opportunity which my opening the churchgate afforded him of escaping from himself and joining the herd I saw him run eagerly to some of his companions and I have not a doubt but he made them as well acquainted with the adventure and with the alarm I had put  him  to in  his  language as I have explained it to you in mine I will venture to speak yet more positively as to the consolation I am  sure  he received from their  Society I felt that my consolements must be derived from a similar sourceI had indeed no friends to whose bosoms I could resort for immediate relief but blessed be the medium through which our joys and griefs can be communicated from heart to heart and receive returns of sympathy though separated by distant shores and though vast gulphs roll between themI could hasten to my "local habitation" at the King'shead and relieve myself as I have now done by addressing the Baron de B****  LETTER XIV  HOUGHTON  IT will interest you to read whatever can be collected to the posthumous honour of a nobleman whose life was distinguished by so many works of practical benevolence I will not therefore deny either you or myself the pleasure of communicating a liberal and judicious review of his general character from a gentleman who was well acquainted with the valuable qualities that formed it  Such an example of active patronage in the agriculture of an extensive county added to so much unvaunted private bounty cannot be too widely diffused nor too closely emulated It is indeed of more importance to society and goes nearer to the heart than all the catalogues and criticisms of pictures and paintings whether modern or antique from the  imperial palace where the pictorial treasures of Houghton Hall are now transferred to the dismantled gallery of Duzzeldorf thence to dismantled Italy onward to their present revolutionary depositories in Paris Such a cultivator of his native land and such a protector of the useful peasantry that render it productive under his encouraging auspices gives to the part of the earth intrusted to his care a new face to nature a richer form and teaches wealth and industry their wisest lesson  The public papers that have announced the death of Lord Orford have recorded the ancestry from which he was descended the heirs of his honours and the inheritors of his wealth and have dwelt upon the titles that are extinct or devolved together with all the posts and employments that are vacant To me be the melancholy duty says the author  Arthur Young Esq  of this tribute of noting what is of much more moment than the descent of peerage or the  transfer of an estatethe loss of an animated improver of one who gave importance to cultivation by a thorough knowledge of political oeconomy and who bent all his endeavours towards making mankind happy by seconding the pursuits of the farmer and the inquiries of the experimentalist I leave the lieutenancy of a county the rangership of a park and the honours of the bedchamber to those in whose eyes such baubles are respectable I would rather dwell on the merit of the first importer of Southdown sheep into Norfolk on the merit of sending to the most distant regions for breeds of animals represented as useful not indeed always with success but never without liberality in the motive on the patron and friend of the common farmer not the lord of a little circle of tenants but the general and diffusive encourager of every species of agricultural improvement nor did he associate with useful men because he was not qualified for the company of higher classes for his mind was fraught with a great extent of knowledge it was decorated by no trivial stores of classical  learning which carried and set off the powers of a brilliant imagination and thus qualified alike for a court or an academy of science he felt no degradation in attending to the plough  There were it is said strong peculiarities and some shades in this estimable character but they have so little to do with the real and general good to be educed from the parts above stated that you will excuse my officiously gathering them up to send them into Germany or extend their circulation in England Much less shall I allow myself to dwell on the circumstances which clouded several years of his valuable life and which grew alas more and more dark till they brought on the gloomy catastrophe of his death Be it sufficient to say that in that event the British farmer was deprived of a wise instructor the labourer of a generous friend the county of Norfolk of a protector and England of a real patriot without any of the obtrusive claims and noisy pretences to patriotisma word as little understood and as much abused perhaps in all countries as any in language  To the above meritorious nobleman it has been already observed to you that our celebrated Horace Walpole the youngest son of Sir Robert and uncle to Lord George succeeded It has been said very truly that his Royal and Noble Authors and Historic Doubts sufficiently prove his excellence as an English antiquary and how much the most dull and dry subjects in the hands of a man of genius may be rendered interesting and amusing His lighter works are all marked by an easy elegance of style a playfulness of imagination and a delicacy of wit of which kind of writing  I will not add to the volumes written on the charges brought against his Lordship respecting his conduct to  The boy whom once patrician pens adorned  First meanly flatter'd then as meanly scorn'd  because too much has already been said on that subject and perhaps too little proved either in accusation or defence But the lovers of  true  genius will never cease to deplore the untimely loss of Chatterton  he first set the example in England as Voltaire some years before had done in France His Lordship  dying in the th year of his age March the earl Cholmondeley came into possession of the Houghton estate the th of the same month and it could not have devolved into more worthy hands  Houghton village consists of a single street of neat brick buildings uniform both within and without it was erected by Sir Robert for his own appropriate little tenantry and poor From forty to fifty families of this description have here comfortable homes with various indulgent privileges attached and for which that it may not altogether have the air of a bounty they are rated for roomrent at an annual guinea which has for a time long past been received in full by a yearly shilling a mode of payment continued by the present noble proprietor of the town I have conversed with several of the inhabitants sat down in their cottages heard their tales of satisfaction and seeing them all happy am myself the happier It has indeed been a sincere joy to me this morning to observe not only those who had gaily yielded to the brief respite of their toils last night but a  numerous band of others young and old the garrulous Jarvis at their head each crowned with a sickle going with willing hearts and therefore more able hands to begin that harvest which a few hours ago I had heard them so gleefully anticipate I saw them gather into jovial rings the length of their street three deep the centre formed by the men the top part by the women and that nearest the road by the park palingwhich is their boundary gave space for the children Three merry and heartsent huzzas were given and then quitting hands they all started together for the field as if they were rushing to their pastime  Happy harmless beings we commiserate my friend those whom we should gratulate and measure the sum of felicity not by the healthful labour of others but by our own dispiriting indolence I was up with the sun to witness this preparation for hard work The face of that sun though he had risen in splendour looked not more joyous than did the blithe and rosy countenances he shone upon To a man of your unsophisticated feelingto any man who has  a heart and loves his kindit was a sight worth a journey from your German Chateau to the spot in England where scarce two hours ago it delighted your friend  In what spirits did it not send me back to my little inn and what a zest has it given to my pleasant breakfast which instead of taking alone in the room where I had at first ordered it mixed me with mine hostess and her family in her own bar parlour A scene of sadness would have sent me pining into the solitude of my chamber for I derive little solace from making others as wretched as myself when the division of pain is the only good to be expected from its communication But in joyin the fulness of  happy  feelings not to seek and even throw oneself in the  way  of any human creature that has enough of heart to share it unites folly to avarice It hoards the treasure which would accumulate by circulation  And mine hostess  has  a heart and her fair daughter another I described what I had heard and seen a tale of glee and good humour seldom wants a wellnatured hearer and all was  as it should be I had ordered my horse when I found all at once that mine hostess was a poet Whilom she had sung a famous coursing match in Houghtonpark  When  Catch  was deem'd the swiftest dog that run  By whom of course the ladle then was won  And those were two of her verses which for aught I know merit the prize as well as the greyhounds Yea and her Muse had mourned if not amid the inspirings of poesy in the simplicity of truth which is better the death of Lord George  When his just soul on heavenly gales had flown  To regions where no human ills are known  Where ev'ry scene does endless pleasures prove  And all is rapture harmony and love  Moreover a song of her own composing was amongst the joyous tributes of yesterday's conviviality and the poethostess herself has furnished me with a stanza by which you may judge of the rest  Come let us all agree  And join most cheerfully  This day to pass  In honour of our new Peer  May we thus every year  Push round the glass  No bad wish you will say for an innkeeper but I am satisfied the author had no more idea of selflove or selfinterest while she wrote than had the merry mortals who sung and resung her strain Whoever could enter into the sentiment I will be sworn would have been welcome to the most exhilarating accompaniments of her cellar And as for criticism upon the poetry the Cynic whose brow could have wrinkled at the humble efforts of a selftaught happy being in the momentary overflowings of her gratitude ought never to smile again or have  cause  to smile  LETTER XV  ROAD SIDE  between  HOUGHTON  and  FAKENHAM  AFTER you have passed the boundary of Houghton plantations you will meet nothing to win attention from reflections on the past till you reach FAKENHAM if peradventure you do not immediately direct your steps to HOLKHAM unless indeed you should be induced to pass a few minutes at the outskirt of the village of East Rudham and there converse with my poor ANTHONY FLOWER the old man of the gate  Thirty and seven years has this veteran sat as he told me in the capacity of clerk under the minister and every Sabbathday sits under him still "because the minister Sir" says he "will not part with me and because we have  gotten into years together" I am using Anthony's words "GOD be bless'd I can say Amen still and except now and then in the right places and when I don't so cleverly hit it off as I us'd to do master gives me a  nudge  and I am almost sure to have it next time"  He told me moreover that the minister has a fine voice and always marks the closing words of a prayer with more force to serve as a cue to the clerk Anthony has kept a gate which you will find at the end of the town upwards of seven years in Winter he pulls it open to the passengers from a mossed hut which seems a part of himself in summer from the bank where the sods are formed into a pleasant seat and where he can feel that cordial of age the nourishment of the sun He was born in the year eleven and though now demideaf and more than demiblind for he is almost in total darknesshe contrives to carry on his double duties as usual "Yes thank GODold master still likes to have me  pottering  about him Sir" said Anthony "and I fancy he would miss me of a Sabbath if he  did not see me as much as all of the parish would his discoursefor he's a fine discourser and practises as well Ay and I should miss him as much if I did not hear him and I have often said if any body else should sit under him and take away my Amen while I can call it it would go hard with me I am a poor man to be sure Sir but I had rather throw myself wholly on my gategettings than lose my seat under my minister though I should not get a farthing for doing it"  But is it not difficult for you to get either to your gate or your pew Anthony questioned I  "No" he answered "not so much as I might think 'Tis true he was getting feebler and feebler every day and he could not do a  sort  himself but his townfolk were very good natur'd to him because he never did harm to any of them but now and then times are gone a good turn his little granddaughter every night at sunset led him from his gate to the village his wife though to be sure becrippled always made shift hitherto to ring his Sabbath and his burial bells  to chime in and to chime out his little granddaughter would shoot up soon and be able to do more for him in a year or twoif it should please GOD to let him live so long but as he did not like to take up her time now as he lov'd her and paid for her schooling he gave her every twelfth halfpenny he got at his gate and as she was a very good prettylikelooking girl he wished to give her some learning so got one neighbour or another as he went to work to help him to his gate "I was always up betimes Sir" added Anthony "and in my young years as stirring as any of them Why for a  sort  of years I was a carrier and walked twice a week by the side of my cartfor I was almost too proud with such a pair of legs under me to ridefrom Lynn Rudham and other places to Norwich and back again as well and as to wrestling singlesticking and such like few could match ANTHONY FLOWER"  The remains of this man moved at once my pity and my reverence the frame which is now bowed with literally the  weight  of years must  once have measured to the proudest standard of what we call the heroa chosen figure for the field of battleand his limbs though visibly shrunk by decay could still boast a less emaciated sign of the fair proportions of manhood than the attenuated threadlike shadowy forms of some of our dissipated youththey were limbs that measured to the standard of something  more  than the  mere  hero they composed a figure for the field of peace yet as the sword has in every age of the world been alas as necessary as the plough and as the one has been frequently drawn to protect the other it behoves us to do honour to both by entwining the garland of industry with that of glory the cornsheaf with the laurelO my friend that we could in this terrible crisis mingle the olive in our wreath  Pure source of every joy mild concord bring  Each healing blessing on thy snowy wing  Teach the wild storm of ruthless war to cease  And charm the nations to the reign of peace  O may the wish and prayer of the Poet  Henry James Pye Esq in his poem of Naucratia a work equally poetical and patriotic  be soon granted  But I dare not at present trust myself with a subject that to the eye of Pity discolours every scene of the sun that has been shining on my quiet path and cheering every unmolested object within my view from the poor gateman on his bank to the small bird that I now hear whistling near his shed  Blessed sun and blessed country where freedom still adds lustre to his beams In the wide travel of his orb around this his zone of attempered radiancewhere else even on this beauteous day can its inhabitants promise to themselves either the herb which he expands the fruit which he matures or the varied seed which multiplies itself in the abundant earth  The question has the energy of a selfevident proposition and includes its answer  And this Baron is amongst the prime beatitudes of our land In almost every other the establishments of society the arrangement of nations and the harmonies of nature are either broken or destroyed Even in yours my friend they are endangered The Baltic and the Rhine which partially lave your shores only partially defend them and you feel already the difference between a Continent vast and almost immeasurable without a navy and a small insulated speck girded by the ocean which it commands and guarded by the impregnable castles that repel the billow and the foe The visitations which have been inflicted on the territory of your Emperor in the circle of Burgundy and the Belgic provinces and the contributions since the unstable peace in districts bordering on the Lhan without counting the spoliations on electorates palatinates and other principalities have already desolated their beauty and drained the internal treasure of an enormous sum and that only in two campaigns and a third is begun In the mean time our palace and our hut our bounteous fields and  beauteous gardens remain to us "In Britain thank GOD" says an animated writer "the throne stands above the cottage to protect it but its basis is too sound to fall upon and crush it" It looks down benignly upon itit smiles even upon my poor gateman's shed my friend like a tutelary guardian from above  A very short residence amongst us will carry the conviction of these awful truths from your eye to your heart You are coming to us with improved faculties with the partial endowments of nature highly cultivatedand with an expanded soulwith feelings too which an intimate acquaintance with man in different climes and under different governments have instructed and enlarged The wisdom thus collected will prepare you for an early unprejudiced and honest confession and for a full enjoyment of what would indeed inspire in the breast of every foreigner a sentiment of admiration though in some bosoms it would be mixed with envy yet what is envy but admiration in despair In your manly bosom the emotion will be as generous as honourable  A survey of England were you  now  its visitantand could that survey of it be taken even at this perturbed crisisits still uninjured scenery its lifesustaining surface its prospering agriculture its protected arts its guarded commerce and its unviolated propertyhowever hard certain levies on it in this dread season of uncommon exigence and of expedidient may seem to bear on those UNTRAVELLED natives who happily for them have not had and O my lov'd countrymen may ye never havethe various opportunities which you and I my friend and thousands more have but too often possessed of comparing  themselves with others  of being eyewitnesses how much  more  tranquil  more  rich  more  happy and  more  secure in rights in morals in freedom in their treasure their progeny and their religionin all that the ALMIGHTY gives and that man receiveshowever I say the  reverse  of these simple yet solemn facts may by temporary pressures or seductive arguments be imposed on some of those who daily possess though they do not enjoy the blessings of England YOU  will soon be satisfied that neither in this nor in any former sketch however warmly coloured have I indulged in the language of enthusiasm or nationality Yes were you this moment and O that you werethe companion of my way even at this casual restingplace on the public roadcould your liberal eye survey with mine the serenity the plenty the exuberance aroundcould your ear like mine receive the unbroken carol of the woods the villages the fields and listen to the undisturbed minstrelsy of gleeful labour of affection and of joy on this fair day which in so many other parts of the earth dawn'd and alas must close in blood you would feel not only what it is to be a Briton but to be under the shadow of Britannia's wing even in the worst of times  "We have every thing yet to lose" says a powerful writer "we have under our own form of government comfort protection honour security and happiness The price of preserving them is indeed great very great but the price of anarchy of unqualified reform and inextricable confusion would be greater beyond  all calculation We have still many and great resources but the times never called with so loud and so commanding a voice for wisdom discernment and integrity for temperate timely and gradual concession with dignity and security and for an oeconomy rigid and undeviating on the parts of our governors The times call equally for obedience systematic acquiescence under temporary pressure alacrity in defence and vigilance and loyalty and steadiness in all the subjects of this land We have no need of the Roman Armilustrium our arms are purified already Our soldiers are loyal and honourable and without spot They have been weighed in the balance and found perfect And I trust our naval flag will never again wave but in defiance to our enemies"  The flame of this manly and impassioned Author kindles into a kind of glory as he proceeds"I see" continues he "the ancient marks of our country in every loyal countenance I would give life to every one who thinks and who loves our great kingdom and its constitution In times of national distress  Poets have sometimes found means to invigorate the public mind and to confirm its stability I speak indeed of the days of old 'the image of our antique world' But now when the temple and the citadel the worship and the strength and the constitution of our forefathers are to be venerated and defended it is happy that we can trace and find these powers each in their order We may be reminded of all that was depicted in the fabled palace where the deities once assembled in full consistory  Signa tamen divumque tori et quem quisque sacrârat  Accubitu genioque locus monstrantur  "But I fable not We have not the images but the very things before us and the words of poetry are set off by the superior force of truth"  I will offer nothing after this very masterly display of oratory in support of truth but leave it on your heart with the glow it must have produced Let us not degrade such writers whatever cause they espouse by calling them  Partizans They are Philanthropists They are indeed amongst the noblest works of GOD they are honest men  Yet eloquence philanthropy genius and honesty may be associated in the same head and heart The assemblage is rare in any nation but to the honour of ours you will join the following Verses on the character of the  true  POET to the sentiments of the PATRIOTby which word▪ I understand a  real  Lover of his Countryand acknowledge that we have a right in this instance to be proud of their Union  The favour'd BARD  Who nobly conscious of his just reward  With loftier soul and undecaying might  Paints what he feels in characters of light  He turns and instantaneous all around  Cliffs whiten waters murmur voices sound  Portentous forms in heav'n's aërial hall  Appear as at some great supernal call  Thence oft in thought his steps ideal haste  To rocks and groves the wilderness or waste  To plains where Tadmor's regal ruins lie  In desolation's sullen majesty  Or where Carthusian tow'rs the pilgrim draw  And bow the soul with unresisted awe  Whence Bruno from the mountain's pineclad brow  Survey'd the world's inglorious toil below  Then as down ragged cliffs the torrent roar'd  Prostrate great Nature's present God ador'd  And bade in solitude's extremest bourn  Religion hallow the severe sojourn  To Him the Pow'rs of harmony resort  And as the Bard with highcommanding port  Scans all th' ethereal wilderness around  Pour on his ear the thrilling stream of sound  Strains from the fullstrung chords at distance swell  Notes breathing soft from musick's inmost cell  While to their numerous pause or accent deep  His choral passions dread accordance keep  Thence musing lo he bends his weary eyes  On life and all its sad realities  Marks how the prospect darkens in the rear  Shade blends with shade and fear succeeds to fear  Mid forms that rise and flutter through the gloom  Till death unbar the cold sepulch'ral room  Such is the Poet such his claim divine  Imagination's charter'd libertine  He scorns in apathy to float or dream  On listless satisfaction's torpid stream  But dares alone in vent'rous bark to ride  Down turbulent Delight's tempestuous tide  With thoughts encount'ring thoughts in conflict strong  The deep Pierian thunder of the song  Rolls o'er his raptur'd sense the realms on high  For him disclose their varied majesty  He feels the call then bold beyond controul  Stamps on the immortal page the visions of his soul  Such my dear Baron is  this  Poet Patriot and PhilanthropistA man who can thus feel and thus express his feelings illustrating his theory by his practice a teacher of the most sublime art and amongst the very best illustrations of what is to be taught one who has proved himself able alike to point the keen yet polished shaft of satire and to sweep the lyre is privileged even on Mr Pope's axiom  "Let those judge others who themselves excel"  to censure or to praise My own public efforts have slightly or not at all come  under his notice either in the way of eulogy or blame I therefore feel myself the more free to pour forth my sentiments of his high capacities without suspicion of a motive less disinterested than the pure enthusiasm which true genius should inspire and I dare to hope though heaven knows we are all feeble beings had such a Writer been my foeit being scarcely possible he should be an  ungenerous  oneI should thus have yielded to the  general  delight which conviction of  general  excellence would have excited in my heart  Not that I conceive he has always been right in his judgments and for that reason I lay some stress on the repetitions of the word  general  No doubt he has sometimes like other men followed prejudices and partialities Methinks it might be shewn that he has In some cases perhaps his affections and in others his informations may have misled himbut "take him for all in all"in the varied combinations that unite the accurate Critick the man of sound sense the rational Politician and legitimate Poet it is a long time  since we have seen the like of the Author of the "Pursuits of Literature" in OUR World of Letters although we have at all times been as we are now infested by a mongrel tribe usurping by turns all those august characters in the way that a monkey may be said to resemble a man  Yes in sad truth my illumined friend a race we have as noxious as numerous a sorry sort of vermin which not only eject the venom they engender in their own heads and hearts but by a baneful kind of process extract fresh supplies from the sweetest flowers of poesy and from every precious intellectual substance they literally  feed  upon and disgorge  These are amongst the vermin that one of the most brilliant writers England ever had to boast observes "find poison every where take a delight in collecting it and then diffusing it abroad"  A passage from one of Mr Sheridan's speeches in parliament If you will allow me to apply the description of an imaginary to a real person I shall desire you to consider the following sentence as equally characteristic of the fancied hero  HENRY FITZORTON in  "Family Secrets"  for whom it was written and MR SHERIDAN "He has the happy art of rendering every thing interesting whatsoever he touches though dull and drossy in itself acquires by the alchymy of his genius a shining and even sterling quality sometimes discovering ideas light easy and full of fire and sometimes anticipating sentiments more weighty and profound  My estimate of his poetical and  dramatic  genius you already know  Sketch of the Modern Theatre  in the Introduction to Gleanings in Wales c  Of his senatorial talents those who differ from him in political opinion will be unanimous in their admiration of his wit the glow of his eloquence the play of his fancy and the richness of his mind  With perfect adherence to truth and considering the avowed opposition of their public tenets with the most perfect reverence of Genius the author of its "Pursuits" has conveyed in one of his textilluminating notes as  graceful  a compliment to Mr Sheridan as he has perhaps ever received "I am sorry to say that in the realms of wit and humour Mr S is now silent Why is he so politics are transitory wit is eternal" Yet the ingenious writer whom I quote must remember that wit is also universal and enters into all subjects and he will certainly admit that it forms a prominent feature in the political portrait of Mr S  A pause however in his attendance as a statesman has happily for the public amusement been recently and very successfully filled by adapting to our theatre  The Death of Rolla  from your own KOTZEBUE The German literature now and in many but  not in all  respects is deservedly a fashionable intellectual importation of which when opportunity allows I will communicate with you more particularly Meantime which is not often the case if you or KOTZEBUE himself should be in England while the  anglecised  PIZARRO is in its  run  as we call it you would both confess that the laurel of the original should be shared with him who has given it in several parts a brighter hue by transplantation Indeed from the report which I have heard of the German bard's modesty ever a mark of true genius I am persuaded he would himself be the first to divide the wreath with the British one Not is MR SHERIDAN alone entitled to a liberal feeling from the affecting KOTZEBUE An English woman has just claim on him and the fame he has acquired at home is not a little expanded abroad and especially in England by the medium of MISS PLUMTREE's elegant and interesting translations  But of the living writers of my country of both sexes and of whom it has reason to be proudan assertion which I trust I shall support by accumulated proofsa day may come when unwarped by false criticism either of censure or applause I may be able to give you a just estimate of the present intellectual character of the land as it is formed by its late or existing authors What has hitherto been said on this great national subjectcertainly one of the most important that appertains to any empireyou will consider but as passing tributes to particular authors as the topic of the moment makes it necessary for me to anticipate a part of what I have long had in reserve  Thousands of them are  spawned  annually even in that palladium the BRITISH PRESS whence have issued so many fair creations  but the Rose you know nourishes the canker These pests are more thick than the  toads at the bottom of our ditches as dirty too as loathsome and as empoisoned Yet behold the justice of Heaven while for inscrutable reasons they are permitted to operate as a literary plague in every unclean form of Lifemakers Historians Memoirmen Pamphleteers and Paragraphists amidst all the intellectual property and plenty of the landa land flowing with the milk and honey of true geniusour literary Canaanthey usually die of famine not unfrequently indeed destroyed by an excess of their own gall Alas you are no stranger to them on the Continent Even the profound Lavater and the interesting Zimmerman have had their share How many hundred of the miscreant animalcula have viprously crept into the wreathes of our British Bards banquetted on the beauties of which they were formed but died like the bloated fly amidst the sweets  And is it not exulting to see how that which is immortal triumphs over that which is corrupt The spoiler perishes the wreath remains the one is swept like the atom away and of the other not a laurel leaf shall ultimately be injured  Delightful ZIMMERMAN tender empassioned Soliloquist endearing Sage virtuous man How often do thy just and generous reflections animate or soothe me how often does thy high and ennobling sense of Genius and thy proud scorn of its daring yet impotent foes warm my assenting heart more especially when I observe little minds "drest in a petty brief authority" wreaking their malice upon great ones  You Baron have the happiness to enrol ZIMMERMAN amongst your friends his virtues and the sentiments which describe them are familiar to you I cannot have a doubt but the subsequent passage so apposite to what has been just said is amongst the treasures of your memory  "The invectives of the vulgar and the indignation  of the critics are wreak'd in vain against celebrated names and against all those who liberally imitate them Why say each of them to the laughing blockhead would  you  expound the meaning of all that I write since my finest strokes congealing in your mind produce only such frigid ideas  Who are you  by what title do you claim to be keeper of the archives of folly and arbiter of the public taste Where are the works by which you are distinguished When and where have you been announced to the world how many superior characters do you reckon among the number of your friends What distant country is conscious that  such a man exists  Why do you continually preach your  nil admirari  Why do you strive to depreciate every thing that is good great and sublime unless it be from a sense of your own littleness and poverty You seek the approbation of the weak and giddy multitude because no one else esteems you and despise a fair and lasting fame because you can do nothing that is worthy of honest praise but THE NAME's YOU ENDEAVOUR  TO RIDICULE SHALL BE REMEMBERED WHEN YOUR's WILL BE FORGOTTEN"  Letters of gold would be too poor for the sentence that closes this animated apostrophe But it is presented to a rich mind which knows how to feel and to enshrine it  LETTER XVI  FAKENHAM  August    THE remarks which ended the last Letter have kept my mind in the same train of thought during the remainder of my ride even from the flowery and fruitful spot where I began them and before I give you any account of this place you will feel nothing loath I trust in permitting me to go somewhat farther into the subject  The CRITICISM of English Literature can only be of less importance than the LITERATURE itself or will it not be more correct to say it forms a part of that Literature The subject it is true has been often discussed as a SCIENCE in a very masterly manner It has been part even of our school learning and we  have all been taught to reverence the art which directs the human understanding how best to form its judgment and to exercise the powers which principally distinguish the mind of man  From the fountain heads from Athens Greece and Rome sources the most rich and pure flowing in full streams from the Tiber to the Thames we have derived at once the theory and practice of this great and noble artan art which once had and guardedly speaking has still for its characteristic that which one of our English Bishops has given to what real wisdom and judgment will ever consider as the most arduous because the least agreeable part of the critical office "Satire" says this good old pillar of our church  JOSEPH HALL one of the Bishops of Norwich in this county who read the rhetoric Lectures in the Public Schools of Cambridge for two years and distinguished himself as Wit and a Poet in a very early period of his life by the publication of his Satires  The ingenious and very useful compiler of the "Norfolk Tour" has preserved many traits of the virtuous life and literary character of this Prelate and also of his honours abroad and the persecutions he suffered at home of which latter the following is so notable an instance that you will be well pleased with my anticipation of it  Having refused in the Bishoprick of Gloucester he accepted in that of Exeter and in was translated to the See of Norwich but on December following having joined with other Bishops in the protestation against the validity of the laws made during their forced absence from the parliament he amongst the rest was committed to the tower on the th of January but was released in June following upon giving l bail and withdrew to Norwich where he lived in tolerable quiet till April But then the order for sequestering  notorious delinquents  being passed in which he was included by name all his estates real and personal were seized and sold at public sale even says Blomefield to a dozen of Trenchers nor did they forget to lay their hands upon his Ecclesiastical preferments and turn him out of his palace  This eminent Divine it seems was called by Learned Foreigners the English SENECA  In the beginning of his Satires he claims the honour of having led the way in this species of composition  I first adventure follow me who list  And be the second English Satyrist  This assertion of the Poet is not strictly true for there were various satyrical writings previously to his appearance But he was the first who distinguished himself as a legitimate Satyrist upon the classic model of Juvenal and Persius with an intermixture of some strokes in the manner of Horace Succeeding authors have availed themselves of the pattern set them by Hall The first three books were termed by the author  toothless  satires He has an animated idea of the dignity of good poetry and a just contempt of poetasters in the different species of it He says of himself in the first Satire  Nor can I crouch and writhe my fawning tayle  To some great patron for my best avayle  Such hungerstarven trencherpoetrie  Or let it never live or timely die  His first book consisting of nine Satires is chiefly levelled at low and abject Poets Several Satires of the second book reprehend the contempt of the rich for men of science and genius I shall transcribe the sixth being short and void of all obscurity and illustrative of some English manners two centuries ago  A gentle squire would gladly entertaine  Into his house some trencherchaplaine  Some willing man that might instruct his sons  And that would stand to good conditions  First that he lye upon the trucklebed  Whiles his young maister lieth o'er his head  Second that he do on no default  Ever presume to sit above the salt  Third that he never change his trencher twise  Fourth that he use all common courtisies  Sit bare at meales and one half rise and wait  Last that he never his young maister beat  But he must ask his mother to define  How many jerks she would his breech should line  All these observed he could contented bee  To give  five marks  and winter  liverie  From this Satire it is evident how humiliating the terms were to which a private tutor was obliged to submit without much probability of emancipation by the salary of l s d and a great coat  O the comparative difference my friend in this respect between the olden times and these  our  days the trencherchaplain is now thought a fit companion for the splendid table of his gentle squirethe trucklebed is converted to a bed of statethe trencher itself into a plate of silver changed at every dish Instead of waiting half the time in a winter livery he has a score of well  powder'd  well  perfum'd  well  no  egay'd  and well  lac'd  footmen at his command some of whom indeed are appendages of too superb a kind to wear any livery at allthe  Gentlemen of the Gentlemen  so please you and have several little Gentlemen of their own to wait upon  them  before they can be properly  prepared  to wait upon the  great  Gentleman who in turn has peradventure a  greater  Gentleman than himself to wait upon and even that greater Gentleman is in waiting to some greater yet till the scale of  "courtesie"  we will not call it  servitude  shall wemounts up to the greatest Gentleman of all and he alas is obliged in purchase of all this waiting to wait upon every body  And with respect to  tutorage  instead of a l s and penny salaryeven as money was at the time the learned Bishop wrote his Satires two centuries ago in and a great coatif peradventure which is not unfrequently the case the "trencherchaplaine" of these times is chosen to be the trencherchaplain  abroad  in consequence of having "stood to good conditions at  home  or to speak in language more modern if he is advanced from private instructor to the dignity of  Travelling Tutor  the five Marks multiply by hundreds and after having made with the companion of his hopes in the traverse of different climes all that fashion fortune or nature would  allow  to be made of him when in short he returns his charge to the arms of his friends and to the bosom of his country either a finished English gentleman or a finished English blockhead or a sort of mediocre character between both the  Tutorship  glides comfortably into  Annuityship  and a snug three hundred pounds ayear for life with a life interest also in the family table rewards the Sagel ayear why 'tis the price of almost the income of a petty Principality in some other countries with all its wisdom to boot "O the rare days of good Queen Be  " our learned  Clerkes  have been wont to exclaim"O the finer days of good King George" say I when a youth can give an estate for the  finishing  part of his education which too often teaches him nothing more than the easiest way of doing nothing agreeablythe getting rid of himself but we have many splendid exceptionsof whom in order  should be  like the Porcupine  That shoots sharp quills out in each angry line  And wounds the fiery cheek and blushing eye  Of him that WRITES OR READETH guiltily  But we live in days of revolution many of the old English terms such as Patriot Poet  Critic Orator are not yet explained according to their new interpretations though we have  plenty of new dictionary men with our great lexicographer at their headand though the  word  aster  has been joined to each of the above names as patriotaster criticaster c much  might yet be done You know enough of our language to see how easily I might  pun  upon these two adjunct syllables and with the help only of what you foreigners call the  hisser  in our throats the  s  as critic  ass  ter dividing one from the other by a slight hyphen you feel that the appellation would lose none of its force In solemn discussions however we hold punning on this side the German ocean to be inadmissible  Know then my friend that amongst our innovations we have literary statutes at large and codes of criticism in abstract with which the noble art just mentioned has no more to do than with Breslaw's art of Trickery Those  codes and statutes indeed much more resemble the mighty magic of the miracleworker last named than any of the regular bred practitioners of old or of modern times Circumscribed mortals  they  could only work by rule and measure the rule of reason and the measure of right but the critical Breslaws of Great Britain might make Longinus and all other book legislators blush to think they had exhausted so many years in studying a  science  which their successors have proved requires no study nor any science at all Why Sir we have biographers who know only that the subjects of their memoirs were born within the century and if not still alive must certainly be dead but who with these slight materials can story us from the swathing cloaths to the shroud can catalogue the minutiae of soul and body vices and virtues weigh to the fraction of a scruple even to the weight of a split hair or thistledown thrice divided the natural stock of sense and nonsense ascertaining each man's sharein short chartists who draw maps of our morality with our black sea and our red  sea our depths and our shallows our Scylla and our Charybdis and all coloured and discoloured and lined and interlined curved and straightened even like the map of the world itself  Talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentic information for biography Johnson said "When I was a young fellow I wanted to write the 'Life of Dryden' and in order to get materials I applied to the only two persons then alive who had seen him these were old Swinney and old Cibber Swinney's information was no more than this 'That at Will's coffeehouse Dryden had a particular chair for himself which was set by the fire in winter and was then called his winterchair and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in summer and was then called his summerchair' Cibber could tell no more but 'That he remembered him a decent old man arbiter of critical dispotes at Will's' You are to consider that Cibber was then at a great distance from Dryden had perhaps one leg only in the room and durst not draw in the other"  Yea and we have critics who on the like principles and the like stock of ingenuity and information deal wholesale and retail in the trade of lampoonery or panegyric but by a singular inversion of common rules it is a species of fame for an author or for his book to  become the subject of the former and a kind of disgrace to find himself or his composition the  burden  of the latter  Peaceful plunder to all suchYou know the remark of Pope  "Destroy his web and sophistry in vain  The creature's at his dirty work again"  A poetical axiom that has expanded itself through every country and has a place in every memory Its truth indeed will travel down to all ages and continue unimpaired till the earth shall be freed of noxious reptiles But as the animalcula of the mind like those of the air and earth are doubtless among the evils entailed upon us by the Fall and will probably more or less annoy us till our eternal Rise they have I perceive derived a consequence to which they are not entitled even while I have been describing their filthy nature  I have to discourse with your enlightened mind my friend on a matter of more weight as to the office of literary criticism  There cannot be a doubt but that while the liberty of the press as to the freedom of publication shall be sacredand on this side of licentiousness it ought to be uncontrolled it is equally just that the sense and nonsense which indiscriminately issue from the immense vehicle of communication should be subject to vigilant examination otherwise the whole world would be overrun with abortions of the mind We want the assistance of some guides who will take upon themselves the trouble of separating the good from the bad and wade through the troubled deep of literature in order if we may be permitted a continuation of the figure to collect the pearls and gems and to describe the useless weeds whether swimming on the surface or lying at the muddy bottom A stupendous labour if we consider the great disproportion betwixt the former and the latter Applying this to the case in point and it is by no means inapposite a reader unused to such arduous undertakings can image to himself no task so overwhelming as that of being left unaided to  search for instruction in the mass of productions which are every year piled mountain high before him We will even suppose whatever is most beautiful in fancy captivating to the heart and informing to the intellect under his eye but he startles at the view of the enormous  quantity  nor can any degree of excellence in the  quality  reconcile or indeed justify himin a life so brief and so connected with other duties as the presentto the immeasurable fatigue of such a task Even if there should be found a few persevering spirits endowed with a fortitude to peruse all that comes to hand the profit would be no ways answerable to the pain by which it must be procured For this reason it would be proper that there should be some professional inspectors to direct our choice even were literary excellence and defect nearly equal But when the average is on a ratio of at least ninety in the hundred in the scale of compositions  dead weight  there is not perhaps any office so necessary as his who with patient circumspection will examine the great account betwixt  wisdom and folly and settle the balance  It is not therefore possible to conceive a more useful institution than that of a Literary Journal when conducted with various ability and inflexible justice nor can it be denied that a great variety of articles in every branch of literature have been analysed on these principles and a due proportion of good has thence resulted to the community  Numerous as are the critical reptiles abovementioned there are very many writers endued with the perseverance judgment and candour necessary to all the useful as well as valuable purposes I have just stated  We have to boast even at this day of great and noble critics and from most indeed in all of our Literary Journals  It can be known only by the inhabitants of this country and even those must have leisure for reading and some capacity to discriminate and to decide how much a general spirit of good writing is diffused over the British Empire not only by compositions of length of labour and of high character whether of genius or erudition but by the most slight mediums of information amusement and ingenuity Amidst the mass of things with which the Press continually teems "Bornindeed designedlike numberless other created atoms "but just to look about them and to die" there are now to be seen monthly and daily instances to confirm this assertion and a judicious separator of the heterogeneous farrago that mixes with and makes up an English Magazine or Newspaper of the present day might give to the public an annual selection of real worth acceptable not only to readers of one class or profession but of all While our correspondence is at Press I have read two examplesthe one on a subject of criticism the other of our national benevolence "A series of observations on the Poem of the Pursuits of Literature publishing in a print called the "Morning Herald" and an eulogy on our Public Charities in a Sunday Paper called the "Observer"  we find substantial  evidence of unimpeachable judgment and unwarped integrity It is not however to be expected that any human association composed of many members should be conducted on principles uniformly sagacious and correct Were they to write apart and consult together ultimately there must even then often be a clash of sentiment a dissonance of opinion  Yet I am persuaded the critics abovedescribed are the very persons who most reprobate the virulences and regret the errors for which they are made responsible The literary body  cannot be supposed to separate or seem to move a limb independentlymuch less to commit themselves and confederate against each other by deploring the want of candour in some of their colleagues and of capacity in others Thus from their not being associated by congeniality or chosen by consentand yet under a kind of compact to hold together and by the good faith that should be preserved in all treaties bound to support one another in the way of a common causethe errors incongruities adulations and virulences which are observed occasionally to disfigure their journals attach indiscriminately to all  A man must write from the spirit of envy or from pique or ignorance if he assents not to these arguments because there is monthly confirmation of them And of the authors who have individually to complain of uncandid treatment or partial representation there cannot be one who has genius and candour in his own mind and heart but must see and feel there is often just criticism in the very publication where his  own  performance may be slighted or aspersed  If therefore like every other valuable institution abuse has crept into this if prejudice and prepossession too often vault into the chair and instead of its becoming a  Judgmentseat  where the labours of the human mind are to have a fair trial it is frequently a  secret Tribunal  where the judges are wholly unknown and the facts judged so unfairly selected and argued although formed into the most serious charges that the work which ought to be condemned is acquitted and the production that deserves to receive distinguished honoursis by this ungenerous artifice supposed to be guilty of all the imperfections imputed to it  If what by a misnomer is called criticism the mutilated parts of a book are sometimes given as specimens of its general character If in offering an author's argument without reference to the contextby which alone its force or feebleness is to be determinedthe most important and admirable reasoning is torn from its antecedent and consequent like a limb hacked from the body and presented in a mangled state to serve as a measure for the  harmony and beauty of the whole  A perfect judge will read each work of wit  With the same spirit that its author writ  Survey the WHOLE nor seek a fault to find  Where Nature moves and rapture warms the mind  Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see  Thinks what ne'er was nor is nor e'er shall be  In every work regard the writer's end  Since none can compass more than they intend  And if the means be just the conduct true  Applause in spite of trivial faults is due  Learn then what MORAL Critics ought to show  For 'tis but half a judge's task to know  'Tis not enough taste judgment learning join  In all you speak let TRUTH and CANDOUR shine  POPE's ESSAY ON CRITICISM▪  or if which is not more generous or reasonable a frequently licentious sometimes malignant display is made of illgrounded  ridicule  a power by which all things the most grave and sacred however happy they may be in their conception and deliveryare discoloured distorted tending to excite the very reverse impression of that they probably  would  have made on a mind unseduced by the intemperate sally of misapplied or illtempered witand all this to indulge  the miserable propensity of raising a laugh against what even at worst is perhaps the best effort of its author to please the public and who possibly in the bitterness of his disappointment weeps not only over the loss of that daily bread which the scorner earns by his taunts but which the industrious author has often earned more honestly than his critic if while it must be owned there are numberless objects which deserve to be assailed by all the powers of wit this dangerous talent snatches the honest morsel from the lip of Genius for the paltry triumph of saying "a good thing" if those compositions which deserve our reverence and which perhaps have delighted even the defamer himself privately have nevertheless been publicly sacrificedIf the attempt to turn performances of indubitable merit and labour into ridicule  There is perhaps in the nature of wit a proneness to mischief which by indulgence grows to an inveterate habit Perhaps there is in human nature itself a turn for the ridiculous but in generous minds this propensity is corrected and meliorated till strong occasion invites it Our  enemy  could not suddenly sprain his ancle within our view but a kind of irresistible pity would impel us to step forward to his assistance but if it were waggishly represented even that a  friend  in falling from his horse had disordered his wig dropt it from his head or any other way ludicrously exposed himself we might join in the laugh till we discovered the nature of the accident though be should have broken his leg  by shewing them under  absurd circumstances is but too successfully practised If "the sovereigns of Reason and the artificers and purveyors of our most exquisite pleasures"  The acute and animated Mr D'ISRAELI  those of the intellect are unquestionably of that orderif the rightful Critic upon the human understanding is by the common and inevitable lot of all corporate bodies thus unfortunately mixt with those critical usurpers who with pontifical pride fulminate their defamatory bulls against Genius and Learning in ignorant pomposity or in rude impertinence If such accusations are well founded depend upon it those who are the true protectors advocates and guardians of Literaturethe TRUE criticseven while by a sacred duty they are constrained to reprehend punish or wholly condemn some of the  votaries of science and the Muses  they  are the persons most touched and aggrieved whenever the numerous pettifoggers of Literature any of those unprincipled usurpers with whom by imperious circumstances they may be blended have perplexed or lost the cause of real Genius or Learning The verdict it is true is always given by the PUBLIC our Literary Grand Jurybut if by false reasoning or false impression by partial evidence or by corrupt influence it is practised upon and misguided the sentence would of course be unjust though it might have the sanction of a majority of the council and of the judges  It is the advice of LONGINUS to the Poet that on perusing his composition he should seriously ask himself whether on such an occasion HOMER would have written such verses It seems no less expedient for a Critic to consult his own heart and ask whether LONGINUS would confirm his judgment and ratify his opinions But when we reflect on the great masters of antiquity their chaste and simple yet bold and animated criticisms the  soundness of their judgment and the extent of their erudition who shall forbear blushing for the petty cavils and peevish puerilities of our times It were to be wished that such Critics and such Judges would remember the fate of ZOILUS for though they may seldom have a HOMER to criticise they may discover equal ignorance and equal malignity in analyzing even the dullest of his commentators  With respect to READERS there is a feebleness in the mind that has been warped by early dependance It has so long been under the dominion of others that it fears to judge for itself like childhood in leadingstrings or age under its crutches we often tremble to walk alone and know not the degree of our intellectual strength They who have been accustomed to take up the opinions of others seem even to forget they have a  right  to form any of their own and in cases of literary judgment so far from asserting any independency they are afraid either to praise or blame to be pleased or angry till they learn from the higher powers how far they  ought  to approve or  condemn And it is well known that many persons neither venture to purchase nor even to peruse a book till they have seen what these arbiters of the intellect say of it nay such is the degree of subjugation in which these despots hold some of their slaves that I have personal knowledge of a man of no mean understanding who confessed his vassalage was at one time so extreme from the force of habit and the want of fortitude that his impatience to read a work of which the title had attracted him and feeling it impossible to wait for the permission of his judges he had the temerity to be delighted on the authority of his own emotions but soon repented of his rashness a decree was issued against the performance on the first day of the succeeding month the adventurous Reader  You acknowledged the receipt of and honoured me with your sentiments upon the new edition of a novel wherein I had the hardihood to interweave subjects of greater strength than are usually admitted into that species of composition I intended it as an  experiment  and to say it did not succeed would be ungrateful to general criticism as well as to the public Yet to the majority of Readers by whom works of that sort are most appreciated and who require a rapid story wherein the heart may indulge its affections without check or controul it was suggested to me the work might be more acceptable were the progress of the fable less impeded I accordingly disencumbered the subsequent edition of all irrelevant matter reserving to myself however the privilege of introducing the literary discussions in some other place Our correspondence my friend offers that place and the subject immediately under consideration will I trust derive some light from the following dialogue abridged from what appeared in the edition  Family Secrets  preceding that I had the pleasure to send you  "In relief of the serious studies came in the intellectual amusements of the three brothers  John James and Henry Fitzorton  The juvenile muse of the younger by her light and playful sallies pleasantly contrasted and agreeably set off the more solid not to say solemn meditations of John thence indeed and from an early sorrow the very sports of the latter took an aweful turn He read the poets as a relaxation from the philosophers yet he read them not as an enthusiast but as a critic and therefore detected more faults than beauties Henry on the other hand with all the ardour of poetic passion read as he wrote to be delighted and so found more beauties than faults he was too much in love with the muse to look severely for or at her little inconsistencies and as is the case with all lovers was too sincerely smit with the charms of his object to be angry at her foibles  "This dissimilitude in their opinions however was a fresh source of amicable contention  "Ah how do I wish my dearest father" said Henry after giving the matter a little rest "that you would deign to settle our everjarring opinions on this subject Yours have indeed been already favourable but John I perceive wants constant repetitions of high authority to make him think well of any art but his own" "I admit what you have related brother to be poetry" replied John "and some of its fire has reached me but there is no degree of authority can make me an  advocate  for palpable absurdity whether in life or literature in verse or in prose though the undue exercise of such authority which I can never have to fear from our father might make me silent"  "John bowed respectfully to Sir Armine who took his hand cordially and smiled kindly on Henry "You must not my Harry" said the impartial James "suffer your name to be catalogued amongst the irritable race nor must you my dear John be ranked amongst the snarlers of the day From true criticism a poet should not shrink and false can ultimately do him no harm Let John's censure therefore rather animate Henry to triumph over what may be hypercritical and to remove from his composition what may be really objectionable" "In the days of youth" said sir Armine"they are commonly days of intrepidity I was myself you must know hardy enough to writeyea and to write a romance"  "A romance Sir" questioned John "Verily a romance" answered his father "Where is it Sir what is its name I never heard you mention it before" observed Henry earnestly "I can easily conceive the reason of that" cried John significantly "You think" said Sir Armine "I was ashamed of having misemployed my time" "The wisest youth hath its indiscretions Sir" observed John respectfully "Had it been a treatise on Philosophy it would not have been thought indiscreet I dare say" cried Henry tartly looking at John "and I have not a doubt but my dear father had every reason to be proud of it" continued Henry "In truth neither proud nor ashamed" replied his father "You shall hear when I had written my romanceit really was a romance John there is no denying it I felt curiosity to collect the private sentiments of acquaintance upon my labours""Labours Sir" interrupted John drily "Yes labours son John there may be serious labour in giving the ease of nature to every work of art In case the general sense of a private circle had been against me prudence I had hope might prevail with vanity" John shook his head "to take warning from the 'still small voice' of limited disapprobation without provoking the clamour of public censure" And as to criticism every body is naturally more or less a critic in whatever respects the emotions and passions of human nature and the joy or sorrow of human life Nay every family is a little  world  of critics  "Brother James" cried Henry "how can you be reading that abominable Wood's Institutes at a time like this when my dearest father is just beginning to read his novel"  "In the progress of reading" continued Sir Armine "I experienced all that can be exhibited of human variety in human opinions The favourite passage or character of one hearer became the furious objection of another some approved only of the  pathos  others yawned and nodded in the midst of it These again were awaked by a laugh which threw my pathetical admirers into the vapours Some objected to the length some to the brevity trash trumpery stuff nonsense obligingly echoed one of the partyDelightful charming incomparable resounded another fair auditor  "And pray Sir" questioned Henry sighing "what in this perplexing counteraction of judgment did you do"  But from an impotence or timidity of a Reader's judgment and his dependence on that of others many very promising productions of young writers are never read after the Critics have proscribed them  "I considered that if a composition deserved to travel down the stream of time unjust criticism would not long obstruct its course That which is imperishable in its own nature shall assert its immortality amongst things immortal nor can any degree of elaborate panegyric restore to life what oblivion has swept away at the command of reason and truth"  "Ah I feel the sacred truths Sir" cried Henry "but methinks I should have lost all confidence in myself and dropt the trembling pen"  "I would have held mine the faster or mended it" rejoined John "if I found it worth the pains if not I would have thrown it away and taken up a more useful instrument"  "Alas I fear I should have renounced the press at once" said Henry "No doubt" retorted John "there are cowards enough in the world and their fine timidity may for aught I know be a mark of genius but give me the soul rough determined and if you will inelegant which like the mountain pine however it may for a moment bend to the blast rises again as often as it is assailed"  "I have wondered at nothing more" replied James "than at the unfair dealings of readers with authors"  "Authors with readers I believe you mean" quoth John  "Rather" continued James "it is matter of surprise to me that considering the injustice of readers there should be any authors at all"  "Now you have mended it" cried John  "James has reason on his side notwithstanding" said Sir Armine  "It appears to me Sir" answered James respectfully "that the  golden mean  finds as few friends amongst books as among mena certain extravagance pervades all things Every reader more or less exercises the tyranny of a critic if the work happens to be adapted to the degree of his capacity and modes of feeling no panegyric seems warm enough if it be written above or below that capacity those modes or different from his general idea or particular experience or the temper of the moment there is not any censure deemed strong enough to condemn it  "Were I to be desperate enough to write another book" said Sir Armine "methinks I would try a new experiment I would write up to the capacity and feeling of half a dozen persons with whose different dispositions I had acquaintance for argument's sake we will suppose the characters to stand thusa philosopher a poet a divine a humourist a politician and a man of the world for each of whom I would prepare some essay treatise or poem suitable to their respective genius But agreeably to the design I had in view I would so arrange these that presuming each to be excellent in its kind two very contrary effects should be produced by that arrangement The book being ready I would take care that the six persons for whom it was intended should be summoned to a private recital in a more finished and select way than before I would commence my experiments on the humourist delineating that singularity whim or weakness in mind or manners in which he would most delight but which my man of the world would pronounce 'execrable stuff' the philosopher'beneath the dignity of the human understanding' the poet 'despicable' the divine 'frivolous' the politician 'absurd' I would then make an attempt upon the rest indiscriminately and should certainly find that the pleasure of one while his favourite subject was before him would have a nearly contrary effect on the others until in the end each man would depart with a favourable impression of the work not because it might be  generally  excellent but because the particular taste and perhaps predominant passion of each had been gratified Were you the next day" continued Sir Armine "to hear the philosopher passing his opinion on the performance to any friends of his own description he would tell you there was one essay worth all the restThe bard would recommend it to his brethren of the laurel purely for the poem The politician for its happy strokes at ministry or the opposition The divine for its polemics The man of fashion for its elegance in trifling and the humourist for that display of character which though seen every hour in life is always welcome to men of his disposition when found in books Thus if every book could be ushered into the world with such an experiment the reading of it would be general but my complaint is that were such a book to be placed in the way of six such readers  separately  without a table of contents to anticipate the subjects and should it happen that the order in which the book was opened presented the philosophy to the humouristthe divinity to the man of fashion the airy pleasantries to the divine the politics to the bard and the poetry to the politician my poor book would call forth more vengeance against it than was ever fulminated at a miserable culprit from that book of pious cursesthe Romish excommunication"  "Your quarrel with readers then Sir" said James quietly "is for their want of candour and of patience You would wish them to begin dispassionately to sit down to their author with a mind disposed to be pleased and proceed to the end before they passed judgment Just as we do in legal affairs And there ought to be courts of justice no doubt in literature as well a in law"  found out that his untutored nature had yielded to impulses unsanctioned by his tyrants and on  a second perusal he discovered how very hasty he had been in pronouncing that to be simple  tender and elegant which his critics had proved by a variety of instances and which they would  probably have undertaken to prove against Nature herself  At the same time it must be owned professional critics have a hard task to perform  even when their fund of candour and sagacity their heads and hearts are equally rich Consider  my friend their drudgery How often are they condemned to waste the most precious of all things  in this brief worldtime and temperon what frequently cannot repay the attention of a single hour The pious Roman deplored pathetically the loss of a single day the English professors of criticism have to bewail the consumption of months and of years And though by a long habit of reading with design to analyze they may acquire a facility of seeing the force or feebleness of a subject we frequently perceive the most painful internal evidence of their having honestly but laboriously waded through and even plunged profoundly into the troubled waters of ignorance and vanity without even finding one drop of wit or wisdom at the muddy bottom And how many a weary league on the waste land of literature must they pass even after they have emerged before they arrive at the realms of poesy realms where they may purify in streams of the genuine Castaly and luxuriate amongst flowers of the true Parnassus or hope to taste of those ripe and rare fruits which adorn the groves and gardens of true philosophy  But O how sweet you will exclaim must be the recompence when after all their toils the lettered adventurers reach those enchanting climes True my friend harassed and disappointed can we be surprised if sometimes the best critic and best tempered man should be too much fatigued with labouring over barren ground and fretted at meeting disagreeable or disgusting company by the way he should for a while be indisposed to enjoy more fertile land or more beautiful scenery He has escaped as from a wreck and wishes for nothing so much as a resting place even were he thrown upon the treeless heath or unsheltered beach  Our writers therefore must participate the blame with our critics and thus even the most valuable of the former must sometimes be content to receive a slight if not a wound from the most just and honourable of the latter But this can rarely happen and we are still for the most part to attribute bad criticism of good composition to bad critics  and if they depreciate  willingly  not  ignorantly  even to bad men Literary property to speak of it only as it refers to genius and honour exclusively of labour or reward is certainly as important and as dear as any that may be called our worldly substance Ought it not then to be as sacred "He who filches from us our good fame" is a robber and as the treasures of the mind may be taken like our purses by assassins under a mask and as even our English laws have provided no punishment for an apprehended offender  this  way except for the poor and comparatively innocent thief who steals our intellectual children to deface and mutilate them gypsy fashion that they may very well pass for  his  ownas moreover there is no award of damages in relief of the sufferers and amongst all the great public works as we have no literary  scandalum magnatum  nor even one poor clause in favour of defrauded authors in our  black acts  though a wanton critic should plunder a man of genius not only of reputation but of breadand as notwithstanding the general impotence of false  criticism this must sometimes have been done a reform in LITERARY ESTABLISHMENTS would certainly be another grand national object of this country and it is a great pity insurmountable difficulties are in the way of it  Yet as the whole world is now said to want a reform and as there are luckily more reformers than there  can  be defects to whatever number the latter may amountmost likely a hundred reformers to a single defectand as every reformer has been and continues to be hard  very  hard at work with his voice his pen and his swordall powerful weaponswhy it may be hoped that when every thing else is in the state of PERFECTION to which many of the religious and all the political prophets of the age assure us all things are advancingyea with the strides of a giant though every stride those prophets cannot but allow have been and must still be made in human gore while battle murder and sudden death must rally round the standard of reformation and the desolating  angel  should I not write DEMON brings up the rear with nothing but a ruin  for the trophy and a blooddropping laurel to mark the progress or grace the triumph of the  spirit  of PERFECTABILITYstill I say Baron we may hope that even authors yea and critics may come in for some few of the good things in the new land of promise Indeed when whatever is wanted in ethics politics and religion shall be supplied and when every thing that is now crooked in a world which has so long had a twist shall be made straitwhen in fine we are to be made  perfect upon earth  a privilege we have been blindly taught for three thousand years was a work reserved  for heaven  it would be hard indeed if literature should not be entitled to a share  Animated by this joyful hope and I am sure you see the reasonableness of it as clearly as myself we must be content to receive all things with the old leaven and to accept of bad with good authors and critics in this bad good but it seems  perfectionizing  world  Yet while that world and this small but lovely part of it contains a true friend fixes a  sentiment of honour in the mind an emotion of tenderness in the heart displays a warm sun over our heads and spreads a fair expanse of generous land at our feet I shall in proud but reverential imitation of the great Bestower continue to see that "IT IS GOOD" and most gratefully bless the Giver and the gift  P S Since the time of sending these letters two new literary journals have been established and both have begun their career under every fair and favourable auspice Their plan is generous their professions liberal and if their practice continues to confirm them they will prove a valuable addition to the national stock of just criticism while they serve at the same time as a farther atonement for what is disgraceful to literature and its guardians The one is called the "ANTIJACOBIN REVIEW and  Magazine  or  Monthly Political and Literary Censor  and the other the "NEW LONDON REVIEW or  Monthly Report of Authors and Books"  My promised parcel shall enclose the numbers which have hitherto been published of both You will receive them as specimens  of their respective pretensions They propose to accomplish the same objects and on the same honourable principlea determination to counteract the designs of those writers whether Reviewers or others "who labour to undermine our civil and religious establishments and to restore criticism to its original standard"  AntiJacobin  "to notice in terms of severe and unequivocal reprehension whatever disturbs the public harmony insults legal authority outrages the best regards of the heart invalidates the radical obligations of morality attacks the vital springs and established functions of piety or in any respect clashes with the sacred forms of decency however witty elegant and otherwise well written"  London Review  To furnish in short an honest and exact report of what is passing among those engaged in the pursuit of Science and polite Learning and to give such a picture of it in its present cultivated state as may do honour  to the English Press and such as men of polished and enlightened minds delight to contemplate  Inasmuch as the new journalists shall effect such noble ends by such laudablemeans they will not only reflect credit on themselves but deserve well of their country they may then indeed call their work registers of domestic literature animated by a spirit of manly and liberal criticism and they will materially contribute to illustrate the sentiment which the new London Reviewers have chosen for the motto of their prospectus "Reviews show the progress of a country or an age in taste and arts in refinement of manners and in the cultivation of science They mark the gradation of language itself and the progressive or retrograde motions of the public mind upon the most interesting subjects in ethics in politics and religion"  Were I not fully persuaded you will  read  this terse and polished sentence with the liberal spirit yet limited sense in which it must have been  written  by the very learned and ingenious author DR PARR one of the chief ornaments  of eruditionI should desire you to place the  helping  verb  should  between the first and second words of the passage to signify the  time  WHEN the golden age of pure criticism shall return not admitting we now enjoy it unreservedly  LETTER XVII  FAKENHAM  August    THERE is not much to be said for this small town but the little that truth affords will be to its advantageCompact neat and agreeable are its epithets The environs are in a part of the county which corresponds to this engaging character and at the distance of a few miles you are presented with beauties of a very distinguished kind In its vicinity is RAINHAMHALL very deservedly enumerated amongst the beauties of England Amidst other capital paintings that of Belisarius by Salvater Rosa has been particularly noticed It is said to be the gift of the GREAT Frederick of Prussia ARTHUR YOUNG whose Tour into this county is published and which I recommend to your  attention particularly the part which treats of the Norfolk husbandry has marked Mr STRANGE's print from this painting as admirable though there is a doubt amongst the connoisseurs whether after all the original picture represents Belisarius or Caius Marius It is not without good reason that another Tourist has preferred the  situation  of this mansion to that of any other in the county and he justly observes that the country around is rich and  comfortlooking  The park and woods have been estimated at about acres and the house itself has the advantage of being built under the superintendance of Inigo Jones The river on which the town stands might probably be called  Faken  part of which word anciently denoted water as HAM in the time of the Saxons did a dwelling  But there is something better than the finest edifice that the abovenamed great architect has left us as a memorial of his artsomething more delightful to the traveller even than glassy lakes vivid lawns or luxuriant woods the urbanity and benevolence of its present  noble possessor By means of the first quality every stranger who has the air and manners of gentleman may become a guest and by virtue of the last all whose deservings are at all known may become its object and those who have claims upon that benevolence on the simple recommendation of poverty or the more sacred one of misfortune will have their claims allowed This is not only a countycharacter but a good name that gathering wellearn'd plaudits as it goes spreads to the remotest part of Great Britain and in the course of a long and estimable life must have travelled into more distant lands  The Marquis has filled many great official situations with honour to himself and service to his country With a great share of facile wit he commixes a yet greater proportion of goodhumour and if you should encounter him in any of the walks or rides around his domain he will soon make you forget that you see him for the first time or that you have been introduced to him only by the affability of his  own  disposition  I thus delineate him my dear Baron on more powerful testimony than my own or that of any individual He is amongst the few whose domestic and public reputation may be trusted toin general a very faithless historian common report and although I know him but by a transient view I have so long been in the habit of hearing him spoken of by persons of very different minds that whenever by any accident he has met my eye I have looked at him with as much conscious feeling of being intimate as if I had  seen  the transactions which have built up the fair superstructure of his character  The celebration of Marquis Townshend's birthday a few months since in Ireland was one of the most brilliant and at the same time the most truly affectionate to that excellent Nobleman which has occurred in the course of thirtyone years since his friends established there this annual tribute of gratitude the recollection of political benefits is seldom longlived and in ordinary cases personal affection does not often survive so many years of absence yet we see in the instance of Lord Townshend the recollection of public services cherished even by the  children  of those on whom they were conferred and esteem for his private worth evinced by men who could only have learned it from the sincere and grateful testimony of their fathers  So happy and so unanimous a company as that of March the Anniversary of the Marquis is not often to be met the occasion seemed to inspire every man with cheerfulness  Amongst the toasts which

Marchioness Townshendin beauty virtue and conduct the ornament of her sexAnd the different branches of the family of this venerable and amiable Nobleman  nay seen its basishis generous heart  "FAKENHAM" says one of its old describers "is famous for nothing but for having had saltpits formerly"but a young historian of the place whom I have just met assures me it can at present boast of something else My intelligencer is a female whose prompt but apt reply to my question occasioned the following information the truism it contains is not diminished by being in verse even though composed on horseback and in a canter I beg to call it  THE RULE OF THREE  "Whose house is that my pretty lass  All fine and  red  with wings so wide  So gay one cannot by it pass  And that so  white  on t'other side  "And that my dear which doth uplift  Its head so high be tow'r'd at top"  "There please you Sir dwells parson Thrift  Here Lawyer Claw there Doctor Lopp"  This answer Baron serves for all  Sure as there's physic gospel law  In every town at which you call  You'll find a Thrift a Lopp and Claw  And such this lucky Trio's lot  When you have journey'd England round  You'll see that it has always got  The three best things on English ground  Best  house  best  living  and best  pay  And e'er you thrice three leagues have been  I thrice three pounds to one will lay  You'll note the lucky Wights I mean  Are Doctor Lawyerman and Priest  Worthies I ween decreed by fate  On  thrice one  more best things to feast  On  mind  and  body  and  estate  But if as sometimes you will view  To body a fair face should join  That  takes the lead of t'other two  With Lawyer Doctor and Divine  Though still observe the wights agree  So zealous is their guardian care  To part between them  all

the mind  That load they take and Priest will tell  What makes the penniless still even  Gold often leads the rich to hell  Quoth hethe poor go light to heaven  Then as for physic when your breath  Is all that's left 'twixt skin and bone  Doctor can serve you after death  And save your very  skeleton  Laud then O muse the generous three  Who on themselves take all our evil  Keep from the wormsthe body free  And the soul rescue from the devil"  It seems worse than a slight an injustice to nature and to arta neglect of some of their best displays in this fair country to pass unnoticed the mansion and domain of MR COKE at a short and beautiful ride from Fakenham The truth is I paid my visit to these under the most unfavourable circumstances first from ignorance or rather forgetfulness that the house is open to public curiosity only one day in the week Tuesday and I was luckless enough not to select that one a circumstance however which would not have been an interruption to  you  my dear Baron because foreigners have an exception in their  favour I had still you will say the most inviting part of the property before me  All that is out of door  Most rich  but disappointment likes company you know and did not on this occasion come alone A fairseeming day broke its promise to me and scarce allowed one lucid interval that I could rely on and whenever I did though deceived before put my trust in a smiling moment to glance over the ample park the twentyacred lake and the embellishing plantations I was soon taught the rashness of believing in appearances and forced to take shelter under some of the majestic trees till even  they  poured down their vengeance on my head and I was glad to seek the more solid protection of an exceeding good inn which offered an invitation I very gladly accepted  There however the very circumstance I had been lamenting was the means of my gaining some particulars which neither sunshine nor shade could so soon have procured  When the storm "is pitiless" the nearest asylum becomes welcome On entering the inn I found it filled to the gateway and outhouses as well as the passages of the house with people of as different manners as sizes The historians of the moment were numerous and dealing forth their knowledge to a listening party which I remembered to have seen in the park and which like myself had been tempestdriven out of it for the showers were not more sudden than severe It is pleasing to gather a man's character from a groupe of persons thus assembled Their sentiments are as spontaneous as the occasion that brought them together They are therefore to be depended upon more particularly where those who dissent essentially on one point are unanimous in others of at least equal importance Of these delineators of the mind and manners of the present proprietor of HOLKHAM though there were many who thought altogether differently and more than one who was in avowed opposition to him in what is supposed to be his politicsa difference in which even the nearest  bonds of consanguinity and the dearest ties of friendship are often sacrificed in this country they perfectly agreed in describing him as one whose possessions of fortune were not more estimable not more splendid than those of his heart the benignity of which indeed gave them their highest value and use "If a landholder cannot thrive upon one of MR COKE's farms and pay his rent into the bargain" said one of my weatherassociated biographers "he must be a sot or a prodigal and if there are any persons in Holkham or in any of the parishes where this gentleman has property who  can  be truly called  poor  folks whether they can labour or not it must be where it would not only be a weakness and almost a wickedness to encourage them" "That I believe every one in any of those parishes will allow" observed another "and as to his friends" added this last describer "they may be as much at their ease at Holkham house as if they were at home and I have heard many gentlemen say if they find any difference it is in the attendance and attention being more constant and watchful there than in their own houses"  "Norfolk is fortunate in this respect" remarked a gentleman who had not taken any part in the conversation before He then spoke of some whom I have already mentioned and adjoined the amiable owner of NARFORD then by a most unexpected transition and in a most pointed manner he contrasted those worthies by describing a very reverse character one whose immense property neither afforded happiness to others nor to himself who sought solitude without any apparent relish of its wise or sacred powerswho shrunk from the eye of the traveller with as much haste as the Lord of Rainhim advanced towards itwho even shunned the face of day and travelled in the most heartrejoicing season through the finest countries usually by night while his estate yeomanry peasantry and neighbourhood exhibited the marks of an unsocial man" Possibly my friend an unhappy one and if so alas he may be tryingit is to be feared vainlyto escape from himself And although no doubt the best and the most blessed way to soothe us even under this evil is to occupy  ourselves in the good of others to spread the industrious over our fields and gardens to give new beauties to the earth and fresh bounties to its poorer inhabitants to command the artist to display his talent while he augments its just reward to make nature herself more rich more lovely and at length beckon honourable friendship to mark our improvements while faithful love has seen and assisted their progress or invoke  active  contemplationand may I not be suffered so to call the study or the science that in a condition of hoarded sorrow keeps us beneficially employed though these are certainly the most wise and the most salutary means of forgetting ourselves or of obliviating what we wish not to remember of others yet not the habits only but the temperament the Indolence or the inveteracy which sometimes character the effects of grief or result from its causes may prevent applying to such lenitives or receiving from them any solace In such cases without knowing how far they may apply in the present shall we not deplore the state of a human being thus  shut by his own hand into a prison which however splendid to the passenger has the darkness of the tomb to the selfdevoted and shall not pity though uninvited follow him there  The weather continued equally unpropitious during the whole day and evening and having an early engagement for this morning I have been obliged to leave HolkhamHouse and its varied attractions unexamined by my own eye The eyes of so many observers have however been so long upon it that there can be no other difficulty in presenting to you a description but what arisesfrom not knowing which to prefer  One great feature of objection indeed which I cannot but feel against the very sight of  fine places  upon  paper  arises from the repetition of the very terms by which they are described Varied and abundant as is our language a whole warehouse of words a magazine of epithets are soon at an end when we come to five quadrangles four wings and a centre saloons of fortytwo feet by twentyseven drawingrooms thirtythree by  twentytwo  and a statue gallery of which the middle part consists of seventy feet by  twentytwo  and at each end an octagon of  twentytwo  with whatever of rich and rare can be put into these by the hand of fortune or arranged by that of taste which is I understand with as few exceptions as may be the case at HolkhamHouse The words  beautiful fine sublime light magnificent brilliant elegant  and  exquisite  are forced upon such hard yet necessary duty that the only chance one has of not being sickened of looking at them is if possible to vary their position so as not to make them come too thick and fast upon us in the same order  "The house may be said to consist of five quadrangles the centre and the four wings not that they are squares but we use the term to give a general idea Each of the two fronts thereof present a centre and two wings That to the South and the grand approach is as  beautiful light airy  and  elegant  a building as can be viewed The gilding of the window frames and sashes of this front done in by the present Mr Coke gives it a  magnificent  appearance The portico is in a fine taste and the Corinthian pillars  beautifully  proportioned This central front in every respect that can be named appears all  lightness elegance  and  proportion"  This is all very true I dare say as also what is said of the saloon"that it is in an  elegant  taste the pier glasses exceedingly  elegant  the agate tables  beautiful  the state bedchamber by fitted up in a most  elegant  style that the colours of the tapestry are  brilliant  the chimneypiece remarkably  beautiful  the figure of the Diana in the statuegallery is  fine  and the turn of the arms  inimitable  the Venus also in the wet drapery and the form of the limbs seen through the cloathing  exquisite  neither can it be denied that the fitting up the house in all particulars is in the highest degree  elegant"  But the reverberation of the epithets though perhaps inevitable return so rapidly not only in the above description but in almost every other they seem to have the mockery of the echo without its sweetness the routine of the  parrot without her drollery and have sometimes brought to my mind the mountebank orator with his  "Walk in ladies and gentlemen walk in and see what you shall see  the most beautiful tygerthe most amazinglyastonishing fine leopard and the most magnanimously magnificent lion that was ever shewn in Europe" Then running the stunning eloquence back again with no other relief to the ear than beginning with the lion and ending with the tyger  You enter into the  spirit  of an observation too clearly and with too much candour to imagine that I wish to depreciate the real grandeur or beauty of this noble mansion or its domain which is universally ranked amongst the  triumphs  of the island Indeed the inside of the house  That which renders Mr Coke's seat superior to perhaps any other in the kingdom all the Norfolk historians seem to agree is its  convenience  and they vary very little in their proofs of this assertion In the first place with respect to the stateapartments from the hall to the saloon on each side a drawingroom through one of them to the state dressingroom and bedchamber this is perfectly complete Through the other drawingroom to the statue gallery which may be called the rendezvous room and connects a number of apartments together in an admirable manner for one octagon opens into the private wing and the other into the strangers on one side and into the diningroom on the other This diningroom is on one side of the hall on the other is Mrs Coke's dressingroom and through that her bedchamber and closets From the recess in the diningroom opens a little door on the staircase which leads immediately to the offices and it should be observed that in the centre of the wings by the centre of the house by the saloon door and behind Mrs Coke's closet are staircases quite unseen which communicate with all the rooms and lead down into the offices We say  down  for the hall is the only room seen on the ground floor you step directly from a coach into it without any quarry of winding steps to wet a lady to the skin before she gets under cover From the hall you rise to the saloon or first floor and there is no attic Thus there are four general apartments which are all distinct from each other with no reciprocal thoroughfares the stateMrs Coke'sthe late Earl'sand the strangers' wing These severally open into what may be called common rooms the hall statuegallery and saloon and all immediately communicate with the dineingroom There may be houses larger and more magnificent but human genius can never contrive any thing more  convenient  To give a proper idea of the plantations park and other objects which environ this  museum  of taste and elegance we shall enter Holkham parish by the road leading from Lynn to Wells where twelve small clumps of trees surrounding the triumphal arch first catch the attention and give warning of an  approach  Turning into a gate on the left the road leads under the TRIUMPHAL ARCH Crossing the Burnham and Walsingham road a narrow plantation on each side a broad vista leads from hence to the obelisk a mile and a half this plantation ought to be much broader for you see the light through many parts of it but it is only a sketch of what the late Earl designed and not meant as complete At the bottom of the hill on which the obelisk stands are the two porters' lodges Rising with the hill you approach the obelisk through a very fine plantation and nothing can be attended with a better effect than the vistas opening at once There are eight To the South part of the house To Holkham church on the top of a steep hill covered with wood a most beautiful object To the town of Wells a parcel of scattered houses appearing in the wood To the triumphal arch Stiff key hills The rest to distant plantations  Vistas are by no means the taste of the present age but such a genius as Lord Leicester the founder of this Mansion might be allowed to deviate from fashion in favour of beauty and propriety Nothing can be more regular than the front of a great house the approach to it ought therefore to partake of this regularity because straight cuts are out of fashion it would be an absurdity to take a winding course to the house door for the sake of catching objects aslant and irregularly such management is to the full in as false a taste as regular cuts where the house is out of the question For instance those from the temple at Holkham which however command exceedingly beautiful objects Wells church Holkham staith The lake in the park which is seen from hence through some spreading trees in a most picturesque manner a planted hill the sea Honclecrondale  The object most striking on the north side of the park is the lake which extends yards in nearly a straight line covering as has been observed about acres including a small island the shore is a bold one covered with wood to a great height and on the top stands the church The stables at the southwest extremity of it are plain neat and commodious The pinery and hothouse are equal to most in England The plantations in general are sketched with it is said unrivalled taste in the number of acres many exceed them but they appear to various points of view infinitely more considerable than they really are At the north entrance into the park they show prodigiously grand you look full upon the house with a very noble back ground of wood the obelisk just above the centre with an extent of plantation on each side Nothing can be more beautiful than that from the church the house appears in the midst of an amphitheatre of wood the plantations rising one above another Another point of view which has been recommended to a traveller's notice is the vale on the east side of the park The north plantation stretches away to the right the south woods to the left and joining in front form an extent of plantation that has a noble effect  The house was begun in by the Earl of Leicester but he dying in it was finished by the Countess Dowager of Leicester in who expended more than l upon it and the additional furniture It is built with curious white brick the centre and wings extending feet in length and in depth  HOLKHAM CHURCH stands on a hill north of the town one mile from the sea and is a noted seamark commanding an extensive prospect on the British ocean it is dedicated to St Withb  rga and has a nave and two ailes with a chancel all covered with lead At the southwest comer of the south aile stands a strong foursquare tower embattled having four bells the lower part serves as a porch to the church the north and south ailes extend on each side of the chancel and serve as buttresses against storms from the sea The east end of both these ailes were chapels and are inclosed The church was thoroughly repaired by the Countess Dowager of Leice  ter in  in point of  contrivance  is  allowed to surpass any other in the kingdom for being so  admirably  adapted to our English way of living  But I confess my friend I go on the wing of impulse to every thing that has HEART in it  that I often feel myself as it were flying from lath and plaster brick and mortar however  skilfully arranged or beautified to soar above them into regions of nature and sensation For which reason though I hold it right and part of my promise to have this account of Holkham set down for you I have a more sincere I would have said a more  congenial  satisfaction in the following wellattested tradition  Influenced by a tender regard to indigent and widowed age in the year the Countess Dowager of Leicester who finished the building of this house erected and endowed and in further benefited an almshouse in this parish for the maintenance of three men and three women to have sixpence a day each one chaldron of coals each annually and to have new cloaths once in two years the objects of her bounty to be elected by the possessor of HolkhamHouse out of some parish in which its estates are situated The building and furnishing the six dwellings and purchasing the rents and estates for the support and maintenance of the whole at her Ladyship's cost  In the spirit of his virtuous ancestor Mr Coke has enlarged I understand and multiplied bounties of this kind an hundred fold  I adopt the idea of Mr Parkin my friend who considered a book which endeavoured  to eternize the memory of truly great and noble benefactors to whom works of consummate excellence and public acts of piety and charity have deservedly given superior distinction ih the age in which they liveda RECORD OF VIRTUE  From FAKENHAM to WALSINGHAM more than one attractive object meets your view Midway are the ruinsI had almost said the repairsof BASHAMABBEY formerly a residence of the Colthorpes "It is worthy the notice of the traveller whatever be his character or profession if an architect the singularity of the edifice with its double display of entrances its ten connected chimniesits massy pillars and its almost impenetrable walls would be attractive if an antiquary it holds out to him in addition to the above the embrickment if so I may write of different armorial bearings even up to the chimney tops if a moralist he may contemplate in the dilapidated state of these edifices the weakness of the utmost strength in the works of men's hands Nor will any one who has but the air of a  person anxious to see more be bounded in his curiosity by the  outer  walls Your immediate correspondent is an evidence of this for while he was viewing from the back of his horse the relicts of this venerable pile one of its present residents Mrs Dennis happening to be passing through the back part of the courtyard with some children sent her servant to inquire if the gentleman wanted any thing Only to take a passing survey of this extraordinary old hall was the answer which being carried to the mistress the servant came a second time to beg the gentleman would alight the steed was conveyed into the stable and not to an empty rackMrs Dennis received your friend as if he had been hers went over the habitable parts of the housepointed to the fretted roofs the massy walls storying them as we past and concluded with a courteous offer of refreshment and declared what I had called a trouble had been a pleasure with so much real urbanity that I dare to ensure you as liberal a welcome as I have myself received and I am certain you will deem this a sufficient  encouragement to stop your horse at the gate of BashamabbeyI feel persuaded at the same time you will suffer this instance of courtesy to go amongst others I have reported to you to dislodge from the minds of your friends an idea which I know prevails on the Continent of a certain roughnot to say insolentthough indeed  brutal  is the foreign wordhaughtiness that literally shuts the gate of good manners in the very face of an unrecommended stranger The real fact is my dear friend both in this and many other countries that strangers shut it against themselves A traveller bringing out with him such an idea throws over his  own  manners a kind of suspicion which is enough not only to realize but to justify it The urbanities of society are intimately connected with each other and many of those most necessary as well in the long and intricate journey of life as in the excursions of pleasure of learning or of curiosity which form no inconsiderable part of it depend in no slight degree on  ourselves  If our advances be frigid and suspicious so will be our reception  and if they be conciliatory they will generally excite a correspondent demeanour and not seldom make courtesy at least a  guest  in the mind where it may not be an  inmate  But the almost expressed word  repairs  in the early part of the above account of BashamAbbey has not been used without a stronger reason that what at first meets the eye Supposing and the supposition is founded any of the original inmates or owners of the mansion to have been amongst the proud old English Barons who held the humble and the poor in tyrannic vassalage or that holy hypocrisy profaned the devotional parts of the building may we not consider the wealthy farmyard which now employs the honest labourer and carries health competence and content to his cottage in these milder timesthe chapel which was once deformed by the imposing despotism of monkish superstition now converted into commodious stabling for the generous steeds and into granaries for private bounty and for public service the enormous rooms of monastic carousal and swinish indolence turned into a comfortable  kitchen where Prudence is the handmaid of Plenty and into the decent keepingroom where children instead of being perverted in their opinions shackled in their faith and warpt in their understanding are nurtured and instructed may we not I say consider all these somewhat in the way of repairs or changes for the better  Parkin in his continuation of Blomfield tells us that Sir W Farmer built here at E B a very large and stately mansionhouse or hall of brick in the reign of the th Henry now very much decayed and ruinous Over the great Gatehouse leading into the Courtyard on the outside are arms of the kings of France and England quarterly supported by a lion and a griffin the arms of Henry and on the right side are those of Farmer Below these are two wild men or giants in two niches one on each side of the gate as janitors armed with clubs Over the door of the porch leading into the hall are the arms of France and England with a griffin and greyhound supporters Henry the VIIth's arms and Farmer impaling And in a low window in the hall is this date in  which year it is probable the house was built  The estate now belongs to Sir Edward Astley of Melton Constable  This seat was built by Sir Jacob Astley about the year and within a few years has been much ornamented and improved particularly the west front but not being a very modern building is still rather in the stile of a neat habitable house than elegant the chapel the grand staircase the ceilings and many of the rooms are highly finished The park contains between six and seven hundred acres is four miles in circumference has lately been judiciously ornamented and the great canal made with uncommon difficulty and much judgment which when properly united with wood will have a fine effect  The country round Melton gradually rises for some miles to the house from the top of which there is an extensive prospect to the east south and west there is a staircase and door to the roof which is of lead and flat  This lordship was granted by the Conqueror to William de Beaufoe bishop of Thetford to be held of him as a lay fee and in his own right with many other being his lord chancellor c and Roger de Lyons held it of the bishop with Anschetel the provost  From this Anschetel the provost descended the family of de Melton who according to the Norman custom assumed that name from their lordship and sometimes wrote themselves de Constable from the office and place that they held under the bishops of Norwich by whom they had been enfeoffed of it  The office of constable related as well to affairs of peace as to military affairs The Conqueror seems first to have appointed this office his grand constable or marshal was stiled Princeps Militiae Domus Regis and was hereditary of whose dignity and authority our statutes and histories afford many proofs and many lordships were held under the king by virtue of it and the same was in this family the office appearing to be hereditary  which as I am informed has claims on your attention  LETTER XIX  WALSINGHAM  August    AND now my dear Baron the country begins to lift itself into superior beauty Nature who had been timid and retired comes suddenly forth and asserts herself The utmost which she could do upon a flat assisted by art has been exhibited at the seat of the Walpoles and in the modest scenery that cheered your way to that august mansion But the smallest cottage in the deep vallies or on the ambitious mountains where the lands rise and fall in solemn and sublime diversity must ever be preferred by a pictorial traveller to the most princely structures and magnificent woods on a level surface  Indeed you are now leaving behind all the  flats in this direction of Norfolk and I must admit the opinion of an observer upon it as to the injustice with which it has been described by many of its hasty historians Most parts except the marsh and fen lands are marked with rising grounds which though they do not ascend with the almost presumptuous daring of skytop'd Switzerland carry your eye over a rich prospect frequently of twenty and sometimes thirty miles  You will perceive a bold variety mark your path and elevate your view from the time you gain the steep ascent that begins its rise from the vale at the foot of Bashamabbey a bold variety of  ground  indeed where nature grows adventurous where she swells the hills more proudly than she is wont in her Norfolk domain and sinks more abrupt and more profoundly into her glens Yet in this particular spot she discovers the nakedness of her land in  one  respect more than in some of the most undecorated uncheary and even in the wildest parts of her British possessions  You will be attracted for a moment by the  summits unobstructedly rising before you you will be refreshed by verdure that invites the foot and invigorates the eyebut alas where is now the wood the thicket the hedgerow where are even the shrubs Oh beauteous Nature prodigal as thou art of all these in thy spring thy summer thy autumnal charms why hast thou withdrawn them from WALSINGHAM  The question will be answered in no common way and I must on this occasion be the medium of Nature's reply You will hear on the road my friend and indeed from the utmost verge of the country were you even  there  to begin your inquiries of a strange distraught being who turns night into day day into nightwho goes to bed when all the rational part of the world get up and who rises when they retire to restYou will be told that in the oeconomy of his houshold he is no way absurdly profuse yet that he has suffered and therefore encouraged for twice ten years a pack of vagabonds in his parish to cut down burn and sell the timber which were of his  father's and his own planting that he has allowed this felonious enormity to grow from bad to worsefrom breaking up hedges and lopping branches to the exterminating whole nurseries and plantations of no less value than ornament to his estate and indeed to the picturesque beauty of the countrythat when any of these midnight robberswho ought at least to incur the penalty of a law in our country called the Black Actcome in view of our midnight wandererfor at the noon of night you will be told commence his perambulationshe only says mildly "take care how you get down that tree or you may hurt yourself"  In addition to all this you will hear it asserted and very truly that by these depredations he has sustained a loss of  twenty thousand  pounds at  least  thatso daring have at length become the offendersstrings of boys and girls have been seen in the broad eye of day to bend under the burthen of nurseling plants of as tender an age and smaller than themselveswhile the parents of these children  setting the odious example have been laden with whole trees  All this you will  inevitably  hear Baron and you will doubtless conclude either that the proprietor is in effect out of his mind or that the indignant peasantry having long groaned under his tyranny or famished under his avarice had formed themselves into a conspiracy against the despotism of the tyrant and collected a phalanx so powerful as to make the loss even of the miser's gold secondary to his dread of proceeding against the bandittiYou will perhaps conclude that some apprehension of personal outrage might be added to such an attack on property and that a certain consciousness of deserving it is the chief motive of thus inverting the order of nature by venturing forth only when timid or guilty things suppose themselves comparatively safe and even then "treading as if in fear they trod"  The vegetable desolation which you will see around you on entering the domain of this singular person who is still living might  possibly under the impression of these first appearances lead you to turn back that you may escape the very air which such a wretch is permitted to breathe or you might be tempted to pass rapidly through his village were you not to learnwhich you will from every Walsingham villagerthat this grinder of the poor this tyrant of the richthisbut you shall judge of him by characteristical anecdotes for the truth of whichsingular as they must appear to every foreignerstrange even as they are to us in this  country of character  I refer you not only to every inhabitant of Walsingham but almost to every person in this part of Norfolk  In my first walk of observation and inquiry the following conversation passed between your correspondent and Mr Jacobs the landlord of a public house immediately fronting the garden walls of the above gentleman  A handsome seat my friend this and if I am to believe report inhabited by a very extraordinary person  "Extraordinarily  good Sirfor that matter too good"  That  I should conceive to be more singular still How is he too good  "Why because he has made almost every chick and child of the parish good for nothing And they use him just as if he was as bad as themselves though he would not hurt a fly Nay for that matter I can tell you what happened between him and a fly in his own house And if you'll step with me as far as those iron gates I'll shew you the very room where it fell out"  We walked together to the place he mentioneda stately railing according to the ancient fashion opening on a spacious lawn at the end of which stands the abbey whose architecture as well as the broad moat that half encircles it resembles such of the country houses of England and the chateaus of Germany as were erected about the beginning of the present or towards the close of the last century On each side of the piece of water is a kind of grove equidistant and somewhat formal but in good keeping with the fashion of the house for in those days as I think I have before mentioned  to you the vegetable scenery of this country as well as its buildings and indeed its inhabitants consulted rather the grandeurs than the graces an evidence of false taste finely ridiculed by one of our favourite poets  Grove nods at grove each ally has its brother  And half the platform just reflects the other  I really do not believe there are a dozen trees on the one side of this grovelet more or less than the other and certainly not half the number of inches either in the diameter or circumference of the grassplots and foliage of the same  kind  stand so exactly parallel that a quartermaster might shew them to his raw recruits as an example of soldierlike symmetry not a branch nor arm or scarcely a leaf but has its companion and assisted by the equal motion of the breeze they seem to exchange the salute military  But the space between the water and the wood on either side was at the time I surveyed them filled with objects by no means formal an innumerable quantity of poultry of all kinds were spreading themselves over the lawn or  swimming in the moat and I could not but express my surprize that the inhabitants of the court yard should be suffered to take their pastime in the garden  "I suppose Sir" says Jacobs "you are wondering to see so many ducks geese chickens cocks hens c in the 'Squire's garden but if you had been here before sunrise or if you should come later in the evening there would be something worth looking at for then the 'Squire gets them all about him by hundreds He is not up yet for I suppose it is not above five in the afternoon in a couple of hours though he will begin to  think  about rising but if he does not come down stairs till ten or twelve at night which is often the case not a fowl of them will roost till they see him The moment he leaves his roomthat is it with the closed shuttershe opens that front door and gives his poultry their supper though he does not get even his breakfast till midnight and sometimes two or three in the morning Oh 'twould do your heart good to see the pigeons come from that dovehouse  and light upon his hat shoulders hands and arms and the other creatures that are now straying about run to him fit to break their necks the pullets and chickens fly up to perch on him while they peck out of his hand or his basket Then his pigs his dogs and other animals in the yard get  their  turn for he goes out at that gate on the right and gives them their breakfast and all this in Winter and Summer as sure as the day and night goes and comes"  "But you promised me the story of the fly Mr Jacobs"  "And I will be as good as my word Sir The affair fell out in that parlour to the left when with some other townsman we were dining with the 'Squire who has no more pride than one of his chickens and as you shall hear presently not more gall than his pigeons As we were standing just before dinner came in at that very window we heard a humming over our heads and looking up saw a fly in a cobwebtrap the spider just at the end of his line balancing away just like one of the tumbling  men I have seen at our Walsingham Wake He looked just like a little black ball of poison and in another minute would have darted away and got the poor fly in his clutches if the 'Squire had not frightened him away with his white handkerchiefbut only the air of it as he waved it about in this fashionfor though he made the webecod and the weaver too shake and shiver as if they were both in an ague fit he did not break a single thread of the fellow's work however it got the fly out of her hobble for down she dropt at the very first whisk upon the window seat flat on her back and almost stunned Almost all this time the dinner was standing by itself on the table and there it might have stood for the 'Squire till now if he had not settled the affairand how do you think he managed itas sure as you are alive he took her up as soft as if she was his kin then let her lay in his handkerchief as if she was on a fine white muslin bed with nice cotton sheets We then went to tablehe used in those days to dine in Summer even before sunsetsometimes so soon as three or four  o'clockand I think I never saw the 'Squire so merryfor he is as nice a man and as full of cleverness as any in the hundredbut in the midst of the fun up he got and ran to the window but was back in an instant with the handkerchief in his hand 'as the bird is flown' said he 'I think I may venture to take the nest' 'Squire said I the fly may thank heaven you were at the window "I suppose he answered 'every thing that has life wishes to live as long as it can friend Jacobs and as so many animals die that we may live it is the least we can do to save one or two when we can'  "And are there any amongst youany who can do an injury or even an injustice to this restorer of the fallen fly No doubt his benevolent disposition ascends from animals to man from the poor reptile you have just mentioned from the poor reptile you have just mentioned as its object to such of his fellowcreatures as are in distress" questioned the Gleaner  "Distress Sir" answered Jacobs "why he never could bear to hear of it or to see it and as I told you did not hurt that damn'd spider though for my part I wish'd his poisonbag  taken from his little pod belly and cram'd down his own ugly throatI love an honest fellow but down with a rogue wherever you meet him say I'Tis a  sort  of years ago to be sure since we  largess'd  A harvest term in Norfolk  for it was at harvesttide in that parlour else I should not wonder if the rascal was seesawing upon his line or mending his nets or squating in his corner as sly as a bailiff just when I left him at this minute But I dare say some imps as black as young devils and as wicked are there or thereabouts for neither rogue nor honest personage will the 'Squire harm not he and that Sir makes me say he is too good O it would make your bloodfreeze or else boil but to  think  how he has been used for it"  "So I have heard You allude to the devastations committed in his woods and hedges the theft and plunder of his timber"  "Woods and hedges that is bad enough to be sure for except the small firgrove at the  head of yon highland and that stands only because it is in the hands of a tenant who has a long lease of his farm there's not a tree that is bigger than a maypole and but very few of  them  on the whole estate Nay the people have begun upon this wilderness which I remember as thick and green again as you now see it for that matter they go into the abbey back yard and carry away just what they like for the devil a dog will he keepas I would to snap at their legs or jump at their throats and if a servant catches them in the fact and speaks to them their only answer is 'if the 'Squire comes to tell us himself that we should not do as we like why we will leave off'  "And has this reply ever been reported to the 'Squire"  "A hundred times Sir but what of that He'll not come out if they were to tell him so a  thousand  times a hundred Pray Sir at what inn are you"  "The King'shead I think kept by a widowwoman"  "Close to the abbey yard a good house  and a good woman and just lost a good husband"  "I perceive she is in mourning"  "When you get back do but step into the 'Squire's back yard three or four doors on the right from the widow's and you will have cause to mourn as you shall hear The yard is a kind of grove I remember it  sweetsome  to behold it has a good deal of shade yet but a  sort  more trees lie dead on the ground than are to be seen alive in it ay and some of the finest timber in England But you could never guess how they got into the 'Squire's backyard unless I were to tell you Why Sir they were all brought there at different times either by the 'Squire's own tenants of servants when they were returning from plough or passing in a waggon or cart  "For what purpose Mr Jacobs"  "To save them from being carried off and sold by the vagabonds in Little and Great Walsingham and in short all round the country after they had hewn and hacked them down I myself Sir have help'd to draw  some of them to the abbey with my own  donky  and have taken some of the hatchets and axes out of the thieves' hands and carried them myself to the 'Squire"  "And what said he upon that evidence"  "Said he" answered Jacobs half grinding his teeth"why he said to me just what he has often said to every servant in the abbey and indeed to almost every honest man in the parishthere are some honest fellows in spite of him'Not right  Mr  Jacobs'for he  musters  every bodythe civilest gentleman you ever saw'Not right Mr Jacobs that the people should use their axes and hatchets to cut down my timber but very wrong Mr Jacobs that you should steal them It is but commiting the same fault a different way yet one bad thing does not excuse another so pray Mr Jacobs make all the haste you can to return what you have stolen' I see Sir you look as if you did not believe me and how the devil should youI do not think there have ever been such doings as there have at WALSINGHAM since the beginning of the world at least  since the planting of the first tree in Adam's garden but the thing is as true as that those ducks are swimming in the moat"  There are so many circumstances whereon to found disbelief in the account of this very amiable but singular man that although I can with the most scrupulous veracity declare with Mr SOUTHEY in his entertaining interesting and elegant "Letters in Spain and Portugal" that "I have never in the slightest instance enlivened the narrative by deviating from plain truth" I feel it necessary to repeat now my correspondence is preparing for the public that I have represented things as they  are to be seen and heard  by any man in England who chooses to make inquiry  But what I have now told you is nothing to the shocking tricks played on his cattle horses and corn I suppose you would think I  must  be fibbing were I to inform you that whoever has a mind to it goes into his stable saddles or harnesses a horse and rides or ploughs with him bringing him home at night or keeps him a week or a fortnight together without so much as a question being asked by the 'Squire and what is worse they not only steal the wheat barley and other grain from the field when it is sheaved to save themselves tho  trouble of cutting it but they are wicked enough to cut off the cornears by whole acres before they are half ripe"  "Good GOD what wantonness" exclaimed I "why this is worse than all the rest"  "Not the worst neither Sir" rejoined Jacobs "there is a tenant of his an innholder and I hope you will not think I am going to tell a lie of him because he is a brother publican but he has not paid rent these nine or ten years and the 'Squire lets him go on just the same as I do who am as sure as quarterday but what will you say when I tell you that the 'Squire sent his servant to say he might lessen the debt by supplying the abbey family with beer but for all that the second time it was sent in a bill went with a letter "to hope the 'Squire would not be offended but times were so hard he could not afford to trust unless one barrel was paid for when another should be brought"  "Can that be possible"  "Ay and worse yet for you may see little  boys and girls steal the pease from the very troughs when they cannot carry off the pigs for which the 'Squire has left off hogfatting for fear of their being starved to death and is now obliged to buy his own bacon though to be sure there are a few old swine in the yard because the 'Squire says they may as well stay where they are till they're called for he has always something droll and merry to say upon it let people do what they will as you must needs think when you hear another of his answers about cutting down his trees"The estate was barren friend when I came to it and is likely to be barren again"  During the latter part of this discourse Mrs Jacobs came from the house to tell her husband he was wanted and we soon parted I returned to the inn under sensation and impression scarce to be described still wishing to discredit at least that part of the evidence which was brought against the common gratitude of the neighbourhood but whatever I heard or saw afterwardsand from all ranks of people in the progress of several days' sojourn  at Walsingham and in various walks and rides of observationnot only confirmed the details which Jacobs had given but added many aggravating circumstances In particular the anecdote of a tenant who having omitted to pay any thing for the rent of a considerable farm came at last to the abbey with a complaint to the 'Squire that so far from thinking he could settle arrears he must give up his farm his family being so large he could not live on it himself "Poor Tom" said the 'Squire "that is hard indeed then we must go some  other  way to work" "I do not know how that can be Sir" said the farmer "seeing that I have neither horses carts cows nor sheephaving sold them allthere's nothing but the land left and that you may have backand here and there mayhap a halfstarved hen or turkey and they may go with it" "My poor poor Tom worse and worse" quoth the Squire "nevertheless go home to your family and we will see what can be done if  you  have no carts or horses  I  have and I believe the best way to make you pay me is now to help you to do it"  With these assurances he was prevailed upon to continue in the farm and from that time to that day twelvemonth his landlord shared with him the use not only of the promised articles as to cattle and stock but every instrument of husbandryhis own servant lent to plough to sow and to reap previously buying for him the very seed to put in the ground and in short  farmed for the farmer  An expression alas for human nature but too literal It is lamentably true that he was not farming for himself for I find poor Tom succeeded as ill as before at least the profits of this eleemosynary labour much oftener found its way into the pocket of my hostess at the King'shead and other alehouses in the neighbourhood than into that of the 'Squire at the Abbey  In course of various conversations however I found that Mr ****** had once been moved gently to remonstrate against axe and hatchetmen and that was when a banditti of them were about to cut down a favourite and indeed famous chesnuttree then it was he ventured to signifybut still by a medium  "that he could wish they would desist" In answer to which they repeated what they had often said before "if the 'Squire comes and says so to us himself we will" The servant carried the answer the master said nothing more and the tree was cut down  My mind had been filling as well with the strange things I had heard from Jacobs as with the confirming report of others I had encountered on the way and I literally "went forth into the fields at eventide to meditate" But what did those fields present as I wandered about them without any settled direction I followed a ruthless guideeven the exterminating axe Unexpectedly the Sun broke out intensely hot and I absolutely panted for the shade I observed some cattle in the same pursuit A clump of trees would have been a real comfort to man and beast Even the patient cows with their tails twisted mouths open and at their full unwieldy run were hunting over the mead for a green covert while a bull labouring with the heat and tortured by the flies was tearing up the earth for what none of us could find  I bent my way again towards Walsingham and took refuge in the first cottage I found at the outskirts of the village The peasants were at their tea the rosy children equally defying the powers of sun or shade were laden with their brownbread suppera huge healthlooking slice Perhaps I envied I certainly blessed both them and their meal I blessed their hut and as usual was soon a part of the humble houshold The parents of the family ratified every former account respecting the desolation of the woods and the indifference of the proprietor as to what became of them The mother of the family allowed "it was very strange the 'Squire should suffer such doings" and the father loudly reprobated the wickedness of those "who could take advantage of such an easy gentleman's temper" I must remark nevertheless I have since heard that both mother and father and also a married son at a place called Snoring were three of the most active and determined loppers and choppers the poor woodlands had to complain of  On leaving the cot I fell into some profound ruminations respecting the vegetable ruins I had been surveying The very sight of them was to me a serious affliction You know Baron how much I luxuriate in verdure and that I may be said without any strain on the metaphor to  see feelingly  the charms of nature that my heart rejoices to observe a flourishing plantation with as sincere and perhaps a more pure delight than its possessor Knowing this you will judge of what I experienced from a view of a whole dismantled estate which indeed was left little more than the green earth  To the eye of fancy the very genius of the woods seemed to be seated on a trunk of one of the many THOUSAND the word is used in a  literal  sense many THOUSAND majestic trees which were wont to grace and enrich the domain The licensed yet merciless robbers have scarcely left a shade for the diminutive wren much less a shelter for the wayfarer even from a passing shower They have not only hewn down and cast into the fire whole thriving purseries of oak and fir planted by Mr ***+******'s  own hand and trees of nobler growth but have carried their felonious depredations even to the hedgerows which they have stripped of every tree that answered to a poor man even the  trouble  of cutting down In a word the whole estate a circuit of several miles exhibits in a natural sense a mutilated and mangled prospect once pleasing and profitable and in a mord sense a yet more melancholy view of the depravity the ingratitude and the wantonness of men when they have not the fear of the iron hand of the law before their eyes  I returned to my inn with the true step of profound reflectiona step which our poets treading in the track of each other have justly called "solemn and slow" A character altogether new in an old world and even in a part of it abounding with original beings of almost every possible kind had displayed itself to my view I knew my mind to be free from the deeprooted incredulity of those stayathome deciders of what is seen abroad and who think every thing must be false that  seems  so particularly  if it is incomprehensible to them and I had so often attested the wonderful diversity of nature in all her operationsand perhaps more than any other in the mind of manthat I could not easily be staggered in my faith But I had unexpectedly met in an obscure nook of the island a variety of circumstances which I feel I should  myself  have doubted had they been given to me on the credit of any single reporter however respectable Here was at once a complete indifference not to say triumph over what every other being in civilized society when not absorbed in grief has always considered as sacred  the value or the beauty of their property  I had before heard of men who had prosecuted a poor man to the utmost rigour of our law for breaking a hedge or cutting down a twig but it had never come within my knowledge or belief that a gentleman in the possession of a wellwooded domain and of sound understanding could allow almost every tree it had once to boast to be deliberately cut down and carried away and  that  without so much as making an inquiry after the  offenders or entering into any remonstrance as to their past or present or future depredations  Yet I felt an earnest desire to become personally acquainted with so extraordinary a man and from repeated assurances collected in the course of the following day respecting the politeness and urbanity with which he received strangers I wrote to entreat the favour of an interview and received an answer about eleven o'clock the same evening by his servant who said his master was going to get up and would be glad to receive me at twelve  I cannot describe to you the unusual sensation on my entering his abbey It was about a quarter past twelve o'clockFrom the historians of the place and from the country reporters I seemed to be familiar with him the poor fly and the story of farmer Tom were still in my heart yet it beat faster and somewhat more anxiously than usual as I found myself in his room of receiving companyI stood amidst a groupe of old family pictures Wines of different sorts were on the table and two glasses and chairs set ready  Wax candles were lighted by a servant who informed me "the  'Squire  would be down stairs presentlyin the mean time Sir" said he "there are books and maps and the last newspaper to amuse you" I turned over some of these rather mechanically than with consciousness for the palpitation continued and assisted by the lateness of the hour the long abbey yard I had passed the sight of the rescued timber Jacobs spoke of and which a lantern I was obliged to use shewed me and the antique though hospitable air of every thing around produced a sort of gothic sensation and might have told extremely well in one of the magical romances of the day Had I been keeping an assignation with one of the very ghosts with which a novelist might haunt this abbey I could not have been more awfully situated and to give a finish to my feelings the bearded ancestors of the family seemed to look frowningly at me from their canvas  I believe we all make fancy drawings of the persons we have long admired wondered at or wished to see especially when any singular  qualities associate with our ideas of them and as for the most part we give features and figures correspondent to what we have heard or read of their manners or minds we are probably in general more correct than faulty in these portraitures of the imagination My anticipated lineaments and dimensions of this gentleman however formed a complete exception to the rule for they failed in every particular I had fashioned him muscular and corpulent with a projected brow and somewhat of a misanthropic cast of countenance attributing his seclusion and supineness partly to having unfitted himself for exercise and his indifference to the public injuries he had sustained to a secret resentment against those who had wronged him although he forbore to complain or to punish  The reverse of this picture was soon made manifest for the original appeared even while I was finishing his copy Mr ****** is between seventy and eighty years of age yet perfectly upright small but elegantly formed and of the most engaging countenance His manners are prepossessing his address easy  and he has nothing that bespeaks the old school but his dress which gave me back the exact image of the English gentleman of the last age He was habited in a fawncoloured suit of cloaths edged with gold which however from the effect of time had taken the cast of silver a binding of the same ornamented his knees a deep chitterlin of rich lace somewhat yellowed by age graced his bosom and the deep slash sleeves and highwrought richly embossed button of good old days decorated the sleeves of his coat His shoes were curved at the toe and their buckles were such as are now worn by our old gentlemen  upon the stage  and indeed by some young gentlemen at present  off  the stage for the fashion of times past are in this respect come round again His conversation is animated his remarks judicious his reading extensive and his acquaintance with modern as well as ancient literature by no means inconsiderable Over the whole of his communications presides a certain hospitable and yet unassuming courtesy that captivates while it instructs Soon after one in the morning the  tea equipage was brought which served for  his  breakfast and the beverage I  should  have taken about seven the preceding evening had I not reserved myself for all that might happen on an occasion which promised what it performed something very extraordinary The subjects we discussed were various We warmed as we proceeded Social topics are interesting I caught from my host the wisdom of the past and endeavoured to remunerate him by describing scenes of the present the middle and the closing parts of the century were thus divided between us In this kindling progress I soon forgot that I had passed the hour at which I usually had been asleep and that Mr ****** had but lately risen  At length preparations were made for supper and while the table was serving he took upon himself the trouble to shew me every part of the abbey giving me as we passed along its ancient history in the best and clearest language and pointing out to me the most correct sources of farther information respecting other antiquities of Walsingham  The servant announced the repast It was his master's dinner and of course my supper The clock struck the fourth hour of the morning soon after we were seated There was a little of every thing and that little of the best and it may be truly said "he gaily pressed and smiled" Thankless and sullen must have been the guest that would not have been cheered It was not till after the Sun had put our candles to the blush and quenched their miserable morsels of artificial light in his living beams that I could prevail upon myself to bid him good morning or let me proudly say that he would suffer me to say farewell  On the following night I repeated my visit and renewed my pleasure A third and a fourth invitation succeeded and I could not but accept them In these I had opportunity to see him in every point of view that bespoke the scholar and the gentleman But not a sentence nor a circumstance at any time came forth that denoted the wonderful thingsthe almost phaenomenathat were reported of him withoutdoors I was more than once tempted to lead  the subject that way but not perceiving him disposed to follow it would have been rudeness to persist and his silence struck me as a new trait in a new character  LETTER XX  WALSINGHAM  Sept    YET the force of the facts was by no means diminished by his silence every hour of my sojourn here has increased their energy Persons of every character had something to add to the strength of former accounts When however I heard that the amiable man under consideration had paid five hundred pounds as the forfeit of refusal to act as sheriff for the county rather than engage in a situation that might make him an eyewitness if not an accessary in the punishment of crimes even to death and that while he was in commission of the peace as a magistrate many instances are on record wherein there has been the most severe conflict betwixt his sense  of justice and his feeling of compassion when moreover I had myself watched his conduct to the domestic animals that surrounded him and if you will permit me so to express myself observed  their  conduct to him when I saw every living thing under his protection approach towards instead of receding from himwhile I was myself unseen and unsuspectedand when I heard his servants speak of him with uniform gratitude and respect and the peasants of the country declare like his tenant Jacobs that he was "too good"with very few exceptions to this reportand those bearing the marks of malignity and disappointment rather than of truthwhen I considered all this I no longer laboured to discover that the motive for his thus seeming to disregard what men in general are so tenacious of must originate in a principle of virtue even while it sanctions a vice The cause is honourable to his nature though the effect is injurious to society I scarcely know how to express myself dear Baron the circumstance is new and methinks there should be a new form of words or at  least a better arranger of old ones than your correspondent to express it without incurring the censure of a paradox It is notwithstanding clear to my mind however I may have embarrassed the language that his nature can endure neither to be principal nor abettor in giving pain or sufferance even to those whom his good sense must Inform him abundantly deserve it and that were he once to appear in the character of a prosecutor and pursue a detected culprit to the extremity of the law his own private misery would far exceed his sense of the service he would thereby do to the public  I by no means presume to offer this as a general justification of such kind of lenity I am aware it would confuse and disorder the community beyond all reparation I only suggest it in defence of a mind constructed with peculiar softness and from a wish to represent him to a number of his friends who I know love and honour him yet who seem to want a vindicationan explanationof the only part of a character that stands in need of it  Having now finished my sketch of the most prominent object in Walsinghamand one which would certainly be considered as deserving to stand very forward on the canvas in any part of the worldI can conscientiously pass on to other matters deserving your attention  In a former letter you remember I promised you more particulars of our august dame of WALSINGHAM of whom wishing to pay her all possible homage I have been sedulous to collect whatever has been said to her honour that merits notice though not the hundredth tythe of the marvellous circumstances which tradition has told For in our days of darkness and superstition when priests and monks ruled not only the consciences but the purses of the English Laity "they who had not made a pilgrimage and an offering at the shrine of the blessed Virgin of this place were looked upon as impious and irreligious"  Now for it then  So great was the fame of this idol or image of the Lady of Walsingham that foreigners of all nations came on a pilgrimage to her  insomuch that the number of her devotees and worshippers seemed to equal those of the Lady of Loretto in Italy and what my friend will deem much better the town of Little Walsingham owed its chief support and maintenance to the devotional offerings which were paid to this great personage Of the royal visitors our third Henry appears to have done homage to her March in the th year of his reign his precept enjoining all who held in  capite  to meet him on the octaves of Easter at Winchester on an expedition into Gascoign being dated here as above and what expedition could have the hope to prosper unless her Ladyship was disposed to assist the cause  Next in the princely procession was the first EDWARD who was here on January the th in his th year as appeared by the date of a patent for the repair of Londonbridge and again in his th year on the Purification of the Virgin and his successor was also here October the th in his th year  In the th of Edward II John de Montfort duke of Bretagne in France came and  had the king's  liberate  to the treasurer and chamberlains of the Exchequer to deliver £ for the expences of his journey to Walsingham and back to London and in the said year the duke of Anjou had licence to visit the shrine of St Thomas à Becket of Canterbury  David Bruce king of Scotland had in the th year of the said king a protection to come to Walsingham with thirty horse and his queen Margaret made a vow to visit also St Thomas of Canterbury  Moreover ISABEL countess of Warwick in bequeathed her tablet with the image of our Lady to the church of Walsingham also to the Lady there her gown of alyz cloth of gold with wide sleeves and a tabernacle of silver like in the timbre to that of our Lady of Caversham  HENRY the VII mentions in his will that he had ordered an image of silver and gilt to be made and offered up and set before the Lady of Walsingham and also a like image for St Thomas of Canterbury  The notorious HARRY the VIII in his d  year soon after Christmas rode here and in the said year May as appears in a MS of payments by the keeper of the privy seal s d were then paid to Mrs Garneys for the king's offering to her and signed by the king's hand at Walsingham  Queen CATHERINE his wife during the king's absence in France in his th year came and returned thanks to the Lady for the great victory over the Scots at Floddonfield September  Nay Spelman says that when he was a youth it was commonly reported that Henry the VIII walked barefoot from the town of Basham to the chapel of the Lady and there presented her with a necklace of very great value "with a view perhaps" says Spelman "to moderate the resentment of the Virgin when he thought fit" as he did soon after "to banish her from her monastery and to pull it down" for  he was so sensible of her wonderful goodness how ready she was to remember small favours  and godlike to forget great injuries that on his deathbed he bequeathed  his soul to  her  but whether his executors disposed of it strictly according to his will and testament is not a point altogether certain because I believe they fulfilled it in no other article You are sufficiently conversant with the history of that Monarch to set a due value on the Royal legacy at any rate you will allow it wanted a little  purification  and was therefore very properly bequeathed to a Saint  Queen CATHERINE in  her  will desires that five hundred masses should be said for  her  soul and that a person should make a pilgrimage to our Lady at Walsingham and distribute two hundred nobles in charity upon the road The amiable though outraged mind of Catherine gives every hope that without any such homage to the image her charitable spirit would be acceptable and ascend to the veritable GOD to whose mercy we may trust even the illassorted soul of her lord the king more safely than to a myriad of idols  So superstitious so weak and credulous were the commonalty that they believedas they were then imposed upon and taughtthe Galaxy  or what is called in the sky the MilkyWay was appointed by Providence to point out the particular place and residence of  this  Virgin beyond all other places and was thereupon generally in that age called WalsinghamWAY and I have heard old people in this county so distinguish it  Among the innumerable miracles that were ascribed to her accept what followsOn the north side at which you enter the close of the priory was a very low and narrow wickerdoor through which it was difficult for any one to pass on foot being as an old MS says "Not past an elne hye and three guarters in bredth" And a certain Norfolk knight Sir Ralph Boutetourt armed capapee and on horseback being pursued by a cruel enemy and in the utmost danger of being taken made full speed for this gate and invoking the Lady for hi  deliverance he immediately found himself and his horse within the close and sanctuary of the priory in a safe asylum and so  "fooled his enemy"  This is said to have happened in the year A memorial of it was engraven  on a plate of copper with the effigies of the knight his horse c nailed on the gate of the priory and was read by Erasmus who observes that there was preserved one joint of a finger of St Peter as large as that of the Colossus at Rhodes  But alas this so famous image of the Lady was in the th  of Henry the VIII  brought by the Lord High ChamberlainCromwell to Chelsea by London and there publicly burnt No doubt she was first beheaded Henry you remember was quite in the habit of decapitating his idolsbut all for conscience' sake as no doubt was the motive of this noble act You observe that in the second year of his reign he went  barefoot  from Basham to Walsingham with an offering of the rich necklace then threw the sacred image into the fire I cannot find any account of what became of the necklace The Lord High Chamberlain of the day Thomas Cromwell carried the image from this town to Chelsea a village in the neighbourhood of London and saw it by the royal order committed to the flames and if you choose  you may believe that the pious Monarch deeming the necklace polluted by the wearer disdained to receive it back so directed that it should be consumed with the image  The shrine of the Virgin is splendidly described by Erasmus who had been on the spot The church is beautiful but the Virgin dwells not in it out of veneration and respect that honour is granted to her son She has however so contrived as to be on the right hand of her son but neither in  that  doth she live the building being not yet finished says Erasmus In this church there is a small chapel of wood into which the pilgrims were admitted on each side at a narrow door there was but little or no light in it but what proceeded from wax tapers yielding a most pleasant and odoriferous smell but "if you look in you will say it is a seat of the Gods so bright and shining it is all over with jewels gold and silver" Blomfield observes that a Canon resident always attended at the altar to receive and  take care of  the offerings The Lady was patroness both of the abbey and priory  It appears likewise that the chief Prior had the secondbest of every animal in the parish and if there was but onewhy he had that  I am just come from inspecting the remains of the building of the abbey They consist of a large portal or gatehouse at the west entrance the east window of the chapel is a richly ornamented arch upwards of sixty feet high built in the reign of Henry the VII the old one being pulled down the refectory or eatinghouse entire seventyeight feet long and twentyseven broad the walls twentysix feet and a half highthe measures taken within side There are a good west window and stone pulpit in it the whole building is in good preservation twelve columns with gothic arches and part of the old cloisters evidently built before the last chapel  Buck in a plate published in and dedicated to the present proprietor has taken away the roof in order to make it appear in the print more picturesque  The length of the cloister which was square was fiftyfour paces The length of  the chapterhouse twenty paces the breadth ten the old abbey wall was near a mile in circuit and is yet entire in many parts also a stone bath with steps descending into it and two uncovered wells called "the wishing wells" Of the virtue of the last great things are said as indeed might be well expected when the devotees to the Lady of Walsingham were taught to believe that whomsoever was permitted to drink of these waters might obtain their wishes  "sans fee"  Many of the wonders of these miraculous wells might be recorded for you but the comments of the Sage who told them to me Mr ******'s old Gardeneris I hope a curiosity in store for you Though half deaf and not a little lame he has good promise of yet longer existence and each domestic of Walsingham abbey being a tenant  at will  and I dare anticipate will if survivor have more even than a master's lifeinterest in the estate you will therefore probably see as curious a Gardener of as curious a garden as you can ever expect to meet in this world of curiosities  and if on your arrival the poor fellow should no longer be a moveable you will find him a fixture In the meantime I will not withhold from you a little discourse that passed between us at the wells "If you are for a wish Sir now is your time and they  do  say that you may have just what you will though for my part I have been wishing here these thirty years and have not got my wish yet"  "That is hard indeed Mr Gardener seeing that you live at the fountainhead"  "Very good for bad eyes I believe master but not much in them to help us out of bad luck though a pair of lasses who came awishing here last Summer and dipt their pretty faces into them were here again in the beginning of this season and told me that both had got what they wanted and whether the wellwater had any thing to do with it or not so as they had their wishes you know Sir it was the same thing 'specially as they gave me a shilling a piece because they said funnily enough methought I had help'd them to their wants and wishes"  "Still you could not succeed for yourself my poor fellow But that is not singular The greatest prophets fortunetellers and magicians who have predicted such mighty matters for others can seldom do more than keep themselves from starving Even a witch  "A witch" says the late ingenious Mr Grose in his short account of popular superstitions "is almost universally a poor decrepit superannuated woman yet we do not find that in consequence of her wicked compact she enjoys much of the good things of this world but still continues in abject penury" This however is a subject I shall resume when I take you into the  witching  parts of England  you must have heard hardly ever got enough to buy her a new broomstick after she had worn out the old one to the stumps"  "But perhaps you do not believe in the power of witches any more than you do in your wishing wells"  "Under favour Sir I do not"  "Is it fair to inquire into any of your own wishes Mr Gardener"  "Why sometimes I wish Sir that I could  get the buzzing out of this ear that I might not be so deaf and I grow worse every year then again I have wished I could bring this hip about and yet I am lamer than ever and lastly which is worse than all I have wished a hundred times the 'Squire would let this yard and wilderness be kept in the trim it used to be and that he would get somebody to trim the thieves that rob him of all they can lay hold of but no such good luck Why as sure as you are alive Sir they come now into the yard and garden in broad day knowing master is safe in bed and carry off what comes to hand without taking any more notice of me than if I was a dead thing and a dead thing I don't doubt but they would soon make of me if I was to say much to themA pure good man a right good masterand won't harm a worm Pity an't it Sir he should let them go on thus Well it's no use to talk to him he's fast asleep I suppose now and GOD bless himits some comfort though there is little or nothing left for the rogues to take without they begin upon the garden trees here which  I dare say they will when they have cleared the abbeyyard of the fell'd and standing timber now in it  That I might not seem to throw myself out of the way of fortune I took a draught of the water out of the wishing tumbler which the good gardener kept in a little nook of the wall and  wish'd  that master and servant might have health and happiness till I saw them again  The town of WALSINGHAM has a good market stands on the banks of a nameless river which runs into the sea below STIFKEY at about six or seven miles' distance and one of its most delightful rides is to the lastnamed village This recommendation goes strengthened to you by various travellers particularly Arthur Young who says what I found delightfully true "that the ride from WARHAM by STIFKEY is through a most picturesque country the road runs on the brow of the hill looking down on STIFKEY vale The vale which is composed of meadows of the finest verdure winds in a very beautiful manner from out of a thicket of woody  inclosures and retires behind a projecting hill an humble stream glides through it and adds a cheerfulness which water can so well confer" The hills ascend boldly before you and though they are bare of wood that defect is compensated by the thick inclosures in which the village is scattered forming with its church in a dip of the hill and that of Blakeney above it in a prouder situation a complete picture  The hall or manorhouse now occupied at present by Mrs Buck the tenant of the farm is the stately ruin of a large and noble structure built by Sir Nicholas Bacon in the reign of queen Elizabeth whose arms and date are on the gateway The house is situated in the bottom of a deep and gloomy vale surrounded with the high and steep hills just mentioned a languid stream runs close by its south front environed with a few tall trees which add not a little to the pensive appearance of the whole scene  The west front with two embrasured towers is more uniform than most houses of the same age The gateway introduced you to a spacious  area of which the main building formed the west and north and the gardens and offices with high walls the east side  The church dedicated to St John the Baptist stands on the higher ground a little north of the hall as does the parsonage a neat and commodious dwelling now occupied by the rector The present Marquis Townshend resided here some time after his return from Ireland where as has been already noted he had presided as Lord Lieutenant with the greatest reputation and dignity for many years  The first three miles from WALSINGHAM on the way to HOLT continue to shew the progress of the hatchet and the boundaries of the estate of Mr ****** are marked so accurately by that fell conveyancer that you take measure of them for a full league on both sides the road whereon you are left with scarce the shelter of a hedge much less of a tree the truth of which I might justly say a forest of stumps evince You know your return to foliage the exact point at which the spoilers have been constrained to  check their course The traveller and Nature herself are relieved by the change  I stop in a little roadside glen of Oaks on the left about a mile from the first village belonging to Sir George Chad to enjoy the alteration I have given the rein to my horse who in the midst of the shaded grass which has still some of the morning dew upon it seems to luxuriate in the change  We will now set off mutually refreshed he better able to carry me to new scenes and objects and I more disposed to explore and describe them  I need not request you or any traveller but a blind one to pause when he has gained the summit of a little rising in the road about a mile of HOLT The prospect from thence will as one of our bards boldly expresses it  Take captive the wild motion of the eye  by a thousand pictorial attractions The seat and grounds of Mr JODDRILthe variegation of wood pasture and cornfields on the uplands to the left and of the church its round  tower the house and gardens of Mr Hurd Mr Ouse and indeed of the whole pretty village with the refreshing sight and sound of the millwater below will amply reward your attention the rather if you come from WALSINGHAM to which for the widewasting circumstances already detailed it forms a very striking contrast What that lordship of Mr ******'s  was  antecedent to its honours being  put  to the axethis  is  and though in both the rise and fall of the ground are alike happy the manor of Mr JODRELL serves only to display the outrage committed on the other more lamentably Let me recommend to you to take a retrospective view of this landscape half a mile after you have past its front Stop at an opening in the road about that distance from the village opposite a detached cluster of oaks to your left and it will be still better if you are upon a residentiary horse you may throw his bridle at full length on his docile neck at the gate which you will find precisely in this place and he may entertain himself one way with the herbage within his reach while you are regaled another  or if you are disposed to cross the adjoining fields and ascend the hill to its summit you will be yet more gratified I stood charmbound I penciled what I now retrace with the penand I defy any one who has but a relish of the painter or poet the lover of nature or any lover or even the coolheaded and quiethearted manwho has plain good sense though he admits not enthusiasm but whose eye is a fair medium betwixt Painter and Poet not to be delighted "to the top of his  compass"  But notwithstanding I have here brought a middle man into this argument I may be suspected to have been influenced by the enthusiastic love I profess and which you know I really feel for the beauties of Nature I dare permit you to call in the most plain proseist you please as a judge and have nothing to fear from his sentence while I pronounce the spot on which the seat of Mr JODRELL is placed as one of the  most  lovely in Englandconsidering its extent In proof of which assertion I shall bring the terrace the varieties of sea and landviewsthe sudden shutting out of society so  that you are left as it were alone in the vast creationthe abrupt discovery of the peopled worldthen by a few steps your second retreat from or return to human kind and its busy occupationsthe invitations to solemn musing which steal upon you as you find yourself insensibly enveloped in literally a grove of ivy and the disposition you feel to indulge gayer thoughts as you disembower from thence into brighter foliage amidst the inspiration of flowersyour ideas expanding like the blossoms whose tints you seem to borrow and weave into as well as colour your thoughts and sensations Hence I conceive the Bard and the Painter derive their most vivid hues and it is I should imagine from such real scenes charming the senses and touching the soulit is from the magic force of such originalsimmediately under the eye and at the heartthat we have copies of Nature second in grace and beauty only to their originals Such copies may be taken at Bayfield and I can venture to promise your Genius that the door of the mansion will be opened to you  by Hospitality and that "as a stranger" you will be welcomed as a guest  A provincial history speaks of the picture of a Tortoise in the manorhouse with the following inscription  "This tortoise in was brought by Mr Robert Swallow from Smyrna to Bayfield and in July given to John Jermy Esq It yearly in November went under ground there laid and slept till the latter end of March In May she made a hole in the middle of a gravelwalk most open to the sun and therein usually laid nine eggs but never produced any young having no commerce with a male She was found dead in the earth in April "  The beautiful little village however which both at the foot of Bayfield and at the approach to HOLT forms so important and so lovely a part of the enchanting scenery is annoyed by one intruder  My friend there is not in the round of vice any thing more baneful to the reason dignity and every other sublime distinction of man than a virtue broke from its proper bound  even the noblest and the bestan  overcharged and intemperate idea of devotion  It is the lawless meteor of the soul that rushing from its sphere sets the little globe of man on fire it consumes whatever it approximates and is as far from the true the pure and the attempered religion of a benign Redeemer and I humbly hope I am not presumptuous in addingas distinct from the worship which Religion's GOD requires as the burning flame of a wild irregular comet whichthough for wise reasons it is permitted to affright the air as the terrestrial meteor just spoken of does the earth and the blessed and blessing orb which with a fix'd and steady radiance a permanent  principle  of warmth animation and glory enlivens and enlightens the universe  Hallowed thrice hallowed be  every  pure aspiration Sacred on that ground be the worshipped feather the idolized stone and the adored image of whatever materials it may be formedThe motive that deified it and that bends before it the knee of the untutored and humbles the spirit of the unguided shall give it  lustre even in the eyes of the illumined Christian and I doubt not of the Christian's GOD  But can philanthropy or pity can even Christianity itself my dear Baron with all its wondrous store of charities forbear a sigh or tear to reflect that at the close of the eighteenth century the best emotions of the human soul springing I dare aver in general from the most pious impulses should be carried to an  excess  which dethrones all the faculties the power and the majesty of that soulemotions which destroy at once both the means and the ends of religion Does not an evil of this giant stature grow out of the gloomy and terrific devotion which is substituted for one of meekness benevolence and joy  The Father of all true religions forbid that the spirit of toleration should ever be restrained GOD forbid thatin this country more especiallythe liberty of praying to the Great Bestower each member of the community according to what he feels most consonant to the sentiment by which he is moved and  to what he hopes may be most acceptable to the Power whom he supplicates should ever be violated Be religious liberty the most distinguished and most appreciated as it must ever be the most sacred part of British freedom would to heaven it were so throughout the worldwould it were the charter of the whole universe But is it not deeply to be deplored that in almost every quarter of the civilized earth there should more or less prevail an idea which by torturing particular passages or expressions in the holy volume of Faith from their true import our very nature is debased and the figure and form which we are allotted to wear made lower even than the lowest orders of creatures which are said by the very same scriptures to be put in subjection under our feet Weak ineffectual frail and in every breath we draw dependent unquestionably we arebut what wise or pious purpose is to be answered or how is the great work of penitence or of peace to be promoted by our being represented as the  "heirs of hell"  and that to make us  heirs of heaven  we must be "snatched  from the arms of the devil" or come to a pitched battle with Belzebub until  Though devils rage and hell assail  We cut a passage through  Or what good can ever be proposed what pious principle established by thus furiously holding out dark images of our "contemptible" and perishable state and often in filthy sometimes even  indecent  languagethus degrading instead of exalting the prime work on earth of Him who made us the creatures of his hands thus opprobriously implicating even the Creator  Such images however will be seen publicly displayed in various fugitive poems in songs hymns and prayers not far from BayfieldHall and in too many other parts of England Johnson imputed the great success which attends the religionists to whom I here allude to their expressing themselves in a plain and familiar manner which he thought the only way to do good to the common people and which clergymen of genius and learning ought to do from a principle of duty when it is suited  to their congregations a practice for which they will be praised by men of sense To insist says the Doctor against drunkenness as a crime because it debases Reason the noblest faculty of man would certainly be of no service to the common people but to tell them that they may  die  in a fit of drunkenness and shew them how dreadful that would be cannot fail to make a deep impression It seems to have been the opinion of this great man that the established Clergy in general did not preach plain enough and that polished periods and glittering sentences flew over the heads of the common people without any impression upon their hearts Something might be necessary he imagined to excite the affections of the common people who were sunk in languor and lethargy and therefore he supposed that the new concomitants of what we call  methodism  might probably produce so desirable an effect The mind like the body he conceived delighted in change and novelty and even in religion itself courted new appearances and modifications Whatever therefore might be  thought of some methodist teachers he said he could scarcely doubt the sincerity of that man who travelled nine hundred miles in a monthand I could name many virtuous men who have exceeded thisthe excellent Mr Wesley was onewho preached twelve times a weekno adequate reward  merely temporal  could be given for such indefatigable labour  The general  sincerity  of this sect I have fully admitted nor do I hesitate to approve the unlaboured manner and the conversationstyle  An apt and in many respects beautiful illustration of this occurs in the villagediscourses of a late minister of the Dissenting congregation in CambridgeMr ROBINSON who like his favourite Calvin answered well to the character given of that celebrated Theologian by Scaliger who pronounced him to be  "Solidus theologus et doctus  "A solid and learned Theologian his style is sufficiently chastened he handled the sacred writings as they ought to be handled I mean with an eye to truth with purity and with simplicity without any scholastic reasonings"  styli sat purgater Ille literas sacras tractavit ut tractandae sunt vere inquam et pure et simpliciter fine ullis argumentationibus scholasticis"  The subject is the beauty and advantage of Morning Exercise and so close does he bring the domestic imagery under the eye and so in unison is it with the train of thought I have been led into that one might believe the writer had luxuriated with me in the landscape of Bayfield and joined my regret at the dark shadows which are thrown upon the village below  "It is in the morning more particularly that  the ox knoweth his owner  and  the ass his master's crib  Then if ever man feels himself the monarch and to him who rises first all domestic animals pay their homage One winds and purs about him another frisks and capers and doth all but speak The stem mastiff and the plodding ox the noble horse and the harmless sheep the prating poultry and the dronish ass all in their own way express their joy at the sight of their master he is a god to them for  the eyes of all wait on him and he giveth them their meat in their season  Let us observe how much these creatures contribute to our ease and comfort through life let us remark that we owe them all they look to us for let as acknowledge the debt and our inability to discharge it without the supplies of Providence let us address our prayers and praises to that good Master in heaven whose stewards we have the honour to be let us lay up for this great family who have  neither storehouse nor barn  let us supply them with a liberal hand and for wisdom and prudence to perform all these duties let us resolve with the psalmist  My voice shalt thou hear in the morning O Lord In the morning will I derect my prayer unto thee and will look up  "When man walks abroad in a morning every sense is feasted and the finest emotions of an honest and benevolent heart are excited Above the spacious canopy the tabernacle or tent for the sun in a thousand clouds of variegated forms glowing with colours in every conceivable mixture skirted and shaded with sulky mists afford a boundless track of pleasure to the eye Around the fragrant air perfumed by a variety of flowers refreshes his smell He snuffs the odour and tastes as it were in delicate mixtures the sours and the sweets The village pours forth its healthful sons each with his cattle parting off to his work with innocence in his employment a ruddy health in his countenance and spirits and cheerfulness in his address that make him an object of envy to a king Here the sly shepherd's boy surveys and plots for his flock and there the old herdman tales and talks to his cattle and loves patting their flanks to chant over the history of every heifer under his care And have I only nothing to do in this busy scene have I nothing to say among so many voices Am I a man and have I no pleasure in seeing the peace and plenty the health and happiness of my fellowcreatures Have I no good wishes for them  O Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will cheerfully  LOOK UP"  of delivery in which they frequently  begin  their effusions whether studied or spontaneous although  I must notice that they frequently sink into the  mean  while they are sedulous to preserve the  familiar  yet I have to lament that they too seldom  continue  in this simplicity either of argument or expression but work themselves gradually up from moderation to vehemence both of gesture and tone and some times by a  sudden spiritual jerk bound up from the still small voice of persuasive remonstrance and good sense to anathemas and reprobations of themselves and rhapsodies to GOD are piled mountain high making Ossa indeed "like a wart" For the  sincerity  however even of these paroxysms I give credit in by far the greater part of the auditory I have seen not remote from the spot whence these reflections have just been drawn the most unequivocal testimonies of genuine feelingI have seen it my friend in the scalding tears that have deluged the cheeks of youth and of agein the uplifted eye that turning abhorrent from the wickedness of the creaturelooks to the mercy of the Creator in the now pallid and now crimson flushes of a distorted countenance and I have heard its voice rising from the first agitated sigh to the last distracted groan of a fermenting and heated soul But it is as the raging heat of the dogstar that withers the sweet herb and flower not as the benign planet that nourishes them Betwixt deep humility from a consciousness of imperfection and utter  selfabasementthere is surely as wide and important a difference as betwixt arrogant pride and the reverence which a lowly spirit may feel and indulge The first it is true "was not made for man" the second I cannot but apprehend was because in  thus  reverencing himself man reverences the Power who made him in his own express image The horrors of a mind overburthened with a sense of guilt will no doubt force a way into public notice from the most profound recesses of the bosom and in such cases the voice of Contrition may  cry aloud  and be heard afar off but God forbid this dire sentiment of acknowledged or even of latent shame should be general and even in those lamentable instances it is not often that Penitence forgets the meekness and silence which are her characteristics That a holy  fear  a sacred aweshould mix with a  love  of GOD is natural but partakes more of the emotion of a duteous child to a tender parentand what is the Omnipotent but the lovely Father of all mankind The point I contend for is that of seeing him and his religion drawn  in that character  and what I complain of in many of the votaries of Methodism is suffering the serious sentiment they truly feel not only to throw over the hours of prayer a headlong terror and an enfuriate zeal which hurries them out of themselves but impregnates their whole lives with the gloom of the grave The cheerfulness which smiles around them in the fairest and purest works of the Almighty as for instance they glow in the scenes of Bayfield at this beautiful season communicates no reflected complacency to many of the villagers below Humanly speaking when their lives are unspotted when the seeds of Virtue in their hearts have shot up into the pure blossom and yielded the fruit of good works they still  fear  to shew in the nameless relative and endearing alliances of life that they  ought  to partake of the innocent hilarityin which every bird over their heads every insect at their feet every animal which lives but to assist and which die to nourish themtill the last unconscious moment of sacrificeso generally REJOICE  "There are four sorts of people" says the  amiable Author who has furnished me with the example I have given you in my last note a few pages back "and each of these persons is differently affected towards our Father which is in heaven" The first he describes as being  without  Him the second as  against  Him the third as  dreading  Him the last" adds he "love and adore Him" Of that class I firmly believe are very frequently the people called Methodists But  excess of this dread  is often fatal to their individual comfort and renders them in a manner useless as connected beings The distraught or downcast eye the shaded brow the drooping figure the melancholy air and the heavy step too often mark their progress through the cheerful walks of Nature and Society Why is this The volume of their faith and the blessed Author of it recommend modest cheerfulness continually and hold out a sweet assurance that the temple of GOD the  everlasting  templeand surely the earthly one should copy its characterinstead of being filled with  general  lamentations ungovernable sentiments foaming expressions of them and convulsive  gesticulations exhibits to the virtuous  the fullness of joy  and should not even the wicked when he turneth away from his wickedness console his wounded spirit with the inexpressible goodness and smiling love rather than the desolating or withering frown of the Power "who pitieth and forgiveth even as a father pitieth his children"  Those whose  dread  overwhelms their love are in truth the sincerest objects of pity The Author abovementioned in his own familiar yet impressive manner is of the same opinion and by an allusion drawn from common life gives a lively representation of the  mercy  of the Deity as a solace from the terror of his judgments It brings to so good an issue the whole of this argument is so illustrative and favours the comfortable idea I so wish to establish that it shall close my present Letter  "Suppose I could take a person out of this assembly"he addressed this from the pulpit "one who had never seen the sea and carry him in an instant to the seaside and set him  down there and suppose the sea at that instant to be in a storm the great black and dismal clouds rolling thunders bellowing lightnings flashing the winds roaring the sea dashing ten thousand watery mountains one against another the beach covered with shattered timber and cordage merchandise and corpses this man would instantly conceive a dreadful idea of the sea and would shudder and shriek and flee for his life It would be hard to give this man a pleasant notion of the sea especially if he had been wellinformed that several of his relations and friends had perished in the tempest yet this man would have but  half  a right notion of the sea for could he be prevailed on to go down on the beach a few days after the heavens would smile the air be serene the water smooth the seamen whistling and singing here a vessel of trade sailing before the wind there a fleet of men of war coming into harbour yonder pleasure boats basking in the sun the flute making melody of the breeze the company even the softer sex enjoying themselves without fear this man would then form  the  other  halfnotion of the sea and the two put together would be the just and true idea of it Apply this and your confidence in GOD will be as much greater than your dread as his MERCIES are greater than his PUNISHMENTS  LETTER XXI  HOLT  Sept    THE distance from LETHERINSET to Holt is scarcely more than a mile but were it a league your eye would find welcome occupation The town of Holt stands on a hill which were I writing to a Dutchman I should call lofty but to a Switzer I shall only venture to say its top is airy enough for health and it is scarce necessary to observe it affords a sufficient scope for a prospect of vernal beauty for it includes a summary view of all that I have detailed in my way from Hillington Houghton and Fakenham the richest variegation of scenery perhaps in Norfolk of which indeed it has been called the garden Not  that I would have you attach too much faith to this expression generally though in this particular instance it happens to be true because I have frequently found men and books paying the like compliment to several parts of the same county insomuch that one might deem the whole district to consist of gardenground and sometimes where there is little preference to be made in any of the spots favoured  There has been a complaint as to water the want of which was severely felt some years ago but the landlord of the  Feathers  a good wellattended Inn which I recommend to you asserts that this objection is entirely removed  Holt is generally underrated by publishing travellers who have agreed to say "it contains  some  good houses" It may be improved for at this very day that I am writing of it I must give the preference to most others of the same size I have seen in any part of England It is extremely clean has a countenance of neatness something of an air of gentility and most of the environing cottages convey to the spectator an image of comfort  Sir John Gresham who was born here bought the manorhouse which he converted into a school endowing it with the manor which is now in a flourishing condition under the auspices of a very able and amiable man Mr Atkins The schoolhouse may be called in every sense the best house in a town where as I have said there are  many  good You saw too much of my questionary habits abroad to be surprised at my entering into unceremonious chat with some of my compatriot schoolboys who were playing near the house I singled the boy who seemed to bow to me in the most answerable shape and thus encouraged I set off on my interrogatory poney  "How many scholars my little fellow" "Six boarders""How many dayscholars" "Very few now Sir in harvest time"  "Why they are not sons of farmers are they""No Sir Gleaners" It was quite impossible to help observing to my little intelligencer that  I was one too  "The youth looked at my boots as if he did not believe a word of the matter  "And are ye all good in school and merry out of itand do you fight and make it up and play the truants bravely"  "That is what we do" exclaimed several together"  "And mind our books too now and then when we can't help it" cried a taller strippling than the rest archly"  "And I dare say you love nuts apples and pies as well as I did at your age Let me see there are five of you and that small piece of silver will divide into as many parts leaving a Benjamin portion for my friend here whom I have troubled with so many questions"  For an idea of the delight that attached to this poor donation you must go back to the blithsome period when a penny was competence and sixpence riches Time wears away the fine and pure sense of these thingsbut memory brings them back and the very soul hangs over the recollection when such small circumstances occur to us in the bustle of life  THE ride from Holt to SHELLINGHAM must be taken like many other things in this various worldon compromiseYou pass from the town of Holt almost immediately on a heath which on the left gives you nothing but fern thistles and rabbits to the extent of your horison but then your view to the left is recompenced by a pretty bordering of country and its villages spires c c True it is that the continuity of the heath for near four miles is a little fatiguingthe rabbits gambol without effectand I found the sheepboys with whom I attempted to converse even sillier than their sheep You have nothing therefore for it but to get to better things as fast as you canand a quarter of an hour's brisk riding will bring you to them for after rising from a deep descent which terminates this dreary scene the ocean lifts itself unexpectedly to view and the irregular elevations between the land and the water are finely covered with woodyou wind gradually along a valley on the lofty sides of which nothing is to be seen even to the summits but dark green broom and a few straggling trees  that slope almost to the vale and seem even to be themselves in fear of falling Pursuing the meander you reach the first Shellingham from whence I continue my Letter  It is remarkable for nothing but miserablelooking huts and by no means merrylooking inhabitants there is a large supply of little shoe and stockingless children  I should not however have omitted to mention that there is  one  nursery at WALSINGHAM besides that of the firgrove which is in a very thriving condition The youth of both sexes from the age of three to eighteen years are so peculiarly wellfeatured formed and coloured that it will be impossible not to distinguish themIn comparison of the little starveling runabout dabs that shoal on the beach grab for shrimps or muddle at the ebb of the tide for eels they seem beings of another world Let the flourishing state of these  human  plantations therefore be considered as a setoff against the barren condition of the vegetable nursery  as there always is in villages near the seaVenus you know sprung from thence They open the gates on the roadand scramble and grub and combat for the reward of a halfpenny thrown amongst themlike warriors fighting and tearing up the earth and each other for  "A little larger but as senseless quite"  different objects  and whoever is so lucky as to find and bear it off from the rest is as proud as any such warriors of the greatest victory that was ever obtained by the most illustrious butcher of them all which was as I take it the Great Alexander of Greece or the Great Frederick of Prussia or the Greatest of the Great Nation or any other great Conqueror who may happen to be your Hero my good Friend and my good Reader  The second Shellingham is a mile beyond the first and your passage to it is over some wellcultivated arable lands which conduct you to the good and indeed only inn of that place the Crown situated on the verge of the cliff where you will find a civil innholder good accommodation and a comfortable bed on which it being now ten o'clock I will prepare to repose and wish you a good night  HOLT  September  THERE is a brave passing and repassing of property of the HOLT Manor as indeed there is in the countyhistories of all manors The Confessor found or  made  thiskings you know are  said to have long handsan extensive lordship Since which there has been a grand string of conveyances grants and countergrants very interesting no doubt to the vanity of a lineal heir and at least as entertaining to some readers as might be to others the longwinded genealogy of a running horse or of a game cock but as this correspondence is not made for any of those readers it has all along declined the honours of pedigree either in regard to man or beast Yet in this particular place there is such a glorious uncertainty as to possessors and possession that I really must stoop to gather it up for you  From the first year of Richard the II son of the Black Prince so honoured in our annals and the last year of Henry VXIIof whom we do not quite so much boastintervened a space of one hundred and sixtyeight years Now here is an hiatus of the possession and different proprietors of almost two centuries during which we know nothing even of the name or pedigree of the lord or lady landholders either in this countyor in any other part of the British empire with the exception  of Wales for the histories of that principality "being extant" says an historian  "before Adam  and the language in which the Cambrian families are recorded being only known to the inhabitants of that country it is impossible for a  postdiluvian  writer to speak of their annals with a precision which may possibly ascertain the right line of descent from the  creation of the world  DOWN to  Adam Eve and paradise  "English records we are sensible" adds the same historian "are not so exact and that they are lamentably deficient this instance may be given among a thousand others"  It is really a most grievous thing my friend that I cannot fill up this wide gap to your satisfactionat least so far as relates to the county of Norfolk I have not time I have not life for such important researches but I think you may safely conclude from your knowledge of the human passions that every inch of ground was fought for lost and won disputed and maintained with the usual rage and rapacity under the more popular names of courage and heroism and that in progress of  the whole hundred and sixtynine years perhaps not a second instance could be found of a man of landed estate who like Mr ****** would have suffered even a crabtree to be cut down or relinquish as much land as would feed a thistle or afford a seat to the poor little bird that now and then peeks at its down Alas my friend what is the history of the whole earth so far as respects  property  but a tissue of private and public quarrels of conquest and of defeat of battle murder and SUDDEN death From the famous strife at Marathon four hundred years  before  CHRIST to that of Pontas in Catalonia when the French were defeated in after the birth of our SAVIOURor shall we carry it a year nearer to us and say to the conquest of the Piedmont Sardinians the bloody line might you know be extended in dreadful proximity to the times before us even to the crimson moment at which I writebut how does the soul shrink appalled at the aggregate of slaughter at the devastation of men the desolation of women and the groans of the blushing earth The specific account of the deaths in  that lapse of time and the little real private or public good attained by the then living and yet existing nations with the melancholy disproportion which has but too generally subsisted between the cause and the effectmight lead a reflecting mind to thinkbut it is amongst the subjects on which reflection loses itself and all that is leftperhaps all that is permitted usis to fall out with one another for the earth or for any thing it inherits as little as we can help and to have something as much  like  a wise and moral reasonwe have always a political or compromising onewhen it seems inevitable Secondary to the loss of  blood  in these "neverending still beginning" contests is that of  property  A very curious and I believe very correct estimate of both these as sustained by Europe through the means of the French Republic has lately fallen under my eye Perhaps it has come under yours as it is a translation from documents of which the original is in Germany but it so strongly corroborates the foregoing remarks I cannot deny it a place  The recapitulation stands thus  Loss in Territory of his Imperial Majesty  £  Ditto of his Prussian Majesty

then my dear Baron in money goods and territory       £  Should any one find this calculation overrated he will please to consider that all the countries conquered by the French nation were the most rich populous industrious and fruitful parts of the Continent and that the Republic has at present the best fourth part of Europe  Since this Letter was sent into Germany and indeed since it was at the English Press the wheel of belligerent Fortunehas taken a retrograde motion whirling more rapidly backwards even than it had gone forwardto the discomfiture of the ColossusRepublic and the remuneration of Austria but still proving that the blood and treasure which purchased victory in the first instance have been yet more exhausted in the second  under her command She has so  rounded and fortified herself that she is enabled to keep all nations in a state of perpetual agitation  At the bottom of the melancholy account we may still draw a dearbought moral "The picture of fallen states" says an ingenious observer upon this calculation "affords a striking lesson at this moment to surrounding nations but there is something peculiarly striking and worthy of observation in the fall of Athens"  "In Athens" says Plutarch "there were men not to be surpassed in the world but its bad citizens were not to be equalled in impiety perfidiousness and cruelty by any age or country" Plutarch was an historian not a prophet he spoke of things that had been not of men that would be  Athens was renowned for the polish of its manners and the splendour of its military character The important battles of Marathon  Salamis and Plataea had given new lustre to its glory and new power to its consequence Its citizens therefore aspired to a superiority above the other states of Greece Proud in their power and haughty in their success they grew arrogant in their demands and claimed supremacy They hurled the brand of discord and war amongst nations to light themselves to aggrandizement upon the ruins of their fall For notwithstanding their confused democracy within the success of their arms without had forced the other states of Greece into subjection It had awed them into a confederacy These conquerors went on to the borders of Egypt having at that moment according to Aristophanes a thousand cities under their dominion But their arrogance abroad and intemperance at home sealed the instrument of their fate THE ABUSED STATES UNITED  The destruction of that people was resolved on which claimed paramount power over the rest A single pique was widened into universal war and the arms of all nations were turned against Athens After twentyeight years of  bloodshed it fell into ruin Thirty tyrants started up to oppress her within and she groaned under the weight of her own calamities These monsters with power in their hands exhibited but deeds of blood and designs of horror All those who had possessed themselves of estates were put to death without form of justice And without pique or grudge those were sacrified for their riches who had sacrificed others for the same Their transports of cruelty and covetousness were so boundless that they turned  even upon themselves  and spared not Theramenes one of their own number The analogy indeed the counter part of this Athenian record is brought so  home  to the immediate history and prospect of a particular part of modern Europe that a striking parallel must be drawn in every eye that views and every mind that contemplates it  LETTER XXII  CROMER  Sept    A RESPLENDANT morning shone on my farther progress SHERINGHAM  SHERINGHAM is divided into Upper and Lower the houses in the former being nearly a mile from it whilst those of the latter are so close to the beach as frequently to suffer by the impetuosity of the tides Lower Sheringham is situated on a ruin of the cliff projecting on the beach and the cliff gradually rises on each side to upwards of an hundred yards the sea gains considerably here and it is not uncommon to observe large pieces of arable land carried away with corn growing on it betwixt seed time and harvest so near do the people plough to the edge of a cliffIt strikes a stranger with awe to look down A very considerable fishery is carried on from this place of cod skate and whiteings but especially crabs and lobsters with which this place and Cromer chiefly supply the London Market by vessels which take the fish from the boats while at sea There is a very good and indeed the only inn at Lower Sheringham much resorted to in Summer the dining room stands on the very edge of the cliff and at high water no land can be seen from the windows Sometimes thirty or forty fishing boats within a mile of the shore and fleets of three hundred colliers and other large trading vessels pass so near that with the naked eye you may discover the men on board At low water the beach is enlivened by the multitude of fishermen either drying their nets hawling up their boats repairing their tackle landing their fish or securing their lobsters and crabs in coys a sort of boxes fixed to the rocks which the sea overflows and fills at every tide This prospect may be enjoyed within doors but when abroad you will be charmed by the beauty of the country surrounded by richly cultivated and what in Norfolk may be called bold and lofty hills from one to the east of Lower Sheringham you command an extensive view of the seacoast abruptly bounded by Cromer lighthouse about four miles to the east whilst the eye is lost towards the west after wandering over both the Sheringhams  Priory is an object that will command your notice in the  degree that it has recently attracted mine and if you take your way to it by the brookor as they call it in this country the  beck  you will meet with a courteous reception from the wellinformed gentlemanfarmer upon whose grounds the ruin stands  Of the ruins the church which is near to the British ocean the whole west gavel wall with the arch of the window is standing the length of the church itself with the nave tower and chancel was about fortyseven yards the nave itself ten yards wide the choir or chancel fifteen yards long within South of the nave was the cloister the north and south transcept were twelve yards long each and ten wide enfolding chapel within chapel  He will shew you the spot  where the stone coffin was discovered about thirty years since by Blomfield and a variety of other particulars respecting the antiques and if you have the luck that I had you will see several very pretty moderns in the form of his fair daughters who happened to be then in the garden that fronted his house  Passing the farm you strike again into the CROMER road and if you stop at the first field gate to your left you will well employ your time in the survey of a very fine picture The well built comfortable modern farmhouse of the present times with its garden and nurseries mixed with the reliques of the ancient Priory Beestonhill and a similar ridge of smaller ones as its satellites bounding your horizon the ocean is seen through an arch to the left and to the right you have more expansive openings of it with various small craft and larger vessels  gliding over its bosom while Beestonchurch  The scite of Beeston Priory and lands are now in the possession and I believe the property of Mr Thomas Woodrow The Priory was dedicated to St Mary in the reign of our King John for Canons of the order of St Augustin  standing close to the beach serves at once as a pleasuremark to the traveller and as a seaguide to the tar  You then proceed by a pleasant green lane till you come to the village of Further Runton in which you have an elegant villa situated in a romantic valley screened by a continuation of the hills and rendered more picturesque by several hanging groves ornamented by a thick wood in the back ground consisting of fir sycamore oak and elm less injured by their proximity to the sea than they certainly would have been had they not been under protection of the glen The road onward shews on one side farextended mountains more barren of foliage yet not destitute either of cultivation or verdure and on the other the broadened ocean  spreads to the limit of your view You have Cromer church and lighthouse all the way in front as the vista of your prospect  The Norfolk Tourist and all the other historians have done what they could for CROMER desiring their readers will suffer its  situation  and the scenery around it to make amends for the town itself On the ostensible common facts they are all so accordantas to the  medioore  buildings and footpiercing streets and a few other objectsthat nothing can be added to the old accounts which will do the  interior  of the place further service  The embattled church has been a magnificent and is still an interesting structure It was built about the year its steeple which is feet high is square and richly ornamented with freestone sculpture the chancel is in ruins About a mile to the east of the town is the lighthouse Cromer boasts a great fishery for lobsters and crabs and within the last few years a considerable number of herrings have been taken on the coast  The fair is on WhitMonday which  draws together the neighbourhood To a mind that can receive pleasure from seeing others happy without despising or arguing upon the  reasons  of their being so this is a striking scene several hundreds of truly delighted beings of all sexes and ages in their holiday cloaths are seen from the cliff in boats enlivening the sea whilst swarms of people who cannot get boats enough to gratify their desire of floating impatiently wait on the beach which they cover  There is now no harbour at Cromer yet corn is exported and coals deals c received in return The vessels used are from to tons burden few larger at high water they are laid upon the beach and as soon as the water is sufficiently ebbed carts are drawn to the side of the ship and the coals shot into them as they are into lighters in other places but the carts carry only half a chaldron at a time as the road up the cliff is very steep In this manner the carts continue working till the water flows so high as to wash the sides of the horses and just to float the carts they can then unload sometimes sixty chaldron in a tide When the  vessel is empty it floats on a high tide and continues at a little distance from the shore and is then loaded with corn by boats as they seldom run the hazard of loading them when laid on the Beach lest contrary wind should prevent their getting off with the cargo  While I thus report what has been reported and seem to catch eagerly at these poor coalbarges and cornboatsor any thing  like  a curiositymethinks my friend perceives the difficulty I am in between a wish to promise him something worthy of his attention in this little seaport and the impossibility of accomplishing it  so far as mere town goes  which in my opinion is not very far  any where  out of the metropolis  But the  exterior  of Cromer is replete with interesting and commanding objects blending indeed some things which are sublime with many that are beautiful The cliffs and sands combine both these To the fullest extent of a various walk or ride the Beach is in itself an object of peculiar attraction It is broad firm and smooth I think beyond any I have seen  May I not flatter myself you have in recollection the Beach verses which were drawn from me at SCHEVELING in Holland in my former Gleanings and will it not be permitted me to consider the kind reception which I remember you gave them as passports for more seaside poesy I cannot but anticipate your answer to this question in the way most pleasing to me and when we are our own respondents as well as appellants and no one is at hand to put in a rejoinder or to make a single objection we are sure you know of our causeTake then what may follow from the influence of the poetic passion which I found rising at the view of the oceanan element which has in some respects advantage of the land even allowing the latter as in the scene before me to be eminently beautiful The evershifting varieties either soft or sublime rich or interesting of the marine picture moving on the face of the water its colouring its quietude its menace of a storm and the storm itselfconsidering only the surfaceare endless and if you add the diversity of objects moving on it each of those objects  presented in different points of view according to the different periods and humours of the air and water by which they are influenced it is altogether impossible that any fixed scenery however diversified by the changes of the seasons or of verdure should  as a novelty  afford such amusement to the eye and supply to the soul such trains of reflection  Since I reached Cromer I have had the curiosity to keep watch on the movements of this sublime object from a window that commanded it during the chief part of a day and evening both of which exhibited even in their own changes a strong specimen of the vicissitude of human things For beyond my power was it to catch the quick succession from shade to splendour and from splendour again to shade I passed many hours in my observatoryindeed most part of the day and evethen onward to the not unwelcome pensive interval when an embrowning cast of deeper shadowing follows the last suntints and precedes the rising of the moonthis was accompanied by a still pause as if nature was preparing her scenery for a new  change groupes of spectators were on the Beach many in the room with me were disposed to sympathy of silenceIt was sweet to attend the gradual peering to the full lustre of the loveliest planet to our vision in the heavensthe patroness of philosophy friendship and lovesoftener of our woe composer of our strife the solacer of the wounded heart chastener of our worst encourager of our best contemplations  Had Neptune himself sent his azure chariot to receive with a chosen suite of his seanymphs to invite and escort me to his coral palace I scarce could have been more awed more softened or more  enchanted  sometimes at the windowsometimes ruminating on the cliff and sometimes pacing along or listening to the surfsound the flap of the boatsail or the measured dash of the distant oar  My heart warmed its sensibility kindled its rapture glowed I penciled its effusionsbegun and endedjust as you will see themAfter a short pause I will retrace them so that they may go with this their introduction in my next packet  TO  THE SEA  TO THE SEA  HAIL wonderteeming element again  From Albion's cliffs I greet thee Thy expanse  This Summer eve just as the setting sun

sea has entirely swallowed up that town and makes hasty strides towards devouring Cromer also which now stands so near the edge of the cliff that in the memory of many people now living there upwards of twenty houses have at different times been precipitated into the sea  At very low tides there is an appearance of something which the fishermen call Shipden steeple It is hardly probable but that a large tower whose foundations were an hundred feet perpendicular from the surface of the sea after being tumbled into it with the immense body of earth that supported it and after being washed for many centuries by the waves must have been so shattered and dashed to pieces that no remains can be visible  where her flocks her herds  Spires turrets battlements her mountains where  Whose tops look'd down upon thy proudest mast  And whose capacious base was seated deep  Even as the secret chambers of the grave  Retire mysterious tide to lowest ebb  Roll back th  obedient waters and display  The mighty ruin of whole towns engulph'd  And acres upon acres hurl'd amain  From the defrauded shorethe mild abodes  Of useful mena harmless peasantry  Precipitated prone into the flood  And ev'n

POSTSCRIPT  IT was soon after the foregoing Poem was written that the illustrious name of NELSON enriched the list of our naval glory War must for ever be a scourge but the love of country my friend is an inborn emotion and to preserve our birthplace from invasion is a sacred principle that uplifts the filial arm throughout the globe  The public mind about this period combining its successive conquests seemed at a loss to decide as to the comparative merit of the conquerorsall in their consequences and at different periods it was well observed had equal claims upon their country and the atchievement of each in their order has put the nation in a  condition to accomplish the one in succession Like planets of the first magnitude it seemed to be the wish of the proud empire on which they shone and over which they presided to concentre their rays and after they had received distinct admiration the result of this  embodying  of their light produced such an unrivalled  magnificence of lustre  expanding over the island as must make the heart of every generous being whether friend or enemy kindle in the beams  The theatres the press the very pulpits of the nation have each in their congenial manner poured forth their tributes I have read many and could collect for you a library of several volumes dedicated to public gratitudefor it is a theme on which all characters are agreed and with respect to the grandeur of the actions and the good effected by them there could not be found perhaps in the whole island a second opinion It is one of the few very few subjects that have yet happened in the world wherein all men felt alike It seemed to be the anticipation of a sacred prediction and one of  the last to be  generally  accomplishedthe prophecy that  we shall all be of one mind  I would wish to bring the concentrated splendours under your eye and after a great deal of desultory reading in the fugitive publications upon the subject I have not met with any descriptions or remarks which bring the four victories so well into one point of view as the following annexed account  "VICTORY OF EARL HOWEAt this period France had not tried her naval strength against this country since her Revolution single conflicts between ships were not considered Proud of her feats on land she looked upon her marine with equal confidence she had then ample means for the equipment of a fleet had chosen men to command her ships of a determined spirit staunch Republicans and such enthusiasts in her cause as to take an oath never to strike the national colours Such were the men which at that time Lord Howe had to contend with After a partial action on the th of May on the st of June the French fleet "with their accustomed resolution" as his Lordship expressed himself formed the line and waited the attack of the British fleet In two hours the event was decided thirteen out of twentysix line of battle ships  Lord Howe only twentyfive  composing the enemy's fleet were dismasted and seven were taken This defeat they have not forgotten for the Brest fleet has never since wished to hazard another trial  "VICTORY OF EARL ST VINCENTThe spirit of the navy was augmented since the battle of the first of June but our enemies were increased and great disasters had befallen our allies on the Continent The Spaniards so recently our friends were against us The nation was threatened with invasion and the Brest fleet was only waiting the junction of the Spanish fleet consisting of twentyseven sail of the line eight of which were of guns Our force was but fifteen To prevent a junction seemed to every one impossible to engage such numbers dangerous and the junction was pregnant with the most serious consequences to Great Britain Yet under all these gloomy prospects this great Admiral alive to the danger of his country being informed of their approach to the astonishment of both fleets formed a resolution on viewing the enemy of that decisive nature of which great minds only are capable Four ships were taken the hostile fleet returned into Cadiz and has given us no alarms since  "VICTORY OF VISCOUNT DUNCANWe had to encounter the fleet of the power which had ever disputed the preeminence of the sea with us a resolute and formidable people Alarms for the safety of the country had increased with the confederacy formed to effect our ruin preparations of the most serious nature only waited an opportunity we had to watch a dangerous coast in the worst season of the year and the nearest to our own shores for an attack A most dangerous mutiny had broken out and the two Admirals' ships were alone free from the contagion and left unsupported for a time before an enemy's principal port After a blockade of near five months our fleet was obliged to quit the Texel but to the great credit of the naval department and the unprecedented exertions of the admiral and captains this fleet was at sea in fortyeight hours and that of our ancient rival defeated close on his own shores with the loss of nine sail of the line out of fifteen and three admirals taken The discoveries made by the leaders of the rebellion in Ireland have informed us of the danger of the escape of the Dutch fleet in a much stronger point of view than we could at the time have been sensible of  "VICTORY OF LORD NELSONAll the powers of Europe have looked with the deepest interest to the result of the meeting of the two fleets their wishes were well known and the glorious event has proved that the welfare of the English nation is considered essential almost to their existenceThe consequences to us and to them cannot yet be clearly foreseen If a vigour should be infused into their councils the civilized world may hope for peace and tranquillity at last We have done our part and will continue to protect the universe from the political and moral depravity of the foe The mind is lost in contemplating the destruction of a fleet whose commander conceived his position to bid defiance to  twice  our numbers It may with justice be added that the four quarters of the globe will feel the blessings of this splendid victory"  In considering four such atchievements and the respective periods at which they happened with the consequences had we failed in the first action it is fair to observe that they are so interwoven and indebted to each other that in the general transport of admiration and joy at this last laurel to our naval brow we ought to consider the four as one great link of national glory obtained we might almost add in the West the South the North and the East"  You will receive with this first volume of our correspondence when I shall have the pleasure of returning it to you in print which I may now expect in a few posts the particulars of a fifth triumph of the British Flag no less complete Indeed if we take into our idea of it the consequences which  might  have resulted from the enemy accomplishing his object viz the reinforcement to the halfsmothered rebellion in Ireland it must be confessed that the victory of Sir JOHN BORLASE WARREN was no less important than that of the illustrious conquerors who preceded him  There are parallel cases to be found in the history of nations and some of them wonderfully exact an instance of which occurs in two epochas at the period of near forty years distant of each other the one happening in the other at the brilliant crisis immediately before us  Xenophon observes that if the Athenians together with the sovereignty of the seas had enjoyed the advantageous situation of an island they might with great ease have given law to their neighbours For the same fleets which enabled them to ravage the seacoasts of the Continent at discretion could equally have protected their own country from the insults of their enemies as long as they maintained their naval superiority "One would imagine" says the great Montesquieu "that Xenophon in this passage was speaking of the island of Britain" A writer at that period who celebrated the naval conquests of England in observes upon this that the judicious and glorious exertion of our naval force under the ministry then established so strongly confirms Xenophon's remark that one would imagine their measures were directed as well as dictated by his consummate genius We are masters both of those natural and acquired advantages which Xenophon deemed necessary to make his countrymen invincible We daily feel their importance more and more and must be sensible that our liberty our happiness and our very existence as a people depend upon our naval superiority supported by our military virtue and public spirit Nothing humanly speaking but luxury effeminacy and corruption can ever deprive us of this envied superiority And whatever were the merits of the minister who presided on that day at the admiralty they could not have tended more to have lifted the country to a greater height of eminence and glory than that it has now gained at a time of much greater difficulty and peril by the talents energies and unwearied exertions of our present First Lord CommissionerEarl SPENCER  which appeared  in one of our evening prints  The General Evening Post  I have since understood it was given to that respectable paper by an approved pen  You will easily believe that the MUSES of the country have not been silent on this  inspiring  themeIt would have been  unnatural  An amiable poet and man the present Laureat has  enabled me to give you a  poetical  character of some of the above heroes and what I remember Dr Johnson to have said in a conversation respecting Goldsmith well applies  Sir a great and good man cannot easily be too much praised  Behold the veteran chief victorious HOWE  A faded laurel tear from Gallia's brow  On her own shores o'erthrown her naval pride  Her captur'd ships in Britain's harbours ride  From brave CORNWALLIS' sails in base retreat  Flies with inglorious speed the num'rous fleet  Safe in the sheltering port the timid foe  Eludes of BRIDPORT's arm the threat'ning blow  By peril taught with what resistless might  He knew to hurl the tempest of the fight  And valiant JARVIS by the Iberian coast  Pours on the faithless foe his scanty host  Superior squadrons rashly try in vain  With swarming numbers to usurp the main  Strict discipline to skill and courage join'd  A penetrating eye and ardent mind  Conceive and execute the bold design  His thunder break the bold extended line  And with a dauntless few he bears away  The wellearn'd spoils of Britain's proudest day  What trophies shall the Muse to DUNCAN raise  Whose worth transcends the boldest flight of praise  Will all the powers man's genius can display  Give added lustre to the beams of day  His virtues shine in native worth array'd  Nor want nor ask precarious Flattery's aid  Him to his senate Britain's Monarch calls  His praise resounding from that senate's walls  Walls where in woven tints pourtray'd are seen  The naval triumph of the Maiden Queen  The delegated sons of Britain's choice  In his applauses speak a people's voice  And while from Caledonia's northern skies  Prolific parent of the brave and wise  Bursts the full strain in patriot ardour loud  Of such a son with honest vaunting proud  England asserts her share of DUNCAN's fame  And claims the hero in Britannia's name  Nor ONSLOW shall the Muse to thee deny  The warrior's meed the wreath of victory  Or gallant BURGESS o'er thy trophied bier  Forget to pour the tributary tear  Nor the less known though not less valiant train  Who nobly purging Faction's recent stain  Rush'd to the watery field at Glory's call  Unprais'd shall live nor unlamented fall  All gallant race by bleeding victory crown'd  Who while life's current stream'd from ev'ry wound  Cried with exulting though with parting breath  'Now has our faith been prov'd'  And the public perfectly agree with the critic that THE HERO OF THE NILE has found in Mr SOTHEBY judgment to appreciate and genius to celebrate his exploits Of this assertion what follows will be a pleasing specimen and shall crown my own offering thus strengthened by every auxiliary support The tribute of an individual it is true is lost like the light of a taper amidst the universal radiance of a nation but to withhold its scanty ray upon that account may as easily be

different minds and memories it was observed that in the simple and seamanlike letter of the gallant NELSON there was a beautiful coincidence of expression with the conqueror of France our fifth Henry after  his  victory  O GOD thy arm was here  And not to us but to  that  arm alone  Ascribe we ALL  It was further remarked that when John SOBRISKI had completed the conquest of CHOEZIM in the year and had delivered VIENNA from its memorable Siege he sent the standards he had taken accompanied by a letter beginning with these words  "Je suis renu Je vu  DIEU  a vaineu"  SOBRISKI was afterwards chosen and very deservedly king of Poland  How are these virtuous and  elevating  humiliations contrasted by the gasconade even of the truly intrepid BUONAPARTE "We shall regain" said he "the ships we have lost in Egypt AT THE PORT OF LONDON"  As a farther proof of the sensibility of our national gratitude to the naval defenders of our Country take what follows respecting the late Capt WESTCOTE who lost his life in the Victory off the Nile He was a native of Honiton in Devonshire and as a mark of the high respect in which he was held and the deep regret for his loss his Townsmen have universally

mean to bring into the account certain wellbred withering maxims  which though they frequently turn the healthy into sickness and the sick into their graves certainly compliment our better sort of folk with the etiquette of dying politely No truly I speak of the charms of Nature in a sea village as Nature has made them andI thank heras she has made me to feel themas they enliven my view renovate my frame and invigorate my sensesas they open upon me the wonders and glories of the beautiful universe in the survey of the liquid element and assist me to enjoy them in fine as they inspire all that entered into and formed the feelings which with the aid of the Muse I attempted to delineate in my last  Albeit this town is not as I observed to be spoken of vauntingly you are not to conclude from thence that its habitations are hovels or its accommodations destitute of  comfort  a word by no means so expletive in England as it is in many other parts of the world CROMER to be sure compared with some of our highton'd wateringplacessuch for instance as Weymouth which is made royal or Brighthelmstone  which is made princely and many others on the coasts of Sussex Kent c c which are so beduked and bedutchessed belorded and beladied that they seem to think they have a  title  your pardon for this slip of the pen into a punto lift up their heads more proudly even than their wavescompared with these it must always be low water with my poor Cromer at sea and low land on shore but only  figuratively  and in the eye of  Fashion  for  naturally  you will find it all and much  more  than all I have described  There are to be found several dwellings sufficiently spacious for families and many that might well content bachelor or spinster travellersyea and with their appropriate attendants the  petitchien  of the one and the  petitechat  of the othertheir characteristic little dog and cat inclusive except indeed very old spinsters and bachelors Those "who libel the fair" assert that in England my dear countrywomen then begin to have less of the milk of human kindness and to that acquire more of the gall afloat in their constitution Yet  even in that  sore  case I know not where a disappointed and repining spirit can find more room to compose itself than at CROMER Such a spirit has here continual opportunity of meditating on the fickleness of men and womenof their want of feeling and of taste Both in the winds and waves it may perpetually find something analogous to false vows and the lovers who made themfor that every bachelor has had his heart accepted and every spinster heard oaths which have been abused you know cannot be doubtedand if in ruminating along by the margin of the main upon these dire wrongs any elderly gentleman or gentlewoman  should  be tempted to furnish the world with another example of what has been seen less frequently than the cometto witplaying the prank of the young Leanderthough not like him gaining the beloved by a swim yet find a cure for perfidiousness which is the same thingthere cannot I think be a spot in the whole world of waters where such a sublime undertaking could be attempted with more assurance of success than from any part of the  very cliff now before me nor can it be doubted but that the German oceaninto whose friendly bosom a person so disposed might be conveyed by a single jumpwould answer the comfortable purpose to the full as well as the Hellespont The libellers alluded to above would farther insist that ancient masters or misses might expect to be received as welcome guests by the brother of Pluto and  even  by Pluto himself and that upon more accounts than one In the first place they would argue the Roman soothsayers always offered to Neptune the  gall  of the victims because in taste it resembles the bitterness of the sea water and consequently the more bitter the gall the more acceptable besides would they say ancient single personages are amongst the consecrated things of the  infernal  Jupiter who is known to have a particular objection to the number  two  Consequently all the number  ones  would be amongst the auspicious beings sacred to himso that instead of leading apes in the mythological Erebus with which they are threatened the venerable bands will probably be  presented on their first descent into hell with a bouquet of the hallowed cypress and for ever after occupy the appropriate symbolsthe distaff the spindle and the scissars and sit like the Parcae on the right hand of Proserpine the dog Cerberus at their feet to guard them from future annoyance and the Lethean river to enable them to forget past injuries  I have thus been led with great good humour to throw out friendly hints for an emergency an affair of life and deathin the mean time all sorts of people resolved upon this world may be very well accommodated  If you wish your local habitation to the sea there are pleasant houses standing on the verge

COOK who are at this time in mourning for the last of their parents They let part of their house to assist in procuring a respectable livelihood their brother is a heartsound English sailor who passes

the right and to the left a wood which though within a few paces of the "watry deep" has neither been stinted of its growth nor damaged in its foliage I must however confess that in point of advantage a timber merchant would exclaim that the trees were too numerous had been planted too near each other  "Cromerhall is placed in an amphitheatre of woods which not only shut out all sight of the neighbouring ocean but seem even to exclude the very idea of its vicinity to that boisterous element whose continual murmurings are so mixed with the rustling of the trees as scarcely to be distinguished except when some powerful northwest wind asserts its right of being heard After a pleasant walk through the grove to the summit of the hill a most delightful view of the sea and the town of Cromer presents itself"  HISTORY OF NORFOLK  it must be owned also that in consequence  the vegetation is so interwoven the verdure would be thought too much in a mass for critics of picturesque beauty the whole green top is as compact as a colliflower and has really something of its general shape and clumpy appearance the leaves and branches being in a manner stuck together but had you been here for the two past days which have been so intensely torrid that the very sea earth and air looked overpowered with heat neither you nor a Price a Repton or a Gilpinno nor even the timbermerchant

the compassland and seaward whether made on foot on horseback in carriages or in boats within the circle of a dozen miles present somewhat to keep you well amused and bring you back satisfied and in good spirits to the point from which you set out  The particulars either necessary or pleasant to be known respecting those places when disencumbered of the intolerable load with which the county

scenes and objects which will afford you the most satisfaction in your little tours from this place and which may be said to form its neighbourhood will be found at FELBRIGG SISTED GUNTON ALBOROUGH ANTINGHAM WALSHAM and CLEY In accounts of these I perceive the tourists have followed one another I shall use the liberty of retrenching compressing or adding to as well as own myself indebted to the assistance of all  Felbrigg the seat of William Windham Esq is by nature one of the most beautiful situations in Norfolk In the park which is very extensive there is more uneven ground than in any other in this county nor has art been less bountiful the woods are large and ancient in the centre of the greatest is an irregular oval of about four acres surrounded with a broad belt of lofty silver firs on entering which the eye is enchanted without at first  perceiving why it is so probably from the contrast made by this unvaried green to the diversified tints of the other forest trees which are every where mixed in the rest of the grove and which the lofty evergreens entirely exclude  From another part of the road an extensive prospect demands attention through a break in the grove from whence the irregular ground of the park is seen to the greatest advantage Norwich spire at about twenty miles distance terminates the view  From the upper part of the wood the sea presents itself but not so strikingly to your eye as from the new plantation which will in a few years conceal that pleasing object from the eye but only to display it at another point in awful majesty  The house which has been considerably enlarged by the Windham family is large and convenient But the old style of architecture observable in the south front has been happily kept up in the hall and in the library which is well furnished with the most valuable authors  and contains a capital collection of prints from the best masters  "Mr Windam's plantations" says the author of the Tour of Norfolk "are designed to answer two purposes to ornament and belt his park and to extend his great woodland scene nearer the sea towards which at two miles distance it forms a grand bulwark from whence he looks down an easy declivity over a bold shore to an unlimited prospect on the German ocean"  The general utility of inclosing commons and waste lands has long been a subject of much debate I have already touched upon it my dear Baron in a former part of our correspondence It is in truth too important a part of national improvement to be hastily passed over Many ingenious and distinguished men have written upon and encouraged it amongst others the Earl of WINCHILSEA and Mr KENT The former with a spirit that combines public oeconomy with private benevolence has tried the good to be derived from this measure on his late waste ground upon his  own estate and Mr KENT is a strong advocate for it The facts stated in his account of the improvement made at Felbrigg seem to justify his conclusions he says "the parish of Felbrigg consists of about thirteen hundred acres of land and till the year remained time out of mind in the following state four hundred acres of inclosed one hundred of woodland four hundred of commonfield and four hundred of common or heath By authentic registers at different periods it appeared that the number of souls had never been known to exceed one hundred and twentyfour which was the number in in they were only one hundred and twentyone at this time they amount to one hundred and seventyfour" This rapid increase Mr Kent attributes chiefly to the recent improvements made in the parish by inclosing all the commonfield land and converting most of the common into arable land and plantations Farther to strengthen his opinion of the benefits of inclosure Mr Kent remarks that the parish of Weyburn  consisting of about the same quantity of unenclosed common and commonfields as Felbrigg did has not increased of late in population  A still farther light is thrown on the subject by VANCOUVER in his Survey of a county we shall visit in its turnI mean Cambridgeshire  The above diligent and accurate observer from a due consideration of the information he acquired in the survey of that part of England has made it clearly evident that the complete and effectual drainage of one hundred and fifty thousand acres of fen land would produce an additional revenue to the proprietors only an augmented rent of  £  That the laying into severalty or generally enclosing one hundred and thirtytwo thousand acres of open commonfield arable land would yield an additional rent of    That a general improvement of the coarse and rough     Carried on  £  Brought over  £  pastures amounting to about nineteen thousand eight hundred acres would produce an increased rent of    That the enclosing seven thousand five hundred acres of highland common would produce in addition to its present estimated value an increased income of    That the draining properly improving and enclosing eight thousand acres of fen or moor common would necessarily produce an increased rent upon its present value of    That laying into severalty draining and improving two thousand acres of half yearly meadow land would produce an encreased rent of    Carried on  £  Total improvement of which the county is capable according to the forgoing statements is  £  Stating the increased produce at thrice the increased rent hence  per ann  to the public  £  Which at thirty years' purchase would increase the value of the national capital to the amount of  £  It is universally acknowledged by all writers on political oeconomy that the population of a country must ever depend upon the means which it possesses and the proper application of those means for subsisting its inhabitants Britain at this time unquestionably possesses the  unemployed  means of subsisting in addition  to her present numbers  one third more  of inhabitants that such an augmentation must be deemed politically right there can be no question because the internal strength and productive labour of the nation would be encreased By inviting to early marriage the peasantry of the country who under their present want of confidence that their industry will enable them to support an infant offspring are not allured to the gratification of an early and generous passion which is doubtless of the highest  political  as well as moral consequence Hence the rapid encrease of the inhabitants of NorthAmerica where by a propagation only exclusive of the accession of foreigners their numbers are estimated at  double in twentyeight years  That the objects for the employment of the poor would be multiplied there can be no doubt when we look at the additional quantity of labour the country will demand from a  general enclosure  The fencing draining claying marling ploughing sowing reaping mowing threshing that will then be necessary to attend to over and above what the business  of the country at this time produces are objects which from their employment of the poor cannot fail creating in the most essential degree the greatest moral and political advantages whilst the idle objection that in the event of a general enclosure there would be more land thrown into pasture than there ought to be is too weak and frivolous to deserve attention  The pursuit of this very momentous subject has made a pause in the picturesque beauty of the village scenery in the environs of Cromer but you must not call indeed I think you will not feel it a digression  The enclosure of a country will very materially assist and add to pictorial beauty If long tracts of rugged heathground or of barren sand gapped and encaverned by the burrowing rabbit with here and there a solitary hut wild and desolate and made more sad by the wail of the plover can be meliorated into cheerful pasturage bounteous corn fields flowery hedgerows and future groves if the dreary hut can be replaced by the more comfortable  cottage and the sweet note of the linnet succeed to the plaint of the pewit and the cottagers hereby find a screen and a fence instead of any thing being taken from them Humanity itself will deliver in a prayer to the Committee of Agriculture for the enclosure of the comparatively  waste  land of a benevolent country  Let us return my Friend to our village excursions SISTED lies at the back of FELBRIGG Park and after turning the overshot wheel of Greshammill a little brook important from events takes its course through the parish it then by its meander increases the beauty of Mr Doughty's Park at Flanworth from thence again it rises in its claims by becoming useful to a mill at Alborough at length after making a pleasing labyrinth it empties itself into the Bure near Lammass  Upon the banks of this little streamwhich though barely covering its gravelly bottom abounds with troutare the remains of a once proud edifice the seat of the DAMMES what is most perfect of the foundation appears to have  appertained to a square building with large but tresses surrounded by a moat and the rivulet is embanked with a stone wall on one side for at least seventyfive yards from the building In a few years even these vestiges of its former dignityfor they crumble to the touchwill be hidden even from the antiquary The name of the manorSUSTEAD late DAMMESsome meagre inscriptions on brass in the church and the preceding account of the family preserved by Blomfield are the sole traces of people who once commanded the hat and the knee of the vassalneighbourhood The contemplatist however finds an obvious moral in their ruins If the former Lords fixed their happiness in pageant hospitality rather than in unostentatious bountyin pride of ancestry more than mental accomplishments in the smile of great ones like themselves rather than in the blessings of the indigent how would they blush to know that under the same roof their undistinguished dust lies mixed with the humble ashes of Elizabeth Lowe  Amidst the unmeaning tribute necessarily  paid to many families in a work of this kind observe the Compilers of the History of Norfolkmerely because their ancestors had though perhaps undeservedlyobtained favours from our first William  I must confess I do not myself see the  necessity  of paying  tribute  to the undeserving in any work though I might feel it right as an Historian to  notice  their  lineal  honours or possessions All the WILLIAMS put together with all the fortunes that may have pursued their favourites since the landing of the First is not a just ground for tribute unsupported by higher pretensions  let the antiquary or the genealogist permit us to mention the name of Saint CLAIR without tracing it back to the reign of Alfred for though we could perhaps gratify them with a long pedigree as she did not make this her boast we will only say that Mrs Elizabeth Lowe was the only daughter of Patrick St Clair a respectable clergymanthat she passed the greatest part of her life in the fondest filial attendance on her aged and infirm fatherand lest she should be interrupted in these tender duties to her widow'd and bereaved parent she continued single till  after his death when she married the Rev Mr Lowe Rector of Stukey the picturesque village already described  To give a just idea of the character of this unassumingly good being it is needless to string the commonplace epithets with which monuments are generally loaded it is enough to say that those with whom she conversed or corresponded were always pleased or instructed by her wisdom and that those near whom she lived were made happy by her benevolence  The house in which she resided you will perceive sequestered as was its mistress it is in the middle of a little farm which she ornamented with several small plantations It is now in the occupation of the very ingenious Mr HUMPHRY REPTON to whom the Norfolk historians acknowledge themselves obliged for many of the drawings with which their work is embellished and they  might  have observed further whose elegant taste in the disposition as well as ornament of ground has added to die embellishments of Nature herself  The church is a small building surrounded  by sycamore trees over whose tops appears its white round tower the ground rises agreeably and presents an engaging view to the north over an extensive lawn of rich pasture land intersected by venerable oak and bounded by a full view of the south front of Felbrigg boldly relieved by the magnificent wood behind  GUNTONHALL the seat of Lord SUFFIELD has been greatly enlarged and ornamented with entire new offices under the direction of Mr WYATT They are thought to be by far the most complete buildings for the purpose of any thing in the kingdom they are particularly worthy the attention of strangers as well for their light elegance and for conveniency in the apartments as for a beautiful slate covering which glitters to the sunray like spar they are formed of small square pieces of slate each fastened by a screw of wood  Not far from the house is the parish church which by the late Sir William Harbord was taken down and rebuilt with a magnificent portico of the Doric order this receives an  additional degree of sanctity from two Druidlooking oaks which grace its front  The situation of the house though on an eminence is said by connoisseurs not to have been well chosen It commands a large piece of water yet as the ground about it is flat and swampy this rather chills the sight than improves the prospect  The quantity of game in the neighbouring plantations particularly hares and pheasants is astonishing and they are preserved with the most rigid attention  to the game laws  So says Armstrong and Co so likewise must your correspondent say but the latter has something to adjoin The different sorts of game are not only injurious to the lands but almost a nuisance to the public road along on each side and over which they run and fly in every possible direction and with so little apparent fear of what awful man that general alarmer can do unto them that the common order of things is reversed for instead of the man terrifying the birds and beasts of the field the beasts and the birds terrify the man The coy  pheasant and the timid hare forget in a manner their nature and seem to feel they have  rights and privileges  as well as their masters at any rate they take their walks and flyings in a sauntering mode like other  protected  animals and that so consciously not to say saucily in the present instance that even the Gleaner's horse who is not easily put out of his way was somewhat flurried at a brace of hares crossing his path unexpectedly chacing each other for mere frolic like a couple of kittensand really seeming to care no more either for man or horse than if we had been two of the trees in his lordship's plantations and at the whir of the first covey of partridges that without any warning rose from a sunbank at an opening about a mile on the Walsford side of Gunton my poor steed was as much startled as his rider For the truth of all thisor what is a counterpart of thisevery traveller on this road will testify and it is in many respects seriously inconvenient but in counterpoise of this evil there is a great deal of good The noble owners of GuntonHall have a large share of public and  private benevolence the first is shewn in assisting the loyal defenders of their country with ample supplies of blankets sheets and other comforts of that kind and abundant proofs of the latter in the heartcheering shapes of wine sent to the sick money to the industrious and relief to the deserving poor according to their several necessitiesa benevolence that promises to be hereditaryas Lady LOUISA's cottage rides of charity demonstrate I leave it to the arithmetic of the mind my dear Baron to settle the balance as to this fondness for the remains of a favourite amusement the preservation of the game on the Gunton manors considering these liberalities as a setoff I have however to observe further in addition to these gracious deeds that Lord ***** not only employs a number of keepers to drive the game from the estates of his neighbours into his own grounds every evening with springingspanielsto prevent the depredations of the nightbut he underlets all the farms in his vicinity to hinder the tenantry from feeling themselves aggrieved Would to heaven my  friend all men in power could produce such  per contra's  of good for the injuries which are occasioned to society by their amusements  I cannot entirely leave Gunton behind us till I mention a particular anecdote respecting it No less than three families confederated to prevent the enlargement of the property of the manor namely the Kemp Briggs and a third family the name of which I have forgot Each of these had a considerable estate in or near Gunton and each had predetermined not to part with an inch of ground to the Harbords which is the proper name of the now Suffield family That power however which overrules human predeterminationsthe predeterminations alas of us poor molesighted mortals who cannot foresee the event of the next second of timehad ordered it otherwise one of the families died another was driven to one of the hardest circumstances to which in that situation it could experience in misfortune viz the necessity of deriving relief by a mortgage on his estate to these very Harbords and the third party fell off soon after by which means every  inch of ground belonging to the three came into the possession of the family who now inherit Long however before these singular events took place a very extraordinary expression is said to have fallen from a shrewd old man of the neighbourhood who happened to be at work in a wood which was then the property of the Brigg's Theymeaning the Harbords have laid their hands you see on the property of my neighbours said one of the Brigg's but I fancy they'll never get hold of  mine  what think you my friend My woods look rather in too thriving a condition for thatHey what say you honesty  I say quoth the labourer drily that to my thinking the trees  lean rather too much towards Gunton  The old man's prophecy has been fulfilled Not a twig but has been conveyed to the Harbords  At North Walford you will find a good inn a good country town and a much better country  CLEY is a small seaport on the northern  coast of Norfolk Of late years some baths have been erected for invalids but with little success It lies about a mile east from Blakeney and nine from Wells Blakeney was formerly a very considerable porttown and much frequented by your German merchants but Cley does not appear ever to have been of any eminence Yet inconsiderable as it now is it is memorable in history upon one account In the reign of Henry IV in the year the eighth of that King the heir apparent to the crown of Scotland the son of Robert Bruce being on a voyage to France was taken by some seamen belonging to Cley and carried to the King He was attended by the earl of Orkney and was going to France to learn the language The name of this prince was James When Henry heard he was taken he said laughingly "My brother of Scotland might as well have sent him to me for I can speak French" On the royal captive being brought to court Henry confined both the prince and the earl in the Tower of London where they remained eighteen years and so ended his  Majesty of England's joke Methinks it was carrying it rather too far notwithstanding But alas my Friend the very jest of a tyrant has often been the destruction of his victim for however the Panther may sport with his prey his very amusement is fatal he suffers it to linger in torture and at last puts it to death O what dire examples of this wantonness discolour the rubric History of Power too many of them must lie bleeding in your memoryand we will fly from the blushing subject to the place where even "the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest"  On a gravestone in the churchyard here you read"Of your charite pray for the souls of John Symonds merchent and Agnes his wife the which John  decessed  the day of January the yere of our LORD M and the said Agnes  decessed  the last day

same  inscription with the motto of Sir Clement Trafford of Duntonhall in Lincolnshire The occasion of its being taken by the Traffords is said to be as follows In the civil war between Charles I and his Parliament the gentleman in possession siding with the king was eagerly sought after by the parliament faction and his life being in danger he disguised himself in a coat of many patches and like a common labourer was found threshing with a flail in the barn by his motley dress and giving no answer to his pursuers who were making inquiries after himexcept NOW THUS NOW THUS at every stroke of the flaithe was taken for an idiot and happily escaped A man in a fool's coat with a flail in his hand in memory of the above circumstance is still borne by the Traffords as their crest and the motto to the arms is NOW THUS alluding to the answer made by this ancestor  In the churchyard is an altar tombIn memory of John Greve an assistant of Sir Cloudesley Shovel in burning the ships in the port of Tripoli in Barbary January  for his good services made captain of the Orange Tree by King Charles II  The coast in this neighbourhood has been deemed fortunate in producing many brave seamen and

also a picturesque treasure in reserve for you and altogether different from any yet mentioned the road winds into a sequestered valley shut out from the ocean by a bold uncultivated hill To the right the grounds  shelve from the road into a narrow vale In this little woody hollow is a village half seen among straggling trees the steeple is uncommonly in picture half of it is hid by a rising slope three fourths of the church obscured by a thicket The opposite hill rises with magnificence it presents a large inclosure under the deep shade of a very noble wood which to the right overhangs another valley and is in part lost behind a regular bare hill of a conic form which rises from the junction of the vales and almost screens a distant range of rising inclosure Immediately onward is a sloping tract of fields and above them wild rising ground with a white tower peeping from it The whole forms one of those pensile and yet not impleasing scenes in which POUSSIN delighted it  would  have been worthy of such a pencil it  is  deserving that of our DE LOUTHERBURG  September  th  YOUR returns to CROMER from all these places and a variety of others are in a superior style of beauty And your revisitation of the beach  and the marine objects after you have for a few hours embowered yourself in deep vallies or thick woven woods or between hills that shut out the main ocean and invite only the fresh rivulet has a peculiar charm I have experienced this today in a similar tour passing an hour both before I set out and after my return in a beachwalk In the former period it was low water and I never saw the beachyou have in mind its being one of the finest on the English coastso entirely perfect It was at early morn not a foot of any kind had impressed it Some seagulls with their heads nestled under their wings were reposing on their liquid beds a small birdthe waterwagtailwas running along the smooth expanse with steps lighter than those of Camilla over the unbending corn The fishboats had not returned with the fortune of the night one solitary man stood aloof at a projection of the cliff shrinking as it were from my eyes as they looked up to him in the degree that most likely I was diminishing from his on looking down upon me The sun had risen sublimely  and innumerable little rays from every grain of sand seemed to rejoice while they sparkled in his beams a sylphwing'd zephyr presently rose as from the deep and the scarce perceptible dimpling of the placid water looked as if it marked the place of its ascending from a couch of coral Its union however appeared to gain strength as it winnowed the light surface of the beach and others of the breezefamily soon emerged as if in pursuit of the fugitive The bosom of the sea was softly agitated as in sympathy patches of surf were lightly thrown and left partially on the beach frothed and bubbled every bubble of a different colour by the refractions of the sun and sea and clouds green yellow purple blue sapphire crimson and each of the most exquisite tintsand  they  might be said to tremble to the breeze which sported about  them  the latter however too light either to injure or remove them and every bubble was gemm'd and brighter th  the sandray Howhow did I sigh for some one whom I loved to point at thisfor I had never before noticed it I was entirely  alone and to the extent of the horizon for a few minutes the sea and the shore might be called  my own  As I glanced my eye along the lawny surface of the beach a thought with the aërial lightness of yet another of the sylphed train sprung instantly from my mind and with a reed I had plucked in the preceding evening's ramble I wrote what follows  ON THE SANDS  Thou emblem of the youthful breast  Thoughts fair or foul may be

correspondence You have given my heart a fresh proof of this and with all the ardour you have excited in that heart it thanks you Ah how sincerely do I wish in return for this gratification that I could reply to all your inquiries satisfactorily In regard to those which concern the "English Doctor" whom you saw with our party in Holland and from whom I had my Gleaning of Leyden  Vide  account of Leyden University by Dr Pinckard Gleanings Vol II Letter XLVI page of the fourth edition  I have to inform you that the insatiate spirit of warwhich plunders us in such variety of ways stealing friends relatives lovers and all who are most precious to us from our armshad taken this longvalued treasure from me He has been employing however his talents for the benefit of his country by attending our army in his professional appointment of physician  Suivant la Fortune de Guerre  he has visited several of the WestIndia Islands some of the Colonies of South many of the states of NorthAmerica and in the last place our angry sisterkingdom Ireland He has been in occasional communications with me from all these places He has an eye to observe and a judgment to discriminate and were I at liberty to give to you and the Public his marks and remarks they would form interesting Gleanings of interesting Situations and interesting Countries But although I cannot do this I am not without the hope that on some future occasion of greater leizure he will not continue to think it unbecoming his professional duties to present them to the world  The prescriptive gravity that in some degree still attaches to all the  liberal  professions in this country is not a little amusing to persons determined to see men and things as they really are Such of our younger clergy as would be thought canonical must be attired not only in their suit of sables but if not wigged must have the hair in a schoolboy crop to the nape of the neckthough this indeed is now amongst the insignia of our young patriotsor it must be worn so stiff in buckle that if unpowderedwhich is another right patriotic symbol and we have I can tell you our patriot priests and highpriestsit might pass on certain dark heads for what we call in Britain a blackpuddingin Italy a polonie enwreathed from ear to ear Yea and as they are to become pillars of the church it is presumed they think it necessary to stand as upright as the pillars of a cloister It is pretty much the same with our lawyersI mean the counsellor part of themThe flowing locks of many a templar and the fair redundant curls of many a barrister are the most improfessional  articles that  learned gentlemen  so are they all technically calledcould enter into a court of justice with Indeed were they not forcibly tucked under the tyewig before their owner appeared at the bar they might perhaps serve to ground an action of trespass but should a  learned gentleman  presume to open a matter of any importance thus headed and thus hair'd there is so little doubt of his losing the cause by the uproar of ridicule that must follow that I should think the client might come upon him if not for heavy damages or for a new trial at least for return of the fees I am not sure whether pleading a writ of  error  might excuse him to the court without a reprimand from the bench Then for our doctorsalas youth is in itself an unpardonable fault in an English physician and while nature continues this impediment it must  pro tempore  be disguised as much as possible Why my dear Baron a theatrical stripling does not find it more difficult to engraft the old man's beard and wrinkles on his unrazor'd lips and polished browin short to unmake himself  for some "wither'd winter rogue" like Old Renault in the tragedy or for some fashionable cripple like Old Chalkstone in the comedy than doth a youthful doctor of physic in this island to fit himself up for the solemnities of the medical character  Whatever may be the honours of a doctorial head interiorly not an attenuated hair of the exterior must dare to wander from the wig pharmacopolic unless disciplined into something of dignity a pale visage measured step and stately deportment are recommendations at the English medical college even in the degree that they are objectionable in an English ballroom and though a fine head of hair is sometimes given by nature to the sons of Aesculapius they must either tuck it very adroitly up as one of their surgeons bandage a broken limb or they must borrow the scissars of one of their apothecaries to amputate itfor these goddesses of scissarsthe fates and the college and even the  patients  themselves will have it so As if the gloom and ghastly appearances of the unhealthy reflected on the countenance  and dispiriting the air of the feeling practitioner were not a sufficient passport to the sick chamber  I have thrown over this subject a little more sport than it may soberly warrant but there really is a good deal more attention shewn to the apparatus and trappings of a profession than is necessary and one is sometimes tempted to think more respect is paid to the shadow than the substance to the wig for instance than to the head it covers and to the cane than to the sagacious nose which smells thereat It is well for your friend perhaps you will think that the good doctor who has made the pen thus playful about the paraphernalia of physic is not  caneinhand  immediately within hearing  I do not after all expect to remove old formalities all I contend for is that there should be no ceremony so absurd as to make it thought indecorous or derogatory to the dignity of the diploma or the long robe or the short one if their wearers appropriate some of the leisure that more or less happens in the most active employments either to write or to publish  what may be written on topics which are useful to the community whether professional or not In truth had our lawyers divines and physicians inviolably adhered only to their professional discussions the country must have been deprived of many of the curious erudite and beautiful compositions which now adorn it  It is with unfeigned pleasure I am able to inform you that after visiting so many various parts of the globe and contending with all the dangers of disease and of war our doctorial friend is at length returned among us and you will believe that I am one of those who hope that he has escaped from all his perils to resume the professional employment for which he is so eminently qualified in the busy round of London I do not wonder at your solicitude to know more of the Irish conflict It occupies the active world and the friends and enemies of England are looking on it with equal vigilance though from very opposite motives I trust you believe that I feel it too momentous and too much a parta  vital  partof the happiness of this country for me to have neglected it but I  waited in a kind of dread suspense in common with tens of thousands more on either side of the Irish channel for some conclusion of the point at issue after which whatever might be the consequence I had predetermined to detail the unhappy history of this new family quarrel amongst us so that the whole might be before you I joined your anxiety to my own in an appeal to Dr P from whom I had received progressive information while he remained with the army in Ireland and having at length "wrung from him his slow leave" I shall as promised now proceed to select and transmit an original and I am sure a  faithful  report of this dire civil dissension  "I wish" says the Doctor in his first letter on this disastrous theme "I could give you a more pleasing account of our deeplytroubled sister but unhappily her name transposed conveys too just an idea of her present state being in truth a sad  Land  of  Ire  Inveterate discord threatens her very vitals and she is in danger of becoming the victim of her own wrath Rebellion seems to have taken deeper root than was apprehended It is not only encouraged  by open and desperate example but supported by a chain of systematic secresy Disaffection and treachery are become the order of the day Many thousands of the deluded people are in arms against the government In the south not less than thirty thousand are supposed to have taken the field and there is strong reason to believe that still greater numbers only lie concealed till a more favourable moment of declaring themselves In the towns are crowds of  United Men  ready to revolt on the first tidings of success The loyal and peaceable subjects cannot be said to pass a night in security being constantly exposed to the hazard of being murdered in their beds and their houses or towns given up to flames It is no longer a partial evil The whole island is convulsed and order it is to be feared will not be restored without the shedding of much blood It is a contest between property and indigence Those who seek its cause only in political or religious grievances are deceived It is a  domestic  evil and of such a nature as to render it highly probable that it can only be removed  by an union of Ireland with England All other remedies will prove but palliatives An introduction of commerce and manufactories into Ireland must sooner or later be made the radical cure A spirit of industry and emulation unknown among the lower classes of Irish people is necessary to it becoming a peaceful happy and wellordered state It is not the idle dissipated mob of large townsnot the drunken vicious lawless overflowings of crowded citiesit is the sturdy robust peasantry the needy oppressed husbandman who has fled to arms something must therefore be radically bad in the domestic system of the country"  "Knowing my enthusiastic veneration for the admired and highly respected character of an  English  farmer you will conceive my surprize and astonishment when I found that in  Ireland  it was the plough and the spade which had been deserted for the pike and the bayonet that the peaceful cultivators of the soil stood foremost in the more than savage project of deluging that soil with human blood In England  the peasantry are regarded as the firm support of the statethe nation's strong defence They are men of independence virtue and patriotismSensible of the comforts they enjoy they feel a common stake in the country and are ready to defend itthey form indeed that class of men whom it would be most difficult to incite to rebellionSo widely different is their situation in Ireland that they scarcely appear to be the same order of people Having no interest in the state they have no inducement to defend itborn to poverty and bred in indolence their only portion is indigence and wretchedness No change can depreciate their lot  any  they believe may improve it Scarcely possessing the absolute necessaries of life they have nothing to lose in the contest and much to hopecertain of not becoming worse they seek amendment of their hard fortune in the great scramble of anarchy disorder and revolution Yet it cannot be believed that rebellion can have originated with this class of men They are but the deluded instruments of artful wicked and ambitious  leaderssunk in the most abject poverty and in the lowest depth of ignorance they are the ready dupes of the more crafty and designing"  "In every country be the form of government what it may there will be men of vicious minds of desperate fortune or of disappointed ambition Restless and dissatisfied these men regard everything possessing order or established form as the fruit of corruption and oppression Jealous of those of better fortune they sedulously seek their ruin and hesitate at no crime in the attainment of their object Deluding the ignorant with loud professions of virtue and patriotism they conceal their malicious views under the disguise of promoting the public goodGrant them the change they seek patriotism instantly expires and the public good proves only a name They exalt themselves to the summitgive loose to their despotic passionsand lording it over the deluded instruments of their ambition deal out tyranny and oppression without reserve To such men is Ireland indebted for the afflicting calamity  under which she groans The poor deluded objects who bear the sanguinary pike know not why they wield it oppressed with poverty they are taught that it can only be removed by the destruction of those in power To gain over the great body of papists the artful leaders had concealed their designs under the specious pretence of catholic emancipation but as the terms catholic emancipation and universal suffrage must be incomprehensible to the majority of these debased ignorant beings the cloven foot has been exposed and  equality  with  division  of  property  being more easily understood these have been held out as more ready instruments The poor wretch who holds his acre of land at an extravagant price is told that by destroying the government and those in power he will become the owner of his morsel and be at liberty to plant his potatoe and feed his pig without paying tythe to the church or rent to his landlord"  "This to him is flattering indeed It is the consummation of his best wishes Not aware that his wants would increase and his masters  be many he represents to himself the enjoyment of living without labour and anticipates the sumptuous feast of seasoning his meal of potatoes with the bacon of his own pig For this he sacrifices his homedeserts his wife and children or leads them with him to join the bloody standardand engages in all the perils of civil war"  "Nor is it only in the readiness of these unfortunate beings to execute the orders of their leaders in the field that the strong impression of these delusive promises is exemplified It is seen no less in the refusal of many who have not actually appeared in arms to pay the rent due to their landlords Certain of success they delay not to act upon the principle they have adopted"  "The great class of stewards bailiffs agents collectors and the like they hold peculiarly obnoxious Having been represented to them as odious oppressors they are regarded by the multitude as particular objects of hatred and revenge It is even perilous for any one to seek from the tenants the rent of the land  Some proprietors who have been hardy enough to demand it have met only a positive refusal Others have been answered with threats Some have had their houses burnt their cattle houghedor received other marks of illwill Many of the tenants not of the poorest order who have been known to have saved money in order to pay the rent have availed themselves of these distracted times and concealing the money denied they had any telling the owner of the land that if he felt inclined he might drive home a pig or take away some hay or straw but money they would not pay him It has indeed been made part of the system of the rebels to detain as much specie as possible from circulation in order the more to distress the country Such landlords who have been severe or only thought so or who have in any way rendered themselves obnoxious have been obliged to fly from their homes and seek a sanctuary in the towns So desperate indeed are the  "United Men"  or as they are more commonly termedthe  "Croppeis"  and so general the danger to men of property that many  gentlemen who usually reside in the country and have tenants living in the vicinity of their houses although on the best terms with these tenants have deemed it prudent not to hazard their lives by passing their nights in the country They have therefore removed their families and taken lodgings in the towns abandoning their homes to pillage in the fear of being murdered in their beds Many who are within reach are in the habit of riding to their estates in the morning and returning each evening to sleep in town"  "Such are already the evil effects of the poisonous doctrine which has been so artfully inculcated for the worst of purposes Should the extinction of rebellion be the result of the present struggle it will be long before a due sense of honesty and justice resumes its place Force may compel the rebels to abandon the sanguinary pike but the moral evil which has assumed the government of their minds will not be easily subdued  SPEAKING of the situation of the Catholic peasantry the Doctor thus continues  Waterford  August    THE very miserable state of the poor renders them the ready instruments of any change In the south and west parts of the island so extreme is the poverty and indigence of the lower classes of the peasantry that it were difficult to conceive a state more wretched Not finding employment in commerce or manufactories all are obliged to live by agriculture Speculative men have painted this as the happiest state of society It is not so in Ireland Every person being in the necessity of seeking land to cultivate and the farms being let as it were by auction the rent has become extravagantly  high This with the ruinous system of underletting which in Ireland is sometimes extended to a fourth or fifth tenant leaves the profits to the cultivator so extremely small that in order to pay the exorbitant rent he is obliged to subsist upon the bare necessaries of life The catholics making cleanliness and comfort no part of their creed experienced fewer wants than the protestants and have been thereby enabled to pay a higher price for the land The protestants not so readily contenting themselves with mere potatoes filth and rags and finding these the hard lot of the peasantry have abandoned agriculture to the papists and sought additional comforts by employing themselves in the linen manufactories of the north In the south and west the lower orders are nearly all catholics Being ignorant of the English language and speaking a tongue peculiar to themselves together with living separate from all other classes of society civilization has advanced among them with but tardy step Sunk in extreme ignorance they are bigots in religion and the ready dupes of  crafty illiterate priests Agriculture is their chief pursuit each becomes a holder of land although but to the extent of half an acre The peasants are not separated into the two great classes of farmer and labourernor do they assemble in villages as in England They live in little mud cabins distributed about the fields Each individual has a degree of prejudice or peculiar gratification in being a landholder Farms of one of two or of three acres are abundantly common and these they are ambitious to take on very long leases which not uncommonly extend to sixty years a hundred years three lives or for ever which indeed is but a species of perpetual mortgage the purchasemoney being allowed to remain upon the estate instead of being paid into the purse of the vendor who in place thereof receives a certain annual interest By this plan both parties are accommodated It is peculiarly convenient to the holder who could not advance the sum to purchase the land and the proprietor gratifies his ambition by continuing to his family the nominal possession of the estate and thus extending  his vast domain These small tenures bear no resemblance to the little cottage gardens of England They are not the picturesque appendage of a rural cottage home no trees offer their shade no eglantine woodbine or rose adds its fragrancedevoid of the green gooseberrybush of enlivening flowers of plants shrubs and all the variety of domestic herbs they form not the pleasing spot of recreation to soothe the evening of the labourer's day nor do their productions add little comforts to the table or sweeten with varied flavor the owner's scanty meal They are literally farms mere estates by which they earn their livelihoodsurrounded by a mud bank or a rough stone wall they appear the naked fields of naked cabins If they produce enough of potatoes to furnish food for the family and feed a pig to pay the landlord the humble peasant seeks no more A potatoefield is his paradisea mud cabin and a bundle of straw his palace and his couch A decent house would discomfit him The varied productions  of a garden he neither wants nor knowshis dear  prhatee  The common expression for potatoe  the loved apple of the island is to him the richest herb flower and fruit The father mother children and associate pig all live in the single room of a miserable mud cabin Potatoes their only food sour milk or water their drink and dirty straw strewed on the mud floor their bed The only exception respecting the pig is that instead of springwater or buttermilk he moistens his meal of potatoes with the water that boiled them He eats in the house and like the family sleeps in the chimneycorner In this wretched manner and in these wretched hovels do the peasants of Ireland drag on a wearisome existence Their scanty morsel by furnishing subsistence with little labour becomes one great cause of that indolence and laziness so prevalent among the Irish peasantry Being able to procure food by the idle cultivation of this limited patch of earth and it being difficult to obtain more  industrious employment much of the peasant's time is necessarily unoccupied and from habits of idleness he but too readily engages in habits of rebellion  The danger of revolution must always exist so long as the extreme indigence and poverty of this great class of the inhabitants remain and which cannot probably be removed while agriculture continues to be the only employment of the poor Had they further resources in commerce and manufactories every man would not be compelled to seek subsistence by tilling the land Variety of labour holding out to them more of the comforts of life they would be more strongly incited to industry the hoe and the spade would be forsaken for the shuttle the mattock and the oar and the rent of land and price of labour would necessarily find a proportioned level As therefore an union with England would introduce commerce ma+nufactories and various species of labour and thereby render more civilized and industrious the halfwild possessors of the mountains and the fields it is by an  Union  that the present  disposition to rebellion must eventually be eradicated Whether such a step will be proposed by Ireland or if it were proposed from England whether it would be accepted by Ireland is extremely doubtful From every conversation we hear on the subject I should imagine that  numbers  would be decidedly against it and it is even probable that  property  would be opposed to it for however beneficial it might promise to be to the island in general it is difficult for individuals and particularly those possessed of extensive property in a country to reconcile what seems to them the loss of national existence In our warmest patriotism we are too often less solicitous concerning the general good of our country than desirous for an ambitious display of its name  The great property of Ireland is in the hands of a few leading men who are mostly of the established church and form but a very small proportion of the inhabitants The great majority of the people are catholics and the number of dissenting protestants exceeds that of the national church hence in any contest  of parties the property being held by so feeble a minority must be always insecure but it must be more endangered than it has hitherto been before even those who possess it will freely consent to an union yet if an union be not the result of the present contest it will probably be seen that on some future occasion when they are more threatened and the danger more imminent and manifest the great holders of the property of the island will fly into the arms of Britain and solicit protection in a general consolidation of the empire It may be then too late At present it might be effected to the general benefit and tranquillity of both countries and to the particular advantage of Ireland But the public voice is decidedly against it and in how far it may be politic to agitate the subject at this troubled moment rests in the wisdom of those who are not without the best information whereon to found their judgment  Since the writing of these letters the great question of the union has been proposed in both houses of parliament in Great Britain and Ireland  The friends of Union have urged the inconsistency of two distinct legislatures in one empire contending that the breath of accident or a thousand circumstances which no human foresight or wisdom could prevent might destroy the connexion now existing between the two countries and by way of example have instanced the regency regarding which the two legislatures adopted very opposite principles  They also contend that the adjustment of was to redress existing grievances without looking to future consequences or taking a general and necessary view of the circumstances that it was not founded in the solid interests of the country and hence there could be no reason whatever for calling it a  final  adjustment  They consider the security of the empire not to rest on a firm and permanent basis while there remains a possibility of a separate parliament interfering in alliances and treaties or of giving different advice to the Sovereignurging that the parliament of Ireland might give a vote of peace neutralize her ports impede the recruiting of the navy and army and thus paralize the efforts of Great Britain and endanger the existence of the empire  The Antiunionists contend that no parliament has a right to vote away the legislative existence of a country by incorporating it with any other country  They object on account of there being no power which can make the result of the deliberation for adjusting the reciprocal interests of both Countries effectual  They insist that the arrangement reciprocally acknowledged by the two Countries in was a  final  adjustment  They urge that according to this adjustment it becomes so powerfully the interest of the one country to draw towards the other that a severance could only be apprehended from persisting in the attempts to promote an Union  The house of commons of IRELAND rejected all discussion of the question  The house of commons of GREAT BRITAIN unwilling to abandon the subject formed a series of resolutions expressive of their opinion and laid them before the crown to be communicated to the parliament of Ireland when His Majesty in his wisdom should see it meetand in this suspended state the subject remains at the moment before us  August    THE rebellion would seem first to have assumed its more active form among the protestant  dissenters of the north and as these possess the comforts of life in a higher degree than the people of the other parts of the island it may perhaps be chiefly attributed to that restless spirit of republicanism known to reign so universally among them As the flame spread to the south all the rancour and inveteracy  of religious persecution were quickly engenderedpolitics and the loud cry of freedom were lost in bigotry and superstition The republican banner and tree of liberty were superseded by the crosier and beads and profaning the very name of religion the quarrel rapidly degenerated into a contest between chapel and church  The crimes and cruelties that have been committed are too horrible to be conceived almost indeed to be believed The annals of history are searched in vain for precedent or parallel In former times those extraordinary acts of horror which on relation so torture the mind arose from the momentary impulse of raging contest In Ireland cruelty and bloodshed are made systematic and form a leading feature in the plan of the rebellion Not to think and act with the "United Men" or "Croppies" has been deemed crime sufficient to call forth the bloody and avenging cruelty of these most horrid monsters of human form At the county town of Wexford multitudes of innocent men were  thrown into prison and afterwards dragged from thence through the streets made a spectacle upon the public bridge and there tortured with a lingering death merely for refusing to forsake their families and follow the rebel standard The rebels while slowly and inhumanly butchering them with pikes aggravated their cruelty by insulting their pain and before life was well extinguished tossed their bleeding mangled bodies into the river At Scullabogue an estate belonging to Mr King at the foot of the rough mountain of Carrickburn upwards of a hundred of the same description of people were made the victims of their savage fury by being crammed into a barn and burnt alive Among these were two amiable young ladies of respectable family and fortune whose unprovoked murder adds new horrors to the catalogue of rebelcrimes They were long confined amidst the crowd of prisoners and finding no other hope of safety it is said they offered to marry any of the United Men who would protect their lives but all were alike insensible to beauty to tears and to humanity Amidst  the loud and sanguinary cry of "no mercy to the heretics" these unhappy ladies were thrust into the barn and consumed by the flames At New Ross and at other places great numbers have been destroyed in a similar manner by shutting them in their houses and setting the building on fire To augment their savage cruelty these worse than barbarians guarded the doors exulting in the shrieks and cries of the dying Did any one of the suffering objects chance to break from the flames he but escaped to meet a more lingering death from the destructive pike of these murderous centinels"  To such like cruelties have the minds of the deluded wretches calling themselves "United Men" been incited by the exhortations of the vile leaders who have assumed the title of priests These bloodthirsty ministers of rebellion teach their ignorant fanatic followers that to murder the heretics is to do service to GOD and honour to themselves and their holy religion Being offered absolution and believing that their priests can pardon all their sins these unhappy  beings strive only which can be foremost in perpetrating the blackest crimes Some of the merciless miscreant leaders calling themselves priests have already met the fate justice awards them and forfeited their lives on a tree or a gallowsbut that the loss of life might not expiate their crimes they have persisted in their conduct even at the scaffold They have insulted the executioner at the very moment of being launched into eternity even while in the act of fixing the deadly cord they have cursed him with dreadful imprecations and calling down vengeance from above have sworn to the rebels in their latest breath that heaven would aid them in avenging the death of their priests who fell martyrs to their blessed religion and their country's good  At the battle of Vinegarhill it is said that Priest Murphy taking a handful of musket balls out of his pocket exhibited them to the rebel multitude assuring them that each of these balls of lead had been fired against his body but that being made invulnerable by the divine spirit of the Blessed Virgin they fell to the  earth unable to penetrate or do him harm adding "so will it be with you be of good faith you are armed against the heretics they cannot hurt you" then sprinkling water on the ground called holy from having a bloody benediction uttered over it by this sanguinary miscreant he proclaimed the mountain sacred vowing to his deluded flock that such who fought upon it against the heretics would like himself be invulnerable and altogether incapable of being injured or destroyed of receiving wounds or death from the shells or balls the sword or bayonet of infidels So firmly had they faith in the doctrine of their priests or so excessive was their ignorance that when shells were first thrown among them instead of hastening beyond their fatal reach they collected in crowds around them to regard the burning fuse and remaining until the moment of explosion fell in numbers the victims of their curiosity and folly So great indeed has been their enthusiasm that in several actions they have advanced undaunted to the very cannonmouth and it is said have  even been ignorant enough to thrust their wigs into the cannon in the idea of preventing them from being fired upon their comrades Yet notwithstanding all their faith and in defiance of all the charms of holy water of solemn assurances and priestly vows not less than ten thousand of these deluded objects have already fallen the sacrifices of their sad superstition and ignorance Of troops we have lost comparatively very few for the most desperate attack of the rebels has been but the rushing forward of an impetuous undisciplined multitude mostly badly armed many not armed at all They have fought with desperation and had their discipline been equal to their courage the very inferior bodies of troops that have often defeated them must have found them irresistible  How truly lamentable that the ardour and enthusiasm which has actuated them should not have been directed to a more happy and laudable end How deplorable that the courage with which they have been inspired should only have led to the destruction of their country their kindred and friends Alas  that men should be so much more readily deceived into evil than persuaded to do good  How oft do the scenes before me lead me to exclaim happy  happy  England How devoutly do they call forth my earnest prayers that  her  people may always have wisdom to avert the desolating scourge of civil discord that they may ever duly estimate the blessings they possess and continue to maintain a just sense of the dangers of anarchy and rebellion  With what sincere pleasure do I often contemplate your peaceful Gleaning Ramblings in the different counties of ENGLAND fearless of pikes and rebels and needing no warlike escort to protect your path If I could envy a friend I must now envy the  English  Gleaner I behold him mixing in the jocund throng of the villageevening or view him musing in distant delight at the innocent gambols of a virtuous and contented peasantry At one moment I see him moving in pensive wandering step as I know he is wont from village to village and from cottage to cottage at another I surprize him soliloquizing on the  banks of a rivulet in the plains or amidst the mountains At this instant my fancy paints him noting the vivid idea on the spot as it rises At the next I behold him lost in rapture or reverie When I have worked the picture into life and am about to speak suddenly the trumpet of war destroys the pleasing illusion and tears me from tranquillity and from you Opposite and painful ideas crowd into my mind It hurries across the channel and deserting peaceful cottages and happy lands dwells only on fields of blood and cabins of strife From happy England it returns alas to afflicted Ireland  LETTER XXV  Sept    THE latitude I have given my loved friend to the great national subject so ably sketched in the foregoing abstracts of a highly appreciated correspondence has necessarily postponed every other discussion of matters on this more peaceful side of the Irish channel and the pause has been made most willingly on my part as well as advantageously on yours I wished to give you the best information on this great topic and I am fully convinced that our unfortunate  home  disputes in England or Irelandand may Hibernia ever be looked upon and treated as one of the nearest and dearest of our Britannia's family  our  domestic  differences my friend inspire our foreign foes with much greater confidence of ultimate success than they can ever hope to derive from all the armies of the

thou do that honour would thee do  Were all thy children kind and natural  But see thy fault France hath in thee found out  A NEST OF HOLLOW BOSOMS  The truth of this could not possibly apply more

part of Englandyou would meet with the  unbought  friends of their country volunteering her cause  and preparing for her defence We have a powerful army of yeomanry daily appropriating part of their

present energies as proceeding from those mingled impulses which include our connexions with Prince People Husband Friend Father and CountrymanI will call it thenTHE  PATRIOTISM OF THE WHOLE ISLAND IN COMMON CAUSE ASSEMBLED  It is on this great principle that you would observe a glowing spirit displayed in  all  ranks of people of whatever age or sex The children from something more animated than the mere mimicry of their parents collect the tiny troop and sacrificing the usual schoolboy pastimeclimbing the tree despoiling the bird'snest spinning the top and driving the hoopas well as their supernumerary meals at the pastry and fruit shops convert with earnest attention to military order most of their holiday sports to serious discipline while their weekly allowance and many a visitor's bounty go to the purchase of their military stores and every customary toy is now superseded by the flute the trumpet the musket and the drum while their miniature little sisters and small friends of the same bloomy age weave the laurel animate the infant soldiery and present the Colours  I had occasion to mention something of this immediately on my regaining this comparatively  happy land after bidding farewella long but I hope not a last farewellto the Continent  Introduction to Volume the First of former Travels  There is something sad awful and even afflicting in our last adieus to almost any place any people or any person even if some pain some injury and even some displeasure have resulted from our intercourse provided but  one  affection of a generous or interesting kind lives in the heart In a state of separation we cherish the recollection of that one think of it so often and in so many different ways that it seems not to have left room in the memory for any thing less pleasing less amiable than itselfBut where we have nothing to remember but courtesy and hospitality such as endear my recollection of you and your Country the short but afflicting word  last  prefixed to my farewell would be solemn indeed  Many have been the threats of invading this small but superb span of earth since the hour of my return to it when the infant battalions  began  to form Without servilely copying they even then literally imitated the manly virtue reflected from their fathers They have since had time to nurse their infant ardours what was then a sort of pastime has in many now grown into a principle and not a few of those who were the senior chieftains of the puerile tribes in those days have shot up into real practical heroes and already "done the State some service"  It is truly gratifying to trace the progress of a national sentimentto watch its course from almost a baby sport of armorya play as it were of the  small sword  amongst our striplings scarcely amounting to the flourish of drum and trumpet in our theatrical entertainments thence onward to the study and the science of armsIn fine to the dignified passion of men who unsollicited unrecompensed but by their feelings forego the accustomed sweets of ease and of competence yield up the habitual attendance on gainful occupations and at the very time that a great majority might think they had done the duty of good citizens and  good men by willing contributions to meet the exigences of their country in the  hire  of troops domestic or foreign and beyond furnishing their quota to which exigences they cannot be commanded here even by the chief citizen stop nothing short of becoming at much cost and more care  troops themselves  Fervently do I praythat since your coming amongst us is necessarily postponed to the time mentioned in your last heartgreeted pacquetyes my friend passionately do I supplicate the Fountain of PEACE that long very long before that aera shall arrive this dreadful though generous preparation for WAR may be at an end "and that not only my country but yours and every other now bleeding at every pore"may be suffered to repose respire and replenish Every prospect that art or nature can display in magnificent cities or bounteous fields every scene which man may enjoy or his Maker bestow is in a manner annihilated by warand the very sight of a  commercial  turned into a  military  nationas  is now the case of Great Britainwhile it reflects the image of public virtue and of patriotism mingles with it the idea of mutilated life unnatural deaths and a groaning world  With how much beauty pathos and energy is this subject enlarged in a pamphlet I have lately perused The solemn truths conveyed in the following passage are worth sending to the remotest corner of the earth at least whereever a musket has been fired or a bayonet fixed by man against man  "Of all the punishments and judgments of Providence" says Dr Gisbourne "there is none so terrible and destructive as that of WAR the horrors of which indeed are not at an end even when the contest terminates victoriously The tenderness of nature and the integrity of manners which are driven away are not quickly recovered but are exchanged for roughness jealousy and distrust and the weeds which grow in the shortest war can hardly be pulled up in a long peace How soon does the ruthless monster deface all that art and industry has produceddestroying all plantations burning churches and palaces and mingling them in the same ashes with the cottages of the peasant and the labourer It distinguishes not age or sex or dignity but exposes all things and personssacred and prophaneto the same contempt and confusion in short it reduces all that blessed harmony which has been the product of peace and religion into the chaos it was first in as if it would contend with the ALMIGHTY in  uncreating  what He has so wonderfully created Are we pleased" asks he "as forcibly as beautifully with the enlarged commerce and society of opulent cities or with the retired pleasures of the country Do we love stately palaces or noble houses do we delight in pleasant groves woods or fruitful gardens All these we owe to PEACE and the dissolution of this Peace however warrantably entered into disfigures all this beauty and in a short time buries all this order and delight in ruin and rubbish"  May Peace therefore be the handmaid  of hospitality to hail your arrival on our shore and may the same blessed power accompany you to the yet crimson border of your own  Had it however been within your power to antedate your visithad you the fabled wing of a sylph or the magic speed of a guardian spirit and could you transport yourself above the reach of hostile men or their bloody instruments from the opposite margin of the main over the German ocean even to this edge of our English landcould it be done by some aërial flight or which would be yet more grateful to me were we now wreathed arm within arm in friendship's knot as oft we have been in far distant climesyou would have  shared with meand indeed would have but just returned to our temporary little home from as interesting a sight as a season of general hostility can offer to a man of a peaceful mind and tender nature  The yeomanry of this town and vicinity have been drawn up on this most beauteous day upon a platform screened by a small fort bordered on one side by the aspiring cliff opening upon smiling woodlands and fields in high cultivation on the other upon the interminable ocean with a view of some guardsloops passing and repassing under your eye and looking proudlyas they glide along the smooth expanse in swanlike state as if conscious they were at once protectors of the land and sovereigns of the seawhile the liquid space between the cliff and those vessels is relieved by the fishing craft crouding sail to catch a newborn breeze and emulously stretching out to sea no less conscious of protection  The yeomanry corps here is regulated with  peculiar activity and zeal by a man  Mr PATRIDGE one of what is called the King's Council  of property unimpeachable in his professional and estimable in his private character and if on the one hand it is grateful to observe persons of independent fortune resign themselves in the first instance to pupilage so to equip themselves that they may become the instructors and leaders of others it is no less pleasing to see the subaltern body cheerfully submit themselves to such guidance and accommodate to the unqualified laws of that passive obedience which military discipline exacts and without which indeed neither army or navy can exist  Inasmuch as the cause is felt to be just you would have been pleased to share this it would have satisfied you to have seen the selfappointed corps duly arrangedgather together at the hour of prayer on the Sabbath march to the church and after evening service perform their exercise  and make themselves more adroit and perfect in an art by no means easy to be acquired and wholly new to most of them attended too by numerous spectators chiefly composed of the females or friends relatives and persons in the first and last stages of old men and childrenthe intermediate age and the youth of the district constitute the regiment a sight of this kind you are not however to suppose local and circumscribed but broad and general as the occasion for which the nation is in arms and with perhaps fewer exceptions than at any other period of English history we may be characterised at this moment by our great English Poet where he exclaims  They sell the pasture now to buy the horse  Now all the youth of England are on fire  And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies  Now thrive the armourers and honour's thought  Reigns solely in the breast of every man  Plutarch takes notice of a very remarkable law of Solon's which declared every man infamous who in "any sedition or civil dissension  in the state should continue neuter and refuse to side with either party" Aulus Gellius who gives a more circumstantial detail of this uncommon law affirms the penalty to be no less than "confiscation of all the effects and banishment of the delinquent"  But in this great impulse to protect the island there is no SIDE no PARTY  This brings perhaps to its highest point of possible perfection what a most singular man the son of a most singular woman has stated in a work of as singular excellence respecting that grand political desideratum so ably advocated and opposeda NATIONAL MILITIA I have already spoken of parallel cases and quoted one in proof of my assertion Here is another where many of the similar points touch so close they seem but parts of each other first brought to bear while I am about to transcribe what was written near half a century ago  The whole reigns of William the Third and Anne observes EDWARD WORTLEY MONTAGU in his 'Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republics' are distinguished by war abroad and factions at home Yet though we entered into both those wars as principals the military spirit of our people was not much improved our national troops composed but a small part of the allied armies and we placed our chief dependance upon foreign mercenaries  Frequent attempts have been made since that time to revive a national disciplined Militia which have been as constantly defeated by ministerial corruption or the malignity of faction Our  late fears of an invasion  and the introduction of so large a body of foreign troops a measure highly unpopular and distasteful procured at last the longwished act of a MILITIA Mutilated as it was and clogged with almost insuperable difficulties the real wellwishers to their country were glad to accept it They looked upon it as a foundation laid for a  much more useful and extensive  Militia which time and opportunity might enable then to perfect and which has been perfected my Friend  Much has been said and many assertions boldly thrown out as to the utter impracticability of a NATIONAL Militia But this is either the language of corruption or of effeminacy or of cowardice The Romans in the first Punick war found themselves unable to contend with the Carthaginians for want of a marine Yet that magnanimous people without any other knowledge of the mechanism of a ship than what they acquired from a galley of their enemies thrown by accident upon their coasts without either shipwright or seaman built manned and fitted out a fleet under the Consul Duilius in three months' time which engaged and totally defeated the grand fleet of Carthage though that Republic had enjoyed the sovereignty of the sea unrivalled for time immemorial  This effort of the Roman magnanimity gives a higher idea of the Roman genius than any other action recorded in their history  And by this alone we must be convinced "that nothing is insurmountable to the unconquerable hand of liberty when backed by public virtue and the generous resolution of a brave and willing people" continues Montagu "The difficulties and obstacles in either case I mean of making a fleet or establishing a good militia will admit of no comparison The Romans may almost be said to have created a fleet out of nothing We have nothing more to do then to rouze and diffuse that martial spirit through the nation which the arts of ministerial policy have so long endeavoured to keep dormant Great indeed has been the outcry of the danger of trusting arms in the dissolute hands of the scum and refuse of the nation in these licentious times These I consign to the proper severity of the martial discipline of an army for of this kind of people the bulk of every army in Europe is at this time composed  I speak to the nobility and gentry the traders and yeomanry of this kingdom  to all those who are  possessed of property  and  have something to lose  and from the interest of their respective shares are equally concerned  in the preservation of the whole  Of such as these the Roman armies were composed who conquered Italy Every Roman soldier was a citizen possessed of  property  and equally interested in the safety of the Republic The wisdom of the Romans in the choice of their soldiers never appeared in so conspicuous a light as after the defeat at Cannae Every citizen pressed to take up arms in defence of his country and not  only refused his pay  but generously gave up part of what gold and silver he was master of even to the most trifling ornaments for the public service The behaviour of the  women  too to their immortal honour was equally great and disinterested Such is the spirit that has been exerted and continues its exertion dear Baron to this present moment which a truly brave and free people will ever exert in a time of distress and danger Marius was the first man who broke through that wise maxim and raised his forces out of the sixth class which consisted only of the dregs and refuse of the people Marius too be it remembered gave the first stab to the constitution of his country People of property are not only the chief support but the best and safest defence of a free and opulent country and their example will always have a proper influence upon their inferiors  "Nothing but an extensive militia" proceeds the author "can revive the once martial spirit of this nation and we had even better once more be a nation of soldiers like our renowned ancestors than a nation of slaves Let us not be too much elated and lulled into a fatal security from some late successes in which our national forces had no share Nothing is so common as unexpected vicissitudes in war Our enemies have many and great resources and France will never want a plausible pretext for  attempting  to invade the kingdom Their last attempt answered the proposed end so well that we may be certain so politic an enemy instigated by revenge will omit no opportunity of playing the same successful engine once more against us  "No man I believe is so weak as to imagine that France will be deterred from such an attempt by the  danger  which may attend it For if we reflect upon the number of her troops the risque of or menwe might lately have said an hundred thousandcan hardly be deemed an object worthy the attention of so formidable a power For should they  all  perish in the attempt yet France would be amply repaid by the advantages she would draw from that confusion which they would necessarily occasion The traitors who lately pointed out the proper times as well as place for an invasionhow analogous againand the fatal effects it would have upon public credit whatever success might attend it furnishes us with a convincing proof that France  never loses sight  of so useful a measure A consideration which greatly inforces the necessity of NATIONAL UNION and a  national  Militia The unequalled abilities of one  Two  the ArchDuke and Russian general has given the present turn  man "humanly speaking have given a turn to the affairs of Germany as happy as it was amazing"  The following brief remarks ought not at this crisis to be omitted  "Let us throw but one glance upon the present situation of the once glorious Republics" adjoins Mr Montagu "and we cannot help reflecting upon the final and direful catastrophe which will eternally result from the prevalence of ambitious and selfish faction supported by corruption  "GREECE once the nurse of arts and sciences the fruitful mother of philosophers lawgivers and heroes now lies prostrate under the iron yoke of ignorance and barbarism Carthage once the mighty sovereign of the ocean and the centre of universal commerce which poured the riches of the nations into her lap now puzzles the inquisitive traveller in his researches after even the  vestiges  of her ruinsAnd ROME the mistress of the universe which once contained whatever was esteemed great or brilliant in human nature is now sunk into the ignoble seat of whatever is esteemed mean and infamous Another fate has you know  lately  attended her and yet another at  this instant  which may possibly bring her back under her Italian disguise to her former soft insignificance  "Should faction again predominate and succeed in its destructive views and the dastardly maxims of luxury and effeminacy universally prevail amongst ussuch too will soon be the fate of BRITAIN"  Every citizen is  a soldier in theory and should it be necessary I have not a fear that every soldier would in practice become a hero  And

motive august in the plan and glorious in the execution  Probably there has never been yet concentrated and brought under one point of view in a light so gratifying or that can so wellillustrate this subject to your mind's eye at this distance from the original scene as a sketch of what has been exhibited to the British Public while some of the last Letters of our correspondence have been printing offso late indeed as the fourth of the preceding month June three quarters of a year after the date of my describing at Cromer  detached parts  of what may now be contemplated as a  brilliant whole  And that you may have it in the best style I will give it in the  thoughts  of the nervous writer I have already made you confess yourself obliged for a splendid morsel in my twelfth Letter and you shall have those thoughts in the English dress wherein that Author's liberal Translator has so gracefully arrayed them  There are few sights so interesting grand and surprizing to a foreigner as that which the King of England's birthday presented This annual celebration became on Tuesday last a kind of national solemnity and every thing conspired to heighten its lustrethe delight felt by the King the Queen and their fine family the present general security the late victories the picture of public prosperity the military nature of the ceremony and the immense concourse and happy spirit of the people that attended  Seventy detachments  of Volunteer Armed Associations which had been formed  within a year  only in the parishes of London and its precincts were assembled about five o'clock in the morning in Hyde Park to the number of men of which were cavalry The brilliant appearance of the different corps their activity their neatness the exactness of their manoeuvres the beauty of the horses the rich elegance of the Colours and the satisfaction beaming from every countenance gave life and grace and combination to the scene  At nine o'clock the report of a cannon announced the arrival of the King who was accompanied by the Prince of  Wales  the Dukes of  York Kent Cumberland  and  Gloucester  and a retinue of general officers The King rode along the whole line the music playing GOD SAVE THE KING after which at the discharge of a cannon the firing commenced each corps firing a distinct volley after three rounds had been fired the whole line gave three cheers waving their helmets in the air and the musick again struck up GOD SAVE THE KING The line then marched in companies before His Majesty  The windows balconies and tops of the neighbouring houses and all the trees of the Park were crouded with people round the line at some distance stood an innumerable multitude the charge of keeping order on the ground which was given to some of the Yeomanry Cavalry of the London Volunteers was exercised without harshness dispute or the least confusion thanks to that popular spirit of order peace and method my Friend which here prevent those disturbances severities and accidents that in other places almost always sully festivities of this kind No impatience broke out among the croud but an instinctive and general respect was shewn to order  The Chief Magistrate and Soldier of the Empire received this day the sincerest and most brilliant testimony of public affection which was displayed in unanimous demonstrations and made amends for whatever anxiety and affliction junctures less serene might have created in his bosom a few years since it has left on every heart a glow of gratitude to the Almighty hand which in the midst of the general calamities and discord of Europe has in ENGLAND blessed with security the saving power of the Constitution and that moral harmony existing between a free nation and a Prince who must be proud to feel HIMSELF

filled up what a jump has been made in our dates the leap almost of a year You will permit me to explain  I perceive by the accumulated bulk of that part of our correspondence now before me in printas the sheets have been brought from the pressthat a Volume is filled to more than the usual complement of pagesand  quantity  must in the second place be regarded in whatever we presume to offer the public I am aware that little progress has yet been made on a  scale of miles  not so I trust in the measurement which will be taken by the mind's  eye in the point to which it has been the chief intention to direct it What that point is has been stated and exemplified in so many forms and on so many occasions in the course of these Letters that it would be mere reiteration not only to you my friend to whom they were originally addressed but to the public of which you deem them worthy to enlarge And though I am satisfied very many national subjects of great pith and moment respecting the POLITICS the MORALS the GENIUS the SCIENCE the PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER and the CHARITIES  On this benevolent themeone of the prime glories of the nationI am permitted to promise you new and rich stores

the whole worldour SUBLIME METROPOLISthough I am fully sensible that remarks on  these  and numberless  other  objects form the remaining parts of the correspondence I have had the pleasure to hold with youbetween the dates of my first Letter of the first of May to that which I am now writing to you on the fourth of July with sketches of the diversified scenery anecdote character and whatever art or nature  Among these I am proud to know you and many of our friends sollicit a place for the magical SYBIL LEAVES blown into my path by a Fairyand for the NATIVE SONNETS c  had to offer by the way in our traverse of many parts of a country which will justify all I have said of ityet they must unavoidably stand over to a more distant period  Alas  distant  period "proud words and vain" as our sublime but mournful Poet of the Night  Dr YOUNG  would call them  Poor pensioners on the bounties of an hour  as we are how do we reckon upon timethe least certain perhaps of any thing in an uncertain world  Your friend Baron has been much out of health for many weeks past and from some afflictive feelings his mind has suffered with his body or possibly by their proximity instead of relieving as such near relatives should have aggrieved each other This must it once offer an explanation to you of his late unusuallyextended silence and give another reason for wishing to come to a pause in the correspondenceHe is neither dispirited nor superstitious and will not therefore think it  An awful pause prophetic of its  end  but without bringing himself individually at all into the subject observethat this appears to be the crisis at which every man in the realm of England should  endeavour  to do something that he but  thinks  may be useful to the public The  mite  of the widow was an acceptable offering even in the Eye of GODthat which your friend here offers his country on the like pure  principle of affection will not be rejected and as the smallest gift should not be delayed he confesses that it will be to him like securing a ray of satisfactionwhich no event can wholly destroyto know that his tribute is placed beyond the mercy of accident or the reach of death itself  To you my friend the delay of what is intended at the first opportunity should it never present itselfthough perhaps it may speedily can be no disappointment were the whole of the correspondence now before you what could it more than give you back in print what you have already read in manuscript except indeed what casual information may since have been added in the notes of reference the result of farther research and reflection as in the present Volume  Mean time I cannot but lament that the time of your proposed journey and voyage are postponed to a date yet more remote The motive of your delay is honourable to you but the heart is often afflicted by what it approves a little selfishly perhaps but very  sincerelymine I must own feels in the present instance the sickness of  Hope deferred  That however is a malady which alas we must all feel by turns but still it is preferable to no  Hope at all  despair being the only incurable disease of the soul And the  idea  even should it at length prove only such that at such a point of time we shall be reunited to those we lovethat we shall see converse with and embrace themis worth cherishingfondly cherishingthough the intermediate space should be long dreary and unjoyous  But in  your  case the absence of a friend isI will not say atonedmitigated and consoled While Heaven permits you to be encompassed as now it doth by so many of its distinguished blessings a lovely partner a beautiful family competent fortunes uninterrupted health and now the prospectclear of the clouds and darkness

yousuch guestsI had well nigh called them angelguestsemparadise your bower and grace your roof it would be to repeat the fault by which we are told man first  fell  from an  almost  angelic state to repine  Yet shall I confess that while I can thus reason and thus feel the truth the force of that reasoning I peruse and reperuse that passage of your last which expresseswith every fervour and mark of truthyour sollicitude your pain at the necessity of being longer detained Without being thought to encourage the repining spirit shall I dare even to acknowledge that those expressions were and still remain the most in favour with my selfish heart The factand whatever of fault there may be in itcannot be denied Yet I fear the confession is not made with all the penitence which the holy fathers might require for I cannot truly say the sollicitude orpardon meeven the pain it bringsis altogether unwelcome to me though I would have no more pain inflicted Baron thanwhile you  are grateful for the abundant good you enjoy at hometo feel that your felicity would be more  complete  were the society of your fardistant Correspondent added unto you  The head and front of my offending  Hath this extentno more  and this I know you will forgive You are a friend not a confessor yet even in the former indulgent character I ought methinks to offer you all the palliatives I can and one of no slight consideration is at hand I have of late more than usual stood in need of the  lenitives  of affection for besides mere derangement of health I have been suffering and very heavily from its  corrosives  A man whom you honour with your affection has been for some time conflicting with himself from a threatened act of oppression under a generous and indignant sense of which he wrote what a firm though agitated mind dictated I mention it to you now because the wound is in a great measure cured by the remedy and you are not now to condole but to gratulate  "Let the unfortunate" says one of the best historians of our England  HUME  and one of the most acute observers of general nature "let the Unhappy turn to the works of the philosophers and moralists to the noble effusions of intellectual beings there when all else fails may a spring of comfort be found where Adversity cannot prevent us from slaking our thirst" The medicine is good but when the sick or hurt mind can "minister to its own disease" without resorting to  distant  reservoirs for the restorative when the mental invalid can repair to a fountain much nearer homewhen he can draw the cordial from his  own breast  the draught is yet more healing more anodyne and more natural The sufferer to whom I allude has had recourse to these  living  waters andon the chance of extending the healing power to others
