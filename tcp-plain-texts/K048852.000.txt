 The Wrath of Man praising GOD  A SERMON Preached in the High Church of  Edinburgh May  th  Before His GRACE the Lord High Commissioner TO THE General Assembly of the CHURCH of SCOTLAND  By HUGH BLAIR  A M  One of the Ministers of  Canongate  Published by Desire of the Lord High Commissioner  EDINBURGH  Printed by R FLEMING For A KINCAID MDCCXLVI  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE ALEXANDER Earl of LEAVEN HIS MAJESTY's HIGH COMMISSIONER TO THE General Assembly of the Church of  SCOTLAND  This SERMON is inscrib'd with the highest Respect and Esteem by  His Grace's most obliged most humble and most obedient Servant HUGH BLAIR  A SERMON Preached in the High Church of Edinburgh  May th  PSALM lxxvi  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain  IN this Psalm some remarkable Victory and Deliverance is celebrated which the  Jewish  Nation had obtained A Deliverance in which the Hand of God visibly appeared rescuing his People from imminent Danger Very probably it was written in  Hezekiah  's Reign on Occasion of their being delivered from the formidable Invasion of  Sennacherib  and the  Assyrian  Army when the Angel of the Lord in one Night discomfited all their Host and smote them with sudden Destruction  King xix  To this signal  Interposition of the Divine Arm these Expressions in the Context may be naturally applied  There brake he the arrows of the bow the shield the sword and the battlethe stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands At thy rebuke O God of Jacob both the chariot and the horse are cast into a dead sleep  In the Words of our Text we have the Psalmist's religious and wise Reflection upon all these Events upon the violent Designs of their Enemies and the Issue to which Providence brought these Designs  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain  The wrath of man  that is all the Rage and the impetuous Passion of wicked Men with the violent Effects of War Persecution Oppression and other Disorders it produces in the World All these the Psalmist tells us  shall praise God  Not indeed by the Intention and Design nor by the native Tendency of the  wrath of man  But by these wise and good Purposes which the Providence of God causes it to  accomplish  from this Poison  extracting  Health and of Things most unwilling and unapt in themselves to yield him Glory  forming  Instruments of Good So that tho' the  wrath of man  as the Apostle  James  speaks  worketh not  of itself  the righteousness of God a  it is nevertheless  forced  and  compelled  to minister to his  Praise  The Psalmist adds  the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain  That is GOD will give Way to the Wrath of Man and allow it Scope  so far  as it answers his good Purposes and works his Praise the rest of it shall be curb'd and bound up When it would attempt to go beyond its prescrib'd Limit he says to it as to the Waters of the Sea  Hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed  Jam i  All this the last Issue of Things shall fully verify and declare When we shall be able more clearly to trace the divine Administration through its several Steps by seeing the Consummation of the whole In some Cases it may be reserved for this Period only to disclose and unfold the mysterious Wisdom of Heaven But in general as much of the divine Conduct and Wisdom is at present manifest as gives just Ground for this Observation that the  wrath of man praises God  now before the whole World  Job xxxviii  This was the Meditation  of the Psalmist after Victory and Conquest As we my Brethren like him have lately seen the  wrath of man  raging around us in all its Violence and in the midst of its Fury have seen it restrain'd and check'd by the powerful Hand of GOD such a Meditation must be acknowledged very suitable and becoming now That by serious Contemplation of the Ways of Providence we may learn to view these Revolutions which befal Mankind with the devout Sentiments of our Psalmist  IN prosecuting this Subject  I shall endeavour to illustrate and confirm the Observation in my Text by showing in what Manner the  wrath of man  is made to  praise God  And then I shall lead your Thoughts to the Improvement we ought to make of such a Meditation  THE different Ways in which the  wrath of man  turns out to the  praise of God  are reducible chiefly to these three I As it  manifests  most brightly the glorious  Perfections  of GOD in the Government of the Universe II As it  illustrates  and  improves  the  Virtues  of good Men and thus  beautifies  his Church and People And III As it is made the  Means of  working  out their greater  Prosperity  and  Happiness  upon the whole  I I say the  wrath of man praises God  as it gives Occasion for the brighter and more illustrious  Discovery of his Perfections  in the  Government  of the WorldThe  Beauty  and  Order  of the Universe is much heighten'd by its being so complicated a System In which there are such a Variety of Springs to be adjusted and so many different Movements to be regulated and kept in Order Interfering Interests and jarring Passions  ballanc'd  in such Manner against one another violent and unruly Men kept under such a wise and regular  Controul  and the  wrath of man  made so to know its  Place  that how opposite soever the several Motions seem to be yet they  concur  and meet at last in one End This renders a Divine Hand  sensible  and  illustrious  This opens a more wonderful Prospect of the Divine Government than if all its Subjects were loyal and willingly obedient and makes that Power and Wisdom which can render such  intractable  Things subservient to the Ends of Justice and Goodness appear so much the more worthy of everlasting Admiration and Praise More particularly  THE  wrath of man  redounds to the Praise of GOD's  almighty Power  as this is display'd in his restraining and baffling at Pleasure all its Fury and WickednessTo reign with sovereign Command amidst the most disorder'd and turbulent State of Things is the peculiar Glory of Omnipotence Hence we find GOD describ'd in Scripture  sitting on the flood riding on the wings of the wind dwelling in the darkness and the tempest  As  he stills the raging of the seas and the noise of their waves  so  he stills the tumults of the people  When the Passions of Men are most  agitated  and  inflamed  and their violent Designs just ripe for bursting into Execution how oft by some unforeseen Turn of Providence hath he call'd upon Mankind to observe that there is one  higher than the highest on Earth  who can baffle all their Devices with the Breath of his Mouth and command the Earth  to be still before him  When proud Fleets cover the Ocean he blows with his Wind and they are scattered When mighty Armies go forth to Battle in all the Glory of human Strength with what  Majesty  does an omnipotent Arm sometimes appear As in the Case of haughty  Sennacherib  and that boasted Tempest of Wrath he threatned to pour upon all the  Jewish  Nation  I will put my hook  says GOD  in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest  Kings xix  In that Night the destroying Angel smote the Host And he departed we are told with  shame of face to his own land When the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing when the kings of the earth set themselves and its rulers take counsel together he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the Lord shall hold them in derision then shall he speak to them in wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure  Psal ii  Again  THE  wrath of man  is made to praise the  Wisdom  as well as the Power of GOD when he makes the unruly Passions of bad Men  work  in a secret Way towards Ends by them altogether unforeseen This most eminently displays the unsearchable Depths of the Divine Counsel when we see them render'd the  Ministers  of Providence to forward Designs which they intended to destroyThus how surprising is it in the History of  Joseph  that the Cruelty of his Brethren the Lewdness  and Resentment of his Mistress and the Wrath of  Potiphar  should all  conspire  to his Advancement and prove the  Steps  by which this persecuted and friendless Man rose till he became the Saviour of all his Kindred How remarkably did the  wrath of man  praise GOD in the case of  Daniel  The Malice of his Enemies had thrown him into the Den of Lions for worshipping GOD they presumed his Destruction accomplish'd and themselves completely delivered from so formidable a Rival yet this very Event prov'd not only the Occasion of  Daniel's  greater Honour and their utter Ruin but of a Decree through all the Kingdom of the  Medes  that all Men should worship and fear before the GOD of  Daniel  Dan vi  Thus GOD  snareth the wicked in the works of their hands  Pasl ix  And  erects  his own Counsel upon the Ruin of theirs These Things which view'd apart appear to us  Spots  in the divine Administration when considered in their  Connection  with all the Train of succeeding Events often add a great  Lustre  and  Beauty  to it Were our Views extensive enough we should discern it always to be thus  I might observe further that the  wrath of man  praises the  Goodness  of GOD in all these Purposes of general  Benefit  both  temporal  and  spiritual  to which his Providence renders it subservient But these will fall to be afterwards considered I therefore proceed to observe  THAT the  wrath of man  is made to praise the Divine  Justice  In many Cases it is sufficient for this End that GOD let loose upon bad Men for their own  Punishment  these angry Passions which make them the Disturbers of others By giving them up to the Workings of these he opens a Source of restless Pain within their Breasts and delivers them over to themselves to be their own  Tormentors  In thus  connecting  the Punishment with the Crime causing their  own wickedness to reprove them and their backslidings to correct them  the Hand of Justice is plainly seen And tho' the Sinner that  feels  it may affect to disguise his Suffering yet every one knows that no Punishment is more  real  or more  intense  than the  inward Misery  of a Mind wrought and torn with Despite Revenge or wrathful Passion In such a Case we may understand that Saying  of the Psalmist to receive its Accomplishment  The wicked have drawn out their sword and bent their bow to cast down the poor and needybut the sword which they have drawn shall enter into their own heart  Pasl xxxvii  The  wrath of man  praises also the Divine Justice by being the  Instrutment  of punishing  other  ambitious and violent Men They are let loose upon one another to fulfil the Vengeance of Heaven One corrupt Nation is raised up against another that  both  may suffer for their Sins And as there can be no soild nor lasting Bond of Union amongst wicked Men tho' they may be occasionally cemented by Conspiracy against the Good their continually interfering Views and Interests render them in the just  Judgment  of Providence a Prey to mutual Jealousy Strife and FraudFinally the Justice of GOD is praised in the  Vengeance  which sooner or later he executes against the Wrath and Violence of Sinners They may go on for a Time and appear to prosper The Justice of Heaven may seem to slumber but it is  awake  and only waits till the  measure of their iniquity be full  How oft has the World been awakened to the Observation of the awful Government  of GOD by the sudden Fall and Destruction of Tyrants GOD represents himself in Scripture as permitting Wickedness sometimes to arise to an overgrown Height on Purpose that its Ruin may be the  greater  and the more  astonishing For this cause  he tells that wicked Prince  Pharaoh he had raised him up  that is allowed him to prosper and be exalted  that he might shew in him his power and that his name might be declared throughout all the earth  Exod ix  The Divine Administration is glorified as well in the  strange Punishment  he hath decreed for the Workers of Iniquity as in the  Reward  he hath prepared for the Righteous This is  the purpose which the Lord hath purposed upon all the earth and this is the hand that stretched forth over all the nations  Isa xiv    THUS the  wrath of man  is made to  praise God  by giving Mankind  deep Impressions  of that infinite  Power Wisdom  and  Justice  that governs the World Such Impressions it is necessary for Mankind to have and in their present imperfect State they can only receive them from something that is  sensible  and  striking  The Commotions and Disorders of the World  open a Field for  signalizing  the Divine Administration more than if all Things went on in a  quiet undisturbed  Tenor The Waters must be sometimes  troubled  that we may  attend  to that Hand which stills their Raging and  Clouds  must arise that the heavenly Light which dispels them may  strike  our Eye with the more sensible  Brightness  We further observed  II THAT the  wrath of man  may be justly said to praise GOD by that Tendency which he gives it to  improve  and  illustrate  the  Virtues  of good Men and thereby to  beautify  his Church and People Now it hath this Effect  As it is employed by GOD to be the Means of  correcting  good Men for their Faults These  Storms  which Ambition and Pride raise among Mankind he permits with the same Intention that he sends forth  Tempests  and  Hurricanes  amongst the Elements to clear the Atmosphere of noxious Vapours and purify it from that  Corruption  which all Things contract by too much Rest Bad Men appear sometimes to have obtained entire Power over the Just they exercise their Tyranny perhaps with a very heavy and oppressive  Hand the Just complain and groan and in the Bitterness of their Soul can hardly forbear to exclaim "  Where  is the Lord And where the  Sceptre  of  Righteousness  and  Truth Hath God forgotten to be gracious  Or doth he indeed  see  and  is there knowledge in the Most High  "Their Oppressors are really no more than the Instruments of GOD to them for  Good  He sees they stand in  Need  of such Correction and therefore raises them up Enemies to cure the Intemperance of Prosperity And by that Seriousness which Affliction is fitted to introduce into the Mind to lead them to think of themselves of their Duty and their past Errors In this Way the Disturbers of the Earth are often represented to us in Scripture as  Scourges  in the Hand of GOD sent forth to do his Work upon a degenerating People They are employed in the Execution of righteous and wise Purposes  concealed  from themselves and when their Commission is fulfilled recalled and destroyed Of this we have a remarkable Example in the King of  Assyria I will send him says  GOD  against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey  howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a fewWherefore it shall come to pass that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looks  Isa x  Vainly then doth the  warth of man  lift itself up against GOD  Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith Or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it  Isa x    All things  whether they will or not must  work together for good to them that love God  This amongst the rest fills up the Place assign'd it by the  Ordination  of Heavenand the proudest Conqueror and the most oppressive Tyrant possess only the same  Station  with the Famine the Pestilence and the Flood their  Triumphs  are no more than the Accomplishment of GOD's Correction And  the remainder of their wrath shall he restrain  GOD makes the  wrath of man  to praise him not only by employing it in Chastisement but as the Instrument of  improving  and  signalizing  the Graces of good Men and  thereby raising them to higher  Honour  and  Glory  Had there been no Persecutors and Tyrants no Oppressors of Liberty no wrathful and furious Men in the World what a Number of  great  and  worthy  Actions had never been heard of What shining Examples of Fortitude Constancy and Patience had been lost to the World What a Field of Virtues  peculiar  to a State of Improvement and Discipline had lain uncultivatedSpirits of a higher Order possess a State of  established  Virtue that stands in Need of no such  Improvements  and  Trials  But to  us  who are only under Education for such a State it  belongs  to pass through the Furnace that our Souls may be  tried refined  and  brightened  We must stand the  Conflict  that we may be graced and crowned as  Conquerors  The  wrath of man  gives the Occasion and the Fieldcalls us forth to the most conspicuous and distinguished Exercise of  active  Virtueand forms us to all those  suffering  Graces which are amongst the brightest Ornaments of the human Soul When unjust Attempts are carried on against our publick Interests these give us the Means of discovering true publick Spirit and Love to our Country When we suffer in our private Concerns  there our Enemies put it into our Power to gain the noblest Conquest by overcoming the World and to make ourselves greater than the greatest Man who injures us by forgiving him When we suffer for the Sake of Truth and a good Conscience there we have the desirable Opportunity afforded us of gaining Honour truly immortal by being Witnesses for GOD and maintaining an exemplary and heroic Fidelity In all this  the wrath of man praises God  Every single Instance in which our Souls are improv'd or some Action of distinguished Goodness is produced by Means of  the wrath of man  redounds most highly both to our  own Good  and to  his Praise  who hath  order'd  Things in this Manner for our  Improvement  'Tis thus the illustrious Band of Patriots and Heroes of Confessors and Martyrs have been set forth to the Admiration of all Ages as  the lights of the world  Whilst the Violence and Fury of Enemies instead of bearing them down has only serv'd to exalt and dignify them the moreWe proceed now to the  III VIEW we proposed to give of the  wrath of man praising God  when Providence makes  it the Mean of  working  out greater  Prosperity  and  Happiness  upon the whole to his People and ChurchI say the Violence of  Enemies  the Rage of  Persecutors  and the Oppression of  Tyrants  not only tend in the Way of moral and religious Improvement to the  bettering  of our Souls but also are often made in their Consequences to produce other unlook'd for Blessings to good Men  in this State  As this is no rare nor unfrequent Thing we shall point out some Instances in which it appears Thus  THE Hardships which good Men suffer from others in their  private  Concerns are often seen to  give Birth  to their succeeding Prosperity Many Exemplifications of this we find in History The unfortunate Circumstances of  Moses's  Birth thro' the Cruelty of an  Egyptian  Tyrant were the Means of this exposed Infant's being bred up as a King's Son and of his being  accomplish'd  for his future great Atchievements with all the Wisdom and Learning of the  Egyptian  Court The Insolence and proud Resentment of  Haman  pav'd the Way for the Advancement of  Mordecai  his Enemy at the very critical Time When he thought his Designs ripe for sinking  him into Ruin And his cruel Scheme for the Destruction of  Mordecai  's whole Nation prov'd the Occasion of their being raised above  all  their Enemies  There are many devices in the heart of a man but the counsel of the Lord shall stand  Prov xix  He  connecting  together each Link in the Chain of Events that fill up our Life by an unexpected  Contexture  of Causes makes those Things which we most deplore  bring on  our better Days And in the dark Bosom of Misfortune gradually  ripens  the latent Seeds of future ProsperityHow frequently have the Attempts of Enemies to run down and  blacken  good Men by all the Arts of Malice made their Character shine the  fairer  in the Eye of the impartial World How frequently have the  Extremities  to which they have been driven by Injustice and Violence prov'd the Occasion of calling forth their  Courage  and  Activity  and of putting them upon such  Efforts  to do themselves Justice as have raised them higher than ever they fell How many in the Course of their Life have had Reason to be  thankful  for being disappointed by the Wrath of their Enemies in Designs which perhaps they very  earnestly  pursued but which if they had  succcessfully  accomplish'd they have afterwards seen would have prov'd their  Ruin Whoso is wise and will observe these things even he shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord  Psal cvii    BUT if thus in  private  Life the  wrath of man  is often made to praise GOD by becoming the Occasion of greater Good still more is the Hand of GOD apparent in the Ends of  publick Benefit  it is made to serve to  Nations  and  Societies  The Rage of Civil Wars the Oppression of Tyrants and all the other dismal Effects of the Ambition and Wrath of Man have often sung the Praise of GOD to many succeeding Generations Thence have been made to spring publick  Liberty  to a People wise  Government  good  Order  and lasting  Peace  Nations have been thereby awaken'd to see their  true Interests  and taught more effectually to  secure  them Publick Affairs being once thrown into a  Ferment  the Corruptions of Government like bad Humours in the Body have been purg'd and wrought off The Feeling of grievous Oppression has frequently been the first Thing that made Nations  shake off  the  Yoke  and  led them to assert their own  just Rights  against tyrannical Governors  which  had their Tyranny been less insolent these Nations would have remain'd longer perhaps for ever  depriv'd of  Of this we have a memorable Example in the late glorious and happy  Revolution  in our own Country Our Constitution and its Liberties might have been  insensibly undermined  and  ruined  had it not been for the glaring and open Violation of Laws with a high Hand which proclaiming all to be  then  at Stake rouz'd up the Spirits of Men to rnake a determin'd Stand against incroaching  Tyranny  and thus gave Birth to that  free  and  legal Establishment  with which we at this Day are blessed and for which we hope late Posterity after us shall continue to bless the Providence of GOD Had it not been for the  avow'd  Attempts then made against our Religion and our fundamental Rights  Britain  might have been now under a  Popish  Sovereign and instead of that mild and temperate Administration we have enjoyed under a Series of Princes who have always made the Law their Rule we would have been the Subjects or rather  Slaves  of those who arrogantly claim us as their  Property  by  Divine  Right  In like Manner the Tyranny and Violence of  Tarquin  produced the illustrious and victorious Commonwealth of  Rome  The Oppression of the King of  Spain  laid the Foundation of the Liberty of the  United Provinces  and Liberty from a few inconsiderable Fishertowns has raised them to the most flourishing Height of Trade and Opulence As to the first  Establishment  of Freedom so to the further  Security  of a publick Interest unjust and violent Designs have been often subservient Attempts to  overthrow  a good Government have generally  strengthned  it more By these its false Friends are  unmasked  and brought to Light its secret Foes suffer for their Treachery the  Zeal  of its Wellwishers is awakened and increased and from what is felt of the  Violence  and  Outrage  of its Enemies People are more confirm'd in  Abhorrence  of their Designs and made more justly to prize the Blessings of  Tranquillity  and  legal Protection  FURTHER the  wrath of man  in the  Persecution  of  Religion  and  Truth  signally praises GOD when it is made to turn to the greater  Advancement  of Religion and further Propagation of TruthThe Church of GOD since  the Days of its Infancy hath never been free from the World's Wrath and yet in these Ages in which it was most  persecuted  it hath most  flourished  In vain the Policy and the Rage of the World united their Strength to extinguish this Divine Light Tho' all the four Winds blew against it it only shone the brighter and flam'd the higher  Many waters could not quench it nor all the floods drown it  and the Blood of the Martyrs as has been often and justly said was the Seed of the Church The  Zeal  of the primitive Christians their  Constancy  and  Fortitude  in giving Testimony to Truth and their chearful  Patience  in suffering for it did much more to  increase  the Number of Converts to true Religion than all the  Terror  and  Cruelty  of Persecutors could ever do to  lessen  it The Attempts that were used to bear down Religion only enlarg'd its Triumphs by displaying the victorious Force of Truth By this Means the  wrath of man  was made to turn  against itself  to the Destruction of its own Purpose like Waves that assaulting a Rock with impotent Fury discover its immoveable Stability whilst they dash themselves in Pieces at its Feet Prosperity Greatness and worldly  Favour may have corrupted Religion and sullied the Purity of the Church But never did the  wrath of man  try to overthrow it but in the Issue it made its own Weakness appear and rais'd the  praise of God  by purifying the Church and advancing Religion more  I SHALL only add one Instance more of the  wrath of man  praising GOD by accomplishing Ends of most extensive Benefit and that is  the Death of  JESUS CHRISTNever did Malice Rage and Envy please themselves with the Thoughts of having obtain'd a more complete Triumph than in this Case JESUS was now put to Death the Revenge of his Enemies gratified his Name and his Honour they believ'd rooted out from amongst Menyet behold how vain the  wrath of man  is all that they intended to  overthrow  they most effectually  confirm'd  The  Ignominy  of the Cross became the Standard of  eternal Honour  to CHRIST and his Religion and his  Death  perpetrated by them as a wicked Murder was in the Counsel of GOD the Spring of  everlasting Life  to all his Followers He who  restrains the Remainder of Wrath  at his Pleasure suffer'd their Rage to suggest no  other  Things to them  than what himself had long before determin'd and his Prophets foretold should be so done So that they all  conspir'd  to render the whole most exactly conformable to his  original Plan  of Mercy and Goodness and each contributed his  Share  to finish that great Work which none of them  knew  any thing of nor in the least  intended  So  glorious  an Instance as this fully  ascertain'd  and laid out to us in Scripture of the  wrath of man  ministring to the gracious Designs of Heaven ought to have the greatest Weight as an  Exemplification  of the Conduct of Providence in many  other Cases  where we have not so much Light afforded us for the Discovery of its Ways  AND now by this Induction of Particulars you see upon the whole how much Ground there is for asserting that the  wrath of man shall praise God  that all the Disorders which the Passion and Pride of Men occasion in the World tho' they take their first  Rise  from the Corruption of human Nature are so  order'd  as to become Parts of a wise and good Constitution redounding to his Honour and Glory who hath order'd allEither illustrating before the World his  Divine Perfections  in the Government of Thingsor serving the Purposes of  moral  and  religious Improvement  to the Souls of Menor by some secret Tendency  working out Prosperity and Happiness  to those whom they seem most to threaten with Suffering and Evil  Surely O GOD the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain  "In thy Hand it is and thou never lets it forth but in  Weight  and  Measure  It is  wild  and  intractable  in its Nature but thou  tamest  it  blind  and  headlong  in its Impulse but thou  directest  it ever  struggling  to break its Chain knowing no Bounds but thou  confinest  it Thou  retrenchest  all the  Superfluity of its Fury"  Let us now consider what is the Improvement to be made of this Meditation on the Ways of Providence  Let it lead us to a religious Contemplation of the  Hand of God  in all the Occurrences and Transactions of the World We behold a very mixed and busy Scene of Things passing before us the Passions of Men variously agitated and new Changes daily brought forth upon this Stage of Time We behold Peace and War taking their Turns the  Fortunes of private Men rising and falling and Nations and Kingdoms partaking in the same Fluctuation and Vicissitude In all this if we look no farther than to the Operation of external Causes and the mere Rotation of Events we behold only the dead Side of Nature stop at the Surface of Things contemplate them not like rational and religious Beings The  Life  and  Beauty  of the Universe arises from the View of that Wisdom and Goodness which  animates  and  conducts  the whole and  unites  all the Parts in one great Design There is an eternal Mind that puts all these Wheels in Motion himself remaining for ever at Rest Of him we are to conceive not as removed from this World sitting a mere Spectator of his Creatures in his high Abode but as an omnipresent Spirit  pervading directing  and  regulating  all ever busy without  Toil  and working without  Weariness  Nothing is void of him even in the Passions and Ragings of Men GOD is to be found and when they think they guide themselves his Hand controuls and guides them stillTo what serious and solemn Thoughts are we led by such a View as this when we attend not merely to the Actings of  Men but to the Ways of GOD deeply impress'd with the Belief that we and all our Concerns are Parts of his great Administration  FROM what has been said we see that we ought not to be shaken in our Minds by any present  seeming Disorders  of the World so as on Account of them to think ill of Providence Many Things doubtless there are which appear as  Blemishes  in the general Order to a superficial View and which if we were to regulate the World we think should have  no Place  in it And yet these various Instances which we  see  and can clearly  trace  of the Workings of Passion and Wickedness render'd subservient to worthy and good Ends give us the highest Reason to conclude that in all other Cases of seeming Evil the like Ends are promoted This ought to satisfy our Minds even where the Prospect is most  discouraging  and the State of human Affairs most  dark  and  embroil'd  The Schemes of Divine Wisdom are too  large  and  comprehensive  to be discerned by us in all their Extent at one View and where we see only by  Parts  we must be often at a Loss to judge of the  Whole The way of God is in the sea and  his path in the great waters his footsteps are not known  Psal lxxvii  Although thou sayest thou canst not see him yet judgment is still before him therefore trust thou in him  Job xxxv  His it is to educe Good from Ill Order from Confuision his own just Praise from Man's Wrath As in the natural World there is no  real  Deformity nothing but what has either its own Ornament or Use so the most irregular and deformed  Appearances  in the moral World shall be made to  heighten  the Beauty of the whole And in the End  all  the Works of GOD shall appear to be perfect GOD  binds  together the most opposite and disagreeing Principles in the Laws of universal  Concord  and  adapts  even the most harsh and discordant Notes to the  Harmony  of his Goodness As he hath rear'd the goodly Frame of Nature from  various  and  jarring  Elements and hath settled it in Peace so he hath formed such an  Union  by his Providence of the  more various  Interests and  more jarring  Passions of Men that they all  conspire  to his Glory and  cooperate  for the general GoodHow amazing is that Wisdom which comprehends such infinite  Diversities  and  Contrarieties  within  its Scheme How powerful that Hand which  bends  to its own Purpose the Good and the Bad the Busy and the Idle the Friends and the Foes of GOD which makes them  all  hold on their Course to his Glory tho'  divided from one another  by a Multiplicity of Pursuits and  differing  often  from themselves  and whilst they all move themselves at their  own Freedom  yet by a secret Influence winds and turns them at  his Will O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out  Rom xi    From what has been said we see the greatest Reason for  entire Submission  to the Will of Heaven amidst all Sufferings from the  Wrath  and Violence of Men These befal us not  in vain  they are not to be considered as mere Effects of the arbitrary  Pleasure  and  Will of Men  nor are we to believe ourselves the  Sport  of  Fortune  and  Passion  But good Designs are  going on  GOD is always carrying forward his  own Ends  And if we are certainly assured that all is tending to  his Glory  which is ever the same with the  general Good  is not this a sufficient Reason for  the most peaceable  Acquiescence  on our Part Ought not we as  Parts  of the  Whole  chearfully to resign our  private  Interest to the Advancement of a  higher  and more  general Good  But moreover by this Resignation our  own Interest  shall suffer nothing in the Issue For the greatest Happiness of  every  good Man of  each Individual  as well as of  the whole  is comprehended in that  Praise  which the  wrath of man  is decreed to yield to GOD Hence ought to arise not unreluctant  Submission  only but the most exalted  Joy  in the Divine Administration to all who are pious and virtuous In  all Events  their Interest is secur'd and the severest Trials of Life are to them Matter even of  Thankfulness  and  Gratitude  when view'd in their just Light For in these very Trials their Advantage is  consulted  by them is their Good  promoted  and the most hurtful Designs of the Wrath of Man are  converted  into  Benefits  and  Blessings  Let this be enough to reconcile our Minds to every Part of our Lot and to establish them in the most comforting  Trust  and  Confidence  in GOD in the Way of our Duty  If God be for us who  or what  can be against us  He who can defeat all the Purposes of our  Enemies  and transform their  intended Evil  unto  real Good  is certainly the most powerful  Friend  And if  his Wrath  be once appeas'd there is no  other Wrath  from which we have ought to fear  FROM all that has been said of the Conduct of Providence let us observe how much Reason there is for acknowledging with Thankfulness the Hand of GOD in all these  Deliverances  which we obtain from the  wrath of man  As we ought never to forget when we suffer by human Violence that it is his Hand which  corrects  us so when that Violence receives a Check we ought to remember it is his Hand which  restrains  it In  both  these the  wrath of man  either  permitted  or  restrain'd  praises GOD and we have seen him remarkably prais'd  in both  Through all the Steps of our late  Sufferings  and our present happy  Deliverance  such a  Series  of Divine Wisdom hath appear'd as must present to the Observation of every  considering  Spectator a very  beautiful Scene  in the History of Providence GOD beheld a Nation whom he had favoured with long Tranquillity and Peace sunk by that Peace and Tranquillity into  Luxury  and  Corruption of Manners  He had bless'd  them with a happy Constitution a mild Government and equal Laws but long Enjoyment had  deaden'd  their  Sense  of so invaluable a Blessing and fed a  giddy  and  factious Spirit  He had distinguish'd them with the purest Enjoyment of pure Religion above most Nations of the Earth but their religious Privileges  once  struggled for with Zeal began to be  contemn'd  and their  first Love to cool  Behold how  opportunely  GOD sent forth the  wrath of man  to work a Cure for all these Evilsto shake  that Peace  which had fostered  Luxury  and  Impiety  under its Wings to threaten  that Religion  and  that Government  to the Blessings of which we had beeninsensible and to display before us these Terrors of  oppressive Power  and  persecuting Religion  to the Danger of which we had been laid asleepHe made us  feel  the Value of all we should have losthe made the Evil to grow  sudden  and  unexpected  from amongst ourselves and allowing it to proceed so far as might be sufficient to  awaken  the Nation and to render us  serious  and  wise  he then gave a signal Check to the  wrath of man  and  restrain'd the remainder of it  after it had gone the Length which he saw meet Our Enemies boasted  of the  Favour  and  Countenance  of Heaven  Countenanced  they were by Heaven but not for their  own Sakes  and the Success permitted them for a Time was meant for the  Improvement  and  Benefit  of  those  whom they intended to  destroy  When the proper  Season  was come for GOD to assert his own Cause then he rais'd up an illustrious  Deliverer  whom for a Blessing to his Country he had prepared against this  Time of Need  HIM he crowned with the Graces of his  Righthand  to the conspicuous  Bravery  of early  Youth  he added that  Conduct  and  Wisdom  which in others is the Fruit only of  long Experience  and distinguish'd Him with all those  Qualities  which render the  Man  amiable as well as the HERO Great He sent him forth to be the  Terror  of his Foes the  Confidence  and  Love  of his Friends and in the Day of Danger and Death commanded the  Shields of Angels  to be spread around himWhat Heart in which the Love of BRITISH Liberty remains  warms  not at the Mention of his NameWhose Bosom overflows not with  Gratitude  when he looks back upon the late dark and melancholy Scenes of  Oppression  and  Terror  and surveys the fair Prospect now open'd by this  chosen  Instrument  of our Deliverance of  Peace  restored  Liberty  flourishing and  Religion  safeLet us lift up our Eyes to Heaven and say  This is the doing of the Lord and it is marvellous in our eyes  Psal cxviii  HIM the  wrath of man  hath indeed signally  prais'd  in our Land  Prais'd  him when it rag'd and  prais'd  him when it fell  When he arose his enemies were scattered as smoke is driven away and as chaff before the windGive unto the Lord ye mighty give unto the Lord glory and strength  Psal xxix    He breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in fire  Psal xlvi    His excellency is over Israel his strength is in the clouds He giveth strength and victory to his people  Psal lxviii  PRAISE  ye the  LORD  The END
