 MEMOIRS OF T WILKINSON  VOL IV  MEMOIRS OF HIS OWN LIFE BY TATE WILKINSON  PATENTEE OF THE THEATRESROYAL YORK HULL  IN FOUR VOLUMES  IF I HAD HELD MY PEN BUT HALF AS WELL AS I HAVE HELD MY BOTTLEWHAT A CHARMING HAND I SHOULD HAVE WROTE BY THIS TIME  VOL IV  YORK  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR By WILSON SPENCE and MAWMAN And sold by G G J and J ROBINSON PaternosterRow And T and J EGERTON Whitehall London  Anno    MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON  I HAVE been told I could prevent riotous proceedingsBut I must beg leave to observe that theatrical opinions are so variable unsettled and prejudiced that I fear my reasons will have as little effect as if I were to entreat that all methodists would follow the playhouse or that methodists could persuade all play attendants to become devotees at the tabernacle  The good government that prevails in general at Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres is owing to uniformity decorum begets decorum Consequently the strict order to be found in the London audiences does not owe its happy preservation entirely to three or four constables in waiting or to ten or twelve of the King's guards  Witness the great riot on the Chinese Festival at Drury Lane in spite of the sanction of his Majesty King George the Second who was there in person  Another instanceWhen the French actors were to have performed at the Haymarket theatre Justice Du  eil attended by constables and reinforced with the King's guards were defeated by numbers and determined phrenzy then truly might overcame right  Nay yearly at Christmas holidays in London on retrospection the plays are indistinctly and with difficulty got through  On an uproar when Lady Coventry and several other persons of quality were obliged to quit the stagebox on account of a supposed affront given to Miss Bellamy in Juliet it was the audience and not any other force compelled those disturbers to leave the theatre  In when Captain Smith of the guards gave offence on the first night Mr Murphy appeared in Jaffier and only his second character on the stage it was the general voice that would not permit the play to pro  d till the cause of interruption was re  oved  At York formerly on a Shrove Tuesday merely from a savage custom the upper gallery was so noisy from num ers that it could not be conquered but by raising the price on that night and  which has by the experiment in a great measure removed the evil  I beg leave to be here understood as speaking of theatres in general but when the propriety of London is singled out let it be well recollected that  the audiences there preserve their own respect  for the instant the curtain draws up all noise subsides and every person sits down nor will they  uffer the actors to proceed if a hat remains on a head but in most country theatres when the performance begins the vgazers in the galleries stand up and with their hats on nay hats are too often seen on in the pit  If at London a rioter is vociferous in the gallery they are from custom and good regulation so habituated to order and necessary attention that the offender is by  universal  consent delivered over to the constables who not only conducts the culprit out of the gallery but if guilty of throwing bottles c on the stage or into the pit or boxes he is conveyed before a justice to be properly punished A disturbance there even of a short duration seldom happens in the pit for the instant of interruption the person is removed by force and turned out with disgrace and ignominy  To repeat more as to myself concerning the winter at Edinburgh in would not only be fulsome and impertinent but is far from being  necessary nor would it be entertaining I acted a variety of characters and suffice it to say I was well received and met with great civilities and indulgences Richard Bayes and Foote's pieces were repeated My first benefit on Friday March was a fine house Alexander was revived with a triumph c at the managers' expence and a farce written by Mr Chaigneau of Dublin called Harlequin Soldier taken from the French My second benefit was the last night in the season Saturday April another play never acted there called Coriolanus with a new burlesque farce in two acts wrote by Dr Schombergh of Bath called Bucephalus The play pleased muchthe farce not at allthough after playing Coriolanus I produced myself as Princess Statira In a few days I engaged to proceed with the managers and company to Glasgow where my bargain was chiefly dependent on two clear benefits and full of hopes that a second fire would not be wickedly put into practice or even attempted as had been the year before Most of the same plays acted at Edinburgh were ready and repeated at Glasgow My first benefit was upwards of l The play was Henry the Fourth Falstaff Mr Lancaster Prince of Wales Mr Aickin Hotspur Mr Wilkinson The farce I have forgotLancaster was a great favourite at Edinburgh  My second benefit was only lThe Play was Essex Essex Mr Wilkinson with Tragedy AlaMode c  The sensible the friendly the spirited and th  vivacious Mr Sinclair of whom York boasts as an honourable acquisition to its inhabitants was that year at Glasgow college I have had the pleasure of hearing him declare the first play he ever saw acted was the night I appeared in the difficult character of King Lear at the Glasgow theatre and whether the performance was superexcellent or the contrary is not for me to determine But I dare affirm being the first impression made on his youthful mind that he was highly delighted and will never forget Wilkinson's Lear let any actor's merit how great soever interfere on his sight and more enlightened judgment  I do not recollect any circumstance worth relating in that trip to Glasgow except my having the pleasure of being on a degree of intimacy with the worthy Mr John Moore known better by being called the good  Johnny Moore  he was a gentleman very extraordinary to say that every body loved and respected At his house I was often most agreeably entertained and particularly whenever Mr Nicholson Stewart and others paid him a visit and came on a trip to se  the play from Edinburgh That said good character Mr  Moore is mentioned not only by Mrs Bellamy but also by Doctor Smollet in his novel of Humphrey Clinker all praised and loved him and surely what every one said must be true I returned from Glasgow to Newcastle where my old friend Mr Baker manager of the York company was stationed at the races at that town It was their usual yearly service at that time for the summer season till York meeting the latter end of August  I acted Cadwalladar on the Saturday in the Newcastle raceweek and Major Sturgeon the Monday followingI had indeed been secretly engaged by Mr Baker for Newcastle where I had never played till that time before my departure from Glasgow I continued at Newcastle to the finishing of the season in August at Mr Parker's the Turk'sHead in the Big Market which house Mr Baker for many years made his constant place of residence All went smoothly onwe had a good raceweek a good assizeweek and several very good benefitsSir Francis Delaval cam  down that summer from the south to his seat of Seaton Delaval built as I have been told under Sir John Vanbrugh's directionMr David Ross came there at the same time by the invitation of Sir FrancisSir John now Lord Delaval and his Lady were there also Thomas Delaval  Esq  the younger brother and sorry am I to add wha  is well known that when Sir Francis died I lost a valuable and honourable friend the younger brother is also dead So that with engagements at Sir Francis Delaval's many invitations at Newcastle where they are particularly hospitable my time passed agreeably and profitably I set myself a hard task preparatory to my own benefit which was to finish the season by getting up Mr Macklin's favourite farce of Love AlaMode With patience and assiduity it was a possible work and promised much credit and cashTo tell the truth I had by luck obtained the parts by the following methodThe part of Sir Archy I had to prepare myself in Mr Garrick sent it to me at Winchester in the year Squire Groom from my friend Ned Shuter Mordecai from Mr Creswick who had acted the part at Covent Garden the lady's part from Mrs Burden's copy who played it at the same theatre So I had only to make the Irish character of Sir Callaghan which by the frequency of seeing the farce and the help of the first act being printed in a magazine made it with a little trouble more than half ready to my hands Sir Theodore a part from remembrance the rest of my own manufacture  Mr Macklin it is true was justifiably angry but mine for his credit was better acted and  more like his farce than the stuff given in every country town with pur  oined lines only And Mr Shylock to me proved himself no Jew but a friend and a good Christian he forgot and forgave and occasionally favoured me with his permission to act the farce of Love AlaMode though he after jokingly called me a great rogue I could not but allow the justice of his accusation I have often invited him to visit York but he was always better pleased by my visiting him and accepting his cheer goodwill and kindness than trying the experiment of my Yorkshire board  I concluded at Newcastle with Love AlaMode As the farce was got up with the care and the austerity almost of Mr Macklin himself had he been the inspector it was received with an universal effect almost equal to a London representation when that piece was in its highest estimationAt Newcastle it was cast as follows Sir Archy Mr Wilkinson Sir Callaghan Mr Frodsham Squire Groom Mr Creswick c A crowded house and from the flattering reception it was honoured with at that town and indeed from the compliments I received there at that time my vanity suggested I should be a lasting favourite though I aftewards experienced a contrary  temper like the saying of friends who are soon hot and as soon cold  The York races which in the year were in their great glory made me imagine Love AlaMode would prove of the highest consequence thereGood old Mr Baker said he could not be happy unless his adopted son Tate Wilkinson would oblige him by being at York that raceweek and he really treated me as a son with one fault attending a partial father which was  "All I did was right"  Mr Baker's liberality I had not the least occasion to doubt and if without any emolument whatever my services could have pleased or served so worthy and kind a friend they were sincerely at his commandWe came as father and son to his house atYork where in fact I was the  major  omo  and I  aid to I by itself I  I  should do great things at the theatre from Love AlaMode which would go down more pleasantly than my tea which they had not approved and expected to be applauded as a Garrick a Foote and a Macklin in the different characters And here good reader you will observe a lesson for vanity and as efficacious and as good a cure as are Spilsbury's drops for the scurvy or Godbold's for a consumptionI was so assured of success with Love AlaMode c though when in May I had not thought of ever visiting York  again notwithstanding I had left that city in tolerable favour that tripand mark good reader that to Love AlaModethereby hangs a tale and eventful history  The Monday in the race week I fixed on Cadwallader in the farce as a part I was certain the York audience were partial to me in and judged I was established in their opinions That year was the second of the new theatre When at rehearsal that noon a message was sent to me while on the stage that several gentlemen desired to speak with me in Mr Baker's diningroom I instantly obeyed the summons first desiring the performers to wait and in imagination assuring myself it must certainly be a complimentary intended bespoke play for my performing in some shining character the night following When I made my entrance into the room in high mirth and glee where the gentlemen were and was singing aloud  York races are just now beginning  The lads and their  uses are coming  after my bow and on the survey of features not recolle  ing one individual face there assembled I naturally requested to be acquainted with the honour of their comman is as I was at that time busily engaged with my attention to the rehearsal  of the Author a farce of Mr Foote's which was intended for that very evening when a young gentleman quickly replied  "Sir it is that very rehearsal and farce I came to put an immediate stop to"  then turning to Mr Baker said  "Sir you need not be informed the York theatre is not licensed and if you are not acquainted with another circumstance I beg you will understand you are guilty of a double offence by a flagrant breach of law and flying in the face of authority as the impudent libel called the Author written by that scoundrel Foote was stopped from any future performance six years ago in December and has not been permitted sinceMy name Mr Wilkinson is Aprice and the character of Cadwallader you mean to perform is an affront to the memory of my father who is now dead As his son by Gd I will not suffer such insolence to pa  s either unnoticed or unpunishedtherefore if at night you dare attempt or presume to play that farce myself and friends are determined one and all not to leave a bench or scene in your theatre so Mr Wilkinson your immediate and determinate answer"  I could only reply refer to Mr Baker who was the manager and the proprietor I was only on an engagement with that gentleman for the race week and I should be guided by his opinion  and direction  "Well Mr Baker" said Mr Aprice "we wait your decision"  The old gentleman spoke thus  "Why look ye d'ye see gentlemen if so be that is the case why as to the matter of that Mr Wilkinson d'ye see me must not act Cadwallader this evening"  That Mr Aprice said was all he requested and added that himself and friends would all attend the theatre that night but expected no infringement to be made on the treaty either by secret or offensive means to cause an opposition after the manager's word was given then wished a good race week and Aprice and his numerous association departed  For some minutes Mr Baker and I stood and gazed at each other like Gayless and Sharp after Kitty Pry's departurewhere one says  "O Sharp Sharp"  the other answers  "O master master"  But when recovered a little from the dilemma what was to be done that was the questionTo be or not to be for I could not advance forward the Author being a favourite farce and say  "A party of gentlemen would not suffer it to be acted for if it was t  ey threatened a dangerous riot"    or could we give out handbills and inform the public a performer was dangerously ill who might immediately contradict it and assert his being in perfect health So in  council it was agreed to be naturally stupid say nothing but substitute the Mayor of Garratt and proceed with the farce so changed without any apology whateverIt certainly was the strangest mode that ever was adopted or that ever was suffered without momentous consequences attended with strict inquiring and investigation  The first scene between Sir Jacob Jollup and Mr Lint the apothecary the  astonished  audience sat each staring in his fellow's face like Shakspeare's blacksmith with his hammer up and swallowing a tailor's news and concluded it was something new by Wilkinson foisted into the Author but when I was announced as the Major and made my entrance the reader will not be surprised when informed I was received with an universal hissI took no notice but went onThe disapprobation continued but not so virulently as to occasion a stand still and the reader may be assured we lost no time in getting our work over but wished for bedtime and that all were well for though I owed Heaven a debt it is clearly evident it was not then due and I was like Falstaff loath to pay before the day At last the death of that day's life came on the curtain droppeo and the poor Major Sturgeon sneaked away with marks of anger following at his heels and  unk to bed to cover himself and his dishonour  So ended the first lesson of the week where I expected to have outdone my usual outdoings but the greatest generals have met with disgraces and misfortunes  Tuesday I acted the Lyar which went off wonderfully well I breathed better than in the morning and felt once more a little elated I had fixed on the Apprentice as the entertainment which the summer before had done much for me in London but unfortunately it happened to be a favourite part of Mr Frodsham's who in truth did not play it well but quite the contrary and in that character I  ailed again without a single hand to assist I laboured through a part which in London I had been much flattered by applause in the extreme my imitations were not known in Yorkshire therefore naturally passed without the least effectThe reader will smile at the pleasant week I had promised myself but I fed on thin diet that of hope which I doubted not would give a brilliant and good ending after the bad beginning  Wednesday for my third performance I intended Sir John Brute in the Provoked  ifea favourite part in which I had been honoured with much approbation at Newcastle that summerThe farce was the UpholstererAnd as I had stood remarkably well in Dublin in opposition even to that excellent actor Mr Woodward repeatedly in the  Tonsor I judged my success could not be doubted and indeed I was so like in voice dress and manner it was a moot point which was which but the cracking of nuts were the only tokens of approbation and my  nerves  are irritated at the sound from that hour to the present I was particularly attached to Sir John Brute and think it was not improper for me as a comedian as I had paid the stricte  t attention to Mr Garrick in that part and it might have been termed a lucky performance of mine I had not studied it from my own suggestion but first at the particular desire of Mr  Johnny Moore  of Glasgow  About twelve on the Wednesday when I had finished the rehearsal of the Provoked Wife a deputation of gentlemen were sent as ambassadors from the ladies assembled then at Giordani's concertYork races were then in their high glory Giordani was at that time under the patronage of Lady Bingley who had great sway in that town and county and was really enthusiastically musical she settled l a year on him which annuity he enjoys to this day and will to the end of his life  The gentlemen who came from the rooms informed me and Mr Baker that Lady Bingley and all the ladies assembled sent their compliments th  y wished that night to make a point of visiting the theatre before they went to the rooms in order  to shew every encouragement to the manager but it was with the proviso that so indecent a play as the Provoked Wife which the ladies could not by any means countenance and desired if their protection and patronage was worth consideration might be changed to another comedy but if their request was not complied with they should not on any account enter the theatre as they would not by any means think of setting out so improper a representationHere was another bar against my rise to greatness at York and from that fatal day my favourite part and play was almost exploded and truly to my loss by its being expunged for ladies to the boxes I never by any means could get to that wellwrote entertaining piece though I confess it has its blemishesThe ladies added that as to the farce of the Upholsterer being altered it was very immaterial as very few would continue after the play but go to the roomsMore comfort still for unfortunate Wilkinson  Well the command as it might be termed from the boxes was likely and necessary to be obeyed however mortifying it was to me fresh bills were issuedforth with every necessary information of the play being altered at the universal desire of persons of distinction to Love in a Village in which a lady of inimitable  talents and great musical abilities performed the part of Rosetta She is now in a superior rank of life by being united to a person distinguishable for his indefatigable talents whose understanding has greatly added to the advantage of the commercial interest of the three kingdoms and who is universally respectedIt is almost needless to add the gentleman's name is Palmer Comptroller of the General PostOffice At that time York races were remarkable for attracting the first families not only of that immense county but the kingdom at large and York was then honoured with as many ladies of the first distinction as gentlemenBut O what a falling off is there O woe is me to have seen what I have seen and seeing what I seeThe house was full and the boxes were much crowded and my only care for the evening was to prepare for th  Barberthough most of the ladies and gentlemen would not wait to be SHAVED but to those who did I was not much indebted for the compliment of their attendance as too sure I had Pilgarlick's ill luck again for as to my resemblance of Woodward it did not occur to one in a hundred but it struck the fancy of the million that it was a part that appertained to their favourite Robertson their darling and deservedly so for he was a comedian of true merit But in regard to my playing  the Barber it was not that night fortunate for me that I interfered with the Edwin or the Parsons of York stage on that occasion and my dressing like Woodward I was afterwards informed was in every article of it contrary to the dress of Mr Robertson and as they pinned their faith upon his sleeve why he was right and I was judged wrong in every particular therefore absurd and assuming in Wilkinson to attempt Mr Robertson's part of the Barber he would spoil it and was impudent ignorant and deserved chastisement and I quitted the stage the third night with an universal hiss and general marks of disapprobationIt was to me a week of perplexity and woe not pleasure to so great a man as  I  had fancied myself  The next day I accidentally stepped into a millener's shop where a little elderly lady sat knitting in the corner and without once looking at me on my entrance or if she had she would  not  have known me said  "Well I am sure Nanny you never shall persuade me to go to the play again to see that hunchbacked Barber Give me the Mourning Bride and Mr Frodsham and then there is some sense in it But for that man that Wilkinson as you call him from London pray let him go back and stay there for he is the ugliest man I ever saw in my life and so thought Jenny I  am sure if he was worth his weight in gold he should never  arry a daughter of mine"  Miss Priestley who knew me looked con  ounded and  aid  "My dear aunt you would alter the severe opinion you are delivering to Nanny i  ou were to see Mr Wilkinson in some of his principal characters therefore dear aunt Doughty go some other night and that gentleman will make a convert of you""No that he never will" replied the old la  y hastily "for I shall never bear the si  ht of him again" I turned round to her and said "Dear madam do not be so very hardheartedtry the theatre once more when  I play  and I will exert my best abilities to make  ou amends and deserve your better sentiments"  The old lady stared down dropped the spectacles the knitted garters followed which had busily employed her attention while speaking and without a single word she took to her heels which were nimble and ran away out of the back door into Newstreet I laughed immoderately but with Miss Priestley the odd circumstance had not such a whimsical effect She appeared much hurt and genteelly apologized for Mrs Doughty as not being a competent judge of plays though a worthy woman which indeed was her true character  It is strange to mention requesting an excuse for the being tedious on so trifling and unentertaining a subject the contrary effect my acting the Barber in the Upholsterer had on the same audience at a distant period from this unfortunate week in Mr Woodward late in April played four nights at York and on Saturday the th fixed for his benefit the part of Razor and of course was applauded and approved The season following I acted the Barber and was received  as well  as and pronounced not only like but equal to Woodward which plainly proves the difference of being an established favourite or the contrary and let the reader only ruminate how many actors in London have voices that give a shock and seem discordant to the ear on first reception yet if any one of those performers are blessed with sterling merit without which he will never succeed and the tones become customary to the ears of the audience the very voice which at first gave disgust from custom will in a few years become not only familiar but even agreeable and rejoice the good he  rers on the first distinguishable sound even so distant as from behind the scenes which little hint will be sufficient for a certain preparation to give shouts of welcome and applause not  only from the gods but every part of a charmed and a resounding theatre  I must not forget to mention a very particular circumstance which was the cause of my having related the foregoing accident and shews how strangely things occur Know then reader that in October only three years after Mrs Doughty's unfavourable opinion of me with that said lady's own consent I actually was married to her daughter Jane and have this year still the honour and happiness to call that truly good woman my wife and the Miss Priestley's I am proud to call my cousins  Not having finished the career of that memorable race week I must here register that Fortune had not ceased plaguing me with my performance of the Barber for on the night following Mrs Centlivre's play of the Busy Body was acted Marplot Mr Frodsham to which was added my highlyvalued tower of strength my Ville de Paris called Love AlaModeThundering applause and shouts of expectation had pleasingly disturbed my sleep the night before with glorious vast ideas such as expecting thanks and being the topic of admiring conversation for the  favour  Mr Wilkinson had conferred on the town by so good and unexpected a feast as Mr Macklin's Love AlaModeIndeed one material point was gained for the theatre was crowded in every part  The York audience then were particularly lukewarm as to applause when compared to any other established theatre for Mr Woodward was so hurt the first night he acted at his reception that I was under the necessity of calling on all my acquaintance the next day to assure them Mr Woodward was so chagrined by their coolne  s as to reception and expressing admiration he could not act so well as if on the London Dublin or Edinburgh stagesThey took the hint an  the next night he acted Bobadil and the Apprentice and from the different mode was so surprised and elated that he sat up till past two after all his fatigue aged in the highest spirits But that serenity is now altered as if the children of another soil and that sometimes even to the overdoing More than three plaudits however their admiration may be raised in my humble opin  on destro  s their own dignity and three is full sufficient for any performer's greediness beyond enfeebles instead of strengthening the intended effect For though I well know and feel that true applause is the life and soul that gives v  gour to the player and equal pleasure to the au  tors and is the cordial of all cordials the true  ramati  elixir yet when too often repeated from mistaken zeal it becomes faint and the in  ended  compliment sinks into a joke and is rather a sarcastic than an honoured intention to a cool tho' highly entertained observer A man may be wondered at for his swiftness in running a mile which may occasion his trying to run two  swifter still  but in the trial his reputation is lost and the strict wary eyes become weary with looking on the same object so long  But to return to Love AlaMode in which the first scene being merely introductory not any applause could have been extorted from any audience silence and attention was all that could be required and that was granted The scene of the Jew Beau Mordecai followed nextNot a smile as I stood behind the scenes on the very tenter hooks of expectation my vanity attributed that only to the want of a little rousing and my desired appearanceA ratatat at the stage door and now for it says IWhen I entered as Sir Archy scarcely a handMy heart sunk somewhereno matter where I said to myself for comfort assume courage  'Tis not in mortals to command success  I will do moreI will deserve it  I tried and tried but all in vain the scene dragged and grew more and more dull Next came Sir Callaghan whom I was truly glad to see as  it relieved me from a heavy tedious courtship with the lady which did not promise much better successany change I trusted would be for the betterThey gave applause on seeing Frodsham and a few simpering smiles gave me a cheerer and I judged all would be for the better But when I as Sir Archy and he as Sir Callaghan were left to ourselves in the quarrelling scene which is truly well executed by the author and very entertaining instead of peals of laughter which I had assured myself would follow and to my speeches in particular the full assemblage before us seemed as if by magnetism charmed into an evening's napall was hushthey appeared perfectly willing to grant leave for our departurewe ended the act but not with any honours to grace the remembranceand indeed by the turn of faces in the boxes and almost in every other part it was very perceptible the actors or the piece were by no means approved It was plain by its effect how dull it appeared to them and the coo  treatment I met with was sufficiently grating to prevent a possibility of my being good companya striking instance how much depends upon a first night's receptionfor had they by general consent wished to have been pleased laughed and applauded we should have acted better and they would have relished and approved but they were chilled  and disappointed from having expected too much felt chagrined and were slow as to giving the least encouragement and it might truly be termed not Love AlaMode that night but the farce of Cross Purposes I for my own part as an actor never felt so severe a disappointment and wished for the week over as I could then take my leave of York for ever  While the music was playing preparatory to the second act Frodsham flew eagerly to get relief from his fatal and false friend the brandy bottle I was not quite so rash but was contented with sending for a bottle of Madeira of which I took large and eager libations  If thus a man can die  Much bolder with brandy  So I drink off this bumper and now I can stand the test  And my comrades shall see that I die as brave as the best  Thus armed after a tedious music by the inspiration of the invincible spirit of wine I felt bold and sallied forth once more to take the field I had to Frodsham confessed myself disappointed and hurt however submissive resignation to the decrees of the Fates was indispensable and as an honest witness on a trial often gives weight to the jury so did I rest hopes on my Squire Groom's setting  all matters right and I predicted that when the curtain dropped I should be envious of his receiving all the honours and praises that would from the part being so applicable to the week insure good fortune When Squire Groom made his  entrée  in his new dress and  aw  his potificalibus exactly as Mr King had accoutred himself at London when he acted that part why even there my hopes were frustrated for his being dressed as a gentleman who had been riding his own match gave offence instead of being pleasing to the gentlemen of the turf it was sneered at as impertinently taking too great a liberty in the race week to have any freedom of character or even to be permitted to pass at a time when the whole dependence of the theatre rested on the resort of company that attended York racesSquire Cr  om's scene was permitted to get through  ith difficultyat the end of which apparent disgust and we  riness lessened the audience every minute and then vanished all my pleasing prospect of profit and applause from my fancied treasure in possessing the celebrated farce of Love AlaMode and as the people from all parts hastily retired we w  re equally quick in bringing about the catastrophe and were not under much terror or apprehension for the conclusion as none were left except a few harmless gazers that neither  cared for the audience the farce nor the actors but found themselves in the theatre they scarce knew how and as peaceably departed they hardly knew why Now let me speak in my own defence as to my merit in acting the part of Sir Archy First In the Scotch dialect I was very happy having naturally a nice ear and also repeated opportunities of improvement by having resided two winters in ScotlandIn that point I certainly had the advantage even of Mr Macklin yet not too Scotch for an English audience for that may be possible as an actor may pronounce Scotch too well for a London audience and yet that would be exactly right at Edinburgh I could speak Sir Archy without fear at Covent Garden theatre but would not by any means attempt a Scotch character at Edinburgh though I have been much honoured by their partiality but at Newcastle one hundred miles south of Edinburgh I was accounted a good actor as to the dialect and would have seemed still better at York and superior to York again if I acted the part in London as the purity of the language is naturally less understood the more distant from the country than in or on the borders of Scotland and the performers in London not acquainted with Yorkshire substitute the Wiltshire dialect instead of the northern which is  quite opposite but to the London galleries the substitute answers full as well as  ise zure  c fulfils every idea of a Cockney's common comprehension As to my playing the character I was perfect to a letter and knew every other part and had fully comprehended and executed Sir Archy in Mr Macklin's mannerto do which I was competent So the fault I may say as to its being so unfavourably received did not originate entirely from bad acting in short it was no more t  an a chain of illluck that at one time or another in a greater or less degree pervades nearly all who in the catalogue of life's calendar pass for men and I may venture to assert without offence that the public every where at times is a ticklish and dangerous dependence and there is no standing on such reliance with firmness as the soil is but a sandy foundation at the best  I have seen Mr Mossop when in Dublin have a crowded house with his name the only one thought of in the whole playbill yet by the public being there glutted with too many good performers and from the frequency of feasting at the temple of Parnassus they grew surfeited and after that Mr Mossop aided by Mrs Fitzhenry and the wellknown and admired Miss Catly with an additional band all combined have performed to l  Before I had acted the farce of Love AlaMode at York I assured myself it would be called for and draw great houses on the Friday and Saturday following but the theatrical atmosphere continued dark gloomy and tempestuous and I after the storm was over retired to bed where I sulked most part of the following dayI begged to be excused from any duty on the Friday The Maid of the Mill was acted by Mrs Mahon to a full house Mr Robertson performed the Mock Doctor and I had not seen the audience so truly entertained in the course of the week  The Saturday we concluded with the Wonder Felix Mr Frodsham to which I tacked the Minor which was well received and there I got much credit as well as in the Lyar that week and though I loved applause for who does not the medicine came too lateI made my bow the curtain dropped and as I judged for positively the last time with Tate Wilkinson as a performer on that stageBut ah me our resolutions too much resemble April weather and are a mere shadowy mixture of sunshine clouds and showers and what we do determine oft we break  And so and so  as foolish Becky says there ended my York raceweek but not without a scourge for my vanityI inwardly said and solemnly  "Farewell Old York on  thee I turn my back  there is a world elsewhere  "  I might truly say I had undergone a severe penance although I had not lacked plenty of the good things of this world  The York company set off on the Monday for Beverley its usual place of residence at that time for four or five weeks before the Hull seasonMr Baker as he was fully convinced I had no temptation to allure me again into Yorkshire behaved most liberally for my trouble during the raceweek and he wished as I was in the country that I would try a short season at Hull which he augured would answer mutually for our advantage and be much more profitable than at any other time if I made a journey on purpose for Hull onlyMr Baker's arguments were feasible Hull was a new spot and I yielded to the temptation and liked it better as that place had the charms of inticing novelty to allure me  We will here imagine the York company solacing themselves at pleasant Beverley and myself idle sulky and full of chagrin at York ruminating on the late disappointments with all my vain glories tarni  hed and fancied laurels withered  Having des  anted so long on theatrical subjects I apprehend that many persons in Yorkshire whether the old who  ave seen Mr Fredsham  or the young who have heard much of that gentleman will be pleased with a description of him I have therefore in this niche placed him and that the almost surfeited reader after patiently poring over so much playhouse matter may either sit still and proceed with inspecting this poor monument or lay down the book and seek a more pleasing or profitable recreation I shall here give according to my best recollection a concise sketch of the once muchtalkedof and the now almost forgotten Frodsham who was thirty years ago termed the York Garrick  The abilities of that performer were unquestionableHe was naturally a good actor in spite of himself for tho' London improves and matures and is the most enviable theatrical situation yet genius will be found in every rank soil and station Mr Frodsham had a quick genius aided by a liberal education He was son of an ancient family in Cheshire of the town of Frodsham ten miles from Chester being the half way between Wigan and ChesterBut his mind his understanding and superabundant good qualities were all warped and undermined by nocturnal habits which failings unfortunately were supplied by refreshing pulls at the brandybottle in the morning to take off all qualms from the stomach till the certain consequence ensued of being  enfeebled disordered mad dropsical and dead at the age of thiryfiveWith proper cultivation he would have been a good substitute for BarryI do not say that would have done in his latter state but it would have been the case had he encountered London some years before he fell into such poisonous conduct to himself and then he was the idol which the remembrance of was the support of his fame on his latter years' performanceHe was awkward merely from the want of modelling and worse by being told from his drunken inferiors off the stage that all he did was right But had he been caught at a proper time while wild by such a man as Mr Garrick and that Mr G would have really taken pains with him the York hero would have done honour to London In my experience and best observation his Hamlet and Jaffier still better with all his eccentricity I never saw equalled but by Mr Garrick and Mr Barry at that time and of that period I am speaking not of the present day though Mr Kembel's judgment may challenge what I say as besides  his  various excellencies in that character where the play is performed in the third act the execution is not only spirited and possesses great feeling and fire but the manner of conceiving those passage and conveying them to the audience  is superior by Mr Kemble to that of any other actor's whatever in my remembranceBut I am now speaking of an exuberant rude flower of the drama possessed of voice with melody and merit all considered to an eminent degree He had strong feelings and tears at will and had he been a few years under the correction of a London audience and attentive to his good advisers he would in all probability long before this have been in his meridian and at this time a settingsun There is a coarse picture at York in the printshops of which portrait I cannot say the same of more expensive ones for it not only is very like his person attitude c but is what a picture of real worth should beit is a strong conveyance without giving elegance which he by no means ever attained though his admirers allowed him certainly what he had not and the said trifling print does not make him  outré  as to awkwardness but it just conveys him in Frodsham's manner and mode as an actor One of the strongest likenesses I ever was surprised with was when favoured with a sight of Mr Garrick's picture at full length in the character of Richard the Third at Sir Watkin William Wynn's St James'sSquareI turned suddenly round and was actually astonishedfor there I saw my old master just as I had seen him in his lifetime  Mr Powell of London who the stage had cause to lament is the nearest assimilation I can give of Frodsham Mr Powell had the opportunity of strictly observing real artists Garrick and Barry in all their modes and shapes of griefInattentive Frodsham unhappily was his own master and a careless one for though he set himself difficult tasks he only now and then pursued the trump of fame with ardency or alacrity but lagged and never reached the goal though a very little spurring and jockeyship would have made him come in first and won many a theatrical plate The public were so infatuated and indeed he was so superior that he cast all others at a distance in his York situation and the audience too blindly and too partially for his good approved all he did beyond comparison and when in full pride before he wilfully sunk himself I do not think any actor but Garrick would have been liked so well and even Garrick not without some old maids' opinions at a secret cabal where Frodsham would have been voted superior and under the rose appointed the man for the ladies Nor would that decision in favour of Frodsham have been from  lderly ladies only as he had often melted the youthful fair ones of the tenderest moulds whose he  ts have been susceptible whenever Frodsham was the lover It was by no means a fortunate  circumstance for that young gentleman to be so much superior to all the rest of the York company No actors of high degree were at that time ever known those boards to tread nor was he ever more than ten days in London Thus situated at l s per week salary Frodsham had not any opportunity for observation or improvementno infringement was suffered or change of characters Nay so tenacious was old Mr Crisp  An old actor at York  that it was some time I believe before he could be prevailed upon to resign Hamlet to Frodsham and act the ghost Crisp kept Richard Frodsham acted RichmondCrisp Sir John Brute Frodsham merely Colonel Balby Frodsham besides his tragic abilities acted some such parts as Lord Hardy Young Bevil Lord Townly Sir George Airy sung very tolerably and was a very decent Macheath About thirtytwo years ago he obtained a fortnight for holidays which occasioned great lamentations at York for they were certain if Mr Garrick saw Frodsham it would be a woeful day for the York stage He not only was young and vain but selfopinionated to a superabundant degree When in London he left a card at Mr Garrick's house  "Mr Frodsham of York"  with the same ease and facility as if it had  been the first gentleman from Yorkshire Mr Garrick judged this card of a  country stroller  very easy and very extraordinary and from the sample wished to see the York actor who had accordingly admittance the ensuing day and after a slight conversation during which Garrick was astonished at the young man's being so very free and affable particularly on any subject pertaining to Shakspeare's plays c and still with a procrastination that Garrick was not accustomed to or by any means relished a compliance with he delayed every minute expecting that Frodsham would present his petition to be heard and receive his  commendation  from Garrick's eye of favour But this obsequious request not being made Garrick urged present business and presented the York Romeo with an order for the pit desiring him that night to favour him with attendance to see him perform Sir John Brute accompanied with an invitation to breakfast the en  uing morningat the same time asking him  "Pray now have you seen a play since your arrival in London""O yes" quickly answered Mr Frodsham "I saw you play Hamlet two nights ago" to which he added it was his own favourite character"Well" s  ys Garrick "pray now how did you approve  I hope I pleased you"  for that night he had judged his performance a  lucky hitFrodsham replied  "O yes certainly my dear Sir vastly clever in several passages but I cannot so far subjoin mine to the public opinion of London as to say I was equally struck with your whole performance in that part"  I do not conjecture that any actor who spoke to Garrick ever so amazed himGarrick stammered and said  "Whywhy now to be sure now why I suppose you in the countryPray now Mr Frodsham what sort of a place do you act in at York Is it in a room or ridinghouse occasionally fitted up""O no Sir a theatre upon my honour""O sure why my Lord Burlington has said that why willwill you breakfast tomorrow and we will have a trial of skill and Mrs Garrick shall judge between us ha ha ha now I sayGood day Mr York for I must be at the theatre so now pray remember breakfast"  Frodsham promised he would and made his exit And though Garrick himself told me the circumstance and truly laughed then yet I am certain at the time he had been greatly piqued astonished and surprised at so strange a visit from a country ac  or yet wishing to satisfy his curiosity had done it for once at the expence of his pride and dignity The following day arrived the York hero at  Palais Royale  in Southamptonstreet according to appointmentbreakfast finished with Madam  Garrick as good superintendant waiting with impatience and full of various conjectures why the  poor  man from the country did not take courage and prostrate before the foot of majesty humbly requesting a trial engagement c but as Frodsham did not as expected break the ice Garrick did  "Well Mr Frodsham why now well that is I suppose you saw my Brute last nightNow no compliment but tell Mrs Garrick well now was it rightDo you think it would have pleased at York Now speak what you think""O" says Frodsham "certainly certainly and upon my honour without compliment I never was so highly delighted and entertainedit was beyond my comprehension But having seen you play Hamlet first your Sir John Brute exceeded my belief for I have been told Hamlet Mr Garrick is one of your first characters but I must say I flatter myself I play it almost as well for comedy my good Sir is your  forte  But your Brute dn it Mr Garrick your Brute was excellence itself You stood on the stage in the drunken scene flourishing your sword you placed yourself in an attitudeI am sure you saw me in the pit at the same time and with your eyes you seemed to say "Damn it Frodsham did you ever see any thing like that at York Could you do that Frodsham"  and it  is possible that last remark was a just one The latter part of this harangue of Frodsham's possibly went not so glibly down as the tea at breakfast and the ease and familiarity with which it was accompanied and delivered not only surprised but mortified Garrick who expected adulation and the bended knee  Where thrift might follow fawning  Mr Garrick not only loved but eagerly swallowed flattery with a conjurer's avidity with hey pass and be gone and had it daily served up not only by inferiors equals and dependents but by persons of higher rank Therefore to hear a country actor speak slightly  "touching his Lord Hamlet"  was too much to bear and as Sir Archy says  "was vary new"  After much affectation of laughter and seemingly approving all Frodsham had uttered  "Well now hey for a taste of your qualitynow a speech Mr Frodsham from Hamlet and Mrs Garrick "bear a wary eye"  Frodsham with the utmost composure spoke Hamlet's first soliloquy without any idea of fear or terror or indeed allowing Garrick as a tragedian a better Hamlet or superior to himself Garrick all the while darting his fiery eyes into the soul of Frodsham a custom of Garrick's to all  hom he deemed subservient as if he meant to  alarm and convey from those eyes an idea of intelligence to the beholder of his own amazing intellects Garrick certainly possessed most extraordinary powers of eye as they contained not only the fire and austerity he meant to convey but his  mplicity in Scrub and archness of eye in Don John was equally excellent and as variousOn Frodsham the eye of terror had no such effect for if he had noticed and thought Mr Garrick's eyes were penetrating he would inwardly have comforted himsel  his own were equally brilliant if not superiorly so When Frodsham had finished Hamlet's first speech and without stop  To be or not to be  c Garrick said  "Well hey now hey you have a smattering but you want a little of my forming and really in some passages you have acquired tones I do not by any means approve" Frodsham tartly replied "Tones Mr Garrick to be sure I have tones but you are not familiarized to them I have seen you act twice Hamlet the first and I thought you had odd tones and Mrs Cibber strange tones and they were not quite agreeable to me on the first hearing but I dare say I should soon be reconciled to them""Why now" says the much astonished wondering Garrick "nay now that iswhy now really Frodsham you are a dd queer fellowbut for a fair and full trial of your genius my stage  shall be open and you shall act any part you please and if you succeed we will then talk of terms" "O" says Frodsham in the same flighty flow of spirits "you are mistaken my dear Mr Garrick if you think I came here to solicit an engagement I am a Roscius at my own quarters I came to London purposely to see a few plays and looking on myself as a man not destitute of talents I judged it a proper compliment to wait on a brother genius I thought it indispensable to see you and have half an hour's conversation with youI neither want nor wish for an engagement for I would not abandon or relinquish the happiness I enjoy in Yorkshire for the first terms your great and grand city of London could afford"  and with a negligent wild bow made his exit and left the gazing Garrick following his shade like Shakspeare's ghost himself standing in an attitude of surprise to ruminate and reflect and to relate this account of the strangest mad actor he had ever seen or ever after did see Mr Garrick told me these particulars himself and a narrative much of the same purpose I had from Mr Frodsham when I became acquainted with him in Yorkshire Mr Garrick declared he never beheld such a strange mixture of merit and genius as in that  eccentric  Frodsham and Frodsham without any idea of offence weakly judged that  his fame was equally known with the other great man's and he was determined such an established actor as the York idol should not be deemed rude by being in London and not visiting his brother Hamlet's altar Frodsham's remarks were rude and not true relative to tones for Mr Garrick spoke Hamlet as naturally and void of particular tones as ever was heard his voice being remarkably harmonious strong and pleasing though in his hesitation and repetition off the stage he threw it into an affected manner which habit had formed into nature As to Mrs Cibber's Ophelia though I have seen many good ones I have not seen her like nor ever expect it as her singing voice figure and features all combined will never let me bury in oblivion her remembrance  They all wither'd when my poor father died  Methinks I see her now  Where  In my mind's eye Horatio  But tones until familiarized may prevent favourite comedians till their merit is established from having their voice relished and approved When I first heard Mr Quick his voice did not much please me Now I never hear the sound of it even from behind the scenes but I am as eager as any other attendant involuntarily to laugh it  has to me so whimsical and very agreeable an effect With the tragedian this apparent difficulty is n t so easily got over Ryan's voice was bad to a degree so was Mrs Woffington's Ryan by having merit and worth was sanctioned and Mrs Woffington by the aid of beauty and merit was a great favourite in Jane Shore Lady Jane Gray c c but these are wonderful hazards to encounter  Before I quit Mr Frodsham's mode of behaviour at London I must inform the reader that the said harumscarum young gentleman unless he waited on Johnny Rich of Covent Garden theatre that manager he feared would arraign him of being deficient in point of goodbreeding otherwise he had not the least inclination to bestow an hour on that gentleman as he had been informed Mr Rich's genius was superficial and supposing he neither understood plays Greek nor Latin but encouraged pantomime only he held him in the greatest contemptIndeed the applause at York he commanded and received from every alehouse had intoxicated his brain as much as the plentiful potations of  York burgundy  with which and other pleasant spirited draughts he too soon finished his early days of life and fame He had by the lower people been so loaded with more fancied honours than he could carry that he had not a serious afterreflection or  thought to inform him he had acted wrong in his deportment manners and behaviour to Mr Garrick He knew Garrick's great fortune and his own  no fortune at all  but allowed no professional superiority in talents c and when he spoke to Mr Garrick he said he of course supposed that Mr Garrick knew he was speaking to as good a gentleman as himself and an actor on much the same footing of merit For the bravos and encouragement he received in his best days at York were certainly flattering and from those causes combined with his own selfopinion had confirmed to him that he was secure of the highest opinion from all the nobility of England because a few saw him in a York raceweek With Rich he met with a very different reception from that of the Drury Lane patentee He found him teaching a young lady to act with three or four cats about him After his being some time in the room when announced Rich viewed him through a very large readingglass took his snuff and said  "Well Mr Frogsmire I suppose you are come from York to be taught and that I should give you an engagement Did you ever act Richard Mr Frogsmire""Yes Sir""Why then you shall hear me act"  says Richwhen he spoke a speech in a most ridiculous manner And on its being concluded Frodsham pettishly told him he  did not visit him nor come from York to be taught nor to hear him act he came like Lord Chalkstone merely for a little conversation and to view his Elysian fields But as Mr Rich loved leisure and had little curiosity he replied that unless  Muster  Frogsmire would with humble attention hear his Richard he would not hear Mr Frogsmire at all Frodsham was preparing to make an exit while Rich was ruminating and proceeding with  'Twas an excuse to avoid me  Alas she keeps no bed  When he was suddenly interrupted by Mr Frodsham with  "I wish you good morning"  and so ended unthinking Frodsham's second managerial visitHe returned to Ebor's plains and was joyfully received thereHe was not forgot by Garrick as he often to his performers related the story of that  mad York actor  as he termed him And Rich without thinking of any such trifling occurrence continued teaching young pupils to act stroked his cats and the York Roscius was never more by him remembered  The last night Frodsham ever spoke on the stage was in October After playing Lord Townly and though in apparent great spirits he died within three days after  "Ladies and gentlemen  on Monday evening  Coriolanus  To which will be added looking seriously and laying his hand a on his heart  What we must all come to  Which expression will serve as a pause to my imperfections and digressions and afford my reader a leisure for five minutes reflection  I will here take it for granted that the reader has ruminated on giddy Frodsham's exit from the world's stage and once more resume my discourse to inform the peruser that during my few days retirement at Mr Baker's after the races I received the favour of an invitation from Mr Whitely director of the Doncaster theatre requesting I would perform a few nights there after the races as himself and troop were to attend that meeting and continue some weeks afterwards The offer exactly tallied with my plan for convenience as it filled up the space until I should be wanted at Hull and also would add grist to my mill I continued with good Mr Baker at my house or rather his at York till I went to Doncaster and he stayed with me till then out of compliment for he usually was with the company I went and Mr Whitely gave bills with a long puff of  "Walk in and see the wonderful great actor he had engaged  from London Dublin Edinburgh c"  I acted there three weeks Miss Whitely was the young heroine a very pretty and handsome young lady she promised well as an actress but thank her stars she is much better provided for than being obliged to rely on the stage She married Mr Goslin of Stamford where she is happily situated and is just as irresistible a woman now as she was a girl then During my continuance at Doncaster I lived entirely with Mr Stanuel who at that time kept the Green Dragon and to whose civilities I was greatly indebted and have never forgot and I am glad of this public opportunity to acknowledge them and present my thanks to him Mr Stanuel now moves on a larger scale and in a more exalted sphere as he is master of an elegant and much improved inn well known and genteelly supported under the name of the Red Lion  My benefit play there was the Merchant of Venice my Tea and Duke and no Duke It was particularly honoured with not only being  ry full but all the genteel families came on that occa  on to our little theatre and no wonder for besides the compliment paid to me Sir George Cooke's mother who was much beloved by all the families in Doncaster and its neighbourhood did me the honour unasked to patronize my play Sir George Cooke lives at Wheatly near Doncaster  His own lady inherits every virtue and endearing quality which demands and receives universal respect esteem and admiration  I returned back to York and then posted next day for Beverley where my friend Mr Baker waited for me and after that ceremony escorted me to Hull which was early in the month of November My first appearance was in King Lear I had every reason to be pleased not only from the attention and warm applause of the audience but from the civilities paid me by several of the leading inhabitants I studied Zanga which character was not only there but after that at  York  generally looked on as my master piece in tragedy and notwithstanding the variety of principal performers it is equally spoken of and flatteringly allowed to be more than a performance of mediocrity at this day  As I have mentioned civilities at that time with which I was favoured at Hull Mr Melling I am sure will pardon the liberty I presume on when I beg leave to mention his name with that respect esteem and gratitude which from me and every one who knows him is truly his due He is  gentleman whom all must revere and the common enemy of man cannot be so devilish as to hate though he cannot but envy I glory i  having an opportunity to express my heartf  l  steemit is just to give applause where it is deserved Indeed I wish not to be fulsome with panegyric for to strangers it is of no use and to those who are so happy as to be acquainted with that gentleman it is needless as they well know and must feel the truth of my assertions Selflove and vanit  must partly plead my excuse with Mr Melling here as I wish to inform the world that that worthy good man I boast of was my particular friend from the year to this day He has ever been anxious and happy to serve meThough no youngster he is esteemed and revered by the young as well as the old and has proved to me a second Mr Chaigneau If I were to write his epitaph I would place the following lines of Lord Lyttleton's on his tombstone which I hope for years will not be wanted for the sake of his friends and Mr and Mrs Dorrington  No party his benevolence confin'd  No  ect alike it flow'd to all mankind  He lov'd his friends forgive this gushing tear  Alas I feel I am no actor here  He  ov'd his friends with such a warmth of heart  So clear of int'rest  o devoid of art  Such gen'rous freedom suc  unshaken zeal  No words can speak it but our hearts may tell  A sympathising love of others bliss  Where will you find another's mind like his  Hull for hospitality and plenty of good cheer with too much welcome intitles that town in my opinion to the appellation of  "The Dublin of England"  The many acts of kindness I received in that friendly seat o  asions my being oftener in bad health at Hull than at any other place in my yearl  round An odd circumstance happened at Kingston which seemed to promise good luck but was the cause of unfortunate disaster My  attering introduction at that place occasioned my being introduced to a Colonel Appleton at Beverley and strange to relate that seeming honour occasioned my losing the little jewel Beverley from the crown of my York imperial dia  emIt was usual for the comedians as before related after the York races to halt at Beverley for a short space To the southern reader it may not be amiss to inform such lady or gentleman that Beverley is not a town of trade but like York i  chiefly supported by the genteel private families that  s  e there in a continuance York is thinned as to resort of company public weeks excepted unless the latter part of the winter season nea  the I ent assizes I cannot boast of any permane  t intimac  es with superior persons at Beverley beyond a kind of summer friendship that with the  east gust drops off I lost that genteel p  ac  of residence owing to what I will here faithfull  relate tho' not strictly according with the time of what occurred near the period I am recording of Hull as my misfortune happened in when all my theatres were greatly supportedAt that time my lease at Beverley was nearly expiredI was up to the ears in building a new theatre at Leeds and in the interim for experiment tried Beverley and Hull races while the Leeds mansion was finishing when to my astonish  ent and every person's equal surprise I was ordered by Colonel Appleton then mayor notwithstanding strong application from ladies and the officers of the East Riding militia then assembled to march bag and baggage out of the townan insult and disgrace I believe never offered to any regular company in this world and in a place where certainly so well established and good a company of comedians was a feather of honour rather than the contrary as from its situation they never can have a company of fixed or superior estimationHowever my royalty of patents with York in one hand and that of Hull in the other could not melt nor soften an obdurate rock or prevail with that upright judge to deviate so far as to wink at a breach of law by suffering a naughty play at Beverley tho' he had evidently gone nine miles from Beverley to Hull for the purpose of seeing one at which time Hull was not a patent theatreBut as lawless as  its neighbour where he exercised his supreme authority the result w  s maintained the company for three weeks without their being permitted to act in my own theatre which of course amounted to a considerable sum Why a gentleman whom I never to my knowledge offended but held in respectful esteem sh  uld have used me thus oppressively and trampled on a sufferer as it exacted from me an enormous expence bordering on  one hundred pounds  perhaps indeed had I urged that sensitive point  my money  some feeling might have found passage for the strolling plaintiff has been from that time to this inexplicable unless the following circumstance was his grand motive and reason for such ungentlemanlike and indeed such cruel behaviour which surely can only be accounted for as owing to that strange turn too often seen felt and experienced from a desp  tic and proud disposition  Two years before the said Colonel had desired to have a row in a stage box for my benefit at Hullthe places were set down but the Colonel had not as was and is the usage sent a servant to secure  hem and it was and is also the custom that at the end of the first act of a play none  an be kept for any rank or degree whatever The Colonel  id no  arrive till the second act was performing consequently his  eats were filled up  and though the ladies and gentlemen in the boxes offered to make him every convenience he would not accept it but was highly enraged and offended at what in fact was entirely his own faultHe declared he would not continue a minute longer in the theatre and departed instantly swelling with dignity almost even to the bursting and vowing vengeance on the Wilkinsonthe which he put in execution in the manner I have relatedand it has often brought good Shakspeare's lines as applicable to that powerful magistrate  Oh 'tis excellent  To have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous  To use it like a giant  O but man proud man  Dressed in a little brief authority  Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd  His glassy essence like an angry ape  Plays such fantastic tricks before high Heav'n  As make the angels weep  If what I have now recorded respecting the treatment I undeservedly received yet myself only to pay the piper be in the slightest particle false I will against my own selfpartiality admit he was  perfectly right  and it will be my real temper and pride to retract and acknowledge error or any de  iation from the strictest rectitude  After my safe escape from Colonel Appleton's magisterial authority with my baggagewaggons c to Hull races without capture where I was received with welcome I have looked upon it as a duty for the Beverley residents to be here made acquainted with the true motives which compelled me to abandon that spot as I have for several years been much indebted to the inhabitants of that town of every degree for their frequent visitations to the Hull theatre particularly on my own benefit night for let the weather prove ever so discouraging there always has been several persons of every description on that occasion  My benefit at Hull on my  first visit  in December was flattering to a degree not a place in the boxes to be purchased but with as much difficulty as if Mr Garrick was to have acted so I may vaunt of  "O the days when I was young"  My play was The Orphan of China which had never been acted there My dish of Tea at which there were no qualms misconceptions or abuseall went down gliblyThe farce was Love AlaModeBut the difference of representation and the opinion of the Hull audience was so indulgent  that night  as made me feel overpaid for the vexations and mishaps that attended my performing Sir Archy at York I made my best bow my best speech and from the front of the house to  the performers behind the curtain there was an instance of mutual harmony and not one amongst them was more pleased than my good genius Mr Baker with whom I went accidentally to York meaning to pass one week and bid in all probability that place an eternal adieu as an actor  I had engaged on my own terms with Mr Ivory the proprietor for the whole season at Norwich till the benefits commenced at that town My quarters were secured in the London coach my baggage all packed and I was near the eve of my departure from York city that January being the l  st place of wishing to stay at or even to deign visiting in future On the Thursday several gentlemen waited on Mr Baker hearing I was in York and informed him that many ladies and gentlemen would esteem themselves much indebted to Mr Wilkinson's politeness if he would assist the charity for the boys and girls play on the following Saturday and favour them so far on that night as to oblige them with the farce of Love AlaMode and perform Mr Macklin's character of Sir Archy Mac SarcasmReader are you not thunderstruckbut rest satisfied it is no more strange than true Mr Baker referred the gentlemen to me very properly observing he had no right to make any request of the kindthe which ceremony they paid me I was then  traversing the stage as a noon walkthere they repeated their pe  ition In answer I urged the inconvenience an  that  y journey c would not permit my time for being at Norwich being fixed and in particu ar mentioned had that not been so urgent I had a particular aversion ever to think o  acting in Love AlaMode in future at York as the treatment I had sustained during the representation of that excellent farce in the last raceweek was such as would deter me from atte  pting Sir Archy on that stage again and from that per  or  ance begged to be excused but added if my acting any other part either in play or farce or both could p ssibly contribute to their entertain  ent and assist the charity my services such as they were the public might freely command Mr Tasker of York was with the gentlemen and he immediately replied that several leading families were then at York for the winter season who were not there in the raceweek and those persons who were so anxious to have Love AlaMode had seen it often acted in London that it could not be denied but a strange misconception had prevailed the night it had been presented in the raceweek but the ladies one and all who had been at the last concert night assured Mr Wilkinson they should be highly entertained if he would treat them with Love AlaMode I  began to relax in my sulkiness and with a little more persuasion added to my own good opinion of the piece an  to regain my honour in Sir Archy complied with their solicit tions but told them I expected applause not insult which was readily promis  d it was a debt of honour and was justly paid as they kept their words even to overbalance with added interest for the whole  arce was a continued roar of approbation and laughterO reader how is this jumble of events to be accounted fo  as Hamlet says  "There is something in this more than natural if Philosophy coul  find it out"  And what is more worthy observation that very farce of Love AlaMode which had four months before grieved my heart in  ugust should in cold January not only render ba  k c  mpensation with excess  f warm joy but was actually the sole cause of rendering York ma  y years my agreeable place of residence with a cheerful happy home as the circumstance evidences from J  nuary  to this dav June his Majesty's birthdayGod bless the King send him a long and prosperous reignand ma  I live with health and happiness to repeat my yearly petition  The narration I have just now given fully proves how strange perplexed various and unforeseen and how little we can tell what properly ought to  be done for the best or judge of consequences in our short uncertain date of human life  The leading persons were so pleased with their entertainment and my acquiescence that they called a consultation the day following the charityplay at which meeting they mentioned that the York theatre was in a very declining state even to the disgrace of the citydirty scenes dirty clothes all dark and dismalAs to the scenes being so tattered it must be granted as inexcu  able as Mr Baker was a painte  of eminence his knowledge and taste in drawing will ever speak for him while one of his remaining prints of York or Lincoln minster is to be seenBut in defence of laziness I must mention his advanced age with two bad servants attending him as natural enemiesthe gout and the rheumatism The gentlemen urged to Mr Tasker that as Mr Wilkinson was universally acquainted with theatrical matters and having been in London here there and every where it w  uld be greatly for the advantage of Mr Baker and also for the public if he would make Mr Wilkinson such an offer as might render it worth his while on reflection to tempt him to  ix his residence at York as Mr Wilkinson certainlv must b  that time have satisfied himself with a life of rambling But in that point they were mistaken Mr Tasker was desired to consider  that proposal and wait on Mr Baker with what they partially termed  the general opinion of the town  Mr Tasker lost no time as he loved business but instantly waited on Mr Baker and informed him of the particulars of those gentlemen's opinions Mr Baker though really attached to me yet hesitated on that sudden intelligence as it seemed to threaten a blow on his own consequence arbitrary sway and love of power which few have philosophy sufficient to adopt and approve He told Mr Tasker that his friend Tate got a great deal of money at various places and that York theatre could not by any means afford to pay Mr Wilkinson such a sufficient compensation as would induce him to give up his yearly excursions and be plagued with the neverceasing troubles that daily attend the attempt of guiding a company of comedians whose various tempers van  ties and self expectations were to the full as difficu  t to satisfy as the public and concluded wit  flatly pronouncing that the matter was impracticableMr Tasker an  wered him that it was not impra  icableit might be easily accomplishedand without some essential assistance at this juncture to the theatre he told Mr Baker he must be ruined and Providence had thrown Mr Wilkinson there at that time perhaps for the preservation of bothHe persisted with hintin  to Mr Baker that by having built a new theatre at York from his own pocket he had run into a debt that would involve him much  "and you say" added Mr Tasker "that you esteem  ate Wilkinson as your son why then in God's name make him your adopted heir and act as his fatheryou have neither children nor relations make Wilkinson survivor to all your theatrical propertylet your dwellinghouse be his homegive his benefits at York Hull and Newcastle clear from all chargesappoint him a competent salaryand as Mr Wilkinson has accumulated some few hundreds borrow such sums on bondallow him interest for his money and your property being assigned to him will be more than a sufficient secur  ty"  The money which Baker wanted had with him the gr  atest weight in the argument as it generally has with all the human race He told Mr Tasker that he had a sincere regard for the young gentleman and af  er a short silence and sighing woefully he said if Mr Tasker would make such a proposal to Mr Wilkinson he would agree to it and hoped it would be for the comfort and happiness of both declaring had he possessed a fortune he could not have bequeathed it to any one with more satisfaction than to his adopted Tate for he had proved himself a good son and he had for that worthy point of character  looked on himself as Mr Wilkinson's parental guardian from the time of his mother's deathThe dialogue thus finished Mr Tasker called on me to walk half an hour in the Minster  nd soon broached related and explained all the particulars just now inserted The being exalted to the rank of general that is being created a  anager struck my bewildere  fancy an  I glow  d at the ideait was impossible for me to conceal the eagerness with which I embraced the offer  And so I dreamt of  riches honour pow'r    'Twas  but a dream tho' and that dream is o'er  Certainly at that time I walked in my sleep and it was long before I waked  or my imagination was crowded with an end to my cares little supposing they were then only beginning and my uncontroulable lordly will and my selfsufficiency prevented any apprehensions from those rocks wh  re other managers had split been involved and shipwrecked for my wisdom and experience I to myself pronounced would guide the

My fir  t de  ut as re  ent was in January Corio  anus for Mr  benefit My gradual attempts at reformation cost me more pains  and met with much more obstinate opposition from the performers than the public I shall not enter upon the various adventures that have happened in the long course of almost twentyfive years yet as I have included my entrance as commander in chief I must describe one severe edict in force when I assumed the regency reins though not altogether unnoticed in the foregoing part of this history as I recollect having hinted at something like it when speaking of the Norwich companyI mean the custom of the man and his wife returning thanks on the stageand what was truly dreadful the draggletailed Andromache in frost rain hail and snow delivering her benefit playbills from door to door  "where piercing winds blew sharp and the chill rain dropped from some penthouse on her wretched head"  But use had in some measure rendered it familiarand no wonder if Hector's widow when suppliant and in tears was induced on such solicitations to accept with thanks a cheering drop When I mentioned that degrading and painful custom to the company at York previous to my being manager they seemed to lament the woes they sustained as the laborious custom of their workhouse duty for it really was little less humbling and to have heard those complaints a stranger would naturally have inquired  Are all these wretches slaves  And the reader particularly if theatrical will start with astonishment when  aver on my word that when I put the law in force to entirely and decidedly relieve those ladies and gentlemen from the co  plained of evident hardship it was received by the then York company of with marks o  disgu  t and a conspired combination against me their chief in consequence ensuedSuch is the force of habit and the use of compl  ing with despicable meanness rather than run the hazard o  losing a trifleSo how could I make those free that were by nature slaves Their pleas were that the  quality would not come  a phrase co  stantl  used in country towns by the lo  e  people that the town i  habitants would be  and that Mr  ilkin  on was not subje  ed  o su h supe  c  ous d  ty besid  s it was app  rently to t  e advantage of the th  atre and as the  anager shared the receipts on benefit nights he had no cause to complain or be dissatisfied he reaped the advantages and the perfor  ers only had the difficulties to encounter  hose ar  uments  tr  ated as tutile weak absurd and not to the purposeI gave my an  wer as a determined one First I  bserved the discredit they appeared in when compared with the per  ormers in London Dublin Edinburgh Liverpool Bath and every  other theatre under regular and gentlemanlike establi  hment and what weighed in my opinion even more materially was that I was con  med  n  y own judgment that not any performer of the  east distingui  hed reputation gentleman or lady would ever professionally visit the York or Hull theatres where such despicable compliance was to be exacted or in consequence of not obeying run the hazard of forfeiting their claim to favour and patronage from the public at large and be termed impertinent proud affected and impudent Therefore I against all remonstrances  or fear of public alehouse abuse which most managers have the happiness of undergoing  not only made enacted and confirmed as a law that the manner of returning thanks and parading the streets with playbills should be utterly abolished and that the modes of the respectable theatres as far as practicable should be introduced and put into practice  Good God what a sight to actually behold Mr Frodsham  red as a gentleman with fine natural talents and esteemed in York as a Garrick the Hamlet of the age running after or stopping a gentleman on horseback to deliver his benefit bill and beg half a crown then the price of the boxes During Mr Baker's life I never had authority sufficient to prevent the performers from constantly attending the assemblyrooms and presenting  their petitions but when I was exalted from r  gent to the being sole monarch for the credit of York city and myself I was  then  obeyed though in all states there will be now and then refractory blackhearted rebels start up whose soul  are truly malignant and not to be controuled but in the end such people m ke themselves so hated and despised that in consequence of their bad tongues and their own actions giving the lie to their fawning and dissembled goodness their services are shunned every where and they fall into the net they designed for others  A year before Mr Baker's death I expende  no less than l by obtaining an act of parliament in my own name for two royal patents for twentyone years for York and Hull theatres which the parliament and his Majesty honoured me with granting and about seven years since his Majesty again honoured me with renewed patents for which to my gracious sovereign and to the high assembled Lords and Commons I humbly dutifully and with the truest gratitude submissively hop  the  will honour me by their acceptance of my sincere thanks and acknowledgments By that grant it is a security for the sums I have expended besides being dubbed  esquire  and my troop being relieved from the subterfuge of acting  nder a concert of music and

of misery or real grief And though my life has been checquered by innumerable situations in which I have been whimsically and variously placed consequently no wonder if I ha  e often acted right that I have also oftener acted wrong and like an eager child have not only tasted but devoured the sweets and now make faces at a few bitters and wish and want to be secure of health and happiness on bond

Patentee  as christened by Mr Woodfall make a collection of some  particular occurrences  and  personages  that may divert and direct the southern or northern readers theatrical or otherwise to understand as to incomes of every theatrical government also a list of such principal London and other performers as I have had the satisfaction to introduce to and grace the York stage with for the credit of myself and that city to the present time with the merits of the York performers in rotation I shall also mention particulars relative to the Edinburgh theatre where I had the honour to be manager for one whole season and two race weeks and many other theatrical  excursions and favours from particular person  Also the Hull Leeds Doncaster Wakefield a  Pontefract theatres from the year I

bowing with adoration t  my God for his peculiar goodness and his snatching me from the brink of the grave when sun  with poverty and every threatening approach of misery and then li  ting me up with his own almighty arm and restoring me to instant health accompanied with worthy and benevolent friends respect and affluence which prevented at the same time the best of mothers from sinking with her grey hairs into the grave with sorrow and blessing me with the power and the will to give comfort to her latter years and days and above all am cons  led with my parent's confession to God that her

OLD AND NEW  THEATRICAL SCHOOLS  A poor player  Who frets and struts his life upon the stage    And then is heard no more  THE MIRROR OR ACTOR'S TABLET  We come like shadows so depart  AS in my elbow though not always my easy chair I love to prattle and tell old tales and remember with advantage what feats were done I must here entreat the patience a  d attention of such young persons who fix their present thoughts on stage pageantry and their views on future greatness wherein they image to their pleasing warm ideas how far they shall surpass those whom they now look up to and admire for there are many actors and actresses of the present age not yet arrived at mediocrity as professors yet are advanced in years and far on their journey to the world's end who boldly affirm that were the actors of the old school now in being they would not please if they were to dress their characters as they did forty or sixty years ago There certainly  the present actors' observations would be right but in point of sterling acting surely in an error  That there are gentlemen and ladies of infinite merit in most stage departments I rejoice at as their emolument is a reward to their merits as well as for the honour and credit of the profession  As to dress I draw this conclusion that was Mr Garrick existing with the vigour and appearance of thirty yet if he was to act Ranger now he certainly would not dress that agreeable rake as he did fortythree years before this time but as Mr Lewis or any other competent judge does dress that character And as to the acting I must persist and there are thousands living to back my assertion that Mr Garrick would have been a natural performer one hundred years ago▪ he was the most shining general player I have yet seen and were he to act Ranger an hundred years hence he would be a natural Ranger then▪ and for a very simple rule Mr Macklin was  the old and is now of the new school yet I never heard of his deviating from Nature as an instructor or an actorfor Nature ever will be Na+tureMr King's and Mr Yates's excellencies  the old school prove thisShakspeare wrote two  hundred years ago and could he write in the pres  nt aera he could not make the characters better in boldness or expression of language than those he wrote beforeI do not impertinently or like  n old stager sayCould Mr Quin and Mr Ryan act now they would give the same satisfaction as they did thenThe reason is evident though they pleased the audiences of that age yet the mode and manner not being natural in many characters the present good discriminating taste that pervades would not relish or suffer it Mr Quin's tragedy was strutting pompous languid tiresome and wanted spirit But the same idea of one hu  dred years given just now as a supposition for Mr Garrick's Ranger would have an equal claim at present with Mr Quin's Falstaff for he was much the best any living person has seen as he had every requisite from Nature And though Henderson had great merit his Falstaff was much inferior as all he did was the effect of study and art having neither the person the voice nor the eye in particular for that partin each of these material points Henderson was deficient Now Quin with a bottle of claret and a full house the instant he was on the stage was Sir John Falstaff himself  As the wellteaming earth  With rivers and show'rs  With smiling brings forth  Her fruits and her flow'rs  So Faistaff will never decline  Still fruitful and gay  He moistens his clay  And his rain and his rivers are wine  Of the world he has all but its care  No load but of flesh will he bear  He laughs off his pack  Takes a cup of old sack  And away with all sorrow and care  Quin's Harry the Eighth Sir John Brute all the Falstaffs Old Bachelor Volpone Ape mantus Brutus Ventidius Bishop Gardiner Clause Gloster were all with several others all his own nor have those characters already mentioned ever truly flourished as when inspired by him But out of his particular walk he was ever bordering on the ridiculousHis Richard was very heavy laborious and unnatural and it was  then  thought so as I recollect reading a list of plays in a magazine for the year where in the catalogue of tragedies and comedies there inserted was the following line  King RICHARD by Quin  Much hissed  His Othello Macbeth Lear c all as bad He  played ChamontWhat would our modern beaux think of young Chamont as I have seen Mr Quin act it at the age of sixty He was equipped in a long grisly halfpowdered p  iwig hanging low down on each side the breast and down the back a heavy scarlet coat and waistcoat trimmed with broad gold lace  la  k velvet breeches a black silk neckcloth black s  ockings a pair of squaretoed shoes with an oldfashioned pair of stone bucklesand the youthful the fiery Chamont adorned himself with a pair of stiff hightop'd white gloves with a broad ol  scollop'd laced hat which when taken off the head and having pressed the old wig and vie  ng his fair round belly with fat capon lined he lo  ked like Sir John Brute in the drunken scene  Mr Garrick brought to the world's light the spirited Chamont old Ryan was the strong and lusty Polydore with a red face and voice truly horrible which like Portia you might quickly have distinguished  "He knows me as the bl  nd man does the cuckoo by my bad voice"  Ryan also added bad deportment and was not near so well dressed as Quin's Chamont though in much the same extraordinary manner and by them stood Mr Barry in Castalio in a neat bag wig then of the newest  ashion in his bloom and prime of li  e and was certainly  one of the handsomest men ever seen on or off the stage with Mrs Cibber allelegance and neatness by his side as Monimia The sight of the two ancient heroes of antiquity made such a contrast in the Quartetto that it struck even my features at the age of eleven with risibility If so what a whimsical feeling of tragicomedy must it have diffused on the muscles of the pit critics who then decided all disputes damnations c which at present to save the audience trouble the morning papers have taken most of the grand articles of setting up or knocking down into their own custody  It is incumbent to remember though Ryan's figure for Phocyas Frankley Sir George Airy c would now appear extravagantly ridiculous yet on the London boards no actor for a course of years could have stood more esteemed and respectable and be it observed that in despite of a  l these deficiencies of voice manner person dress years c his Edgar mad scene of Orestes fourthact scene of M  cduff Ford Dumont in Jane Shore nay even Lord Townly though very likely p  rformed the same week by Mr Barry who was in every point most excellent in that character yet he never repeated the last scene of that part or the mad scenes of Edgar without evincing such a strong sense and feeling accompanied  with judgment as removed for the time all sight or sense of his defects and oddities Mr Woodward assured me that when Mr Garrick went with him to see Ryan's Richard the Third meaning to be inwardly merry that Garrick on the contrary was astonished at what he saw working in the mind of the ungraceful slovenly and illdressed figure which told him more than he before knew and which caused Garrick's bringing to light that unknown excellence as his own which in Ryan had remained unnoticed and buried  There are confessedly more than five to one actors of merit now to what there were in for their Cloughs Vaughans Dagger Mars Moze  ns Ackmans Andersons Pagets Oats's Redmans Wignals c c would not now were they living be permitted to act at the York or Hull theatres so nice are they grown and there is such decent acting in general throughout the kingdom Yet we must not suppose Mr Cibber did not understand polite life and good breeding when  e wrote the characters of Lord and Lady Townly they were judged so then and are so stilland prove that the author knew full as well what a lady of quality should be as the modern writers do Indeed our fine ladies at present on the stage are trifling  when compared with Lady Townly Lady Betty Modish Millamant Maria now Charlotte in the Hypocrite and several others As a proof those old written characters are what every young female fashionable candidate wishes to play ask Mrs Abington and Miss Farren what characters they choose to give the first impression in they will quickly answer Charlotte in the Hypocrite Shakspeare's Beatrice Lady Betty cNow if Cibber wrote his ladies characters and his fops well he at that time knew how to play them but that was according to the particular mode of his own which pleased But his manner would not please  now  I guess because that of another age His Foppington was a coxcomb of that time and Sir Fopling Flutter with Sir Courtley NiceNow there are no such characters extant and therefore Lord Foppington is not so pleasing a representative of quality as he was forty years ago And I not only think but venture to affirm against many judgments of stage opinions of a modern greenroom that the celebrated Mrs Oldfield's Lady Townly c would be now pronounced excellent My imagination leads me to pin faith on this opinion because my brethren will remark her tragedy did not suit with the bombastic taste of those actors who devoted themselves at the tragic shrine and the true cause has been that  she was more natural than her predecessors and her conversation and manners were universally admired as a lady which must have been the result of observation and her being admitted on a familiar and respectable footing with persons of the first distinction who admired the elegance of the actress and saw themselves in herAnd persons of true taste and distinction however the dress of the times may differ will ever be easy affable attractive and engagingNay it can be easily explained to young observers almost to a certainty for look back a very few years and they will find once a year that the  ton  for being seen in public in the month of January was naked and bare  nd another year the neck and bosom all muffled and barricaded in July and August Yet to a Duchess of Devonshire or Rutland both natives and foreigners bow with admiration in the same manner whether the behind is swelled or diminished as whatever they do ease and elegance must be attendants therefore the habiliment to such persons matters very little to a critical observer whether they are seen decked simply in an Irish poplin or accoutred in all the gaudy plumes of the most extravagant chan  e of prevailing Paris fashions And if Mrs Oldfield's dress for Lady Townly or Lady Betty with Mrs Abington's or any other fine lady's dress were now put  into a fire the latter would be consumed to ashes that might help a hothouse but I fear not produce intrinsic worthbut the Oldfield's would prove  Like purest gold that's tortur'd in the furnance  Comes out more bright and brings forth all its weight  The expence for the necessary profusion of stagedresses is enormous but there is nothing real Taste may be discerned That this is the period for taste in dress will be readily admitted but the money expended and all the true value rests in the word  taste  I know this myself perfectly by having had about twenty years ago an old wardrobe I found in the ruins of my theatrical Herculaneum and which was of  antiquity and had appertained to Roman emperors kings c when not a performer lady or gentleman of the London theatres but would have involuntarily laughed at the old broad seams of gold and silver lace and have cast piteous and contemptuous looks on the country performers thus loaded with trumpery Yet those despicable clothes had at different periods of time bedecked real lords and dukes and were bought at much less price than now and would produce by one day's labour of stripping merely the old materials forty or fifty pounds to provide a supper if the stomach required And I can assert and prove that my present wardrobe  is far superior to any out of London without excepting Dublin or Edinburgh and has been attended with considerable expence far beyond the bounds of prudence or commonsense It is true as a purchaser of the theatre the wardrobe is of great cost and value and would shew a play without fear or disgrace to any audience whatever as numbers can testify but would not in a state of bankruptcy pay INTRINSICALLY as the old despised King Lear's suit almost singly would have done as all now consists of foil spangles beads interwoven fast embroidery silks satins c which soon wear An old petticoat made for a large hoop of the Duchess of Northumberland thirty  ears ago would have served a queen in the theatre  everal years then descended to a duchess of Suffolk afterwards made two handsome tragedy shapes for an old rich Spaniard and ten years after that burn and produce money to purchase thirty yards of lustring for a modern stage lady Thirty years ago not a Templar or decentdressed young man but wore a rich gold laced hat and scarlet waistcoat with a broad gold laceas the miser says  "he carried an estate upon his back"  also laced frocks for morning dress I have now worn occasionally by comedians for old characters of wealth a suit of purple  oth with gold vellum holes that I frequently  wore when a young man as a fashionable dress and spoke the prologue to the Author gave Tea c on the London stage and after that used it as my common dress to parade the streets at noon But I must justly coincide with the point of truth and declare the characteristic dressing of plays forty years ago was very inferior indeed to what is seen in these riper years particularly the comedians At that time no more than two or three principal characters at Covent Garden in particular were well dressed and those not with any variety as now Mrs Woffington's wardrobe had only the increase of one tragedysuit in the course of the season in addition to the clothes allotted to her unless she indulged herself and she had a new suit for Sir Harry Wildair in which character Mrs Woffington looked the man of fashion and Mrs Jordan sports now in Sir Harry one of the best legs in the kingdom Sir Joshua Reynolds is a judge of legs and has like Paris with his apple given his decree on that said leg  But the gentlemen and ladies in moderndressed tragedies forty years ago at Covent Garden theatre wore the old laced clothes which had done many years service at Lincoln'sInnFields besides having graced the original wearers and the ladies were in large hoops and the velvet petticoats heavily embossed proved extremely inconvenient  and troublesome and always a page behind to hear the lover's secrets and keep the train in graceful decorum If two princesses met on the stage with the frequent stagecrossing then practised it would now seem truly entertaining to behold a page dangling at the tail of each heroine and I have seen a young lady not of the most delicate form who sustained that office frequentlya Miss Mullartthey are now dismissed as judged unnecessary and superfluousbut luckily they were pages of honour and as truly to be depended upon as Edinburgh caddies as I have never heard of any misdemeanor brought into court by their impeachmentYet theatrical l  ngs and queens like their brethren mortals sometimes have been frail but they were family secrets and ought not to be mentioned again I have seen Mrs Woffington dressed in high taste for Mrs Phillis for then all ladies' companions or gentlewomens' gentlewomen actually appeared in that style of dress nay even the comical Clive dressed her Chambermaids Lappet Lettice c in the same manner authorised from what custom had warranted when they were in their younger days and in my remembrance not a first servant maid or unfortunate female that usurped a right of Strand walk which she termed her own trodden ground from St MaryleStrand  to Exeter Change but what swaggered in her large banging hoop to the terror of any young novice who dared usurp a footing of those territoriesIn short a large hoop was a requisite and indispensable mode of dress Strict propriety of habiliment not any manager has yet arrived at even in London and though it is so highly improved these last twenty years yet the achievement not even money will ever be able to obtain that is while the stage is honoured with pretty women as I sincerely hope it ever will be  or common sense reason persuasion nor intreaty will ever persuade handsome women to appear in a farmer's daughter or a witch or a servant maid but with the head dressed in full fashion and the feet deckin satin shoes yet I think they would be gainers by trying dear variety For what will attract more than the simple Quaker or the truly neat chambermaid and it is not every m  n that wishes for a duchess besides what an advantage to be seen in a gaudy attire one night and another arrayed in pure simplicity and be viewed with propriety in a green stuff gown c and not as Madge in Love in a Village or Betsy Blossom with a French head white silk stockings and white satin shoes by such contradictions Nature is as distant from the stage now as she was an hundred years ago and stuff  s  oes and clean cotton stockings would look not only as well but better by the preservation of characterNay the plain woman if such there be would not be behind hand as she would I  ear keep equal pace in absurdity and relinquish all pretensions to propriety by being as fantastical as the most beautiful young one And these contradictions of dress and manner of behaviour are often beheld off the stage by chance observers and are very properly introduced and ridiculed on and receive the rod of correction from the comic Muse as proper objects for the poet's satire and  he public mirth Not any plays throughout were ever dressed as they are nowthere the public enjoy a splendor indeed superior to their forefathers Also in the magnificence of theatres the scenery and lighting are now beyond compare but it is evident our grannies had an idea of what they did not possess as may be proved by the orders for scenery in Sir William Davenant's plays Dryden's Tempest King Arthur Lee's Constantine Cyrus the Great c c Except in Mr Rich's pantomimes the public then had seldom any scenery that proved of advantage so as to allure the eyeBut now frequently we have new scenery to almost every piece It was very uncommon formerly for new plays to  have more than what we term stock sceneryThere is one scene at Covent Garden used from to this day in the Fop's Fortune c which has wings and flat of Spanish figures at full length and two folding doors in the middleI never see those wings slide on but I feel as if seeing my very old acquaintance unexpectedly The advantage of the n  w established theatres is another useful alteration for these times tho' the Opera House when first finished must have been noble as we are told by  o  ley Cibber it was so large they could not be heard till the cieling was lowered and the house lessened The Little Theatre in the Hay Market as it was called twentysix years ago till it was beautified and put into its present form b  Mr Foote and Mr Colman would  now  cut a very  contemptible figure  in most towns of England and not fit to enter after seeing Bath Edinburgh Bristol Liverpool York and many other theatres By this progress and embel  ishment of regular handsome wellornamented theatres with good scenery wardrobe and band at York in particular the  er we may be assured that these theatres are superior to those wherein Booth Betterton and Cibber acted for though Drury Lane was larger than the most of our present country theatres yet forty years ago the audience part  of those London theatres were very crazy inconvenient and not pleasing to the eye and at present the staircase to the  upper boxes  at Drury Lane is so narrow that should an alarm of fire happen the persons in the two upper tier of boxes would be thrown into such confusion should they open at the same time the different doors the passage is so strait and they would so effectually block up each other that not one single soul could escape and their increasing fears would cause the situation to be alarming and dreadful to a degree Indeed Covent Garden is not so complete in that department at least it was not so when I saw that theatre before the late alterations The upper boxes at Edinburgh are far preferable to those at London for seeing and indeed in that respect are better than any theatre I know and it has an advantage like SmockAlley by the audience part being formed in a wellfinished circle Drury Lane like LondonBridge has been much frittered and patched at very great expence and after all the only way to repair will be to pull it down and erect a new onewhich I understand is to be done and I wish for health to see it finished In properbuilt convenient theatres I am told Paris has within these few years taken the lead though some time ago  was greatly inferior If they are like the plates  which I have of those theatres they appear very noble and spacious and not surrounded by buildings but good open road for carriages roundHowever as a print is not always to be depended on I cannot say more in praise of those structures but by what I guess and what I have heard concerning those in Paris and from the pictures sent to me from thence by Mr Maude of York who judged I should like a peep at those theatres being at such a distanceVeu de Theatre ItalienVeu de Theatre FrancoisL'Opera Proche la Porte Saint MartinThe Opera House is far superior particularly the stage as two hundred soldiers I am informed at times appear thereon in tragic pieces when it is necessary These alterations of theatres in the country I am not clear on mature deliberation have been done for the betterso much additional finery and splendor was not requisite as tolerable decent drapery may do very well for a house near TempleBar that would look despicable in GrosvenorSquareBesides while those inconveniences remained the first actors and actresses would not have deigned to visit the provincial playhouses for even when the theatres were closed sixty years ago no principal performer ever played as now at Liverpool Birmingham c as we may conclude from Mrs Centlivre's Prologue to her Busy Body  This season must things bear a smiling face  But play'rs in summer have a dismal case  Since your appearance only is our act of grace  Thirty years ago Mr Barry or Mrs Cibber would not have disgraced as they at that time judged their current London stamp for being paid in July in Birmingham coin on any account Indeed such would have been thought by their London patrons a most disagreeable and disgraceful exploit And the Londoners will be astonished to be truly informed that  now  Mrs Siddons Mrs Jordan and others make their true golden harvest on their summer excursions out of the metropolis Bath from its great fashionable resort and consequence has of course an improving theatre and though only one hundred miles distant from London causes in the Londoners many a wishful look to honour Bath with five or six nights in the course of a season and thereby secure a couple of hundred pounds But those Bath managers act more prudently as they never permit London or any other actors however the voice of fame may have exalted them to perform a few nights onlyMrs Crawford for instance lived there all the last winter but she was not offered any terms of engagement only such as the theatre would afford as expenditure for the whole season but no acting there for a short period to  take the cream and leave the skimmed milk fo  the managers and performers to exist on Consequently Bath not being capable to pay enormou  salaries the receipts being by no means adequate or proportionable as London must secure the principal performers for the winter and in case of disagreement Dublin and Edinburgh are equal to reward their labours by holding out a lucrative and happy asylum Great theatrical personages who formerly used to look upon a city or town as a  bore  now on the contrary in the summer grant they are commodious respectable and even alluring and with great good manners compliance and condescension will consent to trifle away a few nights at such insignificant places Even the Jordan herself who at present reigns as our modern Thalia has deigned to visit Cheltenham Reading Margate Richmond and Harrowgate which places yielded great profits silver medals and subscriptions falling at her feet in plentiful showers and she as greatness knows itself acts naturally on such occasionsBeing  earnest in her demands  I wish her every prosperity and hope she will accumulate  London performers when in the country have only the trouble to repeat their tasks like young scholars sent for a six weeks vacation who for the credit and pride of their papas and masters are expected  to return perfect and repeat when sent back to school The consequence of these visitors though it gratifies the pride of the audiences not forgetting also the manager's own  ostentation  in the principal theatres remote from the great city is not always productive though it gives a glare to enterprise therefore every manager out of London should watch his farm with as much fear and observance as a West Indian planter does a hurricane which destroys his fine prospect and he bestows three quarters of the year in hopes the fourth quarter's produce may make amends for devastationSo the manager with the little overplus gained should never lay out what is so dearly bought in too lavish improvements in a theatre for the absence of the reigning London favourite leaves a cold chill and omnious illfated blast on all theatrical culture for the year to come Indeed there are always people and money where fashion and inclination prompt them to attend a playhouse which when not so the theatre only obtains contempt false pity and less attendance It is true by these advantages which I have taken the liberty to mention plays are wonderfully altered for the better but was I asked  "If in consequence of such good fare are not the audiences altered for the better also"  I should be compelled to answer  "Indeed they are not  but far the contrary"  Frequently seeing the best acting has destroyed all theatrical  regular  relish I was lead formerly to believe when I first began the mode of procuring principal performers from London it would have given information to the people in general and made more and more converts to my conventicles but there I was egregiously mistaken for people who are not blessed with affluent fortunes in the middling class of life with proud minds and little souls have but as much for pleasures as they can prudently spare therefore if they expend in one week what would serve for a month for themselves and their families' purposes there is likely to be a drawbackbesides its being  unfashionable  and then all is over with a theatreFor many go to a play as the fine lady says sometimes becauseBecause why Because all the world is therenot to see the play but to be seen And it is surprising my own appetite did not inform me this for if I feed one week on pineapples grapes nectarines and peaches I would rather go without fruit the week following than eat common pears plums or blackberries Indeed patents have not only been a security for theatrical property but have put the country actors on a more decent level which was highly necessary for though there are exceptions from all wellbred persons yet an actor in London is  very differently respected to what he is in the country It is so in common lifewe are connected with or behaved to by a dependent or independent acquaintance as interest caprice or the humour hits A Cockney merely confined to London and who thinks it a journey from Wapping to Covent Garden to see the play is certainly of all critics one of the worst for he was born in London and lives in London and any brother mechanic from a distant county is looked on as ignorant and told how to  comport  himself On retrospect I recollect an instance of this kind in myself for till the age of seventeen I judged every man and woman I saw ignorant and stupid who  ived two miles beyond Richmond and Hampton Court A stronger instance I remember of Mr Townsend whose respectable family I have so frequently beforementioned he honoured me with be ng my cashier and when I mentioned wanting it as the York manager he said  "What a fool must you be Tate to trust your money with Yorkshire people for they think of nothing but to overreach us here in the south"  Another  o  vulgar Cockney wisdom I was shewn a few years ago when I was relating in London an history  with every respect and indeed blazoning ou  or  ern f  tes races c and concluding my  wi  h the ladies going to the assemblyrooms  in chairs my good sister Cockney with all the elegance of one hump before and another behind fell into an involuntary fit of laughter for which I could n t apprehend the reason but the instant her pleasant convulsions gave permission she rung the bell most furiously and called aloud  "Mr Jennings Mr Jennings come down stairscome down stairshere's Mr Wilkinson tells me the  have chairs at YorkOh I should delight to se  those horse godmothers those  wulgar  ladies get into chairs"    n ed not observe to my re  der that the lady was not of exalted breedbut is it not strange that any person of common co  prehension should let the too evident and common partiality as a Londoner prevent them from naturally knowing by yearly observation that  ondon would not be that extensiv  and rich capital it is unless supported by the resort of ladies and gentlemen from every county in the kingdom and their own reflections in August September and October should make them naturally note why in those months in particular they exclaim  "O what an empty townnobody to be seenall the world is in the country"  cOn this subject I must beg leave to intrude another instan eSome fourteen years ago I dined at the  London T vern  with a truly good friend of mine Mr Robert Bell of Hull  and a large party of his intimates resident in the metro  ol  s  t is certainly superfluous to mention that the town of Hull in the kingdom of Great Britain stands forward as a seaporttown for exports and imports and is certainly superior to any after Liverpool and  ristolThe dinner was good and Mr Bell's guests were cheerful and agreeableI was not known in my public capacity but only as a Mr Wilkinson the acquaintance of Mr Bell and my dialect conforming to my brother Cockne  s I was not supposed but as a kinsman therefore a man of knowledge being a Londoner Plays at length became a topic of conversation when Mr Bell began to pay some compliments on the good representations of which they could boast at Hull under the direction of a per  on whom he regarded and for whose prosper  he was anxious when one gentleman in particular burst into a loud laugh which was seconded by others and when sufficiently recovere  begged of Mr Bell to inform him whether they had blankets or a green cloth as a substitute for sceneryfor he never had been at a play in  he country but should like to see one of all th  gs it must be su  h a  bore  Mr Bell very grave  y repliedIf the gentleman judged it worth his att  ntion he might receive immedi  te information of every particular as the gentleman at  his right hand Mr Wilkinson was the director and patentee of the Hull theatre This immediately turned the laugh and my brother Cockney begged a thousand pardonsIt served as a very good joke and often has been related by Mr Bell as a proof how little intelligent some inconsiderate Londoners are  Titumti  is another notion that even London managers and critiques have of plays in the country but that is all exploded extravagance of manner and deviation from the truth too evidently prevailing That many great geniusses are bred in the country that a London theatre with its rod of authority and good judgment would rectify and improve is indisputableBut I am not writing or hinting of a London audience when I speak of such confirmed Cockneys within the sound of Bow bell there is here and there scattered out of London a strange set of  gnats  or wouldbemeddling officious critiques who are merely a  but  for the players when they turn their backs and are the plague of their own acquaintances with their profound knowledge and experience of the drama and deal out the word  minutiae  and  propriety  which they have gleane  superficially from theatrical phrases all pronounce  with much selfapprobation from such Sir Oracles they are much attac  ed to reviving obsolete plays  and casting and instructing the actorsI knew such a one for years and whenever I find such condescension with advancing steps approaching who if once he honours you with his advice which he means  commands  and acquaintance which lasts only whilst you implicitly bow and comply with his refined notionsbut I avoid such a gracious person as I would a pest being well confirmed from experience if he once g  ts hold of my ear or time I shall be to a certainty deprived of both  One disadvantage more to the managers of country theatres arises from the roads being so excellent to what they were formerly and the various conveniences for those in middling life as well as the affluent the increase of fashionable dissipation c are all combined causes for the ruin of country theatres  Nothing is more common than to meet an acquaintance in the York theatre on the Saturday who if asked how he liked the play will answer  "Why tolerablebut having seen it last Wednesday night so  delightfully  acted at Drury Lane it made the comedy appear very tiresome"  Mr Woodfall said Mrs Siddons spoke sensibly when she first acted Portia but that her powers were unfit for a London stage and were only calculated for such small places as she in the country  had been accustomed toMr Woodfall was no  right as it proved and Mr Woodfall I sincerel  and honourably declare I esteem as a man o  found judgment  Indeed the frequent intercourse between London and York occasioned by the facility of th  roads is a fata  ty in fact instead of an advantage for though the mind may be theatrica  i  le  s naturally to conceit vanity and selflove and it is no wonder that the London play should throw the Yorkshire one at a distance for tho' with every respect and high opinion I feel and acknowle  ge their indubitable right to preference and  uperio  ity yet I will venture to affirm that even Mr Garrick  uch is the force of prejudice would not have pleased the supersine cr  ic of York or of any other place to well had he been only a provincial actorThis assertion is  ol  but easily evincedMrs Siddons was thought a good actr  ss at York when in her prime of life but not so great an actress nor  o  lowed as the rage of the times when she was dismissed the theatre as incapable of her engagement till the Londoners recanted their former ill ju  ged decisions and as a contrary effect when most  san  oned they fainted screamed and ex red whenever  hat lady acted a few years afterwards And for the honour of country judgement  be it remembered that had they in that instance followed London example o  ten the case wh  that said London  ad lost the pleasure of seeing take her all in all the first actress within  mory  Actors are led into an error in point of dressing  servants of country gentlemen so awkwa  d  True such beings were in chara  ter eighty years ago in some bye villages some traces are  o be seen but in every country gentleman's  the servants at present are as forward fine gentlemens' gentlemen as the metropolis can boast  and most o  them have London educations and a  full as coxcombical as any Sir Harry Lord Duke or Tom which the London stage producesnor are they de  icient in the grand t  ur as very many visit  aris yearlyand Bath and Paris grow rich on Yorkshire spoils It is astonishing the number of families f  om York only now at Paris and Bath and were they not ab  entees but were according to my wishes kept in their own county it would make a jo  ful alteration in my finances and would not injure their own but happily for them they have such plenty of golden ore that they can breathe what air and in what climate they please and have a constant supply like Fortunatus's purse If I had youth and spirit and boldly trod the road neck or nothing and wished  to make depredations on Yorkshire purses I would never hazard life by attacking persons solacing in carriages who were departing  from London  particularly those of flashy gemmen and ladies for carry what cash they will into London if they have sufficient to bring them back without borrowing on the bond and without being in debt they have visited London cheaplyI mention this from my own experience but not as a good example and we are too apt to judge of others by ourselves but I dare say most will agree that they never think of going to London without a tolerably supply of metal and if they do reflect at all do not expect to return with many guineas to spare  Plays are hackneyed now in every town and villageThe theatre is not such an object for the bumpkin gazers as formerly and it is the million that must m  ke the playhouse answer Fine theatres out of London are like an easy countenance with an a  ng heartTheatres in general should  e under the controul of an actor of judgment experience goodnature c and tho' we have instances of g  e  en  f property being managers they in general have found money does not flow like a spring well though it is in truth a  sinking  one The profession in life of ease and pleasure  as it appears to be to an unthinking auditor who will say  "Well may these players be happy people they get money for nought but making game and picking folks' po  kets"  But gentlemen managers very rarely succeed though the ideal riches have tempted many to rust real ore under the rubbish and dust of wardrobes scenerooms pai  tingrooms c I know not one instance at present where any manager and actor makes a fortuneGarrick did but Colley Cibber merely retired with a competencyWilkes and Booth no moreBetterton died very poor a man it is said ever  body loved in and out of the theatre and known by courtier and peasant by the appellation of  honest Tom  that was honour indeed as an a  or and managerit is so written down in stage history and I cannot contradict itit is true he had the appellation from all who knew him of  honest Tom  but neither his genius his labour his excellence same goodness nor even his honesty had procure  him gentlemanlike existence as he had a ch  tybenefit at the age of seventyfive when he was supported on one side by Mrs Barry a fa ous actress at that time and the celebrated Mrs Bracegirdle on the other who had quitted the theatre for many years in her bloom of youth with unsullied reputation and was the admiration  of all who beheld her on or off the stageMrs Bracegirdle I believe has not been dead above twentyfive yearsher age must have been remarkableShe was well born and brought on the stage by Mr Betterton was I believe the original Statira and in most of Rowe's tragedies Mrs Pritchard shewed me her part of Clarissa in the Confederacy which was written out by Mrs Bracegirdle's own hand they were acquainted and Mrs Pritchard told me that venerable actress came there on purpose to see her act Mrs Oakley in the Jealous  ife during its first run  The advantages I have mentioned the London theatres flourish with at present are not all confined to what I have asserted as to the theatres dresses scenery and many accommodations but there is no alteration better than the stage in these days not being infested with persons behind the scenes in common but particularly on benefit nightsAs a proof of the force of absurdity I have often wondered and so have others why new stage boxes placed where the useful stage doors used to be were frequented but in short there are persons always who would prefer such a box were it much higher on the stage so few want really to see the piece attentivelyWitness ladies of fashion in London thirty years ago sitting at the very backs of the performers  When I had the honour at York to wait upon his Royal Highness the late Duke of York he said  "Wilkinson where am I to sit"I replied "In the stage box" At which he smiled and said "So because I am the Duke of York I must sit in the worst box in the theatre for seeing the play"  The theatres formerly were not large enough on such occasions as frequently on the benefit of a Woodward a Mrs Cibber a Shuter and others was the case therefore the following advertisement appeared at the bottom of each playbill on any benefit of consequence  "Part of the pit will be railed into the boxes and for the better accommodation of the ladies the stage will be formed into an amphitheatre where servants will be allowed to keep places"  When a great house was not sufficiently ascertained as the perfo  mer ju  ged for the places taken and the tickets sold at the bottom of the bill was  "  N B  Not  y building on the stage"  What was termed  building  on the stage certainly was the greatest nu  sance that ever prevailed over an entertainment for the elegant and general resort of any metropolis Yet London has not stood singular as its rival city and seat of elegance and fashion Paris had formerly the same defects if we who have not been there may guess a few years  agoif credit is to be given to the authority of Mr Foote's Englishman in Paris  "We saw crowds of people going into a house and comedy pasted over the door in we trooped with the rest paid our cash and sat down on the stage Presentl  they had a dance and one of the young women with long hair trailing behind her stood with her back to a rail just by meEcod what does me for nothing in the world but a joke as I hope for mercy but ties her locks to the rail so when it was her turn to figure out souse she flapped on her ba  k'Twas devilish comical"  Custom reconciles many things in every stage of life and though it was the most irksome to a performer that ever could be inflicted as a punishment the slavery of course was made easy to the persons whose benefit it was that occasioned the confusion the perquisite being always prevailing and if Mr Shuter was proud that the superflux was compliment to his wonderful abilities Conscience would gain acquiescence to undertake the labouring oar for a brother or sister performer as mutual lab urers in the vineyard  But my kind reader suppose an audience behind the curtain up to the clouds with persons of a menial cast on the ground beaux and no beaux crowding the only entrance what a play it must have been whenever Romeo was breaking open  the supposed tomb which was no more than a screen on those nights set up and Mrs Cibber prostrating herself on an old couch covered with black cloth as the tomb of the Capulets with at least on a great benefit night two hundred persons behind her which for  ed the back ground as an unfrequented hallowed place of  chaplels  skulls which was to convey the idea of where the heads of all her buried ancestors were packed  I do not think at present any allowance but peals of laughter could attend such a truly ridiculous spectacleYet strange as it would now seem and insu  terable yet certain it is that I have seen occasionally many plays acted with great applause to such mummery as to general appearance and conception A strange proof and the strongest I think that can be given how far a mind may be led by attention custom and a willingness to be pleased without the least aid of probability its chief and sole object certainly tended only to create laughter and disgust Nay the stage which was not thirty years ago near so wide as at present also the stagedoors which must be well remembered and the stageboxes before which there were false canvas  nclosed fronts on each side of two or three seats on to the lamps for ladies of distinction which rendered it next to impossible for those ladies in the stageboxes to see at all but still it was the fashion  and therefore of course charming and delightfuland whenever a Don Choleric in the Fop's Fortune or Sir Amorous Varnict in Woman's a Riddle or Charles in the Busy Body tried to find out secrets or plot an escape from a balcony they always bowed and thrust themselves into the boxes over the stagedoor amidst the company who were greatly disturbed and obliged to give up their seats  The actor talked of being alone amongst hundreds and Sir Amorous hung in a sling with Mrs Betty adding to the inconvenience These were faults indeed and almost beyond belief within these forty years even with all the knowledge of the Bettertons Cibbers Booths and Wilks to have cleared the way and not have left such passages of the Drama to be corrected which their own honour and common sense might so easily have removed and expunged from their journals of disgrace as they must now remain a lasting stigma on their taste a  d judgment  To add instances of equal absurdity in the country would be superfluou  and afford no wonder at allThe bod  of course was ill when the great mind was overpowered with sickness debility and disorderMr Garrick was a doctor but too late to cure this evil at his setting forthbetter however late than never but he  only  remedied the disease for the advantage of the train of actors that followed him more than for any long enjoyment that it afforded to his own pride and satisfaction as the projector or as the entire expunger and exterminator of those horrid intrusions on the mind of sensibility Besides these troubles and inconveniences not even those of the first theatrical rank could be insured or protected from insult yet to this real drudgery mortification degradation and humiliation I have often seen Mr Garrick and Mrs Cibber exposed I can well remember when I was thirteen years of age viewing Mr Quin on Monday March for the benefit of Mr Ryan play the character of Falstaff He was thus announced in the playbill  "The part of Falstaff WILL be performed by Mr QUIN"  Which was his last night of performingThe Stage was at sPit and Boxes all joined together at s There was only one entrance on each side the stage which was always particularly crowded First they sported their own figures to gratify self consequence and impede and interfere with the performers who had to come on and go off the stage Affronting the audience was another darling delightparticularly offending the galleries and thereby incurring the displeasure  of the gods who shewed their resentment by dispersing golden showers of oranges and halfeaten p  ppins to the infinite terror of the ladies of fashion seated in the pit on such public nights where they were so closely wedged as to preclude all possibility of securing a retreat or obtaining reliet till the  fina  e  when they all moved from their situation by general consent  The stage spectators were not content with piling on raised seats till their heads reached the theatrical cloudings which seats were clo  ed in with dirty worn out scenery to inclose the painted round from the first wing the main  entrance  being up steps from the middle of the  back scene  but when that amphitheatre was filled there would be a group of ill dressed lads and p rsons  itting on the stage in front three or four rows deep other  e those who sat behind could not have seen and a riot would have ensued So in fact a performer on a popular night could not step his foot with safety least  e either should thereby hurt or offend or be thrown down amongst scores of idle tipsey apprentices  The first time Holland acted Hamlet it was for his own benefit when the stage was in the situation here described On seeing the Ghost he was much frightened and felt the sensation and terror usual on that thrilling occasion and his hat flew    amode  off his head An inoffensive woman in a red cloak a friend of Holland's hearing Hamlet complain the air bit shrewdly and was very  old with infinite composure crossed the stage took up the hat and with the greatest care placed it  st on Hamlet's head who on the occasion was as much alarmed in  reality  as he had just then been  eigning But the audience burst out into such incessant peals of laughter that the Ghost moved off without any ceremony and Hamlet scorning to be outdone in courtesy immediately followed with roars of applause The poor woman stood astonished which increased the roar c It was some time before the laughter subsided and they could not resist a repetition that merry tragedy night on the reappearance of the Ghost and Hamlet  Mr Quin aged sixtyfive with the heavy dress of  alstaff notwithstanding the impatience of  he audience to see their old acquaintance was several minutes before he could pass through the numbers that wedged and hemmed him in he was so cruelly encompassed aroundWhat must the reader suppose at so barbarous and general a  st  m being not only yielded to but approved by the p  rformersMrs Cibber arrayed for Juliet in a  white satin dress with the then indispensable  rge hoop in all her pomp of woe thus shaken  and taken prisoner as it were by foes sarcastic an  bar  arous And in these situations they under went greater aff  ctions of punis  ment and tyran  than  ver the Mrs Pritchard or Woffington experienced as an Arpa  ia or a Merope from a Bajazet or  pliont  s  Now Mr Garrick acutely felt this horrid in convenience for th  u  h the actor might re  o  ci  e th  se offensive and degrading situations for  additional hundre  pounds profit yet as Mr Garrick on su  occasi  ns had n  t a fellow  eeling it was therefore to  him  more irksome Th  pu lic truly knew and felt the inconvenience b  this was  heerfully submitte  to They the  considered it as a reward to the  av  urite actor fo  his yearly lab  ur toil and industry but it may ea  i y be supp s  d that many lovers of the Dram  dep  ed themselves from seeing a play so disgraceful  y ac  d on such occas  ons however well such pe so  s might wish the performers But at th  same time they consulted their own ease and comfort by absenting themselves on such nights Ye  such is the force of true good sterling acting that I do aver I have seen on very particular occasions when the stage has not been  too much  crowded a play performed with universal approbation  Mr Foote's first night of the Englishman in Paris for Mr Macklin's benefit stood the hazard  of the die under the disadvantage of this predicam  nt Its value was stamped that night and a great run and establishment it met with the winter follow  ng Mr Garrick's Lord Chalkstone the  A pr  of what good acting humoured with  and candour will produce and the  when not interrupted on such benefit nights  in lieu surrounded by a wellbred set of ladies  nd  entlemen have felt themselves so much at ease  specimens of goodluck for it could be  to nothing else that they have gloried in  he unexpected luxury of comfort and encourage  e  t with which they have been so fortunately re  ved and they have acted as well as if surro  d  d by their usual slaves and attendants with the addi  ion of s cenery c to have ai  ed their ex  ons  At the time this beargarden flourished in our th  tres whenever on the managers' nights the  overflowed in the winter season not only their acquaintance but persons of distinction and  were indiscriminately admitted behind the  n  s particularly at DruryLane on the nights Mr Garrick acted his first esteemed characters of  Lear Bayes c but I have often seen  distre  ed on such nights At CoventGarden  e same rude custom was prevalent but not un  e  s on very rare occasions were they so much disturbed  with such visitors The boxes at that theatre did not so often groan with the overpowering numbers unless when one of Rich's rareesh  ws was revived as Harlequin Sorcerer in particular when the following paragraph was inserted at the bottom of the bill  "As any obstructions in the movements of the machinery will greatly prejudice the performance of the entertainment it is hoped that no gentlemen will take it a  ss the being refused admittance behind the scenes"  "Ladies are requested to send their servants by three o'clock"  And if the performers at either house on a benefit were moderate in their exactions or hopes from the town they cheered their wellwishers with placing the following line conspicuous  "N B There will not be any building on the stage"  When Rich after two or three years' promise and delay brought forth one of these longwishedfor pantomimes it was a rage a madness incredible seized all the Londoners On such fortunate occurrences Mr Rich was strongly attached and tenderly tenacious of his harlequin jacket being prophaned or infringed upon and kept his holy rites and mysteries of serpents lions druids c sacred from the inspection of all curious  p  ying inspectors Nor would he have had his magical sword interrupted or his fountains and cascades stopped in their munificent flow to the admiring and astonished crowds in front to have pleased all the nobility in the kingdom And indeed the difference of performing pantomimes under Mr Rich's direction and skill was as much superior at that time as was Mr Garrick's Hamlet at DruryLane compared to old Ryan's at CoventGarden  The constant admission behind the scenes is no where more fully or better explained than by Mr Garrick in the farce of Lethe acted first at Goodman's Fields where he makes the Fine Gentleman thus express himself  Aesop  How do you spend your evening Sir  Fine Gent  I dress in the evening and go generally behind the scenes of both playhouses not you may imagine to be diverted with the play but to intrigue and shew myself I stand upon the stage talk loud and stare about which confounds the actors and disturbs the audience upon which the galleries who hate the appearance of one of us begin to hiss and cry Off off while I undaunted stamp my foot sololl with my shoulder thustake snuff with my right hand and smile scornfullythusThis exasperates the savages and they attack us  with vollies of sucked oranges and halfeaten pippens  Aesop  And you retire  Fine Gent  Without doubt if I am sober for orange will stain silk and an apple disfigu  e a feature  This is a proof that Garrick saw and felt the evil in his younger days and he at last mustered courage by one bold stroke to put the hatchet to the tree and thereby annihilate the grievance and tho' he had undergone these hardships and inconveniences for many years with the utmost severity and patience yet he judged it a reformation due to his future name and fame And I may observe it is not always seen that muchwishedfor alterations even in affairs of the utmost moment are in general approved or willingly submitted to by the million with whom no reason or argument will or can convince or wear off ancient customs and preju  ices  As Mr Garrick had three parties to encounter and each formidab  e when bundled they were truly alarming First to banish the young beaux from behind the scene was judged a daring attempt though Mr Sheridan had proved it was to be done in Dublin where the behaviour sometimes had been mentioned as  most savage  as the manager's right to rule where young men of ton  we  e concerned was looked upon as a vulgar law w  h none but the mean spirited obeyed The  o  r order were attached to it as going behind the  cenes on benefit nights pleased young clerks  nd others who liked to see the a  resses nearer  han t  ey were accustomed to also most of the pr  ipal and several of the middling class of the per  ormers would not choose to pay Mr Garrick's ch  rges for their benefit nights and be abridged o  a  l or a l advantage accruing from the  uilding and general admittance on the stage  Garrick did not like the obstacles he had to encounter till a lucky thought burst in upon his  concerning that business He reflected t  at the theatre was but in an indifferent state a  d that by enlarging it to the now present fo  m it would not only immediately answe  for his pecuniary advantages but also for a pub  c theatrical property which he meant in four or  ive years after that to part with to the best  as was the case when Doctor Ford Mr Sheridan and Mr Linley were the purchasers a he grew harassed and had secured affluence in an o  er abundance Which makes it lamentable to  sider how short a time he enjoyed a private  for he was snatched from his friends and all h  s w  rldly wealth in about two years after his  age farewell  However his projected plan he put in practice altered the Old DruryLane into its present form which now holds considerably above l in front more than it did thirty years ago and after this beneficial alteration was accomplished by degrees all parties were pleased and convinced of its propriety The comedians had particular reasons to jump for joy as they received the same benefit emoluments without those degrading and irksome situations which interest had made them submit to The CoventGarden managers adopted the same change of measures and from that time general admittance and stage building on benefits has ever been prohibited  These stage remarks have carried my memory back to recollect that the same evils existed in provincial theatres and in a worse degree as those stages not being formed into an amphitheatre were without any order or decency merely rows of forms one level with the other for the audience part of those theatres were full large for their usual seasons of acting yet on particular benefits London furnished a plea for what might be attempted to render the bad playhouses worse than they were before And the alterations in this respect from Mr Garrick's reformation of abuses in London I should apprehend  led into the sudden wonderful improvements enlargements and aggrandizing of most of our theatres in every principal town and city  And as to the article of being freed from beaux behind the scenes a greater blessing could not be wished or more devoutly prayed for as it cannot be conceived how dreadful in the country that would sometimes prove my own situation in my history mentioned at Shrewsbury is one instance the hauteur and dignity of such visitants being often so insulting and imperious as not to be described  The receipts of the theatres it is true should be mentioned In two hundred pounds before the curtain at CoventGarden was judged an amazing sum Now we hear of upwards of four hundred pounds but the profits of the season I dare pronounce are not equal to Mr Garrick's reign the expences are grown so enormous  At Dublin in one hundred and fifty pounds was a great house indeed In one hundred and eighty pounds at CrowStreet was ju  ged a wonder but with the late alterations Mr Daly had in July  three hundred and twentyfour pounds and he mentions hundreds that could not obtain admittance  Mr Garrick was certainly formed to obtain favourand the public in general willingly subscribed to his proposals though like man and wife they sometimes did not agreeHis coffers were always full and he was too great an oeconomist  ver to empty them by the hand of extravagancehe locked on his Majesty's picture with love and reverence and never parted with his King's likene  s but with the greatest relu anceThe expences of the house were not then so great as at present for when I had a benefit at Covent Garden I only paid l now I believe performers pay l and if Mrs Jordan acts on that benefit it is ten guineas more  It is worthy remark that with all the boasted improvements certainly the goings out are immense in proportion to the comings in and where there was one place open against the theatres then now there are doublesuch as various newestablished concerts at HanoverSquare  ottenhamCourt Pantheon besides Astley's the Circus c therefore with the London managers being at double the expence of their predecessors I can never coincide with the opinions started by dissatisfied performers or as o  ten hinted at in the news papers But let us ask is there a superfluity of principal actors Certainly no Are the managers in great  circumstances Certainly no One play got up now will cost more than three would fifty years ago I have heard great arguments of what encouragement would be given by a third theatre instead of the present termed monopoly Were it possible to create three industrious Mr Sheridans to write for the stage something might be said and done but I fear not otherwise and if people in general find their plays not all perfection with two companies I cannot conceive that divided into three the  would be acted betterNay is not Mr Harris reduced I say reduced or he certainly w  uld not do it to cut plays into farces and give farces instead of plays and sometimes all farce and no play with different  boxers  Mendoza and Humphreys on the stage for the entertainment of the first audience in the world in which he has  ulfilled Garrick's prophecy for the theatre royal at Covent Garden gives a dish of all sorts And were they twenty years since to have seen  medley playbills at a third theatre or from York or Edinburgh such stuff would have served the whole greenroom in London for a week's laugh at the country strollers' expenceB  si  es such productions if to be tolerated and approved at all should certainly be permitted only  a summer theatre when the wine and the wea  her is hot  GARRICK's PROPHECY  Perhaps for who can guess the effects of chance  Here Hunt may box and Mahomet may dance  Ah let not censure term our fate our choice  The stage but echoes back the public voice  As to gentlemen writers of genius being excluded from having their works produced I cannot think the injustice alledged is by any means founded on truth or equit  for I never can believe even tho' many good plays were to be sunk in oblivion but that some of them would again visit the world in print to gratify the author's pride and reputation and by such means prove how indifferent managers were to meritI do not mean to insinuate that there are not good authors at present capable of affording the highest and most improving additions to the stage catalogue I only wish to be understood that the stage is not overstocked with such offers and it is too probable that authors may have occasion perhaps to complain of indifferent and improper treatment as a London manager is not like the Pope a ways infallible I am only speaking by guess not being a quainted with the facts It is certain the new pieces brought out in a general  way do not please and as money is always welcome I cannot think any projector existing would be at great expence to produce a piece that creates confusion in the theatre damnation to the author a  d if persisted in he excludes the possibility of crowded houses besides being well abused in every public print into the bargain I cannot t  ink Mr Harris would lavish money on the Prophetess if he had as good a new opera to produce as the Duenna the very run of such a piece as the latter would supply him for half the seas n or that Mr Kemble would produce a comedy only acted three nights if he had been presented with one equal to the School for Scandal And indeed how few plays of late seasons reach the ninth night What a quantity of plays farces and pantomimes do the three theatres exhibit in the course of the year and how few succeed What perpetual labour and anxiety mu  t the performers undergo and all end in vexation of spiritall for nothingsome few pieces excepted which need not be enumerated as those that live and are the oftenest acted prove their public estimation One great fault has crept into the benefit bills in London filling them up with such a quantity of interludes cI am sorry to observe Mr Garrick was the introducerhe led  the way to what has grown to an enormous height but I am certain he never meant the ill effects it has established But his Farmer's Return Linco's Travels c wrote as interludes have considerably lessened the dignity of the drama It was the practice at my own theatres I at first on benefit nights insisted on all interludes being done as afterludes but nothing would do so as to keep the playbills  it to be seen they were so loaded with trumpe  y so for some years past I have not had any preludes interludes or afterludes at all Mr Kemble wished on his night in August at York to introduce the Toy Shop as an interlude which he had formerly done and which gave great satisfaction on account of his excellent performance of the Master but unless he took it as a farce I was compelled not to suffer it on account of my established law which Mr Kemble at the head of the profession breaking through would have set aside  uc  law by the example from his high authority and judgment I remember his reply was  "That the act was good it kept in force but" added he jokingly "Mr Wilkinson the first benefit bi  I shall  ee o  your own night I shall find it full of interludes"  However it has not happened yet and I dare say never will to any benefit of mine  London opinion though its stamp passes current in provincial towns as to firstrate performers yet has so fallen in reputation as to pieces that it is not a recommendation in advertising a new play but the contrary and many are never attempted So that there is no wish to see a new production unless much spoken of and it has fortunately had a very considerable run but even that was not always secure its footing I have great obligations to acknowledge to the School for Scandal the Poor Soldier and the Farmer of modern date  As I have given an account of the amazing alterations as to the manners practised in the theatres not much longer ago than our  prime yet so quick is the transition that a few only remain now who can affirm or contradict what I have inserted A proof how we are  eceived by the apparent slowness of the running sand in the hourglass which in reality  astonishing rapidity and wafts us dreaming from life to  dusty  death This is verified  in the course of these last forty years few are left to mock their own grinningtho' Mr Macklin stands firm like the venerable old oak that shades the forestand in the following Tablet it affects me as if it were the history of a theatrical cathedral which  gives an account of the departed dead or a transient view of the acter's tombs and monuments  Now good gentleman or lady I will proceed and introduce the  Actor's Tablet  It is a tale told by an idiot  Full of sound and fury signifying nothing  THIS Repository or Journal is offered not only to young stage candidates but at the same time to the attention of all amateurs of the Drama as it will be a guide and a more regular information to them and indeed to the public in general than any thing of the kind yet attemptedthough I fear presented in a bungling manner Still this account of old stagers must be in some degree venerable as an old coin is in higher esteem with antiquarians than the new though of less intrinsic worthI wish it had the advantage of a better head but that is past praying for yet it will be a kind of guide and convey information by no means publicly known wherein the reader will find almost an exact list of every theatrical event with the date of most of the new or revived plays and farces producedthe performers' engagements and  desertions to and from Ireland to the London Theatrestheir reengagements and the account of singers dancers burlettas incidents c from the year to the conclusion of  Mr Garrick's establishment as joint manager with Mr Lacey was in and few persons who have been readers of theatrical anecdotes have y  t since the time of Colley Cibber had any accurate or regular account of those years more than in a general view though there certainly has been able writers and men of genius who have treated on more important theatrical subjects  I will here give a list of the companies at DruryLane and CoventGarden in that the observant reader unprejudiced may see what a number of established actors were at that period in one company and whether there are the same number of  equal eminence  to be called so at present at either Theatre  The modern critic and actor will undoubtedly admit that every fifty years will make havock and considerable alteration and what is approved and applauded now may not be sanctioned in  When Mr Garrick undertook the mana  ement the company collected was perhaps take it for all in all the most powerful ever mustered in the present century  I will first give as correct a list as I can recollect then present the cast of two or three plays and then instance the cast of the same plays in by which means the unprejudiced reflector may draw a fair conclusion and perhaps allow it not quite improbable but the play so acted might have been seen with equal pleasure then as now  DRURYLANE THEATRE  MEN  Messrs Garrick Barry Delane Macklin Sparks Berry Yates

then very stale one of Merlin's Cave or Harlequin Skeleton They played in general only three or four times in the week in January and often dismissed even in the month of February for Garrick had

DAPHNE which drew good housesHarlequin Mr PHILLIPS who supplied that character as Mr Rich's substitute when he did not choose to perform as Mr Lun The scene of the sun rising had a fine effect and I am astonished so superb a constructed piece of machinery is not made use of now at CoventGarden as introductory to some new pantomime For the scene with Morpheus Mystery and Slumber preparatory to the appearance of the sun in its meridian had a wonderful effect and might be displayed in any other pantomime and be a good opening one Also that of Daphne's being turned into a tree by the pursuit of Apollo from the assenting nod of Silenus the rising Dome the Lion in Perseus the Snake c would make good incidents  In the Spring was a remarkable an  dreadful fire in Cornhill when Mr Quin came purposely from Bath and acted his favourite character of Cato at CoventGarden theatre for the benefit of the poor sufferers by that dreadful conflagration  DruryLane season Mr Macklin and wife quitted DruryLane for Ireland Woodward returned to the old house from Dublin and soon gr  w into amazing popularity This year was revived  ROMEO and JULIET  Romeo  Mr BARRY  Mercutio  Mr WOODWARD  Juliet  Mrs CIBBER  The play had a remarkable run Mr Victor has not taken notice of this circumstance for the strength of that play was the foundation for the desertion of Mr Barry in the year with Mrs Cibber  Irene by Doctor Johnson was acted that season Also Lethe which was inimitably performed not a part but was truly excellent Merop  was acted that year Garrick looked and acte  like an angel as the ladies said the part o Eumenes  Mr Lee and Mr Palmer promising actor  were introduced that season  The same year the Emperor of the Moon written by Mrs Behn was revived at Drurylane as a second pieceHarlequin was tossed in a  lanket with a good effecthe had two long slips  y which he heldthey were imperceptible to the a  ience So that Harlequin seemed to the eye  violently tumbled and the galleries who  the appearance of mischief were vastly    That season Mr King made his first attempt as  candidate in the Herald in King Lear his  was not paid any attention to by Mr Gar  ck he was as is theatrically termed laid up  the shelf that year but he was engaged for the  season at Bristol where Mr Whitehead  e Poet Laureat and Mrs Pritchard saw  play the character of Romeo with great ap  ause He returned to London the winter sea  and was astonished without any notice  given him to see his name in large let  s advertised for George BarnwellMillwood  rs  ritchardHe also played Valerius in Mr  h  tehead's Tragedy of the Roman Father  e continued there till the end of the season  the autumn went over to Ireland and ac  ed a very liberal offer from Mr Sheridan  Dublin he continued till the second year after  r Woodward's desertion from Drury Lane to  wstreet Theatre in Dublin  Mr King returned to fill up Mr Woodward  department and made his first appearance early i  October in the character of Tom in th  Conscious Lovers his second part was Atall an  his third Sir Amorous VainwitIn the characte of Brass Churchill allowed him great merit  The Play Friendship in Fashion was attempte  to be played in the spring Mr Woodwar  and Mrs Clive were to sustain the principal charactersBe it noticed Dame Clive was no blessed with beautythough of infinite talents ye she unfortunately in that Comedy was ideally ravished twice or thrice before the fourth act ended whic  the audience very properly judged to be too muc  for that lady's feelings and not knowing wha  might truly happen in the fifth they consequentl  put a violent and final stop to all farther indecen  proceedings  The French ambassador was at the play an  seemed to enjoy John Bull engaged in a riot Bu  at last violation was offered to the King's arms ove  the front box at which he seemed much alarme  at the imagined sacrilege and precipitately retire  from the theatreWhat an alteration in th  conduct of Frenchmen in forty years  My true respect duty and veneration to hi  Majesty leads me to hope that no similar acciden  will ever occur at York on any occasion as I can b  ast the best finished and most elegant  royal arms  for neatness and perfection as to workmanship of any theatre in his Majesty's dominionsAll surpri  e at this assertion will cease in Yorkshire when I anounce they were executed by those ingenious and wellknown artists the deserving brothers John and Samuel Fisher of York  COVENTGARDEN  Several theatrical alterations took placeMr Rich was roused from his slumberMr Quin returned to the stage and Mr Delane Mr Sparks Mr Arthur Mrs Woffington and Miss Pitt were engaged from DruryLane also Miss Bellamy by Mr Victor and others falsely related to have been drawn from her lucrative and splendid s tuation in Dublin by Garrick was actually  ngaged by Mr Rich  Mrs Bellamy's first appearance was in Belvi  ra which proves Mr Victor's account of Covent Garden very erroneous  "Mr Garrick says Mr Victor and Mr Hitchcock from the many opportunities he had of seeing Miss Bellamy's abilities when they performed together in  Dublin was too well convinced of her merit not to use every means to engage herAccordingly he made her proposals which she immediately accepted and she returned to London where she remained some years in high estimation"  That Mrs Bellamy remained for some time in high estimation is well knownbut her first appearance after her departure from Dublin was not at Mr Garrick's theatre but at Coventgarden as before mentioned a true and particular account of which with Mr Garrick's  refusal  to engage her is given in her Memoirs  Mrs Ward was also engagedshe was a handsome woman and a good actress  Coriolanus by Thompson was produced that season in which Mr Quin Mr Ryan Mr Delane Mr Sparks Mr Ridout Mrs Bellamy and Mrs Wo  ington acted  Perseus and Andromeda was also produced and brought several housesso that Mr Rich then had three pantomimes on the stocks the Skeleton Apollo and Daphne and Perseus The business of the  petit maitre  in the last mentioned was inimitably done by Mr Lalmaze palpably stolen by Mr Woodward and placed in Queen Mab at Drury Lane in the year The scene of the  Dragon and Perseus on his flying horse with Andromeda chained to the rock the rising Dome and the Lion were the principal parts of that entertainment and all done well as was all pantomime business under the direction of Mr Rich  Mr Arthur did the clown in that pantomime in which department he was unrivalled and well understood all the  mechanical  parts of those kind of productionsMr Lowe was Perseus Mr Miles Harlequin Miss Falkener AndromedaMr Quin's Falstaff and several of his characters drew great audiencesMrs Bellamy was much esteemedMrs Woffington was attractive in Sir Harry Wildair cand though DruryLane was fashionable yet CoventGarden was respectable as to entertainment and in general well attended  JANE SHORE was thus cast  Glo'ster  Mr QUIN  Hastings  Mr DELANE  Dumont  Mr RYAN  Alicia  Miss BELLAMY  Jane Shore  Mrs WOFFINGTON  The entertainments of the theatre were in  sed by the addition of two excellent dancers  Mr Cooke and Miss HilliardA Scotch danc  was so pleasing that it continued not only tha  but three or four seasons after  This was the year of the quartbottle conjuror at the Haymarket where the joke drew such  concourse at the expence of John Bull  turned out advantageous to the proprietor of CoventGarden as at the latter part of that season Harlequin to the amazement of crowded audiences not only went into the quart bottle but after that Don Jumpedo jumped down his own throatThese exploits were performed by Harlequin Phillips  The Provoked Wife was acted with approbation that season at Coventgarden for though Garrick was then performing Sir John Brute yet there were many obstinate critics of opinion that the character was better conducted by Mr Quin Indeed there cannot be any one part acted more differently than that character was by Mr Garrick and Mr Quin Yet had the author been then living I may venture to pronounce he would have allowed both right Even the petticoat scene was as opposite in dress and manner as Othello and Desde+mona Yet had Mr Quin attempted Garrick'  mode or Garrick Quin's each would have certainly failed  The play was thus cast at CoventGarden  Brute  Mr QUIN  Heartfree  Mr RYAN  Constant  Mr RIDOUT  Razor  Mr ANDERSON  Colonel Bully  Mr LOWE  Taylor  Mr COLLINS  Belinda  Mrs HALE  Mademoiselle  Miss MORRISON  Who played it inimitably  Lady Fanciful  Miss BELLAMY  Lady Brute  Mrs WOFFINGTON  In the spring Cato was acted by order of  is Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales by the younger branches of the Royal FamilyHis present Majesty spoke the prologue at LeicesterHouse on the occasion The conducting of the performance was entirely under the direction of Mr Quin His present Majesty's father was a great advo  ate for the stage and a warm patron of Mr Quin's Indeed his attachment was such that Quin's salary was equal to a thousand pounds his  t season One political reason was that a  the commands of his Royal Highness unless on so  e very particular occasion Covent Garden  theatre was honoured with and chiefly out o  compliment to Mr Quin  The Emperor of the Moon wrote by Mrs Behn was revived at Covent Garden as a first piece and at some expence A tapestry scene of figures was very well executedDoctor Bellardo by Mr Sparks Harlequin Mr Cushing Scaramouch Mr DunstallMiss Bellamy Mrs Woffington and Mrs Ward were in it but the piece did not succeed and Harlequin is the fiddle of the piece Mr Woodward must have been excellent and Mr Cushing contemptible I recollect seeing it as a farce but very wretchedly supported as to decorations scenery c in Dublin where Mr King was truly whimsical in Harlequin  The following comedies were thus cast and acted with success at Covent Garden that season  CONSTANT COUPLE  Sir Harry Wildair  Mrs WOFFINGTON  Standard  Mr DELANE  Vizard  Mr RIDOUT  Beau Clincher  Mr CIBBER  Young Clincher  Mr COLLINS  Smuggler  Mr ARTHUR  Tom Errand  Mr BENCRAFT  Angelica  Miss COPIN  Lady Darling  Mrs COPIN  Parly  Mrs DUNSTALL  Lady Lovewell  Mrs WARD  CARELESS HUSBAND  Lord Foppington  Mr CIBBER  Sir Charles Easy  Mr RYAN  Lord Morelove  Mr DELANE  Lady Easy  Mrs WARD  Edging  Mrs RIDOUT  Lady Graveairs  Mrs HALE  Lady Betty Modish  Mrs WOFFINGTON  The season concluded with the Constant Couple and Apollo and Daphne  DRURY LANE  Mrs Cibber did not play That season Mr Garrick shameful to relate encouraged Mrs Ward to break articles with Mr Rich which she was the easier tempted to do as Miss Bellamy was in possession of most of the characters she wished to play Edward the Black Prince was acted that seasonBarry gained great ground and honour in Ribemont Master Mattocks appeared that year in the Chaplet a very pretty entertainment at that timeMusical pieces then  King Arthur and the Tempest excepted were on our English stage confined to the common ballad farcesMr Beard was as a vocal performer the best actor of SONGS I ever rememberMiss Norris was a charming singerand Pastora cannot be known but by those who had the pleasure of seeing Mrs Clive  Mrs Cibber having withdrawn was a severe stroke upon the Drury Lane tragedies Mrs Ward being but a cold and inanimate substitute and it fell heavier on Mr Barry's plays than Mr Garrick's as Lear Macbeth Richard with Mrs Pritchard's Lady Macbeth c would do without Mrs Cibber but Castalio Romeo Varanes c were ruined without her helping hand Indeed Barry refused acting Romeo with Mrs Ward The Roman Father was brought out that season where Barry in Publius by no means could appear as an actor though it shewed his fine figure in competition with Garrick Gil Blas was produced that year and damned and some other pieces but none of note Rich not having any thing new and only repeating the old plays Lady Jane Gray excepted and the pantomime of the Fair Drury Lane unless on particular nights bore the beil Garrick's comedy characters as well as his tragedy such as Ranger Benedick  Archer Bayes Lear Hamlet c were sure cards and all those plays were thoroughly well acted  COVENT GARDEN  The company much the same as the year before unless the loss of Mr Theophilus Cibber Mr Dyer from Ireland was his substitute a very good actor in sprightly comedy not striking as to abilities but sure to please and never to offend He played several parts of Mr Garrick's such as Ranger c and in Tom was truly excellentthat was his first part at Covent Garden Mr Dyer's figure was very neat not unlike that of Mr Lewis's of Covent Garden but it would be paying Mr Lewis a very bad complement to draw a comparison in any other respect as that gentleman's vivacity neatness spirit and energy of expression is so superior as to cast Mr Dyer's abilities at a distance were he now living as wherever Mr Lewis's Vapid Twineall Mercutio c are ment oned which he supports with a peculiar whim and vivacity he by that means sends hundreds joyful to their respective homes In truth he needs no eulogium as the truest praise is deservedly thus that whether Mr Lewis had pleased the audience in or in he would have an equal claim to the generosity protection  and approbation of a sensible generous and discerning public  Garrick's reasoning in verse will explain that idea when perhaps I should only perplex  Your children cannot feel what you have known  They'll boast of Quins and Cibbers of their own  The greatest glory of our happy few  Is to be felt and be approv'd by you  Lady Jane Gray was revived by command of his Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales as a second performance by the Royal Family under the direction of Mr Quin at Leicester House It added much to Mrs Woffington's reputation The parts were thus disposed of  Pembroke  Mr DELANE  Northumberland  Mr SPARKS  Suffolk  Mr RIDOUT  Gardiner  Mr QUIN  Duchess of Suffolk  Mrs HORTON  Lady Jane Gray  Mrs WOFFINGTON  The above play was performed a number of nights The line of  I hold no speech with hereticks and traitors  used to strike my young imagination so forcibly at ten years old that I remember it  perfectly  to this very minute  That year Mr Rich produced a little sketch of a pantomime called the Fair in which Mr Lun Rich did Harlequin Lun had been the name of the famous man who represented Harlequin at Paris therefore whenever Mr Rich appeared as Harlequin the name of Lun was inserted in the bil  s Mr Garrick paid a compliment to Mr Rich's Harlequin in the following lines  But why a speaking Harlequin 'tis wrong  The wits will say to give the fool a tongue  When LUN appear'd with matchless art and whim  He gave the pow'r of speech to ev'ry limb  Tho' mask'd and mute convey'd his quick intent▪  And told in frolic gestures all he meant  But now the motley coat and sword of wood  Requires a tongue to make them understood  The famous Turk on the wire was at that time introduced by Mr Rich in the pantomime of the Fair and indeed that was the sole motive of his patching up that entertainment Mr Quin and Mrs Woffington would not play during the representation of that piece as they thought it degrading to the theatre to have wiredancers c but as it did not interfere with their plays and they were paid and as that trifle brought several good houses by which means they would have appeared to advantage they certainly acted wrong  in duty to the manager the public and their own intere  tThe public were the only proper judges to decide on the propriety or impropriety and if THEY suffered the Grand Turk to exhibit they should have acquiesced and not withdrawn and pointed out the fault which might have worked up a fury against the theatre that would have fallen upon themselves  Romeo and Juliet was revived in the interim between Quin and Woffington's playingRomeo Mr Lee Juliet Miss Bellamy Mr Lee had broke his article and fled to Covent GardenMr Lee's very peculiar oddity of temper prevented him ever rising to any fixed public estimation  DRURY LANE  Miss Bellamy was engaged from Covent Garden and trained as the JulietWoodward was the Mercutio Mr Garrick divided the opinion of the town as to his performance in RomeoMr Rich's procession was very grand and in those spectacles he never had been equalled nor can be surpassed but Garrick did not promise any procession or dirge in his bills tho' they gave a striking effect and an agreeable surpriseMr Woodward assisted Mr Garrick with Queen Mab  that season which eased Garrick much and the comedies were so well sustained where Mr Woodward Mr Yates Mr Taswell Mrs Pritchard and Mrs Clive were capital that the fairy wand sailed with the old Drury hulk before the wind A whimsical print was then produced called the Steel Yards in in which were placed Quin Barry Woffington and Cibber and in opposition Woodward and Queen Mab which exultingly bore down all the greater load with the small This season Mr Shuter was coming forward greatly as a low comedian at Drury Lanealso Mr Palmer in the gentlemen in comedy who afterwards sustained a very consid  rable cast of the celebrated Mr Wilkes's comedygentlemen as Sir George Airy cHe some years afterwards married Miss Pritchard  COVENT GARDEN  Barry deserted to Covent GardenMrs Cibber also after a year's retirement engaged at the same theatreMacklin and wife came from Dub  also Mrs Elmy to that theatreQuin and Woffington remainedConsequently Garrick f  und the coalition so strong that he wished to bri  over Quin to his interest but Quin having had the command at Covent Garden did not  sh to be controuled by Mr Garrick he therefore  stuck to his old master Rich but not without stipulating for one thousand pounds a yearthe greatest salary ever then known to be complied with or I believe since except in the case of Mrs Billington  This collected body of Imperial forces might strike the boldest with dismayThe whole conversation was that Garrick would be ruined by such a powerful opposition but they did not or would not comprehend that Garrick was really as he expressed himself  Arm'd capapee in selfsufficient merit  His Macbeth Lear Hamlet Richard Bayes c stood alone nor as he foretold did his Lear or Hamlet lose their forceBesides he had industry and his troops were under excellent disciplineWoodward assisted him too in a material pointthat of attacking Rich in his deemed invulnerable partthe harlequin departmentfor tho' Rich despised actors he for once in his life in this season relied on them and had nothing to produce as to novelty in the pantomime way of any kind whateverAdded to that the performers at Covent Garden were not under any controul they despised their masterhe despised themand they heartily hated each otherQuin disliked Barry  and Barry Quinand Mrs Cibber and Mrs Woffington held each other in the highest contemptMrs Cibber when called upon by the manager was often feignedly or really ill and though Mrs Woffington was ever ready for any undertaking for the general welfare yet that year her pride was touched and irritated so much that by a refusal one night a great riot ensued as before mentioned in Vol III  Quin and Barry were also averse to assist each otherKing John was called to rehearsal and Barry was not there Quin would not attend the next rehearsal and what Barry settled Quin was sure when he came to contradict  The House opened that season September th with the MISER  Miser  Mr MACKLIN  Lappet  Mrs MACKLIN  Second Play was the BUSY BODY  Marplot  Mr MACKLIN  Patch  Mrs MACKLIN  And on Friday October was the commencement of the scene of battle between the two houses with the run of Romeo and Juliet  Romeo Mr BARRYJuliet Mrs CIBBER  KING JOHN was revived that season thus  King John  Mr QUIN  King of France  Mr RYAN  Hubert  Mr BRIDGEWATER  Pandolph  Mr SPARKS  Dauphin  Mr LACEY  Prince Arthur  Miss MULLART  Bastard  Mr BARRY  Queen Ellinor  Mrs ELMY  Constance  Mrs CIBBER  Lady Blanche  Mrs VINCENT  Lady Falconbridge  Mrs BAMBRIDGE  Two very odd incidents happened during th  run of that play They are in Mr Davies's Miscellanies but as I related them to Mr Davies I claim a right to insert them hereFor he was not in London at the time as he played some seasons at York Edinburgh and Dublin they were as follows  "On Mr Barry's endeavouring to repeat the following words in the first act of the play  "Well now I can make any Joan a lady  "He was so embarrassed in the delivery of this single line that not being able to repeat the words he was obliged to quit the stage amidst the genera  applause of the audience who saw and felt his uneasiness But what is still more surprising after going off and returning three several times with the same kind encouragement of the spectators he was forced to give it up and I believe he did not recover himself till he was relieved by the entrance of Lady Falconbridge  "Mrs Cibber during the representation of  hat Tragedy at Coventgarden theatre the year was suddenly taken illThe play was however announced in the billsMrs Woffington who was ever ready to shew her respect to the public and her willingness to promote the interest of her employer came forward to the front of the pit ready dressed for the character of Constance and offered with permission of the audience to supply Mrs Cibber's place for that night The spectators instead of meeting her address with approbation seemed to be entirely lost in surprise This unexpected reception so embarrassed  er that she was preparing to retire when Ryan who thought they only wanted a hint to rouse them from their insensibility asked them bluntly  f they would give Mrs Woffington leave to act had ConstanceThe audience as if at once awakened from a fit of lethargy by repeated plau  strove to make amends for their inattention to  the most beautiful woman that ever adorned a theatre"  The Refusal was revived by Macklin that winter Mr Lee played Granger but Mr Garrick put the law in force for breach of his article and he was obliged to return to DruryLane where Garrick from that day held a rod of iron over him  She Would if she Could was reviveda vile play indeednot relished  then  by any means  now  to the credit of the audience would not be toleratedThe principal characters were performed by Mr and Mrs Macklin and Mrs Elmy  Mrs Cibber was ill great part of the season It was the last year of Mr Quin's playingHis benefit was about the twelfth of MarchOthello the playThe Moor was ac  ed alternately by him and Barry When Barry acted Othello Macklin played Iago And when Quin acted Othello Ryan was the IagoI wonder Quin's understanding would let him persist in acting Othello where he was so inferior in every respect to Mr Barry Indeed for his last benefit the Prince of Wales commanded OthelloQuin acted Iago to Barry's Othello but strange to relate with the change of characters and the command the house  to that old favorite was very bad There was not any farce that night nor any new play at Coventgarden from the year till  The last character Mr Quin acted as a regular engaged performer was on the conclusive night but two in the season May Horatio in the  air PenitentLothario Barry and Calista Mrs Cibber the best Calista I ever saw and most likely at my time of life that I ever shallBarry not happy in Lothario  In March His Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales died when the theatres wer  shut up for three weeks which proves Miss Bellamy's assertion wrong as to her being at LeicesterHouse and the Princess of Wales patronizing her benefit cthe play to be the Siege of Damascus wishing to see their favourite veteran Quin in his character of Caled which if the reader will observe must be erroneous for that year Miss Bellamy was at Drurylane theatre and Mr Davies must be wrong in his date for this was the year of the run of Romeo and Juliet when Mrs Cibber was at Covent Garden  See Bill of Romeo and Juliet vol page  The day his Royal Highness died the tragedy of Jane Shore was appointed at Coventgarden for the benefit of Mr Ryan  Glo'ster  Mr QUIN  Shore  Mr RYAN  Hastings  Mr BARRY  Alicia  Mrs CIBBER  Jane Shore  Mrs WOFFINGTON  And that might certainly be admitted as tolerable  So different was the practice between then and now relative to the principal performers acting on benefit nights in London that Mr Garrick acted every year from the first to the middling class of performers in general  Mrs Woffi gton the season following quitted Coventgarden for Dublin where she was held in such high estimation as to have her salary of four hundred pounds doubled the second and third winter which the manager from an acknowledged sense of her value judged a debt due to her merit and his own interest She had also two benefits each season in Dublin Mr Victor gives the following description of that lady  "So generous was her conduct though she seldom acted less than four nights a week that she never disappointed one audience in three winters either by real or affected illness and yet I have often seen her on the stage when she ought to have been in her bed"  Mr Hitchcock adds the following  "To her honour be it ever remembered that whilst thus in the zenith of her glory courted and  ressed by all ranks and degrees it made no alt  ation in her behaviour she remained the same g  y affable obliging goodnatured Woffington to every one around her She had none of those occasional illnesses which I have sometimes seen assumed by captial performers to the great vexation and loss of the manager and disappointment of the public She always acted four times each week  "Not the lowest performer in the theatre did she refuse playing for Out of benefits she acted in and one of the other two was for a Mrs Lee who chose to treat the town with an exhibi  i  n of her own JulietSuch traits of character must endear the memory of Mrs Woffington to every lover of the Drama"  Mrs Cibber's benefit early in March was Zara revived  Ozman  Mr BARRY  Zara  Mrs CIBBER  Mr Quin took Othello as beforementioned Mr Barry Romeo and JulietMrs Woffington the Constant CoupleMr Cooke's benefit  was on Friday previous to Prince Frederick's burial when a capital blunder occurredas Mr Quin's name was printed in capitals for the part of Young Bevilbut Mr Barry acted the partIndiana by Mrs Cibber who hitherto has not been and in all probability never will be matched in that character Her manner of saying to Mr Sealand  "Sir if you will pay the money to a servant it will do as well"  and the whole of her last scene in that play was so truly affecting expressive and natural that she really caught the ball which all other Indiana's have been running after in vain  I kn  w it is said that first impressions do a great deal but I can also assert that from Mr Garrick Mr Quin Mrs Bellamy Mrs Crawford and others I could convey to any hearer a strong idea of their manners tones c which would be acknowledged and allowed as real traits by the most rigid observer now existing But Mrs Cibber's excellence was of that superior kind that I can only retain her in my mind's eye Not that all her characters were equally astonishing for Mrs Cibber was but a mere mortal yet her Alicia Constance Ophelia Indiana Juliet c were truly her own Neat simplicity of manners in comedy was equally so But her fine Ladies and  parts of striking humour had better be as they are forgotten This is a great character but a just one  The season concluded the two last nights with Romeo and Juliet without any Farce or Dance c  DRURYLANE  Its worthy observation that what leads historical reg  sters perpetually into error is the confounding the seasons For as the theatres always open in September and do not close till early in the following summer not only the public but the performers themselves are too apt to mistake one year for the other from two dates being unavoida  ly connected with one season Many particulars of these times are related in my first volume  The company remained much as the year before as I do not remember any particular desertions Mr Mossop and Mr Ross were added and of great additional strength for they promised greatly from their first appearancesMr Mossop's  entrée  was in Richard then in Zangaand much applauded Mr Ross in Young BevilMr Dexter also made his appearance that year and astonished every one in the character of  Oroonoko His merit had such an effect at first as to promise wonders and he was prognosticated a powerful adversary to Barry in the Lovers but when he left his honest black his white promised nothing it was a vacuum and he sunk into oblivion He went to Dublin from whence he came He had been educated in the College there was in high esteem as a gentleman and though not an actor of the first class was gentlemanlike in his deportment had a pleasing voice and played second to Mr Sheridan but he did not live many years He was rather dejected at not succeeding on the stage in a more elevated style  Mr Wilder removed this year to DruryLane did very little at either theatre but was much applauded when he sung  "For women love kissing as well as the men"  N B Mr Wilder played Macbeth forty nights in Dublin  The Fair Penitent was often acted this season  Horatio  Mr MOSSOP  Altamont  Mr ROSS  Sciolto  Mr BERRY  Lothario  Mr GARRICK  Calista  Miss BELLAMY  Mr Garrick was the only gentleman I ever saw make the character of Lothario truly conspicuous  Alfred was revived at infinite expence and succeeded Likewise Eastward Hoe for the LordMayor's Day when the practice of acting the London Cuckolds was abolished at that theatre but the play was driven off the stage  Every Man in his Humour was next revived and with great success That comedy increased in public estimation for some seasons Indeed every part in that production of old Den's was so well acted it was hard to point out how any one in that very difficult composition could be amended It was a lucky stroke for Woodward's ad  ancement with the town His performance of Captain Bobadil was wonderful  The Shepherd's Lottery was a very pretty musical pieceMaster Vernon late Mr Vernon made his first appearance in that little Opera The Duet of "By the pale light of the moon" was always encored at that time when sung by Mr Vernon and Miss Norris in that pieceHarlequin Ranger also was much admiredWoodward was an excellent Harlequin In his youth he had been taught that motley character by Mr Rich and had well observed that gentleman's in  ructions  COVENTGARDEN  Mr Quin had retired from the stage May in March and March he came from Bath purposely to play Falstaff in the first part of King Henry IV for his friend Mr Ryan's benefit He after that left him a legacy and made him a present declaring he grew infirm and would not  whistle  Falstaff  Mrs Woffington continued in Ireland so Mr Barry and Mrs Cibber had all their own swayThe Siege of Damascus was revivedBarry Phocyas and Mrs Cibber Eudocia Mrs Cibber also played Lady Townly not much to her credit Venice Preserved was likewise acted when Barry made his appearance as Jaffier He had usually played Pierre and his figure was pleasing and commanding beyond description in that character Mrs Cibber's Belvidera was a nonsuchMr Rich revived that year the Necromancer or Harlequin Doctor Faustus the galleries liked such a dismal sight then but I do not think it would be now tolerated It was not pleasing to me at that time who thought no paradise could exceed a playhouse  Woodward revived Dr Faustus with new scenery and more liveliness several years after at Coventgarden when it answered to the amusement of the public and the coffers of Coventgarden treasuryIn February after several years' promise out came Harlequin Sorcerer which made old Drury tremble for any thing like the rage after that pantomime I never remember  In November when Mr Barry and Mr Sparks were performing Bajazet and I amerlane Arpasia Mrs Cibber one of the gentlemen was so suddenly out in his part that the play could not proceed After a considerable pause Mrs Cibber said  "Gentlemen it is not my turn to speak"  After which the play proceeded without anv other blunder This only is mentioned to prove great actors as well as  small  are liable to  b  n  ers  Mrs Cibber remains unrivalled in Arpasia particularly in the frenzy speech of the last a  t  Miss Macklin that season played Lady Townly for her father's benefit also Jane Shore twice early in the season  Mrs Cibber played Lady Macbeth the first time for her own benefit  The season closed with Romeo and Juliet and the Sorcerer  DRURYLANE  The Company much as before only the los of Mrs Ward who was neither wanted nor regretted as Miss Bellamy's youth fashion dress c aided with Mr Garrick's powerful assistance enabled her to make a tolerable stand in tragedy against Mrs Cibber which Mrs Ward was by no means equal to Eugenia was acted but did not succeed on the English stage notwithstanding its being in great reputation then at Paris and the Rev Mr Frances the author or rather translator was in high rank and esteem in London  Mr Foote's farce of Taste was produced that seasonLady Pentweazle by Mr Worsendale a genius of much wit and humour but it met with a similar fate to Gil BlasMr Garrick's speaking the prologue which he wrote for that farce of Taste was judged a masterpiece and the prologue now speaks for itself though alas Garrick  cannot  The Gamester was actedMr Garrick wonderfulay most wonderful in BeverleyBoadiciarevived by Mr GloverAlso the Genii a pantomime the Silent Woman and the Brothers a tragedy by Dr Young who gave the profits of his three nights as an author to a public  charitybut the amount not answering his wishes and expectations he generously made up the sum to one thousand pounds  COVENTGARDEN  Mr Barry and Mrs Cibber were in high estimation and to particular plays drew good houses But unless to a pantomime or something of particular attraction the boxes were often very thin at the early part of the season whereas DruryLane was constantly attendedThin boxes on any night was seldom seen there as a neatness decorum and regularity pervaded the whole However Mr Rich was very industrious that seasonMrs Bland was engaged from Ireland who had made great progress on the Dublin stage Mr Giffard junior made his appearance in Lear a very improper character the play was wretchedly acted when compared with the performance of the same piece at the rival theatreor indeed without any comparison at allSignor Ma  anesi and Signora Bugiani were that season engaged two inimitable dancers the lady's countenance was the most expressive and strong that can be imagined Their burletta manner gave strong and neat conveyance  to whatever they attempted They drew a great deal of money and indeed that luck was not to be wondered at I have never seen such good  comic  dancers before or sinceMr Cooke and Miss Hilliard who were excellent as dancers in their way were also continued The dances were in such estimation as often to supply the want of a FarceThe Fair was again revived that year to introduce Mr Madox the famous man on the wire who was in the year drowned on his passage to Ireland as was Theophilus Cibber and several performers  Besides the dancers mentioned at CoventGarden that season there were several good ones above mediocrity Monsieur Grandchamps and Madame Ca  argoSaturday January the thirteenth the Sorcerer was again produced and continued with almost equal effect to the finishing of the season It was helped by an additional fountain scene the machi  ry of which I thin  surpas  ed any pantomime quirk I remember and should be now intr  ducedMr Smith's fi  appearance was on Monday Jan i  the character of Theodosius acted four successive n  ghtsThe  arl of Essex a tragedy written by Mr Jones an Irish bricklayer was acted that year and had a considerable  nThose who saw Mr Barry in Essex  eed not be reminded that for attitude and pathe  ic expression of voice and countenance they have not beheld a parallel to that gentleman's pr  nouncing in the last act when the Lieutenant  es the  arl to proceed to immediate execution  ex turns to the Lieutenant pointing to his Countess fainting on the ground and replies  "O lo  k there"  the whole pit of critics actually burst into tears and then shook the theatre with unbounded and repeated applause accompanied wi  h huzzasThe play was well actedMrs  nd was happy in person and manner in Queen  izabeth which luckily placed her in a rank of  nationTo relate that Mrs Cibber as the Countess of Rutland though a short part was ex  llent would be superfluous Her Epilogue w  tten by Mr Garrick to whom she was to re  rn the winter following was a powerful assistant to the playThat was to my supp  sition the  est  eason Mr Rich had ever experienced in my m  mory  Mr Barry was at that time in the prime of life as to health and vigour and Mrs Cibber also at  er best No wonder such a pair of lovers obta  n  d the triumph they were entitled to Indeed  a pity they were ever separated for no two persons were so calculated to assist each other by  voice manner and real feeling as Mr Barry and Mrs Cibber  Mr Smith's second part on the stage was Southampton in the play of EssexMrs Cibber's benefit that year was All for Love with her neat little piece of the Oracle  On Saturday May the season closed with Romeo and Juliet by Mr Barry and Mrs Cibber which proved a separation of two lovers doomed neverno never to meet again  I here publish a bill of that season to shew how difficult it must have been to satisfy eager claimants for being distinguishedIt occasioned much murmuring Sometimes a lady took the lead and her rival was bottomed and the hero placed in the middle but all would not do And in the year the line of  performed  was obliterated and the great letters for the principal were continued which Mr Kemble for his own ease and quiet of the theatre has entirely banished  For the BENEFIT of Signor MARANESI and Miss HILLIARD  THEATREROYAL

Mr Ross and it is certain in love characters Mrs Cibber never  ppeared to such advantage as when with Mr Marry Romeo a  d Juliet was attractive when she and Mr Garrick acted in those parts but still in the love scenes she wanted her former Romeo Mr Garrick indeed in the scenes of fire had the superiority but as the lover Barry was then and is unrivalled and will be till such another starts up but think I may prophecy that will not happen in my time were I to double my years with renovated youthIndeed let a theatrical historian look back and he will not find an actor so excellent as a lover from the days of Betterton as Mr Barry to the present stagestrut hour  Miss Macklin was then engaged and her mother from Covent Garden Miss M at that time was a v  ry fashionable actress accomplished and seemed to promise well but having acquired a sufficiency and grown tired of the profession she retired several years ago from the stage and died in some degree of affluence  That season Virginia was produced in FebruaryMr Garrick did Virginius Mossop Ap  us  Mrs Cibber Virginia and Marcia was the  r  t appearance of Mrs Graham the late Mrs Yates who afterwards stood forth as an honour to the British stageHer beautiful figure and merits are too well remembered to need enco  m or repetition here Mrs Graham was not considered of much promise by Mr Garrick as s  e was not retainedBut Mrs Cibber's illne  s Mr Murphy's incessant pains with Mr Garrick's necessities from Mrs Cibber's indisposition was a lucky circumstance for that lady and the p  blic and produced that charming and beautiful a  tress who otherwise had pined unknown from  e first season and never been more remembered but like a lily drooping pined and died  Mr Garrick wrote the following introductory lines for her in February  If novelties can please to night we've two  Tho'  English  both yet spare 'em as they're new  To one at least your usual favour show  A female asks it can a man say no  Should you indulge our  A new Actress  novice yet unseen  And crown her with your hands a tragic queen  ould you with smiles a confidence impart  To calm those fears which speak a feeling heart  each struggle of ingenuous shame  curbs a genius in its road to fame  With one wish more her whole ambition ends  She hopes some merit to deserve such friends  Creusa was produced that season with a double epiloguethe one by Mrs Pritchard the other by Miss Haughton the Knights by Mr Foote and Fortunatus a very pleasing pantomime by Mr WoodwardMadame Marriot was the Colombine  that  and for several seasonsa beautiful and pleasing figure  COVENT GARDEN  Mr Barry having lost Mrs Cibber as his Juliet lamented thus in his prologue  In such sad plight what could poor Romeo do  Why faith like modern lovers seek a new  And happy shall I think me in my choice  If she's approv'd of by the public voice  Miss Nossiter on Wednesday October made her first appearance she was not much more than the age of Juliet was possessed of a handsome fortune and genteel education strong sensibility and feeling and what added to the performance Romeo and Juliet were really in love and well known to be so She threw strokes in many passages that were not only genuine but forcible and bad fair in time to supply the place of a Cibber  but notwithstanding the advantages of youth and meeting wonderful encouragement Nature had not endowed her with voice and powers sufficient for the arduous task to stand against her rival and they appeared weakened the more she was seen instead of gaining groundIndeed I think I never saw her play so well as the first season neither was her voice musical and her mouth was remarkably wide but she drew to all her characters She acted Juliet a number of nights Her second part was Belvidera and in the mad scene did wonders from tuition attention and strong understanding Rutland the third and Philoclea brought forward and wrote purposely to shew her to advantage by Macnamara MorganMr Barry took infinite pains with Pyrocles Mr Smith did Musidorus but the tragedy was a strange lame sick play and with difficulty languished till the ninth day when poor Philoclea died a natural death and was not basely and cruelly murdered as Mrs Bellamy falsely and invidiously relates as Mr Smith can testify for on the contrary the applause was so violent the first night of representation and the Irish gentlemen's party so strong in its support that Mrs Bland was obliged to repeat a coarse epilogue which was as coarsely spoken  Constantine was also produced at CoventGarden that year and shared an unhappy fate  Miss Bellamy returned here from Drury Lane but the relation in her book relative to that matter being far from authentic for the sake of theatrical truth and history I give the following accounts Thus far indeed she acknowledges viz  "The frequent mistakes which I find I have made in the chronology of my Theatrical Anecdotes will I hope be imputed to my reciting them as I have already observed entirely from memory and the deviation I trust will be excused by my readers as the incidents themselves though perhaps erroneous in point of time are real facts And was I now to set about co  recting the error by an alteration of the d  tes I fear as many of the  happened at so distant a period such a step would only be productive of greater m  stakes  "I have received some corrections on this head from Mr Wilkinson manager of the York company for which I acknowledge myself much obliged to hi  though I cannot for the reason just given avail  yself of them"  As  ate Wilkinson I here note that Constantine was acted that season and shared an unhappy fate Mi  s Bellamy's situation was as she has described in Fluvia TRUTH but the play was acted to a fi  e house on its first night of representation and the third act received loud applauses particularly from Barry's conclusion of it  he also received three plaudits from his manner of pronouncing these two lines in the prologue  Their heroes seem of a superior state  Great in their virtues in  their vices  GREAT  After the third act it grew very languid and the c  rtain dropped with the audience more fatigued than enraged  Miss Bellamy must have been determinably wrong as to her account of Constantine being damned the first night of representation It was first acted on Saturday February also on the Monday and Tuesday following The third  ght as usual for the benefit of the author but the play was unfortunately so ill attended and disapproved that it was again put up on Thursday February the fourth night for the benefit o  the authorThe following insertion was at the bottom of the bill  N B  The receipt of last night not answering Mr Rich has taken it to himself  On Saturday next by his Majesty's command  VENICE PRESERVED  Which significantly insinuated Constantine was in  decline Had the play met a better fate Miss Bellamy's situation was such as must have precluded it  some time as that tragedy was with difficulty hurried thro' the Empress Fulvia being brought to bed that very fourth night and like a woman of spirit she appeared soon after in the penitent Jane Shore for her own benefit Mr Foote acted in the Knights that said evening and gave an imitation of Mr Garrick in the prologue who had wrote and spoke that season the following lines  I read no Greek SirWhen I was at school  Terence wrote prologuesTerence was no fool  Which lines Foote thus ridiculed and in manner very like the Garrick and with effect  I read no Greek SirWhen I was at school  The usher wrote prologuesthe usher was no fool  Miss Bellamy mentions also the great expence Mr Rich was at in reviving Busirus which is a dream of her own invention as Mr Barry revived that play Monday March for his own benefit two years LATER than her account and was acted to a very indifferent house The stage was built but the seats were empty Mr Foote acted Hartop in the Knights that evening to oblige and serve Mr Barry  Mrs Bellamy also relates that on her return to Covent Garden on her appearing in Juliet with Barry that the tragedy had a run exceeding  that of opposition It is so little connected with truth and is so very erroneous that on the contrary when she returned to Covent Garden on the season's opening in the autumn Miss Nossiter was as beforementioned in my Memoirs the Juliet which character Miss Bellamy at that time never had acted with Mr Barry nor ever did till so late as the th of December Her first appearance in on her return was on Tuesday the th of November in a very improper character as was her second on Thursday November her situation considered She was thus announced in the bills  "Athenais by Miss Bellamy her first appearance this stage these three years"  After the chaste Athenais the pure Monimia followed which led to strange ideas that Castalio most certainly had been acquainted with that lady long before the third act After that season and not before it was necessary she wisely changed the appellation of  Miss  to  Mrs  Bellamy  That lady's life being published my own remarks and intimacy with her as an acquaintance friend and actress will not I hope make the following genuine letters unexceptionable as it draws as near to the finish of that once admired  character as the feeling heart or eye would wish to penetrate  DEAR SIR  I HAVE been so out of spirits that I have not been able to do any thing but correct my Apology which I have finished with an address to her Grace of Devonshire who has honoured me with a pension Thalia has not yet visited me therefore I have laid my comedy in lavender for so  e favourite of the laughing muse to fi  ish I am engaged in a polemical controversy which I hope to gain reputation by tho' my language is rather severe My leg is very bad my pocket very low and my spirits quite gone I have had a bill just brought me of sixtyeight pounds for Mr Willet's  amicable suit  as well as some bi  ls I gave which makes me very uneasy one to Usher for twentynine for which he chose to introduce an officer to escort me once more to Parsons and absolutely must get the rules of the King'sBench if I do not pay the money on Saturday I have not heard from Mr I suppose his letter and visit were only a spurt of feeling which soon subsided My son has settled a hundred pounds a year but a guinea more I cannot expect as he is really distressed himself and he was inconvenienced  by advancing ten pounds Could I have got a frank which I will try again for I will send you the lines to her Grace but you must not shew them I fear I shall never be able to walk without assistance and to add to my comforts I have a cough that tears me to pieces I am removed to my Doctor's No

kicked down the pail I find Miss Brunton bids fair to share reputation with Mrs Siddons I had the great honour or being wrote to by Mr Digby to wait upon her Majesty on Thursday but my indisp  sition

alterations as you point out necessary as to facts I must write the whole over again as I wrote merely from memory and as I have acknowledged your wishedfor alterations in print my incorrectness I hope will be excused I hope to see you soon in London and in a happier situation than at present as every being to whom I was the least indebted has called upon m  by arrest and copies of writs which has accumulated my demands to above four times what they were originally As to Bell I have no cause of complaint in money affairs as he stood forth for me in my distress and as the success of the books was precarious I only am concerned he did not according to promise give me the stipulated sets for the subscribers before he disposed of his I desire you will not pay postage  for I shall always

patroness the Duchess of Devonshire up to Michaelmas quarter The impositions are incredible as the people live by the distresses of others I am obliged to give sixteen shillings a week for an apartmenta chandler's shop in front backwards a carpenter's and what with the s  wing of boards the screaming of three illnatured brats the sweet voice of the lady of the mansion who is particularly vociferous with all the gossips who owe her a penny with a coffeemill which is often in use and is as noisy as Londonbridge when the tide is coming in makes such unpleasing sounds it is impossible to think of any thing added to this I have not a place for a servant Could I raise sufficient  to furnish me an apartment I should be tolerably easy as I have begun a work which seems to flatter success though a great undertaking  The Characters of my own Times  Could I raise by subscription to enable me to obtain  quiet  I could live at half the expence and be as easy as my situation would admit  They tell me it is my birth day  that is  the day of the month  for I see nobody not even the person I most esteem upon earth and who flatters me he is my friend Mr A If you should happen to see Mr

to be involved I told you before I paid part of my old debts and renewed securities for the remainder which indiscretion has been productive of every distress as well as reproach in lieu of their being sensible that I paid all I received and was most cruelly deceived in the expectation of paying every body I am as lame as ever and as the bone can never be set shall never be able to w  lk without assistance I suppose Mrs Crawford will bring you moneysuch unprincipled people are generally lucky  A strange remark from my friend Bellamy  I fear it would be only losing time to apply to Mr

here could say something droll about a good stomach but it is ill jesting with edge tools and I am sure that's the sharpest thing about meYou may think I can have no sense of my condition that while I am thus wretched I should offer at ridicule But Sir people constitutioned like me with a disproportionate levity of spirits are always most merry  when they are most miserable and quicken like the eyes of the consumptive which are always brightest the nearer a patient approaches to dissolutionHowever Sir to shew you I am not entirely lost to all reflection I think myself poor enough to want a favour and humble enough to ask it hereSir I might make an encomium on your goodnature and humanity cbut I shall not pay so bad a compliment to your understanding as to endeavour by a parade of phrases to win it over to my interest If you could any night at a concert make a small collection for me it might be a means of obtaining my liberty and you well know Sir the first people of rank abroad will perform the most friendly offices for the sick Be not therefore offended at the request of a poor though a deservedly punished debtor  G A STEVENS  From this facetious letter of George Stevens's and Mrs Bellamy's latter account we must remember in this stagejournal I was busily employed a few pages back with an account of th  season where I still am supposing mysel  giving an account though I have been wandering on matters not relative thereto But from Mrs  Bellamy and the other personages mentioned of at that time I must add that Mrs Gregory also made her first appearance on any stage in the character of Hermione Thursday January It was falsely reported that Mr Barry refused playing Orestes fearing her success should interfere with Miss Nossiter'sThe story gained such credit that he judged it necessary to publish an advertisement in all the papers contradicting the malicious propagation That lady grew into the highest fashion afterwards at the Dublin theatre She married a gentleman bred to the bar in Ireland a Mr Fitzhenry a gentleman of family and abilities and took leave of the public at Dublin within these four or five seasons having wisely provided from her gains on the stage to live decently and comfortably offAfter all  he storms of a theatrical life I ever cast a wi  hful eye whenever I read success accompanied with such comfortable finishings  This was the first winter also for Italian  at CoventGarden theatreSignora Nicolina better known and remembered from the character of Spilletta which she inimitably performed in the opera of Gli Amanti Gelosi wa  particularly admired in the Italian song  the hat which some years since has been translated introduced and sung by Diana in the pleasing  opera of Lionel and Clarissa The burlettas that year brought Mr Rich a great deal of money  Mr Garrick thus alludes to their success  I as your cat'rer would provide you dishes  Dress'd to your palates season'd to your wishes  Say but you're tir'd with boil'd and roast at home  We too can send for  niceties  from Rome  To please your taste will spare not pains nor money  Discard  Sirloins  and get you  Maccaroni  Whate'er new  Gusto  for a time may reign  Shakspeare and beef will have their turn again  The season again closed at CoventGarden Wednesday the twentysecond of May with Romeo and Juliet and Harlequin Sorcerer  Mr Shuter had quitted DruryLane for CoventGarden where he grew weekly ay nightly  nt  favour with the public Mrs Bland was become Mrs HamiltonIt is very strange but true that Shuter was only looked upon as a young man of tolerable merit at DruryLane the Old Man in Lethe his principal partbut at CoventGarden he seemed a sudden blaze of lightThis certainly must be allowed an instance that with genius opportunity is every thing but the misfortune is without talents and genius actor  will be cla  ming the same right of ascending th  throne of merit but the ladder suddenly breaks and down drops Dido  DRURYLANE  The company remained much as the year before Mr Garrick was truly inimitable in Don JohnMrs Clive was equal in the Mother Mr Yates in the old whimsical character of Don Antonioand the whole comedy was supported as it might be wished every play should be  Barbarossa was produced that year and was much followedThe Chances revived and altered by Mr Garrick at the command of his late Majesty had a great runand Coriolanus was g  t up in which character Mr Mossop raised his reputation Mr Garrick was a quick general and it is most probable Mr Mossop would not have had the luck of that play being produced at such expence but that Mr Garrick was eager to get the start of the rival theatre where it was preparing with infinite pomp and splendour The very idea of a triumphal procession at CoventGarden struck terror to the whole host of Drury however big they looked and strutted on common occasions  The Sabatinis were engaged this year at a great expence as dancers They appeared in two new Ballads the one called the Pandours the other the Italian Fishermen but they were both utterly disapproved and did not appear six nights during the whole winterThe Drummer also was revived and tolerably well received and followed  The Fa  ries an opera from Shakspeare's Midsummer Night's Dream was that year introduced It was well performed and with good success aided not a little by an excellent prologue and as excellently spoken by Mr GarrickGiordani and Passerini were of great additional service a  Lysander and Hermia  The Mistake was revived for Woodward's benefit  Don Carlos  Mr GARRICK  Sancho  Mr WOODWARD  Lopez  Mr YATES  Jacin  ha  Mrs CLIVE  Leonora  Mrs PRITCHARD  Mercury Harlequin was the new pantomim  that season  COVENTGARDEN  Barry was invited to Dublin on a salary of l and two benefits Mr Victor and Mr Sowden  were the desperate undertakers after Sheridan's abdicationMiss Nossiter Mr Barry's favourite Juliet made a point of having five hundred pounds and Mrs Gregory who had only appeared in two characters the winter before at CoventGarden once in Hermione and in Alicia twice once for Mr Sparks and another night for Mrs Bellamy at three hundred poundsBarry on his departure from England denounced ruin on Mr Rich by his desertion but such threats were weak in the extreme It is true Mr Sheridan's Romeo was vain and ridiculous immediately after Barry's but Barry forgot that with the aid and n  velty of new performers and Mr Rich's neverfailing support pantomime and with a theatre in London where the metropolis can pour in such incredible numbers it must be the manager's own fault indeed if he be ruined by the loss of any performer whatever  Mr Sheridan by the great riot in Dublin being obliged to leave that city occasioned by the representation of Mahomet in February in which perturbation Mrs Woffington was supposed to have aided as a party concerned in  real  state politics which certainly has not any connection or business within the walls of a theatre that lady was also obliged to retire from Ireland at the same time with Mr Sheridan  It is one of the most remarkable riots that ever occurred in any theatre and well worthy of being read by every admirer of theatrical history It would be impertinent to introduce it here as it must be well known or should be to all theatrical persons Those who have not been made acquainted with that period of the early part of the established Irish stage will find it all fully explained in a modern volume lately printed by Mr Hitchcock a gentleman of great ability and integrity of the Dublin theatreIt gives a general view of the Irish theatre from its commencement down to the year and will well repay the trouble of a little attention I can answer as for myself that I often take Mr Hitchcock's book up for information  Mr Sheridan this year came over and was engaged by Mr Rich in the autumn The season opened with some of Mr Rich's stock comedies very ill acted indeed and as dingily dressed  October Mrs Green made her appearance from Dublin in the character of Lappet a good comic actressmuch the best in chambermaids Mrs Heidelbergs c since the time of Mrs Clive  On Friday October Othello was announced with an occasional prologue spoke by Mrs Hamilton for the introducing Mr Murphy  A gentleman well known and admired for his talents as an author and many very respectable qualities and often mentioned in the course of my Memoirs He was to appear in the difficult and dangerous part of Othello rendered at that time more hazardous than the present by the well known excellence of Mr Barry in that character Mr Murphy had many other reasons to be alarmed as he had long waged his pen of war as author of the Gray'sInn Journal and had been the terror of poets and the scourge of players  The novelty held out was a charm irresistible to attend CoventGarden theatreMr Murphy's judgment then or now would be absurd to call in question and I hold that gentleman in true regard but on the stage he certainly wanted what we behind the scenes call powers c  for great effect  After that gentleman's novelty of three nights on Tuesday October the twentyfirst the Nonjuror was advertisedDoctor Wolf Mr Cibber his first appearance for four years and Maria Mrs Woffington her first appearance for three years which drew a great houseSo favourite an actress and so well acquainted with persons in higher life will easily gain credit to my account She was of course greatly received and played that character as well as i  could be played  On Wednesday the d of October Mr Sheridan made his first appearance in his esteemed character of Hamlet Judicious without doubt but when compared to the combined excellencies of a Garrick and the pleasing powers of the winning Barry he was not by any means established from that night's performance as a darling of the London audienceTho' in Dublin not any one performer whatever even the Garrick at that time would not have been universally crowned with laurel as to preference or perhaps equality but as Mr Macklin has  a  d that opinion had been jerked into the Irish audience from his father Dr Sheridan the schoolmaster He next appeared in Richard without any remarkable applause till the dying scene where he was equal to any actor if not superior to any I had then or have since seen without the aid of a flounderlike flouncing as the modern Richard's practice to the great pleasure approbation and universal plaudits from the  galleries  Till I broke my leg I was much attached to that tumb  ing exhibition and surprising featlike agility  In November Phaedra and Hippolitus was revivedTheseus Sheridan Hippolitus Smith Phaedra Mrs Woffington and had not any farce ta  ked to i  though a play consisting of five characters only It was the custom on revived  plays and invariable with new ones not to have any entertainment for the first nine or twelve nightsit would have been judged disgraceful nor did any play whatever intervene unless from illness or an unforeseen cause Phaedra had not any success that year Indeed though the poetry is elegant it is too learned and too languid The performers and audience seemed half asleep and the candles burned dim unless at the following passage which with the advantage of Mrs Woffington's figure and new dress prepared them for the chace  Come let us hunt the stag and chace the foaming boar▪  Come rouse up all the horrid monsters of the wood  For there even there Hippolitus will guard me  After which rouse all parties on and off the stage as by mutual consent unanimously returned to their evening's nap  Mr Moncrife's Appius was acted that season on the same story of Virginia produced the year before by the Rev Mr Crofts at DruryLane but destitute of every comparative merit either as to plot incident writing or any other claim to preference and as to acting lamentably deficient One speech of Mr Sheridan's though I never saw the play but the first night out of the six i  was acted I never can forget he delivered the following lines so energetic  O by the gods I hunger for revenge  I thirst I thirst for bloodfor blood of Appius  Coriolanus was revived with great pompMr Sheridan conveyed a masterly knowledge of the character and his immortal author old Shakspeare That play drew several houses but his OEdipus Romeo Zanga Lord Townly Sir Charles Easy Osmyn c did not bear equal credit Italian burlettas were attempted by a new set of Italians but met with very little attraction or applauseThe first was L'Arcadia in Brenta on Monday the th of November the second entitled La Famiglia de Bertoldi Mr Murphy performed Jaffier only between his first appearance and the benefits in March when he acted Archer Young Bevil Hamlet Macbeth c  Mr Clarke made his first appearance that season in Osman in Zara on Thursday the th of October an actor that must be at this time well remembered by his brethren and the public tho' his talents were not strong enough to let him live long after death  A Mrs Glen also made her appearance that year in Rutland Monday February  I am right as to the dates of the month c but Mr Clarke and Mrs Glen's appearances were in October Mrs Glen's in February    That lady I can only remember being apt to have  its on the stageIndeed strange fits off the stage ladies and gentlemen are often subject toI have sometimes been so affected myself  Mr Rich revived Orpheus and Eurydice that season Wednesday January which drew crowds but not equal to the Sorcerer nor held in great estimation That pantomime has been tried twice or thrice since then but without success  Mr Poitier an excellent dancer indeed wa  introduced that year and greatly admired He came from the Opera House at Paris his first appearance was on Tuesday Dec I do not recollect any very particular incidents that seasonMrs Bellamy revived Alzira for her benefitZamor Mr Murphy and the season concluded on Thursday May with the Constant Couple Sir Harry of course by Mrs Woffington the entertainment was Orpheus and Eurydice  DRURYLANE  Mr Mossop was this year enticed partly owing to an affront mentioned in my Memoirs over to Dublin by Mr Victor and Mr Sowden to play on shares and two benefits where he only  acted twentyfour nights finding he could obtain more profit for himself by acting twenty than forty nights for his employersSo in fact Mr Mossop's great drawings  in  was on the other nights the inevitable occasion of great drawings  out  from the treasury of that theatre Mr Garrick from the unexpected loss of Mossop engaged Mr Murphy to supply that bulwark the other's absence had occasioned to give way Mr Murphy's first appearance was on Tuesday the th of September in Osmyn in the Mourning Bride Mr Holland started forth in the month of October Monday the th in the character of Oroonoko supported by Mrs Cibber in Imoinda He was a shining ornament and an honest truly agreeable man was universally beloved but death snatched him in the bloom of life and improvement and deprived the stage of an actor of merit and a worthy characterHe was too apt to  outherod  Herodby which false judgment mistaking it for genuine fire the big manly voice became too often harsh and unpleasing In consequence when Powell came in view tho' a suckling he soon threw Holland at a distance by keeping within the bounds of Nature and  true spirit  This sacrifice of sense and sound which I glaringly gave way to for the sake of catching momentary applause would be less practised than  it is would we once consider that the opinions of the principal leaders of fashion in every place will influence the million in a great measure and by them will be allowed followed and adopted The following lines on this subject were wrote on Holland  When GARRICK by whatever motive led  Fatal to taste took travel in his head  Griev'd for I knew the players of the age  Griev'd I foresaw the ruin of the stage  No more said I o'erleaping vulgar awe  Shall Shakspeare terror raise or pity draw  Catching the spirit with the poet caught  The very pith and marrow of his thought  Our GARRICK acted as our Shakspeare wrote  But now scarce understood without a note  Of all his more than manly vigour gelt  Holland  must rant and whine where GARRICK felt  Thus anxious for the widow'd stage my mind  With much too perfect augury divin'd  Holland  poor man in Hamlet makes appear  What cause what mighty cause we had to fear  But though no actingmerit he displays  His modesty must sure deserve our praise  Which that the piece in all points should agree  Desir'd that  Hopkins  might Ophelia be  Athelstan was produced that year written by Doctor Brown Mr Garrick did his very best to support it and the play certainly had merit  and was well acted but it never recovered the chilness of the spring nor has ever taken root budded or flowered from that time to this  The Winter's Tale introduced with an excellent prologue by Mr Garrick had a very considerable run Mrs Cibber's neat simplicity in singing the song wrote by Mr Garrick  Come come my good shepherds our flocks we must shear c  made little Perditta appear of the greatest consequenceIt was well cast and the performance justified Mr Garrick's judgment in so ordering the characters Catherine and Petrucio was altered into three acts on the same occasion Petrucio Mr Woodward Catherine Mrs CliveHe threw her down on the exit of the second act which had very near convinced the audience that Petrucio was not so lordly  s he assumed for Mrs Clive was s  enraged at her fall that her talons tongue and passion wer every expressive to the eyes of all beholders and it was with the utmost difficulty Kate suppressed her indignationThe first representation of these pieces was on the st of January  The Apprentice was introduced that year January d by Mr Murphy who spoke a prologue to that farce which was afterwards inimitably  and constantly repeated by Mr Woodward in the character of Dick in which part he was excellent The farce had a great run and still continues in full effect and ever  ill while a clever spirited comedian like Mr Lewis or Mr Banister jun has the Apprentice intrusted to his care and guardianship  The Tempest as an opera in three acts with recitative c was introduced that season with a paltry dialogue as may be seen in the magazine of Feb Signora Curioni an Italian singer performed in it but it was dreadfully heavyIt went through with great labour eight nights but not without the aid of the garland dance well performed by sixty children at the end of the second act and the pantomine of Fortunatus or the Genii after that  All's Well that Ends Well was revivedI imagine to please Woodward who was  ond of acting ParoliesHe revived that play at Dublin and also when last at Covent Garden but I never remember any remarkable success or pleasure received from the representation of that play though here and there it must be confessed there are scenes of merit whimsicality and genius but it never will be like the master productions of Shakspeare a standing dish or an alluring spectacle to the public eye  The Fair Quaker was also revived that winter and was well acted but the comedy of itself has not much sterling merit and its humour and the characters are too coarse for the nice discrimination of the present age However Mr Garrick made the play stand its ground from the good acting of Woodward and Mr Yates in Beau Mizen and Flip and the parts in general not a little reinforced by the good and popular pieces the manager added as a support and the new song of  "Hearts of oak are our ships"  by Mr Beard  The CHINESE FESTIVAL at an immense expence was produced on Saturday November  by command of his Majesty King George the Second  See vol I page for bill of the  first  night  It was in the time of the war with FranceThe multitude conceived it was purposely got up by Mr Garrick to introduce Frenchmen to eat up all the bread the beef and the pudding from the Englishmen and they were by artful incendiaries which are never wanting to do evil so inflamed and the hydraheaded monster was so powerful as not to let the presence even of majesty secure a decent representation It was again attempted and strongly supported on Wednesday Nov after the comedy of the Inconstant but the fatal night of the Great Riot and entire overthrow of the FESTIVAL was on the  Tuesday  following  Nov Essex was the play that night the Earl by Mr MurphyThe nobility mustered all their forces drawn swords c but the  mobility  against reason and their own rational entertainment like a torrent bore down all before them Mr Garrick's house had nearly been torn to pieces infinite mischief was done the theatre and John Bull was exulting with triumph Some nights after Mr Garrick advertised his performance in Archer when on his entrance something murmured likePardon pardon on which he advanced with great respect and as great firmness explained how ill he had been treated by the wanton and malignant conduct of wicked individuals both in his property fame and characterHe acknowledged all favours received but unless he was that night permitted to perform his duty to the best of his abilities he was above want superior to insult and would never  never  appear on the stage againWhile he was speaking all tumult ceasedIt was indeed a calm after a stormThey seemed so struck with the truth which he asserted and addressed to them the propriety of his conduct and the injury from illiberality and wicked wantonness he had actually sustained that from the idea of censuring Mr Garrick unmeritedly they felt the reproach deservedly on themselves and like truehearted Britons burst into such an universal according  applause as for several minutes shook the fabric of Old DruryHarmony was settled before and behind the curtain to the mutual gain and credit of all parties as Mr Garrick after that for years enjoyed deservedly the wellearned smiles and unbounded favours of the public and that public in return had the happiness of seeing him in a  onstant round of characters three times in the week on an averagethe first actor that ever did so variously and excellently perform such a contrast of capital chara ters who but for this  ucky accident perhaps might have been lost to the great regret of his admirers who never did or will take him for all in all lock upon his like againWherever there are many enemies there will always be merit to create such envy  The particulars of the riot relative to the Chinese Festival may be seen in Mr Victor's second volume page to  I do not remember any other remarkable occurrence that year at Drury Lane theatre except that on Saturday March Mr Garrick gave his first performance of Lord Chalkstone for Mrs Clive's benefit which had a great run and kept the house open later than usual The season concluded with Mr Garrick's Benedick and Lethe  Not acted these TEN YEARS  For the Benefit of Mrs CLIVE  At the Theatre Royal in DruryLane  On Saturday next being the th of March  Will be revived a Comedy called  The LADY's LAST STAKE  Or The WIFE's RESENTMENT  Written by COLLEY CIBBER  Esq    Lord GEORGE BRILLIANT Mr WOODWARD  Lord Wronglove by Mr PALMER  Sir Friendly Moral by Mr BERRY  Lady Gentle by Mrs PRITCHARD  Mrs Conquest by Mrs DAVIES  Miss Notable by Miss MACKLIN  Hartshorn by Miss MINORS  Lady Wronglove by Mrs CLIVE  Being the First Time of their Appearance in those Characters  To which will be added a DRAMATIC SATIRE called  LETHE  In which will be introduced  A NEW MODERN CHARACTER to be performed  By Mr GARRICK  The Fine Lady Mrs CLIVE  In which will be introduced a New Mimic Italian Song  Part of the Pit will be laid into the Boxes  COVENTGARDEN  Mr Sheridan's success at CoventGarden the preceding winter where he had not taken any benefitnight did not occasion inducement from Mr Rich to propose or Mr Sheridan to offer his servicesMr Barry returned from Ireland after the harvest of a wellfought fieldand in his hand Miss Nossiter Mrs Bellamy then in reputation as an actress continued still with Mr Richalso Mrs WoffingtonShe and Bellamy were imp  acable enemiesNegotiations were off and on between Barry and Rich till November before any thing definitive occurred and Mr Rich as usual went dreaming on with Volpone Way of the World Country Lasses c while DruryLane seemed as secure as if only one theatre was permitted in the capital of LondonHowever on Wednesday November the twelfth Mr Barry acted Hamlet to a numerous audience and was deservedly received with raptureBut the loss sustained by Mrs Vincent being the Ophelia a useful but an affected actress in lieu of Mrs Cibber made a woeful comparative play to that of Mr Garrick's at DruryLane with Ostrick Mr Woodward and Ophelia and the Queen by Mrs Cibber and Mrs Pritchard Indeed  the only person of sterling abilities I can remember in that highly finished character of Opheha since Mrs Cibber is Mrs S Kemble That lady has infinite merit in a variety of playing but where the artless the feeling and the impressive to reach the soul is requisite she need not in such departments fear the most Critical Review for her natural representations must live on stage record and may fearless bid defiance to satire or  If Sterne's Maria was properly introduced as an opera character I think it would prove lucky for the author to have Mrs S Kemble for her representative  Mr Barry on the Friday following his Hamlet acted Jaffier and strange to relate with so wonderful and so deserved a favourite and in a character where he was so truly excellent there actually were only twenty persons in the upper gallery a bad pit and I may suppose many orders and only two ladies in the sideboxes on one hand and  ot three gentlemen on the other side However  he season on the whole was great as was Mr Barry's success though I now recollect his acting Henry the Fifth Wednesday December the third where his performance was enchanting to much the same kind of house as I have mentioned to his Jaffier  Miss Nossiter did not make her appearance till  late in the season on Friday December the twelfth in the character of Monimia which she performed to a crowded audience Barry acted Castalio so excellently that he was the only one I wish to rememberSome aspiring youth will smilingly observe that when folks grow ancient they pronounce excellencies and paint beauties of their  old  favorites which never existed because those of the present day cannot contradict them but I have proved myself far from being insensible of the high merits of the present race of performers in many instances and wish not because I praise  Barry's Castalio  to see him were he now living in the  Count of Narbonne  as Mr Kemble there is himself  alone  and shews  "like a great seamark standing every flaw and pleasing those that eye him"  Alexander was revived with very great pomp of which Mrs Bellamy's books give a very full account and also of her quarrel with WoffingtonIt drew crowded audien  es for many nights was first acted on Thursday January the fifteenth where Barry really appeared himself the leading God  King Lear was revived also that year in which he was highly received and a critic pronounced  "To Barry they gave loud huzzas""To Garrick only tears"  Barry in the pathetic scenes had infinite me  t and acted all wellBut the character taken in general was never seen in my opinion truly depicted with that fire neatness energy quickness and every various requisite as by the inimi  able Garrick In tragedy King Lear was his masterpiece his Macbeth excepted  Italian Burlettas were tried a third season but did not meet with success after the first yearThey had then the same set of comic s  ers viz Signora Nicolina  alias  Spiletta her  c as the two years preceding Spiletta drew money it must be granted but her first year  e ha  been universally allowed the inimitable the  rming the expressive SHE Be it observed that  rlettas had not been introduced at the King's Theatre in the HayMarket the entertainments co  sisted only of the serious opera and the grand da  ng not any comic performers whatever ei  her as singers or dancersThe first comic opera was on Monday the th of January La Comediante Fatta Cantatrice the second and the b  was Gli Amanti Gelosi  Mr Foote on Tuesday February the second  ter the play of Lady Jane GrayLady Jane Mrs Woffington produced his new farce of the Englishman returned from ParisIt was well  ed was much followed and filed the pockets  of manager and performerMr Rich did so well with Barry Foote and the revived plays that he had less dependence on pantomime that season than usual Mr Foote shared the nights of his farce as Author and Actor He performed Sir Charles Buck and acted Sir Paul Pliant in the Double Dealer and other characters to help his farceHis benefit as the author of the Englishman Returned was on the th of March Hamlet was the playHamlet Mr BarryQueen Mrs WoffingtonPolonius Mr Footeand was by every one thought a man of talents but a very bad statesman He was so convinced of his error that the day before his benefit he resigned his place at court and Mr Arthur was his substitute for Lord Chamberlain  Mr Barry's benefit that year was on Monday March the Busiris with the KnightsHartop Mr FooteMrs Woffington's was Ulysses and the Frenchified Lady Mr Smith on Saturday April again chose the Siege of Damascus and acted AbudahThat performer was known then and now by the appellation of  Gentleman  Smith from that upright conduct with which he set forward and has stedfastly walked in the same path to this day by which perseverance he has reached the snug retreat of content He was at that time rising rapidly into fame as an actor  therefore possessed a double claim to applause and encouragement He had supported most of Mr Barry's characters the winter preceding and his long continued good reception and deservings are so well known that my panegyric would be futile and impertinent  Wednesday May the season concluded with the usual old bill of fareWoffington's Sir Harry and Orpheus  DRURYLANE  Mr Mossop returned to his allegiance and Mr Sheridan was reinstated in his Irish government not without numerous spies and lurking enemies  s Barry and Mossop on their trips during his absence had infused different seeds of discord which rankled and kept up the smothered flames of party and ended in mutual ruin For as mentioned in my Memoirs Sheridan was defeated and obliged for a time to seek refuge in England  Barry at CoventGarden was sinking for want of variety of characters he playing only in tragedy Young Bevil and Lord Townly excepted And though he may be equalled in judgment or inferior to some performers in yet his voice and countenance can neither be purchased surpassed nor acquired  for the lovers  Garrick being reinforced with Mossop gave his  company the undoubted superiority and the little tyrant  "Look'd spoke fought and was himself a war"  Barry's novelty was worn out in some degree and though a darling of the public's and next to impossible he should be otherwise yet Garrick carried all before him  Harlequin Proteus or Harlequin in China was the pantomime of that year  Miss Pritchard's promised appearance caused much conversation and expectation this season her features fixed the eye of every beholder off the stage the face was so exquisitely handsome She was not much older than a young lady  now  a candidate for stage favour I mean Miss Wa  s Her public merits cannot with any pr priety be here introduced as it would be out o  all ti e and place and subversive to the plan I have adopted and observed relative to others  or the present publication Yet I cannot refrain for the credit of the stag to be her herald and with th trumpet of  ruth  ound forth that her purity and good conduct may challenge the breath of Slander  nvy or Detraction and her undeniably good character is such that the more it is investigate  Like  in open air  'Twill blea  the more and whiten to the view  Mr Garrick's Lear seemed to have gained additional strength lustre and fashionMr Shuter had the year preceding revived the Wonder  at CoventGarden theatre for his benefit which became in consequence a stock comedy Gibby by Mr Shuter who was there the leading char  erDon Felix the hero was execrably per  ated by a Mr Gibson Mr Garrick revived r eal  y in the season Saturday Nov  the play was so well conducted Gibby excepted by Johnson who could speak the dialect but not act that the play was perpetually called f  and relished as a perfect performance partic  ly Mr Garrick's Don Felix and it was equ  ly attractive every year when he performed that  aracte  which had never before been noticed in the list of  capital  parts He valued him  el  on his reputation in performing Don Felix to much that he fixed on it as the last mark of genius he ever gave which was on Monday  ne for the benefit of the theatrical  On which night after the comedy he took his farewell of the stage when more tears were fi  ed from box pit and gallery for the loss of that truly inimitable actor than at the representa  on of any tragedy seen in ancient or modern  Don Felix died that night and I fear without issue to claim  true  right and do his name  honour and justice  The Male Coquette written by Garrick was also well received The Reprisal and Proteus or Harlequin in China by Woodward were both well approved but not very attractive  Miss Pritchard's was a most remarkable first appearance Saturday Oct The partiality for her mother from the most respectable and indulgent audience in the world Mr Garrick's patronage and tuition and her own beautiful face which was fascinating to a degree occasioned curiosity in shoalsThe mother Mrs Pritchard leading her daughter on in Juliet as  Lady Capulet  the tears of the young ladythe good wishes and tenderness of the town all combined made an affecting and pleasing sceneBut that partiality dwindled away in the early part of the season  Her second appearance was on the th of October in the character of Lady Betty Modish where Mrs Pritchard had been often seen and was incomparable in spite of personbut the daughter wanted the mother's soul her feeling her fire her whim her imagination which here plainly shews that teaching and teaching will never do unless Providence has given genius and nature to be mouldedIn that case the master may justly claim credit and perhaps more than is his due but without that precious gift  talents  which must come from the universal Ma+ker  alone no master can bring a pupil however learned beyond a dull languid mediocrity to public view with eclat  I do not recollect more particulars that year except Mr Foote's producing the Author which had a great run indeed not only from the good acting of Mr Foote in Cadwallader the out  es of which character he had taken from a private family in which he gave great proof of humour satire c but from Mrs Clive being not  ver in Mrs Cadwallader The piece had great  ss And wherever it is perfectly acted and t  e parts of Mr and Mrs Cadwallader are done  to in the performance that farce will ever be a  and of entertainment to all who are susceptible  true comic  force  It is not so local and  as many of Mr Foote's pieces but is so near Nature though extravagantly drawn that the piece whenever done justice to and a favourite actor and actress in the two parts it will live on the stage for an age to come  Near this period or indeed two years later the stage was favoured with a new candidate for fame the eldest son of the late Mr Fleetwood formerly proprietor of DruryLane theatreHis person was elegant and handsome To his under  tanding and education he also possessed intrepidity with coolness and never on any occasion was  thrown off his guard so as for any opponent whatever to look or speak to him but as a gentlemanThis was of infinite service to Mr Fleetwood as a billiard player at which amusement he was by all allowed so excellent that few would venture to hazard with himHis wellknown abilities were so highly rated by all who knew him that great expectations were formed of his stage success He performed Romeo at DruryLane as I recollect on his first appearance and had a grace and  ase that seemed not only to obtain but command applause Yet with all these advantage his voice seemed consumptive and his powers deficient and the more he played the less he pleased either the audience or himself except in Young Bevil however tho' little accustomed to the stage there was an  ase accompanied with elegance and native dignity in his deportment that take it from the first rising of the curtain to its f  ll he displayed more merit and gentlemanlike judgment than any first rate performer I either had at that time seen or since in that difficult first rate and accomplished characterBeing ambitious and of strong discernment he soon found the  drama  would not answer in that style of lucrative superiority at which he only aimed he therefore in less than two years' experiment of stage enterprise retired  rom the theatre and engaged I have been informed in an undertaking  in the WestIndies where he has rapidly made a considerable fortune and is I believe at this time living in that climate enjoying the fruits of ingenuity and industry points which conjoined seldom fail eing the reward of talents and strong geniusThe Ambitious Step Mother was revived for him at DruryLane in to perform Artaxerxes but without approbation  Not having collected this work from notes but merely from memory Mr Fleetwood had not occurred to my remembrance but from having lately seen a ridiculous situation on the stage at the York  heatre from beholding Romeo's having a real sword instead of a foil to grace his  gh A circumstance very wrong to trust to even  er the guide of the most cautious as hurry  attention the stage  uror and a thousand accidents may for want o  instant reflection occasion m  t alarming accidentswe often receive  ts  rom our  tage battles I myself can bear  mony to an honourable  car obtained in  e  d  a  fencers one cause and blades  well tem  ere  too often another which oc  on  hiet but to incur the hazard o  certain dangerous weapons is surely neither par  ab  nor  ufferable  lately  aw Romeo with a real sword which the fiery I  balt no sooner viewed than he kept  not only a preposterous  prudent  distance but  e  down dead without an attempt at battle Another instance was when Mr Fleetwood just mentioned was acting Romeo at DruryLane He had forgot his foil Mr Austin was the Paris and not knowing his danger was determined to be courageous and fought like a lion till Mr Romeo who fenced well and elegantly being determined to conquer in reality whipped Mr Austin through the guts  sans ceremonie  Swords were  then  prohibited in consequence and a severe penalty inflicted for wearing one on any account Accidents of that sort were more likely then to happen than at present as not any gentleman of the  London  theatres when dressed was ever seen without a sword by his side  A misfortune of a similar kind to that lately mentioned is that of the late celebrated Mr Farquhar who after being on the stage as an actor ob  ained a commission in the army in which situation he wrote several well known and entertaining comedies the Beaux Stratagem Constant Couple the Recruiting Officer and several others which at that time and the present are in deserved high estimation but an unlucky accident in the year  put a period to his performingBeing to play Guyamor in the Indian Emperor who kills Vasquez and having  forgot to change his sword for a foil he wounded a Mr Price who acted Vasquez dangerously though not fatally The impression which this accident made on a mind so sensible and the reflecting on what might have been the consequences determined him to relinquish a profession which might perhaps expose him to like mistakes in futureI have merely introduced this matter here for every performer seriously to consider that it is no reason but that what has not yet befallen him may unhappily at some future period ensue and not trusting to the hazard is a certain preventive to the danger  From the peril of swords  permit  me to return to my stage calendar and relate that Miss Bar  n now Mrs Abington's first appearance at DruryLane was on Friday the twentyninth of October in Lady PliantSir Paul Pliant Mr FooteHer second appearance was on the third night of the Wonder in the Virg  n UnmaskedLilliput a Satire written by Mr Garrick was excellently acted by children And the season concluded with Mr Garrick's performance of Lord ChalkstoneAfter the play of Essex Mrs Pritchard's Queen Elizabeth from indisposition was read by Mrs  net now living That night was appropriated for  the benefit of a Mrs Horton a celebrated actress for some seasons after the decease of Mrs Oldfield but I am sorry to relate though it was on a charitable occasion and Mr Garrick aided the performance with his powerful assistance that neither first nor half price gave any appearance of help or spirit to support the once admired Mrs HortonIt was no more than  sans boxsans pitsans gallerysans every thing    COVENT GARDEN  This season opened rather languidMr Barry's Lear was not attractiveAlexander did something Nossiter was the Statira as Bellamy was ill and had broke her arm Woffington was on the decline but she never neglected her business tho' her health spirits and beauty were visibly de  aying  wo plays of Beaumont and Fletcher's W  t without Money and the Humorous Lieutenant were revived at a great expence they were well conducted and met with some success  he Humourous Lieutenant was performed at the command of his present Majesty then Prince of Wales on Friday the th of DecemberAlso Mrs Centlivre's comedy of the Rover was produced and commanded by his MajestyA  tered this year by Mr Kemble which alterations  were requisite as in Ned Blunt actually undressed to his drawersThe London Cuckolds was acted for the last time I believe on the lord mayor's dayThe Englishman returned from Paris being published as was ever the custom in those daysnot locked up as at present as if afraid to see the light was acted and stood its ground tolerably assisted by Mr Dyer in Sir Charles Buck Miss Nossiter the Lucinda Bellamy did not play that season except Almeria for the benefit of Mr Sparks in MarchMrs Woffington that year acted Lothario and the Frenchified Lady for her own benefit  That winter Mrs Gregory's fame had increased  o much in Ireland that she ventured over to play on shares a few nights at CoventGardenHer Calista did the most for her She had great merit an  much fireHer Hermione was in some scenes very capital  Mrs Gregory now Mrs Fitzhenry some years after tried DruryLane boards and was in  nded as a curb on Mrs Yates This was suspected by Mrs Yates's friends and the public and Mrs Fitzhenry's person stood no chance against the beautiful Mrs Yates's The Irish gentlemen were too sanguineIn consequence a violent opposition took place and Mrs Fitzhenry notwithstanding her good character and great  abilities was severely and cruelly treated A circumstance seldom happening from a London audienceBut what will not spleen effectThis had nearly proved of fatal consequence to her  ame as an actress in Dublin the ill report being  tr  bled  to greet her return But real worth and the high esteem she was held in by the worthy baffled her enemiesShe was soon reinstated in her former enviable situation of public applause and private esteem and for years her emoluments were such as to make happy the remainder of her days by a laudable and wellearned independence and she now lives beloved and feels the rapture of daily testimonies of regard paid to her unfullied reputation  Performers of the old and new school may here take a hint respe  ting Mrs  Fitzhenry  's good and ill treatment as it plainly shews how little the stability of the best audience is to be depended upon For in my space of memory I do not recollect a more favourable reception than was that lady's in Hermione and though of their own London planting yet malevolence party and spleen wished to cast her public merit and her private worth  like a loathsome weed away  Hence we may gather and surmise it is highly needful we should  urb our vanities  or every one has more or less so as to prevent the overpowering  our wits For the  entire  reliance on public favour it is plainly evident too much resembles trusting to what we judge the fast gripe of a strong s  ppery eel which is vanished when we fondly imagine it is most secure Audiences I fear resemble each other in a more or less degree all the world over and have like actors on the expanded stage of life their different change of opinions their caprices and their contradictions If that be really the case and that they do not know their own minds but are unsteady patronize one year and abandon the next what a flaming  prudent  beacon should it exhibit to theatrical reflection to warn against trusting too implicitly to public applause or of depending too far on our fancied or real abilities as too surely the breaths that raise can sink us and we who hold the mirror should recollect that in the wide world's drama the ring of fickle changes are wholly comprised in that established everrunning play called  The Follies of a Day  wherein all act their parts with applause approbation disgrace or sink into  oblivion  The stage with all its attractive brilliancies which at a certain time of life renders it improving and bewitching for in youth even its vexations are reconciled and connected with its pleasures yet in its highest meridian had I a dozen  ns it would be the last profession I should advise or wish  any one of them to adopt though I never would prevent genius or strong inclination in its pursuits for li  e to  many are called but few are chosen  My advanced reasons do not arise from a mean opinion of the art quite the reverse but from the too frequent affronts  as observed in my second volume its professors are often liable to receive from the supercil  ous and the domineering and what is more grating to feeling dispositions they are sometimes offered from those we have been taught t  believe and look on as what are termed friends and acquaintancesAnd surely it is the same composition of mind the same resolution and courage which make the greatest friendships and the greatest en  ties and he who is too lightly reconciled after high provocation which in a little time  I  really am may recommend himself to the world  s a Christian but should hardly  e trusted as a friend  he Italians I am told have a proverb to the purpose which is  "To forgive the first time shews a good man the second time a fool"  For I ve once past is at the best forgotten but  tener sours to hate  I have been led to this digression by the having someti es met with in  ul  ing superiority  uriting with dignity when perhaps such persons could not dictate a better letter than m felt nd that is bad enough every body knows It certainly  will be admitted as truly provoking to hear those who are neither possessed of talents wit or humour yet authoritatively as arrogantly casting sarcastic sneers but as Cibber observes the consolation should be that such illiberal behaviour seldom or never proceeds from persons remarkable for good qualitiesAnd assuredly such superficial critics should note that it would be con  dered rude not to add impudent in a degree were a player to tell an eminent brewer at table with a mixed company that his la  t ca  k of  allbeer was trashy or verjuice or the wine mer  ant that his wine was mu  ty or the woollen  per that his cloth was rotten for such real  will unavoidab  y happen to the most ing  ous and upright trader and there cannot be a  ore honourable or est  mable character The best mechanic is as often put out of his workman  hip by an unlucky wheel going wrong as plays from un  ore  een cau  es are too often illacted Besides good actors and actresses are not to be picked or gathered as easy as hops for very good  es are much scarcer than pine applesNor should a piece condemned by one snarler  as murdering his precious time  be admitted as a reason that others must think like him and neither approve nor applaud because such a play or  arce is condemned and labours unfortunately  under the disapprobation of one or more overbearing and dissatisfied critic And surely no great condescension even for the advantage o  untwisting the features if such flinty hearts were to yield and sometimes approve and shew a benevolent face as if actuated by  charitable motives  I am aware and sorry to say that it is next to impossible to avoid creating enemies and real judgment freely investigated I fear is more apt to err and be warped in the wisest understandings than will be readily allowed or admitted as to matters of opinion But my experience leads me to suggest that it is enforcedly implanted in our natures to be swayed by our interests and partial  t  es our likings and d  likings and too oft we know not why As for my own part I have frequently found it next to impossible when perchance on beholding t  o entire strangers boxing in the street or two game cocks fighting but that I impulsively an  as it were inconceivably have felt a pity and a strong pre  ilection in favour of one in preference to the other  Ruminating on theatric usage has however produced one good effect and affords comfort to my peace of mind when I consider that after a toilsome task of thirtythree years hard duty in the theatric field with many hairbreadth scapes I have been inured and reconciled to the  sufferings I have undergone from my fracture and severe illness which threatened dissolution as its consequences has relieved me from the  constant  stage acting before the period it would probably with consistency otherwise have happened And now I rehearse  solus  like Major Sturgeon and cry  "It is all over with meFarewell the plumed steeds and neighing troops as the black man in the play says for like the Roman  Censurer  I shall retire to my  Savine  field and cultivate cabbages"  and can say with Foote  Not but there are who merit all my care  Pleas'd to applaud benevolent to spare  And of such noble minds which are as nice in their judgments as in their censures they are light and right I of my audiences with truth can boast Now like a truant which I often was in my youth and old boy like I have stretched far beyond my bounds and justly fear the rod of deserved correction due on coming back to my proper place where I must as in duty bound repeat my task as well as I am able and turn back from my fault of digression to my account of the season at Covent Garden in  Mr Barry in the month of January attempted to encounter with the difficult character of Richard  the Third and am sorry to relate that he was lamentably deficient in every point in his representation of that spirited and designing monarch the which occasioned no little exultation to his rival Garrick  Mrs Stot a  ias Lesingham made her first appearance in Desdemona on Thursday November but quickly retired and did not appear on the stage again for a considerable time after  Mr Rich's Harlequinade of the Rape of Proserp  was also produced and attended with good fortune as it filled the houses for several nights to the we  kest plays  Douglas was  presented in February  and was w  ll but not greatly received or followed Mr Barry's performance was good but his figure too u  h for that of the stripling and he looked worse for the youth by havi  g o  rated the simpl  sh p  erd in

to see what has turned out so contrarythat Douglas is and will be for the credit of the stage a lasting ornament The story is simple natural and affecting its language elegant and beautiful and the lessons that may be observed from many passages are worthy the attention and retention of the learned the gay the giddy and the wise  I will here drop my Tablet as occurrences from this season begin my own particular stage  story to which volumes I re  er for many theatrical anecdotes  ither of others or myself The T  bl  t I have sketched to a considerable length  t being meant as an informant

SPECULUM  There I see my own FIGURE  A FOOL OR A CYPHER  A PREPARATORY  I TAKE for granted that it will be readily admitted any matter  resembling  good sense will be more gratifying and entertaining than my accumulated work I will therefore finish the combustibles which have existed within the distracted book and volume of my brain with a few letters from persons once on a time well known in lifeI have placed them so as to diversity and shall be highly pleased as well as honoured should they be complimented with the acceptance of the public and allowed to be passable and entertainingI have one plea to offer to my friends that may it is possible prove creative of pity and allowance which is that whilst I have been thus busily employed I have unluckily had domestic as well as numberless theatrical perplexities to struggle with added to pain and illness to disturb my mind though  blessed be God not my spirits  It is my fate of place and surely I cannot be in lack of troubles and vexations to make my blood circulate when the happier reader recollects I am the  manager of a theatre and a company of comedians  LETTERS  LETTER I TO TATE WILKINSON ESQ  I HAVE been reflecting this  half hour  and let me tell you that half an hour is a great while for a woman to reflect on the predominance of  selflove  The eloquence of Demosthenes the orations of Cicero would never have been known had they not been actuated by this  allruling principle  When the uncle of the younger Pliny fastened his pillows to his head and ascended the burning mountain did he risque his life for  curiosity  aloneNothe  universal passion  caused his death And what is love of  fame  but  selflove  When the beneficent man rescues merit from obscurity or old age from the stings of poverty what is his motive Why  selflove  If he did not find his passions more fully gratified by  dispensing  ric es than by  oarding  them the beneficent man had been a miserWhy did Cato fall on his sword while Utica was fr e Did he die to save or serve his country NoBut to submit to Caesar or to death was the humbling alternativehis pride chose the latter When Virgi  ius murd red his daughter was it from his love of Virtue No▪his hatred of Appius and his opposition to the Decemvirate power  were his darling passions When pretty Miss confines the goldfinch in an embellished cage and feeds it with her own dainty hand is it her love for the  bird  that prevails upon her to give herself this trouble No If she did not find her own amusements in its warblings the  "happy commoner"  would be left to seek its sustenance at large  I think Shaftesbury in his  Moral Inquiry into Virtue  has almost proved that there is no virtue at all that there is very little independent of  selfgratification  And does not that destroy its essence I half believe and till I see a miser part with his money merely because it would make another happy or a coquette cease to adorn her person that her rival may for once have an opportunity of eclipsing her I shall hardly be inclined to alter my opinion And pray Mrs Baker to  what motive  am I to attribute young having favoured me with the crude indigested sentiments I have just received Why to  selflove  to be sure I like to hear myself talk writing whatever occurs to one's mind  is  but talking you know the thoughts were naturally produced by a chain of ideas with which they were connected I am alone and throwing them on paper has diverted meBesides I had a mind to let you see I am not quite such a trifler as my last might bespeak me it began  with a  loud laugh  and ended with a  poole at quadrille  if I am not mistaken for I seldom  read  what I writeit is enough for other people to do thatAy and Heaven knows a great deal  too much  you sayThank you Sir that's generousI love my friend should be candid with meThe postman's tapa letter from Londonone from Mr WilkinsonI I kiss the seals  Yours c ELIZA BAKER  Edin  May  LETTER II TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  I THANK you my dear Sir for your congratulations on my arrival in Scotland where bythebye I have encountered more perils than in a v  yage to the Indiesnot to mention mountains precipices savage cata  acts and more savage men I was lo  ked up for hear a week in a village dirty dismal and desolate by a de  uge of snow  I think of quitting this town in three weeks at the farthest and shall certainly pay my homage to you in your kingdom of York but not with the least design of becoming your subject all my campaigns shall end with this place and my future operations be confined to my own principality I am glad to find that  your theatre stands its ground though you are so unfortunate as to hobble a little  I shall let you know by a line on what day I shall be likely to see you I beg my compliments to your amiable queen and the whole royal brood Believe me sincerely yours  SAMUEL FOOTE  Edinb  Feb  LETTER III TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  I AM extremely glad I did not answer your last letter but one because if I had it would have deprived me of the satisfaction of knowing that my seeming neglect had vexed you but it was occasioned by my going to Aberdeen where I staid three weeks saw a fine country made several agreeable acquaintances amongst whom were the  arl of Aberdeen and the Governor of Fort Augustus  "though last not least"  and brought home enough to make the pot boil  Mr Ross has been ill but we expect him every instant He has sent some people Buck is one of them the rest never bore arms with  martial men  and therefore I can tell you nothing of their prowess You shall have a particular account of all our state affairs for your amusement as they occur  I have had a very extraordinary letter from a  cousin of mine who keeps a shop about ten miles from London where he sells every thing has saved a good purse bought land and built houses What could the odd soul mean by such a proposal Perhaps he thought it would be doing his  noble  family an acceptable service if he transplanted one of its branches from the stage to the counter But it will not do I had rather be a primrose in the wilderness than a polyanthus in a hotbed A counter is by no means my natural soil though to be sure I might find some pretty amusements in his family and almost as many employments as Scrub had I might scold the maids dun the tenants and serve in the shop Do not you see me with Fontenelle in one hand and a cheesetaster in the other Then how comfortable to be seated on an excellent new pillion ambling to London in a holidayweek buttoned up close in a warm Joseph and upon arriving at a friend's house pull off this dainty garment let down my cherryderry gown my cousin sells cherriderries and my cambric apron the  equipping myself with a cardinal threequarters of a yard too long for the fashion and a rich handsome black satin bonnet be stuffed into the gallery at the playhouse my own pockets replete with gingerbread shrimps and oranges▪ and my little husband's provided with a bott  of charming rum punch If we can but get a front seat how delightfully will the time pass away till the play begins surrounded by such substantial blessings The honest man does not know what a favour I have done him in refusing him I suppose I shall have a few remonstrances from some of my wise uncles and aunts for I can guess who put such a project into the man's head I am sure it was not his own for in the first place I know his ideas could never reach from Surry to Edinburgh though all the cousins upon earth lived there and besides this he repeatedly assures me  that no mortal soul knows of his writing  but they may say what they please let me alone to answer them Now you are grumbling at me for plaguing you with such nonsense but what can I do You will not give me a subject and therefore you must be contented with such as I can findO by the waywhat took you to YorkYou are horridly provoking Mr Wilkinson but perhaps I may find a way to be even with youYet hang it men have not half the curiosity that women have at least they say so You see I have had patience a great while Dowson is at Newcastle he sent for the inimitable Robson thither and gave a very notable reason for so doinghe could not live without her Let me know in confidence what sort of woman Mrs  Roach isShe's here and I believe will be engaged  Why do you get up Salisbury It is a horrid playthe Novel is worth fifty of it Have you done Cymon It would certainly act well I admired it all in the reading except Urganda's end strong proof of its merit you will sayBut perhaps I had spoiled my taste for  toral at that time for I had just read Sid  ey's Ar  a  ia though I cannot say I was quite so enraptured w th i  as when I was a girlBut it is seven o'clock and I have another letter to write so adieu without any professions for I hate them and I should hate you if I thought you could have a doubt of my being with the most perfect sincerity  your unalterable and affectionate friend ELIZA BAKER  Edinburgh  Oct  I have heard here but I do not much respect my author that Mrs Roach is indelicate in conversation if so I shun her like a viperI do not think there can be a stronger proof of a corrupt heart I would sooner keep company with a woman of the town whose behaviour was decent than with a Diana in fact if I could not discourse with her without being frightened out of my wits every time she opened her lips  LETTER IV TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  DEAR TATE  WHEN I thought that you had quite forgot us behold I received a letter and a letter of a very comic kind Do you seriously believe that a man of my age and  great gravity  will turn pimp and  procure  a young girl for exportation  Mr Wilkinson had wrote to Mrs Chaigneau to engage a  actress  How could you imagine that I would undertake such a jobb when you have not even attempted to make it  worth my while  This is not an age to expect services without reward In short I must shift you from friend to friend I spoke to Mr Alderman Forbes who is the Lord Mayor once more and he sent his bellman about but he played me a devilish trick for next morning I had four thousand one hundred and eighteen wenches at my door to the great terror of all my neighbours However it has greatly raised my reputation with the ladies  I never go to a p  ay nor do I know the person of any one of them and am told I have no great loss One Dawson manages the puppe  s in Crowstreet and Mr Ryder in Smo  kAlley Sheridan and Macklin are here and have acted occasionally at high prices but this is almost over as they are in the middle of  their benefits As our parliament will be up in May the town will grow very thin Indeed we should all be glad to see you and Mrs Wilkinson and believe you cannot fail amongst us of having a tolerable bed with bread cheese and smallbeer  Mr Acheson is now in the gout but will write soon All my family join me in kind compliments to Mrs Wilkinson and believe me dear Tate your faithful  affectionate servant W CHAIGNEAU  Dublin  Mar  LETTER V TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  HA ha haBe all attentionThe highest adventureNoyou may untwist your features from the  furl curious  for hang me if you shall have a word of it yetit is too good for the  beginning  of a letter but it is a noble subject for the  end  of oneI love to have a letter and a sermon conclude as a journey in a stagecoach does with a  smack  and a  spirited tight flourish  or as Captain Bobadil has it with a  punto  or within short with any other phrase you like betterHow strangely have you jumbled together  Providence workmanship admiration  and  monkeys  Let me see if I cannot put it into a little method for you  and produce a wellturned compliment Suppose  me  speaking for  you  now and addressing myself to some fair ladythe agreeable Mrs Baker suppose  "  Nature  Madam  Nature  is a much cleverer word in this place than  Providence  Nature when she formed your Ladyship lavished on you her choicest excellencies and displayed the glorious workmanship as a perfect pattern of her art and a proper object of  universal admiration  a  sensible  an  adorable  an  amiable woman  But  me  Lord Madam she took a quite contrary course with  me  the sly  ipsey made  me  a  man  Madam"  Therenow it is in a much better form and  manman  is an infinitely more suitable word than  monkey  that is when used as a term of reproach as I will demonstrate A monkey makes us  laugh  a man oftener makes us  cry  A monkey breaks our  china  a man breaks our  heart  A monkey plays his tricks in order to  amuse  us a man sometimes plays tricks which are not  amusing  at all We  command  the monkey the man presumes to  command  us but in revenge we  dispute  his commands seldom  relish  them and  very  seldom  obey  them I have often seen a monkey by a pat of its pretty paw procure a kiss and a lump of sugar from its mistress and I have known the same lady refuse her husband  a trifling favour though made with complacency and urged with politeness  ergo  she thought the monkey the more deserving and  nobler  animal You have so often and so strenuously disclaimed all attempts to compliment that I dare not accuse you of it and I fancy you will not give me an inclination to do so in a hurry for fear I should oppress you with as powerful a torrent of nonsense as that you have just encountered withWould you believe that I have been asked by several gentlemen here who prof  ss a regard for me to write a novel They have promised five hundred subscribers but as I choose not to lose the good opinion they have of my abilities I do not intend to expose myself to the mortification of convincing them that I do not  deserve it  Take care of yourself Mr WilkinsonStand out of my way SirI have just mounted my  hobbyhorse  today  I may be tired of the least perhaps  tomorrow  and shall gallop and prance and frisk about at a de  perate rate I therefore repe  t if you have not a mind to be horridly sp  ashed  stand out of my way  What can  e the meaning of this stupid rhapsody Lord how foolish that is n w Why if you interrupt me I shall never finish my  career  I less n e Sir  "I never had a lover yet above half his age"  and pray let me introduce  the poor man with a  pomp  sity  suitable to his  reverence  And give me leave to tell you Sir that we ought to  respect  age that it is by no means a subject for  ridicule  and that we must  all  live to be  old  if we do not die when we are  young  I make no apology for introducing these sentiments because I am certain they are extremely  edifying  and very  new  However such offers do not come every day an estate of l a year and my ladyship to have been exalted to the Highlandsa pretty mansiona paternal onea little in the Gothic style indeed but agreeably situated and replete with conveniences defended from the north by a  hill  adorned on the south by a woodas

been mischievous enough to have  married  him for I should have had a mean opinion of my  conjugal tenderness  if I had not led him such a  dance  and turned his  Gothic mansion  so topsyturvy that after a tiresome journey of about a  month  Oh it could not have been so  long  as a month the poor soul should have reposed himself quietly in the  urn of his ancestors  One  serious  wordMay the bare  thought  of  marrying  a man with the hopes of  burying  him be far far from the heart of your  friend  ELIZA BAKER  Edinb  April  My next shall be devoted to business at present I have an hundred engagements and am in too great spirits to attend to itI must goAdieuMattadores and favourite every deal or I would not give sixpence for it  LETTER VI TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  As I presume you are come from London I send to you to entreat you to turn your postchaise  immediately  towards this metropolis where your presence will be as it always will be to me most welcome and acceptable  Some of the first personages here with every friend I have have long since advised me to wipe off a long score of old and I may add imposing and fraudulent demands by taking the benefit of the Scottish act of insolvencyI am now at last about to do soThis crisis will relieve me of many untoward straits in which two large bailbonds which I signed for Mrs Bellamy who I shall ever mention with respect and compassion continually involved me A few days will end this matter in the interim as the season here is now beginning when money ever used to come into the house I know no moment in which you can be of more substantial and critical use to YOURSELF or  me  and that I may introduce your aid in the strongest and kindest manner possible I will when you come tell the public in whose favour I stand in the best light that you visit this spot to support me in my  temporary difficulty  I am certain as Foote has not been here these two years that you will attract the utmost  notice  but catch the tide of success  I know you need no advice about the tide of kindness  Often very often have I repeated the favour to myself of drinking the health you thank me forNow you have no need to thank me for doing what I am sure was meant to be done without your  hearing  of it  I have a good companyWhen Douglas was under difficulties he called upon Percy for his aid and as Home's prologue says  For  Douglas Percy bent  his English  bow  So hasten with your abilities which are arrows that never miss I am sincerely your obedient  W DIGGES  Jan  LETTER VII TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  DEAR SIR  BE assured it was very far from my intentions to  half  vex you or to give you the least reason to suspect that I imagined you wanted delicacy In all my transactions public or private my chief objects are tranquility and reputation I have no dislike to  money  but if  that  cannot be acquired with more than an equal share of the  other two why then let money go to the devil  for I ever prefer my  private  to my  public character  Mr Weston has a tolerable share of the last without a grain of the first  therefore I resolve against all concerns with him but when  unavoidable  As to that gentleman's performing on the th for Mr Raworth I can have no objection as I would wish to promote his interest rather than slacken it though he must be meaner then I think him if he plays at York for  five guineas  and especially after your absolute injunction to Raworth to assure Weston that he will  deceive himself  if he thinks of GETTING MORE Let the transaction proceed upon that ground and I think it will be for the advantage of  all parties  I resove if nothing unforeseen prevents to turn my back upon Edinburgh on Thursday the th at noon so as to be able to sleep on the southern side of the Tweed then I fancy I may be able to come into York to a late dinner on Saturday and that I may not be  smoaked  by any of the theatrical gentry my first dinner there shall be at an inn  You know my  forcible  characters as well as I doyou know the taste of the public where you preside and therefore make choice of plays and characters that seem most advantageous in your own judgment I am told your catalogue of plays far exceeds any of our theatres royal and if that be true when we meet we shall not be at a loss to choose  Notwithstanding you seem to be tired of the correspondence I am resolved not to finish it so soon perhaps as you expect and therefore call upon you for three or four plays and farces that you would recommendin  London  I would determine in  York  YOU shallthe greater the contrasts the more agreeable I suppose to your audience yourself and  Dear Sir  yours sincerely c HEN WOODWARD  Edinburgh  Mar  P S Pray do not forget my compliments to Mr Swan and if you will introduce me to Mrs Wilkinson a fortnight or three weeks  before I see her  by  Jasus  my  sowl  I should  estame  it as a very great favour  LETTER VIII TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  SIR  I AM sorry it is not in my power to comply with your request to send you the corrections lately made in Hamlet but no such favour can be granted to any one as I presume the play will never be printed so altered as the  are far from being universally approved nay in general greatly disliked by the milliontherefore  no doubt your country 'squires would be for horsewhipping the actor that had struck out that natural scene of the gravediggers  As to alterations there are few or none at least  additions  which alone make material alterations I can therefore tell you the first act being remarkably long great part of it is carried into the secondand the sending Hamlet to England and the gravedigging scene is by that means cut out and the introducing the scene that has been long omitted where Hamlet intercepts the officer at the head of a party going to engage the enemy for a bit of land  That  scene restored and the division of the first act makes ample amends for what is cut out  No doubt Hamlet's consenting to go to England and being prevented and brought back by a miracle is altogether absurd when his solemn engagement with his father's ghost is duly considered However as I have already observed the million will like nay understand Shakspeare with all his glorious absurdities nor suffer a bold invader to cut them up  I shall be very glad to see you when you come next to London and at all times to do you any service in the power of Sir  your most humble servant B VICTOR  LETTER IX TO TATE WILKINSON  Esq  DEAR TATE  IT is now a considerable time since I wrote to my good friend Sir John O'Carroll and informed him of all the misfortunes that have happened to my family and requested that he would be so good to let you know of them As I have received no answer I am really very uneasy particularly as I mentioned something that nearly concerned his interest I must therefore request that you will inquire about it and inform me  I was in France near a year with my wife and Mrs Forbes whom I left at Montauban and got home in June My poor nephew Jack had been a long time ill and was then at Mallow Waters Alderman Forbes went to visit his wife in October last but the ship was dashed to pieces in Wales and he and many others were lost In March last my dear Jack exchanged this life for a better and was soon followed by his brokenhearted mother and your good friend my poor brother Acheson You may easily conceive the distraction of our family My brother John has been much affected and my niece Hannah is I fear in a dangerous situation from the immense fatigue she had with her brother and mother  My dear sister Forbes could not support her loss and last June she followed her husband This is too melancholy a subject to dwell on I know you feel for us all Mrs Chaigneau and Mrs Acheson who lives with me and all the remainder of your old friends desire to be remembered to you in the kindest manner and believe me  Dear Tate  your very sincere servant W CHAIGNEAU  Dublin  Aug  LETTER X TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  DEAR SIR  IF I had not a pretty shrewd knack at guessing it would not be quite so easy a matter to answer your favour from Hull  You desire to know if I had commissioned Giordini to give a particular sum but whether to a horse a man or a woman does not appear for this or the next summer  Your old friend Shuter is locked up in the playhouse and is soliciting a letter of licence from his creditors in which number I find Jewel is included for ten guineas borrowed during the last season Fye upon him I am glad to hear that your affairs prosper I have a piece of three acts not my own which I shall give  in the month of May called the  Tailors  The subject is a rich onethe dispute between the masters and the journeymen of that respectable professionand I think the author has done it exquisite justice It is a parody of the best passages in the most favourite plays conveyed with great gravity in blank verseI think you will appear in it to advantage and I shall be glad of your assistance I cannot say I am quite so well as I had reason to expect I thought myself obliged to give Barry a lift two critical nights which injured me extremely but I am now better and except the trifle of a leg as much yours as ever  SAM FOOTE  Nov  LETTER XI TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  I thank you for the florid beginning of your last letter but one though I can neither admire the delicacy of the sentiment nor subscribe to the truth of the observation For Heaven's sake why should not women be as desirous of sincere professions as men are Or why should not even an indirect falsity told to the former be held as scandalous as it is acknowledged to be when offered to the latterWould not that man be thought the veriest  poltroon  in nature who should draw his sword upon one who had  lost the use of his handsWhat then can we say of him who by arguments equally  specious  and  false  shall endeavour to impose upon a defenceless  woman  who has neither understanding enough to repel his attacks nor a possibility of revenging themSo much for  sincerity  my dear Wilkinson And be assured I have at least sense enough to prefer it when it is attended neither by illnature nor rudeness to all the refinements which the most subtile politeness divested of it can dictate  I have had a miserable cold or I should have wrote to you  before  do not grumble at this for I am so horridly out of spirits you may thank me for writing to you  now  Beatt has taken himself to his brother's in Fifeshire and lives secured from duns upon the fat of a lean land The magnanimous Staley was left behind us in Edinburgh where he is employed in writing madrigals to his own praise  sad  ones they are indeedMr is gone to Aberdeen to paint miniatures which the originals may  fancy  copies of  themselves  and Lancashire draws beer opposite St Mary's Wynd So that you see our company is but thin yet we have found our quarters here extremely good indeed much better than could have been expectedI am sorry to hear you are inclined  to gallopdepend upon it my friend you are got upon a sober demure beast that will not bear to be pranced with take care then how you put him out of his pace for fear he should throw you out of the saddleI have no inclination to make this letter longer take it therefore by way of  bon bouche  you shall have a full meal presentlyThe conclusion of a letter often occasions more trouble than all the rest of it therefore as I am vastly inclined to be idle you must take for granted all the esteem regard friendship and affection which are usually  expressed  when you read the name of  ELIZA BAKER  I do not know what you mean by your emphatic inquiry in regard to Mr B He is very wellbut I should be sorry if you could imagine me capable of preferring a new acquaintance to an old oneor that there is a man in the world who has power to alter the  real  the  warm  friendship which I have for Mr Wilkinson  LETTER XII TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  IF I had not been greatly engaged by playing every night and studying two or three parts yet I have an excuse for my silence from the impertinent  conclusion of your last letter  Every thing  must be impertinent in friendship which is not  sincere  For Heaven's sake why will you be perpetually teizing me with the idea of my superiority which when you have said all you can is  but  an ideaI look upon  politeness  properly defined to be only another name for  humanity  which can scarcely exist independent of the strictest truth In conformity to this sentiment you will not wonder if I tell you that the compliment you have paid me in your last is not only  impolite  but  inhuman  because I am sensible I do not deserve it there is no truth in it And can a generous mind suffer a more degrading mortification than from the having those merits ascribed to it which it is conscious it by no means deservesTherefore for the future a little more  sincerity  and fewer your  professions  I beseech you Sir  You tell me if I come to York I must have many disagreeable things to encounter But you may believe me when I assure you with the strictest veracity that Mr Wilkinson's conversation and  friendship  would enable me to bear them extremely well without any amazing share of either  sense philosophy  or  good humour  However it will be some time before I can tell you my fixed resolves but let them be of what  nature they will I suppose you can have no objection to my paying my compliments to yourself as I pass through Newcastle or York in my way to London a little time henceAdieuWhat satisfaction would it be to me if I thought my arrival in Newcastle would give you half the pleasure that it will afford to  ELIZA BAKER  Glasgow  July  LETTER XIII TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  Do you know that our correspondence begins to grow extremely criticalThe people here wonder what we can write about so constantly and really make some remarks which are pretty enoughYour last letter but one was directed to Glasgow and returned to me from thence on the same day that I received your mad oneboth at the playhouse toothen what an uproar  "Good God Mrs Baker What two letters from Mr Wilkinson in one dayboth long ones tooBless me what can he find to write aboutSure you must have found him an interesting subjectwe always thought Mr Wilkinson the idlest correspondent in the world"  What answer do you think I give to all thisWhy as Lady Betty says I hate malicious people so in order to afford their curiosity all the satisfaction it deservesI just raise  my eyes from the paper and look at them with a vacant stare as if I was sensible  something  had been said but was too much absorbed by the contents of my letter to know  what  then fold it up carefully deposit it in my pocket with great circumspection figure out of the greenroom with a  "God bless me how extraordinary For Heaven's sake Dick hasten the rehearsal for I want to go home and write immediately"  then returning  "What were you all talking of just now but I do not care what  I am in that harmony of spirits it is impossible to put me out of humour  "  But as it would be unnatural for a woman to appear  always  pleased for fear they should suspect me of artifice or of an  intention  to heighten their impatience for our mighty secret I sometimes sit sullen after reading a letterbite my lipsread it againthen exclaim in a whisper loud enough to be heard you may be sure  "Unaccountable" and if any of them pretend to rally me or want to know what is the matter"  I begup n my word it is very rudei  you  had met with any thin to make you uneasy  should not think myself excusable in teazing you"  Ha ha hadon t y u  ee itAnd can you blame me for playing t us with their impertinent curiosityHeavens send I may  not drop one of these mysterious lettersfor what a terrible figure would the poor mouse make if the mountainous secret should be blown up  I am very angry with you for your debauch you think that is the way to establish your health Dear Wilkinson take care of yourselfI have a thousand things to say which can be only saidMr Bland and Mr Didier are in the room and have talked to me so much that they have  bliterated every idea of what I intended to say I am so bothered that I am not even able to tell you that you have not a friend in the world that esteems you so much as  ELIZA BAKER  Edinburgh  TO THE READER  A Considerable mistake having taken place in this Work my duty calls on me to explain it in this conclusive page  It is relating to the  rank  I have affixed to the name of Thornton and dubbing him Colonel of the  Yorkshire Blues  where it was not right to do so My being an entire stranger to the county of York at the time I was honoured with the acquaintance of the gentleman alluded to in my early pa  t of l  fe gave rise to the e  regious blunder  ut tho' I have unfortunately lost my patron General St Leger who could have prevented my being so wrong yet I am so lucky as to be set right by the favour of a letter o  undoubted authenti  ty from a gentleman of rank and fortune to whom I am highly indebted for his infinite politeness it is as follows  TO TATE WILKINSON Esq  DEAR SIR  I should be happy if I could give you the least assistance relative to the matter you have wrote to me about I can only speak from memory and my then knowledge of the army  I was at that time at Portsmouth Sir Robert Rich's regiment of dragoons to which I then belonged was all in Scotland except the light troop which marched into England on Thurot with his fleet appearing off our northern coast and I marched with it as Lieutenant in Septem I knew Capt Anthony St Leger in the d or King's own regiment of dragoons who was then at Portsmouth with the light troop of that regiment I am confident there then was not a colonel or lieutenant colonel Thornton belonging the horse at Portsmouth or in the English service at that time If I recollect right there was only one field officer appointed to command the light troops upon the expedition that went out that summer against Cherbourg which was Major George Warde of the th dragoons now Lieutenant General Warde In every regiment of heavy dragoons had a light troop belonging to it which were detached corps in order to be sent upon those expeditions so that each troop had only a captain lieutenant and cornet sent with it  You are mistaken with regard to the rank of the gentleman you mention There was at that time a  Lieut William Thornton  of the th dragoons who was there and went upon the expedition he was a man universally known and beloved by  every body who knew him He had lived much in the world was very much of a gentleman and very sensible but was rather partial to his bottleI wish to be as particular as possible as I think he was the person you mean He was about thirty years of age about five feet eight inches high handsome face and well madeThere was a circumstance happened upon that expedition Captain Lindsay of the th dragoons was killed and General Bligh who commanded upon the expedition and had power given him by his Majesty to fill all vacancies that should happen in the army appointed  Lieutenant William Thornton  to a troop in the th dragoons which he commanded till they returned to Portsmouth where Lord Newbottle now Marquis of Lothian came to command the troop being appointed to it by his Majesty the th dragoons being then his father's Lord Ancram's regimentThe circumstance was much talked of in the army as Thornton would not return to his former regiment or rankThe latter end of that year we had in our regiment a captain who died and Thornton was appointed captain in his room Thornton died in London in I remember Captain St Leger afterwards Major General St Leger was very intimate with Thornton  Colonel Thornton father to the present Colonel Thornton of the militia who was member for York used to be distinguished by being called  of the  Yorkshire Blues raising a company of men who were  lothed in blue in the time of the rebe  lion with which he marched into Scotland  THE END  FAREWELLREMEMBER ME
