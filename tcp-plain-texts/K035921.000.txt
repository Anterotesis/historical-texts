 AN ACCOUNT OF THE INSTITUTION and PROGRESS OF THE ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC WITH A COMPARATIVE VIEW of the MUSIC of the PAST and PRESENT TIMES BY A MEMBER ESTO PERPETUA Padre PAOLO SARPI  LONDON Printed in the YEAR MDCCLXX  AN ACCOUNT OF THE ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC  THE Academy of Ancient Music at the Crown and AnchorTavern in the Strand was instituted about the year by a number of Gentlemen performers on different instruments in conjunction with some of the most eminent masters of the time The design of this establishment was to promote the study and practice of vocal and instrumental  harmony in order to which the foundation of a library was laid consisting of the most celebrated compositions as well in manuscript as in print that could be procured either at home or abroad  Under the direction of the late Dr  John Christopher Pepusch  whose memory will be ever revered by all lovers of music and with the assistance of Mr  Galliard  Dr  Maurice Greene  Mr  Bernard Gates  and the gentlemen and boys of St Paul's Cathedral and the Chapel Royal the Academy continued in a very flourishing state till about the year when Dr  Greene  thought proper to leave it and set up an Academy at the DevilTavern Templebar which subsisted but a few years  The secession of Dr  Greene  and his dependents was not such an injury to the Academy as it was feared it would prove they left it it is true but they left it in peace and the members of which it was composed in consequence of the loss they had sustained became emulous to excel each other in their endeavours to promote its interests and to disseminate the love of harmony throughout the kingdom  With these assistances and that which the Academy derived from the performance of the amiable  Henry Needler    Esq  who for many years led the orchestra the late Earl of  Abercorn  Mr  Mulso  Mr  Millan  Mr  Dobson  and many other gentlemen who were excellent performers it continued to  flourish until the year when Mr  Gates  retired and drew off with him the children of the Chapel Royal  In the interval between the secession of Dr  Greene  and Mr  Gates  viz in the Month of February the Academy had given a signal proof of the advantages arising from its institution the Oratorio of Esther originally composed for the duke of  Chandois  was performed in character by the members of the Academy and the children of the Chapel Royal and the applause with which it was received suggested to Mr  Handel  the thought of exhibiting that species of composition at CoventGarden theatre and to this event it may be said to be owing that the public have not only been delighted  with the hearing but are now in possession of some of the most valuable works of that great master  The loss which the Academy sustained by the secession of some members the death of others and above all by the want of boys laid them under great difficulties and drove them to the necessity of trying what could be done without the assistance of treble voices but the experience of one season drove them to the alternative of an encreased expence or annihilation In this predicament they resolved upon an expedient that should not only make good the loss they had sustained but convey a benefit to posterity In short they determined upon such an establishment  nd such a subscription as would  render the Academy at once a society for the entertainment of its members and a seminary for the instruction of youth in the principles of music and the laws of harmony Invitations to parents and offers of such an education for their children as would fit them as well for trades and businesses as the profession of music were given by advertisements in the public papers these brought in a great number of children and such of them as were likely to be made capable of performing the  Soprano  part in vocal compositions were retained Dr  Pepusch  generously undertook the care of their instruction for a stipend the largest the Academy could afford tho' greatly disproportionate to his merit and succeeded so well in his endeavours to improve them that some of the  most eminent professors of the science owe their skill and reputation to his masterly method of tuition  A subscription of two guineas and a resolution to admit auditors as members enabled the managers to carry this their benevolent design into execution they enriched their collection with such a variety of compositions as rendered it even then perhaps the most valuable repository of musical treasure in Europe Abbate  Steffani  transmitted to them from Hanover the most valuable of his works from time to time as they were composed Mr  Handel  and Signor  Geminiani  lent the Academy their countenance the latter frequently honouring it with his own exquisite performance and it continued to flourish till the year when it sustained  a loss which will be long deplored in the death of Dr  Pepusch  and which was far from being repaired by his generous benefaction to it of the most valuable part of his library  Soon after this melancholy event some of the members of the Academy reflecting on the great encouragement given to  Concerts  thought it might tend to the interest of the Society to give it a new form and by engaging some of the most excellent performers on particular instruments derive assistance to it as a  Concert  from persons who might be apt to disregard it as an  Academy  But here they were involved in a new difficulty the great increase of late years in the number of places of public diversion and the consequent  increase in the demands of eminent performers made it impossible even with a subscription of two guineas and a half to continue a competition against greater resources than private contribution and they now find that these latter are not adequate to the expence of the plan which they last adopted  The members of the Academy therefore find themselves reduced to the necessity of recurring to the principles of its first institution and they desire if possible to perpetuate the existence of a Society calculated for the improvement of one of the noblest of the sciences and the communication of rational and social delight to which end they wish for the assistance of those who profess to love and admire music such as are susceptible of its powers  such in short as are capable of distinguishing between the feeble efforts of simple melody and the irresistible charms of elegant modulation and wellstudied harmony  The friends of this institution are sensible of the prejudices which its very name The Academy of Ancient Music may excite and that those persons who think no music can be good which is not  new  will hardly be induced to join in the support of an establishment professedly intended for the study and practice of that which is  old    To obviate prejudices of this kind little more is necessary than barely to state them those now under consideration are reducible to the following two positions  Nothing in music is estimable that is not new No music tolerable which has been heard before  In answer to which it may be said that this kind of reasoning is never applied to other intellectual gratifications for no man was ever yet so weak as to object to the works of  Virgil  or  RaffaÃ«lle  that the one wrote seventeen hundred or that the other painted two hundred and fifty years ago  But perhaps nothing more is meant by the objection than that  the efficacy of music is abated by repetition  Not to enquire what kind of music that must be the merit whereof evaporates in the performance let it be asked does any man forbear  the perusal of an Epic Poem merely because he has read it before or does any admirer of Painting or Sculpture withdraw his eye from a fine Picture or Statue because it has once surveyed them Nay rather does he not employ all his attention to explore their several beauties and in the exercise of a learned curiosity find continual delight  Again let it be asked are these objections to the best music of the best times founded in truth and experience or are they the result of a vicious taste and a depraved judgment Much of the music now in the possession of the Academy is as new to us as it was to our fathers and will any one in his sober senses assert that they had not ears and rational souls as well as ourselves  or that those sweet interchanges of melody those artful combinations of concordant sounds which inspired such men as  Shakespeare  and  Milton  with the praises of this divine science can at any time be heard with indifference by a nice and unprejudiced ear If this be the case music the principles whereof seem interwoven in the very constitution of the universe is mere delusion and the pleasure arising from it resolvable into caprice fashion into any thing but reason and philosophy  Farther let it be enquired how far the love of novelty has contributed to the  variety  of music and it will be found to have excluded some of the most valuable kinds of composition and thereby produced  uniformity  instead of  variety    Every judge of music is aware of the effects of compositions in the  minor  third of the several keys and that by the hearing of such the sweetest sensations are excited and the artful contexture of  fugue  and  canon  are the admiration of all who are skilled in the science These two kinds of music are in danger of being lost for the compositions of this day are almost solely in the  major  third and their structure little better than divided counterpoint and what is still worse on a  monotonic  bass nor are the compositions which some affect to admire less liable to the objection of uniformity in respect to their several  divisions  or strains For reasons which no one is willing to avow AdagioMusic is exploded and we are content to forego the Majesty and Dignity of the  Largo  and  Andant  movements with all the variety arising from the interchange of different airs and measures for the noise and rattle of an unisonus  Allegro  to which no name can be given or the intoxicating softness of that too oft iterated air the  Minuet    He that reflects on such instances of modern Levity as these and that the effect of new productions is such as that no one pretends or even wishes to remember the music that pleased him a month ago may very reasonably demand who are the competitors with the composers of the last century and the former half of the present or of which of them can it be said that his crudities are less evanescent than the form of a cloud or that his most laboured studies have survived the fate of an almanac  But lest it should be imagined that an unwarrantable fondness for antiquity is the motive with the Academy for the cultivation of ancient music they desire it may be understood that they apply the epithet  ancient  to the compositions of the  sixteenth  century  In order to understand the reason of this restriction it is necessary to advert to the history of music which so far as is material to the present purpose is this About the year  Gafurius  or as he is otherwise called  Franchinus  a native of Lodi in Italy having with great pains and expence procured copies and translations of  Aristides Quintilianus Bacchius Senioris Manuel Bryennius Ptolomey  and others of the Greek Musicians and having thoroughly studied  Boetius  and  Guido Aretinus  red lectures on music in the public schools of Mantua Verona Milan and other provinces and cities in Italy The ProvenÃ§al  violars  and  musars  were almost the only composers and musicians of the preceding ages but the knowledge of the science which  Gafurius  diffused throughout Italy gave rise to a new species of composition of which under the patronage of the Roman Pontiffs  Palestrina  is supposed to have been the improver if not the inventor the nature whereof is best to be judged of by his motet  Exaltabo te Domine  and his no less excellent madrigal  Veramente in amore  He was organist and chapelmaster of St Peter at Rome  nd flourished about the year The improvements in music since his time consist in the associat  ng instruments with voices and the invention of new  ombinations which without transgressing the laws  f harmony are supposed to be capable of an almost  finite variety  and that  they carry their researches no farther back than the time when  Palestrina  and his contemporaries those glorious luminaries of the musical world attracted the admiration of the ablest judges and that they have ever paid a sedulous attention to such productions as their intrinsic merit has at any period rendered worthy of regard  After so much care and pains taken to enrich it it will hardly be objected to the Academy collection of music that it is deficient in variety and when it is known  that the countries of Italy Germany France Spain the Netherlands and England have severally contributed and that very largely to the forming it very little dread will remain of that satiety or indifference which attends the hearing of music calculated for the  present hour  and not intended for posterity For not to mention the great number of compositions which the Academy are possessed of even so great as that the youngest person now living might hope in vain to hear them all nor that variety of stile observable in them which is the characteristic of different masters every species of vocal and instrumental music is in its turn exhibited by the Academy in the entertainment of its members the general arrangement of these is into compositions for the  church  the  theatre  and the  chamber  the first head includes Masses Motets Anthems Hymns and Psalms the second Oratorio's Masques Serenatas Overtures and Concerto's and the third Madrigals Trio's Duetto's and Cantata's to the true and just performance whereof the Academy have hitherto been and with the assistance which they now solicit trust they shall yet be equal  The hopes of success in these their endeavours arise from that propensity which they observe in people of this country to the cultivation of the politer arts and the general encouragement it affords to laudable pursuits They behold with pleasure persons of the first rank in this kingdom associated for the improvement of a particular species of vocal harmony and with  exemplary munificence dispensing rewards proportioned to the merit of such as are emulous to excel in it Farther they repose great confidence in the good sense of this nation of which they have a convincing proof in the respect which for a succession of ages has been paid to the works of our great Dramatic Poet of  Elizabeth  's days whose best compositions by the way are as liable to reproach on the score of their antiquity as any of those which the Academy have long laboured to recommend In short they flatter themselves that the studies of such men as  Palestrina Tallis Bird Carissmi Colonna Stradella Purcell Bassani Gasparini Lotti Steffani Marcello Buononcini Pergolesi Handel Perez  and many others abounding in evidences of the deepest skill and  finest invention when duly attended to will be thought worthy the admiration of every musical ear and afford a manly and rational delight to all the votaries of this noble science  A society founded on principles like these can hardly fail of proving an inexhaustible fund of benefit and entertainment Here the student in the musical faculty will find the means of forming his stile after the most perfect models Here the timid and modest performer may acquire that degree of firmness  nd confidence which is necessary for displaying his excellencies in public Here the ingenuous youth who prefers the innocent pleasures  f music to riot and intemperance may taste of that mirth which draws  o repentance after it and hither  may those repair to whom the studies or labours of a day must necessarily endear the elegant delights of a musical evening  Padre  Paolo Sarpi  resigned his breath with a prayer for the Republic of Venice which it is to be hoped every friend of the Muses applying it to the Academy of Ancient Music will adopt and in the words of that excellent man cry out  ESTO PERPETUA
