Obelisks and Urns  Of high Relief can the long spreading Lake  Or Vista lessening to the Sight can  Stow  With all her  Attic  Fanes such Raptures raise  As the Thrushhaunted Copse where lightly leaps  The fearful Fawn the rustling Leaves along  And the brisk Squirrel sports from Bough to Bough  While from an hollow Oak the busy Bees  Hum drowsy Lullabies The Bards of old  Fair Nature's Friends

Urn and husht his Waves  Rich in her weeping Country's Spoils  Versailles  May boast a thousand Fountains that can cast  The tortur'd Waters to the distant Heav'ns  Yet let me choose some Pinetopt

the Grove's Bosom Spires emerge and Smoak  In bluish Wreaths ascends ripe Harvests wave  Herds low and Strawrooft Cotts appear and Streams  Beneath the Sunbeams twinkleThe shrill Lark  That wakes the

Author has ventur'd to take some Hints in the following Lines from  Lucretius  's Description of the uncivilized State of Man which is one of the finest Pieces of Poetry extant  Glandiferas inter

whither God of Raptures art thou fled  While Avarice waves his golden Wand around  Abhorr'd Magician and his costly Cup  Prepares with baneful Drugs t'enchant the Souls  Of each lowthoughted Fair to

Mossgrown Caves to rove  Houseless and cold in dark tempestuous Nights  Yet  Lucretius  after beautifully describing the Evils that attended the barbarous State of Man proceeds to speak of their Advantages in the following Lines which are attempted to be translated  At non multa virûm sub signis millia ducta  Una dies dabat exitio nec turbida ponti  Aequora laedebant naves ad saxa virosque

the Lays of artful  Addison  Coldly correct to  Shakespear  's Warblings wild  Whom on the winding  Avon  's willow'd Banks  Fair Fancy found and bore the smiling Babe  To a close Cavern still the Shepherds shew  The sacred Place whence with religious Awe  They hear returning from the Field at Eve  Strange Whisperings of sweet Music thro' the Air  Here as with Honey gather'd from the Rock  She fed the little Prattler and with Songs  Oft' sooth'd his wondering Ears with deep Delight  On her soft Lap he sat and caught the Sounds  Oft' near some crowded City would I walk  Listening the faroff Noises rattling Carrs  Loud Shouts of Joy sad Shrieks of Sorrow Knells  Full slowly tolling Instruments of Trade  Striking mine Ears with one deepswelling Hum  Or wandering near the Sea attend the Sounds  Of hollow Winds and everbeating Waves  Ev'n when wild Tempests swallow up the Plains  And  Boreas'  Blasts big Hail and Rains combine  To shake the Groves and Mountains would I sit  Pensively musing on th' outragious Crimes  That wake Heav'n's Vengeance at such solemn Hours  Daemons and Goblins thro' the dark Air shriek  While  Hecat  with her blackbrow'd Sisters nine  Rides o'er the Earth and scatters Woes and Deaths  Then too they say in drear  Aegyptian  Wilds  The Lion and the Tiger prowl for Prey  With Roarings loud the list'ning Traveller  Starts Fearstruck while the hollowechoing Vaults  Of Pyramids encrease the deathful Sounds  But let me never fail in cloudless Nights  When silent  Cynthia  in her silver Car  Thro' the blue Concave slides when shine the Hills  Twinkle the Streams and Woods look tipt with Gold  To seek some level Mead and there invoke  Old Midnight's Sister Contemplation sage  Queen of the rugged Brow and sternfixt Eye  To lift my Soul above this little Earth  This Follyfetter'd World to purge my Ears  That I may hear the rolling Planets Song  And tunefulturning Spheres If this debarr'd  The little  Fayes  that dance in neighbouring Dales  Sipping

round and rosy Neck  Her flowing Train and long ambrosial Hair  Breathing rich Odours I enamour'd view  O who will bear me then to Western Climes  Since Virtue leaves our wretched Land to Shades  Yet unpolluted with  Iberian  Swords  With simple  Indian  Swains that I may hunt  The Boar and Tiger thro'  Savannah  's wild  There fed on Dates and Herbs would I despise  The farfetch'd Cates of Luxury and Hoards  Of narrowhearted Avarice nor heed  The distant Din of the tumultuous World  So when rude Whirlwinds rouze the roaring Main  Beneath fair  Thetis  sits in coral Caves  Serenely gay nor sinking Sailors Cries  Disturb her sportive Nymphs who round her form  The light fantastic Dance or for her Hair  Weave rosy Crowns or with according Lutes  Grace the soft Warbles of her honied Voice
