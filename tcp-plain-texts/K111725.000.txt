visibly on their living in Society and of Course under Subjection to Laws of which the shortest and the clearest Proof is this that Men are alike miserable under the two extremes of Tyranny and Anarchy both of which are Privations of Law and consequently of Government The Operation of Laws with respect to the Welfare of Society depends upon their Execution and this infers the Necessity of Magistrates who in all Monarchies derive their Authority from the supreme Magistrate whence the King is with equal Truth and Propriety said to be the Fountain of Justice as well as of Honour The Nature of Offices has been always declared to the People by exterior Signs and hence the Custom of investing Superior and more especially the Supreme Magistrate with extraordinary Solemnity at his Entrance upon Government which tho' with very different Forms has yet in some Form or other been practised in every civilized Nation  There can be no Doubt that the Ceremony of Anointing was borrowed from the Scriptures and the  Jews  tell us that all their Kings were anointed from  Saul  to  Hircanus  It passed from the  Jews  to other Nations and seems to have been practised here soon after the Introduction of Christianity The Monks indeed would willingly persuade us that  Alfred the Great  was the first anointed King and that he received his Unction from the Pope at  Rome  which may be true in respect to the Unction but then as  Alfred  was a Child of five Years old it is much more likely that it was the Chrism or Unction used in the Ceremony of Confirmation than the Regal Unction It appears from  Gildas  the most ancient Writer of our own Nation that is yet extant that the British Kings were anointed and this Practice was so constant that the common Phrase in the old Chronicles to express the Accession of a Prince to the Government is this that at such a Time he was anointed King We have therefore used this Ceremony as early if not earlier than any other Nation in Europe as if it was necessary might be very easily shewn  The Use of Crowns also is very ancient and in Process of Time grew to be of very different Forms The Diadem was originally of Cloth and bound about the Head like a Fillet Afterwards a Circle of Gold was in Use some times plain as was the ancient Crown of  Scotland  sometimes adorned with Spires or Rays The  Saxon  Kings used both The former being called King'sBand and the latter King'sHelm as being worn upon a Helmet In latter Times it was also worn without the Helm as well as with it as appears in the Coins of our  Saxon  Kings Other Ornaments were gradually added such as the FlowerdeLis At length the Emperor wore a Crown with Bars rising from the Sides and joining at the Top thence stiled a Crown Imperial Authors are not agreed when this was first introduced into  England  some say by  Edward  III on his being made Vicar General of the Empire by  Lewis  of  Bavaria  others by  Henry  V Be that as it will if an Imperial Crown is the Mark of Independent Sovereignty then no Doubt our Kings have a Right to wear it as well as those of  France  and  Spain  and so they have long worn it  There was not any thing in which our  Saxon  Ancestors were more curious and exact than in their Religious Ceremonies and therefore we may reasonably suppose they were particularly so in the Inauguration or as their own emphatic Term was in the hallowing their Kings This we find frequently mentioned in that authentic History stiled the  Saxon  Chronicle This Solemnity however was not confined anciently to any particular Place for amongst  other Princes  Alfred  justly surnamed  the Great  was crowned at  Winchester Ethelstan  at  Bath  where as that History tells us there were mighty Rejoicings and a great Resort of the Clergy and Nobility upon the Occasion But both in earlier and later Times than these several of our Kings were crowned at  Kingston  upon  Thames  which from thence received its Name and is therefore stiled in  Latin Regiodunum  by  Leland  who thinks that at such Times a Theatre was erected that the whole Ceremony might be more conspicuous to the People But  Edward the Confessor  was crowned at  Winchester  and it is particularly mentioned in the  Saxon  Chronicle that he received many grave Exhortations from the Archbishop in relation to the Duties of his high Office  Harold  was crowned at  Westminster  founded and scarce finished by King  Edward  and as that Chronicle says by the Appointment of his Predecessor and by the Election of the People In Respect to the Confessor's Memory the Abbey of  Westminster  became in succeeding Times the usual Place of our Monarch's Coronation more especially as the  Regalia  of that King were kept there  In our old Historians there are no Traces of the Ceremony which is not to be wondered at considering the Brevity of those Annals but in the Leidger books and other Abbey Records many Fragments are to be met with of most of the Ecclesiastical Ceremonies and amongst others of the Coronations of some of these Kings from which it plainly appears that the Forms in use after the Conquest and even the modern Forms were borrowed from these and this very probably would be still more evident if we had any  Saxon  Ceremonial compleat As it is we see plainly that the different Prayers at the Unction Crowning putting the Sword the Sceptre and the Ball into the King's Hands were taken from them and if we consider the Reverence ever paid to Antiquity more especially in Matters of this Kind it will not certainly appear strange  After what has been related it may seem a little surprising that some of our ablest Antiquaries have complained that they could meet with no settled or authentic Form of the Coronation of our Monarchs But a little Consideration will shew us that we may easily account for this in a manner very consistent with what has been  already said While our Ancestors continued Papists the Ceremonial still remained in  Latin  tho' it may be not without Additions and Alterations But after the Reformation farther Changes became necessary as we find by the very imperfect Accounts yet remaining of the Coronation of  Edward  VI in which his Oath and no doubt some other Parts were in  English  that they might be understood by the People In Process of Time several of the Prayers and Collets grew obsolete and uncouth in their Language which therefore rendered it requisite to review and retouch them in order to accommodate the Service to the Language of the Times in which it was performed When therefore Archbishop  Laud  was accused of altering the Coronation Service at the Inauguration of  Charles  I he pleaded the absolute Necessity of this he said that the Mutations and Emendations which were made in some Parts of the Service were partly to render the Sense clear and partly to make it proper in grammatical  English  which he said was done by Royal Authority in a Committee for that Purpose but that no material or essential Alterations were made and that the King's Coronation Oath particularly remained untouched and was the same with his Father's which was settled by that pious and worthy Prelate Archbishop  Whitgift  Upon the whole it may be truly affirmed that the Bulk and Substance of the Coronation Ceremony is the very same at this day as it was above a thousand Years ago and if any thing has been retrenched it has been owing to superstitious Circumstances superinduced on the ancient and venerable Form which the  Saxons  had in use and to which even after the  Norman  Conquest the Nation in general were so much attached that it was thought expedient to preserve it though afterwards when the Knowledge of this Form came to be lost with the People the Clergy might possibly introduce Expressions more favourable to their own Power and more suitable to those Notions they were desirous should prevail But these again as we have before observed were at the Reformation curtailed or taken away  As to the Pieces that are here presented to our Readers View they are such as may contribute to give them a tolerable Idea of the Coronation of a King and Queen It was in this View that the Order for the Coronation of  Charles  II was selected as being in most Respects preferable to that of his Brother which has been so pompously displayed by Mr  Sandford  whose Knowledge and Diligence we by no means would depreciate and the Assistance that he received hath enabled him to render it a truly valuable Work so that it has been and will be justly regarded as the fittest Model for future Ceremonies of that Kind King  Charles  II was not married at the Time of his Coronation and therefore we have annexed the Ceremony of the Coronation of King  James  's Queen  Mary  which will be found exactly agreeable to that of  Sandford  with the Addition of the Prayers which as well known at that Time are to shorten his Account introduced with only a Line or two and the Remainder dropt by an c  As to the Notes they relate to Persons and Things with respect to the former the Reader will find what in the Perusal of such Pieces it is very natural to desire the Names of those Prelates who assisted at those Ceremonies which as needless at that Juncture were left out when they were originally published In regard to the latter they are calculated to explain the several Parts of the  Regalia  and other Passages that seem to require Elucidation that the whole might be as plain and perspicuous as possible There is a Pleasure in reviewing the Pomp of past Triumphs in recalling to our Remembrance those great Personages who are long ago removed from our View but whom the Fame of their Actions still renders worthy of our Notice The whole stands now in such a Point of Light as that the Ceremonies of these Coronations may be as clearly and as fully conceived as if we had been present at them and as far as could be judged Care has been taken to answer every Question that a judicious and inquisitive Peruser would naturally ask in going through them the Omission of which so frequently and so greatly perplexes Relations of this Kind and renders them more apt to raise than to satisfy our Curiosity  As to the Appendix it is composed of Pieces not commonly known or easy to be found as being either involved in large Works where few would take the Pains to seek them or hid in the Closets of Antiquaries where it would have been no easy Matter to find them The Account particularly of the Manner in which our ancient  Regalia  was lost and in what it consisted has so near a Relation to the Subject and contributes so much to set it in a clearer Light that it must be allowed to deserve a Place in such a Collection as does also the Order of the solemn Cavalcade from the  Tower  to  Westminster  which our Ancestors esteemed no inconsiderable Part of the Ceremony These are likewise illustrated with such Notes as appeared necessary to explain them and it is hoped that the whole taken together will be found no unpleasing unentertaining or uninstructive Miscellany on the Subject of Coronations which being the general Topic of Conversation at present occasioned their Publication and as this has been attended with no small Degree of Haste they are submitted to the Candour of the Public  THE CEREMONY OF THE CORONATION  c  The PROCEEDINGS on the Day of his MAJESTY'S Coronation were as follows  UPON  Tuesday  the d of  April  being  St George's  Day about half an hour after seven in the Morning the KING entered into his Rich  Barge  took Water from the Privy Stairs at  Whitehall  and landed at the Parliament Stairs from whence he proceeded up to the Room behind the  Lord's House  called the  Princes Lodgings  where after he had reposed himself for a while he was arrayed in his  Royal Robes  of  Crimson Velvet  furred with  Ermine  by which time the Nobility being assembled robed themselves in the  Lord's House  and  Painted Chamber  The  Judges  also with those of the  Long Robe  the  Knights  of the  Bath  These were anciently made only on three Occasions The Coronation of a King or Queen the Creation of a Prince of Wales or of a Duke of York The Order was styled of the Holy Trinity tho' from the Ceremony of Bathing before they received the Honour of Knighthood they were commonly styled Knights of the Bath The Motto of the Order was anciently  Tria Numina juncta in uno  alluding to the Mystery of the Holy Trinity But at the Coronation of King James the First the Word  Numina  was omitted and the Motto has ever since been  Tria juncta in uno  alluding to the Union of the three Crowns On this Occasion Sixtyeight Gentlemen of the first Families in the Kingdom were created Knights of the Bath  and  Gentlemen  of the  Privy Chamber  met in the Court of  Requests  After some Space the King's  Heralds  and  Pursuivants  began to set the Proceeding in Order each of them taking his Share assigned in  Chapter  held at the  Heralds Office  the Evening before and thence directed all the beforementioned Degrees except the Nobility down into  Westminster Hall  where the rest of the Proceeding attended and from whence the March began  About half an hour after Nine the Nobility having been first called over in the Painted Chamber proceeded each according to his Rank and Dignity in their Robes and Coronets before the

 Spoon  Dr  Busby  the  Ampulla  All standing towards the lower End of the  Hall  ready to proceed they made their first Reverence together then coming to the middle of the said Hall they there made a second and thence going a little further both the  Choirs  fell off and stood on either Side through which Lane the  Pursuivants Heralds  and  Kings  passing fell likewise off on every side the Seniors still placing themselves uppermost towards the  Throne  after whom the  Dean  and  Prebends  proceeded and arrived at the  Foot  of the Stone Steps ascending to the Throne where they made another Reverence  This being done the Dean and Prebends with  Garter  principal  King  of  Arms  before them he waited their coming together ascended  the Steps and approaching near to the Table before the KING made their last Reverence  The Dean first presented the  Crown  which was by the Lord High Constable and Lord Great Chamberlain set upon the Table who afterwards took from each of the Prebends that Part of the  Regalia  which they carried and laid them also by the  Crown  which done they retired  Then the Lord Great Chamberlain presenting the  Regalia  severally to the KING his

into two  Galleries  built on either Side the upper End of the  Choir  That on the  North  Side received the Aldermen of London the Judges  Gentlemen of the Long Robe the Choir of Westminster the Gentlemen and Children of the King's Chapel excepting twelve Gentlemen four Children and one Organist who went into a Gallery raised on the  South  Side of the  upper Choir  peculiarly appointed for them And in the Gallery on the  South  Side were seated the Knights of the  Bath  and Gentlemen of the  Privy Chamber  The KING being entered the  West Door  of the  Abby Church  was received with an  Anthem  begun by the  Choir  of  Westminster  who with the  Dean  and  Prebends  had before fallen off from the  Proceeding  a little on the left Hand of the Middle Isle and stayed there to attend his coming where also a  Faldstool  and  Cushions  were laid ready for his MAJESTY to kneel at  The  Anthem  sung was the st th th and th Verses of Psalm cxxii I was glad  when they said  unto me  We will go into the  HOUSE  of the  LORD  Whither the  Tribes go up  the  Tribes of the LORD  unto the  Testimony  of  ISRAEL  to give  Thanks  unto the  Name  of the  LORD  For  there are set  Thrones  of  Judgment  the  Throne  of the  HOUSE  of  DAVID  Pray  for the  Peace  of  JERUSALEM  they shall  prosper  that  love THEE  The KING being arrived at the  Faldstool  kneeled down and used some  private Ejaculations  which being finished he thence proceeded into and through the  Choir  up to the great  Theatre  erected close to the four high Pillars standing between the  Choir  and the  Altar  upon which the  Throne  of  State  was placed being a Square raised on five Degrees at the Entrance whereof were set a  Chair Footstool  and  Cushion  covered with Cloth of  Gold  whereon he reposed himself  Immediately after the Bishop of  London  who was appointed to officiate in Part that Day for the Archbishop of  Canterbury  whose Age and Weakness rendered him incapable of performing his whole Duty at the  Coronation  having the Lord High Constable the Earl Marshal the Lord Great Chamberlain the Lord High Chancellor and the Lord Chamberlain of the Household before him went first to the  South  next to the  West  and lastly to the  North  Side of the  Theatre  and at every of the said  Sides  acquainted the  People  that he presented to Them KING CHARLES the rightful  Inheritor  of the  Crown  of this  Realm  and asked them if they were willing to do their  Homage Service  and bounden  Duty  to  him  As this was doing the KING rose up and stood by the aforesaid  Chair  turning his  Face  still to that  Side  of the  Stage  where the said Bishop stood when he spake to the  People  who signified their  Willingness  by loud  Shouts  and  Acclamations  The same  Question  was likewise put by the said Bishop to all the  Nobility  present  Immediately after this the following  Anthem  was sung by the Gentlemen of the King's Chapel  Let thy  Hand  be  strengthened  and thy  Right Hand  be  exalted  Let  Justice  and  Judgment  be the  Preparation  of thy  Seat  and  Mercy  and  Truth  go before thy  Face  In which Time a large  Carpet  was spread by a Groom and Page of the removing  Wardrobe  from the  Altar  down below the half Paces ther  and over that a Silk  Carpet  and  Cushion  laid by the  Gentleman  of the  Black Rod  and Mr  Kinnersley  whereupon the  Bishop of  London  went down from the  Stage  towards the  Altar  and having made his Reverence placed himself at the  North  Side thereof  Then the KING descended from his  Throne  and proceeded towards the  Altar  being supported by the Bishops of  Durham  and  Bath  and  Wells  with the four  Swords  the Grand Officers the Noblemen and Bishops that carried the  Regalia  before him the Dean of  Westminster  Dr John Warner  also attending Being arrived at the Steps of the  Altar  he kneeled down upon the  Cushion  there laid ready for him having first offered the  Pall  which was of Cloth of  Gold  and born by the Earl of  Sandwich  as also a  Wedge  of  Gold  of a Pound weight presented unto his  Hands  by the Lord  Cornwallis  Treasurer of his Houshold both which were received from the KING by the Bishop of  London  who laid them reverently upon the  Altar  Immediately after his MAJESTY retired to a  Chair  of  State  set on the  South  Side of the  Altar  a little below the Traverse of Crimson Taffety  After this the Bishops and Noblemen that carried the  Regalia  drew near to the  Altar  and presented every particular to the said Bishop of  London  who placed them also upon the  Altar  and having so done they retired to their Seats Whereupon the KING kneeled at a  Faldstool  set on the Right Side of the  Chair  of  State  whilst the Bishop of  London  said this  Prayer  O GOD which doth visit those that are humble and dost comfort us by thy Holy SPIRIT send down thy Grace upon this thy Servant CHARLES that by him we may feel thy Presence among us through JESUS CHRIST AMEN  This  Prayer  ended the Bishop of  Worcester  Dr George Morley  went up into the  Pulpit  placed on the  North  Side of the  Altar  opposite to the KING and began his  Sermon  the  Text  being taken out of the th Chapter of  Proverbs  and the second Verse  From the beginning of the aforesaid Offering to this Time the KING was bare but now he put on his  Cap  made of  Crimson Velvet  turned up with  Ermine  with which he sat covered all the Sermon Time  On the KING'S  right Hand  stood the Bishop of  Durham  and beyond him the Noblemen who carried the  Swords  and held them naked and erect  The  Duke  of YORK sat a little behind him on his  left Hand  next to whom stood the Bishop of  Bath  and  Wells  together with the Lord Great

Seven Hundred Years before Chrift Three Hundred and Twenty Years after this King Fergus removed it into Scotland where Anno Domini it was placed in the Abby of Scoon by King Kenneth who caused it to be inclosed in this Wooden Chair with this Distich  Ni fallat fatum some Copies read vatum Scoti hunc quocunque locatum  Invenient lapidem regnare tenentur ibidem  If Truth our Sages speak nor Fables

Abby of Westminster and dedicated it to St Edward the Confessor since which Time our Kings have been always seated in it at their Coronation The Prophecy is supposed to have been fulfilled in the Person of James the Sixth of Scotland and First of England from whom his present Majesty King George the Third is descended in a direct line  See the  Frontispiece A  covered all over with Cloth of  Gold  was placed upon the  North  Side of the  Altar  a little lower than that belonging to the Archbishop but something nearer the Middle of the Isle and between the  King's Chair  of  State  and the  Pulpit  Near the  Pulpit  stood the  Master  of the  Jewel House  and the  Lord Mayor  of  London  The Nobility not formerly named who were seated upon Forms round about the inside of the  Stage  when Sermon began drew near to that Side thereof which faced the High  Altar  and stood there  On the Corners of the  Stage  near the High  Altar  adjoining to the two uppermost Pillars were Places railed in for the Provincial Kings Heralds and Pursuivants  The Serjeants at Arms being sixteen in Number stood with their Maces on their Shoulders within the Rails on either Side the Entrance of the  Stage  from the  Choir  Over the Door at the  West  End of the  Choir  stood the Drums and Trumpets  Sermon  being ended the KING uncovered his  Head  and immediately the Bishop of  London  arose from his Seat drew near unto the KING'S  Chair  of  State  and asked him his  Willingness  to take the  Oath  usually taken by his  Predecessors  The KING assenting thereunto  The Bishop then administred the following  Questions  which the KING answered severally  Bishop  SIR Will you grant and keep and by your Oath confirm to the People of  England  the Laws and Customs to them granted by the Kings of  England  your lawful and Religious Predecessors and namely the Laws Customs and Franchises granted to the Clergy by the glorious King  St Edward  your Predecessor according to the Laws of GOD the true Profession of the Gospel established in this Kingdom agreeable to the Prerogative of the Kings thereof and the ancient Customs of this Realm  King  I grant and promise to keep them  Bishop  Will

defend and uphold them to the Honour of GOD so much as in you lieth  King  I grant and promise so to do  Then the Bishop of  Rochester  read the Bishops  Petition  to the KING as follows  Our LORD and KING We beseech you to pardon us and to grant and to preserve unto us and to the Churches committed to our Charge all Canonical Privileges and due Law and Justice and that you would protect and defend us as every good King in his Kingdom ought to be Protector and Defender of the Bishops and the Churches under their Government  To which the  King  answered in the following Words  With a willing and devout Heart I promise and grant my Pardon and that I will preserve and maintain to you and the Churches committed to your Charge all Canonical Privileges and due Law and Justice and that I will be your Protector and Defender to my Power by the Assistance of God as every good King in his Kingdom in Right ought to protect and defend the Bishops and Churches under their Government  Then the KING assisted by the Bishops of  Durham  and  Bath  and  Wells  was led from his  Chair  to the  Altar  the  Sword  of  State  being born before  him  and the Lord Great Chamberlain attending where he took the following  Oath  in Sight of all present laying his  Hand  upon the BIBLE  The things which I have here promised I shall perform and keep so help me GOD and the Contents of this Book  The KING was then led back in like Manner to his  Chair  of  State  and immediately the Bishop of  London  and the  Choir  begun the  Hymn  VENI CREATOR SPIRITUS  And a little before the ending thereof the  Faldstool  was set again at the  King's Right Hand  whereat as soon as the  Hymn  was finished he kneeled the Bishop of  London  standing before him and saying the following  Prayer  We beseech Thee O LORD Holy Father Almighty and Everlasting GOD for this thy Servant CHARLES that as at first thou didst bring him into the World by thy Divine Providence and through the Flower of his Age has preserved him unto this present Day so thou wouldst evermore enrich him with thy Bounty and fill him with Grace and Truth and daily increase in him all Goodness in the Sight of GOD and Man that being placed in the Throne of Supreme Government assisted by thy heavenly Grace and by thy Mercy defended from all his Enemies He may govern the People committed to his Charge in Wealth Peace and Godliness through JESUS CHRIST our LORD AMEN  The  Prayer  ended the Bishop of  London  went to the  North  Side of the  Altar  the KING still kneeling and forthwith the Bishops of  Peterborough  Dr Benjamin Laney  and  Gloucester  Dr William Nicholson  went and kneeled on the upper  Haut Pace  of the  Altar  where they began the  Litany  the  Choirs  singing the  Responses  the  Dean  of  Westminster  kneeling all the while at the  King's left Hand  After the  Litany  the Bishop of  London  said the three following  Prayers  at the  North  Side of the  Altar  Almighty and Everlasting GOD Creator of all Things King of Kings and Lord of Lords Give Ear we beseech Thee unto our humble Prayers and multiply thy Blessings upon this thy Servant CHARLES whom in thy Name with lowly Devotion we consecrate our KING Grant that by thy Inspiration he may govern with the Mildness of SOLOMON and enjoy a peaceable Kingdom Grant that he may serve Thee with Fear and fight  for Thee with Constancy Defend him by thy mighty Arm compass him with thy Protection and enable him to overcome all his Enemies Honour him before all the Kings of the Earth Let him rule over Countries and let Nations how down before him Establish his Throne with Judgment and Equity Let Justice flourish in his Days and grant that he supported by the due Obedience and hearty Love of his People may sit on the Throne of his Fathers many Years and after this transitory Life may reign with  Thee  in thine everlasting Kingdom through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord  and  Saviour Amen  GOD the unspeakable Author of the World Creator of Men Governor of Empires and Establisher of all Kingdoms who out of the Loins of our Father  Abraham  didst chuse a  King  that became the  Saviour  of all Kings and Nations of the Earth Bless we beseech Thee thy faithful Servant and our dread Sovereign Lord  King Charles  with the richest Blessings of thy Grace Establish him in the Throne of his Kingdom by thy mighty Aid and Protection Visit him as thou didst  Moses  in the Bush  Joshua  in the Battle  Gideon  in the Field and  Samuel  in the Temple Let the Dew of thine abundant Mercies fall upon his Head and give him the Blessing of  David  and  Solomon  Be unto him an Helmet of Salvation against the Face of his Enemies and a strong Tower of Defence in the Time of Adversity Let his Reign be prosperous and his Days many Let Peace and Love and Holiness let Justice and Truth and all Christian Virtues flourish in his Time Let his People serve him with Honour and Obedience And let him so duly serve thee here on Earth that he may hereafter everlastingly reign with  Thee  in Heaven through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord Amen  GOD which providest for thy People by thy Power and rulest over them in Love grant unto this thy Servant  Charles  the Spirit of Wisdom and Government that being devoted unto  Thee  he may so wisely govern his Kingdom that in his Time the Church may be in Safety and Christian Devotion continue in Peace that so persevering to the End in good Works he may by thy Mercy come unto thine Everlasting Kingdom through thy Son  Jesus Christ  our  Lord  who liveth and reigneth with Thee World without End  Amen  A little before the last  Prayer  was ended the Archbishop of  Canterbury  came out at the  North  Door of  St Edward's  Chapel vested in a rich  Cope  and at the Conclusion thereof he began the  Versicle  Lift up your Hearts  Resp  We lift them up to the  Lord  Archbishop  Let us give Thanks unto the  Lord  our  God  Resp  It is meet and right so to do  Archbishop  It is very meet and right and our bounden Duty that we should at all Times and in all Places give Thanks unto thee O  Lord  Holy Father Almighty and everlasting GOD the Strength of thy Chosen and the Exalter of the Humble which in the beginning by the pouring out of the Flood didst chasten the Sins of the World and by a Dove conveying an Olive Branch didst give a Token of Reconcilement unto the Earth and again didst consecrate thy Servant  Aaron  a Priest by the anointing of Oil and afterwards by the Effusion of this Oil didst make Priests and Kings and Prophets to govern thy People  Israel  and by the Voice of the Prophet  David  didst foretel that the Countenance of thy Church should be made chearful with Oil We beseech Thee Almighty Father that thou wilt vouchsafe to bless and sanctify this thy Servant  Charles  that he may minister Peace unto his People  imitate  Aaron in thy Service and That he may attain the Perfection of Government in Counsel and Judgment through  Christ Jesus  our  Lord  Amen  This finished the KING arose from the  Faldstool  and went to the  Altar  supported by the aforesaid Bishops of  Durham  and  Bath  and  Wells  where he was disrobed by the Lord Great Chamberlain of his  Royal Robes  which were immediately carried thence into the  Traverse  erected in  St Edward  's Chapel  While this was doing the  Chair  that was before placed at the Entrance of the Stage was removed and set on the  North  Side of the  Altar  between it and  St Edward's Chair  whereunto the KING came sat down and was anointed by the said Archbishop while the  Dean  of  Westminster  held the AMPULLA  The Ampulla is in the Form of an Eagle with Wings expanded standing on a Pedestal all of pure Gold weighing about ten Ounces The Eagle being hollow unscrews in the Middle of the Neck for the more easy putting in the Oil which when the King is anointed is poured through the Beak The French have an Ampulla which is said to have been brought from Heaven by a white Dove and which is kept in the Abby of S Remi from whence it is brought in great Ceremony when the most Christian King is crowned at Rheims In regard to this our Popish Ancestors were not behind for the Reader may find in Thomas Walsingham that the Blessed Virgin gave to Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury being then in Exile a Holy Eagle full of Oil in a Stone Vessel which he deposited in a Monastery at Poitiers There in the Reign of Edward III Henry I Duke of Lancaster received it from a holy Man who found it by a second Revelation The Duke gave it to the Black Prince who placed it in a strong Chest in the Tower where his Son Richard the Second searching for his Father's Jewels met with it and pressed the Archbishop of Canterbury to anoint him therewith but the Archbishop told him he had been once anointed and that this Royal Unction could not be repeated The King carried it over to Ireland and at his Return from thence gave it to the Archbishop who therewith anointed Henry the Fourth In  Sandford's History of the Coronation of James the Second  we are told the Oil for that Monarch's Coronation was prepared by his Order by James St Amand Esq Apothecary to that Prince and which was solemnly consecrated the Morning of the Coronation by the Dean of Westminster assisted by the Prebendaries It was so exceeding rich and fragrant and so highly approved of by the King and Queen that he had two hundred Pounds paid him for it by the Treasurer of the Household in Consequence of a Warrant from the Lord Chamberlain  and poured the  Oil  into the  Spoon  first in the  Palm  of  both  his  Hands  in manner of a  Cross  the Archbishop as he anointed  him  pronouncing these Words  Let these Hands be anointed with Holy Oil as Kings and Prophets have been anointed and as  Samuel  did anoint  David  to be King that thou mayest be blessed and established a King in this Kingdom over the People whom the  Lord  thy  God  hath given Thee to rule and govern Which He vouchsafe to grant who with the Father and the Holy Ghost three in Person and one in Unity reigns in Glory everlasting  Amen  After which the  Choir  sung this  Anthem  Sadoc  the Priest and  Nathan  the Prophet anointed  Solomon  King and all the People rejoiced and said GOD SAVE THE KING  At the End of which  Anthem  the Archbishop said this  Prayer  It is very remarkable that these Prayers and even the Anthem made a Part of the Ceremony used in the Coronation of our  Saxon  Kings near a thousand Years ago as appears by a Fragment of their Pontifical still remaining    Look down Almighty GOD with thy favourable Countenance upon this thy Servant and dread Sovereign  King Charles  and as thou didst bless  Abraham Isaac  and  Jacob  so vouchsafe we beseech Thee to water Him plentifully with the Blessings of thy Grace Give unto Him of the Dew of Heaven and of the Fatness of the Earth abundance of Corn Wine and Oil with Plenty of Fruits and other good Things Grant him long to reign and that in his Time there may be Health and Peace in this Kingdom Grant O  Lord  that he may be a mighty Protector of this Nation a bountiful Comforter of Churches the most valiant of Monarchs terrible to Rebels amiable to his Nobles and all his faithful Subjects Make his Royal Court to shine in Princely Dignity as a most clear Lightning far and wide in the Eyes of all Men Finally let him be blessed with Children that may reign as Kings after Him and rule this Kingdom by Succession of all Ages and after the glorious and happy Days of this present Life give him of thy Mercy an everlasting Kingdom with thee in Heaven through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord Amen  And then proceeded with his anointing the KING'S  Breast  between his  Shoulders  on  both  his  Shoulders  the  Bowings  of his  Arms  and on the  Crown  of his  Head  in manner aforesaid  Which being done the  Anointing  was dried up with fine  Linen  and the  Loops  of his  Shirt  closed up by the Dean of  Westminster  and then the Archbishop said these two  Prayers  GOD the  Son  of GOD  Christ Jesus  our  Lord  who is anointed of his Father with the Oil of Gladness above his Fellows pour down upon thy Head the Blessing of the  Holy Ghost  and make it enter into thy Heart so that thou mayest receive invisible Grace and having justly governed thy temporal Kingdom thou mayest reign with him eternally who being without Sin doth live in Glory with GOD the  Father  and the  Holy Ghost  for ever and ever  GOD which art the Glory of the Righteous and the Saviour of Sinners who hath sent thy Son to redeem Mankind with his Precious Blood who bringest Wars to an End and defendest those that trust in Thee upon whose good Will and Pleasure doth depend the Strength of all Kingdoms we humbly pray in this Royal Seat to bless this thy Servant who putteth his Confidence in thy Mercy Vouchsafe in thy Favour to be present with him that he which desireth to be defended by thy Protection may be stronger than his Enemies Crown him with the Crown of Justice and Piety that with all his Heart and all his Mind he may trust in thee serve thee defend and advance thy Holy Church and govern the People committed to his Charge in Justice and Equity Kindle O  Lord  his Heart with the Love of thy Grace by the inward Anointing wherewith thou hast anointed Priests Kings and Prophets that be loving Justice and leading his People by the Ways of Righteousness after the glorious Course of this Life which thou hast appointed may come to Eternal Joy through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord Amen  During the time of  Unction  a rich  Pall  os  Cloth  of  Gold  brought from the great Wardrobe by Mr  Rumball  was held over the  King's Head  by the Dukes of  Buckingham  and  Albemarle  the Earls of  Berks  and  Sandwich  as  Knights  of the most noble  Order  of the  Garter  After these  Prayers  the Lord Great Chamberlain delivered the  Coif  to the Archbishop who put it on the  King's Head  and immediately after the Dean of Westminster put the  Colobium Sindonis  or  Surplice  This is a Garment of white Cambrick without Sleeves laced about the Neck Arm  down the Breast upon the Slits on the Sides and round the Bottom with very fine Lace  upon the  King  Whereupon the Archbishop the  King  thus clothed said this short  Prayer  O GOD the King of Kings and Lord of Lords by whom Kings reign and Princes decree Justice vouchsafe we beseech thee in thy favour to bless this Kingly Ornament and grant that thy Servant  Charles  our  King  who shall wear it may shine in thy Sight with the Ornament of a good Life and Holy Actions and after this Life ended he may for ever enjoy that Life and Glory which hath no End through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord  Amen  This said the Dean of Westminster having likewise fetched the Tissue  Hose  and  Sandals  from the  Altar  he arrayed the KING therewith as also  with the  Super Tunica  This  coat is close with plain Sleeves of a very thick and rich Cloth of Gold Tissue The Length behind is a Yard Quarter and half and before a Yard and Quarter below which the Colobium reaches about a Nail To this Surcoat belongs a Belt of the same Cloth of Gold Tissue with a Gold Buckle to which the King's Sword is fastened with which he is girded  or Close  Pall  of Cloth Cloth of  Gold  and girded the same about  him  But the  Taffety  and  Shirt  was not used  After all the Dean took the  Spurs  from off the  Altar  and delivered them to the Lord Great Chamberlain who touched the KING'S  Heels  therewith and forthwith sent them back to the  Altar  Then the Archbishop received the  Sword  of  State  in the  Scabbard  from the Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold and laid it upon the  Altar  saying this  Prayer  Hear our Prayers we beseech Thee O  Lord  and vouchsafe by thy Right Hand of Majesty to bless and sanctify this Sword wherewith this thy Servant  Charles  defireth to be girt that it may be a Defence and Protection of Churches Widows and Orphans and all thy Servants and a Terror to all those that lie in wait to do mischief through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord Amen  This  Prayer  finished the Archbishop and Bishops assisting delivered the  Sword  back to the KING saying  Accipe Gladium per Manus Episcoporum  This seems from the Fragment beforementioned to have been a Part of the old Saxon Ceremonial    Whereupon the Lord Great Chamberlain  girt  it about the KING and the Archbishop said  Receive this  Kingly Sword  which is hallowed for the Defence of the  Holy Church  and delivered unto Thee by the Hands of the Bishops though unworthy yet consecrated by the Authority of the  Holy Apostles  and remember of whom the  Psalmist  did Prophesy saying  Gird thyself with thy Sword upon thy Thigh O thou most mighty  and with this Sword exercise thou the force of Equity and mightily destroy the growth of Iniquity Protect the Holy Church of GOD and his faithful People Defend and help Widows and Orphans Restore things gone to Decay and maintain those that are restored that doing thus thou mayest be  glorious  in the triumph of  Virtue  and excellent in the Ornament of  Justice  and  Reign  for ever with the  Saviour  of the  World  whose  Image  you bear who with the  Father  and the  Holy Ghost  liveth and reigneth World without End  After this the Dean of  Westminster  took the  Armill  This is made of the same Cloth of Tissue as the Surcoat lined with Crimson Sarsenet in Length it is about an Ell and in Breadth three Inches with two double Ribbands at each End for the more convenient tying it above and below the Elbows  made of Cloth of  Tissue  and put it about the KING'S  Neck  and  tied  it to the  Bowings  of his  Arms  the Archbishop standing before the KING with the Bishop of  London  on his Right Hand and saying  Receive the Armill of Sincerity and Wisdom as a Token of GOD'S embracing whereby all thy Works may be defended against thine Enemies both bodily and ghostly through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord  Next the  Mantle  This is likewise stiled Dalmatica and answers to the Imperial Cloak being of Gold and Purple brocaded Tissue adorned with large Flowers of Gold frosted  or open  Pall  being made of Cloth of  Gold  and lined with  red Taffety  was put upon  him  by the said Dean the Archbishop likewise using the Words of Signification  viz  Receive this Pall which is formed with four Corners to let thee understand that the four Corners of the World are subject to the Power of GOD and that no Man can happily reign upon Earth who hath not received his Authority from Heaven  In the next Place the Archbishop took  St Edward's Crown  and  blessed it  saying  This also appears to have been taken from the old Saxon Pontifical    GOD the Crown of the Faithful who on the Heads of thy Saints placeth Crowns of Glory bless and sanctify this  Crown  that as the same is adorned with divers precious Stones so this thy Servant wearing it may be replenished of thy Grace with the manifold Gifts of all precious Virtues through the King eternal thy Son our  Lord Amen  In the mean Time  St Edward's Chair  was removed into the Middle of the Isle and set right over against the  Altar  whither the KING went and  sat  down in it and then the Archbishop brought  St Edward's Crown  from the  Altar  and put it upon his  Head  Whereupon all the  People  with  loud  and  repeated Shouts  cried GOD SAVE THE KING And by a  Signal  then  given  the great  Ordinance  from the  Tower  were also discharged  At the  ceasing  of these  Acclamations  the Archbishop went on saying  GOD crown thee with a Crown of Glory and Righteousness with the Honour and Virtue of Fortitude that by a right Faith and manifold Fruits of good Works thou mayest obtain the Crown of an everlasting Kingdom by the Gift of him whose Kingdom endureth for ever  Amen  Adding thereunto this  Prayer  O GOD of Eternity the Commander of all Powers the Vanquisher of all Enemies Bless this thy Servant who  At which Words the King bowed his Head  boweth his Head unto thy Majesty preserve him in Health and prosperous Felicity be present with him whensoever he calleth upon thee give him we beseeth Thee the Riches of thy Grace fill his Soul with Goodness and crown him with thy Mercy and let him always in godly Devotion wait upon Thee through thy Son our  Lord Jesus Christ Amen  After the  Prayer  the Archbishop read the  Conforture  Be strong and of a good Courage and observe the Commandments of the Lord to walk in his Ways and keep his Ceremonies Precepts Testimonies and Judgments and Almighty GOD prosper and strengthen thee whither soever thou goest The Lord is my Ruler therefore I shall want nothing  In the mean Time the  Choir  sung this  Anthem  The KING shall  rejoice  in thy  Strength  O LORD  exceeding glad  shall  he be  of thy  Salvation  for  Thou  hast  granted him  his  Heart's Desire  and hast not  denied him  the  Request  of his  Lips  for  Thou  hast  prevented him  with  Blessings  of  Goodness  and hast  set a Crown  of pure  Gold  upon his  Head  Upon this the  Dukes Marquisses Earls  and  Viscounts  put on their  Coronets  the  Barons  their  Caps  In the Month of August following the King was graciously pleased to grant that in all future Coronations and on other public Occasions the Barons of this Realm should use a Crimson Silken Cap with a Circle of Gold having fix Pearls disposed at equal Distances thereon and King James the Second in the First Year of his Reign granted them further to wear Robes of Velvet instead of those of Cloth which they had worn hitherto  and divers of them came and stood about the KING who still  sat  in  St Edward's Chair  Garter  and the other  Kings  at  Arms  put on their  Crowns  likewise  Then the Master of the Jewel House delivered to the Archbishop the  Ring  This Coronation Ring is of Gold with a large Table Ruby Violet wherein a Cross of St George is curiously enchased  who consecrated it after this manner saying  Bless O  Lord  and sanctify this Ring that thy Servant wearing it may be sealed with the Ring of Faith and by the Power of the Highest be preserved from Sin and let all the Blessings which are found in Holy Scripture plentifully descend upon him that whatsoever he shall sanctify may be holy and whatsoever he blesseth may be blessed  Amen  After which he  put  it upon the  fourth Finger  of the  King's Right Hand  and said  Receive this Ring of kingly Dignity and by it the Seal of Catholic Faith that as this Day thou art consecrated the Head and Prince of this Kingdom and People so thou mayest preserve as the Author and Establisher of Christianity the Christian Faith that being rich in Faith and happy in good Works thou mayest reign with him that is King of Kings to whom be Honour and Glory for ever and ever  Amen  And then began this  Prayer  O GOD to whom belongeth all Power and Dignity give unto thy Servant  Charles  the Fruit of his Dignity wherein grant he may long continue and fear Thee always and always labour to please Thee through  Jesus Christ  our  Lord Amen  When this  Prayer  was finished the  Linen Gloves  were delivered to the KING by the Lord Great Chamberlain who going to the  Altar ungirt  his  Sword  and  offered  it at the  Altar  in the  Scabbard  which being  redeemed  by the Lord Chamberlain of the Household was  drawn out  of the  Scabbard  and  carried naked  by  him  all the following  Part  of the  Solemnity  Then the Archbishop took the  Scepter  with the  Cross  from  off  the  Altar  and delivered it into the KING'S  Right Hand  saying  Receive this Scepter the Sign of Kingly Power the Rod of Kingdoms the Rod of Virtue that thou govern thyself aright and defend the Holy Church and Christian People committed by GOD unto thy Charge punish the Wicked and protect the Just and lead them in the Ways of Righteousness that from this temporal Kingdom thou mayest be advanced to an eternal Kingdom by his Goodness whose Kingdom is everlasting  Amen  Whilst this was  pronounced  by the Archbishop Mr  Henry Howard delivered  to the KING a rich  Glove  which he  put  on his  right Hand  and then  received  the  Scepter  And after that the Archbishop said this  Prayer  O LORD the Fountain of all good Things and the Author of all good Proceedings grant we beseech Thee to this thy Servant CHARLES that he may order aright the Dignity which he hath obtained Vouchsafe to confirm the Honour which thou hast given him Honour him before all Kings and enrich him with thy Benediction establish him in the Throne of his Realm visit him with increase of Children Let Justice spring up in his Days and with all Felicity let him reign in thine everlasting Kingdom  Amen  During which Time the said Mr  Howard  performed the Service  supporting  the  King's right Arm  according as it was adjudged him  Court of Claims by Virtue of holding the Manor of  Works  p  in  County of  Nottingham  Next of all the Archbishop took the  Scepter  with the  Dove  and  it into the  King's Hand  also saying  Receive the Rod of Virtue and Equity learn to make Account of the  and to terrify the Wicked shew the Way to those that go astray offer  Hand to those that fall repress the Proud lift up the lowly that our Lord JESUS CHRIST may open to thee the Doors who saith of himself  I am  Door by me if any Man enter he shall be safe  And let him be  Help who is the Stay of DAVID and the SCEPTER of the HOUSE of ISRAEL who openeth and no Man shutteth who bringeth the Captive out  Prison where he sat in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death That  all Things thou mayest follow him of whom the Prophet DAVID saith  Thy Seat O GOD endureth for ever the Scepter of thy Kingdom is a righ  Scepter Thou hast loved Righteousness and hated Iniquity wherefore  GOD even thy GOD hath anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness above thy Fellows  even JESUS CHRIST our LORD AMEN  After which the KING kneeled holding  both  the  Scepters  in his  Hands  whilst the Archbishop thus  blessed him  The  Lord  bless and keep thee and as he hath made thee King over his People so may be still prosper thee in this World and make thee Partaker of his Eternal Felicity in the World to come  Amen  Then the KING arose and set himself again in  St Edward's Chair  whilst the Archbishop and Bishops present one after another  kneeled before him  and were  kissed by him  In the mean Time the  King's Chair  of  State  wherein he was anointed was set above the  upper Steps  at the  Entrance  upon the  Theatre  whither the KING went as soon as he had performed the Ceremony of kissing the Bishops having now four Swords born naked before him the Archbishop Bishops and great Officers attending At his Arrival there the Archbishop said this  Prayer  the KING  kneeling  Grant O LORD that the Clergy and People gathered together by thy Ordinance for this Service of the King may by the most gracious Assistance of thy Goodness and the vigilant Care of thy Servant our King be continually governed and preserved in all Happiness and that they obeying thy holy Will may be freed from all Adversities and enjoying the Riches of thy Grace may with fervent Love walk in the Ways of thy Commandments that in this Life being made Partakers of thy Peace they may be Citizens of thy Kingdom in the Life to come through JESUS CHRIST our LORD AMEN  Then the KING arose and reposed himself in his  Chair  whilst both the  Choirs  sung TE DEUM  When  Te Deum  was ended the KING  ascended  his  Throne  placed in the Middle of the  Theatre  the Swords and great Officers standing on either Side as also the Bishops some in Copes others in Rochets the Archbishop then saying  Stand and hold fast from henceforth that Place of Royal Dignity whereof thou art the lawful and undoubted Heir by Succession from thy Forefathers being now delivered unto thee by the Authority of Almighty GOD by the Hands of us and all the Bishops and Servants of GOD and as thou seest the Clergy approach nearer unto the Altar so remember that in Places suitable thou give them greater Honour that the Mediator of God and Man may establish thee in this Kingly Throne to be the Mediator between the Clergy and Laity that thou mayest reign for ever with JESUS CHRIST the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who with the Father and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth World without End AMEN  After this the Bishops and Nobility did their  Homage  to the KING in manner following  And first the Archbishop of  Canterbury kneeled down  before the  King's Knees  and said  I  William  Dr William Juxon who deceased October  Archbishop of  Canterbury  shall be faithful and true and Faith and Truth bear unto you our Sovereign Lord and your Heirs Kings of  England  and shall do and truly acknowledge the Service of the Land which I claim to hold of You in the Right of the Church So help me GOD  Which said he  kissed  the  King's left Cheek  The  like  did all the  other Bishops  that were present  Then came up the  Duke  of YORK with  Garter  Principal  King  of  Arms  before him and his  Train  born by two Gentlemen who being arrived at the  Throne kneeled  down before the KING put off his  Coronet  and did his  Homage  At which the  Drums  beat  Trumpets  sounded and all the  People  shouted  The  like  did the Dukes of  Buckingham  and  Albemarle  for  themselves  and the  rest  of the  Dukes  So also did the Marquisses of  Worcester  and  Dorchester  Next the Earl of  Oxford  did  Homage  after the same manner for himself and all the  rest  of the  Earls  who attended upon him to  signify  their  Consent  After him Viscount  Hereford  did the like for himself and the  rest  of the  Viscounts  and then the  Drums  beat and  Trumpets  sounded  Lastly Baron  Audley  in like manner did  Homage  for himself and all the  Barons  who also accompanied him to the  Throne  to  signify  their  Consent  which being finished  Drums Trumpets  and  Shouts  followed  The Words of Homage uttered by such of the Nobility as kneeled down were  I  M M  do become your Liege Man of Life and Limb and of earthly Worship and of Faith and Truth I shall bear unto you to live and die against all manner of Folks So help me GOD  Afterwards the  Duke  of YORK and all the Nobility  singly ascended  the  Throne  and  touched  the  King's Crown  promising by that  Ceremony  to be ever ready to  support it  with all their  Power  During the Performance of this  solemn Ceremony  the Lord High Chancellor went to the  South West  and  North  Sides of the  Stage  and  proclaimed  to the  People  the  King's  GENERAL PARDON being attended by  Garter  to the  South Side  and by a  Gentleman Usher  and two  Heralds  to the  other  two Sides  And at these  three Sides  at the same Time did the Lord  Cornwallis  Treasurer of his Majesty's Household fling abroad the  Medals  both of  Gold  and  Silver  prepared for the  Coronation  as a Princely  Donation  or  Largess  among the  People  The KING being thus enthronized the  Gentlemen  of his  Chapel  began this  Anthem  Behold O LORD our  Defender  and  look upon  the  Face  of  thine anointed  The LORD GOD is a  Light  and  Defence  The LORD will give  Grace  and  Glory  and  no good Thing  will be  withold from them  that live a  Godly Life  O LORD GOD of  Hosts  Blessed is the  Man  who putteth his  Trust  in  thee  In the mean Time the KING took off his  Crown  and delivered it to the Lord High Chamberlain to hold the  Scepter  with the  Cross  to Mr  Henry Howard  and  that  with the  Dove  to the Duke of  Albemarle  The  Epistle  taken out of the First Epistle of  St Peter  the Second  Chapter  and beginning at the Eleventh  Verse  was read by the Bishop of  Chichester  Dr Henry King    The  Gospel  being Part of the Twentysecond  Chapter  of  St Matthew  beginning at the th  Verse  by the Bishop of  Ely  Dr Matthew Wren  After which the  Nicene Creed  was begun by the Bishop of  London  and sung by the Gentlemen of the Chapel with  Verse  and  Chorus  the Violins and other Music playing alternately  All which Time the KING stood by his  Throne  But towards the End of the Creed he again took his Crown from the Lord Great Chamberlain and put it on his Head as also the Scepter with the Cross from Mr  Howard  and that with the Dove from the Duke of  Albemarle  and prepared for his Descent from his Throne towards the  Altar  to  receive  the  Communion  And as soon as the singing of the  Creed  was fully ended the KING descended with the  Crown  on his  Head  and  Scepters  in both  Hands  the Bishops of  Durham  and  Bath  and  Wells  supporting him with the four Swords naked before and all the great Officers of State attending  During the Time of this  Proceeding  the  Choir  sung  Let my  Prayer  come up unto thy  Presence  as the  Incense  and the lifting up of my  Hands  be as an  Evening Sacrifice  Here the Archbishop of  Canterbury  retired from the Ceremonies into  St Edward's  Chapel and thence went home leaving the Remainder of his Duty to be performed by the Bishop of  London  At the KING'S Approach to the  Altar  the Bishop of  Ely  delivered unto him  Bread  and  Wine  which he there  offered  and then returned to the  Faldstool  on the  South  Side of the  Altar  near his  Chair  of  State  before which he  kneeled  down and laid his  Crown  upon the  Cushion  before him towards his  right Hand  and the  Scepter  with the  Dove  on his  left  and  gave again to Mr  Howard  the  Scepter  with the  Cross  who held it  kneeling  on the  King's right Hand  The Great Officers and the Noblemen with the four Swords naked and erect standing about him  Then the Bishop of  London  said this  Prayer  Bless O LORD we beseech Thee these thy Gifts and sanctify them unto this holy Use that by them we may be made Partakers of the Body and Blood of thy only begotten Son JESUS CHRIST And grant that thy Servant CHARLES our dread Sovereign may be fed thereof unto everlasting Life of Soul and Body and enabled thereby to discharge the Duty of his high Place and Office whereunto thou hast called him of thy great Goodness Grant this O LORD for JESUS CHRIST'S sake our only Mediator and Advocate AMEN  At the End of which the Lord  Cornwallis  Treasurer of the Houshold presented the KING with another  Wedge  of  Gold  which goeth under the  Name  of the  Mark  of  Gold  This the KING  offered  into the  Bason kneeling  still at his  Faldstool  whilst the Bishop of  London  said the following  Prayer  Almighty GOD give thee of the Dew of Heaven and of the Fat of the Earth and abundance of Corn and Wine Let the Nations serve thee and the Tribes worship thee and let him be blessed that blesseth thee and GOD shall be thy Helper Almighty GOD bless you with the Blessing of Heaven above in the Mountains and Hills and with the Blessings of the Earth beneath with the Blessings of Corn and Wine and Fruit and let the Blessings of the Fathers  Abraham Isaac  and  Jacob  be established upon thee through JESUS CHRIST our  Lord Amen  And next  pronounced  this  Blessing  Bless O LORD the virtuous Carriage of this KING and accept the Work of his Hands replenish his Realm with the Blessings of Heaven of the Dew of the Water and of the Deeps Let the Influence of the Sun and Moon drop down Fatness upon the high Mountains and the Clouds rain Plenty on the Vallies that the Earth may abound with all Things Let the Blessings of him that appeared in the Bush descend upon his Head and the Fulness of his Blessings fall on his Children and Posterity Let his Feet be dipped in Oil and his Horn exalted as the Horn of an Unicorn with which he may scatter his Enemies from off the Face of the Earth The Lord that sitteth in Heaven be his Defender for ever and ever through JESUS CHRIST our LORD AMEN  Then the Bishop  proceeded  to the  Consecration  of the  Sacrament  Which being  finished  he  first  of all  received  next the  Dean  of  Westminster  then the  Bishop  of  Bath  and  Wells  and lastly the  Bishop  of  Durham  The four Prelates having communicated  Preparation  was made for the  King's receiving  who  kneeled  all this while before the  Faldstool  The  Towel  being brought and  presented  to the Bishops of  Hereford  Dr Nicholas Monk  and  Carlisle  Dr Brian Walton  they held it before the KING while he  received  The Bishop of  London  gave the KING the  Bread  and the Dean of  Westminster  the  Cup  As soon as the KING had  received  this  Anthem  was begun by the upper  Choir  "O hearken  unto the  Voice  of my  Calling  my  King  and my  God  My Voice  shalt  thou hear  in the  Morning O LORD  in the  Morning  will I direct  my Prayer  unto  Thee  For thou LORD wilt  bless  the  Righteous  with  Favour  wilt  thou compass him  as with a  Shield  "  In the mean while the KING returned to his  Throne  upon the  Theatre  with the  Crown  on his Head and the  Scepters  in his Hands  When he came thither he put off his  Crown  and delivered it to the Lord Great Chamberlain the  Scepter  with the  Cross  to Mr  Howard  and that with the  Dove  to the Duke of  Albemarle  And then the Bishop of  London  went on with the  Communion  which being finished the KING attended as before  descended  from his  Throne crowned  with both the  Scepters  in his Hand  The rest of the  Regalia  which lay all this while on the Altar being delivered to the Noblemen that brought them in the  Proceeding  to the Church were carried before him and thence the KING proceeded into  St Edward's  Chapel the Organs playing all the while  Where being arrived he took off  St Edward's Crown  and delivered it to the Bishop of  London  who immediately laid it upon  St Edward's Altar  all the rest of the  Regalia  were given into the Hands of the Dean of  Westminster  and laid there also  Afterwards the KING entered into the  Traverse  erected in the middle of the Wall on the back side of the  High Altar  and there retired whilst he was disrobed of  St Edward's Robes  by Mr  Seymour  and Mr  Ashburnham  Grooms of the Bedchamber on the behalf of the Lord Great Chamberlain which were laid on  St Edward's Altar  by the Bishop of  Durham  and afterwards delivered to the Dean of  Westminster  to lay up with the  Regalia  After this the KING was arrayed in his  Purple Robes  and then came near to  St Edward's Altar  where the Bishop of  London  stood ready with the  Imperial Crown  in his Hands and set it upon the  King's Head  upon which the KING took the  Scepter  with the  Cross  in his  right Hand  and the  Globe  in his  left  and immediately the  Proceeding  began thence into  Westminster  Hall  the same Way that he came and attended after the same Manner saving that the Noblemen and Bishops which brought the  Regalia  to the  Abby Church  went not now immediately before the KING as they did then but were ranked in Places according to their Degrees and Consecrations all the Noblemen with their Coronets and Caps on their Heads The Kings of Arms marched likewise with their Crowns on  The  Proceeding  being entered into  Westminster Hall  the Nobility and others who had Tables assigned them went and placed themselves thereat but the KING attended by the Great Officers withdrew into the inner Court of Wards for half an Hour In the mean Time all the Tables in the Hall were served before the  King's  Service came up and were placed in this Manner  On the right Hand of the King's Throne below in the Hall were set two Tables one beneath the other At the upper End of the first next the State which had two Side Tables to serve it sat the Bishops and below them the Judges with the rest of the Long Robe  At the second Table which had two Side Board Tables likewise to serve it sat the Masters in Chancery and the Six Clerks  And here at this Table were the Barons of the Cinque Ports obliged to sit through a Disturbance that happened with which it is not necessary to trouble the Reader although the upper End of the first Table was appointed for them  Upon the left Hand of the King's Throne below on the other Side of the Hall was placed a long Table whereat the Nobility dined and this Table had four Side Tables to serve it  And behind this close to the Wall at a shorter Table sat the Lord Mayor Aldermen Recorder and twelve Chief Citizens of  London  who had also two Side Tables to serve them  Lastly was a Table with one Side Table to serve it set for the Officers of Arms whereat they also dined Each Table was furnished with three Courses answerable to that of the King's besides the

attended in the Day Time near the Person of the King and in the Night near his Bedchamber    viz Ferdinando Marsham  and  Henry Norwood  took their Seats upon two little Footstools on either Side of

Conveniency of sitting they sat down  again at the  King's Feet  a good Part of the Dinner Time and until the KING gave them leave to rise he accepting that Time of Session in full Performance of

Plantagenet Duke of Albemarle for Life Subsequent Princes following his Example granted it either during Life or during Pleasure At Length upon the Attainder of the Duke of Buckingham in the Reign of Henry VIII it was suppressed and has ever since been only occasionally revived at the Ceremony of the Coronation It was at this Time executed by Algernon Percy Earl of Northumberland and Knight of the

whereupon the Lord High Chamberlain presented him to the KING who accepted the Service but did not eat thereof  Afterwards a little before the second  Course  was ready Sir  Edward Dymock  to whom the Court of Claims had adjudged the Office of the  King's Champion  as being seized of the Manor of  Scrivelsby  The Manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire is held by the Service of grand Serjeanty by

 Charles  the First the last King deceased to be  right Heir  to the  Imperial Crown  of this  Realm  of  England  or that he ought not to enjoy the same Here is his  Champion  who saith that he lyeth and is a false Traitor being ready in Person to combat with him and in this Quarrel will adventure his Life against him on what Day soever he shall be appointed  Thereupon the  Champion  threw down his  Gantlet  which lying some small Time and nobody taking it up it was delivered unto him again by  York Herald  Then all advanced forward until the  Champion  came to the Middle of the  Hall  when  York Herald  made the like  Proclamation  and the  Gantlet  was again thrown down taken up and returned to the  Champion  who advanced to the  Foot  of the ascending  Steps  to the  State  and at the  Top  of the said  Steps  the said  Herald proclaimed  the said  Challenge  the third Time whereupon the  Champion  threw down his  Gantlet  again which nobody taking up it was delivered unto him  This being done the Earl of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery  assisted as before presented on the Knee to the KING a  gilt Cup  with a  Cover  full of  Wine  who drank to his  Champion  and by the said Earl sent

of  London  presented the KING with  Wine  in a  Gold Cup  having a  Cover  of which the King having drank the  Lord Mayor  received the  Cup  for his  Fee  By this Time the Day being pretty far spent

Loyalty and Affection in the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  THE CEREMONY OF THE CORONATION c  The Anointing Crowning and Inthroning of QUEEN MARY  This Princess was MaryBeatriceEleonora d'Este Daughter of Alphonso Duke of Modena and born in that City September married to James the Second then Duke of York in November by Dr Nathaniel Crew Bishop of Oxford afterwards of Durham She was crowned with that Monarch April and deceased at the Palace of St Germain en Laye in France April  Consort of KING JAMES the  Second  with the Prayers at length which are not to be found in  Sandford  's large History  THE  Anthem  being ended the Archbishop of  Canterbury  went to the Altar and being there the QUEEN arose from her  Chair  on the  South  Side of the  Area  where she had reposed herself during the Time that the KING was Anointed Crowned and Inthronized and being supported by the two Bishops  Dr Peter Mew Bishop of Winchester and Dr Henry Compton Bishop of London  went towards the Altar attended by the Duchess of  Norfolk  and the four Ladies Assistants who constantly bore her  Majesty's Train  together with the Ladies of the Bedchamber and  Kneeled  down at the  Steps  of the  Altar  the  Carpets  and  Cushions  being spread and laid there for  Her  in like manner as they had been before for the KING  Then the Archbishop being at the  North  Side of the  Altar  said this Prayer  Almighty and everlasting GOD the Fountain of all Goodness give Ear we beseech Thee to our Prayers and multiply thy Blessings upon this thy Servant whom in thy Name with all humble Devotion we consecrate OUR QUEEN Defend her always with thy mighty Hand protect her on every Side that she may be able to overcome all her Enemies and that  with SARAH and REBECCA LEAH  and  RACHEL  and other Blessed and Honourable Women  she may multiply and rejoice in the Fruit of her Womb to the Honour of the Kingdom and the good Government of thy Church through CHRIST our LORD  who vouchsafed to be born of a Virgin that he might redeem the World  who liveth and reigneth with thee in UNITY of the HOLY GHOST World without End  This done the QUEEN arose and went to the  Faldstool  at which she was to be Anointed and Crowned placed between King  Edward  's Chair and the Steps of the  Altar  where the Countess of  Peterborough  Groom of the Stole to her  Majesty  with the two Ladies of the Bedchamber assisted by the Queen's Women took off her Rich  Circle  or  Coronet  Then the QUEEN kneeled down and the Archbishop poured the  Holy Oil  on the Crown of her Head in form of a  Cross  using these Words  In the Name of the FATHER the SON and the HOLY GHOST let the anointing of this Oil increase thine Honour and establish thee for ever and ever  After which the same Lady assisted as before opened her Apparel for the anointing her  Majesty  on the  Breast  which the Archbishop also performed pouring on the Holy Oil in form of a  Cross  and using the same Words  viz  In the Name of the FATHER c  After this the Archbishop said this  Prayer  Almighty and everlasting GOD we beseech Thee of thy abundant Goodness pour out the Spirit of thy Grace and Blessing upon this thy Servant QUEEN MARY that as by the Imposition of our Hands she is this Day crowned QUEEN so she may by thy Sanctification continue always thy chosen Servant through CHRIST our LORD  Then the said great Lady with her Assistants having first dried the Place anointed with fine Cotton Wool closed the QUEEN'S Robes at the Breast and after put a Linen Coif upon her Head because of the Anointing  Which done the Archbishop put the RING  Her Majesty's Ring for this Occasion was of Gold with a large Table Ruby set therein and sixteen small Rubies set round the Hoop those next the Collet were the largest the rest diminishing proportionably  which he received from the Master of the  Jewel House  on the fourth Finger of the  Queen's  Right Hand saying  Receive this Ring the  Seal  of a  sincere Faith  that you may avoid all  infection of Heresy and by the Power of GOD compel barbarous Nations and bring them to the Knowledge of the Truth  Then the Archbishop took the CROWN  The Crown made use of at this Solemnity was of Gold set with Diamonds Rubies Emeralds and Pearls of great Value It was composed of Crosses and Fleurs de Lis with Arches and a Mound and Cross on the Top after the Manner of the Imperial Crown wore by the King The Cap was of Purple Velvet lined with white Taffetee and turned up with Ermine  in his Hands from off the Altar and reverently set it upon the  Queen's  Head saying  Receive the Crown of Glory Honour and Joy and GOD the  Crown  of the  Faithful  who by our  Episcopal  Hands though most unworthy hath this Day set a  Crown  of  pure Gold  upon thy Head Enrich you with Wisdom and Virtue that after this Life you may meet the everlasting  Bridegroom  our LORD JESUS CHRIST who with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST liveth and reigneth for ever and ever AMEN  The  Queen  being  crowned  all the  Peeresses  immediately put on their  Coronets  This done the Archbishop put the SCEPTRE  The Sceptre is of Gold adorned with Diamonds and other precious Stones in length two Feet ten Inches with a Mound and Cross at the Top issuing out of a Fleur de Lis  with the  Cross  into her Majesty's Right Hand and the IVORY ROD  This Ivory Rod or Sceptre is in length three Feet one Inch and half the Pomel is Gold as is also the Mound and Cross the Dove at the Top of the Cross is enamelled white the Circumference at Bottom is about two Inches and the other End about an Inch and half  with the  Dove  into her Left Hand and said the following Prayer  O LORD the Fountain of all good Things and the Giver of all Perfection grant unto this thy Servant MARY our QUEEN that she may order aright the high Dignity she hath obtained and with good Works establish the Glory thou hast given her through CHRIST our LORD AMEN  The  Queen  being thus  Anointed  and  Crowned  and having received all the  Royal Ornaments  the  Choirs  sang the following ANTHEM performed by the whole Concert of Voices and Instruments  Psalm xlv ver  My Heart is inditing of a good Matter I speak of the Things which I have made unto the KING  Ver  At his Right Hand shall stand the QUEEN  Ver  All glorious within Her Clothing is of wrought Gold  Ver  She shall be brought unto the

Psalm cxlvii Ver  Praise the LORD O JERUSALEM Praise thy GOD O SION  Isaiah xlix Ver  For  Kings  shall be thy  Nursing Fathers  and their  Queens  thy  Nursing Mothers  AMEN ALLELUJA  As soon as this  Anthem  began the  Queen  arose from her  Faldstool  and being supported by the two Bishops and her Train borne and attended as before went up to the  Theatre  and as she approached towards the  King  bowed herself reverently to his Majesty sitting upon his  Throne  on the Left Hand of the  King  where she reposed herself 'till the  Anthem  was ended  After the  Anthem  there being no Communion the  King  and  Queen  descended and kneeled at their  Faldstools  upon the  Theatre  at the Foot of their  Thrones  whilst the Archbishop said the final Prayers  Assist us mercifully O LORD in these our Supplications and Prayers and dispose the Way of thy Servants towards the Attainment of everlasting Salvation that among all the Changes and Chances of this mortal Life they may ever be defended by thy most gracious and ready Help through JESUS CHRIST our LORD AMEN  O LORD our GOD who upholdest and governest all Things in Heaven and in Earth receive our humble Prayers with our Thanksgivings for our Sovereign Lord JAMES set over us by thy Grace and Providence to be our KING and so together with Him bless his Royal Consort our gracious Queen MARY KATHERINE the Queen  Dowager  their Royal

Servants putting their Trust in Thee may in all their Actions evermore glorify thy Holy Name and by thy Mercy obtain everlasting Life through JESUS CHRIST our LORD AMEN  After which the Archbishop pronounced the BENEDICTION  viz  The Peace of GOD which passeth all Understanding keep your Hearts and Minds in the Knowledge and Love of GOD and of his Son JESUS CHRIST our LORD and the Blessing of GOD ALMIGHTY the FATHER the SON and the HOLY GHOST be amongst you and remain with you always AMEN  APPENDIX  No I QUEEN ELIZABETH'S Coronation Prayer  THE unsettled Times in which this  Princess  lived obliged her to be very circumspect in her Behaviour and she certainly shewed great Wisdom in the several Methods she took to ingratiate herself with and to fix the Affections of her  People  She ascended the Throne  November  the th On Sunday  January  the first she directed the  English  Litany to be restored and publickly read in all Churches and this made way for the Ceremony of her  Coronation  On  Thursday  the th of  January  the Queen went by Water from the Palace at  Westminster  to the TOWER  The Possession of the Tower was anciently accounted a Mark of Sovereignty and therefore our Monarchs repaired thither previous to and in order that Preparations might be there made for their Coronations This was practiced by Henry VIII Edward VI Mary who was accompanied from thence to Westminster by the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Anne Dowager of Cleves Here also the Knights of the Bath were made with great Ceremony  in great Splendor accompanied by the Lord Mayor and the City Corporations in their  Barges  and this was the  Water Triumph  On  Saturday  the th the Queen went in solemn Procession from the  Tower  to  Westminster  which took up many Hours several triumphal  Arches  being erected with  Pageants  and other stately Ornaments according to the Manner of those Days and received variety of Congratulations as she passed  The Citizens of London had a peculiar Affection for this Queen and for a very particular Reason Sir Geoffry Bullen Lord Mayor A D was Great Grandfather to Queen Anne this Queen's Mother This singular Regard shewed itself manifestly in the Cavalcade from the Tower to Westminster at her Coronation May This no doubt influenced them in their Conduct on Elizabeth's Coronation which however was far less splendid and costly  at  Cheapside  Conduir she was presented with a BIBLE  At this Conduit was a Cave out of which came a Person with grey Hairs bald behind with his Glass and Scythe representing TIME followed by a Woman who was arrayed all in white as Painters depict TRUTH to her the old Man delivered a Book which from her was presented to the Queen by one of her Attendants This was richly bound and on the Cover was embroidered VERBUM VERITATIS At this Time also Ranulph Cholemly then Recorder presented one thousand Marks in Gold in a Crimson Velvet Purse the same Sum which had been given to Queen Anne her Mother as a Token of the City's Goodwill which she most graciously received and returned them Thanks and Assurances of her Protection in the kindest Manner  from the City which she graciously received kissed pressed it to her  Heart and promised to read it This was stiled the  City Triumph  and was very costly and magnificent Her  Prayer  was made before she ascended her  Chariot  in the  Tower  after the Example of King SOLOMON and was conceived in the following Terms  The  QUEEN'S PRAYER  O LORD Almighty and everlasting GOD I give thee most hearty Thanks that thou hast been so merciful unto ME as to spare ME to behold this  Joyful Day  And I acknowledge that thou hast dealt as wonderfully and as mercifully with ME as thou didst with thy true and faithful Servant DANIEL thy  Prophet  whom thou deliveredst out of the  Den  from the Cruelty of the greedy and raging  Lions  even so was  I  overwhelmed and only by THEE delivered To THEE therefore only be Thanks Honour and Praise for ever AMEN  The next Day being  Sunday  the th her Majesty with the usual State and Solemnity was crowned in the Collegiate Church of  St  PETER'S  Westminster  The Queen shewed great Steadiness Sagacity and Address in the Conduct of this Affair which though a Point of Ceremony with her Predecessors was matter of great Importance to herself She was determined to restore the Protestant Religion but to restore it by Authority of Parliament The Parliament were to meet after her Coronation and there was only one of the Bishops who could be prevailed upon to crown her The directing the Litany the Epistles and Gospels to be read in English was to shew her Inclinations The retaining the Popish Ceremonies at her Coronation and sending for Bonner's Vestments in which the Bishop of Carlisle officiated and the making the Earl of Arundel High Constable for the Day who had been so at the Coronation of her Sister was to quiet or at least to keep in a State of Incertainty the Papists  by Dr  Owen Oglethorpe  Bishop of  Carlisle  the See of  Canterbury  being then vacant and Dr  Nicholas Heath  Archbishop of  York  who at the Demise of Queen MARY was also Lord High  Chancellor  of  England  declining to officiate because of the Change in Religion At this  Coronation  Sir  Edward Dymock  performed the Service of  Champion  The first Mention of a Champion as we have before observed was at the Coronation of Richard the Second But that there were Champions before is apparent from that very Dispute as also that the Marmions were in Possession of that Office The Estates of that Family were very great and dispersed through several different Counties The Castle of Tanfield was in the Fitz Hughs The Castle of Tamworth belonged to Baldwin Frevile and the Manor of Scrivelsby which Leland spells as it is pronounced Skreelsby came to the Dymocks The Dispute therefore was which of these Manors was held by the Service of performing the Office of Champion at the Coronation and the Court of Claims determined that it was not the Castle of Tamworth but the Manor of Scrivelsby as appears by the Record  to whom the Queen drank in a Cup of Gold which he received for his  Fee  Sir  Thomas Leigh  Mercer  Lord Mayor  presented the Queen with  Ipocras  or Spiced Wine  in a Gold Cup  The same Office had been claimed and executed at the Ceremony of her Mothers Coronation by Sir Stephen Pecock then Lord Mayor of London  of which kneeling before her he made the Assay and the Queen having drank of it returned it to his Lordship who had the Cup and Cover weighing Ounces for his Fee  At the Coronation of her Mother the Lord Mayor had the Gold Cup and Saucer in which he made the Assay and which he carried out of the Hall in his Hand to his Barge It appears from hence that the Lord Mayor claims his Office at the Coronation of a Queen Consort as well as of a King or Queen in their own Right    No II A succinct Account of the Coronation of CHARLES the First  THE King on the d of  February  went from  WestminsterHall  to the Abbey Church attended by the Aldermen of  London  eighty Knights of the Bath in their Robes the Kings Serjeants at Law Sollicitor and Attorney General the Judges Barons Bishops Viscounts and such of the Earls who bore no particular Office that Day in their Parliament Robes going two and two before the King all uncovered and after them followed his Officers of State being eight Earls and one Marquis those Persons according to their respective Places and Offices carried the Swords the Globe the Scepter the Crown and the Lord Mayor of  London  The then Mayor was Sir John Goare and there is no doubt that he executed the same Office and had the same Fees as his Predecessors  carried the short Scepter two Bishops carried the one the Golden Cup  This Gold Cup is no longer in being as will appear from the next Article  and the other the Plate for the Communion Next before his Majesty went the Earl of  Arundel  as Earl MARSHAL of  England  and the Duke of  Buckingham  as Lord HIGH CONSTABLE of  England  for that Day The King being cloathed in white Sattin went under a rich Canopy supported by the Barons of the  Cinque Ports  the King having on each Hand a Bishop and his Train of Purple Velvet was carried up by the Master of the Robes and the Master of the Wardrobe At the entering into the Church Bishop  Laud  Dr Williams Bishop of Lincoln and Dean of Westminster being at this Juncture under his Majesty's or rather under the Duke of Buckingham's Displeasure Dr William Laud at this Time Bishop of St Davids afterwards successively of Bath and Wells London and at length Archbishop of Canterbury officiated in his Stead as Dean of Westminster which Intrusion into another's Province was no small Cause of his subsequent Misfortunes  delivered into the King's Hands the  Staff  of King  Edward  the  Confessor  with which the King walked up to the Throne then the Archbishop of  Canterbury  Dr George Abbot who deceased August  presented his Majesty to the Lords and Commons there present East West North and South who gave their Consent to his Coronation as their lawful Sovereign After Sermon was done the King went to the Altar to take the CORONATION OATH  This Oath together with all the other Ceremonies had been first settled by a Commission to the Bishops then by a Committee of the Privy Council and lastly administered to the King by the Archbishop than whom no Man had greater Regard to the Liberty of the Subject or stood fairer in the Opinion of the People notwithstanding which it was surmised that this Oath was altered or interpolated which however was not charged upon the Archbishop but upon his Successor Archbishop Land  which was performed in this Manner  ARCHBISHOP Sir Will you grant and keep and by your Oath confirm to the  People  of  England  the  Laws  and  Customs  to them granted by the  Kings  of  England  your lawful and Religious  Predecessors  and namely the  Laws Customs  and  Franchises  granted to the  Clergy  by the glorious King  St Edward  your  Predecessor  according to the  Laws  of GOD the true Profession of the  Gospel  established in this  Kingdom  agreeable to the  Prerogative for the Kings thereof  This was surmised to be an Interpolation and if so to have been made by Dr Laud The Charge against him was offered under Colour of Evidence on the Seventh Article of his Impeachment The Archbishop in Defence of himself justified the Words of the Oath though at the same Time he denied the Interpolation and appealed to the old Forms several of which he said were in his Study when his Books were seized None of these however could be found except the Coronation of King James the First which with much Difficulty he got to be compared by the Lords when both Oaths appeared to be exactly the same The Archbishop also appealed to the Votes of the House of Commons in which upon examining those Oaths they had themselves resolved that they were exactly the same  and the ancient  Customs  of the  Realm  KING I Grant and Promise to keep them  ARCHBISHOP Sir will you keep Peace and Godly Agreement according to your Power both to GOD the Holy Church the Clergy and the People  KING I will keep it  ARCHBISHOP Sir will you to your Power cause  Law Justice  and  Discretion  in  Mercy and Truth  to be executed to your  Judgment  KING I will  ARCHBISHOP Sir will you grant to hold and keep the  Laws  and  Rightful Customs  which the  Commonalty  of this your  Kingdom  have and will you defend and uphold them to the  Honour  of GOD so much as in you lieth  KING I grant and promise so to do  It was supposed that the Answer should have been  I will  the Reader will judge if the Answer had been so whether it had been stronger or weaker    Then one of the Bishops read this Passage to the King  Our  Lord  and  King  we beseech you to  pardon  and to grant and to preserve unto us and to the  Churches  committed to your Charge all Canonical Privileges and due Law and Justice and that you would  protect  and  defend  us as every good King in his Kingdom ought to be Protector and Defender of the Bishops and the  Churches  under their Government  The KING answered  With a willing and devout Heart I promise and grant my Pardon and that I will preserve and maintain to you and the  Churches  committed to your Charge all Canonical Privileges and due  Law  and  Justice  and that I will be your  Protector  and  Defender  to my Power by the  Assistance  of GOD as every good King in his Kingdom in right ought to protect and defend the  Bishops  and  Churches  under their Government  Then the KING arose and was led to the Communion Table where he took a SOLEMN OATH in sight of all the People to observe all the  Premisses  and laying his Hand upon the BIBLE said  The things which I have here  promised  I shall  perform  and  keep  So help me GOD and the Contents of this Book  After the OATH the KING was placed in the Chair of Coronation and was  anointed  by the  Archbishop  and the ancient Robes of King  Edward  the  Confessor  was put upon him and the  Crown  of that Prince put upon his Head and his  Sword  girt about him and he  offered  the same and  two  Swords more together with  Gold  and  Silver  at the  Communion  Table He was afterwards conducted by the  Nobility  to the  Throne  where this Passage was read to his  Majesty  Stand and hold fast from henceforth the  Place  to which you have been  Heir  by the Succession of your Forefathers being now delivered to you by the Authority of ALMIGHTY GOD and by the Hands of us and all the  Bishops  and  Servants  of GOD and as you see the  Clergy  to come nearer the  Altar  than others so remember that in all Places convenient you give them greater Honour that the MEDIATOR of GOD and Man may establish you in the Kingly  Throne  to be a  Mediator  betwixt the  Clergy  and the  Laity  and that you may Reign for ever with JESUS CHRIST the KING of KINGS and LORD of LORDS  Afterwards the  Nobility  were sworn to be Homagers to the King and some other Ceremonies were performed which being done the Lord  Keeper  Sir Thomas Coventry to whom the Custody of the Great Seal was given November  by the KING'S Command read a Writing unto them  which declared the King's FREE PARDON to all his Subjects who would take the same under the  Great Seal  The  Ceremonies  of the  Coronation  being ended the  Regalia  were  offered  at the  Altar  by Bishop  Laud  This Offering of the Regalia though the constant Practice in all Reigns Protestant as well as Popish was offered in Evidence against the Archbishop at his Trial  in the  King  's Name and then  repofited  No III An Account of the ancient REGALIA which were  destroyed  and  dissipated  in the Time of the  Commonwealth  AFTER the  Restoration  of King  Charles  the  Second  Commissioners were appointed  It is remarkable that the House of Lords while the King was yet at the Hagne appointed a Committee for this Purpose of recovering the late King's Goods who appointed Mr Kynnersley afterwards one of the Officers of the Wardrobe to King Charles the Second to seize and secure such Effects wherever they could be found  to enquire after and recover such of the Crown Jewels and Furniture belonging to the King's Palaces as had been  embezzled  from the Time of the breaking out of the  civil  War These Commissioners called before them Mr  Thomas Beauthamp  who had been  Secretary  to the  Committee  for disposing of King  Charles  the  First's  Goods and Effects and he to exculpate himself laid before them the Books and Papers that were in his Custody from whence the following Account was extracted which is equalty circumstantial and curious shewing how these  Insignia  of  Royalty  which had escaped through so many  Changes  and  Revolutions  were at length irrecoverably dispersed in Hopes that  Monarchy  would never have revived  The IMPERIAL CROWN weighing  seven  Pounds six Ounces enriched with  nineteen  Saphires three of which were exceeding large  two hundred thirty two  Pearls  fifty eight  Rubies  twenty eight  Diamonds and  two  Emeralds  The QUEEN'S CROWN weighing  three  Pounds  ten  Ounces and  one half  enriched with  twenty  Saphires  twenty two  Rubies and  eighty three  Pearls  An  ancient Crown  This appears to have been the Crown of Edward the Confessor in Imitation of which that was made which has been since used in the Ceremony of the Coronation of our Kings This Monarch died on the Eve of the Feast of the Epiphany Ann Dom and by his Charter endowed the Monastery of Westminster which was of his own Foundation with all the Ensigns of Royalty which himself had used and likewise those that had descended to him from his Ancestors  weighing  two  Pounds  one  Ounce enriched  with  one  fair Diamond valued by the Trustees who rated such Things far beneath their worth at  two hundred  Pounds  thirteen  other Diamonds  ten  Rubies  one  Emerald  one  Saphire valued by them at  sixty  Pounds and  seventy  Pearls which Stones and Pearls weighed  three  Ounces  The GLOBE or ORB weighing  one  Pound  five  Ounces and one quarter  Two  Coronation Bracelets  adorned with  three  Rubies  Ballas  and  twelve  Pearls weighing an Ounce in all  seven  Ounces  one  quarter  Two  Scepters  weighing  eighteen  Ounces  one

Ballas Rubies weighing  fifteen  Ounces and  one  half  Two  Patenas  Patena in the Romish Church is the Cover or Lid of the Chalice made of the same Metal therewith serving to hold the Particles of the Host and given the People to kiss when they make an offering  enamelled weighing  twenty five  Ounces and one half  Two  Spoons  with  flat  Heads weighing  five  Ounces  one  quarter  One  Taster  enamelled with a  Phaenix  weighing  five  Ounces  one  half  Two  Offering Pieces  and a Sey Assay of Gold weighing  ten  Ounces  one  quarter  QUEEN EDITHS  This Queen Edith was the Daughter of Earl Godwin and the Comfort of King Edward with whom by mutual Consent she lived in continual Chastity  Crown  formerly thought to be of massy Gold but upon Trial found Silver gilt enriched with Garnets Pearls Saphires and other Stones weighing  fifty  Ounces  KING ALFRED'S  It is much to be regretted that we have no Description whatever of this Crown King Alfred received rich Presents from Pope Marinus and the Emperor Charlemagne and possibly this Crown and some others of these rich Utchsils might be amongst them  Crown  of  Gold Wirework  set with Stones and two little  Bells  weighing  seventy nine  Ounces and  one  half  A  Patena  enamelled set with Stones weighing  twenty three  Ounces and  one  half  The AMPULLA set with Stones and Pearls weighing  eight  Ounces  one half  A  large Staff  with a  Dove  on the  Top  the upper part Gold the lower Part Silver gilt weighing  twenty seven  Ounces  A  small Staff  with a  Flower de lis  on the  Top  being Iron within and Silver gilt without  Two  Scepters  one set with Pearls and Stones the upper end Gold weighing  twenty three  Ounces the lower End Silver gilt The other Scepter Silver gilt having a Dove weighing  seven  Ounces  three  quarters  The  Gold  of the  Tassels  of a liver coloured  Robe  adorned with Pearl weighing  four  Ounces also the Gold of the Neck Button of the Coat weighing  one  Ounce  A Pair of  Silver gilt Spurs  set with  twelve  Stones having Straps of Crimson Silk weighing  six  Ounces  three  quarters  Besides these there were other Parts of the REGALIA fetched from  Westminster Abbey  and sold by these Trustees namely  One large  Chalice  of Glass wrought in Figures and set in Gold with Stones and Pearls weighing  sixty eight  Ounces  one  half  A  Staff  of  black  and  white Ivory  having a  Dove  on the Top the Binding and Feet Gold  A  Silver Spoon  gilt weighing  three  Ounces  One  Crimson Taffaty Robe  One  Robe  trimmed with Gold Lace  One Liver coloured  Silk Robe  One  Robe  of crimson Taffaty Sarsenet  One Pair of  Buskins  As for the Form of the Buskin and Sandal they may be seen in the Frontispiece marked D and E but how they came to be used is a Question to which none of our learned Heralds have supplied us with any competent Answer It appears however from our ancient Historians that the Kings and Queens even to the Time of Richard the Third and his Consort were accustomed to come barefooted to St Edward's Shrine and this being the Case Buskins and Sandals were very convenient to put upon the Legs and Feet as it might be done sooner and with greater Ease than Stockings and Shoes    Cloth of Silver  One Pair of  Shoes  Cloth of Gold  One Pair of embroidered  Gloves  Three  Swords  with  Scabbards  Cloth of Gold  One  Horn Comb  King  Charles  the  First  to do Honour to himself the Nation and the  most noble  Order of the  Garter  when he sent it to that great  Protestant  Hero GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS King of SWEDEN  The usual Weight of the Collar according to the Statutes of the Order is no more than thirty Ounces but the King thought proper to exceed it in Honour of so great a Prince The Ensigns of the Order were sent by Mr Peter Young Gentleman Usher and Mr Henry St George Richmond Herald as Deputies to Sir William Segar Garter King at Arms with which Ensigns that Monarch was invested in his Tent being then before the Town of Darshaw in Pruffia the d of September At this Time his Swedish Majesty created the said Mr St George a Knight by Letters Patents and as a farther Mark of Honour granted him permission to bear his own Arms on a Canton  caused the  Gold COLLAR of  thirty four  Ounces and a  quarter  to be most exquisitely wrought and in his GEORGE which weighed  seven  Ounces there were  eighty seven  Diamonds some of them very large and fine and the MOTTO on the  Garter  was composed of  four hundred  and  eleven  Diamonds This being restored upon that Monarch's Death  This victorious Prince the Protector of the reformed Religion and of the Liberties of Germany died gloriously in the Field November  was sent to  Windsor  and committed to the Custody of the  Dean  and  Chapter  who at the Beginning of the  civil  War  buried  it in St  George  's Chapel where being discovered by  Cornelius Holland  the  Trustees  for the Sale of the King's Goods sent  John Hunt  their  Treasurer  to fetch it and by them together with the  Collar  and  George  it was sold to their Servant  Thomas Beauchamp  The  Collar  of the  Order  worn by King CHARLES the  First  which weighed  thirtyfive  Ounces falling into the Hands of Major General  Harrison  was by him delivered into the Hands of the  Trustees  for the Sale of the King's Effects and was by their Order sent to the  Mint  out of which the first Pieces were coined which bore the Arms of what was then stiled the  Commonwealth  These Pieces of Gold were of the Value of twenty Shillings ten Shillings and five Shillings having on one Side a St  George  's Cross stamped with these Words circumscribed  The Commonwealth of England  and on the other Side the  Cross  and  Harp  with this Motto  God with us    The  Garter  worn by the  King  upon his left Leg at the Time of his  Death  had the Letters composed of Diamonds to the Number of  four hundred  and  twelve  of different Sizes and was esteemed the most rich and elegant Ornament of the Kind that till then had been made  This is said on the Authority of Mr Ashmole a consummate Judge of such Things It may not be amiss to remark that it appears upon the Journal of the House of Commons the very Day after the King's Death upon the Report of Commissary Ireton in Relation to this some other Things and particularly a Couple of Seals which were found in his Majesty's Pockets that they should be sent to his Son Charles Stuart but the Question being put severally upon each of them it was carried in the Negative upon them all  This Princely Ensign came into the Hands of Captain  Preston  who commanded a Troop of  Cromwell  's Horse by whom it was delivered to the  Trustees  who sold it to Alderman  John Ireton  who executed A D the Office of  Mayer  of  London  for the Sum of  two hundred  and  five  Pounds  This Alderman Ireton was a very active Man in those Days He had been a Member for the City of London in that Parliament in which they had Six Representatives He was knighted by Oliver and upon the Restoration was one of the twenty Persons excepted out of the Act of Oblivion and disabled from holding any Office  This Mr  Ireton  being summoned before the King's Commissioners after the Restoration and the Matter of Fact stated to him he did not deny that the  Garter  had been  fold  to him and sold for that  Price  But being offered a  Composition  which was their Method in all Cases of that Nature he absolutely  refused  it upon which the King's  Attorney General  Sir Jeoffry Palmer Knight and Baronet  was directed to bring an Action against him of  Trover  and  Conversion  which he accordingly did in the  King'sBench  where it was tried in  TrinityTerm  the  Sixteenth  of  Charles  the  Second  where upon a full Hearing a  Verdict  was given for the  King  against the said  John Ireton  for the Sum of  two hundred  and  five  Pounds with  ten  Pounds  Costs  of  Suit  These Particulars in Relation to the  Loss  of the ancient  Regalia  and other  Jewels  of the  Crown  being equally curious and authentic  The Matters of Fact are taken from Mr Ashmole who transcribed them from the Inventory of the King's Effects and from the Minutes of the Commissioners Proceedings  cannot fail of being satisfactory to the judicious Reader  No IV  THE paffing through the CITY in grand  Cavalcade  from the  Tower  to  Westminster  the Day preceding the  Coronation  was a  Spectacle  so grateful to the  People  that it was not omitted anciently except for very cogent Reasons At the Coronation of King  James  the  First  and  Anne  his  Queen  the  Plague  raged in  London  The like Misfortune of a Plague raging happened in the Eighteenth of Henry the Sixth when the Commons sent up a Bill to ordain and grant by the Authority of this present Parliament that every of your Lieges in the doing of their Homage may omit the kissing of you and be excused thereof and have their Letters of doing their Homage the kissing of you  itted notwithstanding This had the Concurrence of the Lords and the Royal Assent being stiled an Act for the Preservation of the King's Person  and therefore the  Citizens  were forbid by  Proclamation  except the Lord  Mayor Aldermen  and  twelve  grave respectable  Assistants  to come to that Solemnity What the Reason was of its Omission at the Coronation of  Charles  the  First  we cannot now discover But  Charles  the  Second  on his  Restoration  very wisely restored it and a most magnificent Ceremony it was But being now out of Use we thought it more proper to be inserted in the  Appendix  and that too with all the  Brevity  possible  If the Reader is inclined to see it at large he may have Recourse to Mr  Ogilby  's Account of this City Triumph most magnificently printed by the King's Command and adorned with Sculptures    His Majesty on the d of  April  early in the Morning passed from  Whitehall  to the  Tower  by Water in order to go from thence to  Westminster  There he found the  Knights  of the  Bath  ready to attend him who had been made some Nights before with great Solemnity and according to all the  ancient Forms  This Ceremony was performed in  Henry  the Seventh's Chapel they dined afterwards together in the  Painted Chamber  and proceeded with the Heralds before them from thence in great Solemnity to  Whitehall  and at their Return were informed that they were to attend his Majesty in his Procession from the  Tower  The CITY upon this Occasion were at a very  great Expence  to which as it was understood they were obliged by their  Charter  and all  Ranks  and Degrees of  People  vied with each other in the Magnificence of their Dress that the  Foreign Ministers  who were present upon this Occasion  The Readers may see the Names of all these foreign Ministers in the Account of the Coronation of King  Charles  the Second  might return home with high Ideas of the Opulence of this Nation which the Writers of those Times say had its Effects and constrained them to confess that never any of them had seen a Procession approaching it in Splendor  Preparatory thereto the  four  following stately and triumphal  Arches  were erected  The  first  in  LeadenhallStreet  near  LimeStreet  after the  Doric  Order represented the King's  happy Arrival  in  England  The  second  being a  Naval Representation  was near the  Royal Exchange Cornhill  The  third  consisting of the  Corinthian  and  Composite  Order and representing the TEMPLE of CONCORD was placed in  Cheapside  near  Woodstreet  The  fourth  consisting of the  Doric  and

relative to the CORONATION  THE  Scots  so early as the  first  Seffion of the  first  Parliament of King  James  the  Sixth  framed an  Act  for establishing an  Oath  to be taken by their  Kings  at their  Coronation  for the Maintenance and Preservation of the  Protestant Religion  After the Revolution by an  Act  in the  first  Year of the Reign of King  William  and Queen  Mary  the  Coronation Oath  was fixed and settled as it was to be taken by their then  Majesties  and their Successors By another  Act  in the  Second  Seffion of the same Parliament for declaring the  Rights  and  Liberties  of the  Subject  and settling the  Succession  of the  Crown  a farther Provision is made by appointing the  Declaration  mentioned in the  Statute  of the  thirtieth  Year of  Charles  the  Second  to be made and taken by the  King  or  Queen  By an  Act  passed in the  fifth  Year of her late Majesty Queen  Anne  Provision is made for the Support and Maintenance of the  Church  of  England  and by an  Act  in the same Reign passed in  Scotland  previous and preparatory to the UNION the like Care is taken for the Preservation of the  Protestant  Religion and  Presbyterian  Church Government in that Kingdom By these several  Laws  the Directions of which have been ever since punctually complied with the civil and religious  Rights  of the  Subject  have been effectually settled and secured and all Causes of Jealousy in respect to the  Power  of the  Crown  have been entirely and happily  removed  FINIS
