 THE PLATONICK LADY A Comedy As it is Acted at the QUEENS THEATRE IN THE  HAYMARKET  By the Author of the  Gamester  and  Love's Contrivance  LONDON  Printed for  James Knapton  at the  Crown  in St  Paul  's ChurchYard and  Egbert Sanger  at the  PostHouse  at the  MiddleTempleGate  in  Fleetstreet  Price  s    d  Where may be had all Sorts of PLAYS  To all the Generous Encouragers of  Female Ingenuity  this  Play  is Humbly Dedicated  Gentlemen and Ladies  MY Muse chose to make this Universal Address hoping among the numerous Crowd to find some Souls Great enough to protect her against the Carping Malice of the Vulgar World who think it a proof of their Sense to dislike every thing that is writ by Women I was the more induc'd to this General Application from the Usage I have met on all sides  A Play secretly introduc'd to the House whilst the Author remains unknown is approv'd by every Body The Actors cry it up and are in expectation of a great Run the Bookseller of a Second Edition and the Scribler of a Sixth Night But if by chance the Plot's discover'd and the Brat found Fatherless immediately it flags in the Opinion of those that extoll'd it before and the Bookseller falls in his Price with this Reason only  It is a Woman's  Thus they alter their Judgment by the Esteem they have for the Author tho' the Play is still the same They ne'er reflect that we have had some MaleProductions of this kind void of Plot and Wit and full as insipid as ever a Woman's of us all  I can't forbear inserting a Story which my Bookseller that printed my  Gamester  told me of a Spark that had seen my  Gamester  three or four times and lik'd it extremely Having bought one of the Books ask'd who the Author was and being told a Woman threw down the Book and put up his Money saying he had spent too much after it already and was sure if the Town had known that it wou'd never have run ten days No doubt this was a Wit in his own Eyes It is such as these that rob us of that which inspires the Poet Praise And it is such as these made him that Printed my Comedy call'd  Love's Contrivance  or  Medin  cin Malgre lui  put two Letters of a wrong Name to it which tho' it was the height of Injustice to me yet his imposing on the Town turn'd to account with him and thus passing for a Man's it has been play'd at least a hundred times  And why this Wrath against the Womens Works Perhaps you'll answer because they meddle with things out of their Sphere But I say no for since the Poet is born why not a Woman as well as a Man Not that I wou'd derogate from those great Men who have a Genius and Learning to improve that Genius I only object against those illnatur'd Criticks who wanting both think they have a sufficient claim to Sense by railing at what they don't understand Some have arm'd themselves with resolution not to like the Play they paid to see and if in spite of Spleen they have been pleas'd against their Will have maliciously reported it was none of mine but given me by some Gentleman Nay even my own Sex which shou'd assert our Prerogative against such Detractors are often backward to encourage a Female Pen  Wou'd these profest Enemies but consider what Examples we have had of Women that excell'd in all Arts in Musick Painting Poetry also in War Nay to our immortal Praise what Empresses and Queens have fill'd the World What cannot  England  boast from Women The mighty  Romans  felt the Power of  Boadicea  's Arm  Eliza  made  Spain  tremble but  ANN  the greatest of the Three has shook the Man that aim'd at Universal Sway After naming this Miracle the Glory of our Sex sure none will spitefully cavil at the following Scenes purely because a Woman writ'em This I dare venture to say in their behalf there is a Plot and Story in them I hope will entertain the Reader which is the utmost Ambition of  Gentlemen and Ladies  Your most obedient humble Servant  PROLOGUE  By Captain  Farqubar  Spoken by Mr  Betterton  REjoice ye Fair the  British  Warrior's come  Victorious o're to your soft Wars at home  Each Conqueror flies with eager Longing's fraught  To clasp the Darling Fair for which he fought  He lays his Trophies down

With the same Fire with which our Hero's fight  Or cou'd our Stage but represent a Scene  To Copy that on great  Ramillis  Plain  Then we with Courage wou'd assert our Plays  And to your glorious Laurels joyn our Bays  But our poor  Pegasus  a Beast of ease  Cares not for foraging beyond the Seas  Content with  London  Provender he flyes  To make each Coxcomb he can find a Prize  And after

Expences of our Summers Expedition from  Epsom  to  Tunbridge  from  Tunbridge  to the  Bath  and from thence to  London  here where instead of Boardwages I have liv'd upon Hopes that some of these Places wou'd furnish you with a Bubble and me with my Money but I see no appearance of it Therefore pray let you and I discount  Sharp  Prithee  Equipage  have but Patience to see what this Winter produces  Equi  No Sir the Affront you put upon me at  Tunbridge  I can't forget when you had lost fifty Guineas to the Knight upon Honour and pretended you had sent  me Post to  London  to your Scrutore for the Money and that I had robb'd you and run away with your Keys when you ordered me to keep out of the way till he had left the Town  Sharp  Thou know'st I had no other quibble to avoid paying the Debt and quitting the Place with Honour Come don't reflect upon my Misfortune we have seen better Summers  Equi  In troth Sir I thought  Bath  promis'd well I am sure 'twas very full of Company and if you had not fallen in Love you might have paid me out of the Subscription  Sharp  How must I have liv'd like a Gentleman then Sirrah I shall break your Head  Equi  I have done upon that Subject Sir I only desire my Discharge and Wages that's all  Sharp  Do you know what you ask  Equipage  A Gamester and a Soldier are both Sons of Fortune now to quit my Service is directly to embroil your self with Fortune  Equi  I have been embroil'd with her from the first Day I enter'd into your Service But I thank my Stars I am above Fortune and design to forsake the World  Sharp  Ha ha forsake the World  Equi  Yes Sir I have lately made some moral Reflections on the Uncertainty of worldly Pleasures I am weary of being well beaten and ill fed of passing the Night at a Tavern Door and the Day in carrying Messages from one Miss to another In short Sir I am weary of the subservient Title without the subservient Money and resolve to marry that is when I can find a Woman that deserves me  Sharp  A difficult matter truly  Equi  So it is Sir but this Digression makes you forget that there is a small Rule in Arithmetick to be adjusted I have serv'd you these eight Years at twentyfive  Crowns a Year which in plain  English  is fortytwo Pounds Sterling of which I have received now and then a broken Pate Nevertheless there remains two and forty Pounds which I desire you'd give me immediately Sir  Sharp  Two and Forty Poundsa great deal of Moneyeight Years Service Mercy upon me How have I had Patience to endure this Dog so long  Equi  How have I had Patience to stay thus long for my Wages  Sharp  Are not you a Rogue Sirrah  Equi  Yes Sir  Sharp  And deserve to be hang'd  Equi  As Affairs stands now it seems Whilst I was silent I was a very honest Fellow but now I ask for my Wages I'm fit for the Gallows Faith Sir you might be a Duke by your Conscience  Sharp  Well Sirrah you know I am good natur'd hang me if I am not very unwilling to part with thee I will not turn thee away go get my Cloak  Equi  Turn me away why 'tis not you that turn me away 'tis I that turn you away if you go to that  Sharp  Well well we won't dispute about that thou shalt not leave me  Equi  Be pleas'd to pay me then for I design the Money for my Wife's Jointure Look ye Sir here's the Receipt ready  Sharp  The Devil's in the Fellow I think thy Noddle runs of nothing but thy own Business prithee let's think a little of mine Mrs  Brazen  the Matchmaker is to help me to a  Somersetshire  Widow worth fifty thousand Pound she's just come to Town  Equi  But pray Sir consider my Business  Sharp  I tell you I am in haste to see her  Equi  'Tis done in one word Sir my Wages  Sharp  Well since you are so resolute we will part tho' it trouble me never so much Give me the Receipt Let's see how you have drawn it  Equi  There Sir  Gives it him  Sharp  Now begon I discharge you  Equi  But my Wages Sir  Sharp  Ah  Equipage Equipage  the parting with thee softens me even into Tears If I stay I shall unman my self Farewel  Exit  Equi  The Devil did not I know him well enough not to trust him with the Receipt till I had the Money But egad I'll be even with him one way I'll have his cowardly Bones well beaten if my Project takes  Exit  SCENE Changes to  Isabella's  Lodgings  Enter  Isabella  and  Toylet  Toy  I can't imagine from whence proceeds this change You that us'd to love Parks Plays Balls DrawingRooms Picquet Baslett and such nice Conversation You'd not endure my Lady  Lockup  because she entertain'd you with nothing but railing at her Servants of their Waste and her good Housewifery nor Mr  Selflove  because he always got to the Glass before you my Lady  Wrinkle  laid on too much White and my Lady  Blouze  too much Red and Mrs  Coquet  engross'd the whole Company My Lady  Prattle  fill'd your Ears with the Beauty and Wit of her Children  Isa  And is there any thing so disagreeable on Earth as the Sayings of Miss and Mass repeated But what of all this  Toy  Why then I wrack my poor Brain in finding out why you spend so much time with your Country Cousin Mrs  Dowdy  who is the very reverse of every thing you us'd to admire  Isa  Charity  Toylet  perfect Charity You know my aukward Cousin wants Instructions She's left a rich Widow and comes to  London  on purpose to Dress and make a Figure  Toy  Born and bred in  Somersetshire  never five Miles from Home before wore the Cloath of her own Spinning dain'd to make her own Butter paid the Labourers their Wages on Workdays and took a Jigg with them on Holydays She will make a Figure indeed by that time the Fashionmungers have done with her Pardon me Madam if I can't help thinking you have some stronger Motive than Charity  Isa  What does your Wisdom guess  Toy  Why truly Madam I should guess your Ladyship may have some small Pulse for the handsome young Officer that Mrs  Dowdy  is so much affraid you should see and thrust you into the BedChamber when he came into the DiningRoom I remember with what Fury you catch'd up the redhot Poker and burnt a Hole through the Door to look at him  Belvil  I think they call his Name  Isa  Upon my Life thou hast hit it Girl I'll not conceal my Plot since I design thee Chief Instrument  f you remember I told you that five Years since I was in  France  and my Mother's Sister being of the  Romish  Perswasion had enter'd her self among the  Augustines  in  Paris  She overperswaded me to Board there too hoping I suppose from her endeavours to make me quit my Religion and profess my self a Nun During my aboad there this very Gentleman us'd to make me frequent Visits at the Grate the first time I saw him he came a long with another  that paid a Compliment to a young Lady of the same Convent Our Acquaintance held near two Months 'Twas then  Toylet  that I felt the force of Love but not without a thousand Protestations of the same from him But my Father hearing of my Aunts design and apprehending my Youth for I was then not full sixteen might be prevail'd upon to change my Faith sent for me to  England  in such haste that I was not permitted to stay one Hour in the Monastery after the Messenger arrived so had no opportunity to inform  Belvil  of my Departure  Toy  I presume you've kept a Correspondence ever since  Isa  No I knew not how to direct to him he told me he had been bred in the  SpanishNetherlands  and came to  France  only for his Pleasure His Parents he said were  English  and he spoke the Language very well  Toy  Nor did not you inform him of your Family  Isa  He often prest it and I promis'd to satisfie him but my Father's unexpected Commands broke all our Measures and from that Day till I saw him here I never heard of him  Toy  And what is your Design now Madam I fear he is a Man of Gallantry besides you know he makes love to your Cousin you cannot love him still sure  Isa  Indeed I do nay more can love nothing else  Toy  What will you do with Sir  Charles Richley  then who your Father upon his DeathBed enjoyn'd you to marry whom he contracted you to in your Childhood  Isa  I cannot love him it was in my Nonage and the Barter's illegal and therefore I'll not Mind it besides I'm inform'd he is in Love elsewhere and cares as little for me as I for him and I would not be a Wife i'th' Mode  Toy  In my Opinion Sir  Charles  has all the Accomplishments of his Sex and a fair Estate  Isa  I own it but I have a whimsical Heart not to be touch'd with Jointures and Settlements  Toy  And if I have any skill in Faces  Belvil  is a general Lover  Isa  No matter my Conquest will be the greater to get him from them all besides I will run any risk to break this unreasonable Contract  Toy  What you please Madam I am ready to convey a Letter or a Message to him  Isa  No I have a Stratagem to try his Temper and fathom his Inclinations I do not intend to discover my self to him till I have him within my Power beyond a possibility of retreat Come in with me and I'll give thee a full Relation and prepare our selves for my design  Exit  The SCENE Changes to  Belvil  's Lodgings  Belvil  in a NightGown playing on a Flute he lays it down and looks upon his Watch  Bel  Ha 'tis

No I know the Hand Egad it is as hard to get rid of a Citizen's Wife when listed in her Service as Subsistance out of the Hand of an Agent who is just setting up his Coach She's as troublesome as a Dun when our Stock's exhausted  Robin  Here's another Letter Sir and the Footman stays for an Answer  Bel  Lucinda  's Character Slave how durst you defer my Joy so long  Robin  Oh Sir ever whilst you

employ'd in her Dress she spares no Art to charm you there's Milleners Mantuamakers Tirewomen and so forth  Bel  My Watch  Peep  Amongst a Crowd of Compleaters a Match maker has shuffled in and proposes one Sir  John Sharper  to her if you are cold you'll lose her upon my Virginity you will  Bel  My Sword  Peep  Ha how careless you are what not a Word In Truth I don't know where you'll find

shall care Threepence for her without one thing  Peep  But her Fortune Sir  Bel  Shall never tempt me to marry her at a venture  Peep  No why then to what purpose do you court her 'Tis calling your Gallanty in question to suspect an Intreague  Bel  No faith  Peeper  my design is quite another thing and if thou wou'dst assist me  Peep  In any thing Sir within my Power  Bel  Say'st thou there then  Gives her Money  When we wou'd have a Lawyer plead heartily we must not forget his Fee  Peep  You are so generous that to keep up the Simile Lawerlike I'll spare no Breath to serve you  Bob  But don't you carry the Simile too far and take Bribes on both sides  Peep  I scorn it Instruct me Sir  Bel  Find some way to persuade her to let me see the Writings of her Estate tell her 'tis the only way to fix me for what ever we say in Commendation of your Sex Beauty Shape Wit and so forth is but the Fable the Moral is the Money Girl  Peep  But you won't marry her you say Sir  Bel  Not till I am satisfied what she's worth my Dear but these Writings must be seen Upon Honour it  shall turn as much to your Account whether I marry her or not  Peep  Nay thenWell Sir it shall be done when will you prove it  Bel  Two Hours hence  Peep  Your Servant  Exit  Enter Sir  Charles Richley  Sir Cha  What just upon the Wing I'm glad I've nick't the time and find you without Company  Bel  Why have you Secrets to impart  Robin  leave us  Exit  Robin    Come come disclose some warm wishing kind consenting Fair Or is it a plump soft wholesome Country Girl thou woud'st consign over to thy Friend 'm not nice nor care who plucks the Rose I smell to provided it has not lost its sweetness  Sir Cha  Sure thou thinkest the Business of the World is converted into Wenching  Bel  I'm sure there's no pleasure in that Business where a Woman is not concern'd  Sir Cha  A Woman is the Subject But such a Woman  Bel  Bright as the Morn when first the World began  And I am doom'd to be the happy Man  Sir Cha  I fear so  Belvil  Bel  Then she is in Love with me where does she live what's her Name how dignify'd or distinguish'd by Mistress Madam or Right HonourableMaid Wife or Widow Quick quick disclose  Sir Cha  'Tis  Lucinda  Bel  The Devil have you rais'd my expectation to this height then pall me with an Acquaintance But what of her  Sir Cha  You brought me into the Danger I came wounded off and have no hopes of Cure but from your roving Temper You weigh the Sex alike and without a Pang may give me leave to try my Fortune with her  Bel  This comes of carrying a Friend to see one's Mistriss Why I thought you had been engag'd from your Childhood Come will you be upon the square bring me to your Mistriss if I like her as well as I do  Lucinda  perhaps we may agree upon the change  Sir Cha  I will she cannot fail to charm thee all Eyes but mine adore her And sure 'twas the Malice of our Stars caus'd our Fathers to conclude the Match where Interest only held the Scale and gentle Love fled from either side But be serious How far are you engag'd with  Lucinda  Bel  Faith 'tis a kind of intricate Story but you must be satisfied I have been bred a Soldier of Fortune and am to this Day ignorant who my Parents were The Man who took care of me always told me  England  was my Native Country taught me the Language and for ought I know some travelling Prince begot me My FosterFather was in Battle kill'd and never gave me farther Light I had still an Inclination to see this Country  Sir Cha  This Story seems Romantick  Bel  You'll think it so before I have done Being landed and travelling with my Servant towards  London  I lost my way Night came on when at a distance we discovered Lights and made up to 'em It proved  Lucinda  's Country House Her Uncle Sir  Thomas Beamont  kindly receiv'd and entertain'd us  Sir Cha  Lucky Chance  Bel  So it prov'd to them for that very Night her House was beset with Thieves Their number must have prevail'd but for our unexpected Aid we beat them off preserv'd their Wealth and perhaps their Lives The Lady  express'd a thousand Thanks The old Man grew Inquisitive who I was and whence I came I frankly told him the Story of my Life He stood amaz'd and ask'd me fifty Questions and seem'd surpriz'd at every Answer  Sir Cha  Well and what ensu'd upon that  Bel  Why he has ever since been mighty fond of me and forc'd Money upon me which I could scarcely make him take my Note for  Sir Cha  You're establish'd every way his kindness promotes you Interest with his Niece  Bel  Quite contrary His generous Carriage has oblig'd me to swear to him never to attempt to marry her if she should consent without his leave which he seems still averse to I confess I love her beyond the rest of her Sex except one I saw thro' a Grate in  France  that I could never hear of since yet this restraint keeps me from pressing my Suit for Marriage and I have too much respect to attempt the other  Sir Cha  Does she know the Injunction  Bel  No that he forbad me tooBesides she is devoted to Platonick Notions  Sir Cha  I never mind that in a handsome Woman This generous Declaration draws another Question why do you address Mrs  Dowdy  Bel  That's another Injunction of the old Gentleman's to procure the Writings of an Estate out of her Hands that her Husband cheated a Relation of his of You see Sir  Charles  I have a World of Business cut out and have made you entirely my Confident No foul play do ye hear  Sir Cha  There can be none with a Prince that aims at universal Monarchy But setting Love apart last Night after you left us there came a Fellow into the ChocolateHouse who pretended he had made a Campaign in the Nature of a Voluntier and amongst a number of palpable  Lyes swore at the Battle of  Blenheim  he pursu'd a  French  General over the  Danube  and took him Prisoner on the other side then brought him over upon his Back the Enemies Cannon playing at him all the while The Company laugh'd I confess it rais'd my Spleen and I cou'd not forbear saying That Action was too Glorious in it self to want a Romance to illustrate it  Bel  So I suppose you brought a squabble upon your Hands  Sir Cha  No he swore look'd big bluster'd and walk'd off  Enter  Robin  and a Porter  Robin  Sir  Charles  here's a Porter with a Letter  Port  Sir a Gentleman that saw you come in here bid me give you this  Sir Cha  Peruses the Letter  Very well I'll come to him Ha ha ha  Exit Porter  Bel  Him what 'tis not a Challenge I hope I must go with you  Sir Cha  Suppose it true 'tis not fair to carry a second when the Inviter names none But 'tis no such thing Adieu  Exit Sir  Charles  Bel  If this shou'd be a Duel nowI cou'd never forgive my self for letting him go alone especially if he comes to any harm  Robin  Why suppose he should be kill'd Sir  Bel  Rascal I had rather suppose you hang'd Sir  Robin  A sudden Death prevents a great deal of Vexation Sir sometimes  Bel  How do you make that out  Robin  Why when a Man takes his sick Bed the sad Formalitics that attend it are more dreadful than Death it self His Friends and Relations all weeping round his  Bed a Lawyer brib'd by his Spouse to urge the Will That made the Sorrow is finish'd each then enquire after their Legacy And the disconsolate Wife having borrowed a Weed of her Neighbour is consulting her Glass to see how it becomes her Her Thoughts are where to find another Husband the Servants Heads full of their Mourning So that if the dying Man calls for a Cordial slap they give him a BolousHe desires to be rais'dThey pull away the Pillow  Bel  Ha ha  Robin  The Doctor whose Prescription has poison'd him orders a double Dose of Opium to smooth his Passage to the other World takes his two Guineas Fee throws himself into his Chariot and bids his Coachman drive on to the next Patient Now Sir a Builet or an Oilethole in the Guts prevents all this  Bel  You must preach this when we are raising Recruits Sirrah Ha ha But I must to the Park to meet

jealous Husband whom I married by my Friends Command when I had given my Heart and Vows to another he begg'd for one kind parting Hour which I in pity granted But Oh the illfated Moment brought both my Husband and my Father to be Spectators of our Meeting they call'd for help to seize him but he leapt the Balcony and in the Bustle I escaped with my Woman but know not whither  Toy  Bless me what a Story has she patch'd up  Bell  Fear not Madam I'll defend you against all the Fathers and Husbands in  Christendom  Rob  And I will take your Ladiship's Woman into my Protection  Bel  If your Face answers your Shape and Mien I cannot blame your Husband's Fears Convince me Madam  Isab  After what I have told you if you are generous you will not ask to see my Face Give me but Sanctuary here till Night shall favour my escape to a Friend's House  Bell  Command it Madam  Robin  a Curse of Fortune to send me a Collation at home when I'm engag'd abroad But I must not disappoint  Lucinda  Madam Business of the last Consequence calls me out but my return shall be sudden Can I serve you by enquiring if the Storm be over  Isab  By no means enquiry wou'd ruin me At your return perhaps I may inform you more  Bel  Humph that was kindly insinuated  Robin  give Orders that no Person be admitted into my Lodgings in my absence Madam your most humble  Exit  Toy  Well Madam what's your next Project The Gentleman shew'd but little Curiosity 'Tis certainly an Assignation that hurried him henceOr he had been more pressing to have seen your Face and if he had he wou'd infallibly have remember'd you and then your Plot wou'd have been spoil'd  Isab  'Tis impossible For having had the SmallPox since I am perswaded he will not know me He says he will return instantly in the mean time I'll view his Lodgings  Toy  To what end will you stay 'Tis ten to one if he comes back these six Hours  Isab  No matter I resolve to finish what I once begin I'll  Pursue his Steps and trace 'em with such Art  Discover all the Secrets of his Heart  The Petty Tyrants by my Plots dethrone  And there erect an Empire of my own  The End of the First ACT  ACT II  SCENE the  Park  Enter  Lucinda  and  Betty  Luc  WHAT shou'd be the reason of  Belvill  's stay  Betty  I wish I had not sent to him I'm very uneasie How calm my Hours were before I knew this Man  Betty  I thought Platonick Love never disturb'd the Mind Madam  Luc  Yes when the Friendship is nice and particular  Betty  Nay nay I never knew Friendship in different Sexes but came to particulars at last See here he is  Enter  Belvill  and  Robin  Bel  So the bright  Cyprian  Goddess moves  When loose and in her Chariot drawn by Doves  She rides to meet the Warlike God she loves  Embraces her  Luc  Hey what Lady have you lavish'd your Wit upon this Morning that you are forc'd to Trade upon other Mens Stocks  Bel  Hang these Poetical Rogues they publish every pretty Thought that a Gentleman's forc'd to borrow to express his own Notions  Luc  Pray how do ye apply the last Line  Belvill  To meet the warlike God she loves  You may be vain enough to think your self a  Mars    But when did I betray the Weakness of a  Venus  Bel  S'life Madam I ask your Pardon this villainous Love is got into my Heart and dictates so fast to my Tongue I had quite forgot your Platonicks  Luc  And our Articles last Night too I suppose  Bel  Ah the Study's as crabbed as the LawAnd the Practice as unpleasant as Pennance  Imprimis  that I must take Pains to make the World understand our Conversation is only Friendship and tho' no Body will
