INTRODUCTION  BEGGAR    PLAYER  Beggar  IF Poverty be a Title to Poetry I am sure Nobody can dispute mine I own my self of the Company of Beggars and I make one at their weekly Festivals at St  Giles  's I have a small yearly Sallery for my Catches and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please which is more than most Poets can say  Player  As we live by the Muses 'tis but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit whereever we find it The Muses contrary to all other Ladies pay no Distinction to Drels and never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery for Wit nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness Be the Author who he will we push his Play as far as it will go So though you are in Want I wish you Success heartily  Beggar  This Piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of  James Chariter  and  Moll Lay  two most excellent BalladSingers I have introduc'd the Similes that are in all your celebrated  Operas  The  Swallow  the  Moth  the  Bee  the  Ship  the  Flower  c Besides I have a Prison Scene which the Ladies reckon charmingly pathetick As to the Parts I have observ'd such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies that it is impossible for either of them to take Offence I hope I may be forgiven that I have not made my Opera throughout unnatural like those in vogue for I have no Recitative Excepting this as I have consented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue it must be allow'd an Opera in all its Forms The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by our selves in our great Room at St  Giles  's so that I cannot too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage  Player  But I see 'tis time for us to withdraw the Actors are preparing to begin Play away the Overture  Exeunt  The BEGGAR's Opera  ACT I  SCENE I  SCENE  Peachum  's House  Peachum  sitting at a Table with a large Book of Accounts before him  AIR I An old Woman cloathed in Gray  c  THROUGH all the Employments of Life  Each Neighbour abuses his Brother  Whore and Rogue they call Husband and Wife  All Professions berogue one another  The Priest calls the Lawye a Cheat  The Lawyer bekaaves the Divine  And the Statesman because he's so great  Thinks his Trade as honest as mine  A Lawyer is an honest Employment so is mine Like me too he acts in a double Capacity both against Rogues and for 'em for 'tis but fitting that we should protect and encourage Cheats since we live by them  SCENE II  Peachum    Filch  Filch  Sir Black  Moll  hath sent word her Tryal comes on in the Afternoon and she hopes you will order Matters so as to bring her off  Peach  Why she may plead her Belly at worst to my Knowledge she hath taken care of that Security But as the Wench is very active and industrious you may satisfy her that I'll soften the Evidence  Filch  Tom Gagg  Sir is found guilty  Peach  A lazy Dog When I took him the time before I told him what he would come to if he did not mend his Hand This is Death without Reprieve I may venture to Book him  writes  For  Tom Gagg  forty Pounds Let  Betty Sly  know that I'll save her from Transportation for I can get more by her staying in  England  Filch  Betty  hath brought more Goods into our Lock toyear than any five of the Gang and in truth 'tis a pity to lose so good a Customer  Peach  If none of the Gang take her off she may in the common course of Business live a Twelvemonth longer I love to let Women scape A good Sportsman always lets the Hen Partridges fly because the breed of the Game depends upon them Besides here the Law allows us no Reward there is nothing to be got by the Death of Womenexcept our Wives  Filch  Without dispute she is a fine Woman 'Twas to her I was oblig'd for my Education and to say a bold Word she hath train'd up more young Fellows to the Business than the Gamingtable  Peach  Truly  Filch  thy Observation is right We and the Surgeons are more beholden to Women than all the Professions besides  AIR II The bonny greyey'd Morn  c  Filch  'Tis Woman that seduces all Mankind  By her we first were taught the wheedling Arts  Her very Eyes can cheat when most she's kind  She tricks us of our Money with our Hearts  For her like Wolves by night we roam for Prey  And practise ev'ry Fraud to bribe her Charms  For Suits of Love like Law are won by Pay  And Beauty must be fee'd into our Arms  Peach  But make haste to  Newgate  Boy and let my Friends know what I intend for I love to make them easy one way or other  Filch  When a Gentleman is long kept in suspence Penitence may break his Spirit ever after Besides Certainty gives a Man a good Air upon his Tryal and makes him risque another without Fear or Scruple But I'll away for 'tis a Pleasure to be the Messenger of Comfort to Friends in Affliction  SCENE III  Peachum  But 'tis now high time to look about me for a decent Execution against next Sessions I hate a lazy Rogue by whom one can get nothing 'till he is hang'd A Register of the Gang  reading  Crookfinger'd  Jack  A Year and a half in the Service Let me see how much the Stock owes to his Industry one two three four five Gold Watches and seven Silver ones A mighty cleanhanded Fellow Sixteen Snuff boxes five of them of true Gold Six dozen of Handkerchiefs four silverhilted Swords half a dozen of Shirts three TyePeriwigs and a Piece of Broad Cloath Considering these are only the Fruits of  his leisure Hours I don't know a prettier Fellow for no Man alive hath a more engaging Presence of Mind upon the Road  Wat Dreary  alias  Brown Will  an irregular Dog who hath an underhand way of disposing of his Goods I'll try him only for a Sessions or two longer upon his good Behaviour  Harry Padington  a poor pettylarceny Rascal without the least Genius that Fellow though he were to live these six Months will never come to the Gallows with any Credit Slippery  Sam  he goes off the next Sessions for the Villain hath the Impudence to have views of following his Trade as a Taylor which he calls an honest Employment  Mat  of the  Miat  listed not above a Month ago a promising sturdy Fellow and diligent in his way somewhat too bold and hasty and may raise good Contributions on the Publick if he does not cut himself short by Murder  Tom Tipple  a guzzling soaking Sot who is always too drunk to stand himself or to make others stand A Cart is absolutely necessary for him  Robin  of  Bagshot  alias  Gorgon  alias  Bluff Bob  alias  Carbuncle  alias  Bob Booty  SCENE IV  Peachum  Mrs  Peachum  Mrs  Peach  What of  Bob Booty  Husband I hope nothing bad hath betided him You know my Dear he's a favourite Customer of mine 'Twas he made me a Present of this Ring  Peach  I have set his Name down in the blackList that's all my Dear he spends his Life among Women and as soon as his Money is gone one or other of the Ladies will hang him for the Reward and there's forty Pound lost to us for ever  Mrs  Peach  You know my Dear I never meddle in matters of Death I always leave those Affairs to you Women indeed are bitter bad Judges in these cases for they are so partial to the Brave that they think every Man handsome who is going to the Camp or the Gallows  AIR III Cold and Raw  c  If any Wench  Venus  's Girdle wear  Though she be never so ugly  Lillies and Roses will quickly appear  And her Face look wond'rous smuggly  Beneath the left Ear so fit but a Cord  A Rope so charming a Zone is  The Youth in his Cart hath the Air of a Lord  And we cry There  es an  Adonis    But really Husband you should not be too hardhearted for you never had a finer braver set of Men than at present We have not had a Murder among them all these seven Months And truly my Dear that is a great Blessing  Peach  What a dickens is the Woman always a whimpring about Murder for No Gentleman is ever look'd upon the worse for killing a Man in his own Defence and if Business cannot be carried on without it what would you have a Gentleman do  Mrs  Peach  If I am in the wrong my Dear you must excuse me for Nobody can help the Frailty of an overscrupulous Conscience  Peach  Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man can be guilty of How many fine Gentlemen have we in  Newgate  every Year purely upon that Article If they have wherewithal to persuade the Jury to bring it in Manslaughter what are they the worse for it So my Dear have done upon this Subject Was Captain  Macheath  here this Morning for the banknotes he left with you last Week  Mrs  Peach  Yes my Dear and though the Bank hath stopt Payment he was so cheerful and so agreeable Sure there is not a finer Gentleman upon the Road than the Captain If he comes from  Bagshot  at any reasonable Hour he hath promis'd to make one this  and me  and  Bob Booty  at a Party of Quadrille Pray my Dear is the Captain rich  Peach  The Captain keeps too good Company ever to grow rich  Marybone  and the Chocolatehouses are his undoing The Man that proposes to get Money by Play should have the Education of a fine Gentleman and be train'd up to it from his Youth  Mrs  Peach  Really I am sorry upon  Polly  's Account the Captain in hath not more Discretion What business hath he to keep Company with Lords and Gentlemen he should leave them to prey upon one another  Peach  Upon  Polly  's Account What a Plague does the Woman meanUpon  Polly  's Account  Mrs  Peach  Captain  Macheath  is very fond of the Girl  Peach  And what then  Mrs  Peach  If I have any Skill in the Ways of Women I am sure  Polly  thinks him a very pretty Man  Peach  And what then You would not be so mad to have the Wench marry him Gamesters and Highway men are generally very good to their Whores but they are very Devils to their Wives  Mrs  Peach  But if  Polly  should be in love how should we help her or how can she help herself Poor Girl I am in the utmost Concern about her  AIR IV Why is your faithful Slave disdain'd  c  If Love the Virgin's Heart invade  How like a Moth the simple Maid  Still plays about the Flame  If soon she be not made a Wife  Her Honour's sign'd and then for Life  She'swhat I dare not name  Peach  Look ye Wife A handsome Wench in our way of Business is as profitable as the Bar of a  Temple  CoffeeHouse who looks upon it as her livelihood to grant every Liberty but one You see I would indulge the Girl  as far as prudently we can In any thing but Marriage After that my Dear how shall we be safe Are we not then in her Husband's Power For a Husband hath the absolute Power over alla Wife's Secrets but her own If the Girl had the Discretion of a Court Lady who can have a dozen young Fellows at her Ear without complying with one I should not matter it but  Polly  is Tinder and a Spark will at once set her on a Flame Married If the Wench does not know her own Profit sure she knows her own Pleasure better than to make herself a Property My Daughter to me should be like a Court Lady to a Minister of State a Key to the whole Gang Married If the Affair is not already done I'll terrify her from it by the Example of our Neighbours  Mrs  Peach  Mayhap my Dear you may injure the Girl She loves to imitate the fine Ladies and she may only allow the Captain Liberties in the View of Interest  Peach  But 'tis your Duty my Dear to warn the Girl against her Ruin and to instruct her how to make the most of her Beauty I'll go to her this Moment and sift her In the mean time Wife rip out the Coronets and Marks of these dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs for I can dispose of them this Afternoon to a Chap in the City  SCENE V  Mrs  Peachum  Never was a Man more out of the way in an Argument than my Husband Why must our  Polly  forsooth differ from her Sex and love only her Husband And why must  Polly  's Marriage contrary to all Observation make her the less followed by other Men All Men are Thieves in Love and like a Woman the better for being another's Property  AIR V Of all the simple Things we do  c  A Maid is like the golden Oar  Which hath Guineas intrinsical in't  Whose Worth is never known before  It is try'd and imprest in the Mint  A Wife's like a Guinea in Gold  Stampt with the Name of her Spouse  Now here now there is bought or is sold  And is current in every House  SCENE VI  Mrs  Peachum    Filch  Mrs  Peach  Come hither  Filch  I am as fond of this Child as though my Mind misgive me he were my own He hath as fine a Hand at picking a Pocket as a Woman and is as nimblefinger'd as a Juggler If any unlucky Session does not cut the Rope of thy Life I pronounce Boy thou wilt be a great Man in History Where was your Post last Night my Boy  Filch  I play'd at the Opera Madam and considering 'twas neither dark nor rainyâª so that there was no great Hurry in getting Chairs and Coachesâª made a tolerable hand on't There seven Handkerchiets Madam  Mrs  Peach  Colour'd ones I see They are of sure  from our Warehouse at  Redriff  among the Seamen  Filch  And this Snuffbox  Mrs  Peach  Set in Gold A pretty Encouragement this to a young Beginner  Filch  I had a rare tug at a charming Gold Watch Pox take the Taylors for making the Fobs so deep and narrow It stuck by the way and I was forc'd to make my Escape under a Coach Really Madam I fear I shall be cut off in the Flower of my Youth so that every now and then since I was pumpt I have thoughts of taking up and going to Sea  Mrs  Peach  You should go to  Hockley in the Hole  and to  Marybone  Child to learn Valour These are the Schools that have bred so many brave Men I thought Boy by this time thou hadst lost Fear as well as Shame Poor Lad how little does he know as yet of the  OldBarly  For the first Fact I'll insure thee from being hang'd and going to Sea  Filch    come time enough upon a Sentence of  Transportation But now since you have nothing better to do ev'n go to your Book and learn your Catechism for really a Man makes but an ill Figure in the Ordinary's Paper who cannot give a satisfactory Answer to his Questions But hark you my Lad don't tell me a Lye for you know I hate a Lyar Do you know of any thing that hath past between Captain  Macheath  and our  Polly    Filch  I beg you Madam don't ask me for I must either tell a Lye to you or to Miss  Polly  for I promis'd her I would not tell  Mrs  Peach  But when the Honour of our Family is concern'd  Filch  I shall lead a sad Life with Miss  Polly  if ever she come to know that I told you Besides I would not willingly forefeit my own Honour by betraying any body  Mrs  Peach  Yonder comes my Husband and  Polly  Come  Filch  you shall go with me into my own Room and tell me the whole Story I'll give thee a most delicious Glass of Cordial that I keep for my own drinking  SCENE VII  Peachum    Polly  Polly  I know as well as any of the fine Ladies how to make the most of my self and of my Man too A Woman knows how to be mercenary though she hath never been in a Court or at an Assembly We have it in our Natures Papa If I allow Captain  Macheath  some trifling Liberties I have this Watch and other visible Marks of his Favour to show for it A Girl who cannot grant some Things and refuse what is most material will make but a poor hand of her Beauty and soon be thrown upon the Common  AIR VI What shall I do to show how much I love her  c  Virgins are like the fair Flower in its Lustre  Which in the Garden enamels the Ground  Near it the Bees in play flutter and cluster  And gaudy Butterflies frolick around  But when once pluck'd 'tis no longer alluring  To  CoventGarden  'tis sent as yet sweet  There fades and shrinks and grows past all enduring  Rots stinks and dies and is trod under feet  Peach  You know  Polly  I am not against your toying and trifling with a Customer in the way of Business or to get out a Secret or so But if I found out that you have play'd the fool and are married you Jade you I'll cut your Throat Hussy Now you know my Mind  SCENE VIII  Peachum    Polly  Mrs  Peachum  AIR VII Oh  London  is a fine Town  Mrs  Peachum  in a very great Passion  Our  Polly  is a sad Slut nor heeds what we taught her  I wonder any Man alive will ever rear a Daughter  For she must have both Hoods and Gowns and Hoops to swell her Pride  With Scarfs and Stays and Gloves and Lace and she will have Men beside  And when she's drest with Care and Cost alltempting fine and gay  As Men should serve a Cowcumber she flings herself away  Our  Polly  is a sad Slut c  You Baggage you Hussy you inconsiderate Jade had you been hang'd it would not have vex'd me for that might have been your Misfortune but to do such a mad thing by Choice The Wench is married Husband  Peach  Married The Captain is a bold Man and will risque any thing for Money to be sure he believes her a Fortune Do you think your Mother and I should have liv'd comfortably so long together if ever we had been married Baggage  Mrs  Peach  I knew she was always a proud Slut and now the Wench hath play'd the Fool and married because forsooth she would do like the Gentry Can you support the Expence of a Husband Hussy in gaming drinking and whoring have you Money enough to carry on the daily Quarrels of Man and Wife about who shall squander most There are not many Husbands and Wives who can bear the Charges of plaguing one another in a handsome way If you must be married could you introduce nobody into our Family but a Highwayman Why thou foolish Jade thou wilt be as illus'd and as much neglected as if thou hadst married a Lord  Peach  Let not your Anger my Dear break through the Rules of Decency for the Captain looks upon himself in the Military Capacity as a Gentleman by his Profession Besides what he hath already I know he is in a fair way of getting or of dying and both these ways let me tell you are most excellent Chances for a Wife Tell me Hussy are you ruin'd or no  Mrs  Peach  With  Polly  's Fortune she might very well have gone off to a Person of Distinction Yes that you might you pouting Slut  Peach  What is the Wench dumb Speak or I'll make you plead by squeezing out an Answer from you Are you really bound Wife to him or are you only upon liking  Pinches her  Polly  Oh  Screaming  Mrs  Peach  How the Mother is to be pitied who hath handsome Daughters Locks Bolts Bars and Lectures of Morality are nothing to them They break through them all They have as much Pleasure in cheating a Father and Mother as in cheating at Cards  Peach  Why  Polly  I shall soon know if you are married by  Macheath  's keeping from our House  AIR VIII Grim King of the Ghosts  c  Polly  Can Love be controul'd by Advice  Will  Cupid  our Mothers obey  Though my Heart were were as frozen as Ice  At his Flame 'twould have melted away  When he kist me so closely he prest  'Twas so sweet that I must have comply'd  So I thought it both safest and best  To marry for fear you should chide  Mrs  Peach  Then all the Hopes of our Family are gone for ever and ever  Peach  And  Macheath  may hang his Father and MotherinLaw in hope to get into their Daughter's Fortune  Polly  I did not marry him as 'tis the Fashion cooly and deliberately for Honour or Money But I love him  Mrs  Peach  Love him worse and worse I thought the Girl had been better bred Oh Husband Husband her Folly makes me mad my Head swims I'm distracted I can't support myselfOh  Faints  Peach  Lee Wench to what a Condition you have reduc'd your poor Mother a Glass of Cordial this instant How the poor Woman takes it to Heart    Polly  goes out and returns with it  Ah Hussy now this the only Comfort your Mother has left  Polly  Give her another Glass Sir my Mama drinks double the Quantity whenever she is out of Order This you see fetches her  Mrs  Peach  The Girl shows such a Readiness and so much Concern that I could almost find in my Heart to forgive her  AIR IX O  Jenny  O  Jenny  where hast thou been  O  Polly  you might have toy'd and kist  By keeping Man off you keep them on  Polly  But he so teaz'd me  And he so pleas'd me  What I did you must have done  Mrs  Peach  Not with a HighwaymanYou sorry Slut  Peach  A Word with you Wife 'Tis no new thing for a Wench to take Man without consent of Parents You know 'tis the Frailty of Woman my Dear  Mrs  Peach  Yes indeed the Sex is frail But the first time a Woman is frail she should be somewhat nice methinks for then or never is the time to make her Fortune After that she hath nothing to do but to guard herself from being found out and she may do what she pleases  Peach  Make your self a little easy I have a Thought shall soon set all Matters again to rights Why so melancholy  Polly  since what is done cannot be undone we must all endeavour to make the best of it  Mrs  Peach  Well  Polly  as far as one Woman can forgive another I forgive theeYour Father is too fond of you Hussy  Polly  Then all my Sorrows are at an end  Mrs  Peach  A mighty likely Speech in troth for a Wench who is just married  AIR X  Thomas  I cannot  c  Polly  I like a Ship in Storms was tost  Yet afraid to put in to Land  For seiz'd in the Port the Vessel's lost  Whose Treasure is counterband  The Waves are laid  My Duty's paid  O Joy beyond Expression  Thus safe ashore  I ask no more  My allis in my Possession  Peach  I hear Customers in a'other Room Go talk with 'em  Polly  but come to us again as soon as they are goneBut heark ye Child if 'tis the Gentleman who was here Yesterday about the RepeatingWatch say you believe we can't get Intelligence of it till tomorrow For I lent it to  Suly Straddlo  to make a Figure with it tonight at a Tavern in  DruryLane  If t'other Gentleman calls for the Silverhilted Sword you know Beetlebrow'd  Jemmy  hath it on and he doth not come from  Tunbridge  till  Tuesday  Night so that it cannot be had till then  SCENE IX  Peachum  Mrs  Peachum  Peach  Dear Wife be a little pacified Don't let your Passion run away with your Senses  Polly  I grant you hath done a rash thing  Mrs  Peach  If she had had only an Intrigue with the Fellow why the very best Families have excus'd and huddled up a Frailty of that sort 'Tis Marriage Husband that makes it a Blemish  Peach  But Money Wife is the true Fuller's Earth for Reputations there is not a Spot or a Stain but what it can take out A rich Rogue nowadays is fit Company for any Gentleman and the World my Dear hath not such a Contempt for Roguery as you imagine I tell you Wife I can make this Match turn to our Advantage  Mrs  Peach  I am very sensible Husband that Captain  Macheath  is worth Money but I am in doubt whether he hath not two or three Wives already and then if he should dye in a Session or two  Polly  's Dower would come into Dispute  Peach  That indeed is a Point which ought to be consider'd  AIR XI A Soldier and a Sailor  A Fox may steal your Hens Sir  A Whore your Health and Pence Sir  Your Daughter rob your Chest Sir  Your Wife may steal your Rest Sir  A Thief your Goods and Plate  But this is all but picking  With Rest Pence Chest and Chicken  It ever was decreed Sir  If Lawyer's Hand is fee'd Sir  He steals your whole Estate  The Lawyers are bitter Enemies to those in our Way They don't care that any Body should get a Clandestine Livelihood but themselves  SCENE X  Mrs  Peachum    Peachum    Polly  Polly  'Twas only Nimming  Ned  He brought in a Damask WindowCurtain a HoopPetticoat a Pair of Silver Candlesticks a Periwig and one Silk Stocking from the Fire that happen'd last Night  Peach  There is not a Fellow that is cleverer in his way and saves more Goods out of the Fire than  Ned  But now  Polly  to your Affair for Matters must not be left as they are You are married then it seems  Polly  Yes Sir  Peach  And how do you propose to live Child  Polly  Like other Women Sir upon the Industry of my Husband  Mrs  Peach  What is the Wench turn'd Fool A Highwayman's Wife like a Soldier's hath as little of his Pay as of his Company  Peach  And had not you the common Views of a Gentlewoman in your Marriage  Polly    Polly  I don't know what you mean Sir  Peach  Of a Jointure and of being a Widow  Polly  But I love him Sir how then could I have Thoughts of parting with him  Peach  Parting with him Why that is the whole Scheme and Intention of all Marriage Articles The comfortable  Estate of Widowhood is the only Hope that keeps up a Wife's Spirits Where is the Woman who would scruple to be a Wife if she had it in her Power to be a Widow whenever she pleas'd If you have any Views of this sort  Polly  I shall think the Match not so very unseasonable  Polly  How I dread to hear your Advice Yet I must beg you to explain yourself  Peach  Secure what he hath got have him peach'd the next Sessions and then at once you are made a rich Widow  Polly  What murder the Man I love The Blood runs cold at my Heart with the very Thought of it  Peach  Fye  Polly  What hath Murder to do in the Affair Since the thing sooner or later must happen I dare say the Captain himself would like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a Stranger Why  Polly  the Captain knows that as 'tis his Employment to rob so 'tis ours to take Robbers every Man in his Business So that there is no Malice in the Case  Mrs  Peach  Ay Husband now you have nick'd the Matter To have him peach'd is the only thing could ever make me forgive her  AIR XII Now ponder well ye Parents dear  Polly  Oh ponder well be not severe  So save a wretched Wife  For on the Rope that hangs my Dear  Depends poor  Polly  's Life  Mrs  Peach  But your Duty to your Parents Hussy obliges you to hang him What would many a Wife give for such an Opportunity  Polly  What is a Jointure what is Widowhood to me I know my Heart I cannot survive him  AIR XIII Le printemps rapelle aux armes  The Turtle thus with plaintive crying  Her Lover dying  The Turtle thus with plaintive crying  Laments her Dove  Down she drops quite spent with sighing  Pair'd in Death as pair'd in Love  Thus Sir it will happen to your poor  Polly  Mrs  Peach  What is the Fool in love in earnest then I hate thee for being particular Why Wench thou art a Shame to thy very Sex  Polly  But hear me MotherIf you ever lov'd  Mrs  Peach  Those cursed Playbooks she reads have been her Ruin One Word more Hussy and I shall knock your Brains out if you have any  Peach  Keep out of the way  Polly  for fear of Mischief and consider of what is propos'd to you  Mrs  Peach  Away Hussy Hang your Husband and be dutiful  SCENE XI  Mrs  Peachum    Peachum    Polly  listning  Mrs  Peach  The Thing Husband must and shall be done For the sake of Intelligence we must take other Measures and have him peach'd the next Session without her Consent If she will not know her Duty we know ours  Peach  But really my Dear it grieves one's Heart to take off a great Man When I consider his personal Bravery his fine Stratagem how much we have already got by him and how much more we may get methinks I can't find in my Heart to have a Hand in his Death I wish you could have made  Polly  undertake it  Mrs  Peach  But in a Case of Necessityour own Lives are in danger  Peach  Then indeed we must comply with the Customs of the World and make Gratitude give way to InterestHe shall be taken off  Mrs  Peach  I'll undertake to manage  Polly  Peach  And I'll prepare Matters for the  OldBailv  SCENE XII  Polly  Now I'm a Wretch indeedMethinks I see him already in the Cart sweeter and more lovely than the Nosegay in his HandI hear the Crowd extolling his Resolution and IntrepidityWhat Vollies of Sighs are sent from the Windows of  Holborn  that so comely a Youth should be brought to DisgraceI see him at the Tree The whole Circle are in Tearseven Butchers weep  Jack Ketch  himself hesitates to perform his Duty and would be glad to lose his Fee by a Reprieve What then will become of  Polly  As yet I may inform him of their Design and aid him in his EscapeIt shall be soBut then he flies absents himself and I bar my self from his dear dear Conversation That too will distract meIf he keep out of the way my Papa and Mama may in time relent and we may be happyIf he stays he is hang'd and then he is lost foreverHe intended to lye conceal'd in my Room 'till the Dusk of the Evening If they are abroad I'll this Instant let him out lest some Accident should prevent him  Exit and returns  SCENE XIII  Polly    Macheath  AIR XIV Pretty Parrot say  Mach  Pretty  Polly  say  When I was away  Did your Fancy never stray  To some newer Lover  Polly  Without Disguise  Heaving Sighs  Doating Eyes  My constant Heart discover  Fondly let me loll  Mach  O pretty pretty  Poll  Polly  And are  you  as fond as ever my Dear  Mach  Suspect my Honour my Courage suspect any thing but my LoveMay my Pistols miss Fire and my Mare slip her Shoulder while I am pursu'd if I ever forsake thee  Polly  Nay my Dear I have no Reason to doubt you for I find in the Romance you lent

ev'ry Hour  But here ev'ry Flower is united  Polly  Were you sentenc'd to Transportation sure my Dear you could not leave me behind youcould you  Mach  Is there any Power any Force that could tear me from thee You might sooner tear a Pension out of the Hands of a Courtier a Fee from a Lawyer a pretty Woman from a Lookingglass or any Woman from  Quadrille  But to tear me from thee is impossible  AIR VI Over the Hills and far away  Were I laid on  Greenland  's Coast  And in my Arms embrac'd my Lass  Warm amidst eternal Frost  Too soon the Half Year's Night would pass  Polly  Were I sold on  Indian  Soil  Soon as the burning Day was clos'd  I could mock the sultry Toil  When on my Charmer's Breast repos'd  Mach  And I would love you all the Day  Polly  Every Night would kiss and play  Mach  If with me you'd fondly stray  Polly  Over the Hills and far away  Polly  Yes I would go with thee But ohhow shall I speak it I must be torn from thee We must part  Mach  How Part  Polly  We must we mustMy Papa and Mama are set against thy Life They now even now are in Search after thee They are preparing Evidence against thee Thy Life depends upon a Moment  AIR XVII Gin thou wert mine awn thing  O what Pain it is to part  Can I leave thee can I leave thee  O what Pain it is to part  Can thy  Polly  ever leave thee  But lest Death my Love should thwart  And bring thee to the fatal
