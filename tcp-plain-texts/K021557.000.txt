 ARGUMENTS About the ALTERATION of  TRIENNIAL ELECTIONS  OF PARLIAMENT  In a LETTER to a Friend in the Country  SIR  YOUR last Letter expresses your great Concerns and Fears about the Design now on foot for the Alteration of the  Act for the frequent Meeting and Calling of Parliaments  in one Particular that is the Changing the  Term  for  Elections  of  Parliament  from  three  to  more  Years and at the same time gives me an Account of the several  Objections  which make the greatest Noise around you upon that Subject The same  Fears  and the same  Objections  I find to be very common and very warmly propagated in all Conversations here in Town  For my self I acknowledge that it is with  me  in  this  Case as it is in many others of Importance the  first Surprize  gave me the like  Uneasiness  to what you express But I am very well satisfied that the most likely Way to cure that Uneasiness is to debate the Matter as Friends and to examine Whether that  Surprize  be the Force of  meer Prejudice  or of good Judgment And for this I am very sure I am in one Respect at least well qualified That as to my own private Advantage or Interest it is not of the least Importance to me Whether the  Parliament  may with the Consent of the  King  sit  three  Years or  seven  Years or  twenty  Years I have no Designs nor Views no  Piques  nor  Resentments  to incline me one way or other And therefore if you will put your self into the same  Posture  of Mind we will if you please enter upon this Subject  In all  Debates  of this Nature there are  Two  principal Points which will comprehend under them all other Particulars The  One  is Whether the Thing proposed be  lawful  with regard to the Nature of our Constitution The  Other  is Whether it be  expedient  or  useful  to the Good Ends which ought always to be in the View of those who make Laws  The  Lawfulness  of the Thing can't be denied by any Persons tho' never so great Enemies to the doing it Nor do I find amongst all the  Topicks  employed against it that any thing of Moment is  against the Right or Authority of the  Legislature  to do it It is no more  a Fundamental  of our  Constitution  That a  New Parliament  must be summon'd every  three Years  than at any other Interval It is equally just as far as  Right  and  Authority  are concern'd for the  King Lords  and  Commons  to six it for  one  Term as for  another  And if it were not out of their  Right  to make that  Great Alteration  which fix'd it for  three  Years it certainly cannot be out of their  Right  to make a much less  Alteration  by fixing it once more to another Term  As to the Sense and Mind of the Electors the Truth of the Matter is this They are suppos'd to have no other View in their Choice of Persons than to send such to Parliament as they think best qualified by their Estates Wisdom and Integrity to do whatever is to be done in Parliament without regard to the Time of their Sitting there And there is no other End in the electing Representatives but that they from Time to Time may make and alter Laws in such manner as best to consult and promote the Good of the whole Community The very Election is and must be supposed to impower the Elected Persons faithfully and impartially to do every Thing that is necessary or expedient for the Preservation and Establishment of the Common Interest whether it falls in with the Humours or Opinions of the Electors or not This brings us to the only Point to be consider'd when any  Alteration  of a former  Changeable Law  is proposed and that is Whether all Things consider'd it be  Expedient  and  Useful  And of this as far as the Time past is concern'd  Experience  is the best Judge When a  Law  hath been long tried and the  Consequences  and  Effects  of it in a Nation have been many Years open and sensible it requires but little Thought to judge whether it be best to continue it in every Respect as it is or to model it anew And now if you please we will consider the  Effect  the  Triennial Elections  have had amongst our selves at  Home  and then it will be proper to think of the  Effect  they have had and still must naturally have  Abroad  At  Home  the least Evil is that the  Tempers  and  Spirits  of Men are put into a  Fermen    and boil'd up into a  Rage  which never is cooled because the Returns at which this  Rage  is useful to some Persons or other are so  quick  that it is not  Politick  in such Men to  let  it cease nor perhaps possible for them to  make  it cease even if they were willing to do so  Riots Tumults Mutual Abuses odious NickNames Personal Affronts  are kept alive and warm from  Three  Year to  Three  Year by Men of Design and Dexterity in the Management of other Men's  Passions  improved and heighten'd by such  quick Returns  These are what we see and feel of the  Effects  of it upon the Temper of a Nation that if ever it is ruined can be ruined by nothing but its divided Affections and Interests  Besides this there could not be contrived a Method more effectual to the Debauchery of the Subject's  Morals  not only in  one  but in  all  Respects than  this  hath proved  Bribery  known and open without a Remedy which supposeth a Corruption of Mind and naturally leads to an Insensibility to every thing Great and Honourable and by Degrees to a perfect Disregard to every thing Sacred and Useful A Scene of Bestial Intemperance encouraged and paid for in many Places for fear  Friendship  should cool if it be not kept hot by such MethodsAnd the Crimes that often accompany  this  need not be mentioned The least is a General Disposition in Men to leave the Thoughts of Diligence and Industry in their Business for the more agreeable Entertainments of Idleness and a luxurious Beggary  I do not suppose or argue that this  Alteration  of the  Term  will put a full Stop to this Corruption of  Morals  either as to  Bribery  or to the other Instances named But it is certain that the Returns being not so quick the Tempers of Men must in the Nature of Things become much more easy to one another by Degrees which is itself an Advantage greatly to be valued It is certain that the  Scent  of  Bribery  cannot be so strong nor the Avowal of it so constant when there is such an Intermission And as for that neverceasing Current of  Debauchery  requisite for so frequent Elections it must be this way interrupted and in a good Degree broken into The Crimes often accompanying it must diminish And the  Men  brought up to laborious Callings must exchange their  Idleness  for Industry and become much more useful to their Families and the  Publick  I mention not the Ruin both of the Estates and Morals of  Gentlemen  so frequently  Candidates  at our Elections They know best how well they can bear such Evils and whether it tends to make themselves better  Patriots  to their Country or better Fathers to their own Families that they are to make their Way by so quick Returns of  Bribery  and  Corruption  We have hitherto considered the ill Effect of these evil Consequences at home supposing them to terminate in the Concerns of  Private  Men But this Supposition is not to be continued For you will see presently that all these Things have a visible Influence upon the  Publick  The General  Topick  amongst the Adversaries of this  Alteration  as well  those  who  hate  as those who  love Liberty  truly so called is the  seeming  Advantage of this Part of the  Act  to that great and lovely Good I call it  seeming  because as it never was designed at first by many of the most zealous Promoters of it for any thing but to  cramp  the Endeavours of a  Good Prince  for the settling our  Liberties  So it hath never had any better lasting Effect that Way than they design'd it should have but as I think visibly tends in its Consequences to the Destruction of our legal Liberties The Reason is short and plain Nothing in the World can make Men more supinely negligent of the Publick Interest or dispose them more to receive their Chains than a State of  Bribery Corruption Debauchery  and  Idleness  And this is the constant State of most of our  Electors  meerly thro' the quick Returns and the pleasing Prospect of  Elections  The more lasting and uninterrupted this  State  is the less sensible are they of the  Evils  it inclines them to They are by degrees brought to think the  highest Bidder  to have the best Right to their  Votes  And will act in Time agreeably to that Thought whether the  Money  be offer'd them from Abroad or at Home The little Interruption to their Vices and their Expectations is the Thing which makes the Danger so great And this is owing to the frequent Returns of  Elections  at so short certain Periods of Time  Nor doth this Argument touch the  Electors  only but the  Elected  also to a very great degree For as long as Humane Nature is capable of  Corruption  as long as there is a  Probability  or even a  Possibility  of any Part of Mankind being induced to sell their Country and their Posterity for a present Advantage to themselves so long it is evident to a Demonstration that  Gentlemen  who have by so frequent Returns of  Chargeable Elections  exhausted their Estate and impoverished their Families will be much more likely to seek or to embrace Opportunities of reimbursing themselves and preventing their own immediate Ruin at the Expence of the publick  Liberty  and  Security  much more likely I say to act this Part than if the  Term  were made longer and if by that Means they might hope to be at rest from Expence for a much longer Time  Add to this that  Personal  and  PartyRevenge  which is of all others the most strong  Principle  in the Bulk of  Men  never fails to actuate both the  Candidates  and the  Electors  If ever our Ruin be effected it is too probable  this  will be the great Engine of it And let every one judge whether any thing could be devised more likely either to raise or actuate or preserve that Spirit in its Keenness and Bitterness than the  Triennial  Returns of  Elections  and the Expectation of them Or whether any thing can give us any  Respite  from that Spirit and its fatal Consequences but an  Alteration  of those  Returns  to a longer Distance  There is another Consideration very well worth mentioning on this Subject which is the Distribution of Justice in the Countries It is manifest that nothing hath diverted the Course of it from its proper  Current  so much as the  PartyViews  of Men kept up to such a Degree by the expected Returns of  frequent Elections  and that nothing can recall it again but some Rest from those Views which turn'd it aside Men will not have  the Temptation and therefore not the Inclination either to suspend Justice or to act contrary to it in many of those Instances in which now their constant Hopes or Fears actuated by the  Frequency  of  Elections  are too apt to draw them aside Besides that when some Intermission is given to the Heats and Quarrels of Neighbours the Occasions and Opportunities of Partiality or Injustice must in good measure cease  The  Effects  which I have now gone over are but too certain as they are the natural Product of the Passions of Men in a divided Nation and they are  Evils  which will be by degrees at least very much abated by the present Design  We have hitherto consider'd our  Triennial Elections  their Influence upon  Us  at  Home  Now let us consider what Effect They have had and still naturally have  Abroad  And here it must be remembred that We are a Nation not separated in Interest as We are in Situation from the rest of  Europe  We have Enemies at Home acting in Concert with Enemies Abroad And  Friends  Abroad without regard to whose Interests and Alliances We must sooner or later become a Sacrifice to those Enemies We have a  Pretender  to guard against Many here are his profess'd Friends and many more act either blindly or designedly with Those who are so bearing a sensible part in their Interests and ever encouraging or at least not discouraging Them That which keeps up the Views of those Abroad who think it their Concern to make us the Scene of  Civil War  if not a  Province  to themselves under that  Pretender That  I say alone which keeps up their Views is the knowing They have  Friends  here and the finding that these Friends are never in despair but always representing their Cause as promising well And that which keeps them in this Temper is the constant Expectation of  New Elections  in which They hope for more but are certain at least of  this  Advantage that our Heats and Hatreds and Desire of Revenge are still perpetuated and improved This is constantly represented abroad and with such Success that They who wish Evil to our Happy Establishment seem really to believe it and they who wish well to it receive Impression enough from it to look upon Us with Diffidence as a  People  always fluctuating and uncertain It was this great disadvantage arising from our Condition at home that brought King  William  to make a  Peace  even against his own good Judgment and his own great Views for which nothing could be urged but that distress to which our wretched and uneasy State here had reduced his Affairs And no wonder now if after that great Unhappiness and what is still more dreadful after a late Fatal Experience the best Friends we have  Abroad  cannot be so confident of us as our Interest makes it requisite they should be In a Word Our  Enemies  both  Abroad  and at  Home  can't be reduc'd even one step towards a state of  Despair  in the Methods We are in at present Nor our best Friends be throughly assured of our secure Estate The  Former  must look upon us still with a good degree of Contempt and the  Latter  with a great deal of Uneasiness and Diffidence till We have some resting Time to Settle not only the  Tempers  but the Affairs and the Interests of this Nation Which never will be done as there is Reason to fear as long as  Parliaments  continue limited to the present Term  This puts me in mind of another very material Point which tho' absolutely necessary to procure Us the Confidence of our Friends and to command Respect from our Enemies yet seems impossible to be Effected without a greater steddiness of Counsels a more uninterrupted Application to publick Business and a more Mature and Disinterested Deliberation than the Experience we have had of frequent  Elections  gives room to hope for This is the Paying off the  Debts  of the  Nation  which must otherwise Eat out the very Vitals of the Publick and expose Us to the greatest Danger from such foreign Powers as are using the most violent Methods to be before hand with Us in this signal Advantage To work out this inveterate Evil there appears but one Method consistent with the Faith of Parliamentary Securities which ought to be preserved inviolable and at the same time free from the Odium of imposing new Taxes on the Country and in which consequently the Landed and the Monied Interest would be likely to join without eithers thinking themselves in the least aggrieved This is to Raise and Support the Publick Credit to such a Height as may enable the Government to Borrow at a  lower  Interest what may Pay off such Debts as carry a  greater  which was attempted last Year but hindred by the Rebellion Now Experience shews that publick Credit will be subject to perpetual Fluctuations and Inequalities or even fall to an Ebb from whence it is next to impossible to make it reascend while the Measures of one three Years are liable to be Unravell'd and Reversed by the Three next succeeding and those again by the next and whilst under the Shelter of frequent Elections such Tumults Commotions and Disorders are Introduced as however opposite in themselves conspire in shaking the Foundation of all Government keep Mens Minds in suspence and make them look on every Thing as precarious that is any ways involved with the Publick  After many  Enquiries  I can meet with but one  Good Event  in favour of the  Triennial Term  for  Elections  which a long Experience hath furnish'd us with And that is that it is suppos'd to have been the occasion of throwing out the Destructive  Bill  of  Commerce  some  Gentlemen  not daring to Vote for it out of fear of their next  Elections  But this you will see cuts both ways For as  Gentlemen  may by accident not do a  Bad  thing for fear of their  Next Election  so it is as plain that they may as often not do the most necessary  good  thing if it happens to be  Unpopular  for the same fear So that this holds at least equally  against  that Bill as  for  it But then many who knew those Times will deny the  Fact  and affirm that a multitude of  little Piques  and  great Passions  concurr'd in that Affair and that the  Awe  of  Electors  happen'd at that time to have but little Share in it Private History would be useful to us upon this occasion But  this  We all saw in  publick  that however that Fear might then be suppos'd to work so far as to hinder those few  Gentlemen  from openly espousing that  fatal Bill  it did not work so far as to keep them immediately from entering into an  Address  and Voting for such  Methods  as must have been as  Fatal  as that Bill it self if Providence had not interposed What would it have avail'd us that the  Bill  had not pass'd  then  if these Designs at the same Time on Foot had prevail'd And what doth it avail to say that the  Triennial Term  did Us that good supposing it so when it is plain it had not the Power to preserve that Good and that the same Persons who seem'd to fear it yet were induc'd to  undo  their own Work and to enter into Measures which must have ended in the same Evils  and indeed in Universal Destruction It signifies little therefore whether this was the great occasion of that  lucky Incident  or not because it is plain it had not power enough to hinder the Ill Effects of that  Bill  in another Method Nor would have hindred them had not something else intervened But supposing it had certainly  that  one particular so purely accidental cannot be set against a  Train  of Constant and too certain Evil Consequences which we feel every Day we live These  Evil Consequences  are so many undeniableArguments for an  Alteration  of it and weigh exceedingly and particularly at this Juncture when all our Happiness depends upon the  Firm Establishment  of our  Excellent King  upon this Throne when all our Enemies at Home and Abroad visibly place their Hopes in our Disturbances owing to nothing so much as to the constant Expectation of  Triennial Elections  when all our true Friends both here and elsewhere wait with Impatience to see our Security firmly and throughly Established When the going on with proper Measures for such Establishment has been unavoidably put off by the Attention given to the Rebellion and so the longer Continuance of this Parliament is become particularly necessary And when We all may observe if We please that tho' the  Rebellion  be in great Measure quell'd yet the  Spirit  of it is so far from being lay'd asleep that it walks about still even at Noonday in defiance of all  Authority  and with a strubborness never to be reduced to a settled Despair without some such  Method  as is now talk'd of  These  Particulars  I say are so many undeniable Arguments for an  Alteration  of the  Term  of  Years  fix'd in the  Act  unless it shall appear that the  Objections  against doing it are of more Weight and Importance Those which I have been able to hear of together with such as you tell me are most talk'd of in the Country We will now just run over  The most general Objection and that which seems in reality to lye at the Bottom of all the rest is that this Step will be so unpopular among the Electors and raise such a Clamour all over the Nation as must for ever sink the Interest of those who have any Share in promoting it To this I answer that it will wholly depend on the Parliament it self to render this proceeding Popular or Unpopular by the right or wrong Use they shall make of the Prolongation thereby accruing to themselves If their Afterbehaviour should be such as to shew they had no wiser nor more generous View in making this Alteration than merely to save themselves the hazard trouble and expence of a New Election they must no doubt be content to reap the Rewards of their Selfishness by forfeiting all Title to the future good Will of their Electors But if their Zeal and Industry for promoting the Ease and Safety of the Nation shall appear to rise in proportion to the Time allowed them for accomplishing the great Work they have begun the  End  will sufficiently commend the  Means  and the Advantages arising to the whole Kingdom from this Change will easily Reconcile it to all such with whom a good Man ought ever to wish to Maintain the Character of Popularity It will certainly be in the Power of those who most apprehend the Odium and Unpopularity of this Action to Secure it from all possible Misrepresentations by making Use of the Power it will bring with it to just and wise Purposes to ease the Debts to perfect the Tranquility and to perpetuate the Peace of the Nation Raising Money by  Taxes  upon  Land  Windows Soap or any thing else is always  Unpopular  and always raises  Clamours  when it is first resolved upon Every thing that hath been done for the Security of His present  Majesty  the suspending the  Habeas Corpus Act  without which We must have been destroyed the granting Him a Power to Raise and Hire Forces for his own and the Nation's Defence the putting his  Friends  into any Possibility of consulting his Safety and Honour Every particular of this sort hath been represented all over the Nation in such Colours that it hath been highly  unpopular  and been attended with great  Clamours  But Necessity and Expedience are the things to be consider'd in all such Points  These  will always make things  pleasing  to the true Friends of the Nation But in order to be  popular  with the  King's  Enemies the first Step he must take must be to lay down his  Crown  and if his  Ministers  be resolved to be moved by  Clamours  they must resign their  Posts  and yield up all Power to those who wish to destroy them The only Consideration is whether the Nation's Affairs require a thing to be done When  that  is fix'd  Popular  or  Unpopular Clamours  or  no Clamours  ought not to affect any farther than about the  manner  of doing it Every thing that touches particular Men's Purses or retrenches from their Luxury will generally be  Unpopular  with those Men But a little Time makes such things easy when the  Publick  finds it's Advantage in it and Men's Passions have had Time to cool  Another thing which I find generally shews it self at first hearing of the  Design  is an  Uneasiness  as if  this  were  Repealing the Act  When in truth I will venture to affirm that it is so far from  that  that it is indeed Restoring it to its best Design and making it effectual to all that Good which was originally purposed and intended by any of those  honest Patriots  who joined in the first framing of it The Designs were that a  King  of  England  should not be  without  a  Parliament  and that  one  and the same  Parliament  should have a  Term  fixed beyond which it should not be in the Power of the  Prince  to continue it And in both these respects the  Act  will be left as it was All the Difference is that the  Parliament  then in being thought  Three Years  the proper Term Experience hath assured us of a Multitude of Evils proceeding from so quick a  Return  of  Elections  And therefore in that part of the  Act  and in  that  only is the  Alteration  intended in order to remedy or abate those  Evils  without bringing in greater  Another  Reason against it is taken from a Suspicion of some private and personal Views in the  King's Ministers  as if the whole Aim were to establish themselves for so much longer time in their Power But I observe that the same Persons who make this  Objection  generally contradict it by affirming that the  Ministers  have nothing to fear and that this present Design is wholly  unnecessary  because a Court may be sure of another  House  of  Commons  to their Mind They must think the  Ministry  very weak not to see this which is so plain that the Influence of a  Court  hath hardly ever fail'd in this Point tho' at the same time the Gentlemen who make this Objection are apt to insinuate the necessity of some Measures for this purpose which cannot be very agreeable to an honest and incorrupt Ministry However in the Opinion of such as allow this it cannot be having a View to  Themselves  but a general View to the  Nation  at  Home  and to the Interest and  Glory of it  Abroad  which engageth the Ministers in this Design They who know the Nature of such Affairs judge the contrary that  Ministers  as to their own private Interest might more probably find their Account in  New Parliaments  than in  One continued  Experience shews that the most  Courtly Parliaments  have turn'd  Uncourtly  in their long sitting And therefore this Design can't be necessary for any private selfinterested Views of their own because it is allowed that such Ends if they have any might be serv'd as well at least in the former Method as in this They who find a  Biass  in their Minds against every thing proposed by a  Court  let it be what it will should consider in this Case whether it be not probable that the present Views and Designs are of a  Publick Nature  rather than of a  Private  and should act accordingly without prejudice or affection as they think it requisite or not for the Establishment of the  King  and the  Nation  and for the more effectual destroying all the Hopes of the Enemies of both  The most powerful  Objection  of all is that the  Alteration  now design'd may make it much more likely that under a  Bad Prince  sometime or other  Arbitrary Power  may b  brought in For the present I am sure we have nothing to fear We have now a  King  upon the  Throne  whose  S  is fashioned to  Right  and  Justice  and whose great enquiry upon all Occasions is what our Constitution and what our Laws require of  Him  We have a  Prince  in View to succeed Him whose  Native Honour  and  Integrity  guard Him against all suspicion But I grant this may not always be our Happiness either in  Possession  or in  Prospect  And therefore if this  All  eration  could be proved I should be moved another way than I am at present There will be more  Time  I acknowledge in any one particular  Parliament  for  Attempts  to be made that way But as I think not at all more likely to succeed On the contrary there is more likelihood that  Gentlem  should by degrees become even ready to part with a Constitution for which there must be such Contention by  Bribery  and all the  Arts  of Iniquity every  Three Years  than if it were otherwise And then again supposing a  Parliament  chosen for  Three Years  only a  Prince  resolutely bent upon doing it in a  Pa  liamentary  way prepared with Treasures and Favours might make such Attempts before that  Term  be expired that none could resist who would not as certainly go on farther in their Integrity One may venture to affirm that a  Parliament  which keeps its Integrity for  Three Years  will discourage the making any such Attempts for the remaining  Four  And to give an Instance if I remember right the  Parliament  which gave up the  Liberties  of  Sweden  gave that Fatal stroke within the  Term  of  Three Years  ▪ Whenever a  Cour  can be bad enough for such a Design they will first take care at the time of Election to set up Persons capable of the same bad Design And then there is no difference between  Three  or  Seven Years  Only here remember what I have before observ'd to you that the quick Returns of  Trienn  al Elections  tend much more to that  Corruption Bribery  Dissoluteness of Manners as well as  PartyRevenge  which pave the way to the loss of  Liberty  than the  longer Term  now proposed can do One might appeal to any who know the World whether it be not more probable as I have urged already that the  Elected Gentlemen  themselves impoverish'd by so frequent Returns of their great  Charges  will be inclined to listen to the Offer made them with so pernicious a View than if the Returns were not so frequent and besides this whether the Influence that way from the powerful motive of  PartyRevenge  will not have vastly more weight when it  roused and irritated and set on Fire by so quick  Returns  of  Contention  than if it were otherwise And what is of great moment in my opinion since it is plain that every Instance of wickedness and divi  ion tending to destruction is so heighten'd and infl  med by the quick  Returns  of  Elections  there must be much greater Encouragement to a  Foreign Enemy  to interpose with his Money to purchase our Ruine in a  Triennial Choice  than in a  Septennial  Especially now before we are well settled upon that Bottom which is the only Foundation of our Happiness It is well known how far the Neighbouring Powers intermeddle in the Elections of  Poland  and  Germany  and with how much success they send their Agents and Factors to them and what an abuse of Liberty this Corruption has introduced in those Countries all the World can testify Nor can we think the Election of a British Parliament so very indifferent a thing to some neighbouring Powers especially at certain Junctures that they should think One or Two Hundred Thousand Pounds misapplied in purchasing Votes to their Mind And I can say that this is no whimsical Supposition because I have my self seen an  Intercepted Letter  written from hence into  France  just before the last  Election  by a Friend to the  Pretender  who had taken the  Oaths  to King  George  plainly hinting both that such a thing was then expected from the King of  France  and that he did not doubt the  Success  of it I think this alone is enough to allarm any true Lover of his Country in the present Situation of our Affairs and of those of all  Europe  There is one more  Objection  I hear is often urged That  We  should have severely blamed such a Design in the late  Administration  Nay that great Horror was express'd at the very supposition of the thing at that time I grant this and that the Horror was just and reasonable But upon what was this founded Not upon the unlawfulness of the thing it self not upon the Impossibility of it's ever being fit to be done but upon a too wellgrounded Assurance that they who were then in Power must have meant it whenever they did it for the same end to which their other Acts tended and that was the utter Ruine of the  GrandAlliance  and of all the Hopes of our best  Friends  Abroad and the inspiring full Vigour into the Cause of  France  and the  Pretender  This was the Ground of all just dread upon that Head Had it been so that they had design'd it manifestly for the firmer Security of the  Protestant Succession  here and the greater support of the  Grand Alliance  abroad no true  Britain  could have had ground of Complaint but must have acknowledg'd if it tended and was n  essary to so good ends that it was not only lawfull but highly praiseworthy An Instance parallel to it may quite take off the Edg  of this  Objection  What honest Mind would not have been filled with  Uneasiness  and  Terror  supposing  They  had then attmpted to suspend the  Habeas Corpus Act  by which they might have confined all Men of great Capacity and Influence whom they knew to be averse to their Proceedings in favour of  France  But would this have been any Argument why the Friends of King  George  should not have secured  Him  and  the Nation  by such a  Suspension  when made necessary by the Treasonable Practices of his avowed Enemies Or because we blame a thing  lawful in it self when we see it design'd for our  therefore must we be averse to a  lawful  thing design'd and tending to our  Preservation  This is the whole strength of that  Objection  which yet I believe weighs with many for want of considering it  As for the  late Ministers  I verily believe they design'd no such thing And my reason for believing so is that they did not at all want it nay that it would have done them more Hurt than Good Their Designs were such as were to be manag'd solely by Artifice The great  Engines  they made use of for keeping up a Spirit against all Truth and Right were those very  Mobbs Riots  and  Tumults  which alone could keep a Multitude in such a Ferment as to make them admire and press for their own Ruine They thought it their Interest to govern by the  Passions  of the Crowd And were very peculiarly dextrous in the Management of them They were possess'd of the full Cry and Noise of the Nation and likely in all probability so to continue This was a much surer Hold to  Them  and to  their  Designs than the Continuance of One and the same  Parliament  And therefore they never attempted it But certainly as that same Spirit which was then raised for the Service of the  Pretender  made it  unnecessary  for  them  so it being still alive and full of evil Influences upon our Happiness this makes it highly prudent in  Others  to do  that  in order to suppress and extirpate it which  They  in their Wisdom would not do for fear of quieting what they expected Benefit from  Their  security consisted in keeping up that vile Spirit to the Heighth It is the security of the  King  and his Government to have a stop put to it and to remove every Opportunity that may give  Fuel  and  Encouragement  to it as far as is consistent with the Constitution and Liberties of the Nation  All these  Considerations  put together have I confess wholly taken off my  First Surprize  And the same Considerations make me hope that all true Friends to the  King  and to the  Publick Happiness  which now depends entirely upon the firm  Establishment  of the present Royal Family will not let their  General Suspicion  or their  Particular Biass  have such Power over them as to move them to join with their own  Enemies  in a  Point  in which if they should by any unforeseen Accident have  Success  I am confident they would very heartily as well as fruitlesly  repe    of their own Proceedings When Persons who have always shewn themselves  Enemies  to Liberty and Professors of the  Principles  of Slavery who have ever express'd a Hatred of the  Revolution  and of every thing built upon it and have ever been the Supports of the  Popish  and  Jacobite  Interest in these Nations When such I say put on a Zeal for  Liberty  it is a Moral Demonstration that it is all a  M  ckShew  and that they themselves think quite otherwise of what they oppose than they would seem to think If it were really their Opinion that the  Alteration  now proposed would either help the  Cause  which they have espoused or be any Prejudice to a  Government  which they hate I am very confident they would not enter into the  Opposition  of it with that  Warmth  and  Heat  which they now profess But they foresee that their  Hopes  must in Proportion abate with those  Heats  and  Disturbances  which alone keep them alive and for this Reason it is that they now take into their Mouths the  rds  and  Topicks  which they have ever hitherto ridiculed and exploded in order to keep off the  T  ng  which they heartily hate  the Settlement of the present Government in Peace and Quiet at Home and in Honour and Glory Abroad  And this is one very good Reason why  All  who truly wish well to that  Settlement  should unite in the  Alteration  of that which is the  Chief  if not the  Only  thing left to keep up the Spirits and Designs of its Enemies But if when it is in our Power to put some Stop to our present  Corruptions  and  Distractions  and to establish the  Glory  of our  King  and the Happiness of our Country in a Method perfectly confident with all our Rights and Liberties we are guided by the Insinuations of those who hate us and refuse to do it we must thank our selves for all that follows It will lie at our Door to answer for all the Consequences of such a Neglect From  these  with whom we join in it we have no Returns to expect but Contempt Reproaches and Insults  In fine I can consider the  Triennial Return  of our  Elections  no otherwise than as what hath made us and still continues us the most Divided and most Corrupted of  Nations  what was at first by many contrived and still in its own Nature tends to oppose the Designs of the  Best Kings  and to promote those of the  Worst  leading to an universal Debauchery of the Manners and Tempers of the  Electors  as well as to make the  Elected  themselves weary enough of such perpetual Contests and Charge to incline some Time or other to  Thoughts  which would not otherwise find Admittance influencing the  People  to think easily of becoming a Prey to the  Highest Bidder  keeping up the  Spirits  of our  Common Enemies  and creating Diffidence and Uneasiness in our  best Friends  introducing and increasing all Excesses of Violence and Mutual Revenge serving a  Multitude  of  bad  Purposes which have a peculiar Malignity at this particular Juncture without having  one  good Effect fit to be named in Opposition to them And all this occasioned by the  Shortness  of the  Interval  allowed either to put an End to such Evils or to cultivate any thing that is Good To cure all these entirely nothing can perhaps be thought of but what would introduce greater To apply something that may put an  End  to  some  of them and abate and diminish the rest is a Matter that deserves the Regard of every good  Briton  And I believe at this Time nothing at all effectual can be thought of without an  Alteration  of the  Triennial Elections  I am  c  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  S Gray  in  AmenCorner  Price Three HalfPence
