 TAMERLANE A TRAGEDY  TAMERLANE A TRAGEDY  As it is Acted at the NEW THEATER IN  Little LincolnsInnFields  By Her MAJESTY's SERVANTS  Written by  N ROWE    Esq  Magnus ad altum  Fulminat Euphraten bello Victorque volentes  Per Populos dat jura viam{que} affectat Olympo  Virg Georg  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  And Sold by  William Davis  at the  Black Bull  over against the Royal Exchange in  Cornhill    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM LORD MARQUISS Of HARTINGTON  My LORD  EVery Body is now so full of Business that things of this kind which are generally taken for the Entertainment of leisure Hours only look like Impertinence and Interruption I am sure it is a Reason why I ought to beg your Lordship's Pardon for troubling you with this Tragedy Not but that Poetry has always been and will still be the Entertainment of all wise Men that have any Delicacy in their Knowledge Yet at so Critical a Juncture as this is I must confess I think your Lordship ought to give intirely into those Publick Affairs which at this time seem to Demand you It is that happy Turn which your Lordship has to Business that right Understanding of your Country's Interest and that constant Zeal to pursue it that just Thinking that strong and per  suasive Elocution that firm and generous Resolution which upon all Occasions you have shewn in Parliaments and to add that which is the crowning good Quality your Lordship's continual Adherence and Unshaken Loyalty to His present Majesty which make you at this time so necessary to the Publick I must confess tho' there is no part in your Lordship's Character but what the World should be fond of I cannot help Distinguishing the last Instance very particularly It is doing methinks such a Justice to Goodness to Greatness and to Right Reason that Posterity will believe there could be no Man of good Sense but what must have agreed with your Lordship in it When the next Age shall Read the History of this What Excuse can they make for those who did not Admire a Prince whose Life has been a Series of good Offices done to Mankind When they shall reckon up his Labours from the Battle of  Seneff  to some Glorious Action which shall be his Last and which I therefore hope is very far remov'd from the Present Time Will they ever believe that he could have been too well lov'd or too faithfully serv'd and defended The Great Things which he did before we had that immediate Interest in him which we now happily have is a noble and just Subject for Panegyrick but as Benefits done to Others can never touch us so sensibly as those we receive our selves tho' the Actions may be equally great so methinks I can hardly have patience to run back to his having sav'd his own Country when I consider he has since done the same for Us Let that be sufficient to Us for all we can say of him or do for him What Dangers and  Difficulties has he not struggled through for the Honour and Safety of these Kingdoms 'Tis a common Praise and what every one speaks to say He has continually expos'd his Life for his People But there are some things more particular in his Character some things rarely found amongst the Policies of Princes a Zeal for Religion moderated by Reason without the Rage and Fire of Persecution a charitable Compassion for those who cannot be convinc'd and an unalterable Perseverance in those Principles of whose Truth he is satisfy'd a desire of War for the sake of Peace and of Peace for the Good and Honour of his Subjects equally with his own a pious Care for composing Factions tho' to foment them might make him Arbitrary and a generous Ambition that only aims at Pow'r to enable him to do good to all the rest of the World I might add here that Inviolable and Religious Observance of his Royal Word which the best part of the Pow'rs of  Europe  have so frequently and so happily for themselves depended upon in the greatest Emergencies But as this Virtue is generally reckon'd as no more than that common Honesty which the meanest Man would blush to be without so it can hardly claim a Place amongst the more particular Excellencies of a Great Prince It were to be wish'd indeed that the World were honest to such a degree and that there were not that scandalous defect of common Morality Certainly nothing can be more shocking to Humanity to the Peace and Order of the World nothing can approach nearer to that Savage state of Nature in which every Man is to eat  his fellow if he can master him than an avow'd Liberty of breaking thro' all the most solemn Engagements of publick Faith 'Tis something that brands a Man with an Infamy which nothing can extenuate or wipe out he may protest and pretend to explain his meaning but the World has generally too much indignation for the Affront to bear it at that easie rate Ministers and Secretaries of State may display their own Parts in Memorials with as much Pomp and Flourish as they please I fancy the common answer upon such Occasions will always be You have deceiv'd us grosly and we neither can nor will trust you any more When this Vice comes amongst Men of the first Rank it is the more shocking and I could wish there were none such to whose charge it might be laid  Some People who do me a very great Honour in it have fancy'd that in the Person of  Tamerlane  I have alluded to the greatest Character of the present Age I don't know whether I ought not to apprehend a great deal of Danger from avowing a Design like that It may be a Task indeed worthy the greatest Genius which this or any other Time has produc'd But therefore I ought not to stand the shock of a Parallel least it should be seen to my Disadvantage how far the  Hero  has  transcended the Poet's Thought  There are many Features 'tis true in that Great Man's Life not unlike His Majesty His Courage his Piety his Moderation his Justice and his Fatherly Love of his People but above all his Hate of Tyranny and Oppression and his zea lous Care for the Common Good of Mankind  large Resemblance of Him Several Incidents are alike in their Stories and there wants nothing to his Majesty but such a deciding Victory as that by which  Tamerlane  gave Peace to the World That is yet to come But I hope we may reasonably expect it from the unanimity of the present Parliament and so formidable a Force as that Unanimity will give Life and Vigour to  If your Lordship can find any thing in this Poem like a Prince who is so justly the Object of your Lordship's and indeed of the World's Veneration I persuade my self it will prevail with you to forgive every thing else that you find amiss You will excuse the Faults in Writing for the goodness of the Intention I hope too your Lordship will not be displeas'd that I take this opportunity of renewing the Honour which I formerly had to be known to your Lordship and which gives me at once the Pleasure of expressing those Just and Dutiful Sentiments I have for his Majesty and that strong Inclination which I have always had to be thought  My Lord  Your Lordships most Obedient Humble Servant N ROWE  PROLOGUE  Spoke by Mr  BETTERTON  OF all the Muses various Labours none  Have lasted longer or have higher flown  Than those that tell the Fame by ancient Hero's won  With Pleasure  Rome  and Great  Augustus  heard  Arms and the Man sung by the  Mantuan  Bard  In spight of Time the sacred Story lives  And  Caesar  and his Empire still survives  Like him tho' much unequal to his Flame  Our Author makes a pious Prince his Theme  High with the foremost Names in Arms he stood  Had fought and suffer'd for his Country's Good  Yet sought not Fame but Peace in Fields of Blood  Safe under him his happy People sate  And griev'd at distance for their Neighbours Fate  Whilst with Success a  Turkish  Monarch Crown'd  Like spreading Flame deform'd the Nations round  With Sword and Fire he forc'd his impious way  To Lawless Pow'r and Universal Sway  Some abject States for fear the Tyrant join  Others for Gold their Liberties resign  And venal Princes sold their Right Divine  'Till Heav'n the growing Evil to redress  Sent  Tamerlane  to give the World a Peace  The Hero rouz'd asserts the Glorious Cause  And to the Field the chearful Soldier draws  Around in Crowds his valiant Leaders wait  Anxious for Glory and secure of Fate  Well pleas'd once more to venture on his side  And prove that Faith again which had so oft been  y'd  The peaceful Fathers who in Senates meet  Approve an Enterprize so Just so Great  While with their Prince's Arms their Voice thus join'd  Gains half the Praise of having sav'd Mankind  Ev'n in a Circle where like this the Fair  Were met the bright Assembly did declare  Their House with one consent were for the War  Each urg'd her Lover to unsheath his Sword  And never spare a Man who broke his Word  Thus fir'd the Brave on to the Danger press  Their Arms were crown'd abroad with just Success  And blest at Home with Beauty and with Peace

Tamerlane  's Tent  Enter the Prince of  Tanais    Zama  and  Mirvan  Pr of  T  HAIL to the Sun from whose returning Light  The chearful Soldier's Arms new Lustre take  To deck the Pomp of Battle Oh my Friends  Was ever such a glorious Face of War  See from this height how all  Galatia  's Plains  With Nations numberless are cover'd o'er  Who like a Deluge hide the Face of Earth  And leave no Object in the vast Horizon  But glitt'ring Arms and Skies  Zam  Our  Asian  World  From this important Day expects a Lord  This day they hope an end of all their Woes  Of Tyranny of Bondage and Oppression  From our Victorious Emp'ror  Tamerlane  Mir  Well has our Holy  Alha  mark'd him out  The Scourge of lawless Pride and dire Ambition  The great Avenger of the groaning World  Well has he worn the sacred Cause of Justice  Upon his prosp'rous Sword approving Heav'n  Still Crown'd the Righteous Warrior with Success  As if he said Go forth and be my Champion  Thou most like me of all my Works below  Pr  No lust of Rule the common Vice of Kings  No furious Zeal inspir'd by hotbrain'd Priests  Ill hid beneath Religion's specious Name  E'er drew his temp'rate Courage to the Field  But to redress an injur'd People's Wrongs  To save the weak One from the strong Oppressor  Is all his end of War and when he draws  The Sword to punish like relenting Heav'n  He seems unwilling to deface his Kind  Mir  So rich his Soul in every virtuous Grace  That had not Nature made him great by Birth  Yet all the Brave had sought him for their Friend  The Christian Prince  Axalla  nicely bred  In polish'd Arts of  Europaean  Courts  For him forsakes his native  Italy  And lives a happy Exile in his Service  Pr  Pleas'd with the gentle Manners of that Prince  Our mighty Lord is lavish to his Friendship  Tho'  Omar  and the  Tartar  Lords repine  And loudly tax their Monarch as too partial  Zam  E'er the mid Hour of Night from Tent to Tent  Unweary'd thro' the num'rous Host he past  Viewing with careful Eyes each sev'ral Quarter  Whilst from his Looks as from Divinity  The Soldiers took presage and cry'd Lead on  Great  Alha  and our Emperor Lead on  To Victory and Everlasting Fame  Mir  Hear you of  Bajazet  Pri  Late in the Evening  A Slave of near Attendance on his Person  'Scap'd to our Camp from him we learn'd the Tyrant  With Rage redoubled for the Fight prepares  Some accidental Passion fires his Breast  Love as 'tis thought for a fair  Grecian  Captive  And adds new Horror to his native Fury  For five returning Suns scarce was he seen  By any the most favour'd of his Court  But in lascivious Ease among his Women  Liv'd from the War retir'd or else alone  In sullen mood sate meditating Plagues  And Ruin to the World 'till yester Morn  Like Fire that lab'ring upwards rends the Earth  He burst with Fury from his Tent Commanding  All should be ready for the Fight this Day  Zam  I know his Temper well since in his Court  Companion of the brave  Axalla  's Embassy  I oft observ'd him Proud Impatient  Of Ought Superiour ev'n of Heav'n that made him  Fond of false Glory of the Salvage Pow'r  Of ruling without Reason of confounding  Just and Unjust by an Unbounded Will  By whom Religion Honour all the Bands  That ought to hold the jarring World in Peace  Were held the Tricks of State Snares of wise Princes  To draw their easie Neighbours to Destruction  Mir  Thrice by our Law and Prophet has he sworn  By the World's Lord and Maker lasting Peace  With our great Master and his Royal Friend  The  Grecian  Emperor as oft regardless  Of plighted Faith with most UnKingly Baseness  H' has ta'en th' Advantage of their absent Arms  Without a War proclaim'd or Cause pretended  To waste with Sword and Fire their fruitful Fields  Like some accursed Fiend who 'scap'd from Hell  Poisons the balmy Air thro' which he flies  He blasts the bearded Corn and loaded Branches  The lab'ring Hind's best hopes and marks his way with ruin  Pr  But see his Fate the mighty  Tamerlane  Comes like the Proxy of enquiring Heav'n  To Judge and to Redress  Flourish of Trumpets  Enter  Tamerlane  Guards and other Attendants  Tam  Yet yet a little and destructive Slaughter  Shall rage around and marr this beauteous Prospect  Pass but an hour which stands betwixt the Lives  Of Thousands and Eternity What Change  Shall hasty Death make in yon gli  'ring Plain  Oh thou sell Monster War That in a moment  Lay'st waste the noblest part of the Creation  The Boast and Masterpiece of the Great Maker  That wears in vain th' Impression of his Image  Unpriviledg'd from thee  Health to our Friends and to our Arms Success  To the Prince  Zama  and  Mir  Such as the Cause for which we fight deserves  Pr  Nor can we ask beyond what Heav'n bestows  Preventing still our Wishes See Great Sir  The Universal Joy your Soldiers wear  Omen of prosp'rous Battle  Impatient of the tedious Night in Arms  Watchful they stood expecting op'ning day  And now are hardly by their Leaders held  From darting on the Foe like a hot Courser  That bounding Paws the mould'ring Soil disdaining  The Rein that checks him eager for the Race  Tam  Yes Prince I mean to give a loose to War  This Morn  Axalla  with my  Parthian  Horse  Arrives to joyn me He who like a Storm  Swept with his flying Squadrons all the Plain  Between  Angoria  's Walls and yon tall Mountains  That seem to reach the Clouds and now he comes  Loaden with Spoils and Conquest to my aid  Zam  These Trumpets speak his Presence  Flourish of Trumpets  Enter  Axalla  with Soldiers  Moneses    Stratocles  and  Selima  Prisoners    Axalla  kneels to  Tamerlane  Tam  Wellcome thou worthy Partner of my Laurels  Thou Brother of my Choice a Band more Sacred  Than Nature's brittle Tye By holy Friendship  Glory and Fame stood still for thy arrival  My Soul seem'd wanting in its better half  And languish'd for thy absence like a Prophet  That waits the Inspiration of his God  Ax  My Emperor my ever Royal Master  To whom my Secret Soul more lowly bends  Than Forms of outward Worship can express  How poorly does your Soldier pay this Goodness  Who wears his every hour of Life out for you  Yet 'tis his All and what he has he offers  Nor now disdain t' accept the Gift he brings  This earnest of your Fortune See my Lord  The noblest Prize that ever grac'd my Arms  Approach my Fair  Tam  This is indeed to Conquer  And well to be rewarded for thy Conquest  The Bloom of opening Flow'rs unsully'd Beauty  Softness and sweetest Innocence she wears  And looks like Nature in the World's first Spring  But say  Axalla    Sel  Most Renown'd in War  Kneeling to  Tam  Look with Compassion on a Captive Maid  Kneeling to  Tam  Tho' born of Hostile Blood nor let my Birth  Deriv'd from  Bajazet  prevent that Mercy  Which every Subject of your Fortune finds  War is the Province of Ambitious Man  Who tears the miserable World for Empire  Whilst our weak Sex incapable of wrong  On either side claims Priviledge of Safety  Tam  Raising her  Rise Royal Maid the pride of haughty Pow'r  Pays Homage not receives it from the Fair  Thy Angry Father fiercely calls me forth  And urges me unwillingly to Arm  Yet tho' our frowning Battles menace Death  And mortal Conflict think not that we hold  Thy Innocence and Virtue as our Foe  Here 'till the Fate of  Asia  is decided  In safety stay To Morrow is your own  Nor grieve for who may Conquer or who Lose  Fortune on either side shall wait thy Wishes  Sel  Where shall my Wonder and my Praise begin  From the successful Labours of thy Arms  Or from a Theme more soft and full of Peace  Thy Mercy and thy Gentleness Oh  Tamerlane    What can I pay thee for this noble Usage  But greatful Praise So Heav'n it self is paid  Give Peace ye Pow'rs above Peace to Mankind  Not let my Father wage unequal War  Against the Force of such united Virtues  Tam  Heav'n hear thy pious WishBut since our Prospect  Looks darkly on Futurity 'till Fate  Determine for us let thy Beauty's safety  Be my  Axalla  's Care in whose glad Eyes  I read what Joy the pleasing Service gives him  Is there amongst thy other Pris'ners ought  To  Axalla  Worthy our Knowledge  Ax  This brave Man my Lord  Pointing to  Moneses  With long resistance held the Combat doughtful  Pointing to  Moneses  His Party prest with Numbers soon grew faint  And would have left their Charge an easie Prey  Whilst he alone undaunted at the odds  Tho' hopeless to escape fought well and firmly  Nor yielded 'till o'er match'd by many Hands  He seem'd to shame our Conquest whilst he own'd it  Tam  Thou speak'st him as a Soldier should a Soldier  Just to the worth he finds I would not war  To  Moneses  With ought that wears thy virtuous Stamp of Greatness  Thy Habit speaks thee ChristianNay yet more  My Soul seems pleas'd to take acquaintance with thee  As if ally'd to thine Perhaps 'tis Sympathy  Of honest Minds like Strings wound up in Musick  Where by one touch both utter the same Harmony  Why art thou then a Friend to  Bajazet  And why my Enemy  Mon  If human Wisdom  Could point out every Action of our Lives  And say Let it be thus in spite of Fate  Or partial Fortune then I had not been  The Wretch I am  Tam  The Brave meet every Accident  With equal Minds Think nobler of thy Foes  Than to account thy Chance in War an Evil  Mon  Far far from that I rather hold it grieveous  That I was forc'd ev'n but to seem your Enemy  Nor think the baseness of a vanquish'd Slave  Moves me to slatter for precarious Life  Or illbought Freedom when I swear by Heav'n  Were I to chuse from all Mankind a Master  It should be  Tamerlane  Tam  A noble Freedom  Dwells with the Brave unknown to fawning Sycophants  And Claims a Privilege of being believ'd  I take thy Praise as earnest of thy Friendship  Mon  Still you prevent the Homage I should offer  O Royal Sir let my Misfortunes plead  And wipe away the hostile Mark I wore  I was when not long since my Fortune hail'd me  Bless'd to my wish I was the Prince  Moneses  Born and bred up to Greatness Witness the Blood  Which thro' successive Hero's Veins ally'd  To our  Greek  Emperors roll'd down to me  Feeds the bright Flame of Glory in my Heart  Tam  Ev'n that that Princely Tye should bind thee to me  If Virtue were not more than all Alliance  Mon  I have a Sister Oh severe Remembrance  Our Noble Houses nay her Sexe's Pride  Nor think my Tongue too lavish if I speak her  Fair as the Fame of Virtue and yet chaste  As its cold Precepts wise beyond her Sex  And blooming Youth soft as forgiving Mercy  Yet greatly brave and jealous for her Honour  Such as she was to say I barely lov'd her  Is poor to my Soul's meaning From our Infancy  There grew a mutual Tenderness between us  'Till not long since her Vows were kindly plighted  To a young Lord the Equal of her Birth  The happy Day was fix'd and now approaching  When faithless  Bajazet  upon whose Honour  In solemn Treaty giv'n the  Greeks  depended  With sudden War broke in upon the Country  Secure of Peace and for Defence unready  Tam  Let Majesty no more be held Divine  Since Kings who are call'd Gods profane themselves  Mon  Among the Wretches whom that Deluge swept  Away to Slavery my self and Sister  Then passing near the Frontiers to the Court  Which waited for her Naptials were surpriz'd  And made the Captives of the Tyrant's Power  Soon as we reach'd his Court we found our Usage  Beyond what we expected fair and noble  'Twas then the Storm of your victorious Arms  Look'd black and seem'd to threaten when he press'd me  By oft repeated Instances to draw  My Sword for him But when he found my Soul  Disdain'd his Purpose he more fiercely told me  That my  Arpasia  my lov'd Sister's Fate  Depended on my Courage shewn for him  I had long learnt to hold my self at nothing  But for her sake to ward the Blow from her  I bound my Service to the Man I hated  Six Days are past since by the Sultan's Order  I left the Pledge of my return behind  And went to guard this Princess to his Camp  The rest the brave  Axalla  's Fortune tells you  Tam  Wisely the Tyrant strove to prop his Cause  By leaguing with thy Virtue but just Heav'n  Has torn thee from his Side and left him naked  To the avenging Bolt that drives upon him  Forget the Name of Captive and I wish  I could as well restore that Fair One's Freedom  Whose loss hangs heavy on thee Yet e'er Night  Perhaps we may deserve thy Friendship nobler  Th' approaching Storm may cast thy Shipwreck'd Wealth  Back to thy Arms 'Till that be past since War  Tho' in the justest Cause is ever doubtful  I will not ask thy Sword to aid my Victory  Lest it should hurt that Hostage of thy Valour  Our common Foe detains  Mon  Let  Bajazet  Bend to his Yoak repining Slaves by sorce  You Sir have found a nobler way to Empire  Lord of the willing World  Tam  Oh my  Axalla  Thou hast a tender Soul apt for Compassion  And art thy self a Lover and a Friend  Does not this Prince's Fortune move thy Temper  Ax  Yes Sir I mourn the brave  Moneses  Fate  The Merit of his Virtue hardly match'd  With disadvent'rous Chance Yet Prince allow me  Allow me from th' Experience of a Lover  To say one Person whom your Story mention'd  If he survive is far beyond you wretched  You nam'd the Bridegroom of your beauteous Sister  Mon  I did Oh most accurst  Ax  Think what he feels  Dash'd in the fierceness of his Expectation  Then when th' approaching Minute of Possession  Had wound Imagination to the heighth  Think if he lives  Mon  He lives he does 'tis true  He lives but how To be a Dog and dead  Were Paradise to such a State as his  He holds down Life as Children do a Potion  With strong Reluctance and convulsive Strugglings  Whilst his Misfortunes press him to disgorge it  Tam  Spare the remembrance 'tis a useless Grief  And adds to the Misfortune by repeating it  The revolution of a Day may bring  Such Turns as Heav'n it self could scarce have promis'd  Far far beyond thy Wish Let that Hope chear thee  Haste my  Axalla  to dispose with safety  Thy beauteous Charge and on the Foe revenge  The Pain which Absence gives thy other care  Honour and Arms now summon thy Attendance  Now do thy Office well my Soul remember  Thy Cause the Cause of Heav'n and injur'd Earth  O thou Supream if thy great Spirit warms  My glowing Breast and fires my Soul to Arms  Grant that my Sword assisted by thy Pow'r  This Day may Peace and Happiness restore  That War and lawless Rage may vex thy World no more  Exeunt  Tamerlane    Moneses    Stratocles  Prince of  Tanais    Zama    Mirvan  and Attendants  Manent  Axalla  and  Selima  with Soldiers  Ax  The Battle calls and bids me hasse to leave thee  Oh  But let Destruction  Are there not Hours enough for Blood and Slaughter  This moment shall be Love's and I will waste it  In soft Complainings for thy Sighs and Coldness  For thy forgetful Coldness even at  Birza  When in thy Father's Court my Eyes first own'd thee  Fairer than Light the Joy of their beholding  Ev'n then thou wert not thus  Sel  Art not thou chang'd  Christian  Axalla  Art thou still the same  Those were the gentle Hours of Peace and thou  The World's good Angel that didst kindly join  Its mighty Masters in harmonious Friendship  But since those Joys that once were ours are lost  Forbear to mention 'em and talk of War  Talk of thy Conquest and my Chains  Axalla  Ax  Yet I will listen fair unkind Upbraider  Yet I will listen to thy charming Accents  Altho' they make me curse my Fame and Fortune  My Laurelwreaths and all the glorious Trophies  For which the Valiant bleedOh thou unjust one  Dost thou then envy me this small return  My niggard Fate has made for all the Mournings  For all the Pains for all the sleepless Nights  That cruel Absence brings  Sel  Away Deceiver  I will not hear thy soothing Is it thus  That Christian Lovers prove the Faith they swear  Are War and Slavery the soft Endearments  With which they Court the Beauties they admire  'Twas well my Heart was cautious of believing  Thy Vows and thy Protesting Know my Conqueror  Thy Sword has vanquish'd but the half of  Selima  Her Soul disdains thy Victory  Ax  Hear sweet Heav'n  Hear the fair Tyrant how she wrests Love's Laws  As she had vow'd my Ruin What is Conquest  What Joy have I from that but to behold thee  To kneel before thee and with lifted Eyes  To view thee as Devotion does a Saint  With awful trembling Pleasure Then to swear  Thou art the Queen and Mistress of my Soul  Has not ev'n  Tamerlane  whose Word next Heav'ns  Makes Fate at second hand bid thee disclaim  Thy Fears And dost thou call thy self a Slave  Only to try how far the sad Impression  Can sink into  Axalla  Sel  Oh  Axalla  Ought I to hear you  Ax  Come back ye Hours  And tell my  Selima  what she has done  Bring back the time when to her Father's Court  I came Ambassador of Peace from  Tamerlane  When hid by conscious Darkness and Disguise  I past the Dangers of the watchful Guards  Bold as the Youth who nightly swam the  Hellespont  Then then she was not sworn the Foe of Love  When as my Soul confest its Flame and su'd  In moving sounds for Pity she frown'd rarely  But blushing heard me tell the gentle Tale  Nay ev'n confest and told me softly sighing  She thought there was no guilt in Love like mine  Sel  Young and unskilful in the World's false Arts  I suffer'd Love to steal upon my Softness  And warm me with a lambent guiltless Flame  Yes I have heard thee swear a thousand times  And call the conscious Pow'rs of Heav'n to witness  The tend'rest truest everlasting Passion  But Oh 'tis past and I will charge Remembrance  To banish the sond Image from my Soul  Since thou art sworn the Foe of Royal  Bajazet  I have resolv'd to hate thee  Ax  Is it possible  Hate is not in thy Nature thy whole Frame  Is Harmony without one jarring Atom  Why do'st thou sorce thy Eyes to wear this Coldness  It damps the Springs of Life Oh bid me die  Much rather bid me die if it be true  That thou hast sworn to hate me  Sel  Let Life and Death  Wait the Decision of the bloody Field  Nor can thy Fate my Conqueror depend  Upon a Woman's Hate Yet since you urge  A Power which once perhaps I had there is  But one Request that I can make with Honour  Ax  Oh name it say  Sel  Forego your right of War  And render me this instant to my Father  Ax  ImpossibleThe tumult of the Battle  That hastes to joyn cuts off all means of Commerce  Betwixt the Armies  Sel  Swear then to perform it  Which way soe'er the chance of War determines  On my first instance  Ax  By the sacred Majesty  Of Heav'n to whom we kneel I will obey thee  Yes I will give thee this severest Proof  Of my Soul's vow'd Devotion I will part with thee  Thou Cruel to command it I will part with thee  As Wretches that are doubtful of Hereafter  Part with their Lives unwilling loth and fearful  And trembling at Futurity But is there nothing  No small return that Honour can afford  For all this waste of Love  Sel  The Gifts of Captives  Wear somewhat of Constraint and generous Minds  Disdain to give where freedom of the Choice  Does but seem wanting  Ax  What not one kind Look  Then thou art chang'd indeed  Trumpets  Hark I am summon'd  And thou wilt send me forth like one unbless'd  Whom Fortune has forsaken and ill Fate  Mark'd for Destruction Thy surprising Coldness  Hangs on my Soul and weighs my Courage down  And the first feeble Blow I meet shall raze me  From all Remembrance Nor is Life or Fame  Worthy my Care since I am lost to thee  Going  Sel  Ha Goest thou to the Fight  Ax  I doFarewel  Sel  What and no more A Sigh heaves in my Breast  And stops the struggling Accents on my Tongue  Else sure I should have added something more  And made our Parting softer  Ax  Give it way  The niggard Honour that affords not Love  Forbids not Pity  Sel  Fate perphaps has set  This Day the Period of thy Life and Conquests  And I shall see thee born at Evening back  A breathless CoarseOh Can I think on that  And hide my SorrowsNothey will have way  And all the Vital Air that Life draws in  Is render'd back in Sighs  Ax  The murm'ring Gale revives the drooping Flame  That at thy Coldness languish'd in my Breast  So breath the gentle Zephyrs on the Spring  And waken every Plant and od'rous Flower  Which Winter Frosts had blasted to new Life  Sel  To see thee for this moment and no more  Oh help me to resolve against this Tenderness  That charms my fierce Resentments and presents thee  Not as thou art mine and my Father's Foe  But as thou wert when first thy moving Accents  Won me to hear when as I listn'd to thee  The happy Hours past by us unperceiv'd  So was my Soul fix'd to the soft Enchantment  Ax  Let me be still the same I am I must be  If it were possible my Heart could stray  One Look from thee would call it back again  And fix the Wanderer for ever thine  Sel  Where is my boasted Resolution now  Sinking into his Arms  Oh Yes Thou art the same my Heart joins with thee  Sinking into his Arms  And to betray me will believe thee still  It dances to the Sounds that mov'd it first  And owns at once the weakness of my Soul  So when some skilful Artist strikes the Strings  The magick Numbers rouze our sleeping Passions  And force us to confess our Grief and Pleasure  Alas  Axalla  saydost thou not pity  My artless Innocence and easie Fondness  Oh turn thee from me or I die with blushing  Ax  Nolet me rather gaze for ever gaze  And bless the newborn Glories that adorn thee  From every Blush that kindles in thy Cheeks  Ten thousand little Loves and Graces spring  To revel in the Roses'two' not be  Trumpets  This envious Trumpet calls and tears me from thee  Sel  My Fears increase and doubly press me now  I charge thee if thy Sword comes cross my Father  Stop for a moment and remember me  Ax  Oh doubt not but his Life shall be my care  Ev'n dearer than my own  Sel  Guard that for me too  Ax  Oh  Selima  thou hast restor'd my quiet  The noble ardour of the War with Love  Returning brightly burns within my Breast  And bids me be secure of all hereafter  So chears some pious Saint a dying Sinner  Who trembled at the thought of Pains to come  With Heav'ns Forgiveness and the hopes of Mercy  At length the tumult of his Soul appeas'd  And every Doubt and anxious Scruple eas'd
