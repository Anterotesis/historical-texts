strange that authors who so rarely find  Their pray'rs can move an audience to be kind  Still send with piteous tone and look forlorn  The Prologue forth to deprecate your scorn  Such doleful heralds which would fain appear  The timid struggles of a modest fear  The surly Critic views with jealous spleen  As the dull presage of the coming scene  In vain the dread hostility to calm  E'en potent Flatt'ry tries her soothing balm  Pity's a crime his losty soul disdains  And his pride feasts upon the poet's pains  Yet now no critic rancour need we fear  For lib'ral candour holds her empire here  Candour who scorns for little faults to pry  But looks on merits with a partial eye  And sure a bard whose muse so oft has found  The happy pow'r to kindle mirth around  Though in her sportive moods averse to trace  The rigid forms of  Action Time  and  Place  While gen'rous objects animate her view  May still her gay luxuriant course pursue  For mid her whims she still has shewn the art  To press the USEFUL MORAL on the heart  With just contempt the worthless to discard  And deal to VIRTUE its deserv'd reward  So aim'd the bard  HORACE  if haply we may dare  Our humble scenes with noblest strains compare  The bard whose favour'd muse could joy afford  That eas'd the cares of Rome's Imperial Lord  Who in her satire frolicksome and wild  Gave vice the deepest wounds when most she

Sir but if acquainted in my affairs surely by my uncle's will I am  Dickins  A man's  last  will is the clincher tho' he had made fifty before you are left a trifling legacy and a handsome education so must now battle it out for yourself  Fanny  I could cry for her misfortune if I wasn't glad at its making us more equal Before I admir'd but now I shall love her dearly  Dickins  My generosity is

reflection that I was to possess what belong'd to an unfortunate relative the unforgiving spirit of her obdurate parent took the birthright from his own lamented daughter cast down I could be happy

how are you qualified for this office what is your idea of the duties in bringing up a young woman  Augusta  Sir by the mouth of a parent she receives admonition from Heaven itself and when he commits that charge to another it is indeed sacred The care of youth is an arduous and delicate trust of confidence and honor I look upon truth cleanliness and frugality to be the first principles in a lady's education They preserve to her mind person and means purity health and independence of obligation which thro' the devious paths of her future life to the unsuspecting female is often the concealed adder for the destruction of her innocence  Dickins  She set out pretty well about my heavenly authority and my delicate mouth but lord she has got quite out    aside    well in truth my dear your quondam guardian bid me break this affair in a rough way to lower your spirit to your situation but it's my intention to treat you with kindness and respect    aside    This will do me no harm when
