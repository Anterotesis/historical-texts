beauty or scarcity the  P La∣thonia  is little if by any means inferior to the most beautiful and as a rare Insect is esteemed an invaluable acquisition  The upper side is only a plain orange or brown colour with spots of strong black and does not in general appearance differ materially from the greasy Fritillary Butterfly which is very common in most situations but the underside is entirely unlike every other English Insect the bright silver splashes on the under wings are singular in their form and so beautifully relieved by the orange ground colour and variegation of black between as to form a delightful contrast of the most pleasing colours  Whether this species was originally a native of this country may be doubtful we certainly have the most respectable testimonies of its being taken alive in different parts of the kingdom but it might have been introduced by accident in the larva or more probably in the pupa state it has been seen at  Bath  and either  Moses Harris  or some of his friends bred it from the caterpillar "Queen of Spain Fritillaria changed into chryfalis  April  appeared in the winged state  May  th  Gambling Gay wood  near  Cambridge"  It has also been taken

The Linnaean description of the  Curculio Betulae  so nearly corre∣sponds with that of  C Populi  that if we allow for the variation of colour to which all Insects are subject a line can scarcely be drawn between the two species the most material distinction is the underside of  C Betulae  being of the same colour as the back but the underside of  C Populi  is purple and smaller  The description which  Linnaeus  has given of our species is  longi∣rostris corpore viridi aurato subtus concolore  and  Degeer  has de∣scribed it in similar words It is evident that  Linnaeus  had reason to suspect some difference of colour between the two sexes but perhaps he never imagined the  C Purpureus  Berkenhout  in his Outlines of the Natural History of  GreatBritain  says  C Purpureus  Glossy Purple Snout very long  Petiver  found this at  Epsom  which he had before described was also one sex or a variety of the same Insect  Geoffroy  says  "Rhinomacer  totus viridi coeruleus" and  Fabricius  adds  Variat saepius colore omnino coeruleo Alter sexus thoracem antrorsum spinosum gerit  How those different descriptions may be reconciled so as to be descriptive of the two sexes of  C Betulae  will appear more clearly on farther observation  Late in  May  this season being at  DarentWood Dartford  I met with one of the green kind and one of a dark blue colour with a shade of green on the elytra I could not be deceived they were male and female as a farther corroboration I met with a second pair in a similar situation and on the day following a third the blue one of this last pair had not the shade of green as on the former but was of a rich glossy blue purple and I am greatly mistaken if it is not the  C Purpureus  of  Linnaeus  or the Insect which is arranged in  English  Cabinets for that species  I communicated the circumstance of meeting with those two Insects which have always been considered as distinct kinds to a person who also was collecting Insects in the wood on the same day and he in∣formed me that he had just before discovered them in the same situation I have examined them very carefully but cannot discover any spines on the thorax of the green and gold kind though I have five of them but the three purple specimens are all spinous as described by authors I am of opinion that the bright coloured specimens are all  females  and those which are purple I imagine are  males  I mentioned the circumstance to an eminent Entomologist and he at first suspected they might be mule Insects generated between the  C Betulae  and the  C Purpureus  but that could not be the case as they were all in copulation when taken  We have been the more minute in this account as we consider the confounding of one species with another should ever be avoided with as much care as the separation of varieties into distinct species both tend to confuse or subvert that truth which should be the guide of every enquirer into nature  I have received a letter from my respectable friend  T Marsham  Esq  Sec L S accompanied with a specimen of the green kind of  C Betulae  that is spinous on the thorax together with one of the blue or purple kind which is spinous also he informs me that though his purple specimen has spines he is very certain he has had one with∣out hence it appears to me that they admit of great variation indeed it would afford the most presumptive argument that there are males and females of both colours Among the purple specimens which I took there was a considerable difference in their colours but of the five green specimens scarcely two exactly agreed one in particular partook so much of a vivid crimson that it might easily have been mistaken by a cursory collector for the  Curculio Bachus  PLATE LXXV NOTONECTA GLAUCA

species is by far the most common of the Notonecta genus in  England  It is an aquatic Insect undergoes its several changes in the water and in the last state is furnished with wings for flight  In the daytime it may be observed on the surface of still waters it always swims on its back with its legs extended In the evening it flies in the air Found during most of the summer months Most authors have described the upper shells as being of a brown colour variegated with clouds of black but this appearance is not constant in every specimen they lose much of that colour after being taken out of the water or if the wings are expanded  PLATE LXXVI PHALAENA FUNALIS FESTOON MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae taper from the base Wings when at rest generally contracted Fly by night  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Upper wings orange rather inclining to brown with a black line nearly of a triangular form on each when the wings are expanded the lines resemble a festoon Under wings orange clouded and frosted with black margin pale  We are happy to present our Subscribers with the figure of a Moth which is scarcely known among the English Collectors and we may venture to assert on the best authority has not a place in any cabinet of Insects in this metropolis except that of the Author indeed the only person who appears to have been so fortunate as to meet with it except himself is Mr Lewin who formerly resided at Dartford he considered it as such an invaluable rarity that had not a figure of it been discovered in  Roesel  it would no doubt have been published in the Transactions of the Linnaean Society it must however be ob∣served that the Insect  Roesel  has figured is a foreign specimen  On the communication of Mr JONES of  Chelsea  we presume that this Insect was formerly known among the English Collectors and received from them the appellation  Festoon Moth  but it must have been extremely rare even at that time as it does not appear in Harris's List of English Moths nor has a single specimen or its remains been found among the old Collections which have been handed down to the Entomologists of the present day  On the th of August I shook the Caterpillar from one of the high branches of an oaktree in Darent wood Kent it remained motionless for some time when in the net and I concluded that it might have sustained an injury by its fall but I soon after discovered that it was naturally a sluggish inactive creature and had received no da∣mage it remained several days in the Caterpillar state but as it was almost ready to change into Chrysalis I had only an opportunity of being convinced that oak was its proper food  This Caterpillar is a most singular creature at one time it would flatten itself and be considerably extended in breadth or length at another time it would gather itself up like an hedgehog or become almost round and in a few minutes after it would be flat again and frequently the orange colour on the back would be obliterated some∣times it so nearly resembled the Caterpillars of several of the Papilio tribe that I suspected it to be one of the  Hairstreak Butterflies  or rather the Caterpillar of a new species On the d of August it began to spin and in a short time after its case was completed  The case in which it passed to the Pupa state was very firmly con∣structed and precluded an opportunity of observing the different symptoms of change which would otherwise have been visible This case which was exactly in the form of an egg was at first of a pale flesh colour but in the course of a few days it had heightened to a very fine sanguineous and after to a scarlet or nearly vermilion co∣lour this colour it retained for several months but as the time for the emancipation of the Moth within approached the brightness of  red somewhat abated though even after the Fly came forth much of the original colour remained  The manner in which it bursts open the case is rather singular it does not force an opening in an irregular form as most Insects which spin a case but describes an exact circle within at one end after this it divides its case according to that circle only leaving a small portion to act as an hinge when it has extricated itself from the Chrysalis it forces the top of the case back as shown in our Figure and thereby a free passage is opened for its delivery  The inside of the case is perfectly smooth and appears as if po∣lished by art it is of a pale blue colour the Chrysalis within is brown  The Fly came forth on the th of July  PLATE LXXVII  FIG I and FIG II PHALAENA CRISTALANA DARKBUTTON MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae taper from the base Wings in general contracted when at rest Fly by night  TORTRIX SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Upper wings yellowbrown with dark shades a broad irregular white mark and a tuft or button on the center of each Head and thorax white clouded Lower wings pale brown  This singular Moth is very rarely met with it has been taken in  Coombewood Surry  and in  Kent  but even in those places it is very uncommon  It is distinguished by the unusual form of the white markings on the upper wings and particularly by the tuft or button which is situated in an upright position near the center of each those tufts appear only slightly feathered on the upper parts to the naked eye but when one of them is examined with a microscope or even common magnifier it presents the appearance of a bundle of fibres inclosed within a thin membrane narrow at the base encreasing in bulk near the middle  and expanding at the summit into a number of shoots in the form of a crest several other tufts are dispersed near the extremities of the upper wings but they are not conspicuous to the naked eye  I have seen an Insect which corresponds in every respect with this specimen except that it had a line of a dull ochre colour along the posterior margins of the upper wings but I suspect it to be either a variety or perhaps only the difference of sex  Linnaeus  has not described this insect neither can we discover any description of it in the writings of  Fabricius  and I have no doubt of its being a nondescript species  The singular crested tufts with the white markings on the upper wings furnish such an ample specific distinction that we have named it  Cristalana  Found early in the month of  August  Fig I

rayed with a very dark purple from the base to the apex of each a white stripe near to and parallel with the posterior margin and two spots of the same colour near the center of each wing Second wings lead colour deeply fringed  This insect also appears to be a nondescript species we have called it  Radiatella  or rayed from the form of the dark stripes which rise from the base and spread in the form of rays to the apices of the up∣per wings It is very liable to change after death and particularly the buff colour which appears very bright when the insect is fresh but is sometimes so altered in appearance when placed in the cabinet that an intermixture of that colour can be scarcely distinguished between the rays of purple we mention this circumstance as very few small lepidopterous insects are subject to such alteration  It is found about the same time as the Phalaena Cristalana and I be∣lieve is equally scarce  Fig III represents the natural size Fig IV its magnified

death green changes to brown of various hues the light colours become dark and the dark colours fade so that no just idea of the true appearance can be formed except from the living insects  The larva and pupa of most species of the Gryllus genus scarcely differ in appearance from the perfect insect except that in the two first states they are apterous or without wings and either leap or walk but

state it is found crawling at the bot∣toms of pools or ditches and subsists on the larvae of Gnats and other Insects but in the last state it leaves its aquatic abode and subsists on small winged insects especially Moths it is not uncom∣mon to see one of this species stop short in its flight dart down like a Hawk upon a Moth or Butterfly and tear it to pieces in an instant or fly with it in its mouth to some more convenient place to devour it  PLATE LXXXII PHALAENA USTULARIA EARLY THORN MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae taper from the base Wings in general contracted when at

the several Moths of the  Geometrae  division of Phalenae which are known to the English Collectors by the trivial distinction  Thorn Moths  our present Insect is neither the most conspicuous or rare it is however a beautiful creature when taken immediately from the Pupa case but rarely fine when caught in the fly state in the fowlingnet the down being of such an exquisite texture that the slightest touch must inevitably damage its appearance  The Pupa is marked with a brown colour at every annulation im∣mediately after the Caterpillar has passed to that state but as the crea∣ture within becomes more perfect that brown is gradually changed to a dark or black colour  I have observed much variation in the colours of different specimens of this species of three male Insects which I have bred this season one only corresponded with the annexed figure one inclined much more to a red brown and the other to a dull purple  I met with the Caterpillars on the oak and they always preferred that food to any other The Caterpillars are small in July they pass to the Pupa state in Autumn and the Moths are to be taken about the middle of March  Although as we have just observed this Insect does not particularly claim our regard as a rarity it does not appear to have been described by  Linnaeus  or even by  Fabricius  in his Species Insectorum and no account of it is included in Berkenhout's Outlines in Harris's Cata∣logue of English Insects or any other work we have had an opportu∣nity of perusing  In its manners the Caterpillar is not more singular than in its form when young it is very active and in continual motion but as it grows larger it becomes more sluggish in its disposition it will some∣times affix itself by its hind feet to one of the extreme branches of the tree on which it feeds in the same manner as shewn in our plate and will remain in that posture several hours without the least apparent signs of life  PLATE LXXXIII CICADA CORNUTA HORNED CICADA

particularly it is very common it is as frequent in America as in Europe and is esteemed as a rarity only in this country it is indeed sometimes found in abundance with us but as its appearance is neither annual nor periodical it is generally valued by English Collectors  There have been several instances of this Insect being found in different parts of the country in mild seasons as plenty as the Pea∣cock or Admirable Butterflies in the summer of particularly they were as numerous in some places as the common garden White Butterfly is usually near London  But as a proof that its appearance does not altogether depend on the temperature of the weather we need only adduce that not a single specimen has been taken this season although it has been one of the most favourable for all kinds of Insects that can be recollected and many species of Moths and Butterflies which have not been seen for several years before have been taken at CombeWood DarnWood and similar adjacent parts during summer in plenty  It is from the uncertainty of its appearance that we have such dif∣ferent and seemingly irreconcileable accounts of the abundance and scarcity of this Butterfly it was certainly well known as a native of this country to former Collectors yet it received only a few years since the new name  Grand Surprise  this name which was given by Moses Harris or by some of the company of Aurelians of whose society he was a member was evidently intended as a significant expression of their admiration not of the beauty of the Insect but of the singular circumstance of the species remaining so long in those very places where the most diligent researches of preceding Collectors had been made in vain of their unwearied industry they were well persuaded and were therefore unable to account for the appearance of a numerous brood of large Insects which must have remained concealed many years or been lately transported to those places  Harris in his Aurelian calls it the Camberwell Beauty though in his list of English Butterflies HawkMoths and Moths he uses the name  Grand Surprise  we mention this circumstance as it appears very inconsistent that the new name he adopts in one work and the  old one he should have discarded in the other are equally and indis∣criminately used in the several editions of both we still find it in the Aurelian  "Camberwell Beauty"  in the other  "Grand Surprise"  from which it might be readily inferred that he meant two distinct Insects were it not for the addition of the Linnaean name  Pap Antiopa  In the general description of this Insect in the Aurelian Harris does not say that it was scarce at that time which he certainly would if it had been so but Berkenhout in his outlines of Natural History adds after its specific character that it is  very rare in this kingdom  To reconcile those accounts we can only ob∣serve that no Insect is more uncertain as to the time of its appear∣ance that though found in abundance in one season it may not be seen in the next or even for several successive years it will then ap∣pear in small or large quantities for one two or more seasons and again disappear for many years as before  The English specimens differ from those of other countries in the colour of the light exterior border of the wings in the former that part is of a very pale yellow brown inclining to a dirty white in the latter it is of a deep yellow marked and spotted with brown  Fabri∣cius  notices this difference and says they are varieties  The Caterpillars feed on the Willow and are generally found on the highest branches they cast their skin early in  July  and pass to the Chrysalis as represented in the plate The underside of the But∣terfly is of a black brown with irregular dark streaks the yellowish border is visible on that side  PLATE XC PHAELAENA LOEFLINGIANA LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae taper from the base Wings in general contrasted when at rest Fly by night  TORTRIX

we have and if we omit the Sp Porcellus Lineata Atropos with a very few others we have no indigenous species that can by any means be compared with it as a rare or we may add beautiful Insect  Drury  has given a figure of the Sphinx without its changes among his rare Insects but as a native of a foreign country and before the time of  Harris  it was frequently an object of discussion among Aure∣lians whether it ever had been taken in  England Harris  in his work expresses himself thus  It has been long in dispute whether the Spotted Elephant was a native of this island but it is now past a doubt as I have had the good fortune to find a Caterpillar of this Moth in marshy ground at  Barnscray  near  Crayford  in  Kent  about the middle of  August    it was better than three inches long of a dark brown colour the horn at the tail part which was about half an inch long appeared long and glossy The head was nearly the size of a small pea of a lightish yellow brown or tan colour I tried various herbs to bring it to feed but my attempts were fruit∣less and it died for want  It seeds on plants of the  Euphorbia  genus as its specific name indicates  The Chrysalis in the plate was sent me from  Belleisle  in  France  and the Moth was produced from it about the beginning of  June    Harris  's  Aurelian  plate  We are not informed of more than two similar circumstances that may place its existence in this country beyond dispute a damaged specimen of the Fly has been taken at  Bath  and is in our cabinet and Mr  Curtis  author of the  Flora Londinensis  c found four of the Caterpillars last summer in  Devonshire  In the Caterpillar state it frequently changes its skin and appears as frequently to alter its appearance we cannot else account for the dissimilarity that prevails among all the coloured representations of the Insect in that state that have come under our inspection in Roesel's Hist Ins we find a figure of the Caterpillar apparently in the last skin  that very nearly corresponds with our specimen but that figured by Harris does not agree with either in the form or number of the spots At an early stage of its growth the Caterpillar according to Roesel is bright yellow with black patches and minute white specks  The figure in plate XCII is copied from a most perfect specimen of the Caterpillar and which is now in our possession but as we cannot assure our Subscribers that it was found in  England  we have been careful to add it in a separate plate that so it may either be in∣cluded in the volume with the Sphinx and Pupa or be excluded

considered as the effect of chance or design on a single Insect if we did not observe that character prevail through every specimen we find two kinds of them in several cabinets in London and we are in possession of a third that differs from either  By most practical Entomologists they have been considered as dis∣tinct species and they may be such but as we are unwilling to create confusion by extending the number of species we prefer admitting them as varieties under the Fabrician name EmarganaWe are more readily inclined to adopt this measure as we have always found them at the same time of the year in the same parts of the woods and generally sporting together which is not commonly observed of Insects that are not either varieties or differ only in sex  They are rarely met with our specimens were taken in June at DartfordThey have been taken together at CaenWood Hamp∣stead  They have not been described by Linnaeus but were known among Collectors by the now obsolete name Excavana  At Fig is shewn one of the varieties the third is much yellower but marked with similar reticulated strokes and exactly corresponds in size and form with this figure  FIG II PHALAENA ZOËGANA
