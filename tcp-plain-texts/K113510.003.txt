 OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE  VOL III  THE VIEW OF INDIA EXTRA GANGEM CHINA AND JAPAN  BY THOMAS PENNANT ESQ  VOL III  LONDON  Printed by Luke Hansard Great Turnstile Lincoln'sInn Fields  AND SOLD BY JOHN WHITE HORACE'S HEAD FLEETSTREET  MDCCC  ADVERTISEMENT  THE sad duty of publishing the posthumous works of a revered Parent having devolved on me I now present the Public with two volumes of the continuation of the "OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE" which comprehend a view of the interesting countries of China Japan New Holland and the Archipelago of the Indian Ocean  As an editor my chief care has been to transcribe with accuracy from the original manuscript The finishing touch of the master may be wanting but the hand alas which gave the glowing tint is now cold and who shall dare to usurp the pencil Some trifling additions distinguished by an initial have been made by myself and to  John Latham  Esquire I am indebted for an augmentation to the catalogue of Birds of China and of New Holland  An objection may be made by some that no plates adorn these volumesengravings except of novel objects or really illustrative and such notwithstanding much exertion it was not my good fortune to procure tend little to the value of a work of science Two maps presumed more requisite have been constructed from the best materials  The biography of the valued Author of the following sheets having been given by himself in his "Literary Life" to the commencement of the year little remains for me to add To that period his health and felicity had experienced little interruption the illness of an amiable daughter then began to embitter his days and after the most unremitting attention that parental fondness could dictate he felt the cruel pang of separation on the first of May this shock his spirits never completely recovered In the April of the ensuing year the patella of the knee snapped while descending a flight of steps an accident which confined him long to his room yet notwithstanding his advanced age and the bones never again reuniting he recovered  sufficiently not only to walk without difficulty but to pursue his usual exercise on horseback  The year gave to the world his "Account of the parishes of Whitford and Holywell" The infirmities of nature now began to shew themselves more evidently The loss of a friend and neighbor the worthy Sir  Roger Mostyn  the subsequent distractions of the county of Flint by jarring politics the melancholy situation of public affairs the progress of Gallic barbarism which threatened to overturn all institutions social and sacred operated too forcibly on a mind of the acutest feeling and most exquisite sensibility Mental agitation affected the corporeal system a difficulty of breathing a cough and other pulmonary affections induced him to apply for medical aid and he received from his friend Dr  Haygarth  then resident at Chester all the assistance that art could give Considerable discharges of blood from the nose increased the alarming symptoms still the energy of his mind sustained itself he continued his literary pursuits and employed his leisure hours during the  greatest part of in preparing for the press and rendering as perfect as possible his interesting "VIEW OF HINDOOSTAN" which was published early in the following year OEdematous swellings in the legs announced the fatal cause of his disease but to expatiate more minutely on the sad catalogue of human evils might be irksome suffice it then to say that he bore their trial with fortitude and resignation a natural strength of constitution aided by a life of uniform temperance enabled him long to struggle against infirmity The progress of the disorder becoming more rapid towards the close of October he collected his nearest relatives and received with them the mysterious seal of our Redemption conscious of his approaching end his eye beamed with hope tempered by the most serene and dignified resignation combining charity with devotion he observed that the ceremony would be incomplete indeed were it not accompanied by an act of beneficence to the poor This was the last duty of religion he performed his life had been a preparation for the aweful conclusion  Though soon after reduced to the inability of moving and suffering much he continued to share the conversation of his friends and relations except during the extreme pressure of pain or when opiates employed to procure a disturbed sleep or relieve the body from a few pangs produced their powerful effect and sacrificed the reasoning powers and the nobler faculties of the soul On the th of December the powers of nature were exhausted and the venerated author of my being expired without a groan  The pen of a son may not be calculated to record the character of an affectionate and beloved parent the bias of natural affection may operate too forcibly yet the silence of the person most intimately acquainted with the various virtues of  Thomas Pennant  would justly draw down the reproach of ingratitude  His religious principles were pure and fervent yet exempt from bigotry though firmly attached to the established church he by his writings and conduct conciliated the esteem of those of a different persuasion A steady  friend to our excellent constitution he ever labored to preserve it entire this induced him to petition for the reform of some abuses during the administration of Lord  North  at a period when the influence of the crown was supposed to have exceeded its due bounds this brought him forward in later times with additional energy to resist the democratic spirit which menaced tenfold evils The duties of a magistrate he exercised with candor with a temperate yet zealous warmth to protect the oppressed His benevolence to the poor was unbounded his repeated exertions to relieve the wants of a populous neighbourhood by the importation of corn in times of scarcity were truly munificent Temperate in diet he enjoyed the fruits of abstinence and until a few years previous to his decease possessed an unusual share of health and vigor His conversation was lively replete with instruction and brilliant with sallies of true humour yet too great sensiblity at times lowered his natural flow of spirits and occasioned severe dejection  Of his literary character the public is the impartial judge and that public not only in this but in foreign countries has fixed on it the stamp of approbation Blessed with a memory the most retentive his powers of composition were rapid his works were generally printed as they flowed from the pen with little or no correction hence some inaccuracies may be expected but their numbers are trifling  Such candid Reader is the true but imperfect sketch of the character of a man who to superior talents united the utmost goodness of heart  Accept sainted spirit this unavailing tribute of filial duty May the example of thy virtues stimulate my exertions May my latter end resemble thine  DAVID PENNANT  DOWNING  April    ITINERARY  KINGDOM of Aracan Page  River ibid  Kingdom of Ava Page  River Ava Page  Lake of Chiamay ibid  Ava City Page  Lundsey Page  Chedubah Isle

GLOBE Vol III  map  INDIA EXTRA GANGEM  I NOW enter on that portion of  India  which is distinguished by the name of  India  beyond the  Ganges  The distinction is comparatively modern being known to the antients in an imperfect manner Here and there are scattered a few names which they could only have collected from the  Indian  navigators but I shall mention in course any other lights which I discover they might have received  ADJOINING to  Chittigong  is the kingdom of  Aracan  KINGDOM OF ARACAN  which extends along the bay of  Bengal  about two hundred miles in a southeastern direction According to Mr  Rennel  's map a chain of mountains beginning in the southern part of  Chittigong  skirts the sea the whole length of this kingdom as well as that of  Ava  to within a few leagues of  Cape Negrais  The whole tract is infested to a very great degree with elephants and beasts of prey The topography of this country is very obscure The mouth of the river  Aracan  the  Tocosannae  of  Ptolemy  RIVER  is placed in Lat ° ′ M  D'Anville  gives its whole course Mr  Rennel  more cautious and perhaps conscious of the uncertainty only  delineates a small part  ARACAN  or from the capital  Aracan  to the sea From  Aracan  as high as Lat ° with the exception of a small portion between  Malaac  and  Munnypour  where it is traversed by the great communication from  Ava  to the northern parts of  Bengal  it is marked with a dotted line from that point the river is distinguished by a certain course which is continued northward in the kingdom of  Thibet  as high as Lat ° ′ All the great tract it passes through is level which makes it liable to annual inundations from the same causes as affect the  Bengal  and other of the  Indian  plains The tides which run up this river are very high they come in with a great bore and rise from fifteen to twenty feet according to the influence of the moon  THERE is six fathom water according to Mr  Ovington  's account at the entrance of the river and twenty farther up so that it forms a noble harbour From the mouth to the capital is about fifty miles most of the way deliciously bounded by woods or plantations animated by the gambols of the monkey tribe or the gay flights of numbers of peacocks The city of  Aracan  is seated most singularly in a valley surrounded with vast and craggy mountains These are assisted by art so as to prove the most substantial fortifications The entrances are cut through the solid rock as are the gates of the city The precipitous face of the mountains serves for walls besides these it has a citadel and other artificial defences The city is said to be fifteen miles in circumference and to contain a hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants The regal palace is very magnificent and highly adorned and enriched with works of massive gold  IN my  Outlines of the Globe vol ii p  account of  Chittigong  in the preceding volume I have related the share this kingdom took in the affairs of  Hindoostan  by reason of the support it gave the  Portuguese  pirates I shall now take notice of a very remarkable event which befel  Aracan  the result of the misfortunes of  Sultan Sujah  OF SULTAN SULJAH  the second son of the emperor  Shah Jehan  and the unfortunate brother of that successful hypocrite  Aurengzebe  After  Sujah  had long made head against the usurper he was at length obliged to retire from his fastness near  Monghier  to  Dacca  and from thence to the kingdom of  Aracan  He had previously sent his son to the king of the country to implore his protection This was immediately promised and the unhappy prince embarked with his whole family on board the vessels of the  Portuguese  pirates settled in the mouths of the  Ganges  intending to profit of the favor of the infidel monarch till he could procure a ship to convey him to the holy city of  Mecca  From thence he intended to go to the courts of  Turky  or  Persia  in hopes of an asylum in one or other of the dominions of those mighty potentates  Sujah  is said soon to have discovered the perfidy of his royal host who had entered into a treaty with the General of  Aurengzebe  to deliver into his hands for a sum of money the fugitive sultan This came to the ears of that prince who rashly determined on revenge He entered into a conspiracy against the  Aracan  monarch gained over a certain number of  Mahometans  resident in the country and with those and the few who were left of his train resolved to force his way into the palace to kill the king and cause himself to be proclamed sovereign  All this might have been executed  ARACAN  had not the design been discovered The unhappy  Sujah  attempted to escape towards  Pegu  he was soon overtaken His son sultan  Banque  defended himself with a courage worthy of his birth till overpowered with numbers and fainting under his wounds he was seized and with his two little brothers his sisters and his mother carried away As to  Sujah  he with one woman an eunuch and two other persons in ascending a mountain was knocked down with a stone by his pursuers The eunuch bound up his wounded head with a turban and they both escaped into the woods Many relations were spread respecting this event In general he was supposed to have died either famished with hunger or fallen a prey to wild beasts Mr  Dalrymple  had picked up a story that  Sujah  escaped to  Soolo  an isle between that of  Borneo  and  Magindanao  where he long led an eremitical life that he died there and that a tomb was erected over his grave to this day an object of veneration with the  Mahometans  THE tragical relation does not end here Sultan  Banque  and other fugitives who were brought back were at first treated with a tolerable degree of lenity the king even took to wife one of  Sujah  's daughters This did not prevent  Banque  and his companions from entering into another conspiracy which was detected The king of  Aracan  determined to root out this illfated family he caused the heads of the men to be cut off with blunt axes the women to be immured and starved to death the lady alone whom he had honored with his bed was saved  THE great quantity of gold and diamonds which had been brought into the country by  Sujah  proved the cause of dreadful  wars between the two sons of the king of  Aracan  who succeeded him in they quarrelled about the division of the treasure and never ceased from contesting the prize till both the competitors were destroyed Many of the diamonds as is supposed were afterwards sold to the  Dutch  who happened to touch at  Aracan  at very low prices by reason of the ignorance of the possessors  THE next kingdom is that of  Ava  KINGDOM OF AVA  I shall comprehend in it three that of  Ava  proper  Buraghmah  or as it is vulgarly called  Burmah  and  Pegu  They once formed so many independent states governed by their respective monarchs but are now by conquest consolidated into one being subdued by the king of  Burmagh  His dominions extend from the province of  Yunan  in  China  as far south as the mouths of the  Ava  a tract of eight hundred miles The standard of  Mahomet  was never erected in these kingdoms all the inhabitants are rank idolaters their mode of worship and their rites agree in many points with those of the  Hindoos  and they allow the doctrine of transmigration Their pagodas and those of  Pegu  very much resemble in form that of a bell tent The more northern part is the kingdom of  Burmagh  that of  Meckly  tributary to it forms on our maps a large vacant space to the west divided by a vast chain of mountains from  Silhet  and  Tipera Roshuan  another void is to the south of  Meckly  The kingdom of  Aracan  separates  Burmagh  for a considerable extent from the eastern part of the bay of  Bengal  The coast of  Ava  succeeds and runs washed by the sea as far as  Cape Negrais  an extent of above two hundred miles  THE great river  Ava  takes its rise far beyond the province of  Yunan  RIVER AVA  in  China  and as is supposed in  Thibet  The  Chinese  call it  Houkian  I am uncertain where it becomes navigable possibly at the last customhouse in the  Chinese  dominions at least we find that four people of that nation with some others embarked there on a voyage made in the last century down that river We have an account of it in vol vii of the  Universal History  It is described even at the customhouse as a large and rapid river They were twenty days in sailing to the city of  Ava  and a month more from thence to  Pegu  Below the capital of the kingdom the vessels which navigate this mighty river are said to be as large as our biggest ships without sail but the planks have neither peg or nail to fasten them they seem to be sewed like the Arabian vessels which will be described in vol of this work  MR DALRYMPLE in p of his useful Repertory says he is assured that the river passes through a great lake not far above the city of  Ava  This lake in the old maps such as  Speed  's  LAKE OF CHIAMAY  is called  Chiamay  and it is supposed that the rivers of  Siam  and possibly of  Aracan Chittigong  and some others flow out of it The river is described as difficult of navigation by reason of ripplings and overfalls and its water during the inundations very cold occasioned by the snowy mountains from whence it flows  THE borders of the  Ava  after it enters  Burmagh  are in some parts flat in others hilly but in none so low as to be overflowed The neighbouring grounds are replete with saltpetre and quantities of common salt are procured by lixiviation from  a black earth which abounds in this district It is now called the  Irabathy Munchaboo  the royal residence of the king of  Burmagh  stands about twelve miles from the western bank in Lat ° ′ a walled town of a square form containing four thousand families  Ava  the capital of the kingdom of the same name  AVA CITY  is seated in Lat ° ′ on the eastern bank of the river about miles below  Munchaboo  It is a very large city built of wood the streets strait and planted on each side with trees The king's palace alone is of stone but mean in its architecture It was in the sixteenth century prodigiously populous but was laid waste by the king of  Pegu  in the most savage manner  Purchas  Vol ii  gives the horrible relation The jewellers of  Europe  visited it in the same century for the sake of its rich gems At present  Ava  is in a most ruinous state and does not contain above a thousand families The kingdom produces sapphires and rubies of the highest quality Mention is made of its rich mines of copper lead and silver Other provinces are rich in gold  FROM the city the river assumes the same name of  Ava  takes a small curvature from thence towards the west and the channel becomes full of isles Near  Pegongmew  a town seated in a sterile sandy country and which from the remains of numerous pagodas seems formerly to have been a place of importance the  Ava  takes a more southerly course Between Lat ° and ° north  TEEK WOODS  the western side is filled with an immense forest of teek trees which is said to produce the best timber of any in  India  it is floated down the river and is a considerable article of commerce  Prone  once enclosed with fortifications lies on the left bank and is one of the principal trading towns on its course the environs are extremely fertile  AT  Lundsey  LUNDSEY  a town seated on the eastern bank in Latitude ° ′ begins a rich fat soil formed by the mud brought down by the great annual inundations which this river is subject to like the  Ganges Lundsey  is distant a hundred and eighty miles from the sea The  Delta  of the  Ava  begins in about Lat ° and extends nearly a hundred and forty miles before it reaches the southern extremity the base or the lower part facing the sea is about two hundred miles all the upper part of the  Delta  is clear land the lower seems filled with wood and divided by a number of channels into islands like the  Sunderbund  of the  Ganges  Ptolemy  calls the river  Ava Sabaracus  That able geographer  D'Anville  mistakes it for the  Burrampooter  and accordingly we find it under that name in his maps The error is venial for he did not live to the time of our  Rennel  I SHALL now resume the coasts from the borders of  Chittigong  COASTS  The country abounds with timber and the woods with all sorts of animals for food such as buffaloes deer and wild hogs Here and there a few isles are dispersed along the shore some in groups  ISLES  others single or few together The isles are  St Martin  's not far above the mouth of  Aracan  river the  Oyster  islands nearly opposite and the  Bolongo  a very little to it's south  CHEDUBAH ISLE  Chedubah  a large island in about Lat ° ′ is supposed to be the  Bazacuta  of  Ptolemy  remarkable says he for the quantity of shells he adds that the inhabitants were called  Agmatae  and that they went naked The  Sada Civitas  is placed on the coast of  Ava  by M  D'Anville  in Lat ° We are little acquainted with the country but that able geographer discovers it to have been a place still known by the name of  Sadoa  Near it was the  Sadus Fluvius Berabonna  was another town of  Ptolemy  's seated on the same coast in Lat ° ′ now called  Barabon  and at the extremity of the southern side of  Ava  is  Cape Negrais  in about Lat °  CAPE NEGRAIS  the antient  Promontorium Temula  From Mr  Baker  's survey in Mr  Dalrymple  's collection it appears to be lofty and in part very precipitous The isle of  Negrais  and another both off the mouth of the river form within them a noble harbor secure from all winds The  English  of late years wished to six here a settlement The country is incredibly fertile in rice and might have proved a fine resource to the  Coromandel  coast and even to  Bengal  in times of scarcity exclusive of the advantages to be derived from the harbor in time of war As to rice it is sold here at twelve pagodas a garce whereas in  Coromandel  it is generally above thirty and sometimes even eighty a garce  THE kingdom of  Pegu  begins at this cape  PEGU  the coast turns then suddenly to the east and extends above two hundred miles inclining after some way slightly to the north as far as the river of  Martaban  the boundary between  Pegu  and the province of  Martaban  which adjoins to the kingdom of  Siam Pegu  is extremely narrow at the part next to  Cape Negrais  but it widens quickly so as to take in the whole  Delta  of the  Ava  and stretches north as high as Lat ° In the maps the coast of  Ava  is comprehended in the kingdom of  Pegu  We know so little of these  countries of their revolutions and contrarevolutions that we dare not deny our assent to or controvert the relations of writers  THE great branch of the  Delta  is immediately to the east of  Cape Negrais  It is called the  Persaim  river from a town seated about seventy miles from the sea on its eastern banks In we had a factory on the opposite side The channel is very wide and deep having most of the way six and seven fathoms of water On each side are navigable canals that probably insulate part of the flat country to the east and to the west On the eastern part there is an inland communication from this river quite to that of  Pegu  or the  Siriam  river as there is through the  Sunderbunds  of  Bengal  ISLE OF NEGRAIS  Negrais  isle marshy and wooded lies just within the entrance and on the outside is  Diamond  isle small and surrounded with rocks Immediately before the front of the whole  Delta  are banks of mud or sand of great extent formed by the waters of the  Ava  depositing their foul load before the mouths of the several discharges The  Marcura Metropolis  of  Ptolemy  stood in about the middle of the  Delta  and must have had its navigable approach I do not know that any of the discharges are at present useful in navigation like the channels between the islands of the  Sunderbunds  till we reach the entrance of that which leads to the town of  Siriam  This known by the name of the  Siriam  SIRIAM  is a branch of the river of  Pegu  and contributes to form another  Delta  The town is about thirty miles from the entrance near it are factories belonging to the  French English  and  Dutch Raynal  Hist of Europ Set vol ii p  says that the  Armenians  carry on a great trade in topazes sapphires amethysts  and rubies The river was known to  Ptolemy  by the title of  Besynga  and gave its name to the modern river of  Pegu  THE other exports of  Pegu  are teek timber elephants ivory  EXPORTS  beeswax lac iron tin indigo oil from different woods oil of earth or  Naptha  and of fish Here are mines of gold and silver but neither of these are worked The iron is native and found in masses of fifteen or twenty pounds weight and ready for the manufacturer also plenty of sulphur and saltpetre but the exportation of the last is most strictly prohibited Rice is cultivated in great abundance in the low lands of the country but no attention is paid to any sort of manufactures except that of cotton for home consumption  I MAY observe  BEES  that the bees of the torrid zone are the same with the  European  there being only one species producing honey which is the  Apis Mellifica  No attempts are made either in  India  or the hotter parts of  Africa  to hive these admirable and useful insects they inhabit the hollows of trees from which their treasures are taken  LAC is the production of another insect a species of  Chermes  LAC  undescribed by  Linnaeus  Doctor  Roxburgh  a naturalist now rising in  Hindoostan  gives us an account of its operations in the Philosophical Transactions  Vol lxxxi p tab vi  under the name of  Chermes Lacca  This like the bee forms cells pentagons hexagons and irregular squares which at  Samulcotta  in  Orixa  the Doctor's residence are affixed to the branches of the  Mimosa Cinerea  the  Mimosa Glauca  of  Koenig  and a new species called by the  Gentoos Conda Corinda  The insects are very small they  first appear issuing out of the cells sixlegged and wingless and are amazingly active and lively each cell contains about a hundred the eggs they proceed from are lodged in the cells in a deepred liquor These are the females The males are winged and are not in proportion to the females more than one to five thousand but they are four or five times their size The eggs and the liquor they are lodged in give a most beautiful red Doctor  Roxburgh  acknowleges that the subject from which the materials of the cells is collected is as yet unknown  LAC is brought over to  Europe  in three forms adhering to the sticks with the cells and insects prepared in form of cakes or in small grains or seed  lac  which is the insect advanced into a  pupa  state This drug was once used in medicine in disorders of the gums proceeding from colds or scorbutic habits but the uses are now confined to the making of sealing wax or for dying  Gerard  P  gives a figure of a stick of the tree and the  lac  adhering and supposes it to be the  Luchs  of  Avicen  the  Cancamum  of  Dioscorides  Pegu  imports from  Bengal  great quantities of  Indian  goods  IMPORTS  and some  European  especially hats The coco palm does not grow in  Pegu  the nut is therefore a considerable import  Dampier  shipped eleven thousand and five or six hundred pounds weight of sugar as presents for the king  THE river of  Pegu  arises in the province of  Yunan  RIVER OF PEGU  in  China  passes through the upper part of the kingdom of  Siam  and forces its way through a great chain of mountains in about Lat ° ′ which run from north to east dividing  Siam  from  Pegu  here it assumes the name of that kingdom  CITY  The capital city  stands on the eastern bank in about Lat ° ′ In its prosperity it consisted of two parts the old and the new the last was the royal residence and completed about the year by  Mandaragri  the second  Burmagh  king A tyrant monarch arose who oppressed his subjects to such a degree as to encourage the neighboring princes to invade his dominions and in he was besieged by them in his capital The  Portuguese  in conjunction with certain Turks caused the siege to be raised but out of a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants only thirty thousand were left all the others perished either by the sword or famine it had at that time three thousand cannon for its defence of which one thousand were brass The kings of  Aracan  and  Tangu  took advantage of his distress the city was again besieged surrendered to the latter and the unfortunate monarch and his whole family put to death by order of his own sister queen to the victorious king the place was foon deserted and the seat of empire transferred to  Ava  The city of  Pegu  was of vast size a regular square with four grand streets leading to four gates and being seated on a plain a person at the center could see them all at once though the city was a mile each way The houses were built with bamboo it was surrounded with walls and a deep wet ditch stocked with crocodiles  CROCODILES  to prevent people attempting to get in or out of the city by swimming or wading  THE bore or head wave of the tide  BORE OR HEAD WAVE  which runs up this river is of amazing violence and rapidity people who have the misfortune of being shipwrecked on the banks near the shore at low water or ebb of tide are obliged to seek the land with all possible speed for fear lest they should be swept away On its entering  the channels and the mouths of rivers the noise is most tremendous The bore is said to be sixteen feet high the barks which run up the  Pegu  river are carried with the rapidity of an arrow out of a bow If they cannot finish their voyage in a tide they anchor on some of the numerous sand banks with which the river is filled The expansion of the tide on those elevated parts lessens the danger as soon as the barks begin to be lifted up they prepare for their voyage At a certain time the mariners loosen their anchors and are carried on as I describe If they or even the largest ships lay in the channel they would certainly be overset and the crew and the cargo at once overwhelmed in the wave for this reason large ships seldom venture to navigate this river but discharge their lading at  Siriam  from whence it was wont to be conveyed to  Pegu  in barks  THE  Portuguese  very soon got considerable interest in this country but by their profligate conduct were expelled by the reigning monarch  SYLVEIRA HIS SAD FATE  One  Thomas Sylveira  had by his valor done considerable service to the king in the  Siamese  wars he became a prime favorite had his state elephant and bodyguard allowed till one day passing through the streets and hearing the mirth of nuptial merriment in a burgher's house stopped at the door and understanding that the bride was a virgin of uncommon beauty requested a sight of her the bridegroom thinking it an extraordinary honor brought her to the side of  Sylveira  's elephant the russian caused her to be seized and carried to his house The unhappy bridegroom unable to sustain his loss cut his throat the relations rent their cloaths and ran through the streets appealing to their gods and monarch for revenge The king heard the complaint caused  Sylveira  to be seized and  to be dragged at the foot of an elephant through the streets till neither skin or flesh were left on his bones and all the  Portuguese  in  Pegu  except the few who could escape by flight were instantly massacred  THE last great mouth of the  Pegu  river is the  Sitang  SITANG RIVER  it divides the kingdom of  Pegu  from the province of  Martaban  MARTABAN  The city of that name was for some time a royal residence and had once been the capital of an independent monarchy but was attacked and taken by the king of  Ava  who murdered the sovereign massacred the inhabitants and reduced the place to ashes After this  Hamilton  Account of the East Indies vol ii p  says that the conqueror sunk large vessels loaden with stones at the mouth of the port which was once a fine harbor so that at present only small ships can enter It had formerly been the most flourishing commercial town of the East and still retains its potteries and manufactures jars glazed with lead ore large enough to contain two hogsheads  Hamilton  also mentions its fisheries and adds that its dried mullets exceed in delicacy all fish of the kind  FROM the mouth of the  Martaban  harbor the course runs due south as far as the isle of  Junkseilon  ISLE OF JUNKSEILON  an extent of above five hundred miles The coast of  Martaban  takes in about a hundred and forty of the computation the currents along the shore are most swift and violent the country bordering on the sea little known and very barbarous It is skirted with small isles and is full of danger  THE natives of the kingdom of  Pegu  NATIVES OF PEGU  resemble the  Malays  in appearance and disposition but are more industrious Their  masters the  Buraghmahs  are liker to the  Arabs  in their features and of a darker complexion than the  Peguers  they are much addicted to commerce and so numerous even in  Pegu  as to exceed the natives as to They tattow themselves and by rubbing in gunpowder the marks become permanent the men are stout made they paint their thighs in graceful flourishes  THE lower  Siam  LOWER SIAM  part of the great kingdom of  Siam  begins in Lat ° ′  TOWN OF MERGUI  The town of  Mergui  stands on an island in the mouth of the river  Tenasserim  in Lat ° ′ it was once a most flourishing emporium till it was by the tyranny of the government almost totally deserted and the whole neighborhood became the habitation of wild beasts  Mergui  was at the close of the last century much frequented by the  English  free merchants but they were recalled by the  East India  company They likewise had a fort here now in ruins During the inundations there is a passage from  Mergui  to  Juthia  or the capital of  Siam  which may at that season be performed the greatest part of the way on rafts in three weeks but in the dry season the passage takes twice the time The river runs several leagues due east and after it has passed the city of  Tenasserim  turns to the north and keeps for a vast length of way towards its origin which is said to be in  China  The river and the town of  Mergui  were the  Daona  of  Ptolemy  and the city of  Tenasserim  the  Berobe  A GREAT chain of mountains divides the kingdom of  Siam  in two it begins to the east of  Tenasserim  and pointing north passes through the kingdom of  Ava  continues its course through  China  and probably unites with those of  Thibet  and even  Tartary  Mergui  stands opposite to the center of the Archipelago of the same name a most numerous group of isles  ARCHIPELAGO OF MERGUI  beginning in about Lat ° ′ and reaching as low as Lat ° ′ and in length stretching along the coast a hundred and thirty miles from north to south and from thirty to fifteen miles distant from the continent the channel has all the way good soundings good anchorage and regular tides which on the springs rise to twelve feet Captain  Thomas Forrest  in took a most accurate survey of these islands and proved the advantage of a knowlege of the channel between them and the main land At p p i ii of his preface he shews how our  Indiamen  may in their way to  Europe  save the hazard of being embayed and losing their passage by taking this route and by getting round  Atcheen  head in  Sumatra  proceed to  Europe  ALL the isles are mountanous and may be seen in clear weather at the distance of fourteen or fifteen leagues and most of them finely wooded many of the trees are very lofty among them is the  Poon tree  or  Uvaria Altissima  so useful for masts and the  Coco  palm of such universal use in all parts of  India  In  Pegu  the nut is esteemed a necessary of life nearly as much as rice  THE islands are of various sizes and forms but generally very small many exactly of the shape of a beehive and clothed with woods a few are very rocky and so rudely broken as to seem flung up by a mighty convulsion such are the rocks called the  Cupelo  The largest isles are  St Mathews St Susannas  and  Sullivans  or the  Domel  Among them are some very good harbors particularly  Hastings  Bay in the isle of  St Mathew  HASTINGS BAY  Mr  Forrest  proposed a settlement to be formed of the natives of  Hindoostan  on some of the islands in order to profit by the rich commerce of  Pegu  He says slate and marble are found here and that there is plenty of coral to burn into lime He adds  Swallow  i e a sort of  Actinia  in great request in  China  as a delicacy and also the edible birds nests  ABOUT a hundred and fifty leagues to the west of the most eastern part of the  Archipelago  of  Mergui  are the greater and lesser islands of  Andaman  ISLANDS OF ANDAMAN  Ptolemy  calls the first  Insulae Bonae Fortunae  perhaps says M  D'Anville  because navigators might exult at escaping from shores infamous for being inhabited by a barbarous  Anthropophagi  The antient name of the lesser  Andaman  was  Maniole  All the islands even as far as the group off the west end of  Sumatra  labored under the same scandal  THE great  Andaman  is about a hundred and eight miles long and extends from north to south between Lat ° ′ and ° ′ it is nearly of the same breadth or between thirty and forty miles The mountains rise rude and lofty that called the  Saddleback  is seen twentytwo leagues distance at sea By Captain  Wragg  's view there appears a considerable bay on the western side with a fine river running into the southern part this is the island which  Marco Polo  calls  Angania  and says that the inhabitants live like wild beasts on fruits and also human flesh and that they have heads and teeth like dogs but that their island abounds with fruits and all sorts of perfumes The  Bramins  say that these isles are inhabited by devils incarnate animated by the souls of impious men In respect to the teeth of the inhabitants it may be in some measure true for in many  parts of the Eastern world the natives are used to file their teeth into the form of those of the canine species  Frederic Caesar  a traveller of authority  Purchas ii  sailed by these islands about the year he made the same report of their barbarity and adds that they refuse all commerce with strangers and have small barks with which they attack and take any vessels they can master and kill and eat the prisoners  Caesar  met with two of their barks having on board nuts and fruit they refused money and were prevaled on to exchange some of their fruits for old rags but could not be induced by any means to come on board  Hamilton  Vol ii  speaks of them as a fearless people that they will swim off to any boat which approaches their island and attack it with their wooden weapons in defiance of numbers of our musquetry and of the missive and defensive weapons of iron and steel They annually make an excursion in their  preos  or little barks to their neighbors of the  Nicobar  isles and kill and take prisoners all they can The  Nicobarians  are a quiet people but once they took courage and collecting their force gave battle and totally defeated their barbarous enemies The same writer from the report of a native who had been taken prisoner when young by some  Nicobarians  and was converted to Mahometanism made frequent voyages to his native islands and often returned with four or five hundred weight of quicksilver with which he said they abounded  THE whole of the greater  Andaman  is skirted with small islands Mr  Dalrymple  makes mention of a cluster inhabited by  men most savage in their appearance quite black and with woolly hair like the  African Caffres  their noses not so flat for in feature they resemble the  Malays  they go naked have canoes and use one end of their paddle as a bow to shoot with  AT a great distance from the eastern side are the  Barren  Isle and the isle of  Narcondra  a vast mountain rising out of the sea a landmark from which ships take their departure  ABOUT twelve leagues due south from the greater  LESSER ANDAMAN  is the lesser  Andaman  in length twentysix miles a place known only by name  Carn Nicobar  CARN NICOBAR BARUSSAE INS ANTHROPOPH  is a flat island a hundred miles to the south of the lesser  Andaman  nearly five miles broad and very fertile in all the tropical fruits rich in grass and has plenty of cattle and hogs This island furnishes  Pegu  with abundance of coco nuts which are carried there by the  English French  and  Portuguese  The  Nicobar  isles extend  NICOBAR ISLANDS  at no great distances from each other to the south  SINDAE INS ANTHROPOPH  with an inclination to the east The middle group consists of fine champaign land and is called the  Sombrera  from the resemblance of a hill on one of them to a sombrera or umbrella  Carn Nicobar  lies in Lat ° ′ the southern point of the greatest  Nicobar  the more southern of the series is in Lat ° ′ this and the adjacent isles are mountanous This group was called by  Ptolemy Insulae Sindae  and the  Sombrera Barussae  we are made tolerably well acquainted with these islands by means of  Dampier  who on discovering the piratical designs of his captain one  Read  prevaled to be set on shore and with two or three  Achenese  who were landed after him resided  there some time He represents the natives as honest civil and harmless husband of one wife and according to the  English  rule till death doth them part They are neither addicted to quarrel theft or murder in their persons they are tall and welllimbed their visages long noses well proportioned and their whole features agreeable their hair lank and black their skins a deep copper the men go naked excepting the wrapper which passes round their waist and from thence under the thighs and brought so as to tuck before The women wear a short petticoat not reaching lower than the knee  THESE people have neither an apparent government or religion each man is patriarchal the ruler of his own family Their property consists in the plantations of coco palms  COCO TREES  which are along the shores the country inland seemed not cleared and impervious by any paths  THEY have another tree of use which they call the  Melory  MELORY  it grows wild  Dampier  who was very observant says he never saw any in other parts of his travels he adds it grows to the size of our larger apple trees that the fruit is as big as a penny loaf of the shape of a pear with a smooth greenish rind the inside is like that of an apple but full of small strings it is their chief food they either eat it boiled or scrape the pulp clear from the strings and make it into a cake as large as a  Dutch  cheese which will keep six or seven days and has a good taste they have a few small hogs and some poultry  THE principal employ of the natives is fishing their canoes are sharp at each end flat on one side and convex on  the other and have some slight outriggers These vessels go either with a sail or paddle and hold from nine to thirty men  THE  Nicobar  islands produce the beautiful and singular pigeon  PIGEON  to which they give name the feathers on the head are purple those of the neck long narrow and sharppointed like the haccle of a cock and reflecting various glosses of purple red gold blue and copper the back a changeable green the primaries a fine blue the tail and its coverts white  I NOW cross from the greater or more southern  Nicobar  to the island of  Junkseilon  ISLAND OF JUNKSEILON  about two hundred and sixty miles distant It lies northeast of the former between Lat ° ′ and ° ′ is of a long form the coast extremely indented with bays and very salient promontories the chief port is  Popra  the  Tacola emporium  of  Ptolemy Hamilton  Vol ii  says it produces good masts and that it has plenty of tin about five hundred tons are annually exported according to the account given by Captain  Forrest  who was there in The island subject to  Siam  is governed by a viceroy and three assistants and contains about twelve thousand inhabitants The northern end is divided from the continent by a channel not exceeding a mile in breadth Between the eastern side and the main land is a great bay filled with numbers of small isles and in the middle  Pulo Panjang  which from north to south is in length twentythree miles  Forrest p    THE kingdom of lower  Siam  bounds the northern and eastern sides of the bay within the last is comprehended the narrow isthmus of the peninsula of  Malacca  which does not exceed in breadth fifty miles  AT the termination of the kingdom of  Siam  KINGDOM OF QUEDAH  begins the little monarchy of  Quedah  a flat and fertile country which extends several leagues along the coast It was once tributary to  Siam  but during a war the  Siamese  were engaged in with  Pegu  it revolted and is governed by a  Malay Mahometan  prince as tyrannical as he is poor he resides in a town about fifty miles from the sea on a small navigable river the mouth of which is in Lat ° ′ This river according to  Mannevillette  branches peninsulates a great tract and reverts to the sea forming two distant entrances into the country the interior land rises to a great heighth The monarch never fails visiting the  European  ships which enter the port to extort from them some present the religion of the country is a mongrel  Mahometanism  mixed with the native idolatry  THE little  Quedah  turtle  Sonnerat vol ii  is of the size of a sparrow  TURTLE DOVE  and most delicious food it has been transported to the Isle of  France  where it has multiplied greatly  THE northern end of the island of  Sumatra  lies in Lat ° ′ and immediately opposite to old  Quedah  That part of  Sumatra  trends fast to the southeast till it reaches Cape  Diamond  in Lat ° ′ which is the parallel of  Pulo Dolom  an isle close to the shore of the peninsula of  Malacca  STREIGHTS OF MALACCA  Here commences the  Perimulicus sinus  or great streights of  Malacca  bounded by  Sumatra  on the west and the peninsula on the east I shall scarcely mention that noble island till I begin with it as chief of those of the  Indian Ocean  THE next place of note on the coast is a great tract of flat  land insulated by several channels which form various isles and open by different mouths into the sea  THE greater isle  PULO PERA  or  Pulo Pera  the antient  Perumela emporium  has a most useful and magnificent harbor which runs far inland with various branches on the right and on the left it has from eight to five fathoms of water a mountain rises out of the middle of the isle the river that runs up the country is called by Mr  Forrest Pera  Before its mouth is  Pulo DingDing  and other isles That navigator  P  went up the river to visit the monarch of the country who was attended by guards dressed in  Chinese  habits with the dragon on their breasts  FARTHER to the south in Lat ° ′ the streights contract in breadth very considerably  PULO ARU  The small isles  Pulo Aru  are in the middle of the channel which here begins to be greatly narrowed by rocks and banks on each shore On the  Malacca  side to the southeast of  Pulo Aru  is a large bay filled with flat morassy isles divided by very narrow channels On one of the most southern of them stands  Mount Parcelar  a noted seamark to ships navigating this dangerous streight  STILL more to the south  MALACCA CITY  in Lat ° ′ is  Malacca  the capital city of the peninsula it probably succeeded  Perimula  as the emporium of this part of  India  When the great  Albuquerque  had made his country sovereign of  Ceylon  he turned his thoughts towards this territory and determined to give to  Portugal  the whole commerce of the East At that time  Malacca  possessed the entire trade of  India  ships from every port of  Hindoostan  from  China  the  Phillipine  and the  Molucca  islands  from  Persia Arabia  and even  Africa  filled its harbor The  Arabians  brought with them their religion and established  Mahometanism  in the court of this kingdom as they had done in that of  Hindoostan  THIS port was first visited in by the  Portuguese  admiral  Lopez Sequiera  TAKEN BY THE PORTUGUESE  On his arrival he met with the most friendly reception from the reigning monarch but such a jealousy arose among the commercial people of the different nations especially the  Arabs  which they so effectually instilled into the prince as soon to destroy the good understanding between him and the strangers he had so suddenly taken an affection for His conduct had lulled the  Portuguese  into so deep a security that numbers of them took up their residence in the city and  Sequiera  even appointed  Araujo  a favorite of  Albuquerque  's as consul The prince did not dare to attack the admiral by open force but used every species of treachery to destroy him Finding his plots detected he ordered his subjects to massacre the  Europeans  who were in their power Numbers were slain but  Araujo  and a few others were kept as hostages to prevent the revenge of the admiral who after various endeavors to recover them was obliged to leave them behind and to set sail for the  Malabar  coast  Albuquerque  took advantage of the quarrel he sailed from  Goa  in and soon appearing before the port of  Malacca  clamed the release of his countrymen These demands were at first refused but after some hostilities the king was so terrified as to send to  Albuquerque Araujo  and all the surviving  Portuguese  Notwithstanding this it was discovered that he intended  nothing less than the destruction of the  Europeans  It is evident he had great reason to suspect his new guests for  Albuquerque  among other requests desired leave to erect a fort to secure his countrymen from any future attacks This the king knew was only a prelude to the subjection of him and his subjects to a foreign yoke The refusal was followed by the landing of the  Portuguese  several severe skirmishes ensued which as usual ended with the defeat of the  Indians  The city was forced and the palace taken by storm but though the king found means to escape with all his valuable effects  Albuquerque  got two hundred thousand ducats to his share of the plunder Among other means of resistance the  Malayes  placed in the way of the assailants a sort of  chevaux de frize  with poisoned points No people are so expert as the  Malayes  in that dreadful art The city was also defended by three thousand cannon a number of artillery surprising in those days The monarch fled to the woods where he soon died of grief This success of  Albuquerque  's struck all the neighboring nations with admiration The king of  Siam  and the princes of  Sumatra  and  Java  and the other neighboring isles sent to him embassadors and various rich presents Those from  Java  very politically presented him with spears and darts all kinds of hostile weapons and pieces of embroidery representing the warlike exploits of their master to impress on the stranger an idea of the valor of the  Javanese  monarch  THE  Portuguese  from time to time fortified  Malacca  in a manner suitable to its importance and it became the greatest emporium in  India  By this wise stroke of policy  Albuquerque  gave to his country the possession of the gold the gems the spices  and other rich productions of  India ultra Gangem  and its islands as he did before those of  Hindoostan  by the capture of the famous city of  Goa  THE  Portuguese  continued in possession of  Malacca  till the year  EXPELLED BY THE DUTCH  when it was wrested out of their hands by the  Dutch  after a six months siege The governor is accused by historians of treachery and to have been bribed into a surrender but it is certain that he did not give the place up till after the most gallant defence The  Dutch  sensible of its value paid the utmost attention to its fortifications and to every thing that could revive the antient commerce which had almost sunk to nothing by the tyranny and usual ill conduct of the  Portuguese  THE city had in their time several fine churches and numbers of monasteries and the Jesuits a noble college in which they exercised great hospitality All these of course fell to decay under the reign of the sons of  Calvin  Sharp as they are they were outwitted by the sons of  Rome  the religious of the several convents made a request to the conqueror that they might be permitted to quit their houses in solemn procession each carried a large waxen taper in his hand within which were concealed their diamonds and all the lesser treasures The victors were defrauded of the fruits of their valor and as  Sonnerat  says their commander lost his head on his return to  Holland  for not having sagacity enough to discover the trick  Malacca  is exceedingly large much of it is built of strong bamboo but the several stone buildings among them the governor's house make a conspicuous figure A narrow but deep and  rapid river divides the town from the fort one side of which is washed by the sea in that part only four leagues distant from the low land of  Sumatra Malacca  is a true emporium or mart the great magazine of the various rich articles of commerce brought from the several countries I have mentioned As to the peninsula itself it yields little more than the sine tin and elephants' teeth Let me conclude that this place was celebrated among the antients for its gold  AUREA CHERSONESUS  for which reason it was called by them  Aurea Chersonesus  still at no great distance from the city of  Malacca  is a hill called the  Golden Mount  Some imagine this to have been the  Ophir  of  Solomon  I shall mention in vol of the Outlines of the Globe the supposition that  Ophir  was a place in  Aethiopia  I will not enter into the dispute and only say that if the birds which we know at present by the name of peacocks were those intended  Kings ch x verse  this or some other part of  India  might have been the place from which  Solomon  drew his wealth peacocks being found in plenty here and unknown at least in those days in any part of  Africa  To the south of  Malacca  is the small kingdom of  Johore  KINGDOM OF JOHORE  we have scarce any acquaintance with it and know little more of its history than that it was governed by a brutal set of princes and that in a rebellion arose which ended in the expulsion of the royal family  THE southern entrance into the streights of  Malacca  is filled with a most numerous archipelago of small isles even to the shores of  Sumatra  The land from  Tanjong Buro  in  Johore  bends into a crescent likewise filled with isles One is called  Sincapour  STREIGHTS OF SINCAPOUR  which gives name to the wellknown passage for ships  bound to or from the East There are several other channels between the islands but that of  Sincapour  is the best yet all are subject to danger by reason of the rapidity and irregularity of the tides and the reefs or sand banks which are found in some or other of these narrow passages The western horn of the crescent is  Cape Romano  this stands in Lat ° ′  CAPE ROMANO  and is the most southern point of the continent of  Asia  A little to the west of that point on a large river stands the city of  Johore  or  Batusabar  erroneously supposed by M  D'Anville  to have been the same with the  Zaba  or  Sabana emporium  of  Ptolemy  The  Cape Romano  is certainly the  Magnum Promontorium  or  Malaeucolon  a name borrowed from the antient  Malayes Romano  seems to be a traditional name used in memory of the nations which frequented the adjacent port where the ships must often have been obliged to wait for the proper wind to enable them to double the great promontory and pursue their voyage to the several marts on each side of the gulph of  Siam  FOR the tracing the remainder of the coasts on the continent I shall no more consult the opinion of my able guide M  D'Anville  but follow that of a countryman Mr  John Caverhill  who in the lviith volume of the Philosophical Transactions has given a very able criticism on those parts of  Ptolemy  which relate to these particular shores  AFTER doubling the  Cape Romano  the peninsula takes a north northwestern direction Between Lat ° ′ and  Pulo Varela  in Lat ° ′ is an extensive group of small isles which fill the sea for a considerable breadth almost to the very shore the largest is  Pulo Timon  PULO TIMON  In passing down the streights of  Malacca  as far as  Cape Romano  navigators are obliged to take an eastern course  Dampier's Voyage ii  This proves how well  Ptolemy  was informed when he said that the  Roman  ships bound for  Cattigara  took that direction but afterwards when they had doubled the Cape they being hurried easterly by the tide which rushes through the streights of  Sincapour  were under the necessity of making a tack and proceeding westerly to reach the several ports they might be bound for in the  Magnus Sinus  Pahang  port  PAHANG  and town are in Lat ° ′ and in a most fruitful country The mouth of the river has an island before it The north channel has at high water the depth of four fathoms and just within the bar good anchorage in six The estuary is a mile broad but so full of sand banks that it is with great trouble a vessel of thirty tons can work up to the town distant twelve miles from the sea The river rises far up the country washes the foot of the hill of  Malacca  GOLD  and contains a vast deal of gold  Hamilton  visited this country in and reports that lumps of five or six ounces weight have been found The divers usually descend to the depth of three fathoms but the greatest lumps of the pretious metal are found in ten Some years eight hundred weight have been exported Well may this country have been supposed to have been another  Ophir Josephus  Lib viii c ii  seems to have been right in fixing it here if his authority was good for saying that the antient name of this part of  India  was  Sophora  now the land of gold which comes so very near to that of  Ophir  Possibly the word is the  Malayan  name for the pretious metal M  Le Poivre  says that the inhabitants of  Malacca  and  Sumatra  call their gold mines  ophirs  and Mr  Marsden  Voyage to Sumatra p  that in the latter island is a hill named  Mount Ophir  possibly from its having been once rich in gold  MUCH pepper is cultivated on the sides of the river  PEPPER  about three hundred tons have been sent to market but had there been a demand three thousand might be raised in the space of five years The best canes in the world are said to grow in these parts  Trangano  or  Tringoran  TRANGANO  a small town a little to the north of  Pahang  is seated on a river near the sea in which small ships may moor securely among the rocks The town did consist of above a thousand houses half of which are inhabited by  Chinese  who traffic in their  jonks  to  Siam Cambodia  and  Tonquin Trangano  is most deliciously seated amidst low hills covered with the eternal verdure of undeciduous trees lemons oranges  FRUITS  mangostans and all the fruits of the  Indies  grow here in perfection and the vallies laugh with grain pulse and sugar but all owing to the industry of the  Chinese  The feudal  Malayes  are too lazy to make the earth yield its increase Pepper is raised in great abundance but the port is shut up from  October to March  by a most violent sea driven in by the northeast monsoons In the still months the sea is said to afford the finest of fish  Ptolemy  places either in the neighborhood of this town or  Pahang  a place called  Thagora  LATITUDE ° passes over part of the group of the  Ridang  isles  RIDANO ISLES  which lie not remote from the coast They are inhabited by  Malayan  pirates who seize on any vessels they can master especially  the  Chinese  and sell the crews and passengers for slaves It is not infrequent that they murder the whole crew Their vessels are crowded with men armed either with lances and cresses or short daggers They suddenly board the ships they think they can master and having their native ferocity heightened by opium instantly stab all whom they find in their way These miscreants swarm in the streights of  Malacca  and in all the islands which go under the name of  Malaye  Patani  PATANI  in Lat ° ′ the next town of note lies close on the shore and was once greatly frequented by ships from  Surat  the  Malabar  coast and that of  Coromandel  beside what come from  China  and other neighboring countries but the merchants finding no protection from the murderous pirates quite deserted the place This may have been the  Balonga  of  Ptolemy  ADVANCING still north  GULPH OF SIAM  we enter the gulph of  Siam  the  Magnus Sinus  of the same geographer the land after passing  Patani  makes a considerable curvature towards the west which continues as far as  Patanor  in about Lat ° where it bends towards the northeast till it ends in the bottom of the gulph at the river of  Siam  Thus finishes the outline of this celebrated peninsula  IN this curvature  PIPERI  near the bottom of the bay stood the antient  Sipiberis  the modern  Piperi  and to the south of it  Sindu  the present  Sini  WE shall take a review of its whole extent from the northern end of its isthmus in Lat ° ′ to its southern extremity at cape  Romano  which is about six hundred and sixty miles The breadth in the widest part is about two hundred miles from  that part it gradually narrows till it ends nearly in a point at cape  Romano  All the interior parts of the country are hilly the lower grounds towards the sea marshy and wooded  IN respect to the general view of the peninsula its productions and the singular manners and government of the inhabitants it is impossible to give a more clear statement than in the words of M  Le Poivre  the author of the celebrated  Voyages d'un Philosophe  We use the translation of which is done in a style equally elegant with that of the original I will not injure it by abridgment but give the whole from p to p and afterwards some explanatory remarks on certain parts and a brief account of the natural history collected from different materials In the articles of botany mineralogy and zoology there is so great agreement between the productions of the opposite  Sumatra  and the peninsula that I shall except in a very few instances defer entering on those subjects till I arrive in that great island  I SHALL now return to M  Le Poivre  "BEYOND the kingdom of  Siam  "  OF THE MALAYES  says that most observant and judicious traveller  is the peninsula of  Malacca  a country formerly well peopled and consequently well cultivated This nation was once one of the greatest powers and made a very considerable figure on the theatre of  Asia  The sea was covered with their ships and they carried on a most extensive commerce Their laws however were apparently very different from those which subsist among them at present From time to time they sent out numbers of colonies which one after another peopled the islands of  Sumatra Java Borneo  the  Celebes  or  Macassar  the  Moluccas  the  Phillippines  and those innumerable islands of the  Archipelago  which bound  Asia  on the east and which occupy an extent of seven hundred leagues in longitude from east to west by about six hundred of latitude from north to south The inhabitants of all these islands those at least upon the coasts are the same people they speak almost the same language have the same laws the same mannersIs it not somewhat singular that this nation whose possessions are so extensive should scarce be known in Europe I shall endeavor to give you an idea of those laws and those manners you will from thence easily judge of their agriculture  TRAVELLERS who make observations on the  Malais  are astonished to find in the center of  Asia  under the scorching climate of the line the laws the manners the customs and the prejudices of the antient inhabitants of the north of  Europe  The  Malais  are governed by feudal laws that capricious system conceived for the defence of the liberty of a few against the tyranny of one whilst the multitude is subjected to slavery and oppression  A CHIEF who has the title of king or sultan issues his commands to his great vassals who obey when they think proper these have inferior vassals who often act in the same manner with regard to them A small part of the nation live independent under the title of  Oramcai  or noble and sell their services to those who pay them best whilst the body of the nation is composed of slaves and live in perpetual servitude  WITH these laws the  Malais  are restless fond of navigation  war plunder emigrations colonies desperate enterprises adventures and gallantry They talk incessantly of their honor and their bravery whilst they are universally considered by those with whom they have intercourse as the most treacherous ferocious people on the face of the globe and yet which appeared to me extremely singular they speak the softest language of  Asia  That which the Count  de Forbin  has said in his memoirs of the ferocity of the  Macassars  is exactly true and is the reigning characteristic of the whole  Malay  nations more attached to the absurd laws of their pretended honor than to those of justice or humanity you always observe that amongst them the strong oppress and destroy the weak their treaties of peace and friendship never subsisting beyond that selfinterest which induced them to make them they are almost always armed and either at war amongst themselves or employed in pillaging their neighbors  THIS ferocity which the  Malais  qualify under the name of courage is so well known to the  European  companies who have settlements in the  Indies  that they have universally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their ships who may put into the  Malay  islands from taking on board any seamen of that nation except in the greatest distress and then on no account to exceed two or three  IT is nothing uncommon for a handful of these horrid savages suddenly to embark attack a vessel by surprise poignard in hand massacre the people and make themselves masters of her  Malay  batteaus with twentyfive or thirty  men have been known to board  European  ships of thirty or forty guns in order to take possession of them and murder with their poignards great part of the crew The  Malay  history is full of such enterprises which mark the desperate ferocity of these barbarians  THE  Malais  who are not slaves go always armed they would think themselves disgraced if they went abroad without their poignards which they call  Crit  the industry of this nation even surpasses itself in the fabric of this destructive weapon  As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tumult they could never endure the long flowing habits which prevail amongst the other  Asiatics  The habits of the  Malais  are exactly adapted to their shapes and loaded with a multitude of buttons which fasten them close to their bodies in every part I relate these seemingly trifling observations in order to prove that in climates the most opposite the same laws produce similar manners customs and prejudices their effect is the same too with respect to agriculture  THE lands possessed by the  Malais  are in general of a superior quality nature seems to have taken pleasure in there assembling her most favorite productions They have not only those to be found in the territories of  Siam  but a variety of others peculiar to these islands The country is covered with odoriferous woods such as the eagle or aloes wood the sandal and the  Cassia Odorata  a species of cinnamon you there breathe an air impregnated with the odors of innumerable flowers of the greatest fragrance of which there is a perpetual  succession the year round the sweet flavor of which captivates the soul and inspires the most voluptuous sensations No traveller wandering over the plains of  Malacca  but feels himself strongly impelled to wish his residence fixed in a place so luxuriant in allurements where nature triumphs without the assistance of art  THE  Malay  islands produce various kinds of dying woods particularly the  Sapan  which is the same with the  Brazil  wood There are also a number of gold mines which the inhabitants of  Sumatra  and  Malacca  call  Ophirs  some of which those especially on the eastern coast are richer than those of  Brazil  or  Peru  There are likewise mines of fine copper mixed with gold which the inhabitants name  Tombage  In the islands of  Sumatra  and  Banca  are mines of  calin  or sine tin and at  Succadana  in the island of  Borneo  is a mine of diamonds Those islands enjoy also exclusively the  rotin  the  sagow  or bread palm tree the camphre and other precious aromatics which we know under the names of various spiceries  THE sea too teems with abundance of excellent fish together with ambergris pearls and those delicate birds nests so much in request in  China  formed in the rocks with the spawn of fishes and the foam of the sea by a species of small sized swallow peculiar to those seas this is of such an exquisite substance and flavor that the  Chinese  long purchased them for their weight in gold and still buy them at an excessive price  IN the midst of all this luxuriance of nature the  Malay  is  miserable the culture of the lands abandoned to slaves is fallen into contempt These wretched laborers dragged incessantly from their rustic employments by then restless masters who delight in war and maritime enterprises have rarely time and never resolution to give the necessary attention to the laboring of their grounds their lands in general remain uncultivated and produce no kind of grain for the subsistence of the inhabitants  Malacca  abounds with quadrupeds especially with tigers and others of the most savage kind It is customary here and in  Pegu  for the tyrants of the country to make banishment into the woods for a certain time a punishment the unhappy objects are sure of never returning they quickly become a prey to the tiger or if they chance to escape the fangs of that cruel animal fall victims to hunger or corroding fear  THE only peculiar quadruped seems to be the  Civet  described by M  Sonnerat  Vol ii tab xci    CIVET ANIMAL  an elegant species of the size of a common cat the ground color is a perlaceous grey darkest on the upper part of the body above the eyes is a line of four small spots on the hind part of the head commence three black bands ending on the shoulders another divides the belly lengthways on the reins are three which end at the tail on the sides and thighs are seven rows of round black spots sixtyone in number the tail is long and annulated with black and grey This animal inhabits the woods leaps from tree to tree and is extremely fierce It distils from the opening placed near the genitals a musky liquor which the  Malayes  collect and pretend  that it fortifies the stomach and excites the amorous passions for which last purpose it is bought and highly esteemed by the  Chinese  M  Sonnerat  Vol ii  gives a very apocryphal account of the wild men of  Malacca  WILD MEN  who inhabit the woods and live in the trees If they see any one pass they instantly descend and devour him There is says he another kind less ferocious and which shun the society of their anthropophagous brethren these live on fruits are monogamous and never cohabit with their wives but when nature invites some even will enter into a sort of traffic with the  Malayes  and deposit at the foot of their treehabitations the tin they collect on the mountains for which the natives leave fruits and any trifles they think acceptable to their secluded brethren their language is unknown M  Sonnerat  says he saw one taken young in the service of a counsellor of  Malacca  I wish he had fallen to the lot of a  Scotch Judge  what a treasure would he have been to Lord  Monboddo  Seriously M  Sonnerat  must have collected some tales of the  Ourang Outang  possibly a native of this country as it is of the  Malayan  archipelago  THE  Malayes  are a well made people but rather below says Mr  Marsden  the middle stature their limbs small well shaped and particularly slender at the wrists and ancles their complexions tawney their eyes large their noses flat probably by art their hair black shining and very long  THERE are a few birds that I mention  BIRDS  because M  Sonnerat  ascribes them to the peninsula yet all that are found here must  also inhabit  Sumatra  He gives us the description of the bluerumped perroquet of Mr  Latham  Supp lxvi The fore head and rump are blue the predominant color of the rest of the plumage palegreen the inner coverts

LET me return to the vegetable kingdom to make one exception to my design  MANGOSTAN  I must here mention the  Garcinia Mangostana  the most boasted fruit of the  Indies  and which is found in the highest perfection in this peninsula the name  Mangostan  is  Malayan  It is a species confined to  Malacca  and the  Malaye  isles grows neither in  Hindoostan  nor naturally in the  Molucca  isles but is cultivated in  Amboina  the tree does not attain any great height the fruit is of the size of a small apple of a round form and deep red wine color on the summit is a star of five or six rays squared at their ends at the bottom are four hollow leaves the remains of the calyx the inside is purple and like a furrowed globe divided into segments each containing a kernel These segments are full of juice the most delicious that can be imagined a fine mixture of tart and sweet and so wholesome as to be allowed in any quantities to feverous patients  This valuable tree is described by  Bontius  p of his  Historia Naturalis Ind Orient  who ushers in his description with these lines  J B Bontius l c  Cedant Hesperii longe hinc mala aurea fructus  Ambrosiâ pascit  Mangostam  et nectare

plate is published in vol viii p of  Martyn  's abridgment of our Transactions In the  Herbarium Amboinense  Vol i p  is a very good description and in plate xliii an excellent figure of the same tree Every voyager who has visited the places of the growth of this delicious fruit is full of its p  aises  I NOW return to the coast  UPPER SIAM  The kingdom of  Siam  recommences on this side near  Sangora  exactly opposite to its limits on the bay of  Bengal  The town stands on a large river and has some commerce in tin ivory aloewood and coarse gold  Ligore  about twelve leagues to the north  LIGORE  is a very commercial town and its neighborhood produces abundance of tin and of elephants teeth It is seated a few miles up the river and built of bamboo thatched with reeds the pagodas have lofty steeples in form of pyramids The  Dutch  have or had here a factory their houses stand a league within the mouth of the river and are built with brick The road for shipping is two leagues at sea  THE whole eastern side of  Siam  is low steep and rocky but inland rises into lofty mountains Towards the bottom of the gulph the land approximates and the contracted part is called the bay of  Siam  its entrance is by the mounts of  Pensels  or  Pentens  impending over the water on the western shore and the high cape  Siam  on the opposite The last may be seen from the bar of  Siam  or the  Meinam  river twentytwo leagues distant  ABOUT four hundred and eight miles from  Ligore  following the curvature of the gulph at the very bottom of the bay of  Siam  RIVER MEINAM  is the mouth of the great river  Meinam  the  Serus  of  Ptolemy  and the most consequential in the kingdom The road for shipping extends for the space of three leagues in which all sorts of vessels may safely ride such was the case when that learned traveller  Koempfer  visited the place in The country on both sides the river is marshy composed of the mud brought down in the annual floods this river like the  Ganges  being subject to periodical inundations  Koempfer  informs us that the name  Manam  or  Meinam  in the  Siamese  language signifies the mother of humidities from its abundance of water which so greatly fertilizes the country It is deep rapid and broader than the  Elbe  the upper part is rocky violent and interrupted by cataracts the lower divided into several channels passes through a very level country to the sea The banks of the river are covered with trees animated by monkies numbers of villages may be seen on both sides the houses generally stand I may say upon stilts or lofty posts so that the water during the inundations may pass without incommoding the occupiers Near the city of  Judia  many of the villages consist of inhabited ships  or floating habitations these occasionally move from place to place when the waters are high the inmates keep a sort of fair and dispose of their various commodities  THE  Meinam  rises at a considerable distance to the north in the very extremity of the kingdom possibly far beyond for its fountains seem never to have been traced and the best accounts are very uncertain its course as far as we know runs due north and south  Juthia  or  Judia  the capital of  Siam  is seated in about Lat  CITY OF JUTHIA  ° ′ on a low island in the form of a man's foot It is surrounded with a lofty brick wall The streets are strait and accommodated with canals which pass quite through from east to west As Mr  Caverhill  very reasonably fixes the  Zaba  of  Ptolemy  to have been in the bottom of the bay of  Siam  I see no reason against supposing that it might have been either at  Juthia  or at some place not remote from that port Ships may enter into many of the canals and discharge their cargo near the principal houses The greater part of the streets are very mean built with bamboo covered with the leaves of palms Those of the  Chinese Hindoos  and  Moors  are of stone but very low the finest houses in  Koempfer  's time were such which had been inhabited by the  English Dutch  and  French  HISTORY OF PHAULKON  The palace of the unfortunate  Phaulkon  minister of state in the last century makes the most conspicuous figure  Phaulkon  was a  Grecian  by birth and seaman by profession he had served various nations but chiefly the  English  In their service in capacity of a cockswain he came to  Siam  and obtained an employment at court He was a man of very fine natural abilities and by his good conduct  and his success in the management of affairs rose to the highest dignities and became prime minister to the reigning prince  HIS ambition proved his ruin and brought him to a violent death by the hands of the executioner He became so intoxicated with power as to entertain a design upon the throne to depose his royal master and to place over the  Siamese Monpi Totfo  soninlaw to the monarch a phantom of a king who was to be dependent on his will and to be deposed as soon as affairs came to a crisis The king was at that time extremely ill of a dropsy on his decease the whole royal lineage was to be put to death and  Phaulkon  usurp the power  IN order to accomplish his designs it was necessary to call in foreign aid he persuaded his weak master to send an embassy to  Louis  XIV to request his most Christian Majesty to send persons qualified to instruct in the arts his unpolished subjects so that he might shine preeminent among the Eastern nations The first who set out in were shipwrecked the second arrived safe in The vanity of  Louis  made him receive with every mark of respect these grotesque legates the memory of their reception is preserved in a medal  Histoire de Medailles tab ccxvi  The king is represented seated on his throne the embassadors making their obeisance above his majesty is inscribed  Fama virtutis  intimating that the fame of his high qualities had induced them to come from this distant country  Louis  in compliance with the wish of the embassy sent Jesuits artists and military officers  General de Fargues  landed with several hundred soldiers and was put into possession  of  Bankok  the key of the kingdom seated on the river between the capital and the sea Just as every thing was ready for execution in May the plot was discovered  Monpi  was seized by the king's son and his head cast at  Phaulkon  's feet The minister thus hurled from his greatness was tortured and almost starved to death then carried out of town and beheaded his body cut in two and covered with a little earth was soon devoured by the dogs a sad proof how  Ambitio male suada ruit  THE kingdom of  Siam  is divided from north to south by a long range of lofty mountains On the west side  ACCOUNT OF SIAM  or next to the bay of  Bengal  the country is visited by continual rains during the time the  Monsoons  blow from that quarter On the eastern side no such deluges are known nor any floods but what are the effects of the moderate inundations of the  Meinam  which fertilize the country beyond description  FERTILITY  The useful grain rice is produced in amazing crops and every delicate fruit of the  Indies  without cultivation  Raynal  mentions among the productions of  Siam  logwood like that cut in  Campeachy  It is a terrestrial paradise but loses all its advantages by groaning under the most despotic government on earth The monarch rules within his seraglio and his grandees are let loose to oppress the wretched commonalty according to their caprice and unrestrained will Dominions thus governed stretch near a thousand miles from north to south or from Lat ° ′ to Lat ° ′ and in the broadest part extend three hundred and sixty  THE religion of the country is the same with that inculcated by the  Bramins  RELIGION  but the  Bramins  of  Siam  are not a peculiar race like those of  Hindoostan  here every one who chuses assumes  the priesthood they usually lead a monastic life and have their convents those of each province are governed by a sort of bishop Nuns or female monastics are frequent The pagodas are of various forms some have a great resemblance to the  Chinese  architecture The idols are monstrous in their appearance  THE first knowledge of the Christian religion was received by the mission of Jesuits  MISSIONARIES  led here under the conduct of  Alexander  of  Rhodes  some time before the year when pope  Alexander  VII sent over a reinforcement of religious men but these being of other orders were treated by the Jesuits with the utmost indignity nor would they condescend to permit them to share in their labors which had been attended with prodigious success As to the message  Louis  XIV sent by his embassador Mr  Chaumont  in modestly requesting his  Siamese  Majesty to become a good Catholic he received this very proper reply  that he left it to his most Christian Majesty to judge whether a change of a religion that had been followed in his dominions without interruption during two thousand two hundred and twentynine years could be a matter of small importance to him or a demand with which it was easy to comply and a matter which related entirely to  God  and not to him  This well might check the zeal of the missionaries but in the next reign on the discovery of the treachery of the  French  general and the murder of  Phaulkon  the whole troop of the religious were sent away and all hopes of return entirely overthrown  IN many respects the  Siamese  have an agreement with the  Chinese  we must except their bodies which are small In their headdress they agree in the pointed bonnet in the frequent inhabiting of ships and boats and now and then in their ornamented architecture The faces of the inhabitants are large  FORM OF THE SIAMESE  their cheek bones prominent their foreheads and chins contract equally to a point their cheeks hollow their eyes small and oblique nose short and rounded their ears long by artificial distension their complexions swarthy their hair black and coarse and would be extremely long but that it is cut so very close that their heads seem beset with bristles their teeth black from art  IT is to be lamented that so well informed a traveller as  Koempfer  should not have left us any thing on the subject of the natural history of so fertile a kingdom we have nothing to say of its vegetable productions and as to its animals we can only inform our readers that it swarms with elephants  ELEPHANTS  and that their teeth are a considerable article of commerce In this tyrannous government they are quite a pest these and other herbivorous beasts destroy the labors of the husbandmen and none dare repel the attacks of those ravagers Elephants are here only reserved for state the king keeps great numbers and often makes them the instrument of his cruelty They are the executioners of his wrath on his offending subjects and are instructed how to put them to various kinds of death either by trampling them under their broad feet or deliberately tearing their limbs off with their lithe proboscis or flinging them up into the air and catching them empaled on their great tusks  BUFFALOES and deer are found here in vast numbers  DEER  their  skins constitute a great article of commerce fifty thousand of them have annually been sent to  Japan  through the medium of the  Dutch Mandelslo  a most intelligent traveller gives the following account of the trade of  Siam  as it was in the year speaking of the city of  Juthia  he says  the principal commerce consists in stuffs brought from  Suratta  and the coast of  Coromandel  all sorts of  Chinese  commodities precious stones gold benjamin wax copper lead indico calambawood brazilwood sapphires rubies c but above all deer skins whereof they furnish the  Japanese  with about fifty thousand every year It likewise yields a great trade of rice which they transport to all the neighboring isles  TO this we may add the more modern account of the rich productions of this kingdom  OTHER PRODUCTIONS  taken from Mr  Dalrymple  's Repertory  P    The productions of this country are prodigious quantities of grain cotton benjamin sandal agualo and sapan woods antimony tin lead iron loadstones gold and silver sapphires emeralds agates crystal marble and tambanck  HOGS and wild swine swarm in the dominions of  Siam  most of the savage beasts of  India  are equally numerous in this kingdom  Koempfer  speaks of two species of monkies one very large and black the other smaller and of a grey color The first seems a kind not well ascertained for the only black monkey of the old world we are acquainted with is that described by Mr  Edwards  tab which is no larger than a cat  AFTER doubling cape  Liant  RIVER OF LIANT  a bay opens to the north and at the bottom receives the river of  Liant  A vast chain of mountains  which run from north to south and unite with those of  China  in Lat ° ′ divide the kingdom of  Siam  from the kingdoms of  Laos  and  Cambodia  and almost reach the sea near the river of  Liant  The upper part of this tract is in  Laos  the more southern forms the kingdom of  Cambodia  which is compared to a vast valley bounded by the  Siamese  chain to the west and that of  CochinChina  to the east The coast takes a southeastern direction from the bay of  Liant  as far as cape  Cambodia  a space of three hundred miles skirted by numbers of small isles washed by the bay of  Siam  From the point of  Liant  is a sandy barren desert reaching according to  Hamilton  as far as  Ponteamas  above twothirds of the coast  THIS extensive tract has great scarcity of ports  PONTEAMAS  the most distinguished is that of  Ponteamas  in Lat ° ′ M  Le Poivre  gives so enchanting a picture of this colony that I will no more risque injuring it by the abridgment than I did his history of the  Malayes  His descriptions are so exquisite that I must hope that they will not fall under a too frequent imputation on the writers of his lively nation of being  plus beau que la verité  Departing says M  Le Poivre  from the peninsula of  Malacca  and the islands of the  Malais  towards the north I fell in with a small territory called  Cancar  but known on the maritime charts under the name of  Ponthiamas  Surrounded by the kingdom of  Siam  where despotism and depopulation go hand in hand the dominions of  Camboya  where no idea of established government subsists and the territories of the  Malais  whose genius perpetually agitated by their feudal laws can endure peace neither at home nor abroad this charming  country about fifty years ago was uncultivated and almost destitute of inhabitants  A  Chinese  merchant commander of a vessel which he employed in commerce frequented these coasts being a man of that intelligent reflective genius which so characteristically marks his nation he could not without pain behold immense tracts of ground condemned to sterility though naturally more fertile than those which formed the riches of his own country he formed therefore a plan for their improvement with this view having first of all hired a number of laborers some  Chinese  others from the neighboring nations he with great address insinuated himself into the favor of the most powerful princes who for a certain subsidy assigned him a guard for his protection  IN the course of his voyage to  Batavia  and the  Philippine  islands he borrowed from the  Europeans  their most useful discoveries and improvements particularly the art of fortification and defence with regard to internal police he gave the preference to the  Chinese  The profits of his commerce soon enabled him to raise ramparts sink ditches and provide artillery these preliminary precautions secured him from a  coup de main  and protected him from the enterprizes of the surrounding nations of barbarians  HE distributed the lands to his laborers without the least reservation of any of those duties or taxes known by the names of service or fines of alienation duties which by allowing no real property become the most fatal scourge to agriculture and is an idea which revolts against the common sense of  every wise nation He provided his colonists at the same time with all sorts of instruments proper for the labor and improvement of their grounds  IN forming a laboring and commercial people he thought that no laws ought to be framed but those which nature has established for the human race in every climate he made these laws respected by obeying them first himself and exhibiting an example of simplicity industry frugality humanity and good faith he formed then no system of lawshe did morehe established morals  HIS territories soon became the country of every industrious man who wished to settle there his port was open to all nations The woods were cleared the grounds judiciously labored and sown with rice canals cut from the rivers watered their fields and plentiful harvests after supplying them with subsistence furnished an object of extensive commerce His integrity his moderation and his humanity made him respected He never wished to reign but only to establish the empire of reason his son who now fills his place inherits his virtues as well as his possessions by agriculture and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands he has become so powerful that the barbarians his neighbors stile him king a title which he despises he pretends to no right of sovereignty but the noblest of all that of doing good happy in being the first laborer and the first merchant of his country he merits as well as his father a title more glorious than that of kingthe friend of mankind  THE barbarians of the neighborhood amazed to see abundance  so suddenly succeed to sterility flocked for subsistence to the magazines of  Ponthiamas  whose dominions at this day are considered as the most plentiful granary of that eastern part of  Asia  the  Malais  the  Cochin Chinese  the  Siamese  whose countries are naturally so fertile considering this little territory as the most certain resource against famine  LET me here add that our plain  Hamilton  who visited  Ponteamas  in found the town in ruins It had been taken and plundered in the year by the  Siamese  fleet at which time it was a place of considerable trade It may have recovered by the time M  Le Poivre  was there so as to vindicate his enthusiastic account The town is seated on a deep but narrow river which in the season of inundations communicates with that of  Meinam Kom  CAMBODIA  or  Cambodia  and the city of the same name on its banks by which means the commodities of the kingdom are sent to this port in preference to that at the mouth of the  Cambodia  which is said to be of very troublesome navigation by reason of the numbers of low islands and sand banks which obstruct the channel  IT is highly probable that such was the state of this river from the very early times we find no antient port at this place but learn from  Ptolemy  CATTIGARA  that one called  Cattigara Sinarum Statio  stood on or near the scite of  Ponteamas  on a marshy coast productive of reeds  bamboos  so large that when they were joined and tied together passengers were enabled to cross from one side to the other  Marcianus Heracleota  who wrote not long before the building of  Constantinople  adds besides that it stood on the river  Cotiaris  and was the termination of the known and habitable earth to the south The  Periplus  of this geographer may be found in the first volume of the  Geographiae veteris Scriptores  published at  Oxford  in  THE  Notium Promontorium  NOTIUM PROMONT  was to the northwest of  Ponteamas  The bay mentioned by  Marcianus Heracleota  to be so infested by wild beasts and the part inhabited by the  Ethiopian Icthyophagi  extended from that port to the south cape  Cambodia  seems the  Satyrorum Promontorium  probably because it was the haunt of some large species of monkey  THE productions of the kingdom of  Cambodia  are gold and ivory in great abundance  PRODUCTIONS OF CAMBODIA  The  Siamese  in their expedition of destroyed not less than two hundred tons that happened to be in the port ready for exportation  Sandal  wood  sapan  wood  aloes  wood  stick lac  and a great variety of drugs  Dampier  Voy Vol ii p  adds rice dragons blood lac i e varnish in large jars which looked blackish and thick and a yellow purging gum in great cakes called  Cambodia  by which he certainly means gamboge The whole country is prodigiously fertile and yields almost every thing that the vegetable or animal kingdom produces in common with other parts of Eastern  India  THE  Portuguese  says  Mandelslo  were in possession of the commerce of  Cambodia  as late as the year notwithstanding every effort of the  Dutch  to come in for a share but it must have been long enjoyed by the latter nation after the fall of the  Portuguese  empire in  India  The reigning prince in seemed very solicitous that the  English  should settle in his dominions  and offered to permit us to form factories and build forts to protect our trade Mr  Bowyear  hereafter to be mentioned says that the  Cambodians  resemble the  Malays  whose language is generally understood in all these parts  ABOUT two hundred  Topasses  or  Indian Portuguese  were settled and married in the capital of  Cambodia  when  Hamilton  was there and seemed the only remains of that people They all have small pensions from the king of the country but in order to support themselves are obliged to take to the chace of elephants which they shoot for the sake of their teeth with iron slugs poisoned by immersion in the thick bark of a certain tree the beast is sure to fall in a short time after receiving its wound The same method is used in killing the buffaloes on account of their tongues  FROM cape  Cambodia  the country bends due east the river of the same name discharges itself into the sea at the distance of about one hundred miles  CITY  through several mouths The city stands ninety miles up the river and consists of only one street which is built on an eminence to preserve it from the annual inundations the rains begin to fall in  June  and continue during the months of  July  and  August  THIS was near the scite of  Thina Metropolis Sinarum  of  Ptolemy  and  Marcianus  Mr  Caverhill  quotes  Argensol  for the proof and says on his authority that marble ruins of an extensive city have been discovered to the northwest of  Cambodia  yet  Ptolemy  relates that it was not surrounded with brazen walls nor had any thing worth mentioning  Arrian  in his  Periplus Maris Erythraei  calls it the greatest of the inland cities and that it sent to  Barygaza  the modern  Barochia  on the western side of  Hindoostan  wool thread and  othonium sericum  Outlines of the Globe vol i p  These were carried the whole of the journey by men on foot prodigious must it have been if it is true that they went through  Bactra  a detour of amazing extent  THE kingdom of  Cambodia  was known to the  Arabs  by the name of  Rachmi  RACHMI  It was visited in the ninth century by two  Arabian  travellers who report that the finest muslins in the world were made there and that the natives wore garments so fine that they might be drawn through a middle sized ring The same writers speak wonderful things of the  Karkandan  or unicorn but from the whole description it is evident that they mean no other animal than our onehorned rinoceros  LET me conclude the account of the kingdom with saying  THE ANTIENT THINAE AND SINAE  that the antients comprehended under the name of  Thinae  and  Sinae  not only  Cambodia  but also  Pegu Siam Laos CochinChina  and the more southern parts of  China  of which  Thina  was the common capital  THE noted island of  Pulo Condore  lies about fifteen leagues to the south of the western channel of the  Cambodia  It is situated in Lat ° ′ its form is that of a crescent the length not above eight miles the greatest breadth about two the whole is lofty and mountanous and surrounded by lesser isles the name is derived from  Pulo  an isle and  Condore  a calabash from its production of that fruit It is mentioned by a captain  Saris  an  Englishman  who sailed by it in in his way from  Japan  The harbor is between the greater island and a lesser called the  little  Condore  lying off the north end in which is sufficient depth of water and safe anchorage  Dampier  Voy  in careened and refitted his ship here and has given us a good account of many particulars He says that the soil is rich and black the hills craggy the eastern part of the island sandy but cloathed with trees of various kinds some of the shores are rocky others low and sandy All the islands are finely watered with small rivulets during ten months of the year which begin to fail towards the latter end of  March  in the dry season but on digging water may be found in many places  THE vegetabled observed by  Dampier  Dampier  Vol i p  were mangoes in a state of nature the  Areca Oleracea  or cabbage palm the coco palm wild nutmegs grape trees and a large tree four feet in diameter which on incision yields a clammy juice that being boiled proves an excellent tar and on farther boiling becomes hard as pitch  DAMMER PITCH  this probably is the  Dammer  Ibid Vol i p  Captain  Gore  in  Cook  's last voyage  Voy iii  adds to the list of plants water melons potatoes gourds plantains oranges shaddocks pomegranates rice and black beans These possibly were acquisitions since the days of  Dampier  and introduced by the  French  who humanely and politically wished to render these islands useful to navigators in their way to or from  Japan China Manilla Tonquin CochinChina  and many parts of  India  with which the  Europeans  have intercourse At the time Captain  Gore  visited this island a Mandarine from  Saigore  came here with a certificate in  French  from the bishop of  Adran  a  Frenchman  certifying that he was sent in order to give his assistance  to any  European  ship which might touch at this port  Dampier  recommended the erection of a fort and mentions among other advantages that ships might in this island be supplied with masts and yards possibly from the same tree which furnishes the tar and pitch  THE animals when  Dampier  resided on the island  ANIMALS  were only hogs lizards and  guanoes  Before Captain  Gore  reached  Pulo Condore  it was plentifully stocked with buffaloes transported from the continent which increase here very successfully Numbers of monkies inhabit the woods and two species of squirrels one of a beautiful shining black the other of the kind called  flying  striped brown and white and probably a new species  Gaubil  also observed rats with pendulous ears To the reptiles we add that father  Gaubil  saw here in the flying dragon or  Dracovolans  a scaly species of lizard called  Koka  from its piercing note resembling in sound that word it resides in hollow trees its bite is mortal From these circumstances I suspect it to be the  Gekko  HERE are a variety of parrots paroquets and pigeons and in the woods numbers of poultry in a state of nature I refer the reader for a further account to page vol ii of the Outlines of the Globe The thrush called by Mr  Latham  Vol ii p  the  Longtailed  may be added to the list of birds  Dampier  found on the shores great plenty of the green turtle  TORTOISES  these he supposes to have been in a state of migration being of opinion that for want of food it is impossible for them to stay the whole year in the neighboring seas Our great navigator  found them here from the th of  March  to the st of  April  The natives of this island took them in large nets and boiled the fat for the sake of the oil  THE inhabitants of  Pulo Condore  supposed to be originally of  CochinChina  are small in stature of dark complexion long visaged with black and lank hair white teeth thin lips small eyes high noses Their religion is idolatrous they worship chiefly the elephant and the horse similar to the objects of

in his service a number of  Macassars  who were to act as soldiers to assist in building and to serve during three years At the end of the term he basely refused to fulfil his contract Those islanders remarkable for the fidelity with which they execute all their agreements are as determined to revenge any injuries offered to them in the night they put to death  Ketchpole  and most of the  English  a few on the first alarm escaped in a boat The  Macassars  regained their liberty and inflicted a most justifiable punishment on their persidious master  HERE  Dampier  's crew was welcomed by the

excepting a cloth which is wrapped round their middle they are employed in hard labor and are little better than slaves Both the  Loyes  and  Moyes  are regulated by the same laws the government is very oppressive they are punished for the least fault and among the common people that of shewing any appearance of wealth is one of the first moment the only good in the system of government is the toleration of religion Here is found a degenerated  Mahometanism  the doctrine of  Confucius  and idolatry in all the variety and extravagancy of image worship We know little of this country I am obliged to M  Mannevillette  P  for my information which he got from the captain of  La Galathea  a  French  frigate which put into one of the ports of  Ciamba  in and was detained there for some time  IN Mr  Higginson  president of  Fort St George  formed the idea of opening a trade with  Ciampa  and sent Mr  Bowyear  on a sort of embassy to the king of  CochinChina  At his court he met with the prince of this country who gave him every encouragement  and told him he might by the river  Cambodia  dispose of great quantities of woollencloth among the  Loyes  I MAY add here to my account of the river that at the mouth is never less than four fathoms of water and that it is navigable for ships of some burden up to the very capital above which small vessels only are used and the navigation is by report said to be interrupted by a cataract  ACCORDING to  D'Anville  COCHINCHINA  the kingdom of  CochinChina  unites with its tributary  Ciampa  at the bay of  Comorin  the original name is  Anam  The  Portuguese  bestowed on it the appellation it bears at present which by the help of the  Japanese  word  Cochi  signifies the country west of  China  In describing the form of this extensive stripe of empire I shall include in it its  les Pais conquis  The whole beginning from the borders of  Cambodia  is in form of a bow bending into the ocean as far as  Cape Varelle  in Lat ° ′ when it inclines to its northern extremity in Lat ° ′ The whole length of this great curvature is about six hundred and sixty miles the breadth not exceeding that we have given to  Ciampa  The northern borders are defended by a wall which runs from the sea to the great chain of mountains and forbids all approach from that quarter as the inaccessible chain itself does every attempt of invasion from their western neighbors The  Moyes  who inhabit these mountains are said to be a most savage and ferocious race  THE court of  CochinChina  is usually held at  Sinoa  a little to the south of the wall there says Mr  Bowyear  the king in his  Tongtan  or eighth moon takes his recreation with his Mandarines and forbids all interruption by petitions or any sort of business  ALL the lower part of the kingdom has its annual inundations  INUNDATED  like the other tropical countries which give it prodigious fertility  Borri  's account of the peculiarity of the floods in this kingdom is very curious The rains on the mountains during the wet season are intermittent they happen once a fortnight and last three days at a time bringing fertility and plenty to the subjacent country This rain is called  Lut  its arrival is celebrated by every one from the king to the peasant with the utmost festivity The overflowing of the  Nile  is not received in  Egypt  with greater rapture The seasons in  CochinChina  may be called four The violent heats last during  May June  and  July  the rains fall in  September October  and  November  and ab ae the violence of the sun In  December January  and  February  the cold northern winds prevale accompanied by cooling showers In  March April  and  May  all the beauties of spring appear and the fruits of every kind of vegetation bless the country  THE great harvest is that of rice  RICE  two species are cultivated on the mountanous and dry soils one as white as snow and when dressed of a slimy viscous nature made into pastes such as vermicelli and the like Both these kinds are exported to  China  in great quantities the different sorts of rice are the staples of this country  THE sugarcane is another plant to which the  CochinChinese  pay the utmost attention  SUGAR  and cultivate in vast abundance They are acquainted with most of the processes and annually manufacture great quantities of both white and brown sugars so that their country supplies  China  with the principal part of this article that vast empire not producing sufficient for its own  consumption The city of  Faifo  or  Foy Foe  is the  emporium  from which the  Chinese  annually export about forty thousand barrels each weighing above two thousand pounds To the credit of these orientalists all the cultivation and all the posterior processes in the production of the sugar is the voluntary labor of freemen  To these articles of commerce may be added woods of different kinds such as aloes wood or  Agollocha  AGOLLOCHA  erroneously called  Eaglewood Columba  and others of value either in mechanics or for their sweet scent  COLUMBA WOODS  The price of  Columba  wood on the very spot is five ducats a pound at the ports sixteen and in  Japan  to which much is exported two hundred A pillow of this wood is the highest luxury with the orientalists particularly the  Japanese  who will give three or four hundred ducats per pound for a piece big enough for that purpose The  Agollocha  bears a good price great quantities being shipped for  Hindoostan  for the use of the  Hindoos  to burn their dead who seem to emulate the antient  Romans  in the aromatic profusion of their funeral piles  PEPPER grows here in abundance  PEPPER  Le Poivre  and  Raynal  mention that cinnamon superior to that of  Ceylon  is found on a certain mountain for which the  Chinese  pay a higher price than for that brought from the famous staple of that spice  Cassia  is another spice let me question whether the two are not confounded  COTTON is much cultivated as is the mulberry tree  COTTON  for the use of the silkworms great quantities of coarse silks are made here some so strong as to serve for sails and cordage but the finest sorts also are manufactured The imposing  Chinese  export  from hence the fibres of a tree called  Pitre  which they fraudulently mix with their own manufactures they even import into their land of tea a course and black sort possibly for the sake of enabling them to export their own at greater profit into our island The mountains yield some gold and much iron the natives fuse the last and employ the metal in various manufactories raw and wrought silk may be added to the articles of commerce  THE  Portuguese  had once considerable influence in the court of  CochinChina  the  Dutch  made a strong effort to come in for a share of the commercial emoluments but were expelled the kingdom by the superior interest of their rivals At present it is said that the trade is chiefly in the hands of the  Japanese  and  Chinese  who are settled at  Foy Foe  and preserve their own laws religion and customs The harbors are still casually frequented by  European  ships but I think their imports inconsiderable  THE chief port is that of  Foy Foe  PORT OF FOY FOE  some miles up a navigable river The entrance has before it at a little distance the isles of  Champellos  the channel between the mouths and the town is filled with islands and obstructed by a bar but not unsurmountable Ships of some burden formerly have been brought over and then were obliged to anchor before the customhouse which was the case with Mr  Bowyear  The town consists but of two rows of houses inhabited by  Chinese  and a few  Japanese  the first of whom manage the trade and import various articles from  Canton Siam Camboja Batavia  and  Manilla Bowyear  met with encouragement to settle a factory near the city but I believe it never was carried into effect  THIS country is certainly very favorable to trade and navigation having not fewer than sixty safe harbors and a great depth of water in every part  THE gallies or shipping of the  CochinChinese  are very numerous  SHIPPING  part allotted to the defence of the coast are finely painted and highly varnished rowed with fifty oars and carry a cannon at the head and two small ones on each side Notwithstanding the  CochinChinese  can neither cast cannon or make fusils their dexterity says Mr  Borri  Churchill's Col vl ii  in the art of gunnery is amazing not one of our  Europeans  dare enter the list with them The navy of this country is quickly manned every family being bound to furnish a sailor who serves with great alacrity for they are well treated and their wives and children supported during their absence all are dressed in an uniform and when they are about to engage put on a gilt helmet and a cloak which leaves their right arm quite bare Numbers of their vessels are employed in the fisheries the fish are found in vast abundance and form a great article of commerce fish and rice constitute the principal food of the  CochinChinese  THE woods and mountains afford all the variety of birds and quadrupeds of the adjacent kingdoms  ELEPHANTS  tigers swarm elephants are in great abundance and of vast size these are taken and reclamed numbers are kept in the royal stables merely for ostentation being no longer used in war they are rendered of infinite service to the inhabitants of the country as beasts of burden the carriers both by land and water I may say the stage coaches and ferries of  CochinChina  On their backs is  placed a machine like the body of a coach reckoning the outside as well as inside they convey thirteen or fourteen passengers when they arrive at a river they take the water very readily and will even carry their fare in perfect safety over an arm of the sea a mile wide  A GREAT monkey called here the  Douc  MONKEY  by me the  CochinChina  Hist Quad ii N  o  is found of the length of four feet exclusive of the tail The tail and lower parts of the arms are pure white the crown upper parts of the arms and thighs black buttocks clothed with hair round the neck a collar of purplish brown the face bordered up to the eyes with a great yellowish beard It is also found in  Madagascar  where it is called  Sifac  it walks often erect its food beans  I BEG not to be understood to favor the doctrine of some systemmakers by connecting the description of the monkey of  CochinChina  with that of the man I readily allow changelings or artificial monkies among our species but none that are natural we have also our bears As to the men of this country they greatly resemble the  Chinese  from whom they are distantly sprung they are featured exactly like them but are less in body more active and more valiant the complexion of those on the coast is olive that of the inland or alpine inhabitants is fairer and not inferior to that of  Europeans  IT is this country that produces in such quantities the  edible birds  nests held by the epicure of the East to be the first of delicacies It is chiefly made use of in soups and ragouts of chickens the nests are first softened in water pulled to pieces and mixed with ginseng put into the body of the fowl The  above is then to be stewed in a pot with a sufficient quantity of water and left on the coals the whole night The best kinds which are white and quite pure from dirt are dissolved in broths in order to thicken them and to give them that flavor the Orientalists so much admire Of the black and foul nests is made glue  MR  Latham  Vol ii  gives the following account  It weighs about half an ounce and is in shape like half a lemon or as some compare it to that of a saucer with one side flatted where it adheres to the rock The texture of it is somewhat like  Isinglass  or rather more like fine  Gumdragon  and the several layers of the matter it is composed of very apparent being fabricated from repeated parcels of a soft slimy substance in the same manner as the martins form theirs of mud Authors differ much as to the materials of which it is composed some suppose it to consist of  seaworms  of the  Mollusca  class others of the  seaqualm  a kind of cuttle fish or a glutinous seaplant called  Agal Agal  It has also been supposed that they rob other birds of their eggs and after breaking the shells apply the white of them for that purpose  THESE nests are found in vast numbers in certain caverns in various isles in the  Soolo Archipelago  situated between Longitude ° and ′ Lat and particularly in three small isles or rather rocks in the caverns of which the nests are found fixed to the sides in astonishing numbers They are also found in amazing quantities on a small island called  Toc  in the streights of  Sunda  the caverns of which are lined with the nests but no where in greater abundance than about  Croee  near the south end of  Sumatra  four miles up a river of that name but they are not peculiar to the above places for they are likewise common from  Java  to  CochinChina  on the north and from the point of  Sumatra  west where it is called  Layung  to  New Guinea  on the east where the sea is said to be covered with a viscous substance like half melted glue which the bird is supposed either to take up from the surface with its bill during flight or to pick it from the rocks when left there by the waves  THE best nests or those of a pure white and free from mixture sell in  China  from to dollars the  picle  the black and dirty ones for only twenty dollars The last are supposed to arise from age mixed with dirt or feathers and the gatherers beat down all the black ones they can get at in hopes that from the necessity of the birds making fresh nests they may meet with the more valuable ones at the next gathering It is said that the  Dutch  alone export from  Batavia  picles of these nests every year which are brought from the isles of  CochinChina  and those lying to the east of them Among our  East India  imports it is much to be wondered that among other luxuries imported by us from the East the use of these nests should not have found a way to our tables as yet being so scarce in  England  as to be kept as rarities in the cabinets of collectors  THE king resides generally at  Whay  WHAY THE KING'S COURT  in Lat ° ′ north  about twentyfive miles from the sea on a river navigable for vessels of fifty or sixty tons up to the city but the bar has on it at low water only four feet The city is extensive the palace a large square the streets near it wide long and regular the rest of the city consists of straggling houses several branches of the river meet here every family keeps its covered boat and there are numbers besides kept for hire for most of the conveyance is by water It is a place of great trade both from  Kankao  and all parts of their own coasts  THE celebrated M  Le Poivre  was here in and appeared at court with great splendor  Oriental Repertory  bearing a letter from the king of  France  and some very paltry gifts for the  CochinChinese  monarch  Le Poivre  was too open and boasted so much of his  Grand Monarque  that his veracity was called in question and in the end he and his countrymen forced to make a hasty retreat  THE government of  CochinChina  is monarchical  GOVERNMENT OF COCHINCHINA  It had once been a province to  Tonquin  but was separated from it in the beginning of the last century The story is differently related I refer the reader to  Hamilton  's account  Vol ii  of the cause and manner  Le Poivre  relates it differently yet both may be right in the chief circumstances of the event The ruling religion is that of the  Chinese  not the pure and primaeval worship of the  Shangti  the patriarchal religion but that of  China  in its corrupted state Christianity introduced by the  Portuguese  during the time of their favor at the court of  CochinChina  got ground for some little time missionaries were sent churches  erected and multitudes of converts made At length a king arose unfriendly to our doctrine who expelled the missionaries and compelled his subjects to return within the pale of the national church Having premised this I shall treat the reader with  Le Poivre  's elegant account of the revolution and the happy state of this kingdom but I must mix my fears with it that as he hints at corruptions creeping fast into the original system of government it may be found at present as absolute as tyrannical and as absurd as other eastern dominions under the rule of the infirm individual To begin  A  Tonquinese  prince unsuccessful in a war he carried on against the king of  Tonquin  under whom he enjoyed an office somewhat resembling the  Maires de palais  under the  Merovingian  race of the kings of  France  retired with his soldiers and adherents across the river which divides that kingdom from  CochinChina  The savages who then possessed this country fled before these strangers and took refuge among the mountains of  Tsiampa  After a long war with their old enemies who pursued them the  Tonquinese  fugitives remained at length peaceable possessors of the country known under the name of  CochinChina  it extends about two hundred leagues from north to south but narrow and unequal from east to west They then applied themselves entirely to the cultivation of rice which being the ordinary food of the inhabitants of  Asia  is to them an object of the greatest importance They separated into little cantonments and established themselves on the plains which extend along the banks of the rivers  THE six first kings founders of this monarchy governed the nation as a father governs his family they established the laws of nature alone they themselves paid the first obedience to them Chiefs of an immense family of laborers they gave the first example of labor they honored and encouraged agriculture as the most useful and honorable employment of mankind They required from their subjects only a small annual freegift to defray the expence of their defensive war against their  Tonquinese  enemies  OFF the coast of  CochinChina  are the  Paracels  THE PARACELS  a vast tract of rocks reefs sandbanks and small isles extending from north to south from Lat ° ′ N to ° ′ N two hundred and seventysix miles in length and sixty in breadth To the northeast of the northern end is a group of small reefs and rocks called the  Triangles  and again a little to the southeast of that is a great irregularly shaped shoal called the  Macclesfield  shoal Between these and the isle of  Hainan  belonging to  China  is clear and deep water That island lies to the north about one hundred and thirty miles from the nearest extremity of the  Paracels  the interval is the common passage of our ships bound for  China  they sail between the coast of  CochinChina  and the  Paracels  till they get sight of the  Campellos  isles in Lat ° ′ From thence they cross over towards  Hainan  which is strongly marked by several very high and craggy mountains foresights of the general nature of the great empire  Tinhosa  is the next point navigators make for a small but lofty isle not remote from  Hainan  and from thence is a direct and clear course to the islands of  Sanciam  a little beyond  which is that of  Macao  and the numerous isles that bound the channels to the great port of  Canton  THE bay of  Tonquin  begins near the wall of  CochinChina  BAY OF TONQUIN  and at the northern extremity of that kingdom The entrance is bounded on the eastern side by the island of  Hainan  The middle of the bay has very deep water and is free from isles excepting a small one called the  Nachtigael  but the shores are skirted with sands or groups of little isles the coasts themselves according to  Dampier  very low and the whole interior a flat of the richest soil productive of all the fruits and possibly vegetables of the tropics Pastures or rice ground border the banks of the most considerable rivers  THE great orange  Camchain  has a thick rind and rough  FRUITS  the inside of an amber color the smell is most fragrant the taste most delicious  THE  Camquit  is very small round and of a deep red The taste is equal to the former but is esteemed a more unwholesome fruit as it both creates and heightens the disorder of the flux The limes are equal in size to lemons The  betel  is said to surpass any of the  Indian  THE mulberry is much cultivated here for the nourishment of the silkworms  MULBERRY  There is a succession of them for the leaves of the old trees are held to be less nutritive to the worm and productive of worse silk The species of  Morus  is generally supposed to be the white  THE  Rhus Vernix  is found here and in several other parts of  India citra Gangem  RHUS VERNIX  It is the valuable tree which yields the varnish so useful in the lacquering of variety of things and giving  them a sort of immortality the best is in  Japan  The reader may satisfy his curiosity further by consulting  Thunberg Flora Japon  p  Koempfer  's travels i and his  Amaen Acad  fig  Kalm  Vol i  found it in  North America  and mentions it under the name of the  poison  tree It certainly merits the title but its effects are not general some persons can receive its juice on the body or hands without the least ill consequence while others are afflicted with violent swelling acute pains and blisters so numerous that the patient will resemble a leper and his very skin peel off some people are even struck with blindness for two days together much depends on the constitutions of those affected There are men that will handle the tree or touch the juice with impunity while others will be visited with all the deleterious symptoms by being in the way of the smoke or even of the wind which carries the effluvia or exhalations of this singular tree  IT has been observed that the workers in  Laquer  or  Japan  feel the bad effects being subject to violent eruptions in form of boils or blotches The laborers can only work in the dry season when the north winds blow They are obliged to lay several coats on each of which must have time to dry before the other is applied The varnish is brought to market in great tubs all the working season the natural color is white and thick like cream but changes in the air and becomes blackish  Dampier  says that the  Tonquinese  have the art of making of it a glue the best in the world  IN this kingdom are abundance of sir and poon trees  both which are very serviceable for masts The country also produces  Sappan  wood  SAPPAN WOOD  which  Dampier  compares to the  Logwood  of  Campeachy  It proves to be the  Caju Sappan  or  Lignum Sapan  of  Rumphius  iv tab xxi  Ligno Brasiliano Simile Bauhin Pin    Caesalpina Sappan  Syst Pl ii  Loureiro  Fl loch This tree grows principally in  Siam  and  Ciamba  is of the first use in  India  for the dying of red  Rumphius  gives a very full account of the means by which it produces a tinge of different shades It is also brought to the  European  market It grows to a moderate size the branches are thick set with short spines The wood is very hard and much used by the  Indians  for pegs to fasten the boards of their ships This plant has been introduced into the  Kew garden  and is described by Mr  Aiton  Hort Kew ii  under the name of  Caesalpina vesicaria  narrowleaved prickly Brasiletto  THE zoology of  Tonquin  would give a most plentiful harvest here seems to be a continuation of most of the animals of the countries of  India  we have passed over  ELEPHANTS  The elephants are generally in a state of nature they are very wild and shy but when taken their flesh is eagerly sought after the trunk is a peculiar dainty The king keeps a few for state when one happens to die the flesh is given to the poor and the trunk cut to pieces and sent to the mandarines horseflesh is also frequently brought to market This favors of Tartarian origin  THE variety of birds  BIRDS  terrestrial and aquatic is incredible The water fowl pair before  May  and fly in pairs during the months of  June  and  July  From  October  to  March  they collect in vast  flocks The  Tonquinese  take them in nets set on poles which the birds strike on in the twilight  FISH is in equal abundance  SOYA SAUCE  That delicate sauce we call  Soya  is made here of one species and of a sort of shrimp is produced another relishing luxury called  Balichaun  THE chief river of the country is called the river of  Tonquin  which empties itself into the bay by two channels one called  Rokho  the other twenty leagues to the northeast which  Dampier  named that of  Domea  The first frequented by the smaller vessels has not above twelve feet water at the entrance and is the most convenient for the  Siamese  and  Chinese  The other is used by the  European  ships on account of the depth Before the mouth is a line of hard sand two miles long the entrance is distinguished by a high ridgy mountain far up the country called the  Elephant  About six leagues from the mouth of the river is the village of  Domea  usually consisting of a hundred houses yet on the arrival of the  European  ships it soon increases to a large town the natives resort for sake of trade from all parts houses suddenly spring up for being only constructed of frames of bamboo and the roof of palm or other leaves a temporary town is quickly formed in which a fair is kept as long as the ships remain in the harbor  THE river is subject to the same periodical floods as others in the tropical regions and the same fertility is the consequence The wet season commences the latter end of  April  or beginning of  May  and lasts till towards the close of  August  The rains are intermittent some are of two or three days continuance others of only a few hours with intervals of fine weather especially  towards the beginning and conclusion of the season During the wet months the heat is intolerable especially when the sun can force its rays through the thick clouds  THE  Typhons  TYPHONS  or as  Dampier  calls them  Tuffoons  are most tremendous in this bay and on the coast of  China  They prevale in the months of  July August  and  September  and commonly near the change of the moon They are preceded by very fine weather a presaging cloud appears in the northeast black near the horizon edged with copper color on the upper part fading into a glaring white It often exhibits a ghastly appearance twelve hours before the  Typhon  bursts its rage lasts many hours from the northeast attended with dreadful claps of thunder large and frequent flashes of lightning and excessive hard rains then it sinks into a dead clam after which it begins again with redoubled rage from the southwest and continues an equal length of time  THE great  Halley  gives an account of the surprising tides in this bay  TIDES  each flux is of twelve hours duration and its reflux the same so that there occurs but one high water in twentyfour hours The great Philosopher shall speak in his own words  ON the first and second days at the water's increase the influxes are very small and uncertain but afterwards the tides for thirteen days are constant in their course one flood and one ebbing being completed in twentyfour hours time equally sharing the space of a lunar circuition of the earth between them and every flood beginning nearest three quarters of an hour later than the precedent flood and also considerably increasing in the height of the tide every day from the third unto  the sixth and seventh days of the water's age on which two days the flood runs very high but on the eighth day which may be accounted the last of the spring tides the waters begin gradually to decrease again retaining the same orderly difference of time in each tide until the next following first day of the water's increase when during two days unsettledness there is a shifting of the tides in respect of the beginning of the flood and ebb after which said shifting a constancy in their inverted course is again retained in the above mentioned order for thirteen days following  Cachao  the principal city of  Tonquin  CITY OF CACHAO  lies about eighty miles higher up the river and is the place where the chief trade is carried on The imports are conveyed from the ships in large  Tonquinese  boats navigated by the natives The tide runs with great rapidity thirty or forty miles above  Domea  through a rich and beautiful plain near  Hean  a town of two thousand houses is the place where the two channels meet and form the  Delta  of  Tonquin  about eighty miles from the sea The  Chinese  merchants have a street to themselves at  Hean  For a time they resided at  Cachao  but became so numerous that they seemed to swallow up the very natives the king therefore ordered them to remove here The  French  also had a factory in this town in  Dampier  's time Is is from that honest voyager I take my account having no later authority of any authenticity The  Chinese  and  Siamese  jonks come up as high as the town and ride in the middle of the river  Cachao  is a city of twenty thousand houses the walls usually made of mud and thatch but some are of brick covered with  tiles Here are three regal places two very mean the third more magnificent but built of timber and open at the sides This with the courts fishponds and docks for the pleasure boats take up a vast space of ground surrounded by a wall faced with brick There are several gates and stairs to ascend to the top of the walls round which is a pleasant walk This place is the residence or rather prison of the  Boua  or emperor of  Tonquin  In this country is a most singular government by a revolution which happened long ago the general of the reigning monarch made himself master of the empire he assumed all the regal power and seized the whole revenue but did not venture to extirpate the royal family for fear of the affection the people entertained for their antient rulers The executive power is lodged in the general or his heirs who is called  Choua  he is quite absolute has his guards and all the insignia of majesty The  Boua  is kept as a state prisoner with his wives and children and diverts himself within the palace walls for he is never allowed to stir out The  Choua  pays him all external respects visits him three times a year gives him the precedence makes him a tender of his life and services and declares that all he does is in kindness to save him the fatigues of government The  Choua  places his own creatures about him and no others are permitted to have access  THE  English  and  Dutch  have or had factories in this city  FACTORIES  I am not well acquainted with the exports of the country they are said to be gold woods for dying raw and wrought silk some callicoes varnish turpentine salt earthen ware anniseed and drugs of several kinds pearls are also found on the coasts  THE royal navy is an affair of state useless and contemptible in wars and as to ships of commerce there are scarcely any so that every thing is brought in and out of the kingdom in foreign bottoms  I MAY be pardoned for digressing to the healing art of the  Tonquinese  TONQUIN MEDICINE  I must produce their receipt for the cure of the bite of the mad dog the gaol distemper and other maladies incident to human nature let the good intent apologize for the following extract thought worthy of a place in the eleventh volume  P  of the Philosophical Transactions  THEY  the Tonquinese  take of the best musk about gr xvi of the purest native cinnabar and finest vermillion each about gr xxiv and having reduced them separately to impalpable powders mix and administer them in about a gill of arrack which in two or three hours generally throws the patient into a sound sleep and perspiration if not they repeat the dose and think the cure certain  THE religion of this country is the same with that of  CochinChina  RELIGION  but idolatry appears here with much less magnificence the  Pagodas  are mean and their images numerous It should seem that the  Mandarines  and better sort of people are more enlightened and confine themselves to the worship of one GOD They do not frequent the pagodas they have no idols but adore the supreme in their courts with uplifted eyes A person of the family reads the petition to heaven  Dampier  's  Vol ii  account of the ceremony is curious "When they make this petition" says he  they order a great deal of good meat to be dressed and calling  all their servants into the court where the ceremony is to be performed they place the food on a table where also two incensepots are placed and then the mandarine presents a paper to the clerk who reads it with an audible voice In the first place there is drawn up an ample account of all that GOD has blest him withal as health riches honor favor of his prince c and long life if he be old and towards the conclusion there is a petition to GOD for a continuance of all these blessings and a further augmentation of them especially with long life and favor of his prince which last they esteem as the greatest of all blessings While this paper is reading the master kneels down and bows his face to the earth and when the clerk has done reading it he puts it to the burning rushes that are in the incensepot where it is consumed then he flings in three or four little bundles of sacred paper which is very fine and gilded and when that also is burnt he bids his servants eat the meat  IT is singular that in matters relative to their oaths of allegiance  OATH  a species of sacrament is annually performed at the season in which the  Mandarines  receive from the great officers under them the oath of fidelity to the king this is attended with the following ceremony they cut the throat of a hen and let the blood fall into a bason of arrack of which every man has a small portion given him to drink after he has publicly declared his loyalty and zeal to serve his prince and this is esteemed the most solemn tie by which any person can engage himself  THE Christian religion made considerable progress in this kingdom about the year  MISSIONARIES  and some time after Here were  two bishops one styled of  Ascalon  the other of  Adran  but neither they nor the priests were suffered to come to  Cachao  their residence being fixed at  Hean  the proselytes they made were among the meanest of the people and it is suggested were gained over more by the charitable donations of rice in times of scarcity than by any arguments of the pious missionaries The priests were all masters of some mechanic arts which were useful in this country and which seem to have been the grounds of their toleration By reason of some imprudence on their part or some spirit of persecution in the reigning powers they were at length expelled and four of the principal missionaries put to death by decapitation  I WILL conclude with the extent of the kingdom of  Tonquin  EXTENT  and with a brief account of the inhabitants It commences towards the south at the  CochinChina  wall and is there very narrow to the west it is bounded by the  CochinChinese  chain which soon retires and gradually leaves a larger and larger expanse to the great plain of this kingdom These mountains keeping to the northwest unite with those of  China  and by their branches turning eastward constitute the boundaries between  Tonquin  and the mighty empire of which the  Tonquinese  seem originally to have been a colony The western limit is at the river  Gannan Kyan  in Lat ° ′  THE province bordering on  China  on the side of the bay is that of  Tenan  small but extremely fertile in rice off the coast are multitudes of isles very properly called by the  Dutch  the  Islands of Pirates  They are inhabited by fishermen who make no scruple of robbing every ship they can master Those can  only be of the most defenceless kind for these pirates have no other vessels than the boats in which they carry on the fishing business and those unprovided with any sort of firearms From the extreme corruption of the government there is no redress to be obtained against their excesses An  English  captain has been fined for killing one of the crew of these petty thieves which had shewed a design of attacking his vessel  IN one of the isles the  Tonquinese  have a customhouse which is said to bring in a million of rixdollars  THE kingdom is very populous  NATIVES  being thick set with villages The natives generally are of a middle stature of the tawny  India  color but the fairest and clearest of the kind a blush or change of tint may be seen in some of them on any surprise of passion imperceptible in any other  Indians  their faces are flattish and oval their noses and lips of due proportions and altogether agreeable their hair black long and lank very thick and hanging down to their shoulders  THEIR teeth are like those of the  Siamese  as black as art can make them  BLACK TEETH  the dying occupies three or four days and is done to both boys and girls when they are about twelve or fourteen years old during the whole operation they never take any nourishment except of the liquid kind for fear of being poisoned by the pigment if they swallowed what required mastication Every person high and low rich and poor is obliged to undergo this severe operation alledging it would be a disgrace to human nature to have teeth white as those of dogs or elephants to which they compare those who labor under that misfortune  Prior  with his usual humour mentions this custom but transfers it to the  Chinese  In  China  none hold women sweet  Unless their snags are black as jet  King  Chihu  put nine queens to death  Convict on statute iv'ry teeth  THUS ends my account of  India extra Gangem  The  Tonquinese  have so much similitude with the  Chinese  that it is with some reluctance I place them as a separate people The uniformity of manners the religion and even the personal appearance begin to shew themselves far more to the south The  Chinese  had spread themselves to many of the kingdoms we have passed over and the likeness is retained in proportion as they kept distinct or mixed with the natives so as to occasion a deviation from their native features and national customs We fall in with the general arrangement of geographers and leave the artificial distinctions which separate them from that great empire whence they originated The antients thought otherwise and formed of those kingdoms a mighty government distinguished from their neighbors to the south and to the north by the general name of  Thinae  or  Sinae  CHINA  CHINA  THE miracle of governments  GOVERNMENT  Its dominion extends from the streights of  Hainan  in north Lat ° ′ to the extremity of the province of  Pecheli  in Lat ° ′ comprehending a space of near fifteen hundred miles in length and in breadth above a thousand The numbers of its inhabitants given by the lively  Voltaire  are a hundred and fifty millions  The more accurate information obtained by Lord Macartney's embassy makes the population of  China  Proper amount to inhabiting a space of square miles E  yet all are ruled by a single man The government is founded on the law of the  fifth commandment  and the honor paid to the emperor in the character of father amounts to a veneration due to the Divinity himself The greatest of his subjects never speak to him without kneeling his words are law and every thing he says is received as oracular The same respect proportionably diminished is rendered to all his servants as emanations of his sacred person from the first mandarine down to the lowest officer who is invested with delegated power He is called  Tyentse  the son of Heaven  Thauting  palace royal  Vanswi  ten thousand years and by other epithets emblematic of the  sanctity of his person All this results primarily from the sense of filial duties early imprinted on the hearts of his subjects as the first and greatest point of religion and objects of the cognizance of the magistrate If a son is incorrigible by a parent the parent takes him before the judge who seldom fails to bring him to a sense of his duty Filial respect says  Confucius  in his  Auking  a book on that very subject is the foundation of all virtue and of the wise government of the empire  CHILDREN are treated by the parents with the utmost rigor the doctrine of obedience is inculcated with the greatest severity so that it becomes ever after habitual but as this respect towards their superiors is attended with fear and meanness so deceit and fraud become the characteristics of the  Chinese  nation  THE same respect to those in a higher station pervades all ranks of people hence the  Chinese  are the most ceremonious of mankind and the very lowest orders full of the most profound artificial civility  THE emperor has the disposal of all offices nay even of the lives and fortunes of every subject Nothing is done of any moment from one extremity to the other of this vast empire without his knowledge in criminal cases the calendar of prisoners convict are laid before him with a statement of their crimes these lists are returned to the respective judges with the sentence affixed to each name be it of death or free pardon The lesser punishments are left to the pleasure of the magistrate  THE despotism of the emperor is founded upon law and custom  DESPOTIC  not expressed yet fully implied it seems admitted that  he can do no wrong but it is on the principle that the state is a vast family that  Tyen i e  the Supreme Being hath placed him on the throne in order that he may be a father and a mother to his people In consequence of this a strong sense of his duty is continually before his eyes The mandarines and princes of the blood are at liberty to remind him of any faults he may fall into and even the people if they find him negligent are as ready to become tumultuous as in any other country The grand secret of government in the emperor is the unremitting attention paid to the conduct of the mandarines and other magistrates who are carefully watched and most severely punished on every failure of duty He himself is perpetually anxious to consult the good of his subjects and to avoid incurring their hatred or contempt  THERE is no country in which the filial duties are carried to such a length  FILIAL DUTIES  "A veneration for fathers" says  Montesquieu  Spirit of Laws vol i p    was necessarily connected with a suitable respect for all who represented fathers such as old men masters magistrates and the emperor This respect for fathers supposed a return of love towards children and consequently the same return from old men to the young from magistrates to those who were under their jurisdiction and from the emperor to his subjects This formed the rites and these rites the general spirit of the nation  A PARRICIDE is extremely rare in this empire whenever it happens the whole province is in alarm the relations are punished and the mandarines deposed as it is presumed it must  have been through their neglect of admonition on the first appearance of filial misconduct that such a monster could be found The emperor himself is judge and the crime is expiated by the sentence of the criminal being cut into ten thousand pieces  THE reigning vice of the  Chinese  is selfinterest  SELFINTEREST  which gives rise to the infinite variety of frauds of which they are justly accused Lord  Anson  's account of them is by no means exaggerated Attempts have been made to clear them from the aspersion but all has proved a vain labor They consider the art of overreaching as a mark of superior genius and laugh at their dupe for suffering himself to be imposed on  Du Halde  tells a pleasant story of an  English  captain who had bargained with a  Chinese  merchant for several bales of silk On opening the first he found it excellent but all the rest were quite rotten The captain reproached the merchant in the most severe terms The  Chinese  with great coolness answered  Blame Sir your rogue of an interpreter for he assured me that you never would examine the bales  PRIDE and selfconceit are the other characteristic faults of this people  PRIDE  They assume an imaginary preeminence over all the world and conceive nothing can be right but what they do Their arts and their inventions have been brought to a certain point at which they must ever stop till they can prevale on themselves to lower their high opinion of superiority and improve upon the models brought from  Europe  They can copy but they do it with reluctance as they look upon themselves to be the first of men A good effect arises out of this  foible it represses luxury they think themselves wiser than the rest of mankind and that they are supplied with whatever their situation can require Their rule of government their customs their arts their habits have remained for centuries the same and probably will continue so to the end of time  THIS leading feature is besides  ANTIQUITY  the result of the high and just opinion they entertain of the antiquity of the  Chinese  nation in comparison of that of the rest of the world and they with truth observe that they were a polished people ages before the nations of modern  Europe  had emerged from savage manners and profound ignorance  THE founder of their empire is said to be  Fohi  FOHI FOUNDER OF THE EMPIRE  cotemporary with  Phaleg  and  Heber  His subjects at that time were nearly in the state of nature they fed on what they caught ate it raw drank the blood and clothed themselves with the skins He taught them to make fishingnets and snares for birds to rear domestic animals and instructed them in various arts of life and to soften the fierceness of his people invented music and the instrument  Kin China  was inhabited above two thousand years before the Christian aera demonstrable from an eclipse observed at that period The boast of the  Chinese  is that their monarchy has continued four thousand years under the government of emperors that it experienced twentytwo dynasties or revolutions but the commotions each occasioned were so short that the country suffered very little inconveniency and returned immediately into its former regular system  THE original religion of the  Chinese  was truly pure  RELIGION  and probably delivered to them by the first founder of the empire  Fohi  as derived from the patriarchs amongst whom that illustrious character may nearly be ranked The first who reached  China  brought with them the religion of  Noah  They acknowledged one great and supreme Being and professed to live according to his laws engraven on their hearts They justly made that Being the model of perfection possessed of omnipotence omniscience providence goodness justice and mercy They admit the doctrine of grace for they say that the most wicked man if he makes use of the assistance offered to him by  Tyen  or the Supreme Being may attain the highest virtues They hold also an expiation of sins by their own sacrifices but confess that no external adoration will be accepted unless it is attended with inward sentiments and comes directly from the heart I cannot in my contracted plan give all the detail of their religion or the proofs of its origin from the patriarchs I will only say that like them they had their  Pentateuch  Their  five volumes  correspondent with the  Mosaical  history are esteemed by them the source of all science and morality  The great reformer of the religion of  China  was  Consucius  CONFUCIUS  cotemporary with  Pythagoras  and born years before Christ he purged it from all corruptions and brought it to the perfection we have described it still continues the religion of the emperor and of the good and learned throughout his vast dominions  ABOUT six hundred years before the Christian aera  SECT OF TAUTSE  arose the sect of  Tautse  founded by  Laukyun  who confined the felicity of this life to voluptuousness and taught that the soul died with the body yet at the same time admitted the existence of a Divine Being which makes some people believe that his doctrine  had been corrupted by certain of his profligate disciples who might think it better to perish than burn yet as they must necessarily be perpetually disturbed with the thoughts of death they pretended to have invented a liquor of immortality which with the credulity of some of the emperors gave a prodigious increase to their followers they were greatly addicted to magic introduced worship of spirits sacrificed to devils and deluded the vulgar by a thousand juggling tricks  THE last was the sect of  Fo  or  Fwe  not to be confounded with the great  Fohi    SECT OF FO  Their doctrine was transported out of  India  about years after the birth of Christ An emperor dreamed of a saying of  Confucius  that the  Holyone  was to be found in the West He sent ambassadors to  India  who brought back the monstrous image  Fo  and all the extravagances of the  Hindoo  mythology Temples or pagodas were erected in all places and those filled with the most monstrous idols They were attended by  Bonzees  innumerable This is the religion of the vulgar but not always confined to them the emperors have at times been infected with it deceived by the seeming austerities practised by the  Bonzees  and their senseless penances similar to those of some of the  Indian Faquirs  THE Christian religion was introduced here as early as the year when to the astonishment of the  Chinese  CHRISTIANITY  there appeared among them a set of men with fair hair and blue eyes and of an air form and habit quite unknown These proved to be certain bishops priests and deacons sent out of  Judea  to propagate the gospel in these distant parts They were  Syrians  and  Nestorians  At that time  Jesuiabas  says  Mosheim  Vol ii p  was at the head of that sect The memory of this transaction was quite lost for ages till in the year a monument was found in digging under ground near  Singansu  in the province  Shensi  It was a table of marble ten feet long and five broad containing the names of the missionaries and a history of the cause of their coming written in the  Syriac  language which was translated by the Jesuits who happened to be in  China  at the time of its discovery and is given in  Kircher  's  China Illustrata  There is no doubt of the authenticity The Jesuits are charged with a most useless and unavaling forgery especially by  Voltaire  The curious may see more of the affair in  Renaudot  's account of  India  and  China  Trans Pt ii p et seq  The effect of this mission did not continue long at first they made abundance of proselytes they were favored by the reigning emperor permitted to build churches and inculcate their doctrine among his subjects This monument brings down their history to the time of its being made In the year an emperor inimical to the monastic life arose and by an ordinance entirely suppressed every religious house This was in fact levelled at the  Bonzees  and the professors of the idolatry of  Fo  or  Fwe  who had not only expended vast sums in the ornaments of their pagodas and monasteries  CONVENTS  but made them sanctuaries for all kinds of profligates This event corresponds exactly with our celebrated dissolution here four thousand six hundred of the great monasteries of male and female recluses and forty thousand of the lesser were directed to be demolished the lands and revenues to revert to the royal  domain and a hundred and fifty thousand slaves belonging to the houses to be set at liberty enrolled and ranked among the people As to these Christians who in the ordinance are called outlandish  Bonzees  from  Tatsing  or  Muhupa  about three thousand in number they were also included and directed to return to a secular life "to the end that the customs of our empire" says the decree "may be uniform and unmixed" From this time the history of these people was consigned to oblivion nor ever would have been known but for the discovery of the  Signansu  monument  THE ambition of the great Jesuit St  ST FRANCIS DE XAVIER  Francis de Xavier  to extend the power and importance of his new order is mentioned largely at vol i p of this work  IN he sailed from  Goa  to  Japan  and after discharging his mission in that island determined on a visit to  China  Death frustrated his pious design but preserved him from the mortification of being refused an entrance into the empire according to the most rigid ordinances then in force He departed this life off the isle of  Sancian  The  Chinese  had no objection to receive a dead christian they permitted his interment his coffin was filled with unslacked lime which miraculously lost its nature and the body preserved uninjured was found entire sweet and with all moisture fifty years after  Du Halde  says only as many months and brought with due veneration to the city of  Goa  FROM this period to the end of the same century  JESUITS  no attempt was made to follow the great example of St  Xavier  A few  Dominicans  and  Franciscans  would have landed in  China  with the same pious intention could they have obtained leave The honor of preaching the gospel with any success in this great empire was reserved for the rising order of the Jesuits  Valignon  superior general of the order of the mission of  India  resident at  Macao  burning with zeal for the great design selected three of his society for the purpose  Roger  of  Naples Pasio  of  Bologna  FATHER RICCI  and  Ricci  of  Macerata  The last was a man of superior abilities who with his two brethren had rendered themselves masters of the  Chinese  language at  Goa  before they began their mission They entered on it in the year After several unfavorable essays  Ricci  found his way to the court he had all the art and insinuation of his order a noble air great sweetness of temper and an extensive knowlege of the sciences particularly of the mathematics He came also provided with presents he gave the emperor a clock a picture of our Saviour and another of the Virgin each of which say the Jesuits had a most honorable place  Pasio  and  Roger  had been recalled and the whole power was vested in  Ricci  under whom crowds of subordinate Jesuits preached the gospel with the utmost success They seemed to have a toleration or at least a connivance They reconciled the doctrine of their great master and the rites of the Christian religion with the ceremonies of that of  China Ricci  permitted his proselytes to assist at the annual commemoration of the followers of  Consucius  and to intermingle the rites of both churches so as to gain converts innumerable He baptized several Mandarines and persous of rank among others two rich  widows one by the name of  Candida  the other that of  Agatha  The wealthy founded churches and the poor filled them with their numbers Persecutions were raised against them but the abilities of  Ricci  overcame them all He died highly respected in at  Peking  in the reign of  Van Lye  and by the order of the emperor was most honorably interred in a garden allotted for that purpose  Ricci  incontestibly merited the title he received of founder and father of the  Chinese  church  SEVERAL other Jesuits of great abilities successively supported his labors a persecution had been raised against them but luckily at the same time an invasion was threatened by the  Tartars  A Mandarine a Christian convert advised the calling in the assistance of the  Portuguese  engineers to direct the artillery the advice was taken and their success again brought the Christians into favor  FATHER  Schaal  was employed in casting of cannon  FATHER VERBIEST  and father  Verbiest  another Jesuit of first rate abilities was engaged in the same service It certainly was not the spiritual merits of the fathers that gained them the patronage of the  Chinese  emperors but their knowlege of the arts They had brethren of all prosessions painters mechanics turners watchmakers founders accomptants astronomers and masters of ordnance  Verbiest  and some of the ablest of the fathers were consulted about matters of state and by those various means became a most powerful ministry They were created Mandarines and appeared at court in a rich dress of that order with the dragon flaming on their breasts  Camhi  even issued an edict in favor of the Christian  religion Among the miracles of the times an eunuch converted fifty ladies and  Helena Taming  empress of  China  held epistolary correspondence with pope  Alexander  VIIth  UNFORTUNATELY for the Jesuits in an inundation of other missionaries poured into the empire  DOMINICANS  The  Dominicans  and the  Franciscans  were zealous to partake of the honor and share in the good work but again unluckily for both the Jesuits were more of this world their rivals of the other The last soon discovered the arts by which the Jesuits had established their power in  China  They would not condescend to preach any but the pure doctrine of Christianity an inveterate quarrel ensued among these holy men The  Dominicans  and  Franciscans  carried their complaints to  Rome  the grounds of which were discussed in the highest ecclesiastical courts and with various success The monks had the most subtile orders to counteract them The controversy lasted a hundred years bulls had been sent to  Peking  to disannul all the temporizing compliances of the Jesuits with the religious rites of the  Chinese  some they evaded and at other times by their power at court excited persecutions against their christian brethren They even procured the imprisonment of  Tournon  a legate from the Pope himself His holiness honored the sufferer with the cardinal's hat he received it in consinement and soon after died the ridicule of the political Jesuits The reader will find a very candid and entertaining account of the Christian church by  Moshcim  in the  Chinese  Miscellanies published in in two small volumes My plan forbids me from entering further into the history let it  suffice to say that the Jesuits from the death of  Kamhi  experienced vicissitudes of fortune were either depressed or exalted according to the genius of his successors or according to the uses to which they were found subservient The dissolution of the order probably put an end to the Christian church in this political empire  For a statement of the present situation of the Missionaries c of the Christian religion in this empire the reader is referred to vol ii p et seq of Sir G Staunton's account of the embassy E    ANOTHER nation eminent for extending their religion far and wide could never effect by the power of the sword what this artful order did by insinuation and by temporizing with the customs and manners of the people of whom they intended to make their advantages The  Arabs  ARABS  who in other places inculcated the doctrine of their famed impostor by conquest and violence here never made the attempt long masters of the sea they came from the coasts of  Africa  or of  Arabia  and  India  in the form of traders in the tenth century The  Chinese  admitted them into their ports in that character but denied them permission to propagate their faith as they had done in  India  They were strictly forbidden to make any converts but were allowed the free exercise of their own religion as long as they did not interfere with that of the empire The  Portuguese  when they first arrived in  China  found the cities full of  Arabs  or  Moors  and Father  Navarette  a  Dominican  missionary in  China  in informs us that in his time there were about five hundred thousand which had greatly increased by intermarriages with the natives that many of them took their degrees among the  Chinese  literati  which evinces how the  Arabs  carried with them a thirst after knowledge but they were looked on by their brethren as apostates for mingling with a nation whose rites were so contrary to their own  NOTWITHSTANDING the  Mahometans  have been settled so many centuries in  China  they are in many places considered as intruders are treated most contemptuously by the vulgar and sometimes their mosques have been demolished by the mob  LET me now return to the temporal concerns of the  Chinese  empire  LAST REVOLUTION  The last revolution was effected in The emperor  TsongChing  reduced to despair by a successful rebellion put himself to death his brave general made head against the usurper but unfortunately like our  Vortigern  called in the assistance of a foreign power he invoked the  Manchew Tartars  who headed by their monarch  Tsongte  united with him and expelled the usurper  Tsongte  died as soon as that was effected but before his death declared his infant son emperor of  China  The general found his error too late yet submitted to the necessity and supported the new succession From that time the  Tartar  line continued on the throne but the prince and all the  Tartarian  subjects he brought with him adopted in the most minute articles the antient rules of the empire its laws and customs and assumed the habits of the conquered people  Tartars  and  Chinese  are admitted indifferently to places of trust civil and military The  Tartars  compose most of the garrisons but are now grown as effeminate as the  Chinese  themselves and very little superior to the native soldiery The army of  China  consists of  seven hundred thousand men dispersed in garrisons or along the great wall are well cloathed and armed and make a fine figure on a review or on a march  THE characteristic features of the  Chinese  in the males  FORM OF THE CHINESE  are a large forehead short nose well cut small eyes a large and square face great broad ears a middle sized mouth black hair and a large and fat body These constitute beauty in our sex The complexions in general are as fair as  Europeans  unless in the southern provinces or among the rank of people who are obliged to be exposed to the open air  THE noses of the females are short their eyes little their ears long their complexions ruddy their features regular and countenances gay their feet artificially small  LITTLE FEET  It has ever been the custom of the nurses to bind those parts so close as to prevent them from growing they esteem this a beauty notwithstanding it gives them a lameness in their gait yet they think the smallness of their feet a charm and shew them as much as possible  I SHALL now speak of the genius of this singular people  ARTS  and the progress they have made in the arts  I WILL begin with the medical  MEDICAL  All their  Materia Medica  answers to our  Galenical  medicines being drawn from simples they have a good knowledge of the uses of the vegetable kingdom They never meddle with the violent remedies gentle cathartics emollients strengtheners are the kinds they principally prescribe Green and bohea tea the  Ginseng  and other salutary roots are much in use They are totally ignorant of anatomy but pretend to great sagacity in the knowledge of the pulse they  not only judge of the species and nature of the disease but apply their remedy according to the symptoms it exhibits I refer to  Du Halde  Vol ii p  for the long but curious account of the practice They were well acquainted with the circulation of the blood long before the  Europeans  attained that knowlege As they know nothing of anatomy it must be by reasoning on the force and action of the pulse They bleed even with a bit of broken china  THEY had the knowlege of inoculation a great many years ago  INOCULATION  it is a disputed point whether the  Turks  from whom we learned the salutary art received it from the  Chinese  by means of the  Armenian  caravans or whether the same people might not have communicated it to the  Chinese  certain it is that they have long been in possession of the method and the emperor  Kamhi  made a noble use of it sending skilful persons into  Tartary  and other parts of his dominions to inoculate the children of his  Tartarian  subjects and others the distemper in every part of the empire being dreaded to the highest degree making the same havoc among these eastern people as the plague in the western world  THE art of printing was invented under the emperor  MingTsong  PRINTING  about the year of our Lord being above five hundred years before it was discovered in  Europe  They trace the types through the written copy on blocks of wood so never have occasion to break the press as we do in our quarter of the globe  THE manufacture of paper was originally discovered by  TsayJun  PAPER  a great Mandarine of the palace A D who made it nearly in the manner we do from old fragments of cloth or silk and the bark of trees boiled and reduced to a thin paste The consumption of paper in this empire is prodigious the  Cacoethes Scribendi  occasions an amazing demand and the quantity used for the papering of their rooms is inconceivable Their painted papers are more famed for the richness of the colors than the justness and elegance of the design They have no notion of perspective nor the least skill in delineating the human figure all which appear like so many caricatures The subjects are chiefly domestic scenes agriculture such as the cultivation of rice c c of tea and the various processes from the planting to the package for foreign markets  THE consumption of ink must necessarily be equal to that of paper the manufacture employs in the province of  Nanquin  INK  whole villages lampblack is the basis whether of the liquid ink used for printing or of that which is brought over to us under the name of  Indian  ink in sticks with  Chinese  characters and ornamented with colored figures of flowers c The invention of ink in  China  is said to have been in the reign of  Venti  about a hundred and sixty years before Christ  THE emperor  Kamhi  caused the wars against the  Elaths  and those on the frontiers of little  Bucharia  to be painted and sent long after into  Europe  in order to be engraven by the best artists these were the performances of the Jesuits and done in a very good manner They were placed in the hands of  Le Bas  at  Paris  and engraven in the plates were sent to  China  but because the figures in the back grounds were not drawn as large  as those in the fore the plates were returned to be altered which was done quite to the taste of the  Chinese  The mountain scenery is magnificent the actions or surprises cruel and sanguinary the fortified places and little wooden forts exactly represented with various specimens of the art military of these distant  Asiatics  I observed the  Bactrian  or two bunched camel much in use carrying swivel guns on their backs which were discharged at the fugitives climbing up the steeps of the mountains This work consists of sixteen very large prints finely engraven The copies in  Europe  are rare ten thousand pounds were allowed for the execution  THE use of artillery was not known among the  Chinese  till the arrival of the  Europeans  ARTILLERY  The first cannon they ever saw were three sent as a present to the emperor by the  Portuguese  of  Macao  in These were afterwards used against the  Tartars  who came in swarms to the great wall but terrified by the slaughter made among them by these novel machines of war they never approached it more  GUNPOWDER was invented in  Europe  by a monk  GUNPOWDER  the first cannon ever cast in  China  were the work of a Jesuit Father  Adam Schaal  by order of the emperor the next of the father  Verbiest  the great ornament of the order he first cast a hundred and thirty and after that three hundred and twenty They were tried in the presence of the emperor who so greatly approved the services of  Verhiest  that he loaded him with honors The Jesuits in return fixed on a day for blessing his labors dressed in his religious habit he nine times prostrated himself and beat his forehead against the ground He had previously  fixed a crucifix on an altar before the train of artillery which he baptized piece by piece and gave to each the name of a male or female saint taken from the calendar of his own church  GUNPOWDER was of very early invention in  China  and in  India  but till the time that I have just mentioned it was never applied to any other uses than fireworks on festive occasions in which the  Chinese  still excel all the rest of the world I refer the reader to p of the preceding volume for what I have said on the subject of the powder and artillery of the Orientalists  Voltaire  asserts that the  Chinese  had a manufactory of glass above two thousand years ago  GLASS  Du Halde  says that looking glasses are not among their articles of furniture They have indeed at  Yenching  in the province of  Shangtung  a manufactory but so brittle is their  Lewli  or glass as to break when exposed to too cold an air I am farther confirmed by my worthy friend  Thomas Fitzhugh  Esquire long resident in  China  that the art of making glass in  China  was in a very imperfect state as he informs me that about sixty or seventy years they were supplied with that article from  England  which would not have been the case had they excelled at home The glass was carried over in pieces in the shape of bricks from which trade it may be supposed the  Chinese  either did not then make it or that they found it more expensive in the process than purchasing the articles from foreigners  The manufacture of glass if a mere repetition of the fusion of broken pieces or of cakes brought from  Europe  deserves the name is confined to  Canton  and unknown in the rest of the empire E Embassy to  China  Vol ii p    THE works in japan or varnish  JAPANNING  are very considerable in this empire but do not equal those made in  Japan  itself The best is that of  Tonking  and  Nanking  the varnish is produced from the  Rhusvernix  which the  Chinese  call  Tsi  It is the same with that I have described at p of this volume The process in collecting it is the same and the workmen are affected with the same diseases in the operation I therefore will not repeat what I have before mentioned  THE very important article of silk shall next be spoken of  SILK  In my account of  Spain  will be given the history of the origin of this manufacture and the various countries it passed through in its way from  China  its native seat The care of the silkworm was of the most early date it was begun by  Siling  one of the queens of  Whangti  third emperor from  Fohi  at the period in which his subjects still clothed themselves in the undressed skins of wild beasts how surprising was the change for the luxurious habit of silk Succeeding empresses followed her example they went attended by their fair suite to the orchard of mulberry trees gathered the leaves of three trees either with their own hands or by the hands of the ladies under their inspection A piece of the finest silk was woven and devoted to the ceremony of the sacrifice to the  ShangTi  or the Supreme Being More policy than religion is intermixed with this sacrifice the wise  Chinese  knew that they could not inforce too strongly the cultivation of a tree which feeds the great staple of the empire  The  Chinese  have two trees which contribute to this purpose  MULBERRY TREES  the one is the  Sang  or  Tesang  the  Morus Alba  or white mulberry tree so well known in the south of  Europe  this is cultivated  in plantations The other kind is the  Che  or  Yesang  the wild mulberry which grows on the hills in forests has small roundish rough leaves scalloped on the edges and terminating in a point the branches thorny the fruit like pepper in a few words a tree of a distinct species if not genus from the former On these trees the young of the silkworms which are hatched are laid The silk produced from them is said to be stronger and earlier than from those bred on the common mulberry Paths are cut among the forests of the  Che  the ground is cleared of weeds which may give shelter to serpents that devour the worms and persons watch with guns to destroy the birds that make them their food these trees are also cultivated in some places like the white mulberry  I SHALL make mention of a species of silk totally different in its origin from the preceding this is described by  Du Halde  Vol i    SILK OF PLINY  who says it is made by certain worms in the province of  Shangtong  It is not fabricated by them into  Cocons  but left adhering to small trees or shrubs in form of very long threads which are gathered and woven into a coarse silk called  Kien chew  a very thick lasting sort which washes well and is in much esteem with the  Chinese  THIS account certainly vindicates the opinion held by the ancients that silk was an article combed from the leaves of certain trees  "Primi sunt hominum"  says  Pliny  speaking of the  Scytharum Gen  lib vi c xvii  qui noscantur Seres lanicio sylvarum nobiles perfusam aqua depectentes frondium canitiem  Virgil  delivers the same notion  Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia  Seres  The Romans believed it to be the same kind which was produced at  Rome  from the silkthread which had found its way there in the time of  Pliny  which makes him complain of the great trouble the  Roman  women had in winding and weaving their silk whilst the  Seres  had no more to do than to gather it from the leaves of trees  Unde geminus foeminis nostris labor redordiendi fila rursusque texendi  It was long before the manufacture of silks was established at  Rome  The use was discouraged by a law forbidding men to debase themselves by the wearing of silk as fit only for women The effeminate  Heliogabalus  is the first on record who wore a dress entirely of silk The manufactory even in the ribband or haberdashery way did not reach our kingdom till about the year  Spain  had very long the start of us Our monarchs were forced to be content with cloth stockings  Henry  VIII accidentally got a pair now and then from  Spain  Sir  Thomas Gresham  presented a pair to  Edward  VI which was much talked of Mrs  Montague  silkwoman to queen  Elizabeth  presented her with a pair of black silk after which her highness would never wear any of cloth Broad silks were not woven in  England  till the year The southern and western parts of  Europe  for centuries possessed that species of manufacture  THE manufacture of cotton must have been of great antiquity  COTTON  Du Halde  Vol i p  mentions the shrub and the time of the sowing which immediately follows the harvest and in the same field The produce is woven into calicoes and into a cloth well known in  England  by the name of  Nanquins  so called from the place  of manufacture I imagine that the  Chinese  have not at present sufficient quantity of raw materials as great quantities are said of late to have been imported from  India  OF the woollen manufactures I can say very little  WOOLLENS  In the province of  Shensi  the sheep and goats are sheered thrice a year and of the wool of the one and the hair of the other mixed is made a stuff much in request The sheep are the great tailed kind  THE Porcelain is of unknown antiquity  PORCELAIN  The Jesuit  D'Entrecolles  who had a church in a town in the province of  Kingteching  a first rate city which contained upwards of a million of people could not trace the origin That reverend father has been indefatigable in his enquiry and has produced a most elaborate account of the materials and process  THE first knowledge which the  Europeans  had of  China  was by the means of the  Seres  SERES  inhabitants of the northern parts of the empire These very distant people were among the nations whom the fame of  Augustus  had reached and who complimented him with an embassy which took four years journey to perform They presented the emperor with pearls pretious stones and elephants Silk is not mentioned yet probably  Virgil  learned from them that it was the production of their country as I remark from the line of his at p  Horace  informs us how expert the  Seres  were in the use of the bow  Puer quis ex aula capillis  Ad cyathum statuetur unctis  Doctus sagittas tendere Sericas  Arcu paterno  THE capital of these people is called by  Ptolemy Sera Metropolis  and placed by him in Lat ° ′ which so nearly agrees with the latitude of  Kingchew  in the province of  Pecheli  as to leave no doubt of that having been the site I have at p of the first volume of this work mentioned the  Comedae  and the station of those who were bound for the commerce with the  Seres  A branch of the  Imaus  runs from thence to the northeast and after some space to the east Part of the country to the southeast of this chain is the  Scythia intra Imaum  and the part to the northeast is the  Serica Regio  or land of the  Seres  Various towns or cities of little use to note are mentioned by  Ptolemy  In his time the resting places of the merchants in their road to the  Sera Metropolis  We know no more than that there was a commerce carried on with this country by caravans from the more western world that it was interrupted by the  Parthians  who had possessed themselves of most of the country from the  Caspian  sea to this branch of the  Imaus  and by that means the intercourse was entirely cut off  VERY long is the interval between that period and that in which we can find any travellers who had visited this distant country by land In the year  Nicolo Polo  and his brother  Maffio  illustrious  Venetians  set out on their commercial journey They took their departure from  Constantinople  for the splendid courts of the  Tartarian  princes who lived in great magnificence and gave the utmost encouragement to the  European  merchants and artists to come among them and improve them in the arts  William Ruysbroek  RUBRUQUIS  better known by the name of Friar  Rubruquis  made two journeys into great  Tartary  and mentions  Guillaume  L'Orfevre  and other artists who were employed in the service of  Mongukhan  To this day many rich proofs of the skill of  European  artists are discovered in tombs and other places The  Polos  remained nine years abroad and returning  Nicolo  found his wife dead he had left her pregnant the child survived and became the famous traveller so well known by the name of  Marco Polo  MARCO POLO  His father in accompanied his brother on another journey and took  Marco  then only eleven years of age with him They arrived at the court of  KublayKhan  commonly called by the  Chinese ShiTsu  fifth emperor of  Cathay  or northern  China  of the  Mogol  race a monarch of abilities and a great encourager of the arts He took a particular liking to young  Marco  who soon learned to read and write the four languages in use in the country he was in the service of the emperor seventeen years The royal residence during summer at that time was  Kambalu  or rather  Hampalu i e  the seat of the  Emperor  the same with the modern  Peking  but the capital of the empire was the present  Nanquin KublayKhan  made use of  Marco  on several important embassies and weighty affairs The father and brother continued with the court and in their commercial capacities contributed to its splendor by procuring jewels and all the materials of luxury  Marco  his father and uncle remained with the  Khan  a great number of years and returned safe to  Venice  in enriched by their profession and in the highest esteem with their countrymen  Marco  wrote his travels which have been published in most languages he was a diligent and faithful observer I must refer to  Bergeron  to  Purchas  but particularly to  John Reinhold  Forster  for the detail of his travels He gives a most splendid account of the court of his master and shews the state of the polite arts in  China  in those early days mentions the use of the silkworm the knowlege of the making of paper from the  Morus Papyrisera  the distillation of brandy from the milk of mares and numbers of other curious circumstances beyond the limits of my plan  Marco  was also attentive to the natural history of the country mentions coals which he calls black combustible stones describes some sorts of falcons and cranes the  Argus  pheasant or pheasants with tails thirty inches long and in particular speaks about the number of partridges and quails He takes notice of the  Musk  animal  Hist Quad  i N  o  The  Thibet  cows with long silky tails N  o  The  Argali  N  o  or wild sheep with enormous horns and several other matters both natural and oeconomical which have since been confirmed by more modern travellers  I SHALL now speak of the celebrated Sir  John Mandeville  SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE  Sir John was born at St  Albans  and became the greatest traveller of his or any other age having been out thirtyfour years and in the character of pilgrim knighterrant and man of observation visited the greatest part of  Africa  and  Asia  then known It is probable that he penetrated as far as  China  He left an account of his travels which were shamefully falsified by the monks who destroyed much of their credit by mingling with them legendary tales and stories out of  Pliny  but still truth appears so frequently that the authenticity of the ground work is by no means impaired He was called  Johannes de Mandevile  aliter dictus ad  Barbam  from his forked beard he found a grave at  Liege  in the convent of the Gulielmites in He is engraven on his tomb armed and treading on a lion At his head the hand of one blessing him and these words in the  French  of the time  Vos ki paseis sor mi pour l'amour Deix proies por mi  His knives horse furniture and spurs were in the time of  Ortelius  preserved at  Liege  by the monks and shewn to strangers  THE intercourse which the  Muscovites  had by their caravans with this part of the eastern world will be given in a future volume  RUSSIANS  I shall not therefore introduce it here but proceed to the first discovery of  China  by sea by the  Europeans  in the busy sixteenth century In the year  Alvarenga  PORTUGUESE  the  Portuguese  viceroy of the  Indies  turned his thoughts towards a settlement in  China  and bestowed on  Ferdinand Pedro Andrada  an able officer the conduct of the expedition In  June  he set sail from  Malacca  with three ships and arrived at the island of  Tamanlabua  four leagues from the main land of  China  At that time the coast was infested with pirates and fortunately  Andrada  fell in says  Osorio  Vol ii p  with the imperial fleet who on sight of him thinking him a pirate prepared for battle but how great was their surprize when they found that he gave no sign of hostile intention but sailed peaceably with them till they anchored off the isle of  Tama  I believe this to be the same which Mr  Nieuhoff  Voy p  calls  Heytamon  and possibly that on which  Macao  was built The  Chinese  admiral there sent to enquire who these strange people were and received such an answer as quite gained his confidence  Andrada  then sailed with them for the port of  Nanto  a fine city and harbor about sixty miles from  Canton  there he met with the most hospitable reception and by his prudent conduct quite conciliated the affection of the  Chinese  He landed there the embassador  Thomas Perez  who was immediately conducted to the imperial court  Andrada  returned to the isle of  Tama  informed himself of every thing that was necessary and greatly enriched himself and companions by his commerce with the merchants who flocked to him from different countries He left  China  after impressing on the nation the highest opinion of the integrity of his countrymen  ALL this was ruined by the ill conduct of  Simon  his brother who soon after arrived there to form the settlement After building a fort he thought himself secure and began to offer insults and violence of every kind to the natives who fell on the  Portuguese  killed numbers and obliged  Simon  to secure himself by flight  THE emperor dismissed the embassador who on his arrival at  Canton  was flung into prison by the citizens where he perished miserably  THE  Portuguese  for a long time were the detestation of the  Chinese  towards the close of the century they regained their affection by a piece of service they had an opportunity of doing to the empire by relieving it from the insult of the pirate  ChangsiLau  who had seized on the island of  Macao  and was besieging  Canton  The emperor presented the  Portuguese  with  Macao  as a reward who fortified it with two hundred pieces of cannon at which the subtle  Chinese  took no sort of umbrage for they had stationed their forces in such a manner as to cut them off  at will from even their daily provision The  Portuguese  still retain possession of the city and have a governor of their own but a Mandarine resides here who is supreme over the whole island so that they are in a very dependant state and they besides pay an annual tribute on the original agreement of being permitted to erect fortifications They enjoy their own laws and religion and have a bishop of  Macao  suffragan to the archbishop of  Goa  THE  English  came in late for their share of the  Chinese  trade  ENGLISH  In we made an unsuccessful attempt to get there but arrived no farther than the  Brazils  our thoughts at that period were full of the rich  Cathaian  coast and all  Europe  was engaged in many an attempt for the discovery of the passage to it but  Mountains of Ice did stop the imagin'd way  Beyond  Petsora  eastward to the rich  Cathaian  coast  OUR first factory in that empire was about the year  FIRST AT CHUSAN  when the  Chinese  granted to us  Chusan  a small island not far from the coast of  TcheTchiang  in Lat ° ′ It had been totally depopulated by the  Tartars  but began to be repeopled when we settled there The best account given of the place is by Mr  J Cunningham  a very ingenious surgeon who attended our colony he says  Ph Trans Abr vol v p  it abounded with provisions of all kind and with cows buffaloes deer goats and wild hogs and many kinds of esculent plants and with the tea shrub on the tops of the hills The  Kiewyeu Croton Sebiferum  Emb to China vol ii p E  or tallow tree is common  here and many other parts of  China  and grows as high as a tall cherry tree the fruit opens like a chesnut and contains kernels enveloped with a pulp which has all the properties of tallow excellent candles void of any smell are made of it when melted it also supplies the lamps with oil  Du Halde  Vol i p  gives us the process He also describes a tree called  Pelashu  which produces wax a kind of little worm fastens on its leaves wherewith being covered in a short time they form combs of wax much smaller than the honey combs this wax is very hard and shining and considerably dearer than beeswax When these worms are accustomed to the trees of any district they never quit them but on particular occasions if once they remove from a place they never return so that others must be procured in their stead there being merchants who deal in them  I cannot ascertain the  Genus  or species of this tree There is a  Myrica cerifera  in  North America  that affords a very good wax  Catesby  i tab and another at the  Cape of Good Hope Journal Historique  c p tab opposite to the page  Sparman  i p  Myrica Aethiopica Lin  Mr  Sparman  says that the berries are covered at a certain time of the year with a greenish waxlike and tallowy substance which he supposes to be the effect of insects of this the natives make candles I should think it the same with the species just described but that  Du Halde  says the insects in the  Chinese  plants deposit their wax on the leaves In the  Aethiopica  it is found on what  Linnaeus  calls cones  MR  Cunningham  also mentions the  Syringa Arabica  of  Gerard  p or the  Nyctanthes sambac  of  Linnaeus  NYCTANTHES SAMBAC  The  Flos Mamorae  of  Rumph  v tab xxx of general esteem among the Orientalists on account of the fine scent of the flowers  OUR factory at  Chusan  was not of long duration but was removed to  Canton  which by a decree of the emperor was directed to be the only port allotted for the  European  commerce We once had intercourse with the city of  Ninpo  but that is also prohibited  THE nature and extent of our present trade with  China  PRESENT TRADE OF CHINA  both

Catties= lb averdupois  Catty= Tales Catties= lb  Tale= Mace  Mace= Candareens E  THE  Dutch  made their first settlement for the benefit of the  Chinese  on the isle of  Formosa  DUTCH  and deceitfully under pretence of building a house erected a strong fort so as to command the entrance into the port they had sixed on it was said that they made use of the stale  Phoenician  stratagem of the ox's hide in the building of  Byrsa  or the famous  Carthage  The  Japanese  had not long before made a conquest of the island but were too weak to resent this perfidy The  Dutch  now were in possession of a flourishing trade with the two great empires of  China  and  Japan  It was lost to them in the year by the fault of the factions which reigned at  Batavia  the seat of the  Dutch  government in  India Iquon  a taylor who lived in the  Dutch  town on the island of  Formosa  a man of undaunted courage had revolted from the  Chinese  empire and became so powerful as to induce the Emperor to get him seized by persidy and poisoned  COXENGA  his son  Coxenga  inherited all his abilities At first he applied to the  Dutch  for succor but being refused turned his resentment against them He prepared a vast fleet and army landed near the  Dutch  settlement and notwithstanding every effort of the governor  Frederick Cojet  whose defence was gallant and obstinate at length compelled him to surrender by capitulation  Cojet  had been at first neglected by his countrymen who when it was too late sent a strong fleet from  Batavia  it met with a severe repulse and was compelled to leave their colony to its fate We shall hereafter meet the  European  nations at their common permissive settlement at  Canton  I shall quit the subject I have been on and change it to that of a particular topography of the coasts of the vast empire  To speak generally  BOUNDARIES OF CHINA  the country may be said to be divided  to the south from  Thibet  and  Boutan  by chains of most exalted mountains branches of the  Imaus  and  Hemodus  they penetrate even into various parts of  China  other mountains equally high separate the empire from western  Tartary  These vast Alpine chains are the defences of this mighty empire from invasions by land The great wall hereafter to be mentioned secures the parts unprotected by nature The coast is usually rude and rocky and the interior often rises into craggy picturesque mountains or is intersected by numerous rivers and canals The seas are shallow so that even from a naval attack the country has its protection  NOTWITHSTANDING part of  China  is within the tropics and the great remainder does not exceed Lat north yet the cold is during winter intense There is no country in which exists such a necessity for furs their own empire  Tartary  and  Siberia  is almost exhausted for the supply the  English  even furnish them with quantities from  North America  Ice has been seen at  Canton  an inch in thickness Between  Nimpo  and  Peking  the cold has been so severe in  January  and  February  that travellers have been forced to lie by till the ice could be broken on the river  Hoambo  the largest in  China  before they could pass over Mr  Kirwan  says that the greatest cold at  Peking  in Lat ° ′ is ° the greatest heat yet on  July  th the thermometer rose to and The extremest cold is produced by a northeast or northwest wind the last blows over the vast tract of  Tartary  and  Siberia  In  Peking  during winter the animals and fowls of all kinds are exposed to sale in the markets frozen and so preserved from putrefaction for weeks together  THE interior of  China  maintains a most singular character it is varied with chains of mountains winding along its surface yet so as to leave vallies that enabled one of the emperors to open a communication by water partly by means of rivers and partly by navigable canals from  Peking  to  Canton  a distance of miles little interruption occurs in this vast space except the lofty mountains which separate the provinces of  Kiangsee  and  QuanTung  We shall speak farther of this and the other canals in their proper places  I SHALL now enter on the topographical account  ISLAND OF HAINAN  commencing at its southern extremity The island of  Hainan i e  the south of the sea expresses its situation It belongs to the province of  Quangtung  which opposite to  Hainan  juts far south in a peninsulated form and is distant above twelve miles from the shore is a hundred and sixty leagues in circumference and produces every thing that can conduce to the wants and conveniences of life the climate alone is bad by reason of the quality of the water  GOLD  The island abounds with gold but as it has been but half conquered that valuable metal is in the power of the natives a brave independent people who live in the middle parts amidst arduous mountains the rest of the country being a plain The inhabitants had long a traffic with the  Chinese  one was deputed to examine the goods offered and on the other part a  Chinese  merchant went to see those of the mountaineers the utmost honor was observed on both sides The  Chinese  especially the governor made immense profit of the gold This the great  Kanghi  discovered and put a final stop to a commerce which till then had been allowed by law The  Lapis Armenus  which produces blue so much in request for coloring the porcelane  is also found here and much of it sent to  Canton  for that purpose The fisheries are very lucrative twenty or thirty thousand jonks of no inconsiderable size come annually from  Canton  to take in cargoes of the dried or salted fish Our company's ships now and then put in here and may be secure during the monsoons  THE continent after attaining the bottom of the peninsula trends towards the northeast and is all the way skirted with isles Those best known to mariners are the two  Sanciams  the  False  and that called  Saint John  's beneath which is good anchorage The great  Ladrone  and the  Asses Ears  are noted land marks The entrance of the vast bay of  Canton  opens to the east of  Sanciam  the breadth there is about two and twenty leagues and the depth nearly the same but filled with islands divided by most narrow and intricate channels possibly these might be the  gates  of  China  mentioned by the two  Mahometan  travellers of the ninth century as  Canton  was their  Canfu  even at that time a most flourishing city It was also the  Canectum  of the  Nubian  geographer  Page    Sanciam  is famed for having been the place of interment of  Saint Francis de Xavier  ISLE OF SANCIAM  and for his tomb which still is to be seen Another isle is that of  Hoanpou  where the  Dutch  had built a fort in order to command the navigation of the  Tigris  or river of  Canton  Their design was discovered and they were all massacred  THE most important city is that of  Macao  MACAO  seated on a little peninsula and which was during a certain period celebrated  for its wealth and commerce it is now quite declined from its former splendor but is well known to the  Europeans  as the place where their ships commonly anchor in their way inward and from being the residence of all the  European  factories who are obliged by the  Chinese  to quit  Canton  as soon as the ships have left the river  TYPA  About six miles lower is the  Typa  a harbor for careening of ships Here Commodore  Anson  heaved down the  Centurion  in  January  previous to the capture of the  Manilla  ship on  June  th old stile which established the great fortunes of that lucky house  THE  Humen  BOCCA TIGRIS  or  Tigersgate  or the  Boccatigris  of the  Portuguese  is the narrow pass into that river which is not a musketshot over and defended by two miserable batteries Mr  Anson  passed them in his way to the  Canton  river The poor pilot who reluctantly carried him through and the mandarine who commanded the forts were most severely punished for what they could not possibly help the commodore having threatened to hang the pilot in case of noncompliance The poor mandarine knew his own weakness The real mouth of the river is some miles below the  Bocca  and has on one side the  Lion  's tower or pagoda The river takes from thence a grand curvature towards the west The anchoring place for the  European  ships is under the isle of  Wampoo  a few miles to the east of  Canton  The approach into the bay and the amazing view along the river is so graphically described by my favorite M  Le Poivre  that I cannot resist using the words of that enchanting author  On the appearance of land says he I perceived along the horizon a forest of masts and soon  after an innumerable multitude of boats which covered the surface of the water these were thousands of fishermen whose industry drew from the deeps subsistence for numbers The land now began to rise to my view I advanced to the mouth of the river still amidst crowds of fishers throwing out their lines on every side I entered the river of  Kanton  it is people like the land its banks lined with ships at anchor a prodigious number of small craft are continually gliding along in every direction some with sails others with oars vanishing often suddenly from the sight as they enter the numberless canals dug with amazing labour across extensive plains which they water and fertilize Immense fields covered with all the glory of the harvest with stately villages rising to the eye on every side adorn the remoter view whilst mountains covered with verdure cut into terraces and shaped into amphitheatres form the back ground of this noble landscape  THE  Chinese  divide their cities into first rate second and third  CANTON  The first may be known by the addition of  foo  the second by that of  tchoo  the third by that of  hyen Quangtchoofoo  or  Canton  is chief among the first as it is supposed to contain a million of inhabitants  Fachan  a village a few miles higher has the same number This in some measure inclines us to think that  Voltaire  's calculation is not very far out of the way  VERY POPULOUS  The land and the very water is inhabited Millions live in the  Sampanes  or vessels placed on each side of the great rivers Those of  Canton  alone may contain two hundred and twentyfive thousand inmates Thousands and thousands dwell on the  exalted rocks some are excavated into mansions and every ledge has on its its elegant cottage swarms of people inhabit the edges of precipices as the myriads of birds do the great promontories of  Britain  Paths are cut through the rocks to render them accessible and over some are conducted even public roads I have seen several of these populated rocks most accurately represented in rice with all the oeconomy of their inhabitants expressed  THE city is divided into three the  Tartarian  the  Chinese  and a third beyond the first which is represented on the plan as a void space The streets are narrow but well paved and cross each other at right angles The whole is surrounded with a wall and each city separated from the other by another wall The gates of  Canton  are shut in the evening as are the barriers at the end of every street so that the greatest cities are as quiet as a private family  TRIUMPHAL arches are very frequent in most of the cities  TRIUMPHAL ARCHES  the ancient are the most elegant adorned with beautiful figures of men birds and flowers in altrelief quite standing from the stone and connected only by cordons left for the purpose These monuments are probably honorary memorials of the great actions of individuals  IN front on each side of the city and on the opposite shore of the river  EUROPEAN FACTORIES  are large suburbs The factories of the  European  merchants consist of a long row of houses ranged on the river side and a space of land behind about two hundred yards broad each has a warehouse for its goods The mercantile nations are the  English French Imperialists Dutch Swedes  and  Danes  Each factory has the flag of its country  erected before it on a tall pole This is the only port in the whole empire allowed to the  Europeans  Their ships may take in wood and water where they please but are every where else strictly forbid to trade even here they are a sort of prisoners they are not to go beyond their bounds they may indeed enter the suburbs but are sure to meet with every species of abuse from the mob They are allowed to reside only during the time the ships remain at  Wampu  for as soon as they sail for  Europe  every factory is obliged to retire to  Macao  till the season of their return  THE proper name of the river of  Canton  is  TaHo  RIVER OF CANTON  or the great river The stream is rapid but affected by the tide which rises four or five feet opposite to the city it is navigable for numbers of miles into the interior parts of the country for large vessels from the sea even to the city of  Quangsi  and again its advantages are spread far and wide by the infinity of canals Not only this and other cities but the canals themselves for miles together have their quays made of cut stone of stupendous size forming the most magnificent sight which art applied to commercial purposes can exhibit  THE river of  Canton  is guarded by various fortifications The square castle on the island engraven by Mr  Nieuhoff  is a specimen of that kind of defence  THE multitudes of ducks which animate the river about  Canton  is amazing  TAME DUCKS  "they are hatched" says Mr  Latham  Ornith Vol iii  by artificial heat the eggs being laid in boxes of sand are placed on a brick hearth to which is given a proper heat during the  required time for hatching The ducklings are fed with little crawfishes and crabs boiled and cut small and afterwards mixed with boiled rice and in about a fortnight shift for themselves when the  Chinese  provide them an old stepmother who leads them where they are to find provender for themselves being first put on board a  Sampane  or boat which is destined for their habitation and from which the whole flock often to the amount of three or four hundred go out to feed and return at command This method is used nine months out of the twelve for in the colder months it does not succeed and is so far from a novelty that it may be every where seen but more especially about the time of cutting the rice and gleaning the crop when the masters of the duck  Sampanes  row up and down the river according to the opportunity of procuring food which is found in plenty at the tide of ebb on the rice plantations as they are overflowed at high water It is curious to see how the ducks obey their master for some thousands belonging to different boats will feed at large on the same spot and on a signal given will follow their leader to their respective  Sampanes  without a stranger being found among them This is still more extraordinary if we consider the number of inhabited  Sampanes  on the  Tigris  supposed to be no less than forty thousand which are moored in rows close to each other with a narrow passage at intervals for boats to pass up and down the river The  Tigris  at  Canton  is somewhat wider than the  Thames  at  London  and the whole river is there covered in this manner for the extent of at least a mile  THE manner of taking the wild ducks in this country is singular  WILD DUCKS HOW TAKEN  The performers put their heads into the shells of large gourds with holes made in them to see and breathe through then going naked into the water they walk or swim so low that nothing appears but the gourds The ducks being accustomed to see gourds floating on the surface and to play about them approach without fear when the duckhunter taking them by the feet pulls them under water to prevent their making a noise wrings their necks and fastens them to his girdle pursuing his exercise till he has procured a great number  I MAY mention here that most elegant of ducks  CHINESE TEAL  the  Chinese Teal  Latham Ornith Vol iii  but words are almost wanting to express the beauty of the coloring and the specific oddity of the fine feathers of the wings erecting themselves in a curved manner when the wings are closed Mr  Edwards  's representation  Tab  may serve to give the idea These are a scarce species and kept for sale at  Canton  and sold at the rate of six or even ten dollars the pair  No country abounds with fishes equal to  China  FISHES  yet we have been very unfortunate by the inattention paid to that branch of its natural history  Osbeck  and  Sparman  both boasted disciples of  Linnaeus  have given us but a very meagre catalogue From these and a few other sources I shall give all that I can collect let me observe that the most numerous  genera  of fresh water are the carp and the perch  Du Halde  mentions some curious species of fishes but his descriptions want the perspicuity of a naturalist so are unintelligible  Du Halde  ii p gives us two very curious methods of  fishing  COVORANTS TRAINED FOR FISHING  one is by means of a species of Corvorant trained for the purpose By the figure given by Mr  Nieuhoff  p it seems the very same to our common kind  This Corvorant proves to be a distinct species distinguished by the name of  Pelicanus Sinensis  and is figured in the th plate of Sir G Staunton's Account of the Embassy to  China  the mode of conveying these birds from place to place is delineated in Vol ii p of that entertaining and interesting work E  The  Chinese  call it  Louwa  In Mr  Willughby  's ornithology p we find that this species of fisheries was in old times frequently practised in  England  Mr  Latham  vi informs us that a kind of diver is used also for the same purpose "In the morning" says  Du Halde  i  when the sun rises one may see on the rivers a considerable number of boats and several of these birds sitting at the head of them Then the fishermen turning their boats about at the signal given by striking the water with an oar the cormorants fly into the river one here another there and diving to the bottom seize the fish they light on by the middle then rising up again they carry it to the bark where the fisherman receiving it takes the bird and holding its head downwards passes his hand along the neck to make it disgorge the small fish that it had swallowed but is hindred from going into the gullet by a ring put on the lower part of the neck which after the fishing is quite over they take off and give them something to eat When the fish happens to be too large for one bird they mutually assist each other one takes the tail another the head and bring it to the boat to their master  THE other way of taking fish is very simple and gives but little trouble for this purpose they make use of long narrow  boats nailing on each side from one end to the other a plank two feet broad This plank is japanned with white shining varnish and slants gently till it almost touches the top of the water in the night time when it is used they turn it towards the moon that the reflection may increase its splendor so that the fish which are sporting easily mistaking the color of the japanned plank for that of the water leap often on that side and fall either on the plank or into the boat  IN respect to quadrupeds  QUADRUPEDS  this empire retains many of those of  India  but loses also several towards the northern and western parts others appear suited to the climate these are pointed out in the  Faunula  which I reserve as a sort of appendix unwilling to interrupt the narrative part of this work  AT  Canton  begins the celebrated passage by water from hence to  Peking  WATER PASSAGE TO PEKING  and the extremity of the great empire of  China  an extent says  Du Halde  Vol ii  of six hundred leagues or about eighteen hundred  English  miles The emperor  Shitsu  finding the defect of tribute he annually sustained or the vast loss of his subjects in the articles of commerce which perished at sea in the conveyance from the maritime parts of his dominions determined on creating an internal navigation  IMPERIAL CANAL  He began the work in it is probable that he did not complete so stupendous an undertaking and it is imagined it was not finished till the time of  YongJo  who began his reign about thirtyfive years after We may well admit this as the length of the imperial canal is nine hundred miles the depth a fathom and a half and it conveys annually near ten thousand large barks belonging to  the Emperor besides others innumerable the property of merchants or of private people who hire them to travellers They are all richly ornamented especially the imperial which carry on them the dragon of five claws the arms of the empire The traveller if he takes the route of  Quangsi  and  Huquang  is under no necessity of ever quitting his bark from  Canton  to  Peking  he meets with rivers and lakes till he falls in again with the  YuHo  or  Royal Canal  as it is named by way of preeminence On that canal the voyager is only obliged to quit his vessel once in nine hundred miles the mountain  Meylin  intervenes and makes it necessary for him to take a day's journey before he can again benefit of the royal work The shipping on the canal and rivers are often so numerous as to fill the channel for a mile or two and quite obstruct for a time their progress  GREAT fairs are also kept on the rivers  GREAT FAIR ON THE WATER  "One season" says  Hamilton  at one place and in other seasons at other places and though there may be vessels assembled at a fair yet there is as good order and decorum kept as in a wellgoverned city All ships and boats who have the same species of goods are moored together along a certain place on the river side allotted for them by proper magistrates and at night watches are sent to prevent thieving and disorder and offenders are severely punished without respect of persons  John Nieuhoff  J NIEUHOFF  the celebrated traveller of the last century is the only one  Sir George Staunton's Account of the spirited and wellconducted Embassy to  China  was not published at the time this work was composed E  who gives an account of the entire inland voyage from the south to almost the very north of the mighty empire  That able writer was born on  July  d at  Uffen  in the earldom of  Bentham  of a respectable family his person was elegant his understanding good his temper and conversation amiable he was fond of the fine arts poetry music and drawing and master of several languages In the year he entered into the  Dutch West India  service and made his first voyage to the  Brazils  where he resided nine years He has left us an admirable description of the country and of the many great events of that period which happened between his countrymen and the  Portuguese  HIS next voyage was to the  East Indies  in the year He visited the coast of  Malabar  the peninsula of  Malacca  and many of the islands even to the  Moluccas  His accounts are the most satisfactory of any extant his attention to several branches of natural history was very considerable and he has given various plates of the fishes of the  Indies  done with much accuracy considering the infant state of the science On this voyage he was eight years absent from home His last voyage designed also for the  East Indies  was begun on  January  st He landed at  Madagascar  in order to trade with the natives and as is supposed was with his people massacred by the inhabitants in the month of  September  of the same year for he never more was heard of Diligent enquiry was made after him by the surviving part of the crew left on board his ship and afterwards a yatch was dispatched from the  Cape of Good Hope  to repeat the search which proved equally fruitless  HIS brother  Henry Nieuhoff  H NIEUHOFF  collected together all the papers he left behind and published them to the great honor of his  memory They were written and printed originally in  Dutch Churchill  has given us his voyage to the  Brazils  and to the  East Indies  in the second volume of his collection The learned  Hornius  has translated into  Latin  the famous journey from  Canton  to  Peking  This is so curious and novel that I shall attend the able traveller in his route and briefly notice the most remarkable things  HIS TRAVELS TO PEKING  An embassy was determined on by the  Dutch  to the coast of  Peking  to the great emperor  Kanghi Nieuhoff  was fortunately appointed secretary His account is a firstrate performance and the more pleasing as it is attended with views of the country cities and buildings engraven from drawings done by his skilful pencil  THE embassadors had every possible respect paid to them they embarked at  Canton  on board a magnificent jonk on  March  th amidst the acclamations of the people and a general discharge of the artillery The  Chinese  sent  avantcouriers  from place to place to make provisions for their reception even till their arrival at  Peking  THEY began with ascending the river  Peikyangho  all their route was marked with beautiful scenery and various towns and cities most of them surrounded with embattled walls and strengthened by square towers Many of the landscapes are most picturesque We are struck with the river flowing by the vast mountain  Sangwonhab  overhanging on both sides and on one a great frequented road  STRANGE ROAD  cut out of the solid rock impending over the water At the foot is a pagoda the nightly haunt say the natives of daemons  FARTHER on  CITY XAOCHEW  not remote from the city  Xaochew  or  Tchautchoofoo  a vast mountain seems to open its sides to make room for the famed pagoda  KonjanSjam  filled with horrid idols to whom almost constant sacrifices are offered by the fanatical visitants  A LITTLE farther is the great castle  Mongley  of a quadrangular form with a square tower at each corner equal in size within to a town seated on a losty eminence and accessible by a numerous flight of steps cut out of the live rock  THE city  Xaochew  next appears near the conflux of two rapid rivers infamous for frequent wrecks A pagoda is erected on the banks famed for its idol to which mariners send up their prayers for a safe passage as the  Romans  did of old and as the Christians of many parts of  Europe  do to their Saint  Elmo  to this very day  THE rocks called the  Five horses heads  FIVE HORSES HEADS  and the still more curious rocks named  Suytjeen  or the  five horrible devils  near to the ferry  Suytjeen  as much dreaded as  Scylla  and  Charybdis  for the frequent shipwrecks near them They are of a columnar form and appear as if placed in order by human art  Nanhang  or  Nansheunfoo  in Lat ° ′ ″  CITY NANHANG  is the last in the province of  Quangtung  and a considerable trading city to the north of it is a famous road over the mountain  Meylin  cut through the rock three miles in length with precipices on both sides but of a secure wideness This singular road being a great communication from north to south is perpetually crowded as much as the streets of the most populous cities on the summit is built a temple in honor of the mandarine who made this useful way at his own expence  AFTER travelling some days on horseback  NANGAN  Mr  Nieuhoff  reached the great city  Nangan  in the province of  Kyangsee  seated on  the river  Kanhyang  in Lat ° ′ ″ This river runs through the middle of the province and divides it into two equal parts The  Chinese  call it  Kankiang  THE KYANG RIVER  or son of the sea and added that "the sea is without shore and the  Kyang  without bottom" this fiction arises from the fishermen never using any sounding lines above sixty fathoms long but even that depth is a vast one for a river By means of the numerous canals that branch from it the city has vast commerce and was once celebrated for its porcelain of a snowy whiteness The province is rich in mines of gold silver iron lead and tin The silks are very beautiful and the rice and wine made from it is in high esteem in all parts of the empire  THE lakes of this province are in the season covered with the beautiful blossoms of the  Nymphaea Lotus  and  Nelumbo  NYMPHAEA NELUMBO  no flowers are in such request with the  Chinese  as these The great men have them transplanted into their little ponds filled for the purpose with mud and water in their courts The physicians esteem the fruit as highly restorative after long sickness and the root of the  Nelumbo  is a common food either eaten raw or made into meal so that these plants are of the first use in this empire  Vannunga  VANNUNGA  on the river  Kan  was a city of great size and splendor now a heap of ruins from an inroad of the  Tartars  a melancholy sight to the numerous passengers who sail under its walls  PEKKINSA  Pekkinsa  is the next city a most flourishing place which supplies the mariners with all kind of necessaries for their vessels  NOT far from thence are various specimens of several lofty rocky hills  PIERCED HILLS  cut or pierced through by human art into grotesque  forms merely to please the eye Those engraven by Mr  Nieuhoff  P  are pierced through in various places others have great flights of steps cut out of the live rock either to the summit or half way up round which a walk is conducted guarded by rails and forming a gallery beneath the impending remainder of the mountain  Nangtchangfoo  is a city seated in Lat ° ′  NANTCHANGFOO  near the lake  Poyang  which is about four leagues broad and thirty in length  LAKE POYANG  abounding with excellent fish among which are many  European  such as sturgeon salmon carp chubs trout shads and lampries  ABOUT thirty miles farther to the north of  Nantchang  the waters of the lake unite with those of the great river  Kyang  which is continued from thence to the sea  HOOTCHOO  The city  Hootchoo  stands on the eastern bank of the junction A few miles up the river to the west is the city  Kyew Kiang  the rendezvous of the barks of many parts of the empire The river runs gently from hence to the sea with a course almost imperceptible but is at full and new moon affected by the tide  IN the  Kyang  near that city where the river is a league broad  THE FISH WHANGYU  is found the  Whangyu  or yellow fish that often weighs eight hundred pounds it is remarkably firm and most excellent eating these fish are taken in certain seasons when they come out of the lake  Poyang  into the river We cannot ascertain the species  Du Halde  Vol i p  speaks of another he calls the  Chokyaryw  or armour fish  ARMOUR FISH  being covered with strong scales placed like tiles in the roof of a house I suspect it to be the  esox osseus  of  Linnoeus  or the  acus maxima squammosa  of  Willughby Hist pisc  app tab p viii This grows to forty pounds weight and is in high esteem  ABOUT fifty miles from the eastern side of the  Poyang  lake  KINGTECHING  in Lat ° ′ stands  Kingteching  on a plain surrounded with mountains and having a navigable communication with the lake by means of a river that passes by the city  Yauchew  and is crowded with vessels which are continually passing or repassing either with the materials for the famous porcelain ware or with the porcelain itself which is manufactured in no other place in the empire than at  Kingteching  IN the Itinerary of Mr  Nieuhoff  TONGLYU UFUN  Tonglyu Ufun Anhing  and  Teytong  appear most delightfully seated on the river  Tonglyu  bears numerous marks of the ravages of the  Tartars  at  Ufun  is a manufacture of arms famous throughout all the empire  THE great city of  Nanking  or  Nanquin  NANQUIN  in Lat ° ′ ″ is seated on an extensive plain near a league from the river but united to it by several canals capable of bringing up the imperial barks which are as large as middle sized ships This city was once the capital of  China  till it was removed to  Peking  It was the  Chambdan  of the  Nubian  geographer on a river of the same name which he says  P  was the largest in  China  The  Tartars  made themselves masters of this city in and before they deserted it burnt the magnificent imperial palace demolished the famous observatory and violated and destroyed the sepulchres of the emperors and other distinguished personages The city is reported to be ninety miles in circumference later  surveys have made it only eighteen but it certainly had been of far greater extent much is now a waste and retains all the marks of the  Tartarian  fury but enough is inhabited to make it a most populous and flourishing city Of the parts which escaped the rage of the  Tartarian  ravages is the  Porcelain tower  PORCELAIN TOWER  a pagoda of nine stages of most exquisite workmanship and lined with beautiful tiles of  Porcelain  from which it derives its name It is far the most beautiful in  China  Mr  Nieuhoff  gives a fine view of this curious structure as he does of one of the modern streets the signs and manner of building the walls of the city some of the gates and idol temples evince its former grandeur it is besides the seat of the literati and consequently abounds with fine libraries and is eminent for its booksellers shops paper ink and all that can feed the  Cacoethes scribendi  It is not without other manufactures its fattins are in high request as are the woollen cloths fabricated here  Nanquin  is garrisoned partly by  Chinese  partly by  Tartars  the last commanded by one of their country they possess one part of the city and are separated from the other inhabitants by a single wall  ABOUT the year the famous  Corsair Coxinga  came up the river with three thousand sail of ships and laid siege to the place It happened that on his birth day his army past the day with carousals and all sorts of festivity The garrison guessing that they should find the enemy buried in sleep sallied out surprised the camp slew multitudes and forced the rest to find security in their ships  Coxinga  afterwards fought and defeated the  Tartarian  fleet and by his cruelty in cutting off the noses of four thousand prisoners sullied his victory  THE passage over the  Kyang  from  Nanquin  was in the time of  Nieuhoff  on a bridge composed of fourteen pontoons The pretty town of  Jejenjeen  is on the opposite side  YANGCHOO  He entered soon after on the imperial canal and passed by  Yangchoo  a great and populous city in Lat ° ′ flourishing by its being the staple of the salt trade that useful article made on the seashores is brought here by the lesser canals and by the same means transported to most parts of the empire for they extend in many directions westward even to the borders of  Tartary  The canal is continued northward on the side of the great lake  Kaoyeouhoo  SINGULAR VESSELS  the same which Mr  Nieuhoff  calls  Piexe  Here the forms of the vessels are very singular they are called  Longschon  or serpentine and are used to carry fish quite to  Peking  These are represented in form of a serpent from the prow issues the head on which is placed an idol with some live ducks pendent from the stern is suspended a boy who is playing all sorts of monkey tricks The masts are decorated with numbers of flags and serpents appear cut or painted in every part It is manned with rowers who with their broad oars not unlike paddles go with most astonishing celerity It is incredible with what expedition fish are conveyed fresh to  Peking  even from distances of six hundred miles  THE city of  Yangchoo  is infamous for its traffic in women  TRADE IN WOMEN  It produces the most beautiful in all  China  particularly for the admirable smallness of their feet and the symmetry of their bodies They are trained from their childhood in every accomplishment singing dancing painting and composing of verses but above all in the practice of every lascivious attraction These  unfortunate women form a vast article of commerce and the merchant panders dispose of them to every part of the empire  THE next city of note is  Kajutsiu  KAJUTSIU  then follows  Hoinganfoo  seated on the river  Hoai  near which are vast embankments to keep off the fury of the sea all this neighborhood is marshy yet extremely productive of rice The whole country may have been gained from the watery element yet it must have been many ages past for a field near  Hoingan  is distinguished by the numbers of ancient  tumuli  Many of the towns appear like  Venice  built in the water and some even below  Whaynganfoo  in Lat ° ′ is one  WHAYNGAN  it is built below the level of the great canal which is near that city supported by strong dykes Here very properly one of those mandarines resides who has the charge of the canal and is called grand master of the waters Not far from the west of it is the vast lake  Hongtsehoo  which just below the city is discharged into the great river  Whangho  or the  Yellow River  which rises in Lat  RIVER WHANGHO  ° north amidst the mountains of the  Tartars  of  Kokonor  near the edge of the great desert  Shamo  or  Gobi  Its course is about six hundred leagues and the current so violent that it is impossible for a ship to sail up the stream it is liable to great inundations insomuch that the inhabitants of the low province of  Honan  are obliged to surround their cities at a small distance from their walls with a strong mound Mr  Nieuhoff  exemplified this in his plate  At p  The waters are of a yellow color tinged with the strata they pass through which is the origin of the name This  river in the neighborhood of  Whayngan  notwithstanding its low latitude ° ′ its great breadth in that part of more than an  English  half mile and its violent rapidity is at times entirely frozen  THE route to  Peking  is continued through two other provinces  Shantung  and  Petchelee  The rich populous and commercial city  Tongchang  is in Lat ° ′ This city has also its porcelain tower being even externally made with that material and with little bells pendant at each angle of its eight towers which moved by the wind yield a pretty modulation  KyoFew Hyen  is a city renowned for having been the birth place of the great  Confucius  CONFUCIUS WHERE BORN  so justly celebrated throughout the empire of  China  MR  XANTSUI  Nieuhoff  mentions several other places in this province such as  Xantsui  with the  Teywanmiao  its remarkable pagoda not distinguished for its grandeur  FINE PAGODA  but for the great beauty of the workmanship It is rather low and square of a vast size and inclosed within a most extensive wall made of stone and the upper part of red and green tiles The temple itself is of stones mixed with yellow tiles the imperial color so resplendent as to appear like gold when shone upon by the sun it is besides richly decorated with dragons and various  Chinese Chimerae  the inside filled with monstrous idols On the back part is a garden delightful as that of paradise enriched with variety of fruits and flowers  Jax Hinno  is a town distinguished by the multitude of square towers which rise in all parts  JAX HINNO  like our tower steeples whether they are for defence or belonging to pagodas does not appear  Lintsinchoo  is a city in Lat ° ′  LINTSINCHOO  distinguished by the multitude of vessels continually there in their passage to the capital or different parts of the empire as the great river  Euteo  unites here with the imperial canal There is also a customhouse which brings in a vast revenue Without the walls is a very splendid pagoda of nine stories the outside is of the very fine earth with which porcelain is made and richly painted  Tetchoo  the last city in the province of  Shantung  TETCHOO  is seated on the river in Lat ° ′ From hence we immediately enter into the province of  Petchelee  the most northern in  China  The navigation is continued to  Tongchoosoo  within a small distance of  Peking  the latter part on the river  Peiho  which flows from the northern capital of  China  into the gulph of  Petchelee  ON the mountains near  Sinkosien  grow the eaglewood trees and the  Calamba  EAGLE WOOD  both form great articles of commerce and are sold even in  China  at a large price but at still greater in  Hindoostan  where so much is consumed by the Gentoos for burning their dead Near this city is a most beautiful octagonal pagoda consisting indeed but of three stages but admirable for the roofs of most exquisite workmanship  Single  and  Tiensingfoo  are the next cities  SINGLE AND TIENSINGFOO  The last is seated Lat ° ′ on the conflux of three great rivers On an island formed at that spot is a most singular castle of a triangular form truncated at the top this is the greatest emporium in all  China  and strongly fortified in the manner of the country the resort of jonks and all sorts of shipping are incredible it being a port free from tribute The city is not large but the suburbs so extensive as to make it one of the most populous in the empire  and are filled with palaces and pagodas  Nieuhoff  imagines this city to have been the  Quinsay  of  Marco Polo  Bergeron's Coll p  which he says "was like  Venice  built on a morass" The emperor he informs us had a magnificent palace here and adds that no less than six hundred thousand families were to be found in this vast place What is singular the  Neslorians  had a church in the city a proof that Christianity was tolerated in this empire in the thirteenth century  NEAR  Joerwoe  Mr  JOERWOE  Nieuhoff  went along another canal made in the river  Chaolcang  he passed by  Focheen Sansianswey  and  Tongtchoofoo  TONGTCHOOFOO  At the distance of four miles from  Peking  the navigation ends The reason assigned for its not being brought to the walls of the city is that multitudes of the poor entirely subsist by the carriage of goods and the necessaries of life into the capital At this place the  Dutch  embassadors were met by a magnificent cavalcade of mandarines and people of rank sent by the emperor to do them honor and they entered the city in a most pompous procession After being treated with the utmost external respect they were dismissed without obtaining the end of their embassy  I SHALL not attempt the description of this magnificent city but will content myself with speaking to the eyes by the plates of Mr  Nieuhoff  which I believe represent with great fidelity the various cities pagodas and other buildings he passed by in these may be seen the different forms of houses and public edifices The splendor of the emperor's palace and a general view of the city are shewn in the th page The pagodas  the idols in various other pages and the customs and dresses of the inhabitants are most frequently exhibited In respect to the gardens of the  Chinese  those of the private men are mentioned in the second volume of the  Chinese  Miscellany and those of the emperor most admirably described by  Le Frere Attiret  painter to the reigning monarch in  I NOW return to the latitude of  Canton  COASTS OF CHINA  and pursue the topography of the coasts By reason of the great rigor with which the  Chinese  exercise their prohibition of trading in any of their ports except  Canton  our knowledge of the shores or harbors is very confined We shall have very little to say of an extent of between two and three thousand miles of coast following the bending of the outline the whole of which appears strangely rugged with promontories divided by bays harbors and creeks  THE  Ladrone  isles  LADRONE ISLES  and those of  Lema  before the bay of  Canton  are lofty rude and broken that of the  Asses ears  takes its name from two hills that assume the form  Piedra Biancas  farther to the north is a very high rock of a white color both the last are marks to navigators  Footchien  the province adjoining to  Quangtung  on the north  FOOTCHIEN  is a mountanous country but the mountains by the industry of the inhabitants are formed into amphitheatres with terraces which often extend several miles in length and a series of twenty or thirty one above the other The account given by  Du Halde  Vol i  is so curious as to merit the attention of our readers These are planted with rice which is nourished by water forced  up to a great height and conveyed to the different plantations in pipes of bamboo This province is remarkable for its vast commerce opulence and population and also for its amazing fertility  AMONG the vegetable productions  ORANGES  it is distinguished for its fine oranges one is very large and its rind quite loose to the pulp which has the taste and smell of the muscadine grape This kind is candied and sent to all parts of the empire another is of a deep red and a third very small  China  is the native place of oranges from whence they were communicated to the western world  THE  Lichi  and  Longywen  are fruits peculiar to the more southern parts of this empire  LICHI FRUIT  of most exquisite flavor especially the first which has of late years been most successfully introduced into  Bengal  Hyamen  AMWY  or the port of  Amwy  is an excellent road for ships in a deep bay beneath the shelter of the isle of  Amwy  in Lat ° ′ The island is flat and morassy and garrisoned by about six or seven thousand men Before the prohibitory edict it was much frequented by  European  ships The  Dutch  about the year made a treacherous attempt on the place they came with five ships and landed about three hundred men who entered the town the greater part of the inhabitants fled but cunningly left in their houses abundance of spirituous liquors this proved the bait they intended The  Dutch  intoxicated themselves to a great degree of this the fugitive citizens had notice they returned surprised the invaders in their sleep and put them all to the sword The  Chinese  have preserved the history in large characters on the face of a smooth rock near the entrance of the harbor  ON the isle of  Amwy  is a vast rocking stone of forty tons weight moveable by the slightest touch  ROCKING STONE  Whether it is treated with superstitious respect as the  Britons  did their  Logganstone Hamilton  does not inform us A stone of this kind is found in  Cachemire  which the  Mullahs  or priests say is moved by the miraculous power of the saint to whom it is dedicated  THE great island of  Formosa  ISLE OF FORMOSA  or  Tawan  as it is called by the  Chinese  lies off the coast of  Footchien  at the distance of about sixty miles from the nearest place The length is ninety leagues the greatest breadth about thirty It is of a curvated form with the convexity facing the continent the tropic of  Cancer  passes over it at the distance of a hundred and five miles from the southern end almost dividing it in equal parts It is very singular that notwithstanding its proximity it was unknown to the  Chinese  till the year when a eunuch of that nation returning from the west was driven there by a tempest This was not immediately productive of any consequences nor did his countrymen profit of the discovery before the last century when in the reign of the emperor  KangHi  it was invaded by the famous  Coxinga  who conquered at last the western part not for the empire of  China  but for himself At that time the kings of  Quangtung  and  Footchien  had revolted from the empire As soon as their rebellion was quelled  Kanghi  in was put in possession of as much of  Formosa  as the young descendant of  Coxinga  had power to yield  THE  Japanese  seized on this island about the year The  Dutch  in their way from  Japan  about the year made here a settlement The manner of obtaining it and their future  expulsion has been given at p of this volume in my account of their first commerce in these parts with the empire of  China  THE coasts of  Formosa  are rude  PORT OF TAWAN  lofty and rocky The principal port is that of  Tawan  the same with that which the  Dutch  took possession of Near it is the capital city of the same name unfortified but garrisoned by ten thousand  Tartars  and very populous to which the  Chinese  who are a commercial people carry on a prodigious trade There are besides three other cities and several villages all inhabited by  Chinese  The whole is remarkably fertile productive of grain and all the fruits which the correspondent parts of  China  afford As the whole of the island was inhabited by a barbarous people domestic animals are in some degree scarce Oxen are in use for riding instead of horses stags abound and among the wild animals monkies but it does not appear that tygers or beasts of prey are known in any part of  Formosa  THE island is divided from north to south by chains of lofty and inaccessible mountains  NATIVES OF FORMOSA  The greater part of the western side is inhabited by  Chinese  the natives have the eastern entirely to themselves those which continue on the western are not better than servants to the colonists except the inhabitants of three out of the twelve districts formed by the  Chinese  which have revolted The  Formosans  are a fine people and of remarkable swiftness which they attain by practice so that they can outrun a horse at full speed Their shape is easy and slender their complexions olive and their hair fleck and hanging over their shoulders In the southern part of the isle they wear a linen wrapped round the middle and falling to the knees in  the northern the skin of a stag made into a sleeveless jacket Their bonnet is formed of  Banana  leaves adorned with tufts of the feathers of cocks or pheasants  THEIR morals have been much misrepresented by the  Chinese  and the Jesuits They have no external worship but a strong notion of a Supreme Being which renders them a quiet honest and benevolent race An inveterate hatred subsists between them and the  Chinese  The last had reason to suppose that the island had its gold mines but as they could not discover them in their part they equipped a ship and sailed to the eastern They were received by the natives in the most humane manner invited on shore and furnished with every necessary In this visit the  Chinese  observed in the poor cottages a few ingots of gold left negligently as if of no value This excited their avarice they made their hosts drunk and in their sleep cut all their throats and carried away the gold the incitement to this horrid action  IT must not be forgotten  OF PSALMANAZAR  that the history of  Formosa  was written by a person who pretended to be a  Japanese  converted to christianity and to have fled from his country to avoid the dreadful punishment inflicted by the emperor on all proselytes He assumed the name of  Psalmanazar  and is generally supposed to have been born in the south of  France  He was a man of uncommon abilities After leading a vagabond life through various parts of  Europe  in which he acted the part of a most consummate impostor and suffering frequently the greatest misery from his profligate life he was reduced to become a common soldier in a  Scotch  regiment at  Sluys  there he first assumed the character of the  Japanese Innes  a worthless chaplain of  the corps undertook his conversion not through principle but the hopes of promotion on his arrival in  England Innes  had discovered him to be an impostor but for their joint interest they united in the deceit  Psalmanazar  formed a  Formosan  alphabet he pretended to be converted in form was baptized by  Innes  by the name of  George  and the credulous governor of  Sluys  stood godfather  Innes  had by his correspondence with the good  Compton  the bishop of  London  been encouraged to bring him to our capital The prelate was made most completely the dupe of these villains  Psalmanazar  had many patrons and many opponents but his abilities and impudence baffled all detection He undertook a history of  Formosa  which he pretended was subject to  Japan  a most fabulous composition yet as the  English  are always delighted with the marvellous it was so greedily bought up as to induce him to prepare a second edition  Innes  attained his end got preferment and then basely deserted the cause of his promotion  Psalmanazar  lived some time by various tricks and impostures At length at the age of thirtyeight he began to feel compunction at the infamy of his life and was struck with most sincere remorse He became a most lively penitent and applied his great abilities to useful learning He wrote his own life which was not to be published till after his death I believe it to be a true narrative and that he concealed nothing but his real name and the place of his birth fearing to leave reproach upon his family The list of his works many of which are on important subjects may be found in the  Gentleman's Magazine  Vol xxxv p  He lived till  August  when he died  at the age of eighty having long led an exemplary life fully atoning for the irregularity of his early career  THE isles of  Pongho  form an  Archipelago  off the western coast of  Formosa  having the tropic passing over them  ISLES OF PONOHO  They are destitute of all the necessaries of life even to fuel so that every thing must be brought from  Formosa  to supply the  Chinese  garrison They consist of only rocks or sand yet as they possess a fine port which  Formosa  is destitute of they become essential in the preservation of that great island The  Dutch  built a fort at the entrance of the harbor of which nothing except the name remains The  Chinese  remember it by that of the fort of the  Red hairs  It was the famous  Coxinga  who took these islands from the  Dutch  and kept them for his own use  THE province of  TcheTchiang  continues the maritime parts of  China  from  Footchien  This like the rest  TCHETCHIANG  is amazingly commercial remarkable for its rich silks embroidered with gold and silver for its timber vast forests of the useful  bamboo  for its mushrooms hams and the vegetable tallow  SALT  Salt is made in abundance along the shores and serves to cure the quantities of fish taken on the coasts which are packed in barrels and sent to the more distant provinces The salt itself is transported to several of the internal parts within any reasonable distance but those which border on  Tartary  are supplied from certain saltpits providentially given for the use of the inhabitants  For many interesting particulars relating to the preparation of salt in  China  the reader is reserted to Sir George Staunton's Account of the Embassy vol ii p E    THIS province  PROVINCES GAINED FROM THE SEA  and that of  Kyangnan  are supposed to have  been gained from the sea as  Holland  was by the  Dutch  The period is not justly known The tradition of the  Chinese  is that there had been a mighty deluge in all probability that of  Noah Du Halde  Du Halde vol i p  attributes to the emperor  Yau  the vast works which recovered these provinces from the sea I will not dispute the learned Jesuit's skill in chronology but the emperor began his reign in before  Christ  and reigned a hundred years the period in which he was born could not therefore have been long after the universal deluge  Le Poivre  also informs us that these provinces were some thousand years ago covered with water and regained from the sea by the industry of the inhabitants The immense mounds which guard it from the fury of the waves are stupendous marks of the power of labor exerted by a most populous nation They exceed all the similar dikes of  Holland  besides they have a much more powerful sea to resist than that which beats on the coast of the  European  low countries  Montesquieu  attributes to the industry of the natives of these two provinces their superior fertility to any in the  Chinese  empire  In Lat  ISLE OF CHEWSHAN  ° at a small distance from the coast is the island of  Chewshan  or as we call it  Chusan  mentioned in this volume at p as the first settlement the  English  had in  China  It is surrounded with many little isles the remotest of which constitutes the most eastern part of the great curved shore of the empire  AT the bottom of a long estuary stands the city of  Ningpo  NINGPO OR LIMPO  known to the  Europeans  by the  Portuguese  name of  Liampo  or  Limpo  It is seated in the midst of a fine plain cultivated like a  garden surrounded with hills and divided by a principal canal branching from it with sixtysix others On one of these canals between  Shauhingfoo  and this city is an example of the singular method of passing from one level to another and seemingly a very awkward one  Embassy to China  vol ii p and plate of the solio volume E  The waters of one canal not being on a level with that of another the boat by means of two capstans is hoisted upon a stone glacis or slope which being made slippery with water the boat glides down into the second canal as swift as an arrow out of a bow For this reason they are made in form of  Gondolas  with keels of a wood hard enough to sustain the weight of a bark These boats are proper only for carrying goods from  Ningpo  and the towns depending on it as far as the canal of  Shauhing  They differ much both as to size and make from the imperial barks which would be broken to pieces or at least receive some considerable damage in the descent  Ningpo  carries on a considerable trade with  Batavia Siam  and  Japan  The  Portuguese  had early a settlement in this city where they acquired immense wealth and with it all the vices attendant on riches Insolent and highly debauched  PROFLIGACY OF THE PORTUGUESE  they dared to seize the most beautiful young girls they could hear of and employed a set of profligates for that purpose When they had kept these poor victims as long as they thought proper they returned them to the unhappy parents Enraged at this the  Chinese  cut off a party of the infamous  Chasseurs  The  Portuguese  had the audacity to complain the affair was brought before the highest tribunal and such scenes of iniquity were discovered that a decree was immediately made that the  Portuguese  should instantly quit the empire thus says  Hamilton  Vol ii p  "ended the most opulent colony at that time in the world"  To the north of this city an open bay runs deeply westward into the country the vast estuary of the river  Tchentangtchiang  The great city  Hangtchoo  stands at some distance from its discharge into the bay  HANGTCHOO  on a spot where the river is a league broad here is carried on a great manufactory of silk as the province is distinguished for the cultivation of the worm In  Hangtchoo  sixty thousand workmen live within the walls and several hundred thousand in the adjacent country  NEAR this city is a most beautiful little lake called  Sihû  SIHÛ LAKE  about two leagues in compass The water quite crystalline causeways are made through it for the convenience of walkers and elegant open halls raised on posts for the amusement of the citizens It is full of the famous golden fish  GOLDEN FISH  which shew to great advantage among the leaves and flowers of the  Nymphaea  with which the lake is filled This favorite fish of the  Chinese  is found in many other provinces here it forms a species of commerce the spawn and fry being transported to all parts of the empire which do not produce them  THE golden fish is of the most vivid colors  Linnaeus  names it  Cyprinus auratus  the gold is highly resplendent but varies in part of the same fish into the brightest silver or richest blues which can be imagined It seldom reaches the length of eight inches commonly is much smaller has one dorsal sin which sometimes is wanting and the back marked by one or two small protuberances in many the tail is most remarkable being so formed as to exhibit  the appearance of two and even three tails Mr  Edwards  tab and  Bloch  iii tab give figures of the varieties They have been introduced into all parts of  Europe  and will not only live but multiply prodigiously in our little stews  Du Halde  gives the following account of the treatment of them in  China  The next thing remarkable says the accurate historian is the  Kinyu  or golden fish these are kept either in little ponds made for that purpose wherewith the houses of pleasure belonging to the princes and great lords are embellished or else in basins that commonly adorn the courts of their houses in these basins which are more deep than wide they put the least that can be found for the smaller they are they think them the more beautiful besides the greater number may be kept of them and they afford more diversion  THE prettiest of them are of a curious red speckled as it were with gold dust especially towards the tail which is forked with two or three points some are of a silver color others white and some spotted with red both sorts are extraordinary lively and active delighting to play on the surface of the water but then their smallness renders them so tender that the least impression of air and even any violent shaking of the vessel will kill great numbers of them Those that are bred in ponds are of various sizes some are bigger than our largest pilchards they teach them to rise up to the top of the water at the noise of a clapper which the person uses who feeds them What is most surprising is that according to all accounts the best way to preserve them is to give them  nothing in winter it is certain they do not feed them for three or four months at  Peking  while the very cold weather lasts what they live on in the mean time under the ice it is not easy to understand except we suppose either that they find little worms in the roots of herbs which grow at the bottom of the ponds or else that pieces of roots themselves being softened by the water become proper food for them but those which to prevent their being frozen are taken into the houses and kept all winter in a chamber often shut up in a china vessel without being fed at all are towards spring put into the basins again where they sport with the same strength and agility as they did the year before One would imagine they knew their masters and those who carry them food by their being so ready to rise at their approach The greatest lords themselves delight in feeding them with their own hands and spend some time to observe their nimble motions and sporting in the water  FROM the estuary of the  Tchentangtchiang  the land bends towards the northwest  PROVINCE OF KYANGNAN  The next province to  Tchetchang  is  Kyangnan  On the southern side of the entrance into the bay of the great river leading to  Nanquin  ISLE OF TSONGMING  is the island of  Tsongming  ninety miles in length in the breadth about twenty It was originally a sandy spot overrun with reeds to which it was customary to banish robbers and all kinds of profligates necessity compelled them to industry they cleared the ground sowed the few seeds they brought with them and by the assistance of some  Chinese  who came from the continent to settle among them made a barren land fruitful Other families arrived the  island was divided among them and the shares granted in perpetuity on the payment of a small yearly rent of the produce of their labor It is at present well stocked with buffaloes and hogs and bears the usual grain and fruits of the neighboring continent among the last it is remarkable for its fine peaches  THE approach to  Nanquin  is now very difficult the channel being obstructed by sand so that the greater ships cannot enter The  Chinese  possibly might remedy this but it is supposed they wished rather to promote their inland trade than launch into distant commerce  THE great and rapid  Whanghohoo  also empties itself into the ocean near the northern boundary of this province  RIVER WHANGHO  Some leagues farther opposite to the little isle  Yuntayshan  in about Lat ° ′ begins the province of  Shantung  From thence the land changes its course and trends to the northeast as far as  Chinshanwey  The correspondent coast to  China  all the way from the mouth of the  Yellow  river is the kingdom of  Korea  and the intermediate space is named  Whanghay  or the  Yellow  sea The promontory of  Shantung  advances greatly  YELLOW SEA  and forms the entrance into the gulph of  Pecheli  which is bounded by part of the province of  Shantung  of  Pecheli  and of  Lyauting  a portion of  Chinese Tartary  and finally by the western coast of  Korea  WITHIN the gulph in Lat ° ′  TENCHOOFOO  is the city and port of  Tenchoofoo  On the part of the province more salient towards the north a number of small isles stretch out still further This port is a very fine one and has a strong garrison and fleet to guard the coast  AMONG the productions of this province is the famous worm producing the silk mentioned by  Pliny  Lib vi c  SILK OF PLINY  which that naturalist with other antient writers believed to have been a vegetable combed from the leaves and branches of trees I vindicate his opinion so far as to say that it was collected from a plant but he was ignorant that it was the produce of an insect  Du Halde  Vol i p  gives an account of its history but leaves us in the dark as to the species of insect which yielded this kind of silk Speaking of a certain sort of silk manufactured at  Trinan  a city of this province he says that the stuffs named  Kyenchow  incline to a greyish color which is produced only by the wild worms resembling caterpillars These worms spin their webs on shrubs and bushes and furnish as great quantities as the domestic worms This silk is the more estimable as it costs in a manner nothing and so strong that the goods made of it are very lasting and have a tolerable vent every where  THE gulph  PROVINCE OF PECHELI  from  Tenchoofoo  retires far towards the south then returns northward and in Lat ° ′ begins the province of  Pecheli  which in Lat ° takes a northcastern direction and on the gulph finishes this great empire in Lat ° The capital  Peking  is about a hundred miles from the mouth of the  Peiho  TIANSIN PORT OF PEKING  on which is  Tiansin  the port of the capital The river flows far to the southwest out of the lake  Tayhoo  A canal joins it about thirty miles from the sea and receives the vessels which are to discharge their ladings near to the imperial residence This province was conquered in about from the  Tartars  by  Taytsu  the first emperor of the dynasty of  My  g  he took the capital  Peking  in one day erected the country into a sovereignty and vested it in his fourth son  THE empire ends about miles farther in Lat ° ′  GREAT WALL  Here begins the celebrated wall completed two hundred and twentyone years before  Christ  by the emperor  Tsingchiwhung  to protect the northern parts of  China  from the incursions of the  Tartars  It appears first in the very sea on a vast bulwark founded on a number of ships sunk by a wonderful weight of huge stones to render immoveable the terminating superstructure The wall is all the way from twenty to twentyfive feet high generally cased with brick and terrassed at top of a breadth sufficient for five or six horsemen to ride abreast It passes along the frontiers of the provinces of  Pecheli Shansi  and  Shensi  is guarded by a series of square towers or forts at proper intervals of only two bowshots asunder and has its gates often of a vast size with rooms adjacent fitted up as  places d'armes  and peculiarly well garrisoned At no great distance in several cities general officers are posted with considerable bodies of troops The generalissimo resides at  Kanchoo  Many of these cities are the magazines for the articles of commerce brought from different parts to be transported into the various provinces of the empire  THIS great protection of  China  is not uniformly built of the same materials In some places the walls and even the forts are of earth In the district of  Ninghya  a few leagues from the city of the same name the mountains are so high and precipitous as to supply the necessity of a wall for the space of ten leagues In other places it is carried along vast and rugged mountains almost  inaccessible yet the fears of the  Chinese  urged them to prolong their defence even over the sides or summits of these alps which direct its course according to the nature of the country over deep vallies or level plains In a certain tract a great trench is cut to supply the place of the wall and on the banks of the fierce river  Whangho  or the yellow are series of sentryboxes filled with soldiers who keep watch night and day As the wall must in its course pass over various great rivers arches or bridges of a stupendous height and strength are thrown over them  Later emperors  SECOND WALL  to give greater security to their capital have built a second wall at some distance from  Peking  as strong as the first It is called the great inner wall and unites with the other by  Wenwhafu  Near it is a city which rises and falls with the form of the mountain it is built on and amazes the spectators with the boldness of the structure  THE length of the wall in a strait line is seven or eight hundred miles and allowing for the windings for the ascents over the craggy mountains or descent into the deep vallies may be estimated at double that length Yet what may justly excite our admiration is that this stupendous work was said to have been completed in the space of five years In this empire of obedience every power was exerted to perform the commands of their common father issued forth for the common security  IMMEDIATELY beyond this bulwark begins the country of the antient  Liautong  LIAUTONG  or part of that of the  Manchew Tartars  the last conquerors of  China  and who gave the present imperial family to the throne The gulph of  Liautong  runs deeply into the north of the country from the foot of the  Chinese  wall This  territory has also its guard but no better than a precinct of palisadoes with a few mean gates The capital  Mugden  which the  Manchews  look on as their metropolis has a  Tartarian  commander in chief and is inhabited by multitudes of  Chinese  who carry on the trade of  Tartary  Just without the gates are the magnificent tombs of their antient princes Paper made of cotton is a great manufacture of this country its principal use is for the sash windows of the palaces and houses of men of rank in  Peking  those of glass have not reached even the cold latitude of so splendid a people  GINGSENG  Gingseng  the celebrated medicinal plant of the  Chinese  is found in this country and many parts of  Chinese Tartary  of  Korea  and even in the provinces of  Shansi  and  Honan  in  China  itself but the latter is of an inferior kind It grows on the steeps of wooded mountains or rocks and on the banks of deep rivers The root which is applied to use is said to be of the shape of a man There is not a physician of eminence but who has celebrated its virtues and exactly in the style of our empyrics "It fortifies" says  ShiChin  the noble parts keeps the body in good plight fixes the animal spirits cures the palpitations occasioned by sudden frights dispels malignant vapours clears the sight opens and dilates the heart and strengthens the judgment When it is taken a considerable time together it makes the body light and active and prolongs life  In a few words there is not a disease incident to the human body but what it infallibly cures The  Manchews  style it  Orhota  the  most noble  or  queen of plants  others the  golden well bordered with pretious stones  There are extant nine antient receipts and sixtynine  modern  GINGSENG  The value of the root increases it was formerly worth its weight in silver "at present" says  Du Halde  Vol ii    it is sold for nearly its weight in gold  IN when the great  Kanghi  was on one of his progresses into his  Manchew  dominions he was desirous to give his favorite  Tartarians  a valuable perquisite and sent ten thousand of his soldiers to collect all the  Gingseng  they could find Each was to give him two ounces of the best and to receive for the remainder an equal weight of fine silver They sallied forth and collected in the year twenty thousand pounds weight but suffered sufficiently for they were allowed neither tent or any sort of covering and the places of search swarmed with tigers Those who did not return on the signal of moving their quarters were supposed to have been devoured by those dreadful animals  IN the  Chinese  dominions  Gingseng  grows between the thirtyninth and fortyseventh degree north Latitude and between ten and twenty east Longitude from  Peking  but is not confined to the old world it was discovered in  Canada  in by M  Sarrasin  who sent specimens to  Paris  It was introduced into  England  in by the worthy  Peter Collinson  and now flourishes in  Kew  garden  Linnaeus  first called this plant  Sion Ninsi  afterwards  Panax quinquefolium Ehret  in  Trew  tab names it  Araliastrum  and  Catesby  Appendix tab  Aureliana Canadensis  after  Lafilau  Doctor  Woodville  i retains the  Linnaean  name  IN  America  it is not confined to  Canada  IN AMERICA ALSO  It is found even as  far south as  Virginia  Gronov Fl Virg  being discovered on the shady hills and vallies of that state towards the end of the last century by doctor  John Clayton  The six  Indian  nations call it  Garangtoging  or the  human thighs  The Europeans have imported a great deal into  China  but it is not in the same esteem says  Osbeck  in which the roots of the  Chinese  dominions are held The Indians of  America  do not apply them to any use but multitudes are employed in collecting them for sale to the merchants of  Quebec  Our physicians depreciate the virtues of this root so much that notwithstanding it has found a place in our dispensatory yet is not mentioned in the  Pharmacopoeia  of the London College The power of the medicine may possibly have been exaggerated in  China  but I never can believe that a root so universally esteemed in that empire for ages can be destitute of virtues Father  Jartoux  speaks highly of its qualities from his own experience and on the very spot  Phil Trans Abrig iv part ii p  To him I give full credit but at the same time shall observe that the trial he made was from the fresh roots The experiments on which the  English  physicians founded their opinion were from dried and exhausted specimens  ADJACENT to the eastern side of  Liautong  is the peninsula of  Korea  KOREA  extending from Lat ° ′ to Lat ° bounded on one side by the gulph of  Pecheli  and the approach to it on the eastern by the  Japanese  gulph  Japan  extends the whole length of the coast and even stretches beyond its southern part  Korea  is of an oblong form about a hundred leagues in breadth its greatest length extends a hundred and eighty  ITS SITUATION  It lies between three mighty nations so that the inhabitants are a mixed people  but call themselves of  Tartar  origin boast of great antiquity and produce some books which are two or three thousand years old They have been conquered by the  Chinese Japanese  and  Tartars  since the conquest of  China  by the latter their yoke has been light they only are obliged to send four ambassadors to  Peking  annually to perform homage where after their audience from the emperor they remain in a state of confinement till their return The  Chinese  fear that some time or other they may unite with the  Russians  who have advanced far towards the  Chinese  frontiers this may occasion a revolt and the consequences prove fatal to the repose of the empire  Korea  had its wall to the northwest which has long since been in a ruinous state but even when complete did not prevent the conquest of the country by the  Manchew Tartars  THE  Korea  is mountainous and not very fertile except the vales It is full of woods and produces most of the European fruits and foresttrees The southern part yields rice and excellent grain It breeds a hardy race of horses exclusive of a small variety not three feet high also cows and black swine abounds with various animals among others are numbers of tigers the skins of which are a considerable article of commerce in their intercourse with  Japan  Among the noxious reptiles are crocodiles of an enormous size  THEY have great quantities of feathered game and a variety of birds possibly many of those we have described in the  Arctic Zoology  as belonging to the  Tartarian  or  Siberian  world But the species of the pheasant kind with feathers of the tail three feet long are confined to this country The feathers are sent  from  Korea  an article of commerce to various parts of the  Chinese  empire  THE natives of the northern part are a fine race of men tall  NATIVES  robust active and without any of the  Tartarian  aspect Those of the southern part resemble the  Chinese  of a sallow complexion and tender constitutions  THEIR government is regular  GOVERNMENT  and its customs and laws resemble those of the  Chinese  This makes it likely that their origin may more safely be derived from  China  than  Tartary  The  Chinese  pretend that they were subdued as early as the reign of  Yau  eighth emperor from  Fohi  which may well account if true for the similitude of laws and customs Their rulers are absolute and sole masters of the land which is granted to every man according to his family but the personal estate descends from father to son Their religion is that of  Fo  with all its superstitions they are very fond of literature and have triennial examination of Doctors Bachelors and Masters of arts These adopt the pure doctrine of  Confucius  and despise the ridiculous idolatry of  Fo  THE  Koreans  of rank are very splendid in their habits wear fur caps and brocade cloaths and affect purplecolored silk richly ornamented with gold and silver Furs are much in use The learned are distinguished by two feathers in their caps  THE productions of the country are  Ginseng  cotton paper  PRODUCTIONS  gold silver iron mineral salt the skins of sables and beavers and a beautiful varnish which resembles gilding made from the gum of a tree  THE natives carry on a great commerce with  China  TRADE  about  sixty merchants attend the annual ambassadors they travel in  March  and cross the ice of the gulph in sledges so severe is the cold even in this latitude Others go in  August  in large vessels discharge their cargoes in the  Chinese  ports and carry it by land to  Peking  They bring with them great quantities of the window paper umbrellas fine mats tobacco striped cotton furs and dried fish taken from a large shell on the coast of  Japan  This dried fish is only a covert to the other articles of commerce They import besides great quantities of gold and silver in ingots and part in  Spanish Pistoles  and carry back prodigious cargoes of raw and fine silk which they manufacture at home thin silks the kind called by the  Chinese KaoliToanza  or  Korean  damask tea vast quantities of cotton china ware and white copper vessels of all sorts  THAT penetrating writer Mr  Campbell  has given an excellent account of the commerce of this people My plan is of that confined nature that I must content myself with a reference and request the reader's perusal of Mr  Campbell  's  Vol ii  account in his collection of voyages which will amply repay them  THE  Koreans  trade openly with  China  WITH CHINA c  clandestinely with  Japan  the  Phillippine  isles and perhaps  Java  under the general notion of their being  Chinese  they may traffick in disguise to many other places Their trade with the nations to the north and northwest and probably with the  Russians  of their  Asiatic  dominions comes under the same description all this is strictly prohibited by the  Chinese  emperor who even keeps a Mandarine at the  Korean  court to take care that the order be observed this precaution with so corrupt a nation has very little effect  THE intercourse to the north  RUSSIANS  is the most dreaded by the  Chinese  The  Russians  have made great advances on that side and had formed settlements on the  Amur  which runs through the northern part of the empire This brought on more than one war The  Koreans  are said either to navigate the river  Songor  or the  Schingal  till they arrive in the  Amur  or to sail along the coast and proceed directly up its mouth and trade either with the subjects of  Russia  or possibly with the  Russians  themselves All the intervening track from  Korea  is affectedly given wrong by the  Chinese  in order to keep both their own subjects and those of  Russia  in ignorance but in vain the  Koreans  are a match for them in cunning They pretend in their voyage up the  Amur  that they come from some distant isle  Ysbrande Ides  informs us of this but without knowing that they imposed on him They trade even with the  Manchew Tartars  subjects of the emperor but these people for gains sake content themselves with the deception From them and from the  Russians  or  Russian  subjects they procure the quantities of furs which they pretend are the produce of their own country  THE  Koreans  having their country three parts surrounded by the sea must naturally be a naval people they trade commonly with  Japan  and obtain the articles of commerce of those islands  WITH JAPAN  The  Japanese  have ceded the little intermediate isle of  Susima  the  Tuitatao  of the  Koreans  on purpose to facilitate the trade  By the pretence of sailing to the island of  Quelpraet  seated to the south of the peninsula to take in the  Chinese  manufacture  from the magazines formed there they proceed on the east side of  Formosa  MANILLA  and to  Manilla  where they trade under the name of  Chinese  and by this means acquire such quantities of  Spanish  silver they likewise get abundance of ducats in  Japan  exchanging their ingots for specie with this silver they pay for great part of the manufactures of  China  THEY do not purchase any  European  goods in  China  yet  Korea  abounds with those of our distant world these are procured in the  Phillippines  or at  Batavia  spices and several other insular commodities are bought in the same market from that of  Manilla  they bring amethysts and emeralds the last certainly from the mines of  Atacames Manta  and  SantaFe  Ulloa vol i  in  Spanish America  Their intercourse with the Oriental islands must have been long for Mr  Campbell  observes that the people who were so cruelly murdered by the  Dutch  in  Amboina  in the year for the pretended conspiracy with the  English  were  Koreans  and not as they are called  Japanese  But there is no limiting the period of trade among these distant nations forward as we have shewn them to be in the arts of navigation  I SHALL conclude the account of this singular country with a view of the adjacent nations whether dependent or independent on this mighty empire  THE kingdoms on the south are  Tonquin  and  Laos  NATIONS ADJACENT TO THE CHINESE EMPIRE AVA THIBET  a small part of  Pegu  advances a little into the southwest and the northern end of  Ava  borders on the lower part of the province of  Yunan Thibet  is adjacent to the provinces of  Sechwen  a great  part of  Shensi  and the upper part of the last is bounded by  Hokonor Tartars  in their country is a large lake of the same name in Lat These  Tartars  have among them a coarse woollen manufacture which they dispose of to the  Chinese  Inaccessible and rude mountains lie to the south of that people inhabited by a most savage race so as to cut them off from all intercourse with the still more southern countries  LET me here introduce some account of the celebrated drug  OF RHUBARB  the Rhubarb of which  Tartary  and  China  is the seat The rhubarb of all the medicinal kinds is found in great abundance in several parts of the  Chinese  dominions and even in  China  itself In the province of  Sechwen  in the mountains of  Snow  in  Shensi  where troops of camels are loaden with nets full of rhubarb in the months of  October  and  November  it abounds also in  Tanguth  about the lake  Kokonor Little Bucharia  and all the chain of hills from lake  Baikal  westward It grows south as far as  Quangtung  but the southern rhubarb is little esteemed yet much of it comes to  Europe  by sea I may add that out of the  Chinese  empire it is found in  Thibet  RHUBARB was known to  Dioscorides  who lived in the reign of  Nero  as a valuable purge and  Paulus Aeginetus  a physician of the seventh century prescribed it for the same purpose It was brought from the remotest parts of the ancient  Scythia  and the use was continued through all succeeding ages without any certain knowledge of the plant to which the roots belonged  Marco Polo  observed it on the rocky mountain near  Suchur  in the province of  Tanguth  and says it was sent to all parts of the earth for it found its way to  Europe  from those distant regions even in that early time  Gerard  P  gives a figure of the well known rhubarb of our gardens with roundish crisped leaves This he names very properly  Rha verum antiquorum Parkinson  gives another  P  in his  Paradisus terrestris  which he procured from Doctor  Mathew Lister  physician to  Charles  I This is acknowledged from both their accounts to be weaker than the other kind which came from  China  it is frequent in our gardens I do not remember that the roots were ever applied to medicinal uses but of the tender shoots of the leaves are made excellent tarts in the early summer not inferior in taste to the codling  THE plants which produce the true rhubarb have been but lately discovered the seeds of the  Rheum Palmatum  were sent from  Russia  by the late Doctor  Mounsey  to Doctor  Hope  of  Edinburgh  in He sowed them in the botanical garden they succeeded greatly and he with his usual liberality communicated them to the curious He drew up an account of the plant and inserted it attended with most accurate plates in vol lv p of our Phil Transactions Doctor  Woodville  gives also a good figure of the plant at p of his medicinal botany as to that referred to by  Linnaeus Le Brun  's travels i p it seems of some other species of  Rheum  The  Rheum Rhaponticum  cultivated in our  English  gardens F    THAT most excellent character the Duke of  Athol  CULTIVATED IN SCOTLAND  propagated it with great success not only in his garden but on the highland mountains that surround his seat at  Athol  His benevolent design of rendering common and cheap this useful medicine is blest with the utmost success The roots which he cultivated in the light soils similar to those of the  Tartarian  deserts  the native place encrease to a vast size some when fresh have been found to weigh fifty pounds and to be equal in smell taste and effect to those we import at an enormous expence to our country On being dried they shrink to one quarter of their original weight There is reason to suppose that the  Scotch  rhubarb may be superior in virtue to the foreign the last being gathered in all seasons as the  Mongall  hunters chance to pass by They draw up the roots indiscriminately pierce them at one end sling them on their belts and leave them to dry on their tents without further care In all probability the time is not remote in which the  British  rhubarb will supersede the necessity of the use of the foreign  BUT there are other kinds which are said to be equally efficacious with the  Rheum Palmatum  such as the  Rheum Rhabarbarum  of  Linnaeus  the  Undulatum  of the  Hortus Kewensis  with long waved leaves the  Rheum Compactum  a third species boasts of the same virtues  Miller  had the seeds sent to him as those of the true kind The  Rheum Rhaponticum  is besides met with in  Tartary  about lake  Baikal  as well as most of the others This is the species which gave the name of  Rhubarb  or rather  Rhabarb  to this drug the plant being first observed near to the banks of the ancient  Rha  or river  Volga  the same prescribed by  Paulus Aeginatus  as one of the ingredients for a purge under the name of  Rheum Ponticum  perhaps the trivial might be derived from its being brought from some part of  Pontus  to which it was carried from its place of growth  Pliny  Lib xxvii c  mentions a plant with a medicinal root called  Rhacoma  he says it came  from the countries beyond the kingdom of  Pontus  and by the name probably from the  Rha  He describes its uses but none of them are similar to that of the rhubarb I cannot therefore venture to say that it is the same plant  IN  Chinese Tartary  the  Bobak Marmots  Hist Quad ii N  o  are said to be the propagators of Rhubarb Wherever ten or twenty plants grow you are sure of sinding several burrows under the shades of their broad spreading leaves It is probable the manure they deposit about the roots contributes not a little to its increase and their casting up the earth makes it shoot out young buds and multiply It appears that the  Mongalls  never accounted it worth cultivating but that the world is obliged to the  Marmots  for the quantities scattered at random in many districts of this country For whatever part of the ripe seed happens to be blown among the thick grass can very seldom reach the ground but must there wither and die whereas should it fall among the loose earth thrown up by those animals it immediately takes root and produces a new plant  THE  Chinese  call rhubarb  Taywhang  they use it nearly in the same manner as is done in  Europe  esteem its virtues much as we do except that which comes from  Canton  the greatest part of the  Tartarian  or most valuable is engrossed by the  Russians  who purchase it at their town of  Kiachta  a little south of lake  Baikal  from  Bucharian  merchants and send it to  Petersburgh  This is called the  Turkey Rhubarb  because formerly it was brought from  Constantinople  the merchants there receiving it from the  Bucharians  who now find a readier market near home The  Chinese  prohibit the exportation of the best rhubarb under  severe penalties but much of it is procured either by concealing it mixed with roots of inferior quality or by a contraband trade The  Russian  government is very attentive to the business and appoints at  Kiachta  persons to inspect the drug and to reject all that is bad  ALL this extensive tract has a most elevated situation  ELEVATED COUNTRY  giving rise to numbers of great rivers which running southward water the several parts of  India  both  intra  and  extra Gangem  the  Ganges  itself is one the  Burrampooter  or  Tsampoo  of the  Chinese  another with the various contributary streams that fall into those amazing rivers the river of  Arrakan  may be added to the list as to those of  Ava Pegu Siam  and  Cambodia  each of them originate in the south of  China  The elevated plains of this part of  Asia  did not escape the notice of  Marco Polo  for he mentions his journey of twelve days over one called  Pamer  Bergeron p  and asserts that he found on those heights the fire to burn with difficulty by reason of the excessive cold and rarefaction of the air These plains are on the north of  Cashgur  and to the west of  Little Bucharia  THE immense deserts of  Gobi  or as the  Chinese  call them  DESERTS OF SHAMO  Shamo  and  Hankai  are dreadful boundaries to the north and northwest of the  Chinese  dominions They consist of sands that move with the winds like the current of a river Nature has formed three passagesacross them by means of three chains of mountains which run from the great  Tartary  and are mixed with pleasant vallies amidst these oceans of sand Travellers who take any other course are liable to be overwhelmed with the torrents of  sand equally dangerous with the deserts of  Arabia  The first of these communications is in Lat ° north to the E N E of  Peking  the second to the east of the province of  Shensi  and the third in Lat ° to the east of  Hami  on the frontiers of  Thibet  By these means a safe access was given from the vast  Tartarian  regions and through them from the countries bordering on the  Caspian  sea and more remotely from  Europe  itself they were the roads of the travellers and merchants of the middle ages  ADJACENT to the southwestern parts were some important cities well known to those adventurers  HIERKIN CASHGUR  such as  Hierkin  and  Cashgur  already mentioned in this work  Outlines of the Globe vol i p  to which  Ptolemy  gives the names of  Comedae  and  Casia Regio  the first is supposed to have been  Cashgar  the capital of  Casia Regio Hierkin  the  Carcham  of  Marco Polo  p is conjectured to have taken its name from its situation on the  Aechardes  a river which runs from the northeast and was remarkable as a station which merchants trading with the  Seres  had in the very neighborhood In the time of our great traveller the inhabitants were  Mahometans  intermixed with a few  Nestorians  Hoton  or  Coton  HOTON  a province to the southeast of  Hierkin  bordering on the desert is supposed to have belonged to the ancient  Chatae  It is very populous the inhabitants are commercial cultivate cotton  PEYM  flax hemp and wheat and make wine  Peym  is another province productive of Chalcedonies and Jaspers The capital of the same name is in Lat These places and many others mentioned by  Polo  are to be found in the modern maps  Lop  the city visited by  Marco Polo  lies in Lat °  LOP  and is seated on a lake which gave name in his time to the great desert At  Lop  the travellers always stop to provide themselves with mules or strong asses and provisions for their toilsome journey over the barren waste which takes a whole month  Marco Polo  seems to have crossed it in the most difficult part for the entire tract consisted of unstable sands or rugged mountains uninhabitable by even birds or beasts with scarcely any water and that usually bitter At length he arrived at the city of  Sachion  the modern  Shatcheu  at the entrance into the kingdom of  Tanguth  NOT far from thence is  Camul  CAMUL  a city to be found in the old maps  Polo  celebrates the great kindness of the inhabitants who on the arrival of any strangers immediately surrender to them their wives and houses and retire for the time to other habitations He adds that  Mangu Khan  shocked at the indecent custom directed them to build inns for the reception of the travellers This these contented  Cornuti  took in such ill part that they never rested till by presents and remonstrances they prevaled on the  Khan  to revoke the edict  FURTHER in Lat ° ′ Long ° from  Greenwich  KARAKARIN  stood  Karakarin  the  Holin  of the  Chinese  the capital of the antient  Mongois  founded before the twelfth century or the time of  Jenghiz Khan  It was previous to his reign an inconsiderable place and the residence of  Ung Khan  of the  Karaites  when  Jenghiz  wrested it from him The conqueror improved it greatly and his son  Oktay Khan  rebuilt it with great splendor about the year ten years afterward he surrounded it with  walls of no better materials than of mud but his palace called  Wangan  was of great magnificence  Rubriquis  P and  gives a full account of it to his master He informs us that  William  the  Goldsmith  was employed in the ornamental work The famous silver tree in one of the courts was in a fine taste  SILVER TREE  At the foot of the tree were four lions the same number of gilt serpents twined round the stem and their heads appeared out of the branches pointing different ways spouting various liquors one of wine another of  Caracosmos  or the liquor of mares milk the third made of honey the fourth of rice and each fell into a great silver cistern placed beneath On the summit of the tree was an angel with a trumpet which sounded by the help of a pipe blown by a man artificially concealed All this shewed taste in the  Khan  as well as beauty of design in the artist This city placed in the middle of the desert on a salient chain of mountains might well astonish the traveller with its population and the splendor of its palaces These parts of  Tartary  were about that period full of opulent cities but little more than the site of them or of  Karakarin  itself was discoverable by the Jesuits who were employed by the emperor in the vast work of the survey of his  Tartarian  dominions The labors of the Fathers  Regis Fidelli  and many others are comprised in twelve maps in the second volume of  Du Halde  In the third sheet is shewn the situation of this once famous city and in some of the others the whole of the desert which lies in the  Chinese  territories The chains of communication are expressed and the roads which the more hardy travellers ventured over amidst the trackless sands  THE part of this desert which is clamed by the  Chinese  begins in Lat ° north and in Long ° ′ east from  Paris  winds towards the northeast as high as  Halter Gobi  HALTER GOBI  in Lat ° and Long After running southwestward to the borders of  India  it skirts  Thibet  the country of the  Kokonor Tartars  and then the borders of the far projecting province of  Shensi  These tracts were known by the almost obsolete name of the once potent kingdom of  Tanguth  TANGUTH  Rubruquis  and  Marco Polo  travelled through and describe its flourishing state and the number of its cities The friar is the first who mentions the ox with a tail like a horse covered with silken hairs the grunting ox Hist Quad i N  o  since his days fully verified  Polo  in his road to  Tanguth  passed through the great desert which he names that of  Lop  During night says he the caravans are terrified with the delusions of demons which haunt these horrid sands The travellers must be careful how they stray for they will imagine themselves to be called by their proper names by some of their comrades till they are brought to the edge of a precipice and sometimes they will be entertained with aerial music Superstitions fitted to the dread of the place  IT afterwards passes between the country of the  Calmucs  and the  Kalkas  to the northwest the  Ortus Tartars  and the  Mongols  to the south and concludes its course of above two thousand miles from the borders of  India  to  Halter Gobi  its remotest extremity The extreme point to the southwest is not distant from the lakes  Lanke  and  Mansaroar  the sources of the  Ganges  and the lake which gives origin to the great  Burrampooter  EVEN these deserts do not want inhabitants some pittance is  found amidst the sands to support the  Takija  or wild horses the  Dshikketei  WILD MULES AND ASSES  or wild mules and the  Koulan  or wild ass I refer the readers to p vol i of my History of Quadrupeds for an account of those curious animals  THE  Chinese  empire in  Tartary  extends to the north as high as Lat ° ′ Its most western limit is not far from the southern end of lake  Baikal  in Lat ° ′ and Long ° ′ west from  Greenwich  It passes southward with some irregularity to the kingdom of  Thibet  and has on that side as a difficult limit the great desert of  Shamo  The northern boundary runs from the spot defined near lake  Baikal  eastward for some space then turns northward along a vast and lofty range of mountains the more antient seat of the  Mongols  and at their extremity not far from the source of the river  Aldan  in Lat ° ′ bends to the southeast and concludes in the sea in Lat ° ′ to the north of the river  Amur  All the tract between these lines and the empire of  China  Proper are inhabited by  Tartars  subject to or under the protection of the  Chinese  government For the further explanation I refer to my friend the Reverend  William Coxe  's  Russian  Discoveries  Page  and Mr  Arrowsmith  's Map of the World but above all to the Travels of Father  Gerbillon  and other Jesuits who followed the progresses of the great  Kanghi  or were employed in the actual survey of his vast empire Their travels are given in the second volume of  Du Halde  's History of  China  THE boundaries were settled in by the treaty of  Nertshinsk  TREATY OF NERTSHINSK  upon the river  Ingoda  in the reigns of  John  and  Peter  afterwards surnamed  The Great  and that of  Kanghi  The politic  Russians  had long been endeavoring to make themselves masters of the important navigation of the river  Amur  which in time might have given them the command of the  Japanese  and  Chinese  seas This the  Chinese  foresaw attacked and took a fort called  Albasin  built by the  Russians  They levelled it to the ground and carried the garrison prisoners into  China  This brought on an embassy from the  Russians Gallowin  governor of  Siberia  was the embassador attended by a most splendid train  So San  captain of the life guard and minister of state and  Tong Jauye  maternal uncle to the emperor were embassadors on the part of the  Chinese  both men of the highest rank and to them were added four others of the first distinction The cunning of the  Chinese  was assisted by the subtlety of the Jesuits for  Kanghi  added to the negotiators Father  Gerbillon  and Father  Pereyra  The  Chinese  ministers had a suite inferior indeed in magnificence but what gave the greater weight to the negotiation was that the wise  Kanghi  had added ten thousand men besides the escort and which were attended by a fleet of seventysix vessels each carrying a piece of artillery The  Russians  had fixed on  Albasin  as the place for settling the business but to their surprise the  Chinese  appeared suddenly before  Nertshinsk  or as they call it  Nipchu  encamped near the place and the whole business was transacted under tents All this gave argument irresistible The treaty was concluded The  Chinese  offered to swear to the performance on the crucifix  Gallowin  chose that they should swear by their own gods and both couched the sacred appeal in these terms imprecating the  Divine vengeance on the faithless party  We embassadors extraordinary of the two empires having been sent to settle the bounds of both dominions and establish a solid and perpetual peace between both nations which we happily executed in the conferences held by us in the seventh moon of the th year of  Kanghi  near the town of  Nipchu  by distinctly setting down in writing the names of the countries and places where the two empires join each other have by fixing the bounds of both and ordering in what manner such disputes as may fall out for the future are to be treated of have mutually received an authentick writing in which is contained the treaty of peace and have agreed that the said treaty with all its articles shall be engraven on stone to be fixed in the places appointed by us for the bounds of both empires to the end that all who pass by those places may be fully informed thereof and that this peace with all its conditions  OATH OF OBSERVANCE  may be for ever inviolably observed But should any one have the thought only or secret design to transgress these articles of peace or breaking his word and faith should violate them out of private interest or from the design of exciting new troubles and rekindling the fire of war we pray the supreme  Lord  of all things who knows the bottom of men's hearts not to suffer such people to live out their days but to punish them by an untimely death  I MAY here remark the observance of two very antient customs in the execution of this treaty  A ROMAN FORM  the one in the manner of the oath which agrees with that in use among the  Romans  of which  Polybius  has lest us the following form made on the occasion  and which remained in his days cut on tables of brass in the temple of  Jupiter Capitolinus  in the archives of the aediles  THE first of these treaties was confirmed by oath in the following manner The  Carthaginians  swore by the gods of their country and the  Romans  by a stone agreeably to an antient custom and by  Mars Enyalius  The ceremony of swearing by a stone was thus performed the person that was appointed to this office having first solemnly attested the publick faith for the due observance of the treaty took in his hands a stone and pronounced the following words'If I swear truly may the gods be propitious to me but if I think or act any thing that is contrary to my oath then let the rest enjoy in safety their country laws possessions household gods and sepulchres and let me alone be cast out from the society as this stone is now cast away' At the same time he threw away the stone  Hampton's Polybius book iii chap iii p    THE other custom was one of the earliest date on this very continent  COLUMNS MEMORIAL  that of preserving the memory of any remarkable transactions by pillars of stone Thus we find in  Genesis  Chap xxxi v  that the treaty between  Laban  and  Jacob  was confirmed and perpetuated by the erection of a pillar and a heap of stones The  Chinese  embassadors raised two pillars on the spot to determine the boundaries of the respective empires and on them engraved the treaty  IT was the intention of the  Russians  to have made the  Amur  the limits of their empire  RIVER AMUR  This vast river is formed originally  by the junction of the  Onoa  and the  Schilka  to the west of  Nertshinsk  From thence it flows easterly takes a vast bend southernly and then returns to the northeast and falls through a mouth four or five leagues wide into the lower part of the sea of  Ochotzk  opposite to the great island  Sachalin  in Lat ° The  Tartars  call the river  Sachalin ula  or the black river the  Chinese Helong Kiang  or the river of the  black dragon  and the  Russians  the  Amur  It was first known to them in by means of some  Cosacks  sent on an expedition towards the river  Witim  According to  Du Halde  Vol ii p  it is navigable for large barks for the space of five hundred leagues  THE  Russians  were charmed with the discovery of a river which report made to fling up gold and silver and its neighborhood to abound with the most pretious sables cattle fruit and grain and its inhabitants to be clad in nothing but damask and gold brocades in short it was represented as a land of  Canaan  The  Russian  colonists of the neighboring places migrated thither in crowds and depopulated their former country They founded a fort in Lat °  FORT ALBUSIN  which they called  Albasin  the  Chinese Jaksa  from the river near which it was seated The  Chinese  burnt it in but it was resounded and at length strongly garrisoned till it gave such serious cause of jealousy to that nation as to bring on the treaty which occasioned its total demolition It is no wonder that they were alarmed the borders of the river were remarkably fertile had numbers of large cities and a most populous territory besides the mountains to the  north were productive of the richest sables and other furs and inhabited by a hardy race of hunters Had the  Russians  rendered themselves masters of the  Amur  even  Katherine  the moderate might have made the  Chinese  tremble for the fate of  Peking  itself  THE  Chinese  had several places on the  Argun  of some importance such as  Aigun  or as it is called by them  AIGUN  Sachalin ula Choton  near the junction of the  Seja  with that great river a fort from which they detached their fleets against the  Russian  encroachments  Tondon  is another town in Lat ° where the cold begins with great severity as early as the beginning of  September  later in the year the greatest rivers are frozen over Tigers inhabit even these high Latitudes This country was visited and surveyed by some of the missionaries by order of  Kanghi  Whoever wishes to gratify his curiosity farther may consult  Du Halde  vol ii p and the following pages  THE country is full of forests the missionaries were nine days in passing through one They observed that the inhabitants of  Usuni  made use of sledges drawn by dogs and persons of rank have sometimes a hundred to relieve each other on long journies on the snows or frozen rivers The river of  Usuri  Du Halde  vol ii map the sixth  which rises far to the south and falls into the  Amur  abounds with fish mostly of species common to  Europe  These serve the  Ypi Tartars  for food and raiment  YPI TARTARS  They are very ingenious in dressing the skins which they dye of various colors cut them into shape and sew them so neatly that they appear like silk Sturgeons swarm in these waters The native  Tartars  make their boats of the bark of trees sewed lightly together  IT does not appear that the missionaries went farther than  Tondon  ISLE OF SAGALIN  The report they had of the great island of  Sagalin  or  Saghalian anga hata  or the island of the mouth of the  black river  was from some  Manchews  sent by the emperor in their barks For want of necessaries they were soon obliged to return They observed certain villages and that the inhabitants had neither horses or any beasts of burden but made use of a sort of tame stags rein deer to draw their sledges The island is said to be a hundred and eighty miles long and sixty broad All the coast of the continent from the part opposite to this island as low as the northern boundary of  Korea  is scarcely known it bounds the western side of the streights of  Yoso  What could be said of this obscure part and of the opposite islands will be delivered in a future

Asia  has been described in my ARCTIC ZOOLOGY what I have said in this serves to give all I can collect respecting that vast continent The islands to the north of  Formosa  must now be added the omission would render this volume incomplete for we should not only lose the account of the important island of  Japan  but break into the great chain which extends quite from the first of the  Malayan  to the  Kuril  isles already described in the above work  THE islands called by Mr  Arrowsmith  the  Tatpin  TATPIN ISLES  form a numerous group of small isles dependent on those we are just going to mention they lie not remote from the eastern side of  Formosa  with the tropic of Cancer passing over the southern end  THE isles of  Liquejo  or as they are called by the natives  Riuku  ISLES OF LIQUEJO  are the next they are seventy leagues to the northeast of  Formosa  the most considerable  Kintschin  which lies north and south between Latitudes ° ′ and ° ′ is about fifty leagues long and fifteen broad the east side and south end skirted by numbers of little isles and rocks the inhabitants are chiefly  Chinese  who fled from the  Tartars  at the time of the last revolution They were well received by the natives who speak a broken  Chinese  which argues their descent so that the new comers were considered as countrymen They are principally husbandmen and fishermen and are a most cheerful happy people diverting themselves after the labor of the day with a glass of rice beer and with their musical instruments which they take into the field with them A few centuries ago these islands were conquered by a prince of  Satzuma  a province of  Japan  who governed them by his lieutenants they still remain in the same state of dependence but are taxed with much gentleness The inhabitants also send annually to the emperor of  China  a gift in token of loyalty and submission They carry on a commerce with  Satzuma  and visit it once a year they have there a company of merchants but are confined in their commerce to that port and limited to the value of their trade but by the connivance of the  Japanese  officers they dispose of an infinitely greater quantity than the law admits They import into  Satzuma  all kinds of silks and stuffs and various  Chinese  commodities which they carry over in their own jonks and some of their own produce such as corn rice fruit and pulse and a sort of brandy made from the remainder of their crops They bring great quantities of the  Cypraeae Monetae  CYPRAEAE MONETAE  or cowries the same species which is found in the  Maldive  isles  Outlines of the Globe vol i p  from those shells is also prepared a white varnish with which the boys and girls paint their cheeks they besides export a sort of large flat shells which when polished are almost transparent and serve the  Japanese  for glass in their windows to these add some articles of luxury in various scarce flowers and plants brought in pots and a few other matters of a trifling nature Notwithstanding these people are really  subject to the  Japanese  they do not allow the emperor's supremacy yet like them they have a  Dairi  or hereditary ecclesiastical governor to whom they pay great respect and suppose to be lineally descended from the gods of their country he resides at the isle called by  Kaempfer  Hist of  Japan  p  to whom we are indebted for all this account  Jajama  not remote from  Osima  an island of second magnitude  THAT island another larger called  Tanaasima  TANAASIMA ISLAND  with several lesser extend north and south to the northeast of the  Liquejo  islands and form the links between them and  Japan  Between the isle of  Tanaasima  and that of  Liquejo  are the streights of  Van Diemen  that island is the most southern of those which compose the great empire of JAPAN and is the smallest of the number the latitude of the south end is ° north according to Doctor  Thunberg  and the most northerly of the  Japanese  islands extends to ° the longitude from ° to ° east The coasts are rude and rocky the circumambient seas raging with storms during nine months of the year  STORMY  are shallow filled with shoals and rocks and extremely subject to frequent shipwrecks Off this coast are two whirlpools dangerous and not less tremendous than those of the famous  Maelstrom  near the  Norwegian  shores there are frequent instances of ships being absorbed in the vortex and their shattered fragments slung up at the distance of many leagues The poets of  Japan  make constant allusions to these horrible phaenomena  THE climate of the  Japanese  isles like that of  Great Britain  is very changeable and subject to frequent rains fertilizing the ground as they do that of our island Thunder is frequent and earthquakes so common as never to be minded unless attended as has been often the case with dreadful consquences  THE summer heat is very great  HEAT  and scarcely tolerable when not alleviated by the winds it sometimes in  July  and  August  raises  Fahrenheit  's thermometer to ° The cold on the contrary is excessive and sinks the mercury many degrees below the freezing point especially when the winds blow from the north and the east in the northern parts there are mountains scarcely ever free from snow  THE whole empire is mountanous  SOIL  level meadows are unknown the fields of the vallies consist of a clayey soil sometimes sandy yet rendered fertile by the incredible industry of the inhabitants even the higher hills are cultivated to the very tops  IN my account of the objects of their labor  BOTANY  and the botanical productions I shall follow that able naturalist and traveller Doctor  Thunberg  who visited this empire in and even had the happiness of making a journey to its capital  Jedo  as yet we have only been favored by him with the  Flora  of the country  A translation of his travels was published in two years after this account of  Japan  was composed E  I shall not pursue the brief account of the vegetable productionssy stematically but class them as Doctor  Thunberg  has done according to their uses Japan has been fortunate in having been visited in by Doctor  Engelbert Kaempfer  one of the ablest naturalists and scholars of his time His  Amoenitates exoticae  and his travels into this empire render any other eulogium superfluous He will  be

Japanese  value the camphor of  Sumatra  and  Borneo  much more than their own and will give eighty or a hundred  Catti  of their boiled camphor for one of the  Bornean  the last is native and

Sp pl p  Kaempf Amoen  v p  TEA    Kaempfer  's Travels i ii appendix tab The tea cultivated in  Japan  is the  Bohea  the  Tsjaa  of the  Japanese  the  Theh  of the  Chinese  The origin of it has its legend equal to any in the universe  Darma  the son of an  Indian  king who flourished about the year of the  Christian  era arrived in  China  to preach his doctrine to the inhabitants It seems he was a sort of pope in  India  the twentyeighth in succession from the founder of eastern paganism He had vowed the greatest austerities particularly a perpetual watchfulness nature worn out was obliged at length to submit to the refreshment of sleep on finishing his slumbers he cut off both his eyebrows which had dared to close and flinging them on the ground each became a shrub  Darma  eat some of the leaves and to his great surprise found himself invigorated so as to undergo any labors or any watchings he communicated the virtues to his disciples and tea became of universal use It is therefore styled by some the eyebrows of  Darma  he is represented as a horrid ugly fellow with vast eyebrows wrapped in a great cloak and standing on a reed on which he had been wafted from region to region  WE may be certain from this tale that the tea plant was aboriginal of  China  It is cultivated by sowing not in whole fields but round the borders in rows so that it may not hurt the land good farmers manure the plants with human ordure In seven  years time it grows to the height of a man its few leaves at that time are gathered the shrub cut down and the most plentiful harvest is obtained from the vigorous shoots of the succeeding years  THE leaves are gathered by laborers peculiarly brought up to the business they must not be taken by handfuls but pulled off one by one The trees are not stripped entirely for there are three gatherings in the year The leaves are sorted into three parcels the finest the small tender primaeval shoots are reserved for princes and great men and on that account called imperial They are next prepared by drying over the fire in an iron pan and after that rolled with the palm of the hand on a mat in order to fold them Public laboratories are built for the purpose All the processes are given at large by  Kaempfer  See also Staunton's Embassy to  China  vol ii p    TEA is in as universal use in  Japan  as in  China  and taken two ways The most common is similar to the  European  or rather the mode we learned from the  Orientalists  but the manner of taking it is attended with the utmost ceremony The art is called  Sado  and  Tsianoi  We have our dancingmasters c and in my time M  Vestris  gave lectures to our quality on the manner of eating gracefully their soup The  Japanese  masters are to instruct in the manner of behavior at tea how they are to make it and how they are to present it in a polite manner  THE qualities of tea are as much disputed in  Japan  as they are in  Europe  but such is the charming infatuation that the use is still followed in defiance of those who take the side of depretiation in the old controversy  Kaempfer  gives us an excellent figure of the plant in vol ii tab and of the process of  the

obliged to my friend the reverend Mr  Dickinson  for the following curious account of the  Arundo Bambos  "which" says he  grows in the woods and mountains of  Japan  and produces many varieties differing much in habit and distinguished by different names Yet amidst all this variety  Thunberg  observes that he never had the satisfaction of meeting with a single plant of it in the flowering state This is not to be wondered at when we are informed by  Reede  Mal v i p that it does not flower till it has attained the age of about sixty years and what is very remarkable sheds its leaves a month previous to the time of flowering and immediately after having perfected its fruit withers and dies  The small slender walking canes so much admired for their elegant rings are obtained from young irregular suckers or shoots of the bambo which spring from the root after the main stem has been repeatedly cut down Nature has not formed them precisely of the figure in which we receive them They are originally crooked and pliant and much art is used by suspended weights attached to them and the application of smoke to render them strait and stiff It is farther necessary to retrench with a knife the fibres which adhere to the rings and were intended by nature to propagate the plant in the same manner as the  Triticum repens  couch grass multiplies its offsets by shoots from the joints  This species of walking stick is distinguished from the  Rotang  or true cane not only by its singular protuberances but also by a small perforation extending through the center  of the whole length of it which is common to all  Bambus  and in their mature state enlarges into spacious cavities rendering this inestimable vegetable subservient to a thousand useful domestic purposes It is only in the island of  Japan  that the  Bambu  is thus artificially prepared for the purpose of a walking cane and constituting a lucrative article of commerce it is counterfeited at  Surat  upon the  Malabar  coast and a spurious sort made of a different wood imposed upon the ignorant The name of  Bambu  is not  Indian  but was given to this plant by  Europeans  as expressive of the violent explosion that comes upon committing its branches to the flames the report of which is said to equal that of the firing of guns and is caused by the rarefaction of great quantities of air which had been imprisoned

them one in the other in but both were fruitless They are said to lie to the E N E of the coasts of  Japan  a hundred and fifty miles distant All that I can find is that they are both put down in Mr  Arrowsmith  's map one in about Lat ° north under the name of  Rica di oro  or the  gold  island and the other  Rica di plata  or the  silver  still farther north Mr  Arrowsmith  supposes it to be

cast of  Greenwich  The waves broke against its rugged front with a fury proportioned to the immense distance they had to roll before they were interrupted by it It rose almost perpendicular to the height according to the tables of near three hundred and fifty feet A small black rock appeared just above the water at about forty or fifty yards from the western edge There was a cavern on  its south eastern side into which the waters rolled with an awful and tremendous noise In regarding this stupendous rock which stood alone in an immense ocean we could not but consider it as an object

of the place  It is says he not above a hundred years since they first ventured thither It was thought before that time to be wholly inaccessible and by reason of the thick  smoke which was observed continually to arise from it and of the several spectres and other frightful uncommon apparitions people fancied to see there in the night it was believed to be a dwellingplace of devils till at last a resolute and courageous man offered himself and obtained leave accordingly to go and examine the state and situation of it He chose fifty resolute fellows for this expedition who upon going on shore found neither hell nor devils but a large flat spot of ground at the top which was so thoroughly covered with sulphur that wherever they walked a thick smoke issued from under their feet Ever since that time this island brings in to the prince of  Satzuma  about chests of silver  per annum  arising only from the sulphur dug up there besides what he gets by the trees and timber growing along the shore  VULCANOES are to be found in many parts of the empire  VULCANOES  which in general abounds with their great  pabulum sulphur  and metallic bodies Some have burnt incessantly for ages others have ceased or only emit flames periodically The most noted is the mountain  Fesi  in the province of  Surugu  equal in height to the pike of  Teneriff  and capt with everlasting snow  No country is

the largest  Nipon  which gives name to the whole is of a curvated form and approximates at the southern end to the southwestern extremity of  Korea  Between both are the streights of  Korea  and within is the great gulph of the same name bounded on the eastern side by the concavity of  Nipon  According to M  D'Anvilles  scale that island is above six hundred miles in length  THE next island is that of  Sikokf  or the country of  four  SIKOKF  because divided into four provinces It is irregular in its form and lodged between two large projections of  Nipon  its length is two hundred miles  BETWEEN its eastern end and the west of the salient part of  Nipon  AWAD  is a smaller island named  Awad  THE third or more southerly island is separated from the western part of  Sikokf  by a narrow strait and is named  Saikokf  SAIKOKF OR KIUSIU  or the western country and  Kiusiu  or the country of  nine  because divided into nine provinces  AROUND most of these greater islands are innumerable small ones inhabited or uninhabited among them  Firando  and  Gesima  are the most celebrated as having been the seat of  European  factories and distinguished in history  THE  Japanese  islands were certainly visited  VISITED BY MARCO POLO  in the thirteenth century by the famous  Marco Polo  He describes the riches of the country in high terms and says that the emperor's palace was covered with plates of gold and that the seas abounded with fine pearls of a red cast He adds that the inhabitants were idolaters and worshipped monstrous images with the heads of beasts and with many hands and that if they took any foreigner who was able to ransom himself they let him go otherwise they killed him and with their friends made a feast on his body  Marco Polo  Travels p  gives a long account of the imprudent invasion of this island by the great  Tartarian  emperor  Kublai Khan  the  Siu Tsu  of the  Chinese  Du Halde i  about the year who sent there his general  Argas  with a most numerous army and vast fleet The greater part of his ships perished in a tempest and all the men who escaped to shore were massacred by the  Japanese  so that very few returned to give any account of the misfortune The  Chinese  never more attempted the empire of  Japan  THAT country cannot properly be said to have been discovered by the  Europeans  till the year  DISCOVERED BY THE PORTUGUESE  by three  Portuguese  named  de Mota Zeimoto  and  Peixolo  these as I have before mentioned in common with the rest of their countrymen instigated by avarice had sailed from  Malacca  in search of an imaginary spot called the  island of gold  Driven by a hurricane they were wrecked on the shores of  Japan  The lord of the district received  them with great humanity and signified an earnest desire of entering into a commerce with a nation which he flattered himself would be so advantageous to him and his subjects  IT was at this period that  Francis de Xavier  FRANCIS DE XAVIER  the great apostle of the  Indies  was deeply engaged in his mission in the peninsula of  Malacca  His fame had reached  Japan  when a native of the country determined to make a visit to that part of  India  to be satisfied of the truth of the wonders reported to have been wrought by  de Xavier  He came attended by two servants was converted to Christianity and adopted the name of  Paul  of the  Holy Faith  so zealous was he in his new religion that he may truly be called the  Apostle  of  Japan De Xavier  determined to attend him to his native country He associated with him two Jesuits sailed and landed in at  Kangoxima  in the kingdom of  Satzuma  on the southern part of the island of  Kiusiu  and soon after passed to  Firando  a small island where he assisted by  Paul  made converts innumerable  INTRODUCES CHRISTIANITY  His zeal then determined him to visit the emperor at the royal city of  Miaco  he arrived at the court and was received with much respect The multitude of proselytes was incredible The benevolence and humanity of our religion were the principal instruments with which the missionaries operated on the minds of the people who compared the conduct of the Christian preachers with that of their own  Bonzees  The last suppose that all sick and infirm people are the objects of the wrath of Heaven and constantly leave them to perish The missionaries observed the precepts of our Saviour they fed the hungry cloathed the naked and administered to the sick These irresistible proofs of the superior  excellency of our doctrine gave success to their labours for near a century the true religion flourished and spread more and more over the empire Other circumstances concurred to facilitate the reception of the gospel in  Japan  The  Bonzees  preached the necessity of mediators in their  Xaca  and other gods they underwent long and severe fasts and mortifications and both Christians and  Japanese  agreed in the worshipping of images in the monastic life in beads processions praying for the dead and even auricular confession  The  Jesuits  were followed  JESUITS c  as occurred in  China  by crowds of  Dominicans Franciscans  and  Augustlines  to assist in the harvest The holy men soon fell into the same error as in that empire they quickly began to quarrel with the Jesuits accused them of avarice and of temporizing with the vices and superstitions of the  Japanese  Let the reader peruse p of this volume and he will learn the imprudency of all these religious adventurers  THE vast profits resulting from the commercial and worldly spirit of the Jesuits were one cause of the toleration which the Christian religion experienced for so great a length of time The emperors saw the wealth the  Europeans  brought into their country and as long as the Christians did not disturb the peace of the government they permitted the conversion of their subjects and the exercise of our religion The  Portuguese  settled at first at the harbors of  Bungo  and  Firando  and afterwards at  Nagasaki  only They carried on immense trade and in one year exported not less than three hundred tons of gold from  Miaco  the emporium at that time of all their commerce in this part of the world In the year when their trade was on  the decline they even sent from that town chests of silver  The  Dutch  introduced themselves into  Japan  about the year established their first factory at  Firando  and obtained from the emperor a patent for a free commerce The deep enmity between them and the  Portuguese  soon began to shew itself and each nation took every possible means to supplant its rival In the year an opportunity offered  CONSPIRACY  The  Dutch  happened to take a  Portuguese  ship in which were found certain letters from a captain  Moro  to the  Portuguese  ministry at  Lisbon  wherein he had laid a plan for murdering the emperor and reducing the empire to the power of his countrymen  Moro  was a  Japanese  by birth chief of the  Portuguese  in  Japan  and very zealous for the Christian religion The letters were carefully transmitted to the emperor  Moro  was empaled and burnt alive After a little time an edict followed which entirely banished every foreigner from the empire with the most rigid prohibition of their ever entering it again A persecution was raised against the Christians  PERSECUTION  perhaps the most horrid that ever was known it lasted forty years and thousands perished by the most dreadful torments it was computed that above a third of the people of the empire were professors of Christianity The punishments those miserable creatures underwent are not to be related the inventions of Hell itself must have been put to the stretch If any one has the strange curiosity of being acquainted with them he need only turn to  Ogilvy  's History of  Japan  P  which he will probably shut with the same horror as I did Let me only add that the  boiling water mentioned by me at p of this work was one of the instruments of torture varied and lengthened by the most diabolical inventions Those of  Singok  were the most horrible they flow with vast violence and noise beneath a lofty precipice and emit the most noisome sulphureous vapor which rises to a great height Hither the Christians were brought in multitudes and in case they refused to renounce their religion were carried bound to the summit of the mountain and precipitated into the subjacent  Phlegethon  IN order to impress on every subject a detestation of the  Christian  religion  TREADING ON THE CRUCIFIX  and possibly to discover if there be any latent favorers of its doctrine the following annual custom is preserved throughout the empire people of all ranks and periods of life even to children of a certain age are assembled in the different places where they perform the ceremony of trampling upon the cross It was even said to have been a rite exacted from the  Dutch  as the price of their commerce with the  Japanese Swift  in his voyage to  Laputa  is humorous on the subject for when  Gulliver  under the character of a  Dutchman  petitions the emperor to be excused the ceremony his majesty much surprised tells him that he was the first of his countrymen who ever made any scruple and that he suspected he must be a Christian and not a  Hollander  DUTCH  In the  Dutch  sent a solemn embassy to the emperor then resident at  Miaco  and were said to have at that time obtained an advantageous commercial treaty at length they fell under the general edict of expulsion yet even after that severe decree procured readmission under most mortifying restrictions they virtually are compelled to renounce their  religion they must give up their prayerbooks on first landing and relinquish during their whole confinement every mark of Christianity But what will not a  Dutchman  do for gain They make from the factory an annual journey to the emperor's court which they dignify with the name of embassy but it is no more than a compulsory visit to present their gifts their manner of travelling both on their way and on their return is under a strict guard more like that of a parcel of convicts than the merchants of a great commercial nation One ship only is permitted to trade with this empire annually and that is confined to the port of  Nagasaki  in the little isle of  Desima  on the west side of the island  Kiusiu  In fact this is the only secure harbor in all the mighty empire of  Japan  As soon as a vessel arrives a  Japanese  guard is put on board the number size age and complexion of the crew noted down every living creature in the vessel is to be accounted for a monkey died and the coroner's inquest sat on the body The next thing done is to take an exact inventory of and to cause all the sails masts ropes rudder guns arms ammunition c and all the tackle of the ships to be conveyed into the emperor's warehouse there to be kept under lock and seal till the time comes for their departure when they are restored according to the inventory taken of which both parties have an exact duplicate  Some of these precautions  Thunberg  says are now omitted E    THE factory is imprisoned in the little island the whole year  FACTORY  excepting during the six weeks of open trade when the  Japanese  come there with their goods erect booths and have all  sorts of amusements  SMUGGLING  Smuggling even of the most trifling articles is forbidden under pain of death  Kaempfer  History of  Japan  i  assures us that three hundred were executed for that crime only in six or seven years time two were put to death while he was in the island and the factory obliged to attend their crime was no more than smuggling one pound of camplior  THE articles imported by the  Dutch  TRADE IMPORTS  are raw silk from  China Tonquin Bengal  and  Persia  and from the same countries all kinds of stuffs silks and woollens provided they are not wrought with gold or silver various sorts of the cotton manufactures of  India  but not painted woollen cloths stuffs and serges from  Europe  buffalo and deer hides from  Siam  and  Cambodia  tanned hides from  Persia  and  Bengal  pepper sugar cloves and nutmegs from  India  or the spicy isles  gumlac  sandalwood camphor from  Borneo Catechu Storax Liquida  saffron and  Costus  coral cinnabar antimony lead saltpetre and borax looking glasses which the  Japanese  break to make spying glasses magnifiers c files needles and various sorts of iron ware from  Europe  large drinking glasses spectacles toys curiosities natural and artificial and strange birds of all kinds Once the  Dutch  brought a  Cassowary  it was considered as a bird of ill omen and the owner was obliged to send it back  IN return the  Dutch  obtain  EXPORTS  during the six weeks fair gold silver and copper bullion japanned cabinet and other works porcelain tea and  Japanese  camphor and also copper in bars and other forms These constitute the sum of the traffic which on the whole is far from considerable ever since the abolition of  Christianity in the empire The  Abbe Raynal  estimates the whole annual commerce at little more than fortyfive thousand pounds  THE first time that the  English  traded directly with  Japan  ENGLISH  was in when captain  Saris  entered the port of  Firando  he met with the most courteous reception from the king of the island  Saris  was charged with letters and presents from our commercial pacific monarch  James  I to his imperial majesty of  Japan  After a short stay at  Firando  he proceeded on his journey to  Surunga  where the emperor at that time kept his court A most honorable answer was returned and privilege of trade granted to the  English  throughout the  Japanese  empire  Saris  then made a visit to the emperor's son at  Jedo  The history of these transactions is given by  Purchas  Pilgrim vol i p  and is well worth consulting  Saris  found at  Firando William Adams  an  Englishman  who by a strange chance was flung on this island and detained there  Ibid p  till his death He was of no small use to  Saris  as an interpreter  Saris  established a factory at  Firando  till the general expulsion of the  Europeans  the  Dutch  excepted  THE  French  in the time of  Colbert  FRENCH  were desirous of partaking of the advantages of the  Japanese  trade that great minister proposed sending a number of  Huguenots  who might safely swear that they were not of the same religion with the  Portuguese  but the jealous  Japanese  rejected the request  THE  Chinese  had once prodigious commerce in this empire  CHINESE  and came and settled in any numbers they pleased but in time  the jealous  Japanese  took umbrage at the vast concourse of those foreigners and at length confined them to a certain precinct near the same island with the  Dutch  They are allowed to have three sales in the year one in spring when they are permitted to dispose of the cargoes of twenty jonks a second of thirty jonks and a third in autumn of twenty All above the number are obliged to return without being suffered to unlade  THE religion of the  Japanese  is idolatry  THEIR DEITIES  their deities are amazingly numerous tradition says that they had been men eminent for their piety or mortification deified after death for their several virtues They also hold that their earliest emperors were gods and demigods and that during the first period they were governed by seven great celestial spirits each of which reigned a certain but immense number of years Their temples are very numerous dispersed not only over the cities but even the mountains and deserts Their idols assume a thousand extravagant forms and colossal sizes in one of their temples is an idol of copper gilt the very chair it sits on is seventy feet high and the head so large as to be capable of containing fifteen men many of them work miracles and bring abundance of gain to the temple or monastery which possesses such a treasure  A TEMPLE near  Miaco  takes its name from its number of idols which amount to Doctor  Kaempfer  gives us a view  History of  Japan  vol ii tab  of this vast repository and in the following plate represents its celebrated idol  Quenwoa  sitting on the flower  Tarate  THE monastic life is much in vogue in  Japan  MONASTIC LIFE  The monasteries are filled with regulars and seculars like those of the  church of  Rome  some lead most austere lives others indulge like the plump  Benedictines  others are accused of great irregularities  THERE is one order of singular austerity that of the  Jammabos  i e the  mountain soldiers  they in one sense answer to our military religious being bound to fight for the gods and religion of their country but never have degenerated into the voluptuousness of the knights of the  European  orders They pass their time amidst the holy mountains and practise the greatest mortifications the richer live more at their ease in their own houses This order is now divided into two sects one called  Jofanfa  the votaries of which bind themselves to ascend once a year the great mountain of  Fikoasan  a journey of vast difficulty by reason of its heights and dreadful precipices but still more tremendous on account of the penalty attending any impure person making the attempt he infallibly is possessed by the devil of the mountain and becomes stark mad The other sect is named  Fonsansa  this likewise is obliged to make an annual pilgrimage to the summit of the  Omine  a mountain not less terrible than the other but should any one presume to ascend it without being duly prepared by purification he is certain of being flung down the precipices or seized with a lingering illness the penalties of his neglect  THE  Japanese  religion is split into a multitude of sects  VARIOUS SECTS  each differ in some tenets yet all agree in five indispensible commandments They are not to kill or eat of any thing that is killed they are not to steal nor to lie nor to commit adultery nor to drink wine Is it not evident that they brought with them on the dispersion of mankind some of  the Mosaical laws and in the last that they had adopted the rite of the  Rechabites  Japan  has its peculiar language  LANGUAGE  different from all the  Asiatic  and probably the primitive one brought over by the colonists who originally peopled the islands and came directly from the banks of the  Euphrates  on the dispersion of mankind after the confusion of languages The  Japanese  have an opinion that the primoeval emigrants settled in the province of  Isje  numbers therefore make a pilgrimage annually to the antient spot the place where their ancestors dwelt and as such honor it with peculiar acts of devotion At  Isje  are two temples  Kaempfer  i tab  within that which they name the  True Temple  nothing is to be seen but a looking glass and bits of white paper emblems of truth and purity They probably brought with them a pure Monotheism which was afterwards converted into Polytheism by their intermixing with the several nations which subsequently contributed to the population of  Japan  because it is reasonably believed that empire received a vast increase of inhabitants by the numerous shipwrecks on its stormy coasts and likewise by migrations from the neighboring  China  and  Korea  Whether the vast reverence which the  Japanese  pay to their parents was copied from the  Chinese  or whether it might not have been introduced by the primoeval colonists as a part of the first great code of laws the fifth commandment I will not pretend to determine  Japan  is governed by two emperors  GOVERNMENT SECULAR  one called the  Cubo  or secular monarch who rules with absolute power all the princes and great lords of the empire pay him the most servile obedience  Formerly the whole was divided into small independent states the rulers were stiled kings and princes many of which retain the names and govern absolute enough but entirely under the direction of the emperor  THE antient title of the monarch was  Dairo  he was also sovereign pontiff and like the pope the supreme head of the church In that character his person was held so sacred that little short of divine worship was paid to him for a long period he governed by means of a prime minister who was called the  Cubo  a dignity usually bestowed on one of his younger sons the father like other eastern monarchs devoting his whole time to indolence and sensuality At length a  Cubo  arose who dethroned the  Dairo  or rather usurped his more important office that of secular emperor he permitted him to retain that of pontiff  ECCLESIASTICAL  The  Cubo  thus stripped him of all sort of power except ecclesiastical but preserves the farce of paying him all external respect as much as if he had enjoyed the antient plenitude of authority he renders him an imaginary homage and pretends to act only as his deputy and to hold the empire from him  THE  Dairo  was permitted to reside in the palace in the old imperial city of  Miaco  and to keep up the antient state but that is now done with difficulty as the  Cubos  have successively lessened the revenues Still he reigns supreme over the church The people pay him the utmost veneration and the  Cubo  himself is obliged to marry one of his daughters in case he has any that are marriageable The first  Cubo  who usurped the empire retired to  Jedo  which is the other great capital of the island  THE laws of  Japan  as is told of those of  Draco  SEVERE LAWS  may be said  to have been written in blood  Montesquieu  observes that it is to supply the great defect of the religion of the country in its ignorance of the doctrine of future rewards and punishment Almost every crime is punished with death  AND PUNISHMENTS  and often attended with the most excruciating torments Crucifixion is very common sometimes the malefactor is crucified erect sometimes with the head down I have little doubt but that these punishments were unknown in the empire till the propagation of Christianity The ideas were taken from the crucifixes of the Christians and from the pictures of the suffering of our SAVIOR The mode in which death was inflicted on the apostle St  Peter  probably gave rise to that variation of cruelty in  Japan  THE punishment for gentlemen and soldiers is ripping open the belly As a peculiar favor they are sometimes permitted to be their own executioners The emperor sends his mandate the person whom he so favors receives it with the utmost respect makes a great feast and on the conclusion puts the imperial order in execution in the very presence of his friends and family  FROM the variety of feature and form of body in the  Japanese  of the several provinces it is evident they are descended from different races of people who have migrated or have been cast on the coasts at various times "Thus" says  Kaempfer  i  although the  Japanese  in the main particularly the common people of  Nipon  be of a very ugly appearance shortsized strong thicklegged tawny with flattish noses and thick eyelids though the eyes stand not so deep in the forehead as in  the  Chinese  yet the descendants of the eldest and noblest families of the princes and lords of the empire have somewhat more majestick in their shape and countenance being more like the  Europeans  The inhabitants of the provinces  Satzuma Oosijma  and  Fiuga  are of a middle size strong courageous and manly otherwise civil and polite The same is observed of the inhabitants of some of the northern provinces in the great island  Nipon  excepting those of the great province  Osju  who are said to be beyond others cruel and unmerciful The inhabitants of some provinces of  Saikokf  particularly of  Fisen  are short slender but wellshaped of a good handsome appearance and extremely polite The inhabitants of the great island  Nipon  particularly of its eastern provinces are known from others by their big heads flat noses and musculous fleshy complexion  Kaempfer  Hist of  Japan  i  relates  ISLE OF BLACKS  that some centuries ago the  Japanese  discovered the island of  Genkaisima  situate to the north of  Nipon  and inhabited by  Owi  or  black devils  and that after extirpating them they peopled the isle with a colony of their own These blacks are described in the antient chronicles of  Japan  to have worn long hair spread over their shoulders and to have had strange household goods and highcrowned hats  Kaempfer  justly imagines them to have been  Malayes  wrecked on that island Those people are remarkable for wearing their hair of a great length and as to the hats they most probably were  European  and among the articles imported into the  Malaye  islands which in old times were brought over land to  Ormuz  and from  thence dispersed by sea to the peninsula of  Malacca Siam  and other places  NOTWITHSTANDING the  Japanese  have for ages scarcely known the pest of war  MANNERS  yet they are endowed with the greatest heroism If in any quarrel they have been conquered by an enemy and find they cannot revenge the insult they will put themselves to death I speak of this not in praise but to describe a high spirit bordering on brutality That spirit exerted in a foreign land against the treachery of  Peter Nuyts  the  Dutch  governor merits our admiration and applause  Univ Hist vol x p  Kaempfer  's  Japan  vol ii app  To fill the catalogue of their vices they are distrustful proud cruel and destitute of benevolence and from the doctrine of their  Bonzees  are so insensible to the wants of their fellowcreatures as to suffer them to perish by denying them every sort of relief To their intrepidity may be added their patience under labor their ability to undergo any hardships Their other virtues are numerous they have great industry great moderation in their pleasures are entirely free from luxury and intemperance moderate in their desires of wealth just in their dealings and true to their word chaste in word and action religious but apt to deviate into the grossest superstitions  THEY are celebrated for the quickness of their apprehensions and facility in learning Before the arrival of the missionaries their acquired knowledge was at a low ebb What they attained after that period may possibly be lost At that time they were very ignorant astronomers  ASTROLOGY  but much addicted to judicial astrology they undertake nothing without consulting some pretending  impostor  GEOGRAPHY  As to geography they made the world consist of three parts  China Siam  and  Japan  We may see by their maps their extent in that branch of science we have one as a proof in the  British Museum  THEIR skill in physic is not less moderate  PHYSIC  their great art is that of the pulse The physicians first feel one arm and then another as if the impulse did not come from the same machine the heart Their  Aesculapius  or  Apollo  is the god  Jakusi  They have very few remedies two form the principal the one is the  Acupunctura  or pricking with the needle  ACUPUNCTURA  in use for a dreadful species of colic common in  Japan  The professors in the art make use of certain needles and form with much ceremony and superstition the punctures in three rows  Kaempfer ii App p tab  But this operation is applied for the cure of other disorders  A singular coincidence with the Chinesepractice mentioned by Dr Gillan Embassy vol ii p E    THE other great remedy is the  Moxa  MOXA  a caustic applied in almost every distemper It is made of the leaves of the  Artemisia vulgaris  and being set on fire is placed on the part affected The flame is not visible nor is the burning attended with any considerable pain The astrologers are consulted on the occasion who have figures of the human body drawn like the man in the almanack with all its parts marked to which the  Moxa  is to be applied  Kaempfer ii tab  for the physicians seem to act with peculiar reverence to the influence of the stars  THIS remedy is also in use in  India  and other countries in  Asia  It has even been introduced into  Europe  as a cure for the  gout but I believe with such little success that the practice has long since been exploded  THE  Japanese  have another medicine  A FAMOUS POWDER  a powder to be taken internally in colicky diseases The inventor had the art to give out that it was communicated to him in a dream by  Jakusi  the god of physic which stamped such a veneration for this medicine that he enriched himself so greatly as to build a temple with part of his gains and the family who keep the  nostrum  to themselves have erected two or three more the chief ingredient is supposed to be the  China  root great quantities of which and also of the  Ginseng  root is imported into  Japan  for medical purposes  BOTANY is much studied by the physicians of the empire and many books are composed on the subject Dr  Thunberg  met with two physicians at  Jedo  who had great knowledge not only in their own profession but in botany mineralogy and zoology  THE famous  Terra Japonica  or  Catechu  is prepared chiefly at  Odowara  CATECHU  the principal ingredient is foreign being an extract from the  Mimosa Catechu  Woodville's Med Bot vol ii p tab  a small tree which grows in great plenty on the mountains of  Hindoostan  not the  Areca catechu  as had been long supposed we were first favored with this discovery by Mr  Ker  assistant surgeon in  Bengal  Much is manufactured in the province of  Bahar  an ointment is composed from it of general repute throughout  India  being found a most useful astringent in that hot climate It has for a great length of time kept its place in our dispensatory as an efficacious medicine in weakness of the bowels in general and the consequential  fluxes It has also been used with much success as an antiseptic in cases of a putrid dissolved state of the blood by the great physicians  Huxham  and  Pringle  In  Japan  it is sold perfumed and made up in various forms for the use chiefly of the ladies who hold it in great esteem to fasten their teeth and give a sweetness to their breath  THE  Japanese  are fond of good paintings  PAINTINGS  and the rich will give immense prices for pieces of merit As to their own artists they are on a level with those of the  Chinese  but excel us greatly in the beauty of their colors  THEIR cabinetworks  JAPAN WORKS  and the several things which go under the common name of  Japan  are well known for the excellency of the varnish which surpasses that of all the world The black also is most intense and the coloring or painting exquisite as to the brass furniture of the cabinets it is very coarse and clumsy But the  Japanese  excel in iron manufactures  STEEL  their metal is of the best quality their arms are muskets bows and arrows daggers and scymitars The last of a most remarkable temper it is customary to try the edge on the bodies of executed malefactors which they cut to pieces by way of experiment  WHEN I am on the subject of arms  ARMY  I may mention the military of the empire It is computed that the standing army consists of a hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse In a kingdom which can have no foreign wars nor fears intestine tumults this is surprising but since the conspiracy of the  Portuguese  and the extirpation of Christianity the emperors have been in constant fears of plots and invasions from the  European  powers  LET me now return to the arts  PRINTING  Printing has been among them from time immemorial like the  Chinese  they cut the letters on blocks of wood but excel them in neatness they print and write like that nation In this art and in several others as well as in customs there is such an agreement that I cannot doubt but that the  Chinese  were their original instructors in science but as is often the case the scholar has excelled the master  THEY also claim the invention of gunpowder  GUNPOWDER  but remain inferior to the  Chinese  in its uses not only in artillery but in all species of fireworks  THE architecture of the  Japanese  resembles in some degree that of the  Chinese  ARCHITECTURE  it is much more plain being not loaden with ornaments as that of  China  The common houses are small consisting of two stories the upper of which is seldom inhabited and the rest is almost destitute of furniture except mats and a small table to eat on The cedar  Juniperus virginiana  fir and the bamboo are the great materials for building Their mirrors are made of metal but never used but at their toilets The windows are covered with a white paper thin enough to admit the light  THE castles of the nobility consist of three different inclosures  CASTLES  one round the other and are defended by a deep ditch but never by artillery they are usually at the skirts of large towns the owners are bound to keep them in repair  THE temples are often very magnificent  TEMPLES  and some are peculiarly remarkable for the height of the roof the elegance of the sculpture and beauty of the gilding and painting  HERE are considerable manufactures of silk and cotton  SILK AND COTTON  the produce of their own country but the  Dutch  are allowed to import a great quantity of cloths stuffs chintzes and cottons  THE dress of the better sort of people are silk of the lower  HABITS  cotton Their habits are loose gowns with large sleeves In summer they are thin in winter quilted and often they put on one or more additional according to the severity of the season The women's apparel resembles the men's only the gowns of the former are much longer and trail on the ground men of rank also wear trowsers and short black jackets placed over their gowns They use sandals but do not wear stockings and always go bareheaded except in a journey when they put on a conical cap of straw at other times they protect themselves from the sun and rain by fans and umbrellas  THE manufacture of porcelain is of great antiquity  PORCELAIN  I CONCLUDE the account of  Japan  with a very brief mention of the two capitals of which  Miaco  is the most antient  MIACO  and the original seat of empire The plan is given by  Kaempfer  Hist of Japan vol ii tab  copied from the original now deposited in the  British Museum  by which it appears most regularly built the streets crossing each other at right angles It lies in about Lat ° ′ north in a large plain surrounded with beautiful verdant hills and mountains and watered by numbers of small streams  Miaco  is the residence of the  Dairo  or ecclesiastical emperor and is full of manufactures of all kinds being the chief mercantile town in the empire Here the richest stuffs with gold and silver flowers are woven copper smelted and among the most trifling matters are made the puppets with moving heads  THE number of inhabitants in  Kaempser  's time was of which were ecclesiastics  VARIOUS streams unite and form a river which flows from hence to the great commercial city and port of  Osacca  on a fine bay which last is said to be so populous that in case of need it could send forth an army of eighty thousand men  DOCTOR  Kaempfer  gives  Hist of Japan vol ii p tab  a very good idea of the beauty and singularity of some of the coasts between  Miaco  and  Osacca  in his views of  Simoasi Morizu  and  Muru  with the semicircular hills with which those places are backed most characteristically cultivated to the very tops  Jedo  JEDO  the residence of the temporal and in fact the real emperor is built with far less regularity  Ibid vol ii tab  because built by degrees and on no certain plan It stands in Lat ° ′ north The palace is very large and covers a vast extent of ground The city has great numbers of temples dedicated to  Amida  and the various deities the ecclesiastics are of course prodigiously numerous The houses are in general small and mean and liable to frequent fires four thousand have been burnt by a single accident A large river runs through the city and falls into the harbor one branch encompasses the castle and divided into five streams unites with the other in the port  THE naval force of the  Japanese  is very small  NAVY  the emperors not having thought proper to maintain a fleet since the expulsion of foreigners presuming it impossible to have quarrels with nations with whom they could have no intercourse  SHIPPING  The merchant ships which are built only for conveying goods from island to island are most clumsily made and by the emperor's order in  such a form as renders it impossible for them to go far to sea They are commonly about twentyeight yards long and eight broad The stern is square with a hole left in the middle expressly to increase the danger of distant navigation both stern and prow are very lofty The ships have only one mast and are constructed for rowing as well as failing The figures in  Kaempfer  Kaempfer Hist of Japan vol ii tab  will give the best notion of their form  Korea  and certain other territories  KOREA  have been long tributary to the  Japanese  empire The neighboring  Korea  shall be first mentioned I refer the reader to a future volume for farther particulars of that country Here I shall briefly add its history as far as concerns the  Japanese  It had been conquered first by  Mikaddo Tsiuu Ai  emperor of  Japan  and after that  Anno Christi  by his relict  Dsin Ju  a princess celebrated for her abilities and valor The  Koreans  in time shook off the  Japanese  yoke and continued independent till  Taiko  having usurped the secular empire in order to free himself from such of the nobility who were disaffected to his government and under pretence of reducing the  Koreans  sent them at the head of a potent army they landed on the continent obliged the  Koreans  but not without the bravest resistance to become once more tributary to the empire  Taiko  died the affairs of  Korea  were neglected and the  Japanese  driven down to the coasts and of all their conquests left only in possession of the maritime parts of the province of  Tsiosijn  and two islands one called  Iku  the other  Tsussima  on which is kept a garrison of fifty men but these islands are neither remarkable for their size or their fertility  THE articles brought from thence are cod  PRODUCE  and other fish pickled walnuts rare medicinal plants and flowers and the famous  Gingseng  roots and before the imperial prohibition certain earthen pots made in the  Tartarian  provinces of  Japii  and  Niuke  THE other country dependent on  Japan  ISLE OF MATMAY  is the island of  Matmay  or  Matsumai  part of the land of  Jeso  divided from the north end of  Nipon  by an incurvated streight in the nearest place sixty  versts  or fortyfive miles broad According to  Charlevoix  in his  Fastes Chronologiques  the first  European  who visited that island was father  Jerom de Angelis  a  Sicilian  jesuit who went there by sea from  Japan  and landed at the capital He reached it in the year and returned in but without being certain whether it was an island or part of the continent nor has he left us any account either of it or its inhabitants  THE next  Europeans  who visited this country were the  Dutch  LAND OF JESO  who in sailed from the  Cape Nabo  in the ships  Castricom  captain  De Vries  and the  Breskes  on a voyage of discovery off the coasts of  Tartary  In Lat ° ′ north they fell in with what they call  Eso  or  Jeso  Whether this was the north extremity of  Matsumai  or another land almost contiguous to it does not appear By Mr  Arrowsmith  's map it should seem that these discoverers sailed along the eastern coast of a certain country from the most southern part of  Matsumai  as high as Lat ° ′ and gave names to several bays or points of lands As to the western sides of the region they probably are quite undiscovered In the map I am so partial to not only that coast but those of the corresponding continent are left undetermined  noted only with dotted lines even as high as the south end of the island of  Sachalin  The intermediate space is the supposed streight of  Jeso  Whether the land of  Jeso  is as Mr  Müller  conjectures any more than an archipelago or whether it is part of the  Tartarian  continent at present remains extremely doubtful  Matsumai  alone seems to have been proved to be an island  The voyage of the unfortunate  de la Perouse  has thrown considerable light on the hitherto undescribed land of  Jeso  and the opposite shore of  Tartary  After coasting for some time the inhospitable isles of  Japan  that able navigator traversed the intervening sea till he came in sight of the continent of  Asia  in Lat ° which he followed in a northerly direction and in Lat ° ′ landed at the  Baie de Ternai  Here he found a country of the most abundant vegetation but shewing no signs of being occupied except by wandering hunters or occasional visitants by sea Game of all kinds were seen in quantities and the sea afforded a copious supply of cod herring and falmon In an excursion inland some of the party discovered a tomb in which were deposited two bodies clad in the skin of bears  Chinese  coin and copper ornaments were attached to their girdles and near them lay silver earings an iron hatchet a knife a wooden spoon a comb and a small bag of rice  Still pursuing the coasts of  Chinese Tartary  the navigators touched at a bay to which they gave the name of  Suffrein  situated in Lat ° ′ continual fogs retarded their progress In Lat ° ′ they discovered to the east the apparently rocky and barren shores of the nominal land of  Jeso  part of the vast island  Tehoka  or  Sachalin  to which they sailed They found the inhabitants advanced to a considerable degree of civilization in consequence of their intercourse with the  Chinese  parts of whose dress they had adopted and with whom and the  Mantchew Tartars  they carried on a trade in dried fish and oil Leaving these intelligent islanders who had traced on the sand with almost geographical accuracy the object of his farther enquiry  de la Perouse  proceeded northwards and touched at a spot he denominated  Baie d'Estaing  the channel between  Tehoka  and the continent narrowed to the distance of twelve leagues the soundings also became gradually less and in Lat ° ′ did not exceed nine fathoms The enterprizing spirit of a  Cook  or a  Vancouver  seemed here wanting  de la Perouse  after a trial of a few hours remained satisfied that a bank of sand over which boats only could pass connected the shores and closed the extremity of the vast gulf He however draws the just conclusion that the island called  Sachalin  by the  Russians  the northern extremity of which has long been known extends from the th to the th degrees of latitude and consequently includes a portion of the  Yedzo  or  Jeso  of our geographers The straights which separate this island from that of  Matsumay  are ascertained with accuracy and justly distinguished by the name of the French navigatorOn the return of the ships from their fruitless attempt to penetrate into the sea of  Ochotsk  they entered the  Baie de Castries  on the coast of  Tartary  Here was situated a small village inhabited by a race whose high cheek bones and small eyes announced its origin but it appeared only the occasional residence of different tribes for the purpose of fishing who carry the produce of their labor to the  Mantchew Tartars  living on the banks of the great river  Segalien  or  Amur  from whom they receive in exchange for their dried salmon grain nanquin and other articles probably brought from  China  The custom of leaving in their huts during the long season of absence for the purposes of commerce their bows arrows nets and such furniture as their few wants require constitutes an interesting proof of the honesty of this harmless race of people in several particulars they agree with the natives of  Kamchatka  and tombs far exceeding the proportion of the apparent population excited similar astonishment and gives the same cause for investigation as the numerous memorials of the dead on the coast of  America  observed by  Vancouver  De la Perouse  after doubling  Cape Crillon  the southern extremity of the island  Sachalin  in Lat ° ′ landed in a secure bay inhabited by a tribe of a darker complexion than those of the north and more industrious their utensils and dress shewed their intercourse with the  Japanese  The distance from hence to the northern shores of the isle of  Matsamay  does not exceed twelve leagues The navigators here fell into the track and had the opportunity of rendering justice to the veracity of the Dutch voyagers in E  That all the tract which the  Dutch  saw to the west is that land of  Jeso  there can be no dispute even  Matsumai  is comprehended under that name that island was early annexed to the  Japanese  empire and is chiefly peopled with exiles We have two accounts of the inhabitants of this country one is left us by Captain  Saris  the other by the  Dutch  Purchas's Pilgr vol i p  the former gives us the following information on the subject which he collected from a sensible  Japanese  who had actually visited the island of  Matsumai  we may collect from him that it was known to the  Japanese  by the name of  Yedso  or  Jeso  The relation beginning thus  DESCRIBED  THAT  Yedso  is an island and lyeth on the northwest side of  Japan  and distant from thence ten leagues that the people are white and of good condition but very hairy all their bodies over like munkeyes Their weapones are bowes and arrowes  poysoned The people in the southernmost part thereof doe understand weight and measure whereof within the land thirtie dayes journey they are ignorant They haue much silver and sand gold whereof they make payment to the  Jappanners  for rice c Rice and cotton cloath of  Japan  is heere well requested iron and lead is brought to them from  Japan  Necessaries for the belly and backe are most vendible to them rice transported from  Japan  to  Yedso  hath yeelded foure for one  THE town where the  Japanners  have their chiefe residence and mart is called  Matchma  therein are five hundred household of  Japanners  who likewise have a fort there the governour whereof is called  Matchmadonna  This towne of  Matchma  is the principall marte towne of all  Yedzo  whither the natines most resort to buy and sell especially in  September  for their prouision for winter In  March  they bring downe salmon and dryed fish of sundrie sorts and other wares for which the  Japanners  barter which the  Japanners  rather desire than siluer  THE  Japanners  haue no setled being or trade in any other towne then  Matchma  That further to the northward upon the same land are people of very low stature like dwarfes That the  Yedzos  are people of the stature of the  Japanners  and haue no apparell but what is brought them from  Japan  That there settleth a very violent current between  Yedzo  and  Japan  which commeth from  Corea  and setteth to the eastnortheast That the winds are for the most part as usually they are in  Japan  viz that the northerly winds beginne in  September  and end in  March  and then the southerly winds begin to blow  THE account given by the commander of the  Castricom  concurs in a great measure with the above The author of the  Recueil de Voyages au Nord  vol iv has preserved the voyage It appears that the captain had landed in several places that in Lat ° ′ he found the country very mountanous and high covered with lofty trees many of which were fit for masts the soil very clayey and wet and near the shores covered with brushwood it was reported that there were several rich silver mines  IN Lat ° ′  ACQUIES  at a place called  Acquies  the land was very high and covered with trees The soil clayey but producing good fruits such as mulberries red and white gooseberries raspberries c also oaks and other kinds of trees and in the vallies lilies of a vast height The rivers are bordered by rushes and also with red roses  IN Lat ° ′ he fell into a great gulph abounding with salmon the shore was covered with vegetables and had the appearance of the coasts of  England  but the natives neither cultivated the ground nor made any advantage of their rich soil The most northern part of the range which he touched at on this coast was in Lat ° ′ where he found the land rise into little hills cloathed with herbage and met with good anchorage in from to fathoms depth with a bottom of sand  HE speaks in general of the inhabitants of the coast of  Jeso  as being strong and square made  NATIVES OF JESO  short and gross their hair and beard long and the last so thick as almost to cover their whole face their bodies likewise very hairy the hair on the  fore part of the head is shaved The features are tolerably good their eyes black forehead flat complexion yellow both sexes wear rings in their ears and on their fingers Their dress is of the  Japanese  fashion some is made of silk others of stuff and others of the skins of animals  THEIR houses are built against the slope of a hill  HOUSES  constructed of planks and covered with the bark of trees they are supported by the trunks and have an hole at top to let out the smoke their fireplace is in the middle of the floor their doors so low that they are obliged to creep in The only furniture is matting made by the women to these add a cup and a plate of varnished ware for each individual in the family In some respects the houses resemble those of  Nootka Sound  and are in groups of fifteen or twenty each group about half a league distant from the other and each seems to be peopled with a kindred clan  THE common food of the natives is the lard and oil of whales  FOOD  fish and all sorts of vegetables especially the fruit of roses which are as large as medlars and being dried are considered as excellent winter provision Notwithstanding this they often die of cold or famine It is customary with them to put their dead into a case and cover them with oystershells these are supported by four posts placed beneath huts neatly made  THE natives of  Matsumai  shew very few signs of religion  RELIGION  nor have they any idols When they drink if they are near the fire they pour a few drops into it they also stick in their chambers some small rods with little flags at the end If a  person falls sick they cut long slips of the wood and tie them round the head and arms of the patient  NOTWITHSTANDING the rude appearance of these people  MANNERS  they are prudent and civilized in their manners and among strangers pay them the compliment of putting on their best cloaths  THEY are a very indolent race never cultivate the ground but pass much of their time on the water in canoes which they call  praos  cut out of the trunk of some great tree raised on the side with planks In these they go to the chace of seals which they shoot with arrows or of whales which they harpoon They beside catch other fishes with seines in the manner done in  Europe  Several objects of chace are mentioned Birds they catch in snares and shoot with arrows elks roes stags bears and other animals unknown to the  Dutch  navigators Besides the weapons I have mentioned they wear a short cutlass made of iron which they procure from the  Japanese  HEMP grows wild in the country  HEMP  the women spin it I suppose by splitting it first they then hold one end between their teeth and turn and twist it into thread on a distaff  THE natives exchange with the  Japanese  the lard and oil of whales and fishes the dried tongues of whales furs and feathers of eagles for winging of arrows The people of  Japan  pay them an annual visit and bring in return rice sugar silken cloaths in the  Japanese  fashion smoakingpipes tobacco and varnished cups and plates The  Japanese  seem to have introduced civilization among these people by their intercourse with  them The  Chinese  sometimes come and trade with them The capital of this chain of islands is called  Matsumai  and is the residence of the prince or governor who annually makes a voyage to  Jedo  to do homage to the emperor The  Japanese  once attempted to extend their conquests from  Matsumai  northward they succeeded at first but after a revolt of the inhabitants  Kaempfer i p  are now content to accept from the chieftain whom they stile prince of  Jeso  a tribute of very small value which is annually paid at  Matsumai  WE now arrive at the southernmost isles of the long chain of the  Kurils  KURIL ISLES  I have given an account of the most northern in my introduction to the  Arctic Zoology  The whole chain diverges to the northeast in a direct line and concludes very near to the cape of  Lopatka  in  Kamschatka  The  Russians  reckon  Matsumai  among the number Those next to the land of  Jeso  were discovered by the  Casticrom Tschicota Kounaschir  and  Atorkou  are the most southern the two first lie opposite to  Matsumai  and at no great distance from its coasts and  Atorkou  a little to the northeast  Tschicota  is a hundred and twenty versts or ninety miles long and forty miles broad  Kounaschir  is about a hundred and twelve miles long and about thirtyseven broad and  Atorkou  or  Etorpu  is equal in length and breadth being two hundred and twentyfive miles across according to the  Russian  accounts in the  Neue Nordische Beytrage  Vol iv  This island is the  Statenland  of the  Dutch  STATENLAND  a name bestowed on it in their voyage of  Ouropi  is the  Company  's land of the same voyagers  COMPANY'S LAND  and they  bestowed on the streight which separates it from  Atorkou  the name of  De Vries's  DE VRIES'S STREIGHT  in honor of their commander No places have puzzled geographers so greatly  D'Anville  gives to  Jeso Josogasima  as it is sometimes called the form of a vast island and to the  Company's Land  and  Statenland  a figure possibly very different from the reality The editors of  Cook  's Voyage make them only small islands The  Russians  again in their history of  Kamschatka  give them another form and Mr  Arrowsmith  very properly leaves it undecided whether  Jeso  is continent or archipelago This being mentioned we hasten to the conclusion of this volume and give a brief account of the remainder of the  Kuril  isles  Etorpu  the nineteenth in order reckoning from  Lopatkanoss  comes next Most of the islands of this long chain are volcanic  Raschotti  the tenth has in our days been so rent with an earthquake as entirely to drive away the numerous flocks of birds that used to frequent its cliffs but the sealions still keep their stations  VOLCANOES  On  Kounaschir  the twentieth is one volcano on  Etorpu  are two on  Amakutan  another and on the lofty  Poromoschir  the highest in the chain remarkable for its vast peaked mountains is probably another I have treated of these islands so fully in my introduction to the  Arctic Zoology  that I shall not tire my reader with the repetition I therefore will only say here that many of them have been conquered by the  Russians  who not thinking them worth the expence of colonizing content themselves with accepting a small tribute  THE inhabitants resemble those of the land of  Jeso  NATIVES  and are equally hairy By the accounts of the  Russians  who visited these  islands in they differ in some of their customs from the former They have multitudes of little household gods like the  Mongol Tartars  and they pay a worship to the owl The  Mongols  do the same for the reason given in the zoological part of the  Arctic Zoology  Vol i p  This may direct us to the origin of these islanders They bury their dead in the earth and believe in a future life to be passed in certain subterraneous regions  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME  APPENDIX  A
