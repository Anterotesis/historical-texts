 EDWIN AND ANGELINA  A BALLAD  BY MR GOLDSMITH  Printed for the Amusement of the COUNTESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND  DEIGN saintlike tenant of the dale  To guide my nightly way  To yonder fire that chears the vale  With hospitable ray  For here deserted as I tread  With fainting steps and slow  The wild immeasurably spread  Seems lengthening as I go  Forbear my son the sage replies  To tempt the lonely gloom  For yonder faithless phantom flies  To lure thee to thy doom  Here to the houseless child of want  My door is open still  And tho' my portion is but scant  I give it with good will  Then turn tonight and freely share  Whate'er my cell bestows  My rushy couch and frugal fare  My blessing and repose  No flocks that range the valley free  To slaughter I condemn  Taught by that Power that pities me  I learn to pity them  But from the mountain's grassy side  A guiltless feast I bring  A scrip with herbs and fruits supply'd  And water from the spring  Then turn tonight thy cares forego  All earthborn cares are wrong  "Man wants but little here below  "Nor wants that little long"  Soft as the dew from heav'n descends  His gentle accents fell  The modest stranger lowly bends  And follows to the cell  Far in a wilderness obscure  The lonely mansion lay  A refuge to th' unshelter'd poor  And strangers led astray  No stores beneath its humble thatch  Requir'd a master's care  The wicket op'ning with a latch  Receiv'd the harmless pair  And now when busy crowds retire  To take their evening rest  The hermit trim'd his little fire  And chear'd his pensive guest  And spread his vegetable store  And gaily prest and smil'd  And skill'd in legendary lore  The ling'ring hours beguil'd  While round in sympathetic mirth  Its tricks the kitten tries  The cricket chirrups in the hearth  The crackling faggot flies  But nothing mirthful could assuage  The pensive stranger's woe  For grief had seiz'd his early age  And tears would often flow  His rising cares the hermit spy'd  With answering care opprest  And whence unhappy youth he cry'd  The sorrows of thy breast  From better habitations spurn'd  Reluctant dost thou rove  Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd  Or unregarded love  Say what is friendship but a name  A charm that lulls to sleep  A shade that follows wealth or fame  But leaves the wretch to weep  And what is love an empty sound  The modern fair one's jest  On earth unseen or only found  To warm the turtle's nest  For shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  And spurn the sex he said  But while he spoke a rising blush  His lovelorn guest betray'd  Surpriz'd he sees new beauties rise  Expanding to the view  Like colours o'er the morning skies  As bright as transient too  The bashful look the rising breast  Alternate spread alarms  The lovely stranger stands confest  A maid in all her charms  And ah forgive a stranger rude  A thing forlorn she cried  Whose feet unhallow'd thus intrude  Where heaven and you reside  Forgive and let thy pious care  An heart's distress allay  That seeks repose but finds despair  Companion of the way  My father liv'd of high degree  Remote beside the Tyne  And as he had but only me  Whate'er he had was mine  To win me from his tender arms  Unnumber'd suitors came  Their chief pretence my flatter'd charms  My wealth perhaps their aim  Each hour the mercenary crowd  With glitt'ring proffers strove  Among the rest young Edwin bow'd  Who offer'd only love  In humble simplest habit clad  No wealth nor power had he  Wisdom and worth were all he had  And these were all to me  Whene'er he spoke amidst the train  How would my heart attend  And still delighted even to pain  How sigh for such a friend  And when a little rest I sought  In sleep's refreshing arms  How have I mended what he taught  And lent him fancied charms  Yet still and woe betide the hour  I spurn'd him from my side  And still with ill dissembled power  Repaid his love with pride  'Till quite dejected with my scorn  He left me to deplore  And sought a solitude forlorn  And ne'er was heard of more  Then since he perish'd by my fault  This pilgrimage I pay  I'll seek the solitude he sought  And stretch me where he lay  And there in shelt'ring thickets hid  I'll linger till I die  'Twas thus for me my lover did  And so for him will I  Thou shalt not thus the hermit cried  And clasp'd her to his breast  Th' astonish'd fairone turn'd to chide  'Twas EDWIN's self that prest  For now no longer could he hide  What first to hide he strove  His looks resume their youthful pride  And flush with honest love  Turn ANGELINA ever dear  My charmer turn to see  Thy own thy longlost EDWIN here  Restor'd to love and thee  Thus let me hold thee to my heart  And every care resign  And shall we never never part  My life my all that's mine  No never from this hour to part  Our love shall still be new  And the last sigh that rends thy heart  Shall break thy EDWIN's too  Here amidst sylvan bow'rs we'll rove  From lawn to woodland stray  Blest as the songsters of the grove  And innocent as they  To all that want and all that wail  Our pity shall be given  And when this life of love shall fail  We'll love it again in heaven  THE END
