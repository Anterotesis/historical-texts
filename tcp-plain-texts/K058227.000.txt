behind the Scenes  DON'T be alarm'd my friend you need not be in fear  None but goodnatur'd folks I'm positive are here  Coming forward to the audience  To plead a brother's cause who trembling stands behind  A volunteer I comeand beg you will be kind  To this his first begottenshew your fost'ring care  And let his tender bantling in your favours share  "In art's perfection is the growth of years  "The bud must open ere the flower appears"  Each litele fault or blemish pass regardless by  But mark each glimpse of merit with approving eye  Tho' yet a raw unpractis'd novice he appear  Let but your gen'rous plaudits dissipate his fear  To bolder heigths hereafter he may wing his flight  And give you then much greater pleasure and delight  For applause you all know's the life of endeavour  Without it in vain is our study and labour  To each critic I sueon each fair one rely  Many looks of indulgence methinks I espy  As a sketch of his planhis attempt is to shew  The nice Fop of the age and the Libertine too  Their vices and follies hold up to derision  That feeling its force they may shew their contrition  Virtue and beauty's charms he likewise sets to view  Allpowerful charms such as shou'd ev'ry heart subdue  From nature's wide and ample field his plan he draws  And hopes to please you all by her unerring laws  Then with candour attendlet no prejudice rise  But shew yourselves pleas'd both with hands and with eyes  The Writers of the two following PROLOGUES it is hoped will excuse their not being spoken as the foregoing one was written for that purpose prior to their being received  PROLOGUE I  WHEN Folly with dame Fashion's forces join'd  Usurp'd inglorious empire o'er mankind  When Virtue sunk beneath the ironband  Of Vice who stalk'd gigantic thro' the land  Oft has  Thalia  fir'd with generous rage  Lash'd the proud tyrants on th' instructive Stage  Unmask'd their every art then headlong hurl'd  From their high thrones those sovereigns of our world  Bid injur'd Reason her lost rights again  Resume and of the passions take the rein  Whilst fickle Fashion own'd her ruling hand  And fix'd the mode or alter'd at her dread command  'Twas she who bid our trembling bard engage  To lash the folly of this  fribbling  age  "H********" she cry'd "oft has a fluttering train  "Of  empty beings  scarce the  shades  of  men    "Provok'd my laughter as they mov'd along  "  Each to the music of his own soft tongue    "The task be thine to seize the motly crew  "And drag them forth expos'd to public view  "Hastecan thy eye mistake'emNoon high  "Their  fronts  arise and seem to prop the sky  "Whilst all their  wit  and  sense  and  judgment  join'd  "In one large  roll  bangs pendant from behind  "Like the  sweet warblers  of Italian strains  "Unknown to  Love's  soft pleasures and his pains  "When Beauty courts them with alluring eye  "Fleet as the slag before the hounds they fly  "When  Britain  calls her valiant sons to arms  "Their milky souls no martial ardour warms  "For all their  courage  lodges in the heel  "And  fear's  the  only  passion they can feel  "Save that in which they every hour employ  "Narcissuslike  the selfadmiring joy  "Hasteseize the  dear insipids  bravely dare  "To wage with Folly and with Fashion war  "These these are comic satyr's noblest game"  She ceas'dand sought fair  Aganippes'  stream  Our Bard obedient to the high command  The feeble effort of his trembling hand  This night presents O deign ye gen'rous fair  With smiles propitious to reward his care  Ye that reside in our theatric skies  Higher than e'er advent'rous muse durst rise  Ye in the cloudsand ye who lowly sit  Judges supreme of poetry and wit  Kindly receive'tHe asks no deathless name  Bright in the annals of eternal fame  Kindly receiv'tnor to th' infernal gloom  Of  Pluto  's realms his infant offspring doom  But judge with candour each observing friend  "And  spare  your censure where you can't commend"  W P  PROLOGUE II  Enters drunk

 Comes forward  Bold was the man that first engag'd in fight  Far bolder hethat durst engageto write  The Merchant bold that first launch'd out to sea  But which of these was half so bold as me  That dar'd to preface such an unfledg'd COMEDY  An Act like this might teach Hibernian brow  With shame to sicken or with blushes glow  My  dauntless soul  even mine  began to quake  When firstwas told"This Prologue  you  must speak"  My friend quoth I wou'd you persuade the town  To let this  thing  you call a  play  go down  First braze my frontor double braze your own  Lord Sir saidhe  mimicking the author's manner  I'm clearly out o'th' case  No Dublin mark appears upon my face  While yours rejoices in a case of brass  Another brushyour phiz perhaps wou'd take it  Th' ironic scoundrel simper'd as he spake it  A blush might coveror conceal your fear  ButfaithI've got no brazing Metals  here    Unless you'll try this honest batch of  claret    The best of  varnish  zounds manlet us share it  "Thus arm'd behold intrepidly I go  "To plead your causeand with a suppl' ant bow  "Implore the gods  abovegalleries  the goddesses  belowboxes  "Their smiles secur'dthe critic  pit  I defy  "'Twere  mad  to damn a fav'rite of the  skygalleries  "Or shou'd their rabid rage misplac'd light here  on himself    "I value nor Parthian quiver of spear"  singing the tune    "Choice nonpareils"  in the tune  "in vain shall whiz around my ear  "We tipsy fellows  staggers  claim some aid divine  "And if not  me  they'll reverence the  wine  "  staggers    But holdmy mem'ryhan't I

PROMISE  What Promisewhere the deuce have you hid yourself for the last fortnight  Lord Promise  Tho' buried in obscurity yet busily employed I assure youBut hey dayWhat can you be possibly dress'd for nowYou are not going to a masquerade  Epi  No  L Pro  You don't intend this for a wedding suit I hope  Epi  NoStrike me into a non entity if I do  L Pro  Ha ha haCome what's the real occasion  Epi  To display my taste and elegance and I think this will give a convincing proof of both  L Pro  Ha ha haUpon my soul you make such large advances to the feminine gender that in a little time 'twill be difficult to tell to which sex you belong  Epi  I wou'd have it soI do it to be distinguished from the Tramontanebut I want to know where you have beenI have hunted all the public places in London for you without success and I thought if alive I must have met you at one of them  L Pro  You find you are mistaken thenI can readily live without a continual round of dissipation though to you it may be impossibleYour existence depends upon dress and fashionI despise bothEven my pleasures are different from yoursI am wholly devoted to the charms of beauty you to those hourly discovered by your lookingglass  Epi  And pray which are most harmless to mankind I who am amused by dress and a passion for myself or you who for a trifling gratification  are continually studying the ruin of every girl handsome enough to attract your Notice  L Pro  Why Jack you have not spirit enough to make an attack upon any female either in an honourable or any other mannerNow the warmth of my constitution hurries me on to pleasures which you tasteless mortals never dream of  Epi  And often exposes you to very disagreeable consequencesWitness Miss Standfield  L Pro  True it sometimes happens sobut then I have courage to support myself under those difficultiesAnd now you mention her I own she was a girl I lov'd more than I thought the levity of my nature cou'd admit of  Epi  Yes you gave a conspicuous proof of that  L Pro  I didHer father Major Standfield was my particular friend a man I had an uncommon regard fortherefore I avoided meeting him afterwards lest some unlucky chance shou'd lodge my sword in his bosomThat you'll allow was honourable  Epi  Oh humane and honourable to the highest degree  L Pro  Yes after the many proofs of my skill in the sword I could have no reason to doubt its success with an old man so to be entirely out of harm's way I took that opportunity of gratifying my desire in visiting the principal courts of Europe  Epi  To which accident I was indebted for the pleasure of your company home from Naples  L Pro  You wasDuring near five years residence abroad I have never even heard from the poor girl though upon my soul I have often severely felt for the unhappy situation I left her inwhich plainly proves that I am not destitute of compassion  Epi  Oh a miracle of tenderness  L Pro  In foreign climes as well as at home I was confirm'd in my favourite principle that  Women if rightly attack'd are sure to yieldI found you indeed an altered fellow without either life or soul nor cou'd my utmost endeavours arouse youI wanted you to be a man of spirit your ambition was to appear a firstrate Macaroni you are returned fully qualified and determined I see to shew the world what a contemptible creature an Englishman dwindles into when he adopts the follies and vices of other nations  Epi  Strike me speechless George if you are not devilish severebut  par late liber amente  I can't take any thing ill you sayMay illbreeding be my portion if I don't pity your want of tasteLet me tell you my Lord 'tis we who enjoy all the real pleasures of life without any of its inconveniencesLove I grant you is not admitted into our system We look upon it at best as a passion attended with so many disagreeable sensations that it is not worth the pursuit  L Pro  What a fellow for a girl of my sister's sense to be united to  Epi  'Tis true we do amuse ourselves sometimes with the ladiesimitate their mannersbut carefully avoid all serious connection with themOh Lord what a horrid thing love must beTo take off all attention from ourselves and study to be what you call manly brave noble and generous in order to appear amiable in the eyes of the fairHa ha haNo no by all that's ridiculous it will never do  L Pro  Then has a pretty girl no influence on thee  Epi  Not in the leastMay the sun freckle me if she has but as she regards my dress and conversation  L Pro  No you do not wish to make a conquest of one  Epi  Not I by all that's fashionable Hearkee Promise do you think if I loved a girl that I cou'd  devote the time I do to the more essential business of decorating my personLook at me well and answer truly  L Pro  Nothat wou'd then be one of your least cares  Epi  Then may my cloaths misfit me if I wou'd forego that happiness to possess all the graces the poets ever assembled in women  L Pro  You'll except my sisterHow do you intend to manage in that affair  Epi  Now you puzzle mebut when I know myself I'll tell you  L Pro  Have you seen her since you came home  Epi  No but I design it  L Pro  Take care or you'll lose herShe's followed now by a brisker loverBut that I find wou'd be no misfortune to youDon't you think our old dads were rather foolish when they signed that contract which obliges you to marry each other or forfeit thirty thousand pounds  Epi  I am afraid I shall suffer by their follyBut who is the happy man  L Pro  Tom Clement a worthy young fellow of family and fortune  Epi  I don't know him  L Pro  I suppose notCome I'll introduce you to two of the loveliest angelic creatures the sun ever shone upon  Epi  If you can convince me the sun shines upon any one I love better than myself you may if not excuse mePray who are these lovely angelic creatures  L Pro  They are two of the fairest of Eve's daughters whom I have just decoyed up to town upon the old scheme  Epi  Then I may conclude it was about them you were so busily employ'd during your late invisibility  L Pro  RightNot having visited my father's eslate in the wilds of Yorkshire since my return from travel I resolv'd upon an excursion thitherThe romantic beauty of the country pleased me much presenting an agreeable contrast to the place I had just leftOn Sunday knowing the church to be the only spot where I might pick and chuse the rustics to advantage I resolved not to miss the opportunity  Epi  For shame my Lord have you so little religion in you  L Pro  Much the same as yourself in that respect my boyThere is only this difference you cannot think I will notBut how shall I express the astonishment which seized me upon beholding amongst many of homely garb and feature two of the sweetest girls nature ever formed  Epi  So soFresh Game  L Pro  On enquiry I found they were daughters to an old gentleman whom a variety of misfortunes had drove to this part of the world as an asylumThe eldest was handsome enough to justify the disguises of Jove had he been on earthBut never was modesty beauty and native elegance so happily united as in the youngestI am not adamant at any time here I took fire in an instantAs soon as service was over which I thought the longest ever performed I introduced myself to the father and his two sylvan deities  Epi  You have a laconic method by all that's modestWell what success  L Pro  I think you need not ask that at any timeI seldom fail even when circumstances are against me much less when considered as the only son of the Earl of Witton and heir to the estate many miles round about meThe father received me with the greatest respect the daughters with a bewitching innocent diffidence which gave fresh lustre to their encreasing charms  Epi  And yet those very charms you are labouring to destroy  L Pro  Don't interrupt meI soon found that nothing was to be done amongst those peaceful wildsLondon was the only place where I cou'd manage them to my wishThey never had been there and I gloried in being their introducer  Epi  I shou'd have thought it a hard matter to have enticed them hither  L Pro  No quite easy to meA few days ingratiated me into the old gentleman's favourReplete with every virtue which can warm the human heart his honest unsuspecting mind has not an idea of deceitIndeed if he had my plan was laid so well he cou'd hardly have suspected itMany years had he pass'd in this unfrequented vale where he intomb'd one of the best of wivesSince her decease his chief care has been the education of these two darling daughters  Epi  Which for the future you are willing to ease him the trouble ofVery charitable upon my word my Lord  L Pro  To own a truth to you Epicene I often know I am acting wrong tho' I have not courage enough to set myself rightEven in this caseSuch is Mr Lambton's character so revered his goodness that I will freely confess I never undertook any project of the like nature with half the remorse or compunction I did this  Epi  You are an original by all that's whimsicalHow can you be so deliberately wicked  L Pro  I am notYouth and the impetuous dictates of nature impel meI dread to look backYet cou'd I find but one of the sex above temptation perhaps I might be reclaim'dBut no more I want your immediate assistance in this affair  Epi  Mine  L Pro  Yes yoursdon't be amaz'dThat was my errand hither  Epi  The deuce it wasto what end  L Pro  Why as you are a particular friend I'll spare you one of the girls  Epi  I am much obliged to you George but I beg to be excused  L Pro  Ha ha haAre you afraid of venturing yourself with her This is my businessYour House is very large commodious and retired  Epi  Well what of that  L Pro  Can't you spare me half of it to remain entirely at my disposal during this affair  Epi  Why my House  L Pro  As this is a particular case I cou'd not so well manage every thing at one of those common receptaclesBesides if there shou'd be any noise it cannot so easily be heard there  Epi  Pray let's hear your scheme  L Pro  I found that my father knew Mr Lambton and intended had he not been called abroad so suddenly to have drawn him from obscurity I like a dutiful son was resolved to fulfil his desires therefore counterfeiced a letter from him inviting Mr Lambton up to town promising to provide handsomely for himFull of primitive simplicity he immediately swallowed the bait the family are just arrived in London and I am about to consummate my project  Epi  A hopeful one I perceive  L Pro  Only to separate the daughters from the father and under pretence of visiting my sister bring them hither  Epi  How will you manage for a lady to represent her  L Pro  Suppose I dress you up They are ignorant of the world and the deceit will easily pass upon them  Epi  No that I think would be carrying the joke too far  L Pro  I did but jest I have already provided one for the characterYou'll have no objection tho' I hope to lend me a helping hand upon the occasion  Epi  Why if you'll free me from any danger which may ensue on a discovery I confess I shou'd like the frolic well enough  L Pro  Never fearYours will be an agreeable task to entertain the eldestShe's wild and flighty owing to the solitude she was educated in yet fraught with such Innocence and simplicity that had I not beheld her sister every wish wou'd have been gratified in her  Epi  So you want me to amuse her while you besiege your favourite object  L Pro  I do who in such a situation I think cannot fail to surrender  Epi  What do you imagine the father will be doing in the mean time  L Pro  I have taken care the shall not interrupt me and now that matters are settled with you I'll step and see how they do after their journey  Epi  Do you hear George come back directly that I may know how to proceed  L Pro  As soon as possibleNot a minute is now to be lost till that arrives which crowns my bliss in the enjoyment of love and beauty  Exit  Epi  How these foolish passions transport the man What are his raptures of love and beauty to the superior delights of a grand  coup d'eclat  at the dear dear masquerade  Exit  SCENE  Varnish's House  Mr  LAMBTON  Miss  LAMBTON MARIA  Mr Lambton  Thank heaven we are safe arrived'Twas a fatiguing journey for one of my years and nothing could have induced me to revisit the world but the hopes of you my children reaping some future advantage from itAs for myself  declined in the vale of life I was content with my situationI thankfully enjoyed the blessings of providence nor envied the ideal happiness of those above me  Maria  Indeed papa I think you were much in the rightFor my part I prefer a cottage with virtue to a palace with guilt  Miss Lambton  So do I yet I think it possible to gain the palace without partaking of the guilt  Mar  I'm afraid you'll find yourself mistaken sister  Miss Lamb  Perhaps notEvery Thing at present seems fair for itUnder the protection of so great a man as the Earl of Witton what have we to fearAre not we to be introduced to Lord Promise's sisterWhat may not she do for usI'm sure if I enjoy'd her fortune my heart would delight in finding out proper objects to make happy  Mr Lamb  True child it shou'd be the province of those whom providence hath thus distinguished and I acknowledge I've heard the best of characters of bothI am not apt lightly to distrust yet when I reflect on our situation it makes me dread a disappointmentAbove two hundred miles from homeOur money almost exhausted in coming hitherNot even an acquaintance in London to apply toAnd two daughters in some degree objects of temptation exposed to the snares of such a town as this with only an aged father to protect themIn such  Miss Lamb  I can assure you papa you torment yourself with groundless chimerasCould any one behave more politely than Lord PromiseDid not he say you might depend upon his father's friendship for youIs not his letter the greatest securitySurely then you cannot hesitate a moment in preferring affluence to the indigence we have just quitted  Mr Lamb  Daughter he that possesses content is richer than a scepter'd monarchWhat cares had I to disturb me at MonktownMy honest friends and neighbours during the many years I passed  amongst them regarded me as a father friend and Instructor Poor people my heart is with you stillBut I must now go see that Ralph has got our little baggage sage we need not expect to meet here with that fidelity and simplicity which characterizes our untaught villagers  Exit  Miss Lamb  Still sister I find you have not a very favourable opinion of the cause which brought us hither  Mar  I own I have notEver since leaving our peaceful dwelling I know not why but an unusual sadness has taken possession of me  Miss Lamb  Oh that's easily accounted forIt is because you left that dear sweet sighing swain of yours Mr Wilville behindTho' Sir Harry Temple was with him yet I was not sadOur journey to me seem'd enchantingly pleasantOh LudThe swiftness of our expeditionthe variety of objectsthe uncommon politeness we were treated with on the roadthe amazing noise hurry and bustle we saw in coming hither has filled my mind with images I never had the least Idea of beforeOh happy happy creatures who continually enjoy such blessings without interruption  Mar  Perhaps not so happy as you imagine sisterThere may be real enjoyments here as well as in retirement but I am apt to think true content is easier to be found in the mossgrown cot than the cloudaspiring dome  Miss Lamb  There again we differI am heartily weary of solitude and leave to you the undisturbed enjoyment of going to rest with the sun that like him you may be the harbinger of morntreading the cowslip bending green to visit your lowing herds who constantly welcome and reward you with overflowing bowls of nectarat noon feasting on patriarchal luxuriestowards evebut let that suffice Contrast it with what Lord Promise told us of a sine lady's lifeRising at noonpaying morning visits  dining at sixdressingthen whirling away to routs balls assemblies masquerades where brilliant company music dancing and card parties make the time glide insensibly away till blushing morn unfolds the fringed curtains of the gilded east and tears them unwillingly from their half enjoyed pleasuresIf such a description be true who in their senses wou'd have a doubt which to prefer  Mar  Sister we had better not entirely depend upon all Lord Promise told usA little time I am afraid will dispel the mist which overshadows your reason  Miss Lamb  Then if it be a mist sister I never desire it to be removedAdieu I hope for ever to those purling rills deep embower'd shades and fleecy nibblers of the plain that hitherto have been our companions a brighter scene now opens to my view and if Sir Harry Temple knew but where to trace us my joys then wou'd be compleat  Mar  Flatter not yourself so much Charlotte as to imagine we have such power over themTo accident only are we indebted for their acquaintancenor have we a right to expect it to continue'Tis true they did us a signal piece of service in rescuing us from such a crew of gypsies who meeting us where they did wou'd probably have robb'd perhaps murder'd us  Miss Lamb  I shall ever remember their heroic behaviourHow soon they dispersed and put to flight those dastardly wretchesYour fright gave you additional charms and notwithstanding your timidity and delicacy you gave sufficient testimonies that your deliverer was not indifferent to you  Mar  Too much otherwise I fear for my future peace  Miss Lamb  The adventure was so much to my taste that I enjoyed itMy champion I thought received my acknowledgments with surprizePerhaps  he did not expect such language from the rusticity of our appearance  Mar  Why really it was something uncommon  Miss Lamb  We have often seen them since and they as often offered up their vowsOur father seem'd pleas'd with their visits knows both their families and acknowledges them accomplish'd gentlemen  Mar  'Tis true he does but appearances are oft deceitfulI confess Wilville raised emotions in my breast I had till then been a stranger toThe confusion I was in the danger he rescued me from attended with such a tender respectful behaviour beyond what I had ever seen or imagined made too deep an impression on me ever to be erased  Miss Lamb  I shall keep you in countenance for my heart I believe is in pretty near the same condition  Mar  I left the country with regret as I had not an opportunity of acquainting him with our sudden departureI wish yet fear to see him againPray heaven he be sincere in his professions for I find the future happiness of my life depends upon it  Miss Lamb  That you need not have the least doubt ofI dare say they were distracted on missing us and have dispatch'd emissaries around the country in quest of us  Mar  Hush we are interrupted  Enter Lord  PROMISE  and

well after your journeyI thought it impossible your charms could have received addition yet I find change of air and extraordinary exercise have given encreasing lustre to the vermeil tincture of your cheeks  Mr Lamb  My Lord your politeness makes my girls blush  L Pro  There is no occasion for that Sir they were sufficiently captivating beforeI rode post to town Mr Lambton to apprise my father of your coming but unluckily found him laid up in a fit of the gout  Mr Lamb  I am sorry for it my Lord  L Pro  Why so am I especially as it deprives him of the pleasure of welcoming you as he intendedBut I hope a few days will set him on his legs again and thennot that he hath been idle there is something in view which in all probability will in a very short time make you ample amends for the injuries of fortune  Mr Lamb  My Lord you overwhelm me with kindnessI know not how to  L Pro  Not a word moreBut Mr Lambton my father has a particular request to make you  Mr Lamb  I beg my Lord

Lamb  A  ▪ my Lord I wish you'd excuse themGirls like mine bred up in retirement have not sufficient knowledge of the world to render themselves agreeable to a lady of her rank and quality  L Pro  They have those native graces of the mind and person which are infinitely preferableWhere nature hath been so lavish her handmaid art at distance waits behind conscious of her inability to add to their charmsWhat say you ladies will you favour me so far  Miss Lamb  Just as my papa pleases my Lord  Mr Lamb  Well my Lord since you'll take the trouble of conducting them tho' I am sure you do them too much honour  L Pro  Rather give myself too much pleasure Sir  Miss Lamb  My Lord since you have my papa's permission we'll beg a little time to adjust our dress  L Pro  Name it ladies and my chariot shall attend you  Miss Lamb  About an hour my Lord  L Pro  Very well I shall in the mean while inform my sister that she may prepare for your receptionLadies your most obedientNay no ceremony Mr Lambton  Mr Lamb  Give me leave my Lord to wait upon you down stairs  Exeunt L Pro and Mr Lamb  Miss Lamb  Now sister don't you think my presages will prove true You see fortune already smiles upon usI hope Lady Fanny will invite us to reside with her for the future  Mar  How can you be so flightyYoung as I am every thing to me seems to wear a differe  aspectI do not like Lord Promiso nor this visit and wish you had not so readily engaged yourself  Miss Lamb  You never will have spirit enough to make a figure in the worldHowever do not let us waste the time which shou'd be employ'd in dressing  Mar  If you recollect we need no great preparationour wardrobe is soon looked over  Miss Lamb  Too true and a mortifying recollection it is  Mar  Not in the leastLet not that disturb you

Why nonot quite so violent inh is transports as your brotherIn short I'm inform'd that he is now a finished  petite maitre  Miss Cle  Then I'll answer that he's not a favourite of our sex  L Fan  Quite the contrary to a woman of spiritOh I have not patience every day to see such crowds of mincing whissling powder'd Master Jemmys sill our public places who only want to assume the petticoat to render them compleat Misses  Miss Cle  Ha ha ha really they seem determined to rob us of that distinction  L Fan  Don't you think it wou'd be a just retaliation in us to claim the sword and breeches I'm sure we shou'd become them as well as the best coxcomb of them all  Miss Cle  Suppose you try the experiment  L Fan  No there I beg to be excusedAt present I have other matters in my headYou must know that I have been meditating a pleasant revenge on Epicene for his contemptuous coldness  Miss Cle  He richly deserves it and cou'd not have fallen into better hands for you always discover'd an excellent head for contriving mischief  L Fan  I do love a little of it in my heart and if you'll aid me on this occasion I don't doubt but he'll prove a charming subject to work upon  Miss Cle  Oh

noble family whom you are intimate with  Miss Cle  ReadilyI correspond with several he visited who often mention'd him  L Fan  Very well then you can easily frame a story of your falling in love with him there and following him over to England  Miss Cle  What good will that do  L Fan  A great dealWe must let your brother into the secret as his assistance will be necessaryand  a propos  here he comes  Enter  CLEMENT  Clement  Madam I received your orders and flew upon the wings of  L Fan  Love to be sureI thought soNow for rhapsody of flames darts hearts and eyes all jumbled together to form

and may serve now or any other time  Cle  How can you take such pleasure in tormenting a man who loves to the degree that I do  L Fan  Because the greatest pleasure our sex can enjoy is to tormentI'll not hear a word in answer  I have many times told you that nothing in nature can be more ridiculous than the enraptur'd effusions of two lovestricken creatures to a third personThere is now more interesting Business for youYour rival is in London  Cle  Who Epicene  L Fan  Even heDon't put on a serious face till you have more reasonYou have often heard of the contract executed between Epicene's father and mine by which they were mutually bound that we when of age shou'd marry each other or forfeit thirty thousand pounds  Cle  I have  L Fan  His father is dead and mine has long

spoken"None but the brave deserve the fair"Ha ha haNo great danger at present I believeCome follow me and if I don't put you into a method of obtaining Epicene's part of the bond and amply revenging

your service  Maj  Your worth Madam wou'd if possible atone for your brother's villany  L Fan  Villany  Maj  Yes Lady Fanny the worst of villanyThe wretch who wantonly deprives the credulous virgin of her innocence and peace of mind deserves an epithet much worse than that  L Fan  Has my brother been such a wretch  Maj  He has MadamPardon my thus disturbing you with a repetition of my wrongs I thought to have conceal'd them 'till I had found their authorBut griefs like mine will force their wayAfter sixandtwenty years spent in the service of my country I vainly hoped to pass my latter days in ease and tranquillity blest as I thought myself in a daughter where grace and modesty united to adorn the curious workmanship of heaven  L Fan  Pray go on I am all attention  Maj  Lord Promise Madam whom unsuspectingly I admitted to my inmost friendship in an evil hour gain'd on the fond affection of an artless girl and for a few moments unworthy gratification plunged a dagger in a father's breast and entailed eternal infamy shame and sorrow on the very creature whom honour should have obliged him to protect  L Fan  Merciful powersCan I be related to fuch a monsterNow do I readily account for the fettled melancholy which preyed upon the lovely girl before she quitted London and which I in vain urged her to discloseBut why did you not inform me of this before  Maj  An indignant shame tied up my tongueMy hand tho' old I hoped was not quite unnerved on that alone I relied for satisfactionYet there I was disappointed to avoid my resentment he quitted the kingdomDefeated of my revenge I retired to a little retreat in the farthest part of Devonshire taking with me the tearconcealing yet almost griefconsumed object of his loose desires  L Fan  Poor EugeniaLittle did I suspect the cause of your retreat if I had you shou'd not have gone without a partner in your sorrows  Maj  How can souls so nearly allied by nature differ so much in sentimentThere a few months after I was presented with a grandsonAn event which almost deprived the wretched mother of life in giving birth to the innocent fruit of their guilty commerce  L Fan  What an affecting story  Maj  We have lived ever since in the utmost privacy waiting an opportunity for revenge or justice Last week I received intelligence from a friend whom I entrusted with the secret that he was returned this hastened me up

conceal'd my purposeBut if the first fail I am determined to have recourse to the latterIf I fall my sorrows fall with me and he will have the glory of compleatly finishing the misfortunes of an unhappy family  L Fan  I hope there will be no fear of thatPray is Miss Standfield still in town  Maj  She is Madam  L Fan  Might I hope for the pleasure of seeing her here  Maj  I am afraid my Lady

up in this mannerI'm sure I was easier and better in my own shapesNow pray may I ask what is all this mighty rout about  Miss Lamb  I am going to visit a lady of quality and you must attend mePut on your best behaviour for very likely there will be some grand company there  Ra  Then I think Miss you had better leave me behind  Miss Lamb  Why so  Ra  Because I am sure I shall be dashedFor tho' I am reckon'd as tight a lad and as feat a dancer as any at our maying yet if you'll believe me I can scarce pull up courage enough to shew my shapes amongst the lasses and you know we have some prime ones  Miss Lamb  I must encourage him a little  aside  But you cannot imagine what an alteration there is in you nowThat dress becomes you wonderfully and you look quite graceful  Ra  Yes I always was said to have graceMaster himself often told me that I was a gracious lad  Miss Lamb  No but I mean that you are genteel  Ra  OhWhy for certain all the lasses used to prefer me for my gentility  Miss Lamb  Very well thenbe ruled by me Ralph and I don't doubt but every thing will succeed to my wish  Ra  Mayhap they mayI'm sure Miss I will do all in my power to serve you for never from me if I don't

you ask me to talk as little as possible  Miss Lamb  Yes yes the less you speak the better  Ra  Adad I believe it willYou may tell them I am dumb if you please  Miss Lamb  No that will not do neitherAll I want of you is to behave very mannerly and avoid telling any stories about our mode of living in the country  Ra  Oh let me alone I'll be bound to be cunning enough for the best of themNot but if they are fond of stories I can match them there too for I can tell plenty  Miss Lamb  Stories  Ra  Ay I can tell them the story of St George and the Dragon or Valentine and Orson or

and  WARNISH  Mr Lamb  Mr Varnish your servantI was told you went out Sir and have waited impatiently for your return  Var  I am sorry I shou'd make you waitPray Sir what are your commands with me  Mr Lamb  This house I suppose is yours Sir  Var  It is Sir at your service  Mr Lamb  Lord Promise I presume hired these lodgings for us  Var  His Lordship informed me you was a particular friend of his and requested as a favour that I wou'd accommodate you to prevent the inconveniences attending common lodgings  Mr Lamb  His Lordship was very goodI imagine Sir you are well acquainted with him  Var  I have had the honour of knowing his Lordship these several years past  Mr Lamb  I beg your pardon Sir for being so inquisitiveMy reason was an ambiguous note his Lordship put into my hand at leaving this which you are to explain  Var  What was it pray Sir  Mr Lamb  A draft for an hundred pounds with these words  I hope Mr Lambton will accept of this triste as an earnest of my wishes to serve him I dare not be more explicit at present but Mr Varnish can fully inform him of particulars PROMISE  Var  True Sir his Lordship has repos'd that confidence in me  Mr Lamb  Well Sir I shall take it as a favour if you'll explain his meaning  Var  With all my heart SirLord Promise is a Nobleman of the strictest honour and greatest generosity  Mr Lamb  I don't doubt it Sir  Var  I assure you his generosity is unboundedI have seen such instances of it as wou'd amaze you  Mr Lamb  Indeed I have since my short knowledge of him experienced many proofs of his benevolence  Var  Oh dear Sir nothing to his desires or intentionsThe moment he saw you and your family he was resolv'd to serve you  Mr Lamb  How few Noblemen have such greatness of soul  Var  Very few indeed SirHe observed with concern that you had lived many years in the world to little purpose  Mr Lamb  How Sir I hope notI endeavoured to fulsil the will of him who placed me in such a situation and that I thought the principal end of my creationIf I have erred I trust he will forgive me  Var  Dear Sir you mistake my meaningHe found you grown grey in obscurity without the least reward for such merit  Mr Lamb  Yes Sir I've had the greatest reward that cou'd possibly have been bestow'd upon me here  Var  Really SirWhat was it pray  Mr Lamb  The testimony of a good conscience  Var  I am glad to find it so Sirtho' 'tis more than I can say for myself  aside  But Lord Promise wishes to reward such goodness in this worldHe has many relations of great dignity in the worldThey have heard your character from the Earl and you may depend upon being speedily provided for  Mr Lamb  How shall I acknowledge so many unmerited obligations  Var  Very easilyI hope Mr Lambton your long retirement from the world has not contracted your notions of life  Mr Lamb  I believe not SirOn the contrary the long heartfelt serenity I've enjoy'd has expanded every grateful and noble thought within me  Var  Nay I shou'd not wonder at itPersons long buried in solitude are apt to look with a gloomy aspect on the harmless amusements of the worldAnd those things in their nature perfectly innocent they with a cynic severity condemn as absolutely criminal  Mr Lamb  Far otherwise with me I assure you SirI look on all mankind as my brethren as such I love and wou'd if possible serve themFor surely that wretch must be dead to all feelings whose bosom admits not that heav'nborn child of mercy sweet charity  Var  I am very glad Sir to find you have such enlarged notionsCan you then be so chimerical as to prefer an empty name a few imaginary virtues to solid substantial happiness  Mr Lamb  I don't comprehend you  Var  In a word then Lord Promise is captivated with the beauty of your youngest daughter and it will be your own fault if you do not pass the remainder of your days in ease and tranquillity  Mr Lamb  Lord Promise in love with my daughterit cannot be  Var  Truth every syllable Sir  Mr Lamb  Good heav'n can hebut I won't disturb myselfHe has not sure any dishonourable designs on my poor child  Var  Lord Promise Sir is all honour and generosity  Mr Lamb  I hope soGracious powers how I trembleWhere are my childrenI'll stop their going till I have an explanation of this affair  Var  I met the young ladies going out Sir just as I came in hither  Mr Lamb  Going where  Var  To visit my Lady Fanny Promise  Mr Lamb  Are you sure of that  Var  Quite certain Sir I knew the carriage and liveryI must keep him in suspence till the business is over  aside  Mr Lamb  I am something easierThey'll certainly be safe with herWhen do they return  Var  In about two hours  Mr Lamb  WellIs Ralph my servant in the house  Var  No Sir he attended the ladies  Mr Lamb  I am glad of itI can rely upon his honesty and fidelity  Var  Dear Sir let me beg of you to calm your emotionYour apprehensions are groundless I can assure you  Mr Lamb  They may be soIn the mean time I request you'll return this note to his lordshipI must first know the nature of the obligations he wou'd confer upon mePerhaps they may be such as an honest tho' poor man wou'd be above receiving  Offers the note  Var  Upon my word Sir you must excuse meI dare not accept it without my Lord's knowledgeI shall wait upon him directly and on my return hope fully to satisfy all your scruplesIn the mean time make yourself perfectly easyYou have only to rely on Lord Promise and rest contented  Exit  Mr Lamb  I am not much read or skill'd in the ways of mankind yet I do not like this man's words or looksBoth seem to bear a double meaningI am far from being easy in my mindWou'd I had never come hitherMy poor unfledged young ones I am afraid your father in his latter days has by one imprudent action involv'd you both in ruin but I must

junctureOr who cou'd imagine they wou'd have taken flight during the little time we were absent  Wil  Nothing cou'd equal my astonishment on misfing themUnkind Maria not even to leave a line behind to account for this sudden revolution  Tem  Wilville it must certainly be some unforeseen accident which cou'd drive them up so unexpectedly  Wil  Some fatal one I fear'tis a mystery I am wretched till I unravelI'm sure we lost no time in the pursuitand all along I flatter'd myself with the hopes of overtaking them on the road  Tem  Ay so did IWe drove jehu like for itand yet the cursed postboys cou'd not get on fast enough to satisfy my impatienceZounds I wou'd have outstript the wind and surpass'd all the fables of antiquity to have caught themthe last stage I was almost sure of itthey were not above half an hour beforeSuch a disappointment is enough to turn the brain of a philosopher  Wil  Really Temple I did not think you were so desperately entangled before  Tem  Nor I by my soulI did not know half the power the wild baggage had over me 'till I missed her  Who the devil cou'd suppose I shou'd be taken with so romantic an oddityAnd yet may I perish if I was not struck with her more than

insipidityNot but sometimes I like a scene of the pathetic by way of contrastbut in general they have too much opiate to suit my constitutionNo give me the girl of fancy who soars above the region of vulgar mortals and scorns to tread the beaten paths of dull discretionSuch a charmer is always neweach day discovers fresh incentives to love and we are lost in the pleasing charms of dear variety

up to town with  Wil  Only by sight  Tem  What's his character  Wil  That of a profess'd rakeHe is the only son of the Earl of Witton a nobleman who is now abroad as much respected for his virtue as his dignityWas he at home my first application shou'd be to him as I am certain he has too much honour to countenance his son in any base ungenerous action  Tem  Hearkee TomI'll go directly and call him to an account and if he does not give me a satisfactory answer to my enquiries about the girls sacrifice him to my vengeance  going  Wil  Hold hold be not so rashYou have not the least chance to
