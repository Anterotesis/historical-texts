tender thought  To teach the young idea how to shoot  To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind  To breathe th'enliv'ning spirit and to fix  The gen'rous purpose in the  Female  breast  THOMPSON  BRISTOL Printed and sold by S FARLEY in  CastleGreen  Also sold by T CADELL Bookseller in the  Strand  CARNAN and NEWBERY Booksellers in St  Paul's ChurchYard London  and W FREDERICK Bookseller in  Bath  ADVERTISEMENT  IT has been so hackney'd a practice for Authors to pretend that imperfect copies of their works had crept abroad that the writer of the following Pastoral is almost ashamed to alledge this as the  real  cause of the present publication This little poem was composed several years ago the Author's age eighteen and recited at that Time and since by a party of young Ladies for which purpose it was originally written by this means some mutilated copies were circulated unknown to the Author thro' many Hands  TO Mrs GWATKIN  DEAR MADAM  AS the following little poem turns chiefly on the danger of  delay  or  error  in the important article of  Education  I know not to whom I can with more propriety dedicate it than to you as the subject it inculcates has been one of the principal objects of your attention in your own family Let not the name of  dedication  alarm you I am not going to offend by making your eulogium Panegyric is only necessary to suspicious or common characters Virtue will not accept it Modesty will not offer it  The friendship with which you have honor'd me from my very childhood will I flatter myself be exerted in my favour on this occasion and induce you to pardon  me for venturning without your permission to lay before you this public testimony of my esteem and to assure you how much I am  Dear Madam  Your obedient and obliged humble Servant The AUTHOR  The introductory ADDRESS  Spoken by EUPHELIA  WITH trembling diffidence with modest fear  Before this gentle audience we appear  Ladies survey us with a tender eye  Put on goodnature and lay judgment by  No deeplaid plot adorns our humble page  But scenes adapted to our sex and age  No haughty female's passions here describ'd  Nor chambermaids by jealous husbands brib'd  Simplicity is all our author's aim  She  does not write nor do  we  speak for  fame  To make amusement and instruction friends  A lesson in the guise of play she sends  She claims no merit but her love of truth  No plea to favor but her  sex  and  youth  With these alone to boast she sends me here  To beg your kind indulgent partial ear  Of critic  man  she could not stand the test  But you with softer gentler hearts are bless'd  With  him  she dares not rest her feeble cause  Too low a mark for satire or applause  Ladies protect herdo not be satyric  Spare censure she expects not panegyric  The Characters of the  Pastoral  Four Young Ladies of Distinction in Search of Happiness  FLORISSA  PASTORELLA  LAURINDA  EUPHELIA  URANIA  An ancient Shepherdess  Her Daughters  FLORA  ELIZA  FLORELLA  A Young Shepherdess  The above Characters were represented by young Ladies from eight to fifteen Years old  A SEARCH after HAPPINESS A PASTORAL in Three Dialogues  DIALOGUE I  SCENE A GROVE FLORISSA PASTORELLA LAURINDA EUPHELIA  FLORISSA  WELCOME ye humble vales ye flow'ry shades  Ye murmuring fountains and ye verdant glades  From all the gilded misery of the great  From all the dull impertinence of state  From scenes where daring guilt triumphant reigns  It's dark suspicions and it's hoard of pains  Where pleasure never comes without alloy  And art wou'd varnish o'er fallacious joy  Where folly crowns the day excess the night  And dull satiety succeeds delight  Where midnight vices their fell orgies keep  And guilty revels scare the phantom sleep  Where dissipation wears the name of bliss  From these we fly in search of Happiness  EUPHELIA  And lo at length propitious to our view  Behold the spot our anxious hopes pursue  These branching oaks which old as time appear  Proclaim URANIA'S dwelling to be near  And seeobserve the lowroof'd cottage rise  Not regal domes so grateful to my eyes  PASTORELLA  How the description with the scene agrees  Here lowly thickets there aspiring trees  The hazle copse excluding noonday's beam  The tufted arbor the pellucid stream  The blooming sweetbriar and the hawthorn shade  The springing cowslips and the daisied mead  The wild luxuriance of the fullblown fields  Which spring prepares and laughing Summer yields  EUPHELIA  Here simple nature strikes the raptur'd eye  With charms which wealth and art but ill supply  The genuine graces which  without  we find  Display the beauty of the owner's mind  LAURINDA  Yes be assur'd this grove contains the cell  Where sage URANIA and her children dwell  FLORELLA too if right we've heard the tale  With them residesthe lily of the vale  FLORISSA  But soft what gentle female form appears  Which rosy health and softest beauty wears  Some Angel sure commission'd from above  Or else the smiling genius of the grove  Enter  FLORELLA  who speaks  What do I seeye beauteous virgins say  What chance conducts your steps this desart way  Do you pursue some fav'rite lambkin stray'd  Or do you alders court you to their shade  Declare fair strangers for if right I deem  No rustic nymphs of vulgar rank you seem  FLORISSA  No cooling shades allure our eager sight  Nor lambkin lost our searching steps invite  FLORELLA  Or is it haply yonder branching vine  Whose trunk the woodbine's fragrant tendrils twine  Whose spreading height with purple clusters crown'd  Attracts the gaze of ev'ry nymph around  Or doth the juicy pear your eyes invite  Whose rich delicious ripeness tempts the sight  Say is it this or ought I have beside  FLORELLA'S fruits her flow'rs her fleecy pride  EUPHELIA  FLORELLA our united thanks receive  Sole proof of gratitude we have to give  And since you deign to ask O courteous fair  The motive of our unremitting care  Know then our wishes terminate in this  And what we seek and crave isHappiness  FLORISSA  Long have we search'd throughout this bounteous isle  With constant ardor and with ceaseless toil  The various ways of various life we've tried  But peace sweet peace hath ever been deny'd  We've sought in vain thro' ev'ry different state  The rich the poor the lowly and the great  Doth she with Kings in palaces reside  Or dwells obscurely far from pomp and pride  To learn this truth we've bid a long adieu  To all the shadows blinded men pursue  We seek URANIA her whose virtues fire  Our virgin hearts to  be  what we  admire  Report hath blazon'd her accomplish'd mind  The spotless mansion of the graces join'd  For tho' with care she shuns the public eye  Yet worth like her's can ne'er obscurely lie  LAURINDA  On such a fair and faultless model form'd  By prudence guided and by virtue warm'd  Perhaps FLORELLA can direct our youth  And point our footsteps to the paths of truth  FLORELLA  New as I am to life's all varying scene  Scarce knowing yet what vice and virtue mean  Unskill'd in points which sage experience shews  I dare not solve the question you propose  But wou'd you know the way to perfect bliss  Which virtue and the virtuous never miss  The Dame you seek inhabits yonder cell  In her united worth and wisdom dwell  Poor not dejected humble yet not mean  Chearful tho' grave and lively tho' serene  Benevolent kind pious gentle just  Reason her guide and Providence her trust  If Heav'n indulgent to her little store  Adds to that little but a little more  With pious praise her grateful heart o'erflows  And sweetly mitigates the sufferers woes  Her labors for devotion best prepare  And meek devotion smooths the brow of care  Two lovely daughters make her little state  The dearest blessings of propitious fate  Under her kind protecting wing I live  She gives to allfor she has much to give  Since Heav'n hath bless'd her with an ample  heart  A liberal  soul  which wou'd to all impart  But wise in all it's operations join'd  A narrow fortune to a noble mind  PASTORELLA  Her bright perfections charm my listening ear  Elate with hope we come to seek her here  To ask the way to virtue and to bliss  Of her who boasts supremest Happiness  FLORELLA  Doubtless fair nymph from her you may receive  Advice and pray'r the whole she has to give  LAURINDA  Lead fair FLORELLA to that humble shed  Where peace resides from courts and cities fled  End of the First DIALOGUE  DIALOGUE II  SCENE a COTTAGE in the GROVE FLORISSA PASTORELLA EUPHELIA LAURINDA and FLORELLA at a little Distance  URANIA FLORA and ELIZA come out of the Cottage  URANIA  YE tender objects of maternal love  Ye dearest joys URANIA e'er can prove  Behold another blessed morn arise  Behold the Sun all glorious mount the skies  Say can you see this animating sight  Without a fervent pious strong delight  Does not that Sun whose allprolific ray  Inspires each object to be light and gay  Does not that vivid pow'r teach ev'ry mind  To be as warm benevolent and kind  To burn with unremitted ardor still  Like him to execute their Maker's will  Then let us Power Supreme thy will adore  Invoke thy mercies and proclaim thy pow'r  Shalt thou these benefits in  vain  bestow  Shall we forget the source from whence they flow  Teach us thro' these to lift ourselves to Thee  And in the gift the bounteous Giver see  To view Thee as thou art all good and wise  Nor let thy blessings hide Thee from our eyes  From all obstructions clear our mental sight  Pour on our souls thy beatific light  Teach us thy wondrous goodness to revere  With love to worship and with rev'rence fear  In the  mild  works of thy  benignant  hand  As in the  thunder  of thy dread command  In  common  objects we neglect thy pow'r  Nor find a miracle in ev'ry flow'r  Yet neither hurricanes nor storms proclaim  In  louder  language thy Almighty Name  Tell me my first my last my darling care  If you this morn have rais'd your hearts in pray'r  Say did you rise from the sweet bed of rest  Your GOD unprais'd his holy name unbless'd  FLORA  With pious thoughts with holiest notions fraught  By those pure precepts you have ever taught  By great example more than precept strong  Of pray'r and praise we've tun'd our matin song  ELIZA  And now we come with duteous joy t' attend  Our best exemplar our maternal friend  FLORELLA  aside to the Ladies who advance  See how the goodly dame with pious art  Makes every thing a lesson to the heart  Observe th' attentive listeners how they stand  Improvement and delight go hand in hand  URANIA  But where's FLORELLA  FLORELLA  Here's the happy she  Whose dearest blessing next to Heav'n is thee  URANIA  But what are these in whose attractive mien  So sweetly blended ev'ry grace is seen  FLORISSA  Lo humbly to the earth thy servants bend  URANIA  Rise fair ones and command your willing friend  Speak my FLORELLA say the cause why here  These beauteous damsels on our plains appear  FLORELLA  Invited hither by URANIA'S fame  To seek her friendship to these shades they came  Straying alone at morning's earliest dawn  I met them wandering on the desart lawn  I courted their's nor did they shun my love  I've brought them here your piety to prove  URANIA  Tell me my fair the real reason tell  Which brings such guests to grace my lowly cell  Ask what we have to giveit is not our's  Heaven has but lent it us to make it your's  FLORISSA  Your counsel your advice is all we ask  And for URANIA that's no irksome task  'Tis HAPPINESS we seek O deign to tell  Where the coy fugitive delights to dwell  URANIA  Ah rather say where you have sought this guest  This lovely inmate of the virtuous breast  Avow the various methods you've essay'd  To court and win the bright celestial maid  But first tho' harsh the task each beauteous fair  Her taste and temper must with truth declare  EUPHELIA  Bred in the regal splendors of a court  Where pleasures dress'd in every shape resort  I tried the pow'r of pomp and costly glare  Nor ever  thought  nor ever form'd a  pray'r  In different follies every hour I spent  Reflection always on some errand sent  Without reflection whence cou'd rise content  My hours were shar'd betwixt the Park and play  And  music  serv'd to waste the tedious day  Yet  softest  airs no more with joy I heard  Soon as some  sweeter  warbler was preferr'd  The  dance  succeeded and succeeding tir'd  If some more  graceful  dancer was admir'd  No sounds but flattery ever sooth'd my ear  Ungentle truths I knew not how to bear  In drawingrooms my dull pale vigils spent  With ardor sought but found not  there  Content  The Syren mock'd me with delusive charms  I grasp'dthe shadow fled my eager arms  The scorpion  envy  goaded still my breast  Some newer beauty robb'd my soul of rest  Or if my elegance of form prevail'd  And haply her inferior graces fail'd  Yet still some cause of wretchedness I found  Some barbed shaft my shatter'd peace to wound  Perhaps her gay attire exceeded mine  When she was  finer  how could I be  fine  FLORA  Pardon my interruption beauteous maid  Can truth have prompted what you just have said  Do you believe it possible that dress  Can lessen or advance your Happiness  Or that your robes tho' splendid rich and fine  Possess intrinsic value more than mine  ELIZA  Is nature then to folly so allied  That what makes human shame makes human pride  Or moves mankind by  custom's  slavish rule  And is it  fashion  constitutes the fool  FLORISSA  Another source my melancholy draws  Th' effect's the same tho' different is the cause  I sigh'd for fame I languish'd for renown  I wou'd be prais'd caress'd admir'd and know  On daring wing my mounting spirit soar'd  And science thro' her boundless fields explor'd  I scorn'd the salique laws of pedant schools  Which chain our genius down by tasteless rules  I long'd to burst these female bonds which held  By passion prompted and by fame impell'd  To boast each various faculty of mind  Thy graces POPE with JOHNSON'S learning join'd  Like SWIFT with strongly pointed ridicule  To brand the villain and abash the fool  To judge with taste with spirit to compose  Now mount in epic now descend to prose  Steal flow'rs from BURKE at once  sublime  and  sweet  From MASON numbers and from COLMAN wit  Thy talents MELMOTH HUME thy polish'd page  All HAMMOND'S softness and all DRYDEN'S rage  I pin'd for passion sentiment and stile  To weep with OTWAY and with GOLDSMITH smile  With poignant STERNE now laugh the hours away  Or court the muse of elegy with GRAY  With LANGHORNE fancy's fairy walks to range  And please like LANGHORNE howsoe'er I change  Abstruser  studies soon my fancy caught  The poet in th' astronomer forgot  NEWTON and LEIBNITZ now my thoughts inspir'd  And  numbers  less than  calculations  fir'd  DESCARTES and EUCLID shar'd my varying breast  And plans and problems all my soul possess'd  Less pleas'd to sing inspiring Phoebus' ray  Than mark the flaming comet's devious way  The pale moon dancing on the silver stream  And the mild lustre of her trembling beam  No more cou'd charm my philosophic pride  Which sought her influence on the flowing tide  No more cou'd sylvan beauties strike my thought  Which only facts and demonstrations sought  "Let common eyes I said with transport view  "The earth's bright verdure or the heav'n's soft blue  "False is the pleasure the delight is vain  "Colours exist but in the  vulgar  brain"  I now with LOCKE trod  metaphysic  soil  And search'd the  microscopic  world with BOYLE  Sigh'd for their fame but fear'd to share their toil  The laurel wreath in fond idea twin'd  To grace my learned temples I design'd  These were my notions these my constant themes  My daily longings and my nightly dreams  The idol fame my bosom robb'd of rest  Too small the mansion for so great a guest  PASTORELLA  To me no joys cou'd pomp or fame impart  Far softer thoughts possess'd my virgin heart  No prudent parent form'd my ductile youth  Nor pointed out the lovely paths of truth  Left to myself to cultivate my mind  Pernicious  novels  their soft entrance find  Their pois'nous influence led my mind astray  I sigh'd for something what I cou'd not say  I died for heroes who have never been  And fancied virtues which were never seen  I sicken'd with disgust at sober sense  And loath'd the pleasures worth and truth dispense  Contemn'd the manners of the world I saw  Fiction my nature and romance my law  Strange images my wand'ring fancy fill  Each wind a zephyr and each brook a rill  I found adventures in each common tale  And talk'd and sigh'd to ev'ry passing gale  Convers'd with echoes woods and shades and bow'rs  Cascades and grottoes fields and streams and flow'rs  Folly within my heart her empire found  My passions floating and my judgment drown'd  Reason perverted fancy on her throne  My soul to all my sexes softness prone  I neither spoke nor look'd as mortal ought  By sense abandon'd and by fancy taught  A victim to imagination's sway  Which stole my health and rest and peace away  Professions void of meaning I receiv'd  And still I found them falseand still believ'd  Imagin'd all who courted me approv'd  Who prais'd esteem'd me and who flatter'd lov'd  Fondly I hop'd now vain those hopes appear  Each man was faithful and each maid sincere  Still disappointment mock'd the lingering day  Still newborn wishes kept my soul in play  When in the rolling year no joy I find  I trust the  next  the  next  will sure be kind  The next fallacious as the  last  appears  And sends me on to still  remoter  years  They comethey promise but forget to give  I  live  not but I still  intend  to live  At length deceiv'd in all my schemes of bliss  I join'd these three in search of Happiness  ELIZA  Is this the world of which we want a sight  Are these the beings who are call'd polite  FLORA  If so oh gracious Heav'n hear FLORA'S pray'r  Preserve me still in humble virtue here  Far from such baneful pleasures may I live  And keep O keep me from the taint they give  LAURINDA  'Till now I've slept on life's tumultuous tide  No principle of action for my guide  From  ignorance  my chief misfortunes flow  I never wish'd to learn or car'd to know  With ev'ry folly slowpac'd time beguil'd  In size a woman but in soul a child  In slothful ease my moments crept away  And busy trifles fill'd the tedious day  I liv'd extempore as fancy fir'd  As chance directed or caprice inspir'd  Too indolent to think too weak to chuse  Too soft to blame too gentle to refuse  I took my colouring from the world around  The figures they my mind the simple ground  Fashion with monstrous forms the canvas stain'd  'Till nothing of my genuine self remain'd  My pliant soul from chance receiv'd it's bent  And neither good perform'd or evil meant  From right to wrong from vice to virtue thrown  No character possessing of it's own  Tho' not by nature to a vice inclin'd  A drear vacuity possess'd my mind  Too old to be with infant sports amus'd  Unfit for converse and to books unus'd  The wise avoided me they cou'd not hear  My senseless prattle with a patient ear  Disgusted restless every plan amiss  I come with these in search of Happiness  FLORISSA  United thus by some uncommon fate  Resolv'd on virtue if not yet too late  We form'd a friendship which thro' life shall last  And vows and choice and love have bound it fast  We laid our elegant attire aside  EUPHELIA  EUPHELIA thought it hard to put off pride  PASTORELLA  Each left her title and exchang'd her name  FLORISSA  An act FLORISSA hopes will merit fame  URANIA  Your candor beauteous damsels I approve  Your foibles pity and your merits love  How few O sacred virtue can acquire  That heartfelt transport thy pure flames inspire  But ere I say the methods you must try  To gain the glorious prize for which you sigh  Your fainting strength and spirits must be cheer'd  With a plain meal by temperance prepar'd  FLORELLA  No luxury our humble board attends  But love and concord are it's smiling friends    They retire into the cottage    End of the Second DIALOGUE  DIALOGUE III  SCENE the Inside of the COTTAGE A RURAL ENTERTAINMENT  URANIA FLORA ELIZA FLORELLA PASTORELLA EUPHELIA FLORISSA LAURINDA  During the Repast FLORELLA sings the following SONG  I  HOW kind is that pow'r who has first sent us meat  And then has with appetites bless'd us to eat  Let the rich and the great and the vain and the gay  Still ridicule wisdom and all she can say  II  In beautiful  nature  no charm can they find  The pleasures  they  follow a sting leave behind  Can criminal passion enrapture the breast  Like virtue protected or innocence bless'd  III  O wou'd you ye great ones her impulse attend  No longer at luxury's shrine would you bend  Our mornings are cheerful our labors are bless'd  Our ev'nings are pleasant our nights crown'd with rest  IV  Our water is drawn from the clearest of springs  And our fruits are as ripe as your's or your King's  Of how little use then to us were your wealth  When without it we purchase both pleasure and health  They rise and come forward  URANIA  Thus pass the tranquil hours of rural ease  Where life is bliss and pleasures truly please  LAURINDA  With joy we view the dangers we have past  Assur'd we've found  felicity  at last  FLORELLA  I weep to think how greatly you mistake  But youth will ever rash conclusions make  Judge no man happy by his  outward  air  All may  within  be bitterness and care  Tho' the full heart with agony be rent  Prudence will wear the semblance of content  Seclude it's anguish from the public sight  And feed on sorrow with a sad delight  Fly ev'ry eye to cherish darling grief  This fond indulgence it's supreme relief  To shew  contentment  treads not human ground  Nor can in any state of life be found  Know that URANIA that accomplish'd fair  Whose virtues make her Heav'n's peculiar care  Ev'n she who merits every joy to know  Hath deeply drain'd the bitter cup of woe  With those sad eyes she weeps a husband dead  With those poor hands she earns her infants bread  In affluence born and bred in splendid state  She feels the cruellest extreme of fate  Yet noble and superior to distress  She knows the hand which wounds hath pow'r to bless  Instead of murmuring at his sacred will  Grateful she bows for what he leaves her still  Remembers  Who  to erring man did spare  One SON exempt from  sin  but none from  care  PASTORELLA  Blest be that pow'r divine who brought us here  URANIA  Dear to my arms and to my heart most dear  Of all the various evils which infest  The human mind and rob it of it's rest  Our highest happiness and heaviest woe  From good or evil  education  flow  And hence our future dispositions rise  The ill we fly from or the good we prize  Mistaken damsels cou'd you hope for bliss  The slaves of errors you yourselves confess  EUPHELIA sighs for  flattery dress  and  show  The too too common source of  female  woe  In beauty's sphere preeminence to find  She slights the great improvements of the mind  I would not rail at  beauty's  charming pow'r  I would but have her aim at something more  Beauty with reason need not quite dispense  And coral lips may sure speak common sense  Beauty makes virtue most divinely rare  Virtue makes beauty more than mortal fair  Confirms it's conquest o'er the yielding mind  And those your  beauties  gain your  virtues  bind  Wou'd you ye fair the bright example give  Fir'd with ambition  men  like you wou'd live  Wou'd chuse for merit and esteem for sense  And taste the solid transports these dispense  No more wou'd rakes disdain the shackled life  Nor scorn that poor neglected thinga wife  But shunning each delusive path of sin  All joy without all sweet content within  Wou'd rouse at virtue's and at honor's voice  And  love  from  reason  whom they  lik'd  from  choice  Then marriage wou'd with peace go hand in hand  And Concord's temple close to Hymen's stand  Each might be bless'd wou'd each in turn submit  Nor  man  affect  controul  nor  woman wit  Discord begun how seldom does it cease  'Tis the first difference breaks the chain of peace  Abhor beginningsalways dread the worst  Admit a doubt and you're compleatly curst  'Tis  follies  more than  vices  that destroy  Not sin but weakness taints the nuptial joy  Let  woman  then her real good discern  And her true interests of URANIA learn  Her lowest namethe tyrant of an hour  And her best empire negligence of pow'r  By yielding she obtains the noblest sway  And reigns despotic when she seems t' obey  EUPHELIA  I find how those mistake the way to bliss  Who in  externals  look for Happiness  Tutor'd by thee no more the men shall find  The pow'r of flattery o'er EUPHELIA'S mind  'Tis the weak avenue th' unguarded part  Which lets in vice directly to the heart  URANIA  I pity PASTORELLA'S hapless fate  By nature gentle generous mild yet great  One false propension all her pow'rs confin'd  And chain'd her finer faculties of mind  How all the virtues might have triumph'd there  With early culture and  maternal  care  If  good  we plant not  vice  will fill the mind  And  weeds  despoil the space for  flow'r's  design'd  The human heart ne'er knows a state of rest  From bad to worse from better on to best  We either gain or lose we sink or rise  Nor rests poor struggling nature 'till she dies  'Tis the disease most fatal to the soul  To stop the race before we've reach'd the goal  For nought our farther progress can preclude  So much as thinking we're  already  good  Then place the standard of fair virtue high  Pursue and grasp it e'en beyond the sky  PASTORELLA  I mourn the errors of my thoughtless youth  And long with thee to tread the paths of truth  URANIA  Learning is all the fair FLORISSA'S aim  She seeks the loftiest pinnacle of fame  Wou'd she the priviledge of  man  invade  Learning for female minds was never made  Taste elegance  and  talents  may be our's  But  learning  suits not our less vigorous pow'rs  Learning  but roughens polish'd  taste  refines  Dacier  less lovely than  SÃ©vignÃ©  shines  Know fair aspirer cou'd you even hope  To speak like STONHOUSE or to write like POPE  To join like FERNEY'S or like HAGLEY'S sage  Th'  historic ethic  and  poetic  page  With all the pow'rs of wit and judgment fraught  The flow of stile and the sublime of thought  Yet if the milder graces of the mind  Graces peculiar to the  sex  design'd  Goodnature patience sweetness void of art  If these embellish'd not your virgin heart  You might be  dazzling  but not truly  bright  A pompous glare but not an useful light  A  meteor  not a  star  you wou'd appear  For  woman  shines but in her proper sphere  As some fair violet loveliest of the glade  Sheds it's soft perfumes on the lonely shade  Withdraws it's modest head from public sight  Nor courts the sun nor seeks the glare of light  Shou'd some rude hand prophanely dare intrude  And bear it's beauties from it's native wood  Expos'd abroad it's languid colours fly  It's form decays and all it's odors die  So  woman  born to dignify retreat  Unknown to flourish and unseen be great  To give domestic life it's sweetest charm  With softness polish and with virtue warm  Fearful of fame unwilling to be known  Shou'd seek but Heav'ns applauses and her own  No censures dread but those which crimes impart  The censures of a selfcondemning heart  With Angelkindness shou'd behold distress  And meekly  pity  where she can't  redress  Like beaming  mercy  wipe affliction's tear  But to herself not  justice  so severe  Her passions all corrected or subdu'd  But one the virtuous thirst of doing good  This great ambition still she calls her own  This best ambition makes her breast it's throne  FLORISSA  Confus'd with shame to thy reproofs I bend  Thou best adviser and thou truest friend  From thee I'll learn to judge and act aright  Humility  with  reading  to unite  The finish'd character must  both  combine  The  perfect woman  must in  either  shine  URANIA  LAURINDA'S dark untutor'd mind may shew  What ills from want of  education  flow  Wisdom and virtue no dominion keep  O'er passions not rein'din but fast asleep  Passions are treasures if they're manag'd right  And make the lamp of reason burn more bright  How growing virtues fortify by time  And how illhabits strengthen into crime  Those squander'd hours which nothing can replace  Might have enrich'd her soul with ev'ry grace  Accomplishments by Heav'n were first design'd  Less to  adorn  than to  amend  the mind  Each should contribute to this gen'ral end  And all to virtue as their centre tend  Th' acquirements which our best esteem invite  Should not  project  but soften mix unite  In glaring  light  not strongly be display'd  But sweetly lost and melted into  shade  LAURINDA  O that important time cou'd back return  LAURINDA then shou'd have no cause to mourn  Accept just Heav'n my penitence sincere  My heartfelt anguish and my fervent pray'r  URANIA  FLORELLA shines with more than human grace  Her heart all goodness as all charms her face  Reason in  her  to pure religion tends  Subservient only to the noblest ends  True piety's the magnet of the soul  Which upwards points immortal bliss the pole  Above the wretched and below the great  Kind Heav'n has plac'd her in a midd'ling state  From rich and poor at equal distance thrown  The smile invidious and th' insulting frown  The  Demon fashion  never warp'd her soul  Her passions move at  reason's  wise controul  Her eyes the movements of her heart declare  For what she dares to  be  she dares  appear  Unlectur'd in dissimulation's school  To smile by  precept  and to blush by  rule  No pain she knows for  guilt  she never knew  To friendship faithful and to honor true  She smooths the path of my declining years  And looks with me beyond this vale of tears  Her thoughts are rational her virtue pure  A virtuous mind is Happiness secure  No  accident  can ever make it less  Nor any  outward  circumstance increase  CONTENT alone in VIRTUE we can find  And HAPPINESS exists but in the MIND  FLORISSA  Let's join to bless that pow'r who brought us here  Adore His goodness and His will revere  Assur'd that  health content  and  peace  of  mind  Are all the  blessings man  on  earth  can find  FLORELLA and a Chorus of Nymphs sing this SONG  WHILST beauty and pleasure are now in their prime  And folly and fashion expect our whole time  Ah let not these phantoms our wishes engage  Let us live so in youth that we blush not in age  Let us try to get charms which will never decay  Nor listen to all that deceivers can say  How the tints of the rose and the jess'mine's persume  The eglantine's fragrance the lilac's gay bloom  Tho' fair and tho' fragrant unheeded may lie  For that neither is sweet when FLORELLA is by  I sigh not for beauty nor lauguish for wealth  But grant me kind Providence virtue and health  Then richer than Kings yes and proud too as they  My days shall pass sweetly and swiftly away  For when time shall admonish that youth is no more  And age wrinkled age threatens loud at my door  What charm then in beauty or wealth shou'd I find  My treasure my wealth is a sweet peace of mind  Reflexion's a Heav'n which on earth we enjoy  To look forward is transport and backward is joy  Thus virtue and wisdom shall warm the cold scene  And sixty shall flourish as gay as sixteen  And when long I the burthen of life shall have borne  And death with his sickle shall cut the ripe corn  Resign'd to my fate without murmur or sigh  I'll bless the kind summons and lie down and die  URANIA  Now strike with sprightly airs the violin  And Virgins now the festive dance begin    Music and a rural Dance    THE END  PROLOGUE to HAMLET Spoken by the late Mr POWELL on his BenefitNight at the Theatre at  Jacob'sWell  in  WHEN genius flourish'd and when SHAKESPEARE wrote  When  Plays  nor wanted wit nor  Prologues  thought  Phoebus to crown a merit so confess'd  Decreed this boon to make his darling bless'd  Two beauteous daughters of immortal JOVE  Enchanting virgins form'd alone for love  He brought and both beside the Poet plac'd  Who  each  admir'd and  each  by turns embrac'd  He knew not which to leave nor which to chuse  This was the Comic that the Tragic Muse  Now Comedy blithe buxom debonair  Seem'd all his wish ambition pride and care  Then sweet MELPOMENE his soul possess'd  She  was the gentlest softest loveliest best  To strains harmonious each attunes her lyre  With solemn sweetness or with living fire  Perplex'dthe charm'd divided Poet stood  Transported lostalternately subdued  Phoebus the wav'ring of his soul descried  And pass'd his leave to make  each  fair his bride  The Godstrange sentence 'tho' 'twas giv'n on high  For this one time allow'd  Polygamy  Th' enraptur'd bard unites each jarring wife  And wondrous tale adores them both for life  Tonight for  your  applause  my  dearest fame  I bring an offspring of the  Tragic  Dame  No thundering hero angry JOVE defies  Nor impious lover storms against the skies  To draw the gen'rous sympathetic tear  The  filial virtues  shall tonight appear  A flame so holy and so chaste a zeal  As Heav'n might look on or as Saints might feel  Beauties on beauties strike the dazzled eyes  New beauties still on former beauties rise  Oh nature whence this pow'rful magic sway  That from our bosoms steals our souls away  If to draw characters most justly bright  To contrast light with shade and shade with light  To trace up passions to their inmost source  And greatly paint them with uncommon force  If these obedient still to nature's laws  Excite our wonder and exact applause  Be these immortal SHAKESPEARE ever thine  To feel to praise and to adore them  mine  Engrave thy genuine feelings on this breast  Be all my bosom with thy stamp impress'd  Pardon this tribute  Weeps  nature will have way  To SHAKESPEARE  nature  must her tribute pay  Nor think presumption claims too large a part  If I aspire to boast a grateful heart  Oh gratitude thou deity confess'd  Thou angel passion in a human breast  Forgive if dearer to my soul than fame  I steal one ray of thy celestial flame  With honest transport bring the spark divine  And offer it as incense at this shrine  To the Audience  A PROLOGUE Spoken at the Theatre in  Kingstreet Bristol  by the late Mr POWELL to the Tragedy of KING LEAR to introduce Mrs POWELL who appeared in the Part of CORDELIA  WITH grateful joy with honest pride elate  See a Triumvir  The Theatre was conducted by three Managers of which Mr POWELL was one  of our little state  In ancient  Rome  by custom 'twas decreed  That civic crowns shou'd be the victor's meed  Let victor's wear the gift of public laws    My  noblest civic crown is  your  applause  Thou at whose shrine we nightly sacrifice  Thou God of pathos soul of SHAKESPEARE rise  Teach me thy melting thy persuasive art  To wake the tenderest feelings of the heart  Blush not ye good ye grave to shed a tear  It falls from  virtue  if it falls for LEAR  No wild licentious picture shall excite  The kindly dewdrops of your eyes tonight  By no false colouring drawn no lawless plan  'Tis not the KING demands them'tis the MAN  Let meaner bards uncertain of success  Cloath their thin thoughts in all the pomp of dress  When mighty Kings appear let meaner bards  Place royalty in trappings state and guards  Our SHAKESPEARE scorns such paltry futile arts  He  whilst he charms you meliorates your hearts  Rouses each nobler feeling of the mind  His volume  nature  and his theme  mankind  For this eternal honors grace his name  And neverdying laurels crown his same  The hoary monarch of tonight aspires  To kindle  pity's  lamp at  nature's  fires  Weakness and passion tenderness and rage  The fire of youth the frowardness of age  With filial cruelty's acutest sting  Rend the sad bosom of a wretched King  Unworthy 'till by crushing woes distress'd  Greatest when fall'n and noblest when oppress'd  Now let me trembling lift an anxious eye  And touch each chord of soft humanity  Let me in each kind face read sweet applause  Whilst I presume to plead a  woman's  cause  Tonightthe  second  aera of my life  I venture here my  pupil  moremy  wife  Imagine all her doubts and all her fears  Her soft alarms her apprehensive tears  No sanguine hope her aching bosom fires  No fancied fame her timid soul inspires  Indulge her with the sunshine of  your  praise  A frown wou'd kill her as a smile cou'd raise  The fearful blossom will with joy expand  If kindly nurtur'd by your fost'ring hand  Come then CORDELIA come for sages tell  'Tis worthy praise but to  endeavour  well  Thus hand in hand to the same point we'll tend  Nature our  means  morality our  end  If modest hope be crown'd if sweet success  Her humble wish her rising efforts bless  She'll think'twas  here  her trembling steps first mov'd  And be more grateful as she's more approv'd  You  she'll esteem her friends her fame her fate  And from this hour her future fortunes date  Then sinile propitious smile and make for life  One grateful  Husband  and one happy  Wife
