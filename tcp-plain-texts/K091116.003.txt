languor of the faintings gave place to reflection I found myself in my own bed whither I understood I had been conveyed by the orders of Lord Arlington as soon as the wound was staunchedhis proved so slight that it left him no pretence for apprehension Eagerly I enquired for Lady Pembroke when to my inexpressible rage and astonishment I was informed she had been turned from my door whither friendship led her to venture a repulse  The immaculate character of that admirable woman I thought even Lord Arlington would have respected but without deigning to inform himself of the real circumstances of the unforeseen interview he had so dreadfully interrupted by this rude implication he treated two of the most estimable and distinguished persons in the kingdom as abettors if not contrivers of his dishonorThe little blood left in my veins turned to gall at the idea I watched an opportunity to tear away the bandages and disdainfully resigning myself to a premature fate endeavoured to forget the generous hearts this rash action would pierceThe awful God whose justice I thus questioned still extended to me his mercymy dangerous situation was discovered in time by my careful attendants who infinitely more attached to me than their Lord used every means to prolong the life he perhaps wished at its period  In the cruel state of mind which dictated this desperate resolution it proved  a melancholy advantage as the injury now fell on my constitution only and my intellects escaped It was many months ere I had strength to cross a room or spirts to venture a questionduring this memorable interval I called together every enfeebled power and placing my conscience as umpire between myself and Lord Arlington fixed and ascertained the rights of either Convicted even by my own heart of imprudence I wondered not he construed error into guilt and while thus cool offered him every vindication of my innocence he could reasonably desire but Lord Arlington was the slave of passion and caprice and not having firmness of soul to form or fix a judgment followed through years with invincible obstinacy the impression of the first momentFrom this period he ever treated me as an artful woman whos e licentious conduct had obliged him to risque his life in vain defence of that honor already sullied and lost in my  person nor did he affect to assert his legal rights from any other reason than to separate me from Lord Essex This conduct and the misrepresentations of Lady Essex blazed the fatal incident throughout the Court and fixed a stain on my character time could never erasehappily that stain reached not my person or my heart and an injustice so aggravating on the part of Lord Arlington entitled me to forgive the little error in myself which occasioned it  In this conjuncture I once more turned my tearful eyes every way around in search of a protector to interfere between me and a fate alike unmerited and severeAlas there was not a human being virtue allowed me to call to my aid and I exercised the faculties Heaven had so unexpectedly blessed me with by resolving to suffer with patience  Elizabeth Vernon our old companion the fair and gentle cousin of Lord Essex resolved if possible to see meshe addressed  Lord Arlington and demanded that privilege the favor she held with the Queen hindered him from denying a request he granted with the utmost reluctance That sweet girl bathed me in the tears of innocence and affectionshe told me the fear lest his presence should incense Lord Arlington to further brutality had induced Essex when I lost my senses to withdraw from a scene which rent his very heartthe same reason still obliged him to remain at a distanceThat during the long and dire uncertainty attending my illness he had scarcely breathedhis own soul continually told him how pure mine was Fancy presented me to him forever pale speechless expiring my sad eyes rivetted on his with a tenderness death itself could not extinguish however guiltless of my blood every drop which oozed from my veins seemed to congeal on his heart in fine that almost deified by my sufferings and his sense of them I reigned alone in his affections which were from this moment  consecrated to me by a most convincing proof Having used the utmost art and diligence to discover how Lord Arlington so soon became apprized of his secret return to England and a meeting so unplanned and sudden as to interrupt it almost immediately though supposed to be as far off as Greenwich Lord Essex learnt that his Master of the Horse being among the domestics he brought with him to Pembroke House had quitted it as soon as he alighted and hastened to Greenwich in search of a girl attending on Lady Essex of whom he was enamored through her means her Lady became likewise acquainted with his secret arrival without knowing its motive That suspicious woman had already remarked Lord Arlington was among the bridal train and in his hearing published the return of her Lord with all her own injurious surmisesill fortune for once had given them the colour of truth and Lord Arlington needed no more than the hint to make him mount the swiftest horse and  fly to satisfy himselfLady Essex was quickly informed of an incident she ought to have foreseen and giving way to another extravagance passionately conjured every friend she met to follow and prevent the conflict to which her Lord now stood exposedbut when could friendship keep pace with love and vengeance The straggling mediators arrived only time enough to witness the event no human power could guard against Incensed beyond all bounds at the conduct of his Lady the rash Essex took the only step wanting to my ruin Determined to make her share the misery she had occasioned he parted with her at once and foreverin vain were all her subsequent vows of sorrow and repentancein vain had she from that moment indulged hopes of his cooling and conciliatinghis temper till this fatal period no less yielding than fiery now assumed a cold and philosophic sternness in fine that the grief and disappointment to which Lady Essex resigned herself would severely punish her  unjust suspicions and ere long release her Lord from the illjudged bondage he had hitherto groaned so impatiently under"  The fair Elizabeth thus ended her recital which was so clear concise and affecting that I could not avoid taxing her with being the emissary of her cousin her blushes acquitted her and bespoke a secret time soon explained She was secretly beloved by the gallant Southampton that heroic friend who was only less attached to Essex than myself and from him had learnt the various particulars public report could not apprise her ofI held myself infinitely indebted to her friendship and through her means sent that farewell to Lady Pembroke I was not allowed to pronounce  It had been but too obvious through her whole recital that I was totally the victim of calumny nor could any human power now justify meI had been found in the arms of Essexthe fact was indubitable the true cause of that fatal impulse not likely to be credited even when repeated  My youth my wound and my past conduct blended the rash judgment of the many with compassion but the most liberalminded ventured not to acquit me Those impassioned vindications the conscious soul of Essex offered were always considered as a mere point of honor in him and no less necessary to his own justification than mine and thus only served to stamp guilt on bothOh misjudging world how severely on the most superficial observation dost thou venture to decidelet the barbed arrow of misfortune rest in the bosom it has wounded nor by inhumanly tearing it out to discover whence it came rack the heart already broken  Defamed dejected and forgotten by all but the generous sisters of the Sydney family I followed once more my fate in Lord Arlington and reached again that Abbey destined alike to entomb me in playful childhood and in blasted youththe same imperious will which had destroyed me had deprived that venerable mansion of its sweet its solitary charmsthe  hallowed spot where once the ivied trophies of time bound up the defaced ones of religion presented nothing now but a bare and barren level and the lofty woods which so long protected alike the living and the dead had wholly given place to infant plantations through the thinness of which the weary eye every where pierced I turned with disgust from the desolated scene and locking myself up in the remotest and most gloomy chamber of the Abbey spent my life in meditating on my every loss  Lord Arlington now valuing me only as the appendage of his pride consoled himself for my undissembled aversion and cared not what employed me provided I was yet his legal prisonerAlas I had no longer resolution to rest my hopes on any objectto form any subordinate design or to reap any subordinate pleasure The poor children still supported by my bounty no more touched the Jute in my presencethat over which my own fingers once wandered with the wild elegance of untried youth  now useless and unstrung hung up an emblem of the discordant soul of its owner Taste genius and science those rich columes with which enthusiastic fancy erects in peaceful minds a thousand light aerial structures deep sunk and broken in my heart presented to the mental eye a ruin more terrible than the noblest speculation ever paused overMisanthropy blackvisaged misanthropy reigned there like a solitary savage unconscious of the value of those treasures his rude hand every day more and more defaced  I was roused one night with the information that a favorite servant of Lord Arlington's who had long languished in a consumption now found himself at the point of death and importunately demanded to speak with mebut illdisposed at this season even to the gentle offices of humanity and convinced he could have nothing to impart I should think of consequence I rejected the request but finding his Lord was inebriated beyond the power of comprehending  him on being again sollicited I rose and accompanied by a maid who loved me entered the sick man's chamberI cast a harsh and cold glance round and hardly heard the thanks he gave mehaving dismissed all the servants except the maid I mentioned I prepared to listen to him imagining some matter relative to his office of chief bailiff and surveyor alone could thus disturb his last hours"Lady said he in the hollow broken voice of approaching dissolution I could not have departed in peace had you not bestowed this indulgencepardon me I beseech you for proposing to my Lord the destruction of those ruins I have since seen too plainly your heart was ever wrapt inalas that proposal costs me my lifeCondescend too to listen to a secret which continually drags back my soul when striving to quit her dungeonmy crime perhaps brings with it a sufficient punishmentIn removing the rubbish of the artificial hermit's cell in compliance with the directions of my Lord I one day saw a common laborer turn up  something which tried his whole strength when casting a quick and fearful glance around he covered it with earth I dispatched the men in hearing to another part and seizing the arm of him I had watched I insisted on seeing what he had endeavoured to concealit proved to be a small iron chest strongly fastenedI agreed with him to convey it away till the evening when he might rejoin me and we would open it and divide the contents together He yielded rather to necessity than choice and I took the casket with a purpose God has severely punishedthe many keys intrusted to my care supplied one which immediately opened it under a number of papers and trifles of no value I found a large sum in gold and a few jewelsas I knew my partner in the discovery had remarked that the chest was heavy in the room of the gold and jewels I substituted an iron crucifix and many rusty keys then locking the casket waited anxiously for the evening The poor laborer seeing me return wistfully examined my features  but not daring to express the doubt visible in his own expected in silence the deciding hour I suffered him to take infinite pains to break open a chest I was conscious would not repay the laborgreat was the poor wretch's disappointment when he emptied itI affected the same chagrin but turning over the papers I offered to give him twenty nobles a sure proof had he reflected a single moment that I must have wronged him he readily accepted this proposal and at my desire promised never to mention the incident then with much apparent gratitude departed Eagerly I replaced my guilty gains and secretly resolved to take an early opportunity of quitting my Lord to commence builder in London but fear did not suffer me for a time to venture this measure alas I have wanted health since to do any thingfrom this moment peace appetite and rest have fled meif worn out with watching I dropt into a slumber the idea that my treasure was stolen has made me often start up and regardless of the cold sweat  the mere apprehension has produced I have flown in the dead of night to convince myself it was safeimaginary whispers have ever been near my bed and uncertain forms have glided through my chamberthe dawn of day never gave me relief every eye seemed to dive into my secret and every hand to be intent on impoverishing mein a word Lady to this sad moment it has prematurely brought me for many months doubtful whether I should survive I have been considering how to bestow that wealth I could no longer hope to enjoythe poor man I so basely defrauded of it perished a short time after by the fall of a pillar and restitution to him can never be made It came into my head this evening that you were said to have been brought up in these ruins certainly I had often seen you walk and weep on the very spot where this chest was found perhaps in giving it to you I only restore it to the right owner accept it Madam and swear you will never discover the gift to my Lord"This request appeared a  needless injunction if the treasure had not been obtained by defrauding Lord Arlington and though perhaps I should have been silent through choice I thought it beneath me to engage to be sofinding me pause he continued "fear not any ill design in this request Madam you will one day be glad you complied with it and for your own sake alone is it proposed the hand of my Lord is grudgingyours bounteous as that of heavenDo not rob yourself of the means to be liberal which now are offered to youyet on no other condition than the vow of silence will I give it up" A strange desire to examine the papers more than any I felt for the money made me at last acquiesce My maid by his direction drew the iron chest from an obscure corner and emptied it of both gold jewels and papers which she and I divided and with some difficulty concealed till we reached my apartmenthe seemed only to have lived to make this discovery and a few hours after expiated his sin with his life  While he strove to impress my mind with the necessity of concealing the adventure I pondered deeply over it not easily discerning how I should interpret this strange ordination of providence it at last occurred to me the treasure might be put into my hands for the assistance and comfort of my sisterhow did I know whether she was not even then hastening towards me perhaps impoverished certainly distressedOh how consolatory should I find it to minister to her external wants though those of her heart should be beyond my power of comforting The contempt I felt for Lord Arlington was rooted too deep to admit of my thus applying his fortune had I been the unlimited mistress of it I therefore saw a degree of wisdom and propriety in receiving and secreting a gift heaven seemed so strangely to put into my hands as if it were to forerun some yet unknown incident  The papers consisted chiefly of the correspondence between Mrs Marlow and  Father Anthony while yet they were lovers and after the cruel discovery which annulled the nominal unionI perused these invaluable epistles with pulsations of tenderness I lately thought myself incapable of they recalled me to life and sensibility and I gathered fortitude from those who now were dust I raised my eyes to heaven in search of their pure translated souls and wandering from planet to planet fancied there must be one peculiarly allotted to lovers now no longer unhappyA thousand trifles whose value must ever be ideal and local were preserved with these letters cyphers hair sonnets dear perpetuators of those bright hours of youth we look back on with pleasure to the latest moment of decaying life I kissed the innocent reliques of such an unhappy attachment with devout regard and held them not the least part of my legacy  Time dissipated the flattering illusion which led me to expect my sistermy mind sunk into its usual inertitude  and the acquisition remained if not forgotten at least neglected  From this profound stupor I was at last roused as by an earthquakeLord Arlington in hunting fell from his horse and breaking some bloodvessel was brought home to appearance lifelessconscience and humanity called on me to forget my injuries I made every effort to save him and for a time he appeared to mend but the incurable habit of inebriety he even at this period indulged defeated both care and medicine and after enduring a series of sufferings which annihilated my sense of wrong he expired in the prime of his days  Good heaven what a transition did this event make in my lifehabituated to slaveryaccustomed to suppose Lord Arlington destined to survive me I beheld this incredible revolution with mute surprisethe horror of his sufferings gave way when they ceased to the sweet idea of libertyliberty sighed out my weary heart ah to what purpose is mine now  restored I beheld myself in the situation of a criminal whose shackles are struck off only to launch him into the immense ocean in a little boat without rudder oars or sustenancewhere could I find a hope to rest on alone in the vast universe I turned around in vain in search of one generous hand whose aid I might receive without fear or shame  The relation of Lord Arlington who succeeded to his title and estate was an illiterate rude sea officer whom his illness alone had detained in England He came on the news of his decease escorting the late Lord's two sisters to whom the personals were all devised I waited only the reading of the will to quit the melancholy mansion I meant to abjure for the futureGracious heaven how deep was my indignation and rage to find myself mentioned in it as an insane wretch to whom he bequeathed a mere maintenance and left to be confined under the charge of his sisters in St Vincent's Abbey which as a purchase of his own  descended to them Never in all the trials I had hitherto experienced had I felt a transport like that this usage excitedto extend his tyranny beyond the graveMean execrable wretch even at the moment I was exhausting the little constitution his cruelty had left me in unwearied attendance deliberately to condemn me to an imprisonment so shocking and render it perpetualhuman nature could not resist so pungent a pangit  made  the misery it punished and I sunk into the dreary gulph once more from which I was lately emergingmy brain still fires but to remember itOh my sister whatever the inflictions of your mysterious fate those of mine may surely dispute the woeful preeminence  The overjoyed Essex dispatched an express as soon as the news of Lord Arlingtons death reached the Court conjuring me to quit the melancholy prison I had so long inhabited and retire to a  seat of Lord Southampton in Herefordshire whither that nobleman's bride would immediately repair to meet and comfort me Lady Southampton was the fair cousin of Lord Essex I formerly mentioned who by marrying privately had wholly lost the favor of the Queen The declining state of Lady Essex's health he added daily promised him that freedom made doubly desirable now I had recovered mine It had always been the intention of Lady Southampton to follow her Lord to Ireland and he besought me to give him the sweet satisfaction of knowing I was safe in the company and protection of his cousin solemnly promising not to obtrude himself on me ere the laws of society authorized the avowal of those sentiments which had so long lived in his heart  The relations of Lord Arlington possessing by his will an absolute power intercepted and opened this Letterfar from pouring the balm it contained into my bleeding heart they kept the dear testimony  of an unequalled attachment and sent back the messenger with the melancholy news of my insanity and confinement but Lord Essex had been already duped and could not easily credit this information He deputed Henry Tracey a young officer much in his confidence to ascertain my real situation commanding him not to be dismissed by any other mode of conviction than being admitted into my presenceAlas ere this was resolved on resentment had again fired my bewildered brain and Lord Arlington had little to apprehend in allowing Tracey to enter my apartment Buried in a profound stupor I replied not to his questions but drawing my mourning veil over my eyes sat like a selfdevoted Persian the voluntary victim of despair The faithful Tracey still fearful of being imposed on insisted on having my picture and a lock of my hair to prove to his Lord it was indeed  myself  he had beheld in this deplorable state he obtained this request and departed  But what became of Essex when Tracey returned with this melancholy confirmationthe testimonials his confidante had brought added force to the eternal passion of his soul a thousand times he made Tracey describe the apartmentmy dressmy looksand sometimes fancying even that cautious friend had been deceived at others that the wretches in whose power I was left had for the short period Tracey was permitted to behold me stupified my senses he created a thousand delusions to counteract the fearful impression of the truth  Distracted with these ideas Lord Essex fet out for Ireland invested with absolute powers and heading an army attached to him alike by gratitude and expectationhe had not marched far ere he formed the bold resolution of committing the conduct of the troops to Lord Southampton and turning off he posted to St Vincent's Abbey determined to judge from his own senses of the state of mine he arrived there at midnight and requiring  the unwilling owners to produce me in a tone which admitted neither denial or delay they conducted him to my chambera dim lamp alone glimmered in it and closing my eyes as the stronger lights approached I waved my hand in stupid silence to have them removed The transports of grief and surprise which overcame the generous Essex at this terrible convicton threatened his own intellectsby some wonderful ordination of providence my cold and apparently uninformed heart waked at that well known voiceday broke once more upon my soul and my eyes once more opened to behold their darling object This surprizing effect of his presence would have persuaded him that reason had never deserted me had not my poor maids expressed a joy at this unexpected revolution too unfeigned to be misconstrued they intreated him to leave me time to strengthen my faculties ere he again absorbed them and he confined to  stifled exclamations and silent homage all the passion and the projects with which his bosom swelled  Alithea who had for years been my favorite attendant informed him as soon as he could be persuaded to withdraw and leave me to repose of the cruel and unjust will which by rendering me a prisoner for life had occasioned this dreadful relapse His haughty soul negligent at all times of prudence and now perhaps of propriety induced him to tell the Arlington family that he would perish ere I should again be left in their power having planted some of his most faithful domestics to guard my chamber door from every one but my own maids he retired to the apartment allotted him to meditate on the mode of proceeding least likely to endanger my newly recovered intellects  Alithea very prudently had me bled and I sunk into a sweet and sound sleep the comfort I had long most wanted I waked late the next morning with intellects  entirely clear though weak I remembered I had seen or fancied I had seen Essex Alithea imparted to me the truth and shed tears of joy to find I answered her rationallyI yielded to her intreaties in delaying till the afternoon a meeting so dear and affecting and took the medicinal cordials and other nourishment she offered me a few hours strengthened me surprizingly and I was at last allowed to receive the generous lover my soul so much desired While he poured forth the most ardent vows of unremitting affection and surveyed in tender sorrow the ravages grief and disappointment had thus early made in my wan countenance and emaciated form I beheld with surprize the advantages he had acquired in both instances his graceful flower of youth was settled into firmer manhood his fair and florid complexion sunned over by his military exploits had gained strength without losing delicacy and his eye now no less accustomed to command than charm seemed to employ its first power on all the rest of the world while  its last was solely reserved for me Ah man happy man how superior are you in the indulgence of nature blest with scientific resources with boldness and an activity unknown to more persecuted woman from your various disappointments in life ever spring forth some vigorous and blooming hope insensibly staunching those wounds in the heart through which the vital powers of the feebler sex bleed helplessly away and when relenting fortune grants your wishes with unblighted powers of enjoyment you embrace the dear bought happiness scarce conscious of the cold dewdrops your cheeks imbibe from those of her permitted too late to participate your fate  It was some days ere I dared trust myself to converse long with Essex who employed that sweet interval in amusing my mind with lighter topics while he arranged his future plans but finding I still appeared calm he ventured at last to unfold to me the mighty designs which floated in his imagination "Inexorably opposing choice to fate my dearest Ellinor  said he never from the moment I first beheld you have I formed a project in which you were not a sharer this I am about to unfold has been for years the child of my dotagecollect yourself listen without wonder and if possible approve it from the moment I knew the base arts that must have been made use of to separate us I clearly comprehended we should never unite with the consent of Elizabeth but however indebted to her partial distinction it was a point in which even she could not controul me it is not the posts or advantages I derive from her favor on which my soul values itself elevated on a more solid foundation it has taken every road to glory and I may proudly say given a grace to dotage yet as that dotage however unbecoming her years and her rank has been uniform and generous I have sworn to yield Elizabeth to the latest moment of her life every homage but that of the heart and sacrifice to my fealty all but my happinessIt is hard to reconcile duties  and inclinations so entirely opposite yet I think you will own I have done so  To a blind partiality for me and her own egregious selflove the Queen ignobly sacrificed your youth your hopes your happiness but alas she forgot in so doing that she would only make them more perfectly minewithout any consideration for the husband she had given you a wretch I could at any time look into insignificance I studied solely how to extricate you from a bondage not more insupportable to you than myselfAmong a thousand other projects I resolved to apprize the King of Scots of your existence and situation soliciting from his fraternal regard a safe asylum and that peace and protection my youth and circumstances would not allow me to offer you I found means to convey to his knowledge your whole melancholy storybut how shall I declare to you his ungenerous conduct Fool that I was to think the man who could tamely submit to the murder of his mother would be interested by any other tye Far from  exerting himself to rescue the dear unhappy sister I conjured him to compassionate he affected to disbelieve the story of his mother's marriage with the Duke of Norfolk though the Countess of Shrewsbury solemnly assured me he had through her hands received from the Royal Mary the most authentic proofs of it as soon as he escaped from the power of the Regent and was allowed to act as an independent Sovereign Anxious without doubt to center in himself every right of his mother he voluntarily renounced all regard for either her ashes or her offspring ignominiously submitting to kiss the hand which had shortened her daysWhat after this is to be hoped from the King of Scots and why should you sacrifice to a brother who disowns you those bright prospects which now dawn before you Born of the first English Peer and the Princess immediate in succession to the Thronea native of this kingdom there is only one thing wanting to establish rights from whence you may justly form the highest hopesauthentic  testimonials of these facts and that such still exist I have certain informationit is true they are dispersed among the Catholick relations and friends of Mary yet do I not despair of obtaining themThe English ever disposed to be jealous of their national rights dread the remotest chance of their annihilation and already turn their eyes toward the family of Suffolk in preference to receiving a foreign MonarchThat unhappy branch of the royal line by turns the martyrs of fear and policy have bled through succeeding generations till reduced wholly to females among whom there is not one endued with courage or talents to venture a contest had they even the priority of birth which rests with you Let us then adopt the views of Lord Leicester who certainly meant by the most watchful policy to pave the way for your sister's succession whenever Elizabeth should expire Your fate is bound up with that of a man much more capable of effecting whatever views he shall adopt  Elizabeth daily totters on the verge of the gravedisposed to hate the Prince she has irretrievably injured in the person of his mother she still refuses to acknowledge the King of Scots for her heir and has fully invested me with every power that may enable me to profit by the popularity I have honorably acquired My own birth though it does not give me a lineal claim to the Crown of England is yet noble in many generations and princely in some Circumstances and merit thus entitle me to match with youdoubt not the success of this projectBorn as you are for empire endued with beauty to adorn and majesty to dignify itwith incontestable evidence of your birth which I will employ every art to procure I will boldly present to the people of England another blooming Queenthey will with joy adopt you nor can the feeble attempts of the boyish Scotch pedant against an army won by my munificence endeared to my command and relying on my valor affect a  claim so strongly supported How many instances does our own history supply where courage and popularity have dethroned monarchs in full possession of every other advantage You now are informed of what has long been the ultimate object of my life every action and view has had a secret reference to it and far from idling away my youth in the various pleasures the gay Court of Elizabeth offered to her favorite I have continually ranged the seas watched in camps disciplined armies and by every possible means studied to increase my military fame knowledge and popularity as what must one day decide more than my own fate It is this that has made me eager to conduct the Irish warIn that country I shall be at the head of an army which will easily enable me to profit by the loss of the Queen without alarming her declining years with the appearance of cabal mystery or rebellionBoldly resolve then my love to accompany me thither as the only place on earth where  you can be entirely safe I will lodge you in some impregnable fortress with Lady Southampton I will remain in the camp and never approach it but by your permissionI demand this instance of your confidence of your love and swear in return inviolable honor and obedienceOh answer me not rashly sweet Ellinorrather recall the fatal moment of obstinate prudence which once before brought on both so tedious a period of suffering and remember you again have the power of deciding my fate and your own  Essex rose from my feet and left me absorbed in the deepest reflection my mind however instantaneously adopted the aspiring project he had presented to it Through the dark and heavy cloud which had long hung over my soul the sun of love now pierced at once and turned it all to ambient goldTo mount a throne to share it with the choice of my heart to give to him that sovereignty I owed to his valorI was astonished the idea had  so long escaped me yet such a train of misfortunes had succeeded my birth as might well obliterate my sense of its rights "Base and unworthy son sighed I ungenerous cruel brother why should I sacrifice to thee my only chance on this side the grave" The mean acquiescence of James under a blow which almost nerved my arm against the royal murderer had already sufficiently shocked my feelings and shut him out of all my plans alas I could only excuse his misconduct by supposing he was yet subjected to his mother's enemies though even then a generous soul would resolutely have protested against the evil it could not prevent but to learn he sacrificed an inviolable duty and every social feeling at the shrine of that bloated idol  self  robbed him of all claim to the feelings the duties he renounced The determined plan of the generous Essex had every thing in its favor nor was my concurrence so necessary to his success as happinessbut wherefore should I hesitate  when not to unite in it was to deliver myself up to an implacable enemy yet as avowedly to depart with Essex or even after him would awaken dangerous suspicions in the mind of Elizabeth and confirm all the slanders of the world I pondered much on a singular idea that arose in my mind by which both might be obviated indeed the situation of my health would have sufficently opposed my going with him had no other objection occurredI perceived an air of stifled anger in Essex when he returned which I conjured him to expound"It is a matter of no consequence said he with his usual frankness fortunately the few friends I have brought with me are tried and valiant and we have the power in our own hands the wretches my love who surround you pretend an authority from the Queen as well as from the late Lord Arlington for your detention this will oblige us to use a violence I had rather have avoided but that is a trifle" Oh call not any thing a trifle which affects your safety  however remotely cried I in yielding to the bold project you have ventured to form beware I do not become its ruinyes look not on me with so marked a wonder my soul accords to adopts at once all your views I will at last indulge my heart and thus affiance it to yoursborn to pursue your fortune I will joyfully consent to partake it so you in return swear the confidence will render you but more guarded in considering my own honor I am only watching over yours pledge then your word that you will not interfere with my plan and I in return will vow that all I henceforward form shall have the same tendency with your own"  The generous Essex scarce credited his senses and gave with readiness the assurance I desiredResolved to guard my sister's prior rights and unable to judge of the motives which might bury her for a time in oblivion I insisted on his supporting her claim in preference to mine if ever she should appear and he perhaps the more readily acquiesced in this request from a conviction she no  longer existed as all my opinions on that head appeared to him entirely visionary  Refusing to confide in this dear rash lover the means by which I meant to rejoin him I obliged him to assume an air of grief and despair Which persuaded the Arlington family I had relapsed into insanity In the interim a maid of mine had been seized with an epidemic fever of the most dangerous kind I impatiently hastened the departure of Essex lest the cruel malady should infect him and conjured him to wait with Lady Southampton at the Port from whence the troops had already embarked till I should rejoin him The air of satisfaction he perceived in me made him comply against his better judgment and the Arlington race no less overjoyed at his departure than my supposed relapse and fearful of the epidemic fever shut up those who immediately attended on me in the quarter of the Abbey I inhabited avoiding it themselves as though the plague were enclosed there  In this solitude I executed a surprizing project I had long meditated from the moment I was informed of the mock interment of Lord Leicester my mind had dwelt on the idea I saw it was only to methodize the most wild and romantic plan and however unfeasible it at first appeared time might form and bring it to effectThe treasure of the surveyor now became a treasure indeed reflection convinced me the bequest originated in that wretch's having been the confidante as well as witness of his Lord's ungenerous will and by thus disposing of it he enabled me to escape from the despicable bondage it entailed upon me without betraying his trustThe maid who alone witnessed the mysterious legacy had by her inviolable silence on so singular an event sufficiently proved that she could merit my whole confidence fortunately she was no less favored by those in whose power I was left and became of course the properest and only assistant I could fix onby thus turning the artifice of the Queen upon herself I might at once escape from  her power and that of the guardians under whose care she had placed me and gratify the first wish of Essex without endangering his safety  Alithea embraced the plan with joy and engaged her parents who were laborers in the neighbourhood to aid the delusionI affected to be seized with the same fatal fever as soon as the maid's symptoms became mortal and when she soon after died resigned my bed to her corpse her hair height complexion and age so far agreed with mine as to secure me from common observation and dread of the contagion saved us from a very strict scrutiny as it was believed the maid expired at the same time with myself by Alithea's judicious management her supposed body was to be delivered to the parents of that faithful domestic when placing myself and treasure in the homely coffin I was boldly conveyed like the Empress Maud through the midst of my enemies and lodged in their humble cot till enough recovered to pursue the route of Essex  Alithea now published the news of my death through the family who heard of it with joy the unguarded conduct of the generous Essex had suggested to them that to have acted under the authority of the Queen might one day be a very insufficient vindicationthis idea added fear to that hatred they always entertained for me and with pleasure they buried both those passions in my grave Having surveyed my wardrobe jewels and papers without finding the least deficiency they prepared for my interment and discharged my immediate attendants among them the favored one who had aided my scheme and her return to her parents restored peace to my bosom  From the humble cot of that honest creature's parents do I close this period of my memoirshere as from an invisible world have I surveyed the gloomy pageant with which the erroneous judgments of those from whom I escaped have dignified a lowborn female and by placing her pompously at the side of Lord Arlington they perhaps have blundered  unconsciously on proprietyAs the sable train wound by my window my soul paused on the solemn vanityOh that in thy tomb thou quiet sleeper sighed I may be interred with my name all the painful part of my existence that renovated to a new and happier being I may emerge again into that world which still opens a flowery path before me with corrected spirits unfaltering reason and a temper superior to the shocks of misfortune  The soul ever capricious and uncertain fully enjoys only the pleasures it makes for itselfOften do I seem even in this rustic asylum concealed in the coarse garments of the other sex and looking towards a distant kingdom as my home to have hoards of hope and happiness to build on my youthful healthful days were never blest with  My own fate has once more recalled to my mind that of MatildaI have meditated much on a sister so dearalas too certainly Essex is in the right and there exists not a being I can call by that nameLong years have succeeded each other and still that incomprehensible mystery that dreadful silence continues there is no circumstance but death that could occasion itFarewell then oh name ever so pleasant to my lips sink deep into my heart and remain eternally engraved therefarewell thou pure spirit too etherial for a world so gross I will no more look for thee on its surface I will no more imagine thee beneath it no I will now raise my stedfast eye to that heaven "where the wicked cease from troubling" and in some yet undiscovered star fancy I behold thee Ah deign if so to guide the uncertain steps of a wanderer and if my cruel fate conduct them still toward precipices irradiate the scene and deliver me from the dangerMy spirits are high wrought and a solemnity too exquisite for description possesses  every facultyI must steep them all in a lethargy ere I recover my equanimity  Happiness undefinable good in what shall I comprize you no I will not suppose it can be done in gold and yet how pure was the transport a little of that vile metal called into the carefurrowed countenances of Alithea's venerable parents To the earth which gave I have restored the remainder it is buried eastward under the spreading chesnut planted by Edward IVthat popular tree protected alike from the caprice of its owner and the spade of the laborer will hide it safely but oh if ever one noble heart sighs under its shade oppressed with the sting of penury may some good angel whisper "you rest on that which can fully relieve you"  All is now prepared for my flight I have refused the attendance of Alithea it will be well supplied in the remembrance  that she is happyindulgent heaven has given to  her  parents who grow old in peace and virtue a lover who knows not falsehood or ambition and a soul justly grateful for blessings beyond all valuationthe faithful creature delays the happiness of him she loves till he shall have conveyed this broken narrative into the hands of Lady Pembroke nor do I fear to trust him with itDear noble friend once more my soul fondly salutes you bestow on my flight those pious prayers with which virtue consecrates our purposes and believe mine rise ever for you If we meet again remember it must be with pleasure  LADY PEMBROKE WRITES  Scarce had I recovered from the surprize and grief occasioned by the publication of this sweet creature's supposititious death ere a rustic demanded permission to see me and mysteriously delivered the wonderful packetalas how affecting did I find it  far however from drying up my tears at learning she yet lived I looked with terror on the future lest every following day should multiply or terribly finish her miseries Ah dear Matilda I cannot agree with this fair visionary who so easily adopts the romance of her loverSomething seems to assure me thou art still alive and suffering and for thy sake I will preserve these melancholy memorials alas perhaps it were truer kindness to destroy them  LETTER I  Dated Drogheda  FROM the safe shores of another kingdom once more do I greet my friendAlas ill can we judge for ourselves dear Lady Pembroke  Provided with a fleet horse I set out to follow Essex but scarce had I travelled a single day ere my shattered constitution no longer able to sustain the least toil claimed two to recover the fatigue of the first During my stay at the inn my  youth the delicacy of my person and manners with the air of reserve I found it necessary to assume excited a curiosity my liberality alone was able to bound though even that gave rise to suspicions almost equally dangerous I began to fear my scheme would wholly fail in the execution I hired however two rustics well recommended as a guide and an escort yet in travelling on the solitary mountains of Wales often dared not turn my head over my shoulder left in my guards I should behold my murderers My impaired health rendered the journey very tedious during its progress I passed for a poor youth following the steps of my father and far gone in a consumption After immense fatigue I arrived at length at the port where I understood with inexpressible chagrin that Essex had embarked for Ireland a week beforeAlas a moment's recollection enabled me to account for this apparently strange desertionin my eagerness to conceal my favorite scheme I had forgot to guard  against the chance of my Lord's being informed of my supposed death ere I reached him On enquiry I plainly perceived he had left spies in the neighbourhood of St Vincent's Abbey when he quitted it who misled by report had hastened after him with news of the melancholy event I learnt he had delayed crossing from time to time without giving any reason for it but on being roused by the arrival of two officers he ordered the seamen to be called in the dead of night and embarked the moment the tide favored his departure  Though this information left me only myself to reproach it did not lessen my chagrin I wandered toward the shore to meditate at leisure it was still littered with soldiers and their appendages they were indulging with ungoverned licence in drinking and riotEvery thing I beheld increased my fears of the voyage it was indeed a tremendous thought to embark with a numerous body of licentious men for an unknown country while wrapt in mystery  myself and without a protectorHow if actuated by curiosity or a less excusable motive they should guess at my sex and pry into my story perhaps even the name of their general would want influence to guard me I turned woman again and trembled at the bare idea While irresolute in what manner to dispose of my unfortunate self I observed a body of travellers approaching and understood with joy it was Lady Southampton and her train escorted by a chosen troop for whom those I had already seen waitedI blest indulgent heaven which thus relieved me from the effects of my own indiscretion and demanded to see herto see her was enough for with the penetration natural to her sex she instantly knew me and throwing her arms round my neck reproached me with a generous freedom for having retarded her journey by obliging her to wait in vain for my arrival and finally for shocking her with the fictitious story of my deathI explained to her my unguarded conduct and its motivesShe  assured me she dreaded the effect it might have on my lover as her Lord had not time to write more than that Essex was in despair for my loss nor dared he venture to leave him therefore conjured her to confide herself to the care of the officers he mentioned and follow with all expeditionThis information doubled the regret which had already seized on me but to guard against all suspicion and enquiry I resolved to retain my masculine habit and pass for one of Lady Southampton's pages till safely lodged in Ireland  We arrived here last night and found a letter from Lord Southampton lamenting the impossibility of waiting for his Lady without abandoning Essex to a grief which urged him to rashness and despair he ended with conjuring her to remain in this town till he had considered how to dispose of her safelyOh fortune fortune how unfairly do we accuse thee when folly alone has led us into errorI am more miserable than it is possible to express  Lady Southampton would fain persuade me this oversight may eventually prove lucky as it will prevent my again seeing Essex ere the death of his LadyAh what alteration can her loss make in my fate "I tell you my watchful friend you cannot love my honor more than I do his safetybetween him and me there is another bar not less insurmountableDid not my sister's marriage with a favorite of Elizabeth cost him his life Alas perhaps hers too was sacrificed"over her mysterious fate a dark veil early fell dipt perhaps in the blood of her belovedrather may I see my own veins opened than survive such a calamity nay even at this moment it has perhaps fallen on me and I may be dying in Essex while yet unconscious of my fateoh what horrors take possession of my soul at the bare ideaLady Southampton has sealed her English dispatches and I can only say adieu  LETTER II  Dated Drogheda  BOUND to this spot my generous friend and dreading all which passes beyond it hardly can my heart feel the congratulation you bestow Environed by enemies and rendered rash by despair Essex now renounces the glorious visions he possessed my imagination with and resigns himself wholly up to his commandOh that the arrow which stabs me should have been sharpened by my own handAll here is alarm uncertainty and confusionwe get and lose in the course of every day a passage to our friends nor dare we trust to that channel aught of importance Sir Coniers Clifford with a chosen body of troops was yesterday surrounded himself and half his men cut off immediatelyamong the officers was a relation of Lady Southampton's she has been weeping the whole day for himFor my own part conscious I have not a tear to bestow on common inflictions I  gather mine into my heart which feels ready to pour forth a deluge the moment one of my many fears shall be confirmedyou can form no conception of the wants the woes the horrible scenes we witnessBorn and bred in the arms of luxury and prosperity a distant war but faintly affects our minds but oh how tremendous does it appear when once we are driven into its tempestuous seatdeath ghastly death assumes a bloody variety of forms while rapine famine sickness and poverty fearfully forerun him  I have hitherto thought my sister's fate more consummately wretched than even my own but how is every evil lightened by comparisonBeloved Matilda born as you were to woe you saw but one bounded prospect of the infinitude the globe presents to us the horrors of this were unknown to youuncomforting is the pillow of her who sleeps within the sound of a drum and fancies its every stroke is fateIs this to live Ah no it is to be continually dying  This country so nearly allied to our own yet offers to our view a kind of new world divided into petty states inveterately hating each other it knows not the benefit of society except when necessity combines the various parties against a common enemy yet though necessity unites it cannot blend them the least cessation of general danger awakens all their narrow partialities and prejudices which continually break out with bloody violence The advantages of commerce the charms of literature all the graces of civilization which at once enrich the mind and form the manners are almost unknown to this people with a savage pride they fancy their very wants virtue and owe to their poverty an unregulated valor which often enables them to contend with welldisciplined troops whom they sometimes defeat by mere want of knowledge at others on the contrary they obstinately pursue an unequal contest while speculating reason turns away from the bloody scene vainly conscious that their mangled bodies strew the earth only because no benevolent  being has yet deigned to attempt the conquest of their minds  How deeply must such reflections operate on a heart bound up in the life of the accomplished leader endued but with the common powers of humanity exposed with the rest alike to the sword and to the elements he even he must one day perish and while I weep the wretches every hour deprives of their beloved protectors I know not but I may at the same moment be added to the numberAh if despair should impel Essex his natural heroism needs no such incentive should he fall unconscious of my yet surviving to that fatal though well designed artifice I should forever impute his loss and die for having seigned to do so  A wild fancy has taken strange possession of my mindLady Southampton says it is madness perhaps it really is so but I can think of nothing else she however is too timid to judgeshe will pass her whole life here I really believe  Were I but for a moment to behold that expressive countenance were I by a kind of resurrection again to appear before him  Something irresistable impels mea chosen troop are now setting outI shall be safe under their protectionAh if this ungovernable impulse should be but a presentiment of his dangernever never should I forgive myself were I to leave him wounded and dying to the care of persons comparatively indifferent  "Argue no longer my dear importunate friend I will go but depend on my hastening back"Lady Southampton would have made a wretched love for Essex she is the most apprehensive of women but she was not born to mate with that aspiring hero  THE RECESS c  PART V  A Silence so tedious will make you number me among the dead recover yourself my beloved friendborn to a perpetual contest with ill fortune I sink not even yet under the oppressionI have been collecting all my thoughts to pursue my strange recital more strange indeed every day  In our way toward Ulster we were intercepted by a body of the rebellious Irish and a desperate skirmish ensuedhow shall I own it and call myself the the love of Essex yet so it wasI who had been so valiant in imagination and remote from the field of actionI who had in fancy lifted a sword with the strength of Goliah and interposed a shield before Essex heavier perhaps than myself shrunk into annihilation at the bare sight of the conflict and the faintings which laid me among the slain perhaps alone saved me from being added to their number I revived in the hands of some ferocious women who in stripping the dead had discovered at one moment that I yet lived and was of their own sex Induced either by a sentiment of humanity or the hope of a reward they listened to my eager supplications for life and conveyed me to a neighbouring cabin whither they soon summoned a priest who opened a vein in my arm On feebly  reviving once more I cast my eyes round in speechless astonishment scarce knowing whether I should think my escape a blessing I was environed by a set of beings who in complexion alone bore any resemblance to myself their language manners and lives seeming no more analogous than those of the inhabitants of the Torrid Zone I laboured in vain to comprehend them or to make myself understood and was in despair giving up the attempt when the priest already mentioned came to my relief Through his means I informed them that the Lord Deputy would redeem me at any ransom provided they secured me from danger and insult I should I believe have ensured my own safety had not the victorious party learnt by some straggler that an English woman of distinguished rank had been discovered among the slain They eagerly turned back to demand me and the hope of reward alike influencing my preservers to keep me in their hands a dispute no less fierce though not so  bloody as that I had before witnessed followed it was too violent to be compromised and at length as the only way to prevent murder both parties agreed I should be put into the hands of their General Tiroen or as some called him O'Neal Intreaties or resistance would have been equally vain and I was obliged to rejoice they thought me of consequence enough to act so honorably by me  During this interval one of the servants deputed by Lady Southampton immediately to attend on me having lingered a few minutes behind the English troop followed to rejoin them at the moment of the onset the sound of the firing reached him ere he fell in with the scouts and clapping spurs to his horse he flew back to the village we all had lately quitted there to wait in safety the event of the contest at this place he was informed a band of rebels had issued out from an ambuscade formed in the neighbouring mountain and while he was wavering what step to take the  news of my sex and capture suddenly reached him struck with the idea of some important mystery as well from my disguise as the cautions of his Lady he hastened back to her with the strange intelligence The generous but timid Lady Southampton impressed solely with the idea of my danger wrote instantaneously to Essex briefly reciting all he did not know of my story and strongly conjuring him to exert his utmost influence to preserve me from insult  But who shall paint the feelings of Essex when the surprizing intelligence first reached him intelligence which in one moment opened all those sources of tenderness in his soul grief and despair had well nigh congealed To think I still lived would have been consummate happiness had I not been thus unaccountably snatched away even at the very moment of my miraculous renovation so singular a complication of events almost deprived him of his senses and wrought impulse up to agony Perhaps the last  untoward incident of my life was necessary to save his brain from partaking the distractions of his mindsick at the heart of an incurable sorrowfatigued with the cares of government and the slavery of command the news of my existence and capture made him find in distinctions hitherto so oppressive the sole prospect of recovering a treasure which alone could give value to his future life  From the knowledge acquired in his military command Essex was enabled to decide on the character of Tiroenhe justly believed it unprincipled and ungovernable how must he tremble then to recollect my fate was in his hands In a conjuncture so dangerous he resigned himself entirely up to the guidance of an impassioned heart and dispatched an officer of rank charging the archrebel by the blood of thousands yet unspilt not to exasperate the English and himself in particular by maltreating the lady fortune had thrown into his power for whose ransom any  sum was tendered her captors should demand  This rash and impetuous address had consequences only less dangerous than those it guarded against Tiroen unfortunately discovered at once that he had the happiness of the Lord Deputy in his keeping and though he flattered him from time to time with promises of noble treatment he secretly determined no doubt that if he ever parted with me it should be upon his own terms  It was not till several of these messages had passed that Tiroen's curiosity led him to visit me the attention excited by my masculine habit had led me immediately to request one more suited to my sex and the delicate situation I stood in obliging me to conduct myself with the utmost caution I had thought it peculiarly fortunate to escape the notice of the General  The continual repetition of his tedious visits when once he had seen me the lavish supply of such accommodations as  that ravaged country then affordedan obstinate silence on the state of my affairs and the most wearisome discussions of his own all too soon convinced me that neither his pride his ambition or his ferocity had been able to guard the heart of Tiroen from that powerful passion which invigorated the being of his distinguished rivalI trembled at the recollection that I was wholly in his poweralready misjudged as the voluntary mistress of Essex unwilling to announce myself and unable had I done so to prove my right to any name or distinction mine was indeed a fearful situation I was not allowed to hold any correspondence with the English and only knew by the watch kept over me that a human being was anxious for my release  Whatever consequences might follow my appearing pleased with the distinctions lavished on me by Tiroen I felt every day more sensibly that I had no other means of avoiding the licentious insolence of his officers who fancied their services so important  to the cause they had espoused as to secure their conduct from too strict a scrutiny  Tiroen sought occasions to break off renew and prolong the secret intercourse in which he had now engaged with Essex but a lingering treaty agreed not with the fiery impatience of that unfortunate hero His divided soul no longer could attend to the duties of his commandthe business of the war was at an endEssex was no longer a cool and prudent General watchful to seize every advantage and harrass the enemyalas he was now only a mad and extravagant lover ready to sacrifice every thing to the recovery of one adored individualDelivered up to passion to terror to agony to every torturing excess of overstrained sensibility at this fatal period the generous Essex was gradually sacrificing the whole renown of a life hitherto so glorious The news of Tiroen's love crowned his misfortunes and that execrable traitor determined to bring the Lord Deputy to his terms by various  emissaries had him informed of plots he never laid against me and repulses he never sustained speciously disowning such designs in terms calculated only to redouble the suspicions of his rival  By artifices like these the warlike talents and dignified mind of Essex were kept in absolute subjection he no longer dared to exert the valour which burned proudly at his heart but stifling every emotion love did not excite he eagerly engaged in a secret and dangerous treatyThe rash proposal of Essex to confer with Tiroen from the opposite banks of a rivulet I imputed to the passionate desire a lover ever has to judge of the person and talents of the man who dares to rival himthis interview could not be kept a secretalas perhaps it decided the fortune of the Lord DeputyMisjudged from that moment by a busy world which sees only the surface of things to timidity to avarice to indolence to ambition by turns has been ascribed an incident of which love had all the merit or the shameAh had the erroneous multitude considered  but a moment surely they had discerned a mystery in his conductWhat could ambition glory pride require he did not possess already If to hold the most absolute sway over the most absolute of Sovereigns conld gratify those wishes they were gratifiedRather ye busy Many learn to pity than condemn the generous frenzy of a bleeding heart which boldly sacrificed every thing to an overruling an irresistible passiona passion mine must break to answerand it  will  breakOh my shook brain how wild it wanders  Gay visions of a higher happier sphere where are ye ah deign to gild awhile this gloomy worldhow inexpressibly sweet are at intervals the trances of my mindcare sorrow suffering mortality itself is forgotten absorbed in a bright obscure every highwrought faculty hovers proudly on the verge of a long eternityfye on this  earthy covering how it drags down my soul my soaring soul  I wake from these day dreams and return to my subjectin fruitless and tedious negociations were thus consuming those days we would in vain recall those important days fraught with the very fate of the noblest of mankind  The long delays the eternal disappointments exhausted my patience agitated by a thousand apprehensions which no less concerned my lover than myself misery once more struck her iron fangs through my quivering heart Compelled to struggle with a soul justly conscious of purity to support an apparent tranquillity to adopt an artificial character to suffer Tiroen to delude himself into a persuasion the tye between me and Essex was dishonorable lest an uncertain one should want power to restrain him how many implicated indignities did I patiently endurePersecuted with  his base solicitations overwhelmed with bribes as splendid as they were contemptible I could ward off his expectations only by a feint my nature disdained In answer to his unbounded offers and tender protestations I one day bad him remember that in those instances he could not surpass the generous lover he sought to rival for that it was in the power of Essex to give me every thing but his  title  Tiroen paused indignantly for a moment and my heart exulting in its artifice fondly hoped the spectres of his whole line of royal ancestors would sweep before him precluding every idea of a union so dishonorable His whole estimation and the success of the war depended I well knew on his retaining the affections of the people and how could he hope for those if he disgraced the blood of the O'Neal's He scarce credited the boldness of idea which appeared in this hint of mine and struck with a persuasion I must be of some superior rank to dare thus to elevate my eyes to him he once more attempted to  dive into a mystery so carefully and obstinately concealed I was however on my guard and sunk again into my original obscurity Still eager to possess a woman he could not esteem he at last assured me after having observed that an engagement to a lady of his own family alone held his party together that he would bind himself in secret by every tye I should dictate I unwarily replied the conduct and love of Essex had been so unquestionably noble that nothing but a superior and public marriage could vindicate me even to myself in breaking with himTiroen's look and answer made me sensible of the danger of this speech and that in leaving him without hope I had left myself without safety I felt from this moment like a wretch entirely devoted and under the name of indisposition of which indeed I had sufficient reason to complain I procured from a surgeon who bled me a quantity of liquid laudanum some portion of which  I pretended to take every night but in reality reserved the whole of it for that fatal one which should confirm my fears  Such were the sufferings of Essex and myself while the two camps were in sight of each other and nothing but the most guarded vigilance could prevent the incensed English from coming to actionI was one evening alone in the tent allotted to me for Tiroen would never trust me in any neighbouring fort or town which from the ascent it was pitched on commanded the whole valley and looking with tearful eyes towards the increasing fires in the English camp when Tiroen approached me unawareshis complexion was flushed with wine and his eyes and air shewed a determination at which my nature shudderedno longer regarding decorum or respect his manners made me in a moment sensible I had deferred taking my laudanum too longAn ides at which I have never ceased to wonder suggested itself to my mind and while fiuctuating between the possible and  impossible I a little soothed the boisterous wretch at whose profligate vows I trembledintoxication deprived him of the guard he had so long kept over his lipsimagining himself already possessed of the beloved of Essex he could not forbear vaunting of the address which secured her to himI learnt with equal horror and amazement that the long delay my capture and the subsequent treaties had occasioned in the war were all concerted strokes of diabolical policy to ruin the fair fame of the Lord DeputyThat during these fatal treaties Tiroen himself had sent the most indubitable proofs to Elizabeth of the misconduct of her General and had every reason to suppose he would immediately be recalled and ignominiously punished nor could she ever select another equally dear to the army on which every thing in war dependedI turned with ineffable disdain toward the monsterOh that an eyebeam could have killed himEngrossed however by his various  views inflated with selflove and applause and confused with wine he saw not a glance which would instantaneously have unfolded my whole heart to the execrable the ungenerous traitor unworthy the race he sprung from and the sword he drewHe continued to expatiate on his hopes of wholly expelling the English and ascending the throne of Ireland but what after this unwary and black discovery could his views be to me A thousand dangers were pressing upon my soul and a thousand projects floating in my brain I had hardly temper or recollection to methodize anywhile he continued to charm himself with the disclosure of all his vanity and ambition hatred and horror nerved my heart with courage to execute a strange design the desperation of such a moment alone could have suggested Convinced by the tenor of his discourse and conduct I that could escape his licentious purposes only by feigning an intention of yielding to them I smoothed my agonized features into a smile which almost  stiffened to a convulsion and complained of thirsta glass of water stood by of which I drankinclination no less than gallantry made him insist on pledging me but refusing to give him the water without wine I mixed it with in officiousness perhaps too obvious adding the whole quantity of laudanum provided for myself The haste and tremor attending so dangerous a transaction might well have excited distrust in him at any time much more at such a crisis but not in a condition to observe very strictly and delighted with a condescension on my part alike new and unexpected in a transport of gallantry he dropt on his knees and uniting my name with his own cemented both with that of happiness the latter seemed to tremble back into my heart as he eagerly swallowed the beverage Sleep had before hovered over his eyelids it was now forerun by stupefaction The hour of rest arrived but the women who usually slept in the outer tent came not near itI could not doubt but that their absence was owing to the previous orders  given by the General and falling on my knees intreated him who armed the Assyrian with courage voluntarily to dare the situation into which I was brought unconsenting to bear me boldly and safely through it A fortitude equal to the danger seemed to spring from the address and the occasionThe regimental cloak Tiroen had thrown off on entering served to cover my masculine habit which I resumed with expedition it was a cloak so remarkable and familiar to every eye in the camp as almost to ensure my safety I overweighed my throbbing temples with his warlike plume and finally drawing from his finger a signet to produce if necessary I boldly grasped his dagger to decide my fate should I be discovered and issued forth a second Judith  I had warily marked the progress of the night the last watch had now gone by and the time was past when it was probable any officer should be stirring of note enough to address the General I had heard Tiroen say it was his common practice to walk the camp at night and  in that confidence ventured to pass for him Scarce had I gone a hundred paces when the homage of the centinels assured me the counterfeit was undiscovered  With an agitated heart I passed from one to another guided only by the distant lights for Tiroen always pitched his camp on a hill till near the advanced guard I then retired behind a large tent and disrobing myself of their General's accoutrements put on a common hat I had carried for that purposewhat were my terrors when having reached the confines of the camp now doubly watched I presented the signet as a proof I was sent on earnest businessThe guard hesitated but after tediously debating while I went through tortures they judged it prudent to admit a token which alone could have enabled me to reach them and I was suffered to pass  I shot like an arrow from a bow when once these dreaded limits were overleaped scarce daring to address my very soul to  heaven lest one lost moment should undo me  Whether my eyes had deceived me in the imagined nearness of the English camp or my trembling and unguided feet had wandered wide of it I know not but sorely were they blistered ere I approached its limitspiercing through thickets which tore alike my garments and my flesh with spirits fainting even to death I suddenly heard a scout give the watchword in English Overjoyed to think myself safe I unhappily wanted presence of mind to pronounce a single syllable and the officious soldier mistaking me for a spy levelled his piece and instantly pierced my sideMy spirits were no longer equal to contending with danger or with death and the fear of discovery being the prevailing sentiment of my sex I feebly conjured the man if he hoped for pardon to bear me to the tent of the Lord Deputy The delicacy of my complexion and cloaths had already surprized the inadvertent soldierhe quickly called together some  of his companions who assisted in laying me on a hurdle and bearing me toward the tent of Essex The morning was now brokeI saw the early beams of the sun emblazon the golden ornaments of the General's tentsome officers came out of it as I approachedMy heart from which life seemed every moment ready to issue made a courageous effort to collect into itself the scattered principles of a being I appeared on the very point of resigning I fancied ere he yet spoke I heard the voice so dear to meI fancied ah I indeed  saw  him rush forward on the first hint but rootbound as it were he stopped before he came to me and sent his very soul forth in a groan"Yes Essex cried I extending my feeble hand the wretch heaven did not allow to live in thy arms receives its next indulgence in being permitted to die there"But how shall I describe the tearful transports the touching agonies of his recovered intellects I sunk under the keen estcasy of the moment  and long faintings succeeded occasioned by my loss of blood which once more brought me to the very verge of the grave  The amiable Lady Southampton came at the instance of her cousin and gave by her presence a decorum to my situation it had long wanted Every effort of art was exerted to soothe my broken spirits and strengthen my exhausted frame He who alone could give efficacy to medicine hovered ever near and when speech was interdicted by affectionate looks sustained meAh how pleasant were even these sufferings how sweet was it to collect back into my heart those gentle impulses war and terror had driven from their homeTo affiance my soul in silence to its only Lord and to fancy whatever fate heaven should hereafter ordain him mine could no longer be divided from it  As soon as my amended health allowed I entered into a detail of all that had passed since Lord Essex left me at St  Vincent's Abbey He in return informed me that the lethargy into which Tiroen was plunged by the laudanum I had so hastily administered was very near being fatal to him as the utmost effort of care and medicine could only preserve him the faculty of breathing since to disturb his deep and unwholesome slumbers always threw him into a dangerous delirium The courageous effort by which I had recovered my liberty he added had formed the whole conversation of both camps while my fate was yet uncertain I blessed the awful power who saved me the guilt of murdering even a villain and did not immediately remark that Essex gave me no farther information  I soon learnt from Lady Southampton the painful truths my Lord sought to hide from methat Elizabeth had incessantly urged him to prosecute a war which his fears for me had hitherto suspended but finding at length that both in treaties and commands were lost upon him she grew cold and  disgusted His friends in England had given him but too much reason to believe that his enemies were gradually acquiring the ascendancy in her heart he as gradually lost since all her favours were now lavished on Sir Walter Raleigh the house of Cecil and the Earl of Nottingham a party who had long meditated the downfall of Essex and Southampton of which they now spoke as a certainty and that even the common people beheld with discontent the slow progress of the war in Ireland nor could Essex any longer depend upon popularity  The unguarded friend who made me this recital engrossed by her own share in it forgot how it interested me I called to mind the information sent by Tiroen to Elizabeth which but too well accounted for the Queen's anger and disgust and conceived at once all its probable consequences Essex unlike all other favorites could never be brought to know any claim to superiority but meritincapable of those little arts  by which meaner minds attach the insidious train of sycophants a Court always abounds with he had ever scorned a partial monopoly and politic distribution of posts and placesThe mercenary wretches who had bowed to him in vain paid their court to his enemies with more success and instructed by them in every weakness of the favorite were ever ready to strengthen any prejudice the Queen might conceive against him A thousand fears incident to age and decaying power were thus cherished in her which magnified by passions time itself could never allay might perhaps stamp the base intelligence of Tiroen with the fatal authority of unbiassed truth and give to the inactivity of Essex the appearance of treasonSuch a train of circumstances could hardly sail to stagger a mind in full possession of the noblest and most impartial judgment what then might we not fear from a Sovereign always influenced by prejudices each passing day strengthened as it insensibly impaired her reason Fortunately by an extrava  gance of dotage which almost punished the errors of her youth those prejudices had hitherto united in his favouryet while I perceived but a single chance against him my soul shrunk from the idea of entrusting his life with her  To give Lord Essex the opportunity of vindicating himself to Elizabeth I resolved to account for her conduct and divulged to him the inadvertent acknowledgment made by Tiroen during our last memorable interview of his own perfidy and dissimulation A generous scarlet burnt on the cheek of Essex while he execrated the traitor but struck immediately with a full conviction of the consequences that might result from this base intelligence he formed the extraordinary resolution of returning to England to justify his honor  This determination no less shocked than surprized me far from imagining my information would lead to so wild a project I rather supposed it would suggest to him the impossibility of ever revisiting England unless the reduction of Ulster was fully accomplishedIn truth I dared  not confess my fears that even then to remain with the army alone could ensure his safetyEvery reason I durst urge or Southampton enforce were in his judgment feebler than his ownhis honor was piqued and nothing could hinder him from vindicating itPersuaded a step as bold as this alone would convince Elizabeth of his innocence and accustomed to regain whenever he appeared that influence over her his enemies had often encroached on in his absence he persuaded himself he need only be seen to triumph and concluded a truce as the preliminary to his departure  The pride of sex sensibility and honor contended with the leading passion of my nature and taught me to disdain overruling him I could not convincenevertheless I almost sunk under the conflictThe frightful situation in which I had been placed since my arrival in Ireland made me obstinately refuse to continue there whenever Essex should leave it and the curiosity I had excited alike by my bold escape and wound made  it hazardous to commit me to the charge of any officer left behind Surrounded with friends relations and dependents Essex such is the painful uncertainty ever attending on elevated rank knew not one to whom he could safely intrust so delicate a care The generous Southampton determined to share the fate of his friend by accompanying him proposed to unite that of his Lady with mine by shipping us off ere they embarked with servants they should mutually select apparently bound for France but in fact for the coast of Cumberland In the most romantic and solitary part of that remote county the Wriothesleys had long owned a castle where malice itself would hardly seek and certainly never find us there he assured Essex we might repose in peace till they should return again to Ireland I felt all the merit of this project by which the amiable Southampton robbed himself of the dear society of his wife merely to do honor to the beloved of his friend and adopted it with the utmost  eagerness from the hope that if the busy transmitters of Lord Essex's actions had ever mentioned me this total separation would extinguish all jealousy in the mind of Elizabeth who I knew would much sooner overlook the loss of an army than his heart  Although Essex knew not how to place me happily in Ireland it was with pain he consented to my quitting it but finding me obstinately partial to Lord Southampton's design he consented to my resuming my masculine disguise and selected a vessel whose captain was devoted to him having ordered a lighter one to be prepared for himself  So sad a presentiment shivered my soul on the morn appointed for our embarkation that it was the utmost effort of my principles to suffer Essex to act in conformity to his I had previously insisted he should sail at the same moment with myself to end my fears of that formidable savage Tiroen and when he entered my chamber to conduct me to the ship my heart  quivered on lips which had no longer the power to utter a syllableHe besought he conjured me to support my sinking spirits "the highest hopes he added with an air of sincerity elevated his own that it had always been his pride his pleasure to deserve the distinctions lavished on him by the Queen and whatever views he had formed when heaven should call her hence he could not resolve even by ingratitude much less treason to shorten her days who had crowned his with glory Doubt not concluded he my love but I shall recover all my influence and remember when next we meet it is to part no more"  Illomened seemed that sentence to meI fancied too his voice founded hollowI fanciedalas every dire chimera sensibility presents to an impassioned heart took full possession of mine yet as to exert the least influence at so trying a moment was to render myself accountable for his future fate I opposed every ennobling sentiment to an ungovernable  passion and heroically resigned him up to his duty  We quitted the port at the same instant he steering for that nearest the Irish coast I for the North of EnglandBoth by consent remained on the deck with fouls fixed on each other till the beloved individual vanished and the vessel seemed an object only less dear that at length diminished to a cloud the cloud shrunk to a speck and the speck became invisibleI threw myself on my bed and giving way to the tears I had hitherto stifled I besought the Almighty to guard him he had so eminently distinguished  Compassion had induced Essex to consent to our conveying over an old officer who had been desperately wounded The intense sickness produced by the element caused his wounds to open which obliged us to put back and land him or sacrifice his life to our convenience and this unforeseen delay exposed us to a calamity as lasting as it was grievous  Launched a second time on those rest less surges to which alone I could compare my own perturbed soul the next day brought the comparison still nearer A dreadful tempest arose nor were we within reach of any port The enraged and howling winds drove the vessel at pleasure a thousand times sidelong into the deep and the impetuous and foaming waves threw it up again with equal violenceWe remained stupified with terror shut down with our women in the cabin the rapid motions and cries of the seamen the tremendous cracks and groans of the vessel united with the warring elements to make that fate indifferent every moment brought nearer To prepare my mind for the impending event I however recollected with due gratitude to heaven that the light vessel in which Essex failed had doubtless made a near port ere the storm began and landed him in safety  I pondered once more on that wonderful character I had so often considered I saw however strong the predominant  foible of Lord Essex it still gave way to rectitude and fearful the passion which led him towards me might one day affect his safety I bent to the awful God who thus in thunder called away its weak and helpless objectnot without admiring the singularity of that destiny which by interring me in the ocean secured the forged death and funeral I had published for myself from ever being discovered  Strengthened if not consoled by these ideas I sought to chear my no less suffering friend who rejecting alike food and comfort resigned herself wholly up to sickness faintings and sorrowAh who shall say we suffer in vain the feelings of the soul like the organs of sight gain strength by use till we dare to analyze that fate we once could not have ventured to consider while the refined and exquisite sense of mental anguish which renders us superior to common evils often gives an apparent sublimity to efforts which are little in our own estimationLady Southampton yet distinguished by nature fortune love clung to those rich possessions  and shrunk from the awful immortality which threatened every moment to take place of themShe listened to me with wonder and this instance of fortitude impressed her mind with a reverence for my character time could never obliterate  The sudden abatement of the storm contributed little to our safety as the ship ill calculated for such a conflict had bulged upon a rock and now filled so fast with water that the utmost diligence of the crew could hardly save us from sinkingThe sight of land ere the evening closed had scarce power to chear for a moment wretches who no more hoped to behold the dawning of the mornTo the uproar and turbulence of the storm a silent horror and desolation had now succeeded scarce less shocking Midnight was hardly turned ere a dismal universal cry informed us the vessel was sinkingLady Southampton threw her arms helplessly round me and the unprincipled part of the crew bursting  into our cabin increased the horrors of the moment by opening our coffers and gathering together their most valuable contents an officer followed who taking our hands in silence led us toward the decktwo boats were now preparingthe last melancholy hope we had of survivingThe captain who happily owed every thing to Essex informed us that as the larger boat had the better chance he had fixed on placing us in that ere the scattered crew could collect and by pressing too numerously upon us rob us of a last hopeWe were conveyed into the boat while he was yet speaking and the sailors so impetuously followed regardless of the captain's remonstrances and commands that our danger seemed hardly diminished by the removalA hope nevertheless arose which encouraged each individual to an exertion from whence the general safety was ascertained Entirely enveloped in the only watchcoat which had been taken from the wreck Lady Southampton  and myself who were the only women saved knew but by the voices of our companions whether life or death was to be expectedthe sea ran high and the grey dawn presented to our eager eyes a coast which we were informed was that of Scotland at no great distance an old castle appeared on a sharp projection of the land whose solid battlements seemed proof against every attack of art and nature but the shoals rocks and surf which intervened threatened to make us ever behold it at a hopeless distance unless we could interest the compassion of its owners  Every signal of distress was made for hours apparently in vain till the turn of the tide when two fishing boats appeared slowly working their way towards us A discordant shout of joy on the part of our companions split the ears of my sick friend and self who inly worshipped the power that preserved usThe benevolent strangers approached and their garb no less than unknown language  proclaimed them natives of the Scotch coast To the men around us they offered biscuits and whisky in abundance and bestowed on me and Lady Southampton a draught of cold water which seemed as much more refreshing as it was innocent  Revived by this unexpected revolution in our fate we by joint consent shook off the heavy watchcoat which had a little saved us from the incessant spray of the enraged sea and when the boat was at length drawn towards the slight of rude steps leading to the castle we both quitted it with no less celerity than thankfulnessOur progress was for a moment impeded by surprizeat the gate of the castle stood two beings who seemed of some superior order so singular were their dress beauty and benevolenceA youth and his sister waved us toward them with graceful courtesythe latter wore a light vest and coat of Scots plaid with a belt of green sattin clasped with gold the rude wind had carried off the covering  of her hair and caused her long auburn locks to stream on the bosom of the morning exposing to view her slight ancles half booted and tinging her cheeks with that pure cold colour youth health innocence and heaven alone can giveThe youth who in features strongly resembled his sister was habited as a hunter with a spear in his hand and a dagger hanging in his beltBoth with smiles of hospitality ran forward to receive us and while the young lady took the arm of my friend the youth with an impassioned pleasure shook my hand casting a look of mingled wonder and disdain at the soiled though rich habiliments I had on which indeed originally rather agreed with my own sex than that I intruded upon The antique hall into which they conducted us was hung with tattered banners mouldy coats of arms and every proud remnant of war and ancientry Refreshments suitable to our past distress were busily set before us nor with that intuitive politeness superior minds always  possess did either venture to express a curiosity till they had frankly satisfied oursFrom them we learnt that the spot fortune had thrown us on was an island on the coast of Scotland and the place which sheltered us Dornock Castle held by the Laird of that name that they were brother and sister to that Laird who was now absent on a family concern of no small moment in short that their elder sister Mabel famed through the country for her beauty having unhappily shewn it at Court the King would not suffer her to return and their brother fearful she should yield to his licentious wishes had hastened thither to claim her The young people who made this artless recital were formed to grace itwhen the fair Phoebe spoke of the charms of her sister her own were heighthened by a softer fuller bloom and when she mentioned their dangerous effect the proud blush of a generous shame gave manliness to the boyish features of her brother HughAccustomed as my friend and self had long been to every worldly charm and  advantage we saw in this remote spot and these untutored children of nature a simple and noble grace art only refines away  When it came to my turn to narrate I used every artifice to guard against the possibility of dangerAdopting the name Lady Southampton had lately quitted I called myself Vernon a youth employed till lately as a page in the train of the Earl of Essex and now his secretarythe lady with me I said allied to the Earl of Southampton was lately wedded to me and both were following these noblemen when overtaken by the tempest which had thrown us upon their shore and rendered us debtors to their humanity Finding we came from the seat of war and were conversant with the Court of England they both asked a thousand various questions suitable to their sex age and simplicity respecting the one and the other and our descriptions to their unformed conceptions comprized every charm of magnificence glory and gaiety  The happy device of a pretended marriage enabling me to share the chamber of Lady Southampton we chose the hour of retirement to consider our present situation and the mode most likely to restore us once more to the country and connections from which the storm had separated usMy friend justly remarked that the sailors wrecked with us and its natives were all the people likely to visit this remote and solitary isle and that if we failed to take advantage of the departure of the first we should throw ourselves wholly upon the generosity of the Laird of Dornock of whose character we could not venture to decide from those of the amiable young people who had so warmly embraced our causeAfter the application of Essex to my brother in my favour had been rejected I had every thing to fear if any circumstance should betray me into his power and the strictest secresy on our names and condition alone could give us a hope of libertyhow under such restrictions we could clearly  explain our present situation to the two noblemen whom alone it concerned neither of us could discover nevertheless necessity obliged us to come to some resolution and persuaded the writing of each would be known to him to whom the letter was addressed weary as we both were a part of the night was spent in preparing two epistles for the sailors to conveyThe morning came and with it the mortifying information that we were a few hours too late the men saved with us having hired a fishing smack in which they sailed away at the turn of the tide nor did the owners know their destination till the vessel returned I was not without an idea that our youthful protectors had voluntarily concealed so material an event in the hope of detaining us but certainly had that really been the case it was not half so inexcusable as our own imprudence and neglectWe hired a boat to pursue them with the letters but after several days spent in painful expectation the packets were returned to us  with the mortifying information that all enquiry had proved fruitless We had now no resource but in the generosity of the Laird of Dornock and endeavoured to fortify ourselves with patience to wait his return  The youthful brother and sister expressed a generous concern for out situation but wholly without power they could do no morePrisoners at large as we were effectually bounded by the roaring ocean and depending solely on contingencies for freedom the days to us crept heavily awayI sometimes remembred with a sigh that I was in Scotlandthat kingdom where by inheritance I might claim a rank that would enable me to decide my own fate had not a combination of events forerunning even my birth made every advantage of fortune and nature alike useless to me I endeavoured to discover the real character of their King but even from the report of his friends to be able to term it good I was obliged to think it weak and in  that case knew he would inevitably be surrounded with artful politicians ready to profit by his foible in short I found however near he and I were allied in blood we were born to be distinct beings in creation and to meet would endanger the safety of the weaker When I turned my anxious soul toward England it brought me no reliefAs far from the reach of intelligence as if in the wilds of Arabia I in vain sought to discover the reception Essex had met with at CourtThat name which in the vanity of my heart I had often thought the world resounded with I found with checked pride was scarcely known in an adjacent country till my lips so often repeated it and even when most anxious to oblige me those of others only echoed the found so dear so beloved I had but too much reason to fear doubts of my safety would make him careless of his own and often would have resigned every brilliant prospect fancy ever spread before me to ascertain the life of the Earl  Too late I regretted the pride of heart which had made me resist the desire I felt to detain him in Ireland and could not but acknowledge it was rather that than principle which reconciled me to his departure yet in a situation so delicate as ours to wish was to command and the sacrifice his own soul did not dictate mine disdained to receive  My mind now daily passed through such a chaos of ideas and emotions as would have prevented the time from appearing tedious had not its prolongation been the origin of most of them  Often sitting on the rude battlements of the castle while the surges beat against their base have I tuned the lute of Phoebe and while she warbled a few wild airs of inconceivable melody in a language unknown to me my full soul has wept over the mysterious fate of my sisterAh how easy is it to be unknownto be entombed aliveIf I even in a civilized adjacent kingdom in effect the country of all my ancestors can be thus  helpless what may the poor Matilda have beenTurn busy imagination from the fatal supposition  The oversight we had committed in suffering the sailors to leave us became every day more and more regrettedLady Southampton soon found herself in a situation that required the tenderest indulgence and would forbid removal even if our asylum should be traced by anxious love We spent our lives in fretting and had we not possessed an unlimited intimacy I know not how we should have endured the incessant chagrindeprived even of the usual resources a scanty library a lute some rustic airs and a pedigree as old as the creation bounded the possessions and knowledge of our young friends and could not add any thing to our own  The Laird of Dornock however returned at lastAh how unlike his gentle kindredphlegmatic selfwilled crested and imperious his aspect presented a correspondent harshness and we instantly felt it vain to rest a hope on his  friendship he no doubt reproved his brother and sister for having lived on such familiar terms with strangers avowedly subordinate and though he often made us sensible our company was a burthen he took not a single step to relieve himself from it Phoebe had begun to improve herself in musick ere his arrival it was his pleasure she should continue to do so but his presence threw a coldness and constraint over the whole party which made what I had once thought a relief an inconceivable toil The ingenuous noble girl saw her brother's insolence with a grief which prevented her from profiting by the lessons so much desiredher gushing tears would often relax the strings of her lute while lowwarbling tales of hopeless love and her sad eyes fix themselves on mine with an expression too strong to be misunderstood I perceived while unconscious of the danger because possessed with the remembrance of my own disguise I had won the gentle heart I only sought to formCircumstanced as I was this could not but  be a dangerous acquisition and by a fatality yet more alarming her elder brother soon after became enamoured of Lady Southampton nor did he conceal that inclinationhe had from his arrival regarded me with an eye which indicated doubt on the subject of our marriage but the increasing size of my friend and our habit of living together appeared to controvert a suspicion which nevertheless remained in his mind  Anxious to profit by the only hour in the day which could favor his views he was obliged to give the advantage he sought and permit me to teach his sister with no other guard than his younger brother Hugh while he passed the interval with Lady SouthamptonAll equally rejoiced at an incident all had equally desired as to myself determined from the moment I had been convinced of the passion of the fair Phoebe to seize the first opportunity of intrusting her with my disguise ere shame for the mistake should disgust her with the object I was not sorry to confide it to  her brother as if it did not more attach him to my interest it would at least obviate every fear he might entertain on his sister's account whom he could then safely leave at any time This just candor produced more consequences than one The sweet Phoebe started blushed and first lifting her swimming eyes toward heaven then covered them with her handswhen I ceased to speak she timorously raised them to my face"Ah why had you not been thus sincere at first cried the generous girl the power was then in our hands  now  "she shook her head and in that emphatic gesture strongly finished her imperfect speech Alarmed and anxious I conjured her to confide to me those reasons which made our situations in her opinion so hopeless She could not resist my entreaties and at length acknowledged that from the moment her elder brother returned Hugh no less than myself had observed a haughtiness and severity in his air and language more forbidding than usual at  last they had discovered that their sister Mabel far from listening to virtue and the Laird of Dornock had yielded to the King and to protect herself from her family had been compelled to publish her shame by claiming her lover's protection To reconcile the Laird of Dornock to so cutting a disgrace a title had been offered him with any post about the Court he should fix on and that at length thé fair Mabel consoled herself for the forfeiture of every rational distinction by the temporary honor of reigning in the heart of her King and being called a Countess" I enquired with surprize how an event should affect us in which we apparently had no concern Hugh answered "his brother far from accepting the splendid coverings offered for infamy had retired from Court in great indignation that at first they had both been compelled to scorn and return every letter and present sent by their sister yet of late some view inexplicable to them had made a singular alteration in the Laird of Dornock's sentiments  Several couriers had been dispatched by him to the favourite Countess but neither their commissions nor the answers ever transpired yet many circumstances had given them reason to believe that our pacquets had never been forwarded as we were taught to believeI changed colour at the idea of this deliberate treachery thanking heaven I alone had been informed of it as Lady Southampton often unable to govern her feelings by some imprudent speech would infallibly have betrayed her knowledge of it The young Hugh observing my uneasiness assured me though hopeless of finding a faithful messenger he held himself answerable for the release of those he had contributed to enthrall and that I might depend upon his own serviees if I would deign to confide in him nor should we be suspected as the causes of his disappearance since the Laird of Dornock well knew his sister Mabel's particular fondness for him and would naturally imagine he was determined to profit by  the high favour she held at Court" Is there a charm on earth so touching as generosity The noble youth paused with an air that indicated his ardent desire of having his offer accepted lest it should be mistaken for a vaunt I took a hand of each young friend and returning acknowledgments suitable to the occasion declined embroiling them with their fullen brother who could not want power to render our situation much more intolerable if once he suspected us of alienating his family from their dutyI persuaded them as well as myself that our own friends would with unwearied diligence search us out the moment they discovered any part of the crew survived the wreck of which the Captain would certainly inform them unless he sunk with the ship  Yet day after day proved this hope vain and fallaciousA dreary winter passed away in this remote Castle through every aperture of which the keen and howling wind poured unrestrained and the wild  ocean swelled with frequent storms while our affrighted senses often mistook the roar of the tempest for the groans of the dying  I had almost ceased to hope when one day while our host was hunting I wandered to the battlements as usual and descried from thence a small vessel approaching better built and more clean than those I was accustomed to see as it drew nearer the land I perceived English dressesMy heart took the alarm I leant impatiently forward straining the keen sense whose imperfection I complained ofThe boat drew nearI discerned the regimental of Essex I gave a groan of exquisite delight and reeling forward should have plunged into the ocean had not the young Hugh who stood behind held me fastThe officer looked up and I instantly perceived him to be Henry Tracey the favorite aiddecamp of Lord Essex once before deputed in search of meDisappointment mingled with the various and interesting  emotions of the momentI pointed to the stranger sighed and fainted away  They bore me to Lady Southampton who thunderstruck at seeing me lifeless and unable to guess the cause seemed little better herself Hugh who clearly comprehended from my impassioned gesture how interesting the arrival of the stranger was to me hastened to bring him him to our apartment while yet his brother was absent when instantly retiring he left us full liberty "Tracey" cried both of us at once "Essex" "Southampton" echoed each heart "sum up all in a word""They live returned he and need only behold you to be happy"Ah gracious heaven cried I lifting my eyes thither while I presented my heart with my hand to the faithful messenger receive my transport we now can breathe freely give us the relief of knowing the events which followed the dangerous voyage of Essex and Southampton" "I should hardly dare to do so had I not first assured you of their safety resumed Tracey for  sorrow I see has been preying already on your bloom it would not perhaps have been more spared had you passed this trying interval in London"  Apprehensive every moment of an interruption from the Laird of Dornock I besought the worthy Tracey to dispense with all preface and hasten his recital  "With terror and anxiety continued he I followed my Lord into the vessel selected to convey him home nor were these emotions diminished when I perceived the Lord Deputy full of fits of doubt and reflection which at times were obvions even to himself often would he affect to drown them in gay society and wine and for the first time in his life he assumed a false braveryAt the hours of retirement far from indulging that intimacy so long established between him and Lord Southampton of which I had often been a grateful and humble partaker he sunk into an absence of mind and total silence no less alarming to his beloved friend than myself in effect that Nobleman saw he had  'set his fortune  on a cast and he would stand the hazard of the die'  as I conjectured by his turning to me one day and by an expressive motion of his head leading mine towards the side of the vessel where my Lord leant his thoughtful countenance apparently fixed on those rolling waves which yet perhaps he saw not "All is not well in the heart of thy Lord Tracey" said his noble friend then pausing a moment he added in a lower tone "Ah Essex  aut Caesar aut nullus  " the Lord Deputy happily advanced and saved me the necessity of corroborating sentiments it gave me pain to adopt  It was not with the customary greetings we beheld the pleasant shores of our native countrydoubt and anxiety threw a gloom over those lively and spontaneous emotions which often suspend even the sense of suffering Lord Essex lost not a moment but posted toward the Court with such expedition that he outwent all information and was his own harbingerWe arrived one morning ere  yet the Queen left her chamber but alas it was no longer the Court we had leftevery face around appeared strange to us and we saw too plainly that the invidious Cecils reigned there triumphantLord Grey a favorite of theirs whom we had met on the road had presumed to pass the Earl of Essex without noticethat Nobleman gave him only an eyebeam and hastened on to decide his fateForm was annihilated by circumstances and he rushed into the presence of Elizabeth the moment his arrival was announcedaccustomed to behold him with complacency to receive him with kindness she yielded through surprize to the habits of so many years and granted the private audience he requestedShe listened to a vague and weak vindication of his conduct in Ireland and the dotage of her soul was transiently gratified with the idea that he had preferred the recovery of her affection to that of his reputation in arms After a long conference the Earl rejoined his friends pride and pleasure  had flushed his cheek and the idea of reassuming his accustomed influence diffused through his mien that benignity and graciousness which are at once its nature and its charm Resentment and rage never constituted any part of his characters but at the moment he suffered by those passions such galling sensations were already forgottenOverwhelmed with the congratulations of his friends encircled even by his overawed enemies the heroic Essex rose above the triumph he could not but desireevery face was instantaneously changed and those who knew not an hour before whether they should recollect him now with servile adulation hallowed his very footstepsThis fatal interval of shortlived power was however the last heaven allowed himThe crasty Cecils and their faction seized the moment he injudiciously quitted the Queen to persuade her this indulged favourite had not only acted contrary to his commission in venturing himself to return but that he had brought home with him all his chosen  adherents as well as every aspiring spirt likely to strengthen his sway and circumscribe hersThey touched the soul of Elizabeth where it was most vulnerable and having thus opposed to each other the two leading weaknesses of her nature by throwing the weight of party into the one scale it soon preponderated She was unhappily in that declining age which renders every human being in some degree capricious and timid Already tinctured with fear she soon yielded to the various informations officiously brought her by factious consederatesShe was told on all hands that Lord Essex was holding a Court even in her Palace and insolent and daring as this conduct could not but appear it was of less consequence than the unbounded influence he ever maintained over the peoplean influence he would more than recover the moment he was seen in London "For  themselves  they heeded notwilling martyrs to their integrity and fealty but for their Queen they all trembled at the prospect"It was  too hazardous to be risqued by Elizabeth fear and resentment conquered the tender prepossession which still struggled faintly at her heart and she determined to ascertain her own safety as well as that of her kingdom by imprisoning her favorite nor is this resolution to be wondered at since even her love conduced to it when irritated by the imaginary sting of ingratitude She had set the Earl up in early youth as an idol for her own heart to worship but he was not born to be satisfied with unmerited admirationthe more he acquired the more he sought to deserve till having established his favour on innate nobleness he rose above partial distinction leaving her to lament at leisure the very elevation she had given From this period she had been weak and irresolute in every instance where he was concerned at intervals lavishing honors to which he had no title at others withholding advantages he had fairly won The motive of this inconsistency he could not fail to discern but persuaded an attachment  which thus powerfully coped with her judgment was unconquerable he forgot that she was sinking fast into the vale of years when the noblest passions insensibly condense into selflove  You who so well know the heart of my Lord Madam cried Tracey turning to me will better imagine than I can describe his deep sense of an indignity entirely public and apparently premeditated So unexpected a manoeuvre mastered his judgment and giving way to the most passionate extremes he drew his sword and would have returned it by her messenger beseeching her "to reward his services by adding a more decisive blow to that she once before bestowed on him since both seemed to him less shocking and ignominious than such open and unmerited contumely"In vain his friend sought to moderate his wrath in vain his enemies drew near eager to catch and treasure the rash expressions he should unwarily utter and convert them to his ruinTouched on  the tenderest point his honor the world combined would have wanted power to silence himhe gave full scope to his indignant and wounded feelings and with a severity of truth more galling and dangerous than the greatest exaggerations declared aloud "the Queen had outlived all her nobler faculties and that her soul was grown as crooked as her body" This cutting sarcasm was too faithfully conveyed to Elizabeth who regardless of his pride while her own was thus wounded committed him to the charge of the Lord Keeper whose house was in effect his prison  Oh heavens what wild vicissitudes what transports of passion took possession of my Lord at recollecting the imprudent readiness with which he had delivered himself helpless and unguarded into the hands of his enemies struggling like a lion in the toils every vein would sometimes swell almost to madness nor dared I leave him a moment alone  I had no other hope of assuaging his irritated passions than by recalling to his  mind the beloved image of the fair voyager to whom the news of this event and the fear of what might follow it would be little less than death I averted one storm however only to give free passage to another the tear of tenderness proudly trembled on the burning cheek of anger and a grief it split my heart to behold took possession of his"Spare me the killing remembrance he would crydisgraceddefamedimprisoned how shall I ever lift my eyes to that fair that noble sufferer I tell thee Tracey rather would I have died than known this shameful moment"Impressed by the unwearied attachment I had ever shewn him and overweighed by the sense of his own situation my Lord at length condescended to lighten his own heart by unfolding to me its dearest views well he knew they would never pass beyond mineno every vein of it should crack ere I would wrong so generous a confidence which I acknowledge but to prove my fate wholly dependent on the Nobleman  I serve I would have it so and heaven could afflict me only by separating them  The faithful Lord Southampton was his daily visitant though not himself a prisoner the consciousness that every action of his life was watched and reported bound that Nobleman to a most cautious observance The Cecils had now no wish ungratified for the imprudent bitterness of Lord Effex had supplied the only fuel to the Queen's resentment which could long keep it alive nor did time in cooling the passions of my Lord incline him to submissionconvinced in his own mind he was the injured person reflection only settled rage into disgust and contempt nevertheless his constitution sufferred severely by this variety of passions when one seized upon it which annihilated all the rest and completely debilitated his healtha grief more touching than glory or ambition could occasion suddenly overcame himThe time was now elapsed which ought to have brought to him and Lord Southampton the welcome  assurance that the partners of their souls were safe in Cumberlandthe time was come I sayalas it was goneAfraid to communicate to each other a terror which preyed alike on both Lord Southampton dispatched express upon express in vainThe days that lingered so tediously away however matured doubt into certainty Lord Essex no longer contended with the nervous sever which obliged him to take to his bed where reaching out a languid hand to his overpowered friend he broke at last the fearful heavy silence "They are gone forever gone my dear Southampton cried he in the low accent of incurable despair heaven has spared to souls so gentle and susceptible those trials our stouter minds can perhaps better contend withOh thou dear one yet do I regret that this bosom did not receive thy last sighs that entombed with thee even in the ocean death had not consummated a union fortune ever frowned onbut I hasten impatiently to rejoin thee oh Ellinor my first my only love"  The killing remembrance which distracted his mind soon rendered a malady slight at first desperate he was even given over the Queen for a long time withstood the accounts given by his friends of his situation so deeply had his enemies impressed her with the idea that this was only a refined artifice to tempt her to humiliate herself Nevertheless by one of those passionate emotions with which nature sometimes overreaches the most elaborate finesses of art she suddenly determined to ascertain his real situation by sending her own physician to visit himThe report of that gentleman convinced her of its dangerhe was ordered to watch over the Earl with the most anxious care and even to hint to him that every distinction would be restored with his healthBut alas sympathy itself had no longer any charms for him and the presence of Lord Southampton seemed the only relief his fate admitted That amiable Nobleman no less sensible of the mutual calamity than  his friend had not the same reasons to bury his affliction it in silenceRepeated messengers were sent alike to Cumberland and the port you embarked from ladies those who returned from the latter only confirmed the fears which had hitherto fluctuatedthey informed the lover and the husband that the wife of the Captain mourned for him as dead nor was it doubted but that the crew and passengers were alike victims to a storm so sudden and tremendous The active and enlivened soul frequently exhausts its most acute sensations by anticipationCertainty could not add to the grief occasioned by surmise and the extinguished hopes of the friends gave them alike up to that cold and sullen despair which is the worst of all states because frequently incurable Those late hopes the Queen was willing to revive her dying favorite with made not the least impression on him and the Cecils learnt with astonishment that neither their views their conduct nor even his own disgrace  ful imprisonment anylonger touched Lord Essex nay that not even his recovery was able to revive those habits the world were taught to think hitherto uncontroulable His friends on the contrary blest the skilful physician who prolonged a life so valuable and saw with the happiest hopes that those romantic flights in his character his enemies had almost wrought up to his ruin were at once extinguished leaving it without any other distinction than a melancholy sweetness which rather turned his thoughts toward philosophy than war The people ever naturally disposed to side with the unfortunate cried out that he was the innocent victim of the Cecil party who by some odious strokes of policy added popularity to their depressed rival in diminishing their ownElizabeth herself could no longer support the idea that the man she still loved was obscurely breaking his heart while yet in the flower of youth in an unmerited and disgraceful prisonShe yielded to the information of  the physician that his amending health required air and sent him her permission to retire to any of his seats in the country but forbad him to attempt appearing in her presence a restriction perhaps more agreeable to him than herself could she have seen the desolate situation of mind in which he departed  From the country he addressed a letter of thanks to the Queen which displayed at once his eloquence gratitude and languor in truth the latter gained ground daily in his character Lord Essex was born capable of uniting in his preson every various and generous pursuit had fortune allowed it but not even he was equal to living without oneI frequently trembled at beholding his gloom and inanity Wholly removed from the sphere in which he had hither moved and the pleasures he had once enjoyed the rude society of his neighbours and the boisterous amusements the country afforded rather offended than filled an enlightened and susceptible heart He wandered  all day in the woods alone and returned every evening spent and unrefreshed only to recover animal strength enough to enable him to pass the morrow in the same melancholy manner  In this situation I fancied a false hope could not add to his danger and might perhaps rouse those active faculties every hour seemed more and more to absorb I one day ventured to repeat to him an imaginary dream tending to prove you still existedNot even the firmest mind can resist the subtle attacks of superstition when labouring under depressionHis soul so eagerly adopted the fiction of my brain that I was a thousand times tempted to acknowledge it to be such but dared not venture to shew him I had played upon his wounded feelings Revived with the most vague and distant hope he impatiently drove me away on a search my own soul foreboded to be fruitless I even debated after I set out whether I should not loiter the time away in England till I could decently return from my  imaginary peregrination when a dream more pointed and singular than that I had feigned awakened in myself those hopes I had communicated to my Lord but I will not call it a dream since surely the event proves it a visitationOh gracious God what joy will my return pour into the hearts that now ach for either How pure will be the satisfaction derived from their acknowledgments"  During this long recital my tumultuous feelings pursued my love through every desperate situationMy woestruck heart hardly dared to breathe till finding him at last free and well it gave a deep sigh and respired without pain Essex insulted endangered imprisonedI cast my eyes round those gloomy walls I so late thought my prison and raising them to heaven adored the power who there confined me unconscious of the conflicts I could not have supported Ah Essex what were the warring elements the midnight  wreck the long long solitude the dire uncertainty I bad so bitterly bewailed to the single idea of seeing thee one moment at the mercy of Elizabeth one moment in the power of thy enemies And yet for me thy generous soul lost all sense of even these inflictions pride vanity and grandeur in vain assailed thee a true and noble passion beat unalterably at thy heart condensing in one favourite sorrow those mighty powers which once fulfilled every various and active duty of humanity  But this was not a moment for impassioned reveries Lady Southampton recalled my attention to the present moment and we employed it in informing Tracey of the name character and situation we had thought it prudent to assume as well as of those of our host Scarce was he master of these important particulars ere the Laird of Dornock returned and broke in upon us with an abruptness and anger he took no pains to disguise The sight of an English  officer a little abated his wrath Tracey according to the plan we had agreed on called Lady Southampton his sister and with every testimony of gratitude for the hospitable shelter our host had so long given us offered a recompence still more agreeable with which happily he had had the forecast to provide himselfWhile the Scot stood irresolute respecting his answer the wary Tracey turned to us and in an authoritative voice said he must answer to the Queen for his absence did it exceed the appointed time and therefore we must quickly take leave of our friends and hasten our departure for England This decisive speech increased the perturbation and disappointment already obvious in the features of our host nevertheless our going was to him so unforeseen an event that not being able to find a sufficient reason for detaining us he tacitly consented to it  My heart bounded at the unhopedfor liberation and I would have sailed that moment despite of wind and tide but  as the sailors declared this impossible our departure was delayed till the next morning Whether the various incidents of the day accelerated the hour appointed by nature or that Lady Southampton contrary to her own idea had reached it I know not she was seized at midnight however with the pains of labour and suffered so severely that her life was despaired of In the course of the ensuing day she was delivered of a dead child and I was obliged to console myself for the long delay this event must necessarily occasion in the pleasing idea that the partner of my fate was not prematurely divided from itin truth her vexation was so great that I was reduced to stifle my own lest I should contribute to her illness  The fate which hope yet gilds though but from the verge of the horizon is never quite insupportable We found in the protection of Tracey and the idea of rejoining the world to which he seemed our immediate link the means of beguiling many a tedious hour nor was  this consolation superfluous for the Laird of Dornock became from the moment of Tracey's arrival more sullen and impenetrable than everSelf was in him the prevailing principle Early invested with that bounded but absolute authority which oftener produces and shelters tyranny than a more extensive field of action he had hitherto known no oppositionHow often has a blind passion warped the noblest natures nor was it perhaps unnatural that he should stretch his prerogative to retain in his hands a lovely and beloved woman over whom he could claim no rightLong inured to fear suspicion and anguish they readily returned to their throbbing habitation my heart I often fancied I read murder written in dark but legible lines on the knit brow of our host and though Tracey slept only in an outer chamber close by us scarce could I persuade myself he was suffered to rest peaceably there or yet lived for our protection nevertheless I strove at times to reject those black chimeras a lively imagination perhaps too readily adopted  The Laird of Dornock no longer interfered with us or our fate neither did he withhold from us the company of his sisterThat sweet girl new to society with a romantic happiness peculiar to youth gifted every object with her own graces and virtues impressed at once with the merit of Tracey she transferred to a heart which could return it the passion I had unwarily inspired nor was her second choice unpropitious Tracey whose soul had expanded in a camp was yet to learn the inconceivable charm of love it took full possession of him With a sweet though sad pleasure I witnessed pure and innocent vows which continually reminded me of those days when like Phoebe I looked enraptured on the varied landscape of life yet glowing with the early beams of hope unconscious of the showers which often would fall the heavy nights which must wholly obscure it Tracey no less delighted than his mistress no longer hastened his departure to England and looked  astonished that we did not find every charm of existence in this dismal exile  I however anxiously waited with Lady Southampton the day when her recovered health should enable us to departIt came at length and we were eagerly preparing for the voyage when the Laird of Dornock sent us an order to read by which the King of Scots impowered him to detain us I know not any shock of all fate had imposed on me I ever felt more sensibly nevertheless I had presence of mind enough to observe by the date of this order that it had been obtained during the consinement of my friend The disappointment and despair this incident occasioned was only alleviated by the recollection that in abusing the authority of the King to indulge an unworthy inclination the Laird of Dornock had made himself responsible to the laws of his country for our safety by admitting that such persons were in his custody Tracey gave him notice of this immediately and though he moderated his rage in  consideration of the fair Phoebe he warned the Laird of Dornock to treat us nobly as he would answer it to his own King and the Queen of England in whose name we should soon be demanded To this indignant vaunt for in truth it was no better the haughty Scot coldly replied "that he should take his chance of incurring an old woman's anger who perhaps had already resigned all her rights to his master" Tracey could no longer controul the feelings of his generous soul and replied with acrimony The Laird of Dornock bad him profit by the occasion and be gone immediately if he did not mean to be included among the prisoners There wanted only this stroke to consummate our wretchedness and however reluctantly we lost our only friend and protector Lady Southampton joined me in arging him to go and overruling all his objections we hastened him alone into a bark which an hour before we seemed to see ourselves in He comforted us  with the assurance of soon returning being fully persuaded the King of Scots would never authorize so unjust and illegal a procedure when once the whole circumstance was impartially stated to him I sighed at remembering I knew him better but as an explanation at that moment was vain I urged not the unbounded influence of the fair Mabel through whose illicit connection with the King this order had doubtless been obtained How should that Monarch be convinced of a remote act of injustice who even at the moment of committing it was wronging every moral and religious duty The man who once voluntarily errs must either be weak or vicious in the first instance he resigns himself up to the passions of others in the latter to his own and in either case scarce ever recovers the narrow but even boundary of virtue  It was not by such means I hoped for freedomah no myviews all pointed to she lover to whom my heart like the needle  ever vibrated though far divided Let Essex be once informed sighed Ilet him once know where to find me and he would cross the globe to ensure my safety When the chagrin of this trying moment abated I called to mind the infinite relief the visit of Tracey had given our spirits and the change it had made in our situation by acquitting us of those petty obligations which always humiliate a noble mind unless it finds a congenial one in the bestower  I soon observed that the Laird of Dornock had not courage to profit by the base injustice he had committed The subservient situation Tracey placed himself in when we were present and the profound deference with which he obeyed our every wish neither agreeing with the rank we avowed nor the regimental he wore a vague idea of mystery had taken possession of our host's mind which wanted vigor and activity to attempt developing it Conscious too late that he had in releasing Tracey set a spy on his own  conduct he vainly regretted the timidity which prevented his detaining him He nevertheless at intervals still talked of love to Lady Southampton offering to buy a return by imaginary worlds of wealth for to us accustomed to elegance and luxury all his possessions appeared but a gaudy poverty As these ostentatious and absurd offers were one day made in my presence I could not but take some notice of them he silenced me however by replying I must be cautious how I exerted a spirit so likely to make him transfer his attachment and be satisfied with protecting one of the two since I could neither think so ill of his discernment or my own beauty as to believe him the dupe of my disguise As it was the first moment a doubt on the subject had ever transpired my confusion gave him instant conviction I could not recover myself sufficiently to reply for some moments at length I told him he had guessed the only part of our secret which did not lie too deep for his knowledge  nevertheless all he had discovered was but the least part of the mystery and finally that the day which informed him of our names and rank would call him to a severe account if his conduct were in the least unworthy either us or himselfI boldly affirmed that the only thing wanting to our safety was to have the Court of England informed of our asysum and now that was by Tracey's means ascertained we were not without noble friends to claim us The grandeur of air natural to me when insult roused my pride astonished and awed himhis mind laboured with vague and indistinct apprehensions and as all attempts at diving into a secret locked up solely in the hearts interested in retaining it must be vain he half repented having exerted an unjustifiable influence he could no longer hope to profit by  Lady Southampton acknowledged her obligations to my firmer spirit and both having no farther reason to affect subordination resumed the habits of rank  and distinction hiring domestics of our own till the moment of enfranchisement should arrive  Heartily weary of us both I often thought the Laird of Dornock meditated proposing to release us and while I was one day insensibly guiding him to that wishedfor point an order from Court was delivered into his hand Convinced it would liberate us I cast an eye of triumph on him while he opened it and saw his countenance confess the same idea but a moment caused a visible change in it He read the order aloud and we found with inexpressible astonishment that it contained the strictest charge to guard his English prisoners as he would answer it to his King yet with all due deferenceI eagerly caught at this article without seeming to notice the first which nevertheless sunk deep into my heart nor was his insensible to the latterThe weariness and disgust he had begun to indulge increased and his pride revolting at the idea that his castle was become a state prison and himself only  a jailer he felt every way irritated humiliated and offended No human being submits to power with so ill a grace as him who has unjustifiably exerted it and when its restrictions fall heavily on such mere retribution becomes in effect a severe revenge  A tedious interval had again clapsed without any news from England The tender timid Phoebe often persuaded herself her lover had never reached it and the singularity of finding ourselves apparently forgotten sometimes inclined my friend and self to unite with her in that opinionyet how many other causes might we reasonably assign for itcauses so much more afflicting that we recalled our thoughts to the isle for consolation  Whether the infinite variety the eternal transitions my own life had already afforded inclined me to hope on or whether the incessant prayers I addressed to him who alone could relieve me endued my mind with fortitude I knew not but I certainly found in it resources  hitherto unknown Every passing day seemed to refine and settle its powers and perceptions till those turbulent passions which of late rushed like a cataract through my frame now with a gentle healthful current gave motion to my pulses  We learnt from Phoebe that many letters came from Mabel to her elder brother the contents of which he so cautiously concealed as made it obvious we were their subject This news only confirmed us in the belief that Tracey had reached England safely and afforded us at the same time the flattering idea that our friends were anxiously labouring to recover us however their progress might be impeded by obstacles we could neither guess at nor decide upon nor were these suppositions vain An order at length arrived that we should be delivered to the officer who should present its counterpart Oh what joy what gratitude what anxiety did this prospect of a deliverance afford us From the dawn of the morning till night blackened the ocean did one or the other  watch with eager expectation the promised vesselWe beheld it at last and hardly could Essex himself have been more welcome to my eyes  Tracey once more landed and glad was the greeting on all sidesHe presented each of us lettersdear and precious characters my soul poured through my eyes when I again beheld them With lavish tenderness Essex hailed my second resurrection and vowed to shew his sense of the blessing by an implicit submission to my will"You shall no more complain of the terrors of a camp my love continued he I turn for ever from the bloody sceneA court no longer has any charms for me inspired with juster sentiments alive to purer pleasures in your heart and my own will I henceforth look for the wayward straggler happiness I am no longer my sweet Ellinor the Essex you have known I am become an absolute rustic a mere philosopher With you I will abjure the world and in some solitary spot devote myself to love and the sciences Oh  shut your heart like me my love to the past and look only towards the future I wait with impatience the news of your safe arrival in Cumberland and date from it our happiness"  These words were to my soul what the balmy breath of spring is to the frozen earth the winds at once cease to blow the snow sinks into her bosom the buds put forth their verdure and nature forgets she has suffered  Tracey came fraught with gifts rather suited to the spirit of the donor than that of the accepter yet they opened the heart of the Laird of Dornock who listened to the avowal of Tracey's love without repugnance and at length promised him his sister if at the expiration of two years his rank in the army entitled him to claim herThe tears of the young lovers for ever cemented those vows his will thus authorized Joy having disposed my heart to receive the soft impressions of every gentle passion extinguishing all that were not so I re  membered with astonishment the moment when I readily adopted the ambitious projects of EssexRank riches glory what are ye Gay ornaments which lend splendor indeed to felicity but which only incumber and weigh down the soul when struggling with the waves of misfortune gladly we lighten ourselves of such adventitious goods and grasp in tranquillity and love the unenvied but rich essence of all our fortune  In life as in a prospect we can long enjoy only a bounded view and all which presents either to the mind or eye a multiplicity of objects however great or beautiful overstrains the faculties and destroys the repose Rejecting at once every gaud vanity delights in from the distant throne and the mighty multitude ready perhaps in turn to conduct me to it my soul called forth the beloved individual and seating him at my side in a safe and humble solitude asked what we should lose by the change lose Ah rather what might we not gain How  sweet was it then to find Lord Essex himself at length cherished ideas wholly similar that weary of war ambition envy and all the turbulence of life in renouncing the court of Elizabeth he left with the power the wish of possessing itThat time solitude reflection disappointment itself had rather changed than extinguished his taste which thus regained its true bias seeking in the powers of the mind and the impulses of the heart a happiness not to be found on earth when those sources fail to supply it  In leaving forever the dreary scene of my exile I could be sensible of only one regret but flattering myself Tracey would ere long restore the sweet Phoebe to my friendship I soon dried up the tears due to the floods that charming girl bestowed upon our parting The rapid motion of the vessel bore no proportion to my impatience whenever I looked that detested isle was still in view I thought we should never lose sight of it  Oh how I anticipated the sweet repose which awaited us in the green solitudes of Cumberland I flattered myself Essex would already be there though Tracey assured me spies still followed his steps from which only a long confirmation of his peaceful intentions could relieve him  At length the pleasant shore of England was descried welcome to my heart was the shout which proclaimed it Our very souls shot through our eyes once more to hail our native country We found at the port servants and every accommodation that might render our journey easy Ah how beautiful was that journeya thousand various objects of simple majesty united to form one perfect whole and a new delight stole on every sense as we wound through varying vallies embowered by hanging woods reflected in many an expanse of clear water dim shadowed at intervals by mountains whose arid heights defied the sun they seemed to swell to  Far in these green labyrinths we came at once upon the Castle from whence I now writeIt is in fact only an elegant ruin and might rather be termed the residence of the anchorite Solitude In tearful gladness the fair owner threw her arms round my neck and blest the power which permited us at last to rest here  From this antique mansion do I date my narrative and in arranging it seek only to fill up those hours yet unblest with the presence of him born to fill every future one Dear Lady Pembroke I cannot express the divine repose which hushes at last my overworn facultiesI look back with wonder on all the past griefs the mortal conflicts my shattered frame has contended with So pure so perfect is now my grateful tranquillity that it seems proof even against misfortune itselfNo more shall my beating heart my burning brainbut why should I revert to such dismal recollections  Embosomed in the maternal arms of nature safe in the obscure and solitary  situation of this ivied asylum here my affrighted soul like a scared bird faintly folds up its weary wings delights to be alone and joys in mere safety I think I can never be happy be grateful enough and while my heart exhausts itself in enjoyment I still call on it for ebullitions to which it is unequal Pride passion vanity all the grosser particles of my nature are at once exhaled and every pure every social virtue unfolds and blossoms to the vernal sun forerunning even the snowdrop  Oh that radiant glorious luminary how new to me seems its influence Dark have been the films through which I have hitherto viewed it Pardon my darling friend these flights of fancy how playful does the mind grow when at peace with itself  Hasten generous Tracey hasten to my love and inform him of our arrival But is not Tracey already gone Oh hasten then my Essex quit that busy scene where virtue incessantly hovers on the verge of a precipice a thousand  ready hands would plunge her over partake with me the deep repose of thi solitudeno longer heed Elizabeth herself not even her power can reach us here Nature's gigantick phalanx impassable mountains present their formidable summits in long array overawing every inferior guard while in their vivid hollows happiness reposes on the bosom of her mother NatureOh come then and in  A life exempt from public haunt  Find tongues in trees books in the running streams  Sermons in stones and good in every thing  A thunderbolt falls on my brain avenging heaven why does it not wholly split it Triedsentencedcondemnedwhile I entombed in a now detested solitude gaily dreamt of endless happinessOh let me once more rush madly into the world overwhelm my agonized  senses with the shouts of armiesthe groans of the dyingfountains of blood rivers of tearsfind if possible a horror in nature may counteract that now raging in my soulThe wreck of the universe alone can equal itBut let me give the ruin scopewherefore wherefore should I wish it lessenedOh Lady Pembroke  LADY PEMBROKE WRITES  The trembling hand of the friend last invoked takes up the pen to finish the woes of a fair unfortunate who will never more be her own historianAlas they had now reached their climax  The eccentric turn of mind which made the sweet Ellinor form a plan so extraordinary as her supposed death and burial excited an astonishment in me its artful execution alone could increase Nevertheless the regular pursuit of a single idea was far from persuading her friends her intellects had recovered their tone or equality  When this heartbreaking narrative came to my hands I could not but observe that the sweet mistress of Essex had a very partial knowledge of his character or information of his actionsBlest with the most equitable and generous heart that ever actuated a human bosom his virtues often took a false colour from the selfish views of those who once found the way to it Credulity was so much his fault that even his enemies profited by it whom he always ceased to consider as such the moment they deigned to deceive him with a false protestation of regardIn fact the lenity of his nature continually counteracted that ambition which was its only vice and irradiated his character with the milder glories of humanity a lustre more soft pure and lasting than mere conquest can bestow Nevertheless the early habits of power and distinction had seized on his affections and even his love cooperating with that indulged foible they increased together The daring project he had formed was  no way unfeasible had he managed it with address for he possessed the hearts of the whole kingdom a few envious individuals excepted But art was unknown to Essex and those his superiority offended were proficients in that science unhappily too they were so immediately around the Queen that they could convert the suspicions she sometimes entertained of his conduct into certainty Yet so rooted was her love for this unfortunate favorite that it long contended with that she bore herself and tears of illjudged fondness often absorbed the bitterness his enemies would have wrought to his ruin Such a weakness alone could induce a sovereign wise and experienced like Elizabeth to delegate a power scarce inferior to her own into the hands of a Nobleman valiant popular and aspiring In consenting to Essex's command in Ireland the Queen made an absolute sacrifice of her own inclination which was only gratified when he was near her to his or perhaps in effect  both unconsciously yielded to the secret policy which invariably sought to separate themConvinced she had bound him to her by every tie of gratitude honor and confidence how must so high a spirit as that of Elizabeth be shocked wounded and irritated to see him loiter away his days inactively in Ireland regardless alike of her admonitions and the censures of the people Insensibly she imbibed the prejudices of the Cecil family the inflexible enemies of the Earl to whom she submitted the government of the state less from any esteem for their talents than the latent desire of piquing the negligent favorite to whom they were equally obnoxious Time confirmed to the Cecil faction the influence they at first owed solely to resentment The wearisome supineness of the Lord Deputy was at once succeeded by a suspicious and mysterious conduct His secret treaties with the arch rebel Tiroen the anonymous captive who seduced him into theseall was reported with aggravation  to Elizabeth The resentment occasioned by the error of his conduct was doubled when she knew that of his heart jealousy took full possession of hers and she determined to make him severely sensible of her power but she was told it was not safe at that period to recall him Obliged for the first time in her life to controul herself and meditate how to get him again into her power her temper became absolutely intolerable Her Ladies perserved a melancholy silence save the artful few instructed to foment and profit by her irritated passions The fate of Essex seemed wholly to depend on the event of a war hitherto unprosperous when to the astonishment alike of friends and enemies without performing any considerable exploit which might secure him a welcome the Earl posted suddenly home and presented himself before Elizabeth with the dauntless air of unblemished innocence Whether the surprize of the moment really revived that powerful passion of which  he had so long been the object or whether fear for her life made her dissemble the bitterness and rage swelling at her heart is a circumstance which never reached my knowledge It is certain the Queen received him graciously and listened to a very imperfect and incoherent defence of his conduct They parted friends and Essex instantly giving way to that credulity which so often made every talent art and nature could unite in his person abortive considered himself as effectually reestablished in her heart and indulged all the exultation such a triumph over his enemies could not fail to occasion  What a thunderstroke then was his immediate disgrace a disgrace he could not but impute to his own imprudence since in returning without advice he had delivered himself voluntarily into the hands of his enemies To the mortification of a long and humiliating imprisonment was shortly after superadded a killing grief in the supposed loss of the beauteous Ellinor  Resigning himself to a sullen and silent despair he no longer condescended to offer Elizabeth any further vindication of his conduct nor could be persuaded to make the least submission This concussion of feelings however shivered his animal no less than his mental system A fever followed which soon rose to a dangerous height Obstinately rejecting all medical advice he declared a thousand times he wished only to die nor had that wish been vain but that the Queen unable wholly to subdue the sentiments of tenderness which had so long reigned in her heart sent her own physician to attend him with offers of peace and pardon The desperate state in which he found the Earl was faithfully reported to Elizabeth who touched to the heart hesitated whether she should not revive him by an immediate visit so hard will it always be to counteract by political manoeuvres the genuine impressions of nature The Cecil party suddenly found themselves on the brink of ruin and  every argument fear pride or prudence could suggest was enforced to delay this interview Elizabeth vielded to the powerful combination of reasons in that instance but could not deny herself the pleasure of corresponding with Lord Essex as he grew better and soon suffered him to vindicate his conduct nay even condescended to reproach him with the unknown lady who had so fatally influenced it To this perplexing hint he replied his grief alone must answer and the melancholy tenour of his life so exactly agreed with this declaration that Elizabeth pressed no farther into a secret it was plain the grave now veiled rather seeking by kindness to invigorate a mind illfortune had borne too hard upon  It was now the shining time in the life of Essex The purple torrent of successful war had hitherto swept away or sunk those sweet humanities those social virtues time at length cast up in the vale of adversityEndued with eloquence  taste science sense and sensibility he now resigned himself to the charms of philosophy poesy and the mathematicks Innocent and tranquil resources to which the mind must ever turn when disappointed if blest with powers capable of relishing them The Cecils never thought Essex more dangerous Age and infirmity now made Elizabeth anxious for peace abroad and tranquillity at home and there wanted only a meeting between her and the much altered Earl to reestablish him in her favour but that meeting his enemies entered into a league to prevent and began by winning Elizabeth's physician to order the Earl of Essex into the countryAn artifice so refined as his liberation was not immediately discovered to be policy by any party and the Queen lulled into a belief that she could honorably receive him when he should return suffered him to depart without an audience  Wearied of wars camps and political jealousies and discussions the melancholy  Essex desired in freedom only the solitude he found when Tracey returned with the astonishing news that the mistress he still adored yet existedFatal news to his future reposeThe impossibility of openly claiming Ellinor revived with his passion all his dangerous and precarious projectsEvery other effort to obtain her was made without success ere he secretly applied to the King of Scots who always knew his own interest too well to grant any favour without having secured an adequate return James ardently desired to be nominated as the successor of Elizabeth by herself and had not spared bribes promises or flattery to interest those around her whom he thought likely to influence her choice The unhoped solicitation of the man whose courage and ambition James most feared was a circumstance of importance Uninformed of the real name or characters of the prisoners Lord Essex so eagerly desired to recover the King of Scots sent the Laird of Dornock notice to guard them more strictly The vehement tem  per of Essex made him always resign to the prevailingobject every other interest but a treaty like this could not be carried on so secretly as to escape the suspicious eyes of the ministers With what malignant joy did they silently watch its progress till the moment when its publication would inflame the Queen to their wishes  Essex now once more thought it his interest to be busy admired and popular he relapsed into all his old habits and having gained the Queen's permission returned to London Far however from profiting by this indulgence to obtain her pardon he remained at home throwing open his doors to all impoverished officers and clergy among whom a number of spirited adventurers appeared whose lavish praises seemed to render his popularity greater than ever  Elizabeth with disgust beheld him assume the favor she perhaps intended once more to bestow and kept in silence a strict watch upon his conduct By a  refinement known only in politicks his enemies scattered among his partizans many creatures of their own instructed to dive into all his intentions and spread abroad seditious and treasonable projects as though intrusted by himself with such This malice was but too successfulInflated with the adulation of misjudging friends the extravagant admiration of the multitude and the insidious attacks of his enemies the selfdeluded Essex sprung the mine himself which destroyed him  The mischief commenced by a broil between the Lords Southampton and Grey the last assaulting the former in the street and though the offender was ceremoniously punished the spirit of party broke out in a thousand little daily quarrels The Queen already persuaded that Essex ever haughty and impetuous scorned her power despised her person and only waited a favorable moment openly to insult both was irritated beyond all bearing by the artful  covery at this cruel crisis of his secret treaty with the King of ScotsIts real cause was unknown to her and the offence though trifling in itself of a nature most likely to exasperate a Sovereign whose eyes were ever turned from a successor she refused to acknowledge The discovery proved decisiveElizabeth instantly resolved to deliver the ungrateful favorite up to the laws of his country and authorized a judicial enquiry into his conduct The Cecil party desired no more for well they knew Essex would rather die than brook the deliberate indignity The commissioned Lords assembled at his house on a Sunday as the time when they should be most safe from the insults of the partial populaceThey found the Earl sufficiently inflamed who swearing he never more would be a voluntary prisoner shut up the Lord Keeper and the rest in his own house rushing forth armed and followed only by a few friends and  domestics to claim the protection of the people  By a fatality not peculiar to himself the bubble popularity which had so long swelled and glittered before his mistaken eyes burst at once and left to him a vacuum in natureThe sacred day was but too judiciously chosen by his enemieswithout preparationalmost without a friend the unhappy Essex rushed through the streets of London crouded only with peaceful and humble mechanics who emerged from every close lane environed by their wives and children to enjoy the weekly holidayTo people of this stamp the gallant Essex was almost unknowncertainly indifferent with stupid and curious eyes they turned to gaze on those warlike steps none ventured to followsteps which bore the noble Essex so fast toward ruin Distress however only increased his desperation and the citizens being spirited into making an ineffectual effort to prevent his return a skirmish  ensued The amiable Tracey had the fate he desired and fell at the side of his Lord who even in this cruel moment dropt a tear on a youth so beloved Fame honor happiness nay even life were fleeting fast from Essex and however careless of these goods friendship still asserted her rights over his feelingsIn compassion to the few generous adherents who must have fallen in his cause had he longer resisted the Earl at length surrendered his sword  All was now over with this admired and erring favoriteImprisoned in the Tower he had ample leisure to reconsider the events which brought him thereThe desertion of the people had opened his eyes to the realities of lifeHe too sensibly found while he ministered to their necessities their pride or their pleasures the multitude could rend the air with acclamations but the moment a claim was in turn made on their feelings they always become cold torpid and inanimate He perceived with  vain regret that he had been duped into this outrage on the laws of society by the manoeuvres of his enemies no less than the credulity of his heart But he was not formed to profit by these humiliating discoveries they impressed a nature so upright only with the deepest disgustHe was however consoled with remembering selfpreservation was the sole motive for his daring attack and that no action of his life had yet violated the duty he had sworn the Queen He resolutely prepared himself to meet the judgment of his peers and only lamented the friendship which involed the generous Southampton in his fate who shared without regret the prison of a friend so dear  The Queen meanwhile experienced every emotion such a painful contrariety of passions must necessarily occasionThe imprisonment of her favorite as usual seemed to cancel his offence but he was now beyond her jurisdiction and the victim of the laws She had unhappily  surrendered him up to them and robbed herself of every prerogative but that of pardoning a prerogative she feared so high a spirit would never sollicit her to exertShe regretted too late having driven him to so dangerous an extreme and while his fate was yet uncertain suffered more perhaps than he did in its completion  The friends of the Earl persuaded no kind of influence would be spared to bring him to the block were unanimous in intreating him to win over the Queen by an early repentance and submission but they knew not the grandeur of the heart they would have humbledBorn to distinguish himself most eminently when outward distinctions were withdrawn it was then only Essex seemed to use his better judgment "Can any one call himself my friend would he indignantly exclaim and yet wish me poorly to petition for an obscure an ignominious life What to pine away the flower of manhood in infamy and solitude shunned by all yet unstigmatized by public justice  and shunning in turn the exalted characters I dare no longer emulateShut up with those tormenting companions my own thoughts till led perhaps by desperation to inflict that fate upon myself I have meanly evaded receiving from the lawNo my friends I am enthralled here as a traitorif proved one it is fit I expiate my crime and if acquitted I know the value of a life ventured hitherto only for my country"Neither arguments or intreaties could shake his resolution and he heard with unequalled firmness that public sentence from which he still persisted there was no appeal In vain every dear and affecting image was pourtrayed in the strongest colours before his active imaginationFrom that of the woestruck Ellinor liberated too late and weaving in a distant solitude a thousand fairy bowers for love and happiness to dwell infrom her alone his nature shrunk "You may wound my heart would he sighing say through every vein but my reason is still inflexible nor is even that sweet  creature an argument for my submitting to disgraceNo when I raised my eyes to thee dear Ellinor my conscious soul beheld in itself all that could intitle me to mate with theeI cannot resolve to look up even to the woman I adoreBetter she should weep me dead than secretly despise me while yet existingPure and precious will be the tears that fall upon my grave but never could I behold one which would not secretly reproach meLeave me my friends to my fate honor has hitherto been the invariable rule of my conduct nor can I now adopt another"  From the moment the condemnation of Essex reached the Queen peace and rest were strangers to herThe chosen of her heart was now the victim of the laws and that heart must bleed through his unless he could be induced to throw himself on her mercy A thousand emissaries assured him of a ready pardona word a wish would have obtained itTo these he ever replied with the same collected  air "that had the Queen earlier shewn him this indulgence his life had never come within the censure of the law but as even her utmost bounty now could only prolong to him the liberty of breathing he was willing as well for her safety as in submission to his sentence to resign a privilege which became a burthen the moment it was his only one" An answer thus calculated to touch the most indifferent heart stabbed that of Elizabeth yet as unasked to grant him a pardon would stamp her declining life with inexcusable weakness she underwent every hour the most trying conflicts  Ah why do I say the most trying alas there was a fair and forlorn one buried in Cumberland who more than died when this cruel intelligence reached her As the sentence of Essex included his friend Southampton the relations of the latter dispatched an express to his wife hoping she would arrive in London time enough to sollicit his pardon of the  Queen The messenger found the unfortunate Ladies buoyed up with safety solitude and many a gentle hope When the approach of horses echoed through the remote valley no other emotion was excited in either than the fond and latent flutter arising from the idea that it might be one or both of the condemned EarlsHow terrible was then the transition in their minds when fully informed of their desperate situation and bereft of every resource expected misery supplies The unhappy wife of Southampton engrossed by her own share in the affliction observed not its deep its deadly effect on the intellects of her equally suffering friend till the stupefaction of Ellinor became intense and obvious and the evil irremediable  The human mind even when most elevated is not equal to the influence of two opposing passionsa sacrifice must be made and friendship yields to love Lady Southampton posted away with unremitting diligence intrusting her  friend to the care of faithful servants who were directed to bring her forward more leisurelyThe deep gloom of the sweet Ellinor's mind in the course of the journey gave way to a vague and irregular gaiety but as this had sometimes forerun her recovery so might it then had she been surrounded with such persons as knew her dispositionThose who had her in charge uninformed of her name situation and wounded spirit could not reasonably be expected to guard against events they could not possibly foresee It happened one day while they were resting Ellinor cast her eyes upon an extensive building full in sight and her wandering imagination called it KenilworthAn officious attendant informed her it was Fotheringay CastleShe wildly shrieked stretched forth her arms expressively towards the fatal mansion then tearing those lovely tresses once before devoted to her calamity and scarce grown to their usual luxuriance threw herself on the ground and relapsed into total insanity  But when Lady Southampton entered the prison of her Lord upon whose aching bosom she poured forth all her grief and passion his disturbed friend found every fibre of his heart wrung and turning a fearful eager eye toward the door felt a horror not to be expressed at finding no one followed herThe afflicted wife wanted presence of mind to conceal a truth which consummated the fate of Essexa truth so terrible that fain would he have believed it invented by his friends to reconcile him to his sentenceConvinced at length"now indeed do I feel the weight of my bondsnow indeed am I a prisoner would he exclaimOh Ellinor matchless Ellinor that I could fly to thee recall once more that unequalled soul which always like a frightened bird forsakes its home when misery hovers over itThou thou hast broken a spirit equal to every other afflictionthou hast made a coward of meto save thee my love I could almost resolve poorly to condition for a disgraceful life and wish to survive my honor"  Persuaded his presence would have the same effect it once before took at St Vincent's Abbey he passionately sollicited to see her This single idea seized upon his mindit even became his solemn requesthis dying wish In the hopeless state of her disorder the effect of their meeting was dreaded only on his account but as all intreaty and argument proved vain his friends at length resolved to yield to his passionate his only sollicitation The day was now appointed for the execution of Essex and the pardon of Southampton granted which alone he desired as all his friends were freely admitted to his prison there was no difficulty in leading thither the darling of his heart in the habit of a youth accompanied by Lady SouthamptonWorlds could not have bribed  me  to witness such an interview Ah dearest Ellinor were those senses they so eagerly desired to restore to thee in reality a loss How had they been perfect wouldst thou have supported the trying scene expiring  love and officious friendship dragged thee to witnessHow wouldest thou have fixed thine eyes on the gloomy tower or those guarded gates through which thy lover must so soon be borne but never more should passHow must thy soul have bled to behold those fine features a few hours were to separate from the heart which then gave them such agonized expression But that superlative misery was not ordained theeRetired beyond the reach of love itself were all the various powers of that susceptible soulThy vague eyes confessed not their everlasting objectthy ear caught not his voicenor did thy bosom answer with a single sigh the bursts of grief which struggled at that of thy lover still exquisitely alive to every human affliction To thee his parting soul yet clung and when his eyes beheld thee no longer they willingly shut out creation He saw not from the moment of Ellinor's departure friend or relation but turning all his contemplations towards  the awful futurity in which he was so soon to launch died to this world even before his execution  On the night which preceded that event this billet equally addressed to my sister with whom the dear unfortunate resided and myself was delivered  "Dear generous guardians of the lost angel my soul yet bleeds over receive in this my parting blessing and pardon oh pardon an incredulity but too severely punished by conviction a conviction so terrible as reconciles me to the death tomorrow will bestow Yes these eyes have been blasted with beholding the pale statue of my love dead while yet breathingspeechlessinsensateTo the gathered multitudethe fatal scaffoldthe axe which separates soul and body I turn for relief when this remembrance presses upon me  "Adieu ye faithful sisters of the gallant SydneyOh if intelligence too late should visit the fair form bequeathed to your friendship with sympathy soothe every aching senseYet wake no  more to woe my worshiped EllinorStill may thy pure spirit slumber in its breathing tomb till that appointed hour which at length unites thee to thy ESSEX"  Tower  It seemed as if in this epistle were enclosed every lingering weakness of mortality for the remaining hours of his life were devoted solely to the duties of religionIn the flower of manhood at the age of three and thirty this envied favorite resigned every earthly distinction and ascended the scaffold with a composure innocence and Heaven alone can bestow The melting multitude too late bewailed to see his glorious youth set thus in bloodHis ear caught the general murmur of sorrow and applause he cast a look of corrected knowledge on the spectators then lifting his eyes to Heaven serenely submitted to the executioner who severed a head and heart which had they acted in unison might have awed the world  Of her so much beloved so generously so fatally faithful little more remains to be saidNeither time care or medicine ever availed toward the restoration of those intellects which might only have proved an additional misfortuneYet even in this state of insanity Heaven permitted her to become the instrument of a singular and exemplary vengeance A year or more had elapsed during which her calamity took all those variable and dreadful forms peculiar to itselfThe desire of having every medical assistance made me bring her with me to London where one evening with a degree of reflection and art often blended with insanity she eluded the care of her attendants and well knowing every avenue of the palace passed them all with wonderful facility  The Queen wholly sunk in the chilling melancholy of incurable despair and hopeless age resigned herself up to the influence of those evilsHer ladies were often employed in reading to her which was the only amusement her chagrin admittedOne memorable  night it was my turnElizabeth dismissed every other attendant in the vain hope of finding a repose of which she had for ever deprived herself I pursued my task a long while when the time conspired with the orders of the Queen to produce a silence so profound that had not her starts now and then recalled my senses hardly could my halfclosed eyes have discerned the pages over which they wanderedThe door flew suddenly opena form so fairso fragileso calamitous appeared there that hardly durst my beating heart call it Ellinor The Queen started up with a feeble quickness but had only power to falter out a convulsive ejaculation I instantly remembered Elizabeth believed her dead and imagined this her spectre The beauteous phantom for surely never mortal looked so like an inhabitant of another world sunk on one knee and while her long garments of black flowed gracefully over the floor she lifted up her eyes toward Heaven with that nameless sweetness that wild ineffable benignity madness  alone can give then meekly bowed before ElizabethThe Queen heartstruck fell back into her seat without voice to pronounce a syllableEllinor arose and approached still nearer standing a few moments choaked and silent "I once was proud was passionate indignant" said the sweet unfortunate at last in the low and broken voice of inexpressible anguish" but Heaven forbids me now to be soOh you who was surely born only to chastize my unhappy race forgive meI have no longer any sense but that of sorrow"Again she sunk upon the floor and gave way to sobbings she struggled in vain to suppress The Queen dragged me convulsively to her and burying her face in my bosom exclaimed indistinctly "save mesave meoh Pembroke save me from this ghastly spectre""EssexEssexEssex" groaned forth the prostrate Ellinor expressively raising her white hand at each touching repetitionThe violent shudderings of the Queen marked  the deep effect that fatal name took on her "Somebody told me continued the lovely wanderer that he was in the Tower but I have looked there for him till I am wearyis there a colder safer prison then But is a prison a place for your  favorite  and can you condemn him to the grave Ah gracious Heaven strike off his headhis beauteous headSeal up those sparkling eyes foreverOh no I thought not said she with an altered voiceSo you hid him  here  after all only to torment meBut Essex will not see me sufferwill you my Lord Sososo"the slow progress of her eyes round the room shewed she in imagination followed his steps"Yesyes added she with revived spirits I thought that voice would prevail for who could ever resist itand only I need die then well I do not mind thatI will steal into his prison and suffer in his place but be sure you don't tell him so for he loves  me  ah dearly does he love me but I alone need sigh at that you know"  And sigh she did indeedOh what a world of woe was drawn up in a single breathThe long silence which followed induced the Queen once more to raise her headthe same sad object met her eyes with this difference that the sweet creature now stood up again and putting one white hand to her forehead she half raised the other as earnestly demanding still to be heard though her vague eyes shewed her purpose had escaped her"Oh now I remember it resumed she I do not mind how you have me murdered but let me be buried in Fotheringay and be sure I have  women  to attend me  be sure  of thatyou know the reason" This incoherent reference to the unprecedented fate of her royal mother affected Elizabeth deeply"But could not you let me once more see him before I die resumed the dear wandererOh what pleasure would it give me to view him on the ThroneOh I  do  see him there exclaimed she in the voice of surprize and transport Benign majesticAh  how glorious in his beautyWho would not die for thee my Essex" "Alas never never never shall  I  see him" groaned forth the agonized Elizabeth "Me married to him resumed our friend replying to some imaginary speech oh no I took warning by my sisterI will have no more bloody marriages you see I have no ring wildly displaying her hands except a black one a  black  one indeed if you knew allbut I need not tell  you  thathave I my Lord look uphere is my lovehe himself shall tell you" She caught the hand terror had caused Elizabeth to extend but faintly shrieking drew back her own surveying it with inexpressible horror "Oh you have dipt mine in blood exclaimed she a mother's blood I am all contaminatedit runs cold to my very heartAh no it isit is the blood of Essex and have you murdered him at last in spite of your dotage and your promises murdered the most noble of mankind and all because he  could not love you Fye on your wrinklescan one love age and uglinessOh how those artificial locks and all your paintings sickened himHow have we laughed at such preposterous follyBut I have done with laughing nowwe will talk of graves and shrouds and churchyardsMethinks I fain would know where my poor sister lies buriedyou will say in my heart perhapsit has indeed entombed all I love yet there must be some little unknown corner in this world one might call her grave if one could but tell where to find it there she rests at last with her Leicesterhe was your  favorite  tooa bloody bloody distinction" The Queen who had with difficulty preserved her senses till this cutting period now sunk back in a deep swoon  The distress of my situation cannot be expressedFearful lest any attempt to summon a single being should irritate the injured Ellinor to execute any dire revenge for which I knew not how she  was prepared had not Elizabeth at this juncture lost her senses I really think mine would have failed me I recollected that the Queen by every testimony was convinced the unhappy object thus fearfully brought before her died in the country long since nor was it wise or safe for those who had imposed on her now to acknowledge the deception "Sososo cried Ellinor with a start would one have thought it possible to break that hard heart after all and yet I have done itShe is gone tono not gone to Essex" "Let us retire my sweet Ellen" said I eager to get her out of the room lest the Queen should suffer for want of assistance"Hush cried she with increasing wildness they will say we have beheaded her alsoBut who are you fixing her hollow eyes wistfully on me I have seen you somewhere ere now but I forget all faces in gazing on his pale oneI know not where I am nor where you would have me go added she softly sighing but you look like an angel of light and may be you will carry  me with you to Heaven" I seized the blessed minute of compliance and drawing her mourning hood over her face led her to the little court where my servants waited my dismission when committing her to their charge I returned to wake the ladies in the antichamber through whose inadvertent slumbers alone Ellinor had been enabled to pass to the closet of the Queen a circumstance which combined with a variety of others to give this strange visitation the appearance of being supernatural  Every common means were tried in vain to recover the Queen and the applications of the faculty alone could recall her senses but the terror she had endured has shook them forever Shuddering with apprehensions for which only I can account she often holds incomprehensible conferences complains of an ideal visitor commands every door to be shut yet still fancies she sees her and orders her to be kept out in vain The supposed disregard of those in waiting incenses a temper so many causes concur  to render peevish and her unmerited anger produces the very disregard she complains of Rage and fear unite thus to harrass her feeble age and accelerate the decay of nature When these acute sensations subside grief and despair take possession of her whole soulnor does she suffer less from the sense of her decaying power Unwilling to resign a good she is unable to enjoy she thinks every hand that approaches is eager to snatch a sceptre she will not even in dying bequeath Oh sweet Matilda if yet indeed thou survivest to witness this divine vengeance thy gentle tears would embalm even thy most mortal enemy thou couldst not without pity behold the imperial Elizabeth lost to the common comforts of light air nourishment and pleasure That mighty mind which will be the object of future as it has been of past wonder presenting now but a breathing memento of the frailty of humanityAh that around her were assembled all those aspiring souls whose wishes center in dominion  were they once to behold this distinguished victim of ungoverned passion able to rule every being but herself how would they feel the potent example Ah that to them were added the many who scorning social love confine to self the blessed affections which alone can sweeten the tears we all are born to shedGathering round the weary couch where the emaciated Queen withers in royal solitude they might at once learn urbanity and correct in time errors which when indulged but too severely punish themselves  Absorbed and blended in the busy and woeful scenes this heartbreaking history presented to my mindan anxious partaker in each succeeding calamityI seemed to live over again the melancholy years we had been separated in the person of my sisterMy own misfortunesmy darling daughter the whole world vanished from before my eyesdeepfixed  on objects no longer existing or existing but to double my affliction I remained almost the statue of despair every sense seeming rivetted on the manuscript I held and buried in so profound a reverie that Lady Arundell judged it prudence to interrupt it The consolatory reflections her friendship dictated died on my ear but reached not a heart which deeply pursued the sad chain of ideas thus presented to itStarting as from a frightful sleep I at last sunk on my knees and raising my eyes with the manuscript at once toward Heaven"Oh mighty author of universal being sighed I thou who hast lent me fortitude to struggle with almost unequalled trials support my exhausted soul against this lastthis greatestLet not the killing idea that it is a  human  infliction trouble the pure springs of piety whence alone the weary spirit can draw consolationRather strengthen me with the holy belief that it is thy visitation for some wise end ordained  so shall my enemies sleep in their graves uncursed and my heart remain in this agitated bosom unbroken Alas who knows but by thy divine appointment I may be at last permitted to recall the scattered senses of this dear unfortunate to soothe that deeplywounded that embittered spirit Ah Ellen Ah my sister groaned I deluged at last with salutary tears changedlostannihilated as thou art my unaltered affection must ever desire theeI need not enquire whether she is hereyour sympathizing generous tears dear Lady Arundell inform me that the same roof shelters the twin heirs of misfortune"  Although Lady Arundell acknowledged that my sister was under her protection fain would she have persuaded me to delay a meeting so touching till more able to support it but deaf to the voice of reason nature powerful nature asserted her rights and my soul obeyed her impassioned impulse The deep the eternal impression of this agonizing meeting recurs even now with all its first  force I had shuddered at the murder of my motherI had groaned on the coffin of my husbandI had wept a thousand times over the helpless infant who trembled at my bosombut all these terrible sensations were combined when my sad eyes rested on those still so dear to me When I saw all their playful lustre quenched and set in insensibilitywhen I felt that heart once the seat of every feminine grace and virtue throb wild and unconscious against one which I thought every moment would escape from its narrow boundaryBut let me quit a scene too trying for recollectiontoo touching for description Oh Ellinor my sister  THE RECESS c  PART VI  TIME which inures us to every kind of suffering at length strengthened my mind against the heavy sadness impressed on it by the fate of this dear unconscious sufferer Slowly I ventured to ponder on the past to meditate the future It was with true gratitude and concern I learnt Heaven had called to itself the amiable and accomplished sister of Lady Arundell who caught a cold during  her attendanee on the sick Queen which ended in a consumption and carried her off a few months after Elizabeth Actuated to the last by the sublimest sympathy and friendship Lady Pembroke had added to the moiety of the surveyor's treasure which she had caused to be dug for in the spot specified a sufficient sum to secure the dear unfortunate every comfort her forlorn state admitted placing with her Alithea the favorite maid she had so tenderly commemorated and committed both to the charge of Lady Arundel who with equal generosity received so anxious a trust A virtue thus consummate sanctifies itself and can receive neither glory or grace from the gratitude of humanity yet surely the incense of the heart arises even to Heaven accept it then oh gentlest of the Sydneys although insphered there  The strange and unaccountable difference in my sister's opinion and my own respecting Lord Leicester supplied me a source of endless meditation yet as this difference became obvious only from  the time we arrived in London I could not help imputing her blindness to the same cause she assigned for mineCertainly she imbibed the unreasonable prejudices of Lord Essex whose ambition however fatally expiated always inclined him to dislike a Nobleman born to supersede him I saw but too plainly from the irritation and vehemence to which her temper from that period became subject how much a woman insensibly adopts of the disposition of him to whom she gives her heart I had not however looked on her choice with the contemptuous asperity with which she regarded mineLord Essex I will frankly own ere yet he rose into favor was gifted like herself with every captivating advantage of natureThe fire and ingenuousness which afterwards marked his character then lived only in his eyes and the cultivated understanding he possessed pointed every glance with elegance and expression One must have loved Lord Leicester to see Essex with indifferenceone must have loved him to the excess  I did perhaps not to remark the attachment my sister avowedInnumerable instances of it now flashed on my memory I was astonished could at the moment escape me If  she  was indeed more clear sighted than myselfBut why do I enter on so vain a discussionAlas dear Ellinor beloved Leicester I have no right but to lament ye  I had likewise gathered another painful doubt from the story of my sister England had gained a King in the son of Mary Stuart but her unfortunate daughters must not hope to acquire a brother From the moment I had been informed mine had acceded to the throne the tender mother's heart had fluttered with the idea of presenting to him that lovely girl so nearly allied to his blood Although regardless of distinction in my own person I could not turn my eyes on the fair daughter of Lord Leicester without coveting for her every human advantageUnwilling to be swayed by prejudice I separately consulted with the  few friends fortune had left me who all concurred in giving me an impression of the King degrading if not contemptible They represented him as national vain pedantick credulous and partial wanting generosity to bestow a royal funeral on the body of the martyred saint his unhappy mother yet daily impoverished to meanness by favorites and parasites Enslaved by the imperious spirit of a Queen he neither loved nor valued and only endeared to the people he governed through the fickleness of their natures which are always gratified by change As those who spoke thus could have no possible interest in villifying or depreciating him I could not but give some credit to their account and made it my first concern to see the King anxious to read in his countenance a confutation of every charge How unaccountably was I disappointed when my senses took part with his enemiesI beheld with astonishment in the person of James youth without freshness royalty without  grandeur height without majestyan air of slyness and a secret servility characterized features which though devoid of the graces of either distinguished parent wanted not regularity and a stooping slouch gait gave an invincible awkwardness to a figure nature had endued with symmetry Offended and repelled my heart sunk again into its own little mansion nor claimed the least alliance with hisI determined to watch at leisure his real character and conduct nor ventured to confide to his care the single treasure Heaven had permitted me to retain of all it once bestowed Resolved to educate my daughter suitably to the fortune she was born to I thought it wise to bury in my own bosom at least for a time the secret of her right to it and the eccentric turn of mind every succeeding day rendered more obvious in the King made me continually applaud the moderation and foresight which guarded me on this interesting occasion  I however judged it necessary to assume a title no human being envied or offered to dispute with me and to support it properly without encroaching on my daughter's valuable acquisition I found I must resolve to revisit Kenilworth Castle now the property of another familyIn the building were contained cabinets so secure and unknown that Lord Leicester always deposited there ere he journeyed to London such papers jewels and other valuables as he thought it unsafe to take with him On the memorable night when last we quitted that pleasant dwelling I had assisted him to place in the most curious of these reservoirs several caskets for which he seemed more than commonly anxious and I added to their number that containing Mrs Marlow's papers and the testimonials of my birth As if actuated by some sad presentiment that he should never more revisit this spot my Lord took great pains to familiarize me to the management of the springs and gave into my hands duplicates of the  keys By a singular chance amidst all the transitions of my fate these keys remained and seemed continually to remind me how important to my daughter's welfare it might one day be to recover the casketsA motive strong as this alone could conquer the reluctance I felt again to behold a spot sacred to the memory of a husband so beloved You will call this perhaps a childish weakness after all I had borne but alas the mind feebler and feebler from every conflict sometimes sinks under a trifle after repelling the more powerful attacks of illfortune with magnanimity  Lady Arundel with her usual kindness proposed accompanying me and we sorrowfully measured once more those miles which so strongly revived in my mind the most interesting remembrances At Coventry we rested to enquire into the character of the present owner of Kenilworth Castle We were told that this magnificent mansion I had left fit for the reception of a Sovereign had long been in the hands  of a miser whose avarice had induced him to strip it of its princely ornaments not less from the desire of converting those into money than to deprive it of every charm that might tempt the enquiring traveller to knock at the inhospitable gate Yet even when this ruin was effected the structure itself was so complete a piece of architecture as to attract a number of unwelcome visitors to exclude whom he had now let it to some manufacturers and resided himself in a remote apartment The chagrin this extraordinary revolution could not but occasion in my mind was increased when I recollected how hard it would be perhaps to gain admission and even when that was obtained we knew not whether the only room I wished to lodge in was now habitable Lady Arundell with her usual foresight advised me to seem to have no other motive for this visit than a desire to repurchase the Castle and when shewn through it to appear to be struck with so severe an indisposition as soon as I reached the  chamber which contained the cabinets as should render it impossible to remove me leaving it to her to reconcile the owner to so troublesome an intruder by the most lavish generosity A finesse of this kind alone could ascertain me any success and the sickliness of my aspect I was sure would sufficiently corroborate such an assertion  We set out immediately that by arriving in the evening we might have a pretence for passing the night there My soul turned from the wellknown scene and sickened alike at sight of the reviving verdure and the splendid mansion to me alas only a gay mausoleum Humbly I sollicited entrance at a gate which once flew open whenever I appeared but ah though the exterior was the same how strange seemed the alteration withinNo more did the liveried train of assiduous domestics assemble to the distant winding of the huntsman's hornNo longer did I rest in gilded galleries whose pictured sides delighted one sense while their coolness refreshed  another No longer could I even in idea behold the beloved the noble owner whose gracious mien endeared the welcome it conveyedA change which jarred every feeling had taken place A numerous body of diligent mechanics were plodding in those halls were Elizabeth had feasted and their battered sides hardly now informed us where the rich tapestry used to hang My ears were suddenly stunned with the noise of a hundred looms and the distant lake once covered with gay pageants and resounding only to the voice of pleasure presented us another scene of industry not less busy strange and surprizing By incidents of this kind one becomes painfully and instantaneously sensible of advancing into life When first we find ourselves sailing with the imperceptible current of time engrossed either by the danger of our situation or enchanted with its prospects we glide swiftly on scarce sensible of our progress till the stream revisits some favorite spot alas so visible is the desolation of the shortest interval that we  grow old in a moment and submit once more to the tide willing rather to share the ruin than review it  Among the few servants retained by the meagre master of this desolated mansion one appeared who immediately recalled himself to my mind by the name of Gabriel I recollected his having been warden of the outer lodges The title by which I was announcedthe weed I still continued to wear overcame one already bowed to the earth by age infirmity and penury and when to these circumstances was superadded the remembrance of the plentiful and peaceful days he had known under a Lord ever munificent to his domestics gratitude became agony and the poor old man sunk in a fit at my feet An incident like this might well have affected an indifferent spectatorI was scarce more sensible than himself and the alarm soon spread through the laborious mechanics till it was conveyed to Sir Humphry MoretonTimorously he emerged from  his apartment and as the humble croud made way for him he measured me afar off with his eye and seemed lost in conjecture on the subject of my visitMy purse was yet in my hand and part of its contents in those of some persons who had lent a ready assistance Whether this or the wan delicacy of my looks interested him I know not but every carefurrowed feature gradually relaxed as he approached me striving in vain to soften into the smile of benevolence I rose to return his courteous salutation and informed him that when last I past the walls of this Castle I was its mistress the dear and happy wife of Lord Leicester but perceiving uncertain apprehensions of some remote claim began again to contract his brow I added that sensible I had lost every right in a spot yet dear to me I came to enquire whether he was disposed to part with it and to rescue from poverty such worthy servants of its late noble owner as had alike outlived their labour and him who should have recompensed it  What heart is insensible to that virtue in which we alone can resemble our MakerBenevolence like religion awes even those it cannot win The miser loudly applauded my liberality and by a greater effort on his part allowing for the difference of our characters invited me to spend the night in the Castle The chamber I had been accustomed to inhabit he called his best and thither was I conducted I was not unprovided with the means of ensuring my own welcome and my servants having spread the cold viands we brought Sir Humphry's spirits grew light over luxuries he was not to pay for A temptation so agreeable prolonged his stay and I at length discovered the only way to shorten his visit would be to compliment him with all that remained seeing my servants in compliance with the hint were about to convey it out of the room fear lest any should be lost by the way prevailed over the hilarity  of the moment and he departed with the wine  With an impatient beating heart I raised the tapestry which providentially had been preserved in this room less from its beauty than antiquity as it was so worn that it had long been pannelled in many placesBehind the bed we discovered the secret spring of the cabinet which I opened without any difficulty and with the assistance of Lady Arundell took down the wellremembered caskets pausing at intervals to weep over all the tender ideas the sight of them recalled so forcibly to my memory then raising my eye toward Heaven while devoutly thanking the God who thus prospered my remaining wishes I almost fancied I beheld the beatified spirit of him who concealed these treasures  Lady Arundell would not rest without inspecting their contents The largest was filled with family papers bonds contracts mortgages many of which were to me unintelligible and all useless  The next contained letters and little ornaments less precious from their intrinsic value than their analogy to particular eventsUnder these was a gilt casket filled with jewels of great value and what was of infinitely more the authenticated bonds and acknowledgments of all the sums Lord Leicester had informed me he had providentially deposited in other countries and of which I knew not any memorandum remained This was so noble an addition to the bequest which already enriched my sweet Mary that it seemed to me her father even from the grave delighted to endow her while the Almighty gracious even when we think him most severe had thu  secreted for her advantage treasure it would have been impossible for me to have preserved through so many desperate vicissitudes  The next casket was a gift from the fond mother to the darling of her heart it contained all the testimonials of the Queen of Scots and other parties concerned  on the subject of my birth with the contract of marriage between Lord Leicester and myself I felt rich in these recovered rights and though prudence might never permit me to claim alliance with King James yet to bequeath to my daughter the power of doing so at whatever period it should appear advantageous was a great consolation to me  Lady Arundell and I past part of the night in packing these valuables in empty trunks brought for that purpose then closing the secret cabinet and leaving no traces of our search for it we retired to rest We departed early the next morning carrying with us that ancient domestic of Lord Leicester on whom memory had so powerfully operated and two others who long since expelled from the Castle sought a miserable subsistence in the hamlets around it It joyed my very heart to supply to these poor wretches a loss irremediable with respect to myself and the profound attachment of their  few remaining days amply rewarded me  Through the intervention of the friends I yet possessed some eminent merchants in London undertook to get the bonds notes c duly acknowledged and in process of time such considerable sums were of consequence recovered as ascertained to myself and child our accustomed affluence Years and misfortune had only cemented the ancient friendship between me and Lady ArundellI added my income and family to hersHer house was fortunately so near London as to allow me the advantage of procuring the first instructors for my daughter and the infirm state of Lady Arundell's health rendering her as much a prisoner from necessity as I was from choice both insensibly found in the improvement of my daughter a mild and growing satisfaction which more than made amends for the world we shut out  Ah could I desire a greater pleasure Pardon madam the fond extravagance  of maternal love and allow me to present to you the darling of my heart in her sixteenth year Already something taller than myself to a form that united the strictest symmetry with the wild and variable graces of glowing youth my Mary added the perfect features of her father exquisitely feminized by a complexion transparently fair and a bloom alike delicate and vivid her hair of the golden brown I have described as peculiar to his fell below her waist in a profusion of artless ringlets heightening her beauty even to luxurianceIf she had borrowed any thing from me it was the collected modesty of her mien and from my sister she had stolen that penetrating fascinating smile those two alone of all I ever saw were gifted withalas it was now wholly her ownAlthough lightness and elasticity characterized her figure every limb was rounded even to polishing and never did I contemplate the soft turn of her white arms when raised to touch the lute without thinking those  more perfect than even her faceHer voice was no less sweet in speaking than singing with this differencein the first she softened the soul to pleasure in the last elevated it to raptureHer understanding was strong and penetrating yet elevated and refinedHer sensibility the first formed of all her feelings was Father deep than ardent Maternal experience had moderated the enthusiasm incident to youth nor was it obvious in any instance but the love of knowledge Incessant unremitting in her studies books were her only extravagance and musick her only relaxation To compensate for the worldly pleasures I judged it prudence to deprive her of I was lavish in indulgences to which her taste naturally led I kept musicians on purpose to accompany her and found in the years filled up by herself and her employments that sweet though saddened pleasure parents only know and which perhaps more than makes us amends for all the more lively ones it recalls to  our memory In effect the more lovely she grew the more necessary I found it to hide her and offering her daily up to God I left her wholly to his disposal determined neither my pride vanity or ambition should interfere with the happiness I supplicated for her  On perusing this description I perceive at once the impossibility of your crediting it yet far from accusing myself of partiality I could call on all who ever beheld my daughter to attest my candorHow readily would Lady Arundell have done soentendered to her by a love only inferior to my own that faithful friend found in declining life a new tye wound round her heart for which she daily thanked me  As nothing robs us of the confidence of youth like the appearance of mystery when time called reflection to being in her tender mind I slowly and by degrees confided to my daughter the painful events you have thus obliged me to commemorate This indulgence secured  to me her whole heart and I trembled only lest her deep sense of past misfortunes should affect her health for sensibility was the leading feature in her character Far from seeking to expound the future in her own favor the flattering prospects her distinguished birth and yet more distinguished endowments might well spread before her passed away like a shadow and she saw only her mother A thousand times has she bedewed my hand with a reverence the most endearing and the tears with which she often embalmed the memory of her father almost recompensed me for his loss From that period her expressive eyes were fixed ever on mine with such blended sadness and admiration as proved she thought me almost sainted by misfortune More studious henceforward of my pleasure more submissive to my will more solicitous for my repose it seemed as if in learning she was my only remaining tye on earth she conceived the various affections and duties of all I had  lost devolved to and centered in herself But sympathy was the genuine impulse of her nature for with equal care she watched over her unhappy aunt Whenever that dear creature's incurable malady assumed the appearance of melancholy she was extravagantly fond of musickAt those intervals my lovely Mary would lean over her lute with the meek benignity of a descending angel and extract from it such solemn sounds as breathed at once of peace and sorrow insensibly soothing the perturbed spirit and melting only those yet undisturbed That subtle essence of our natures sensibility which madness can only unfix not annihilate often paused unconsciously upon the pleasure and softly sunk into repose  A child thus eminently amiable at once concentered my affectionscommanded my esteempossessed my whole confidence actuated in short my very beingAh how noble how affecting is the friendship grounded on the maternal and  filial tye when unconscious of any weakness in her own heart the mother dares present it as a pure and unflattering mirror to her child and with that selfapplause which even Heaven approves contemplates the upright the innocent soul it reflectsSacred and indelible becomes that precept which is expressed but by exampleHappy are those enabled to form such an attachment as inexperience strengthens on one hand and knowledge on the otherNeither the gusts of youthful passion nor the nipping frosts of age can destroy a plant rooted thus by mutual virtueit only gains vigor from time and by the peculiar indulgence of the Almighty our sublimest merit ripens into our most perfect pleasure  Satisfied I had already acquired such an influence in my daughter's mind as should enable me to regulate her principles I left it to time and circumstances to call them into actionThe great business of my life now seemed over  and delivering my heart up to the flattering presages of maternal love a thousand visions of almost forgotten grandeur and happiness floated before my eyes and sometimes halfdeluded them  The fluctuating complaints of Lady Arundell at length settled into a consumptionIt was an hereditary disorder of the Sydneys nor perhaps could all the solicitude of myself and my sweet Mary have availed toward her restoration even if a cruel shock in which we were all equal sufferers had not precipitated her fate  Among the unconscious caprices which by turns actuated my unfortunate sister was a passion for sitting in the open airNeither times or seasons had any influence over her and she would insist on it alike in the snow of December and the scorching sun of JulyTo this selfwill I had no doubt greatly contributed From the moment of my return to England I had vehemently opposed the severe controul to which she had heretofore  been subject and habituated her attendants to yield to her in every instance which did not absolutely endanger her safety fully determined not to render an existence wholly wretched no human being could now make happy But as uninformed minds never know a medium the people appointed to watch her gradually suffered her to become sensible of her power which soon grew into an unbounded indulgence It was now the depth of winter and she had sat in the keen air for hours watching the snow which fell in abundanceThe most violent shiverings ensued followed by a fever which settled at last on the nerves and brought her to the very verge of the graveNevertheless it appeared to have salutary effectsher spirits were sunk indeed to extreme lowness but they became more equal and traces of reason were often discernable in her actions If she did not remember she yet strove to know me and sometimes studied my features in a manner the most  touchingI considered this as the very crisis of her fateher only chance on this side Heaven and scarce dared leave her for a single moment I entrusted the care of Lady Arundell whose situation though more dangerous was not so melancholy to my daughter fearful lest her youthful spirits should be injured by constantly beholding an object so affecting But I had forgot that my own shattered constitution was not equal to the fatigue and anxiety of watching over my sister I fell one evening into a succession of fainting fits the servants conveyed me to bed and the fear of alarming Lady Arundell hindered them from informing my daughter of my situation My faintings at length gave place to a drowsiness so intense I might call it a stuporI remained thus for some hours when I started with an indistinct idea of a heavy fall and a deep groan Terror roused and collected in a moment every dormant facultyI rushed through the chamber which divided mine from my sister's but I blamed myself for impetuosity  when I perceived all was profoundly silent in hers The two nurses were in a deep sleep and the expiring watchlights heavily winked and revived before the cold dawn of the morning I gently opened the curtains of her bedAh gracious Heaven what did I feel when I beheld it emptyThe agonized shriek I gave rouzed both her careless attendants who impressed with but one idea flew towards a door I now first perceived to be open it led to a gallery ornamented with such portraits of our family as had survived the wreck of their fortunes among them was incautiously placed that already fatally commemorated of the Earl of Essex at the storming of Cadiz an unfortunate legacy bequeathed to Ellinor by Lady PembrokeMy soul took in at a thought all the fearful consequencesI tottered into the galleryalas only to behold my worst apprehension verifiedThe fair spectre which once was Ellinor lay prostrate before the pictureone hand had convulsively gathered her disordered  garments over her thin chest the other was still expressively extended towards the inanimate image of him so belovedImpatiently I laid my hand upon her heartit answered not the trembling enquirerits wandering essence was exhaled and she had ceased forever to suffer Thy parting prayer oh Essex was surely prophetic for her soul in recovering memory had burst its mortal bound and soared to Heaven  Scarce were the dear remains quietly interred ere those of the amiable Lady Arundell followed them I bore these losses with devout resignationThe tears which fall when Heaven recalls the unfortunate still the wild passions of the sad survivor and deeply wound only the soul yet new to suffering It was with a quickened apprehension I perceived the effect of these first afflictions on the tender spirits of my daughter not that I sought totally to stifle the lively impressions of natural affectionthe tears of youth like the genial showers of  May serve only to save the planter's toil and simply ripen the rich fruits of the mind but when either fall too often they impoverish the soil and wash away the buds yet blowing  My own soul afforded no variety of chearful images with which I could hope to invigorate the gentle spirits of my Mary unwilling to form new connections I rather thought it prudent to change my abode and by a variety of scenes insensibly amuse her and my steward was sent accordingly to seek another mansion I called back the moment when the gloomy aisles of a ruined convent by possessing the simple advantage of novelty diverted my mind even at the sorrowful crisis which robbed me of a foster mother Alas in yet untried youth the prospect that is unknown ever adds to its own charms those of imagination while in maturer life the heart lingers on all which once delighted it hopeless of finding in the future a pleasure fancy can ever compare with those it reviews  in the past To my daughter however the whole world was yet new and in fixing on a scene habitual to my feelings I could not fail to delight hers I hired a mansion near the Thames side in Richmond to which we removed early in the spring  Perhaps in this choice I was influenced almost without knowing it by a latent motive distinct as I had lived from the world since my return to England the fame of the Prince of Wales had yet reached meThis accomplished youth had at once rose above the weaknesses of his father and the prejudices of his rank devoting his heart to the virtues his mind to the sciences and his person to those manly and becoming exercises which invigorating every human power prepared him alike for the enjoyment of peace or the pursuit of war Delighted to understand a Stuart was rising to redeem the glory of his declining race I passionately longed to see know and be valued by the royal  Henry The King unworthy a son so distinguished took no pleasure in his company but even in tender youth resigned him to a court of his own from the adulation of which merit superior to praise alone could have guarded him Henry had like myself a partiality for the beautiful village of Richmond he always passed part of the summer in a palace near the Thames and I took pleasure in thinking a partition of wood alone separated his gardens from mine With a judgment unequalled at his years the Prince knew how to be affable without abating aught of his dignity and while in the circle of his own court he preserved the authority of a Sovereign to the unfortunate who addressed him he had the benignity of a brother such was his character in Richmond where the people almost adored him and took pleasure in amplifying on the superior qualities he so eminently possessed The sweet hopes his merit sometimes infused  into my bosom came accompanied with an equal number of fears yet could not my heart forbear to cherish them  The revolving season tinged this sweet retreat with every variety of verdure the waves of the Thames were more translucent than ever all nature awakened once more to perfection when the Prince of Wales took up his abode in the adjacent palaceThis news heightened the soft red of my daughter's cheek and even faintly colored my wan oneNot daring to express to her the eager desire I felt to see the Prince and not accustomed to venture out without her day after day elapsed in anxious expectation My gentle Mary with a delicacy from which I drew the most happy presages now always chose to go abroad either so early or so late that it was almost impossible we should ever meet the Prince and the veil she usually wore was closed with so much care as to ensure her the happiness of being overlooked even if fortune threw him in our way  Nevertheless I took notice the arrival of the royal Henry strangely filled up the void in our livesWhat he would do or what he would not do constantly regulated our motions and employed my daughter's thoughts even more than my own His taste afforded us a variety of indulgencies of which he knew not we were partakersSometimes moonlight concerts or magnificent fireworks at others parties on the Thames where the Prince still took pleasure in beholding a variety of little vessels built and ornamented for the amusement of his early years and which were manned by childrenThey were often so near we fancied we heard the voice of Henry when both mother and daughter would give way to the same impulse and hastily retire The summer might have elapsed in this manner had not chance been more favorable to our wishes than we could resolve to be  We were returning home one morning in an illcontrived carriage newly invented  for airings the inconvenience of which I bore patiently from not being able to walk or ride on horseback for any length of time since my memorable feverThe servant who drove stopt as usual at the brow of the enchanting hill that we might enjoy for a few minutes its beauties when the sound of horns approaching near informed us the Prince of Wales was returning from hunting which at once startled the horses and ourselves My Mary actuated only by the impression of the moment made an eager sign to the man to drive on and the horses already frightened yielded impetuously to the slightest touch of the rein flying forward with the most dangerous rapidity The clumsiness of the carriage and the badness of the road threatened us every moment with being overturnedfor me there was no escape but could my daughter be prevailed on to leap out I was sensible she would be safe Far from obeying my intreaties or even commands she threw her arms around  me and protested it was for me alone she feared The carriage sunk into a deep rut at last and we were thrown out at a small distance with a violence that almost deprived me of my sensesmy darling Mary had wholly lost hers I perceived the train of Henry approaching but the favorite wish of seeing him was forgotten in that of recovering herI was presently environed by the hunters without regarding them till their extreme sollicitude obliged me to raise my eyes from the lifeless face of my daughter in acknowledgment I perceived with a surprize even that moment could not conquer that on either hand stood a young man adorned with the order of the garter and so distinguishingly handsome that I knew not which was the Prince of Wales but turned from the one to the other with an air of wildness and stuporMy looks however made little impression on the strangers their whole attention being fixed on the inanimate form of my daughter  In truth fortune had contrived to shew her to the utmost advantage I had thrown up her veil to give her air and bared her beautiful hands and arms polished and white as Parian marble the wild rings of her auburn hair played on her youthful face as the yellow leaves of Autumn curl over a later peach whilst every feature formed with a truth which might bear the nicest examination perhaps only appeared more exquisitely regular from the absence of expression and even her figure and attitude leaning on her mother's knees presented a perfect model for a sculptor The assiduities of the strangers together with my own at length recalled her scattered sensesShe opened those eyes so dear to me and fixing them on the two strangers a rosy suffusion alone proved she saw them with such quickness did she turn toward her mother when beholding me to appearance unhurt she listed her soul to Heaven in a look of gratitude and throwing her arms round  my neck relieved her overcharged heart by weeping on my bosom "An angel in soul as well as form exclaimed one of the strangers assure me madam continued he that this terror is the only ill consequence of my sudden approach or I know not how I shall forgive it to myself" This address ascertaining the Prince of Wales he became the sole object of my attentionAh where shall I find words to endear to you Madam the royal youth my heart at once opened to adopt Henry was yet but in the dawn of manhood nevertheless his height was majestic and his figure finished The beauty of his features was their least charmvirtue herself seemed to sublime every happy lineament and spare beholders the trouble of developing his character by conveying it in a glance His manly voice united the firmness of his own sex with the sensibility of ours A confusion of sad remembrances were at once presented with him to my mind and the admiration he excited  was strangely blended with regretI forgot that he had addressed me and continued to contemplate him in silence ever and anon turning my streaming eyes wildly from him to Heaven even then my dilating heart bids me add scarce changing the object The amiable Henry in whose nature sympathy was the prevailing sentiment touched with a conduct so mysterious almost forgot my daughter in turn so wholly was he engrossed by meInformed of my unfortunate lameness by my attempting to rise he immediately concluded it to be the consequence of the recent accident and scarce was satisfied by my assurances of the contrary Oh as my eyes surveyed the superior soul living irradiated in the bright orbs of his how did they stream at remembering that had his father been born to half his virtues I might now have been cherished by affectiondignified by rankunwidowedunbrokena stranger yet to sorrowMy mother tooMost unhappy of parents as well as sovereigns I had a  tear for thee at this interesting moment  The respect due to strangers induced the Prince to conceal the curiosity my conduct could not fail to excite but having informed himself from the attendants of my title he addressed me by it and insisted on conducting me home I now understood the nobleman who had divided my first looks with the Prince to be the Viscount Rochester that contemptible favorite of the King celebrated only for his beautyThe visible coldness of my air checked a forward insolence I observed in him and obliged him to quit us on our arriving at home  With what secret transport did my soul welcome a Stuart worthy that name glorious for so many agesThe Prince seemed delighted with his new acquaintancesThe soft reserve of my daughter's airthe deepening roses of her cheek and the low accent of her harmonious voice when politeness obliged her to answer the Prince whose animated eyes reduced hers often to seek the  ground presented to my elated heart every symptom of that passion which alone endears the sufferings it occasions A flow of happy spirits new to my daughter almost forgotten by myself gave chearfulness to the hour which Henry saw elapse with regret  On this chance introduction was grounded an acquaintance a few days ripened into intimacyLed to distinguish the Prince alike by his own merit and the ties of blood which secretly allied me to him it was with the tenderest satisfaction I beheld him cherish the inclination he had already conceived for my daughter yet the dignity of his mind forbidding him to form an engagement he knew not how to fulfill it was through me alone he addressed himself to her Convinced it was in my power to prove her entitled even to such a lover I suffered fate to take its course attending only to prudences  Conscious that Henry had hitherto moved in a very confined circle I was aware to extend it must draw much observation  on those he favored To guard therefore against the malice of surmise I fixed on the hour of the Prince's visit for my daughter to ride out and always received him alone His attendants who saw her regularly depart were at a loss to imagine what could attach their royal master to the infirm widow of Lord Leicester The charm was in truth simply affectionThe amiable Henry had early been accustomed to every kind of homage but that of the heart and had too much sensibility not to feel the want he knew not how to supply Deeply susceptible of the true regard I had conceived for him impressed at once by my mind my manners and my mien with the idea of mystery and the desire of obtaining my confidence it was only by his own candor he sought to gain upon mine Slowly and by degrees he deigned to repose with me those regrets and anxieties from which the utmost indulgence of nature and fortune cannot exempt a single individual He often lamented the dangerous distinction of being the firstborn  born of his father's children since it cost him every otherSeparated almost in infancy from his parentssurrounded with mercenary sycophants who sought to make their court to the reigning King by a partial representation or misconstruction of his actions he had shot up unloved uncherished and seen those tender affections he was born to share gradually center in that son from whom his parents had nothing to fearNor were wanting insidious flatterers equally ready to undermine his filial duty by pointing out the weaknesses of his father even where they were most likely to wound him He had punished himself he added for yielding to these impressions by an absolute obedience to his authority but it was with grief he remembered that was now the only tye between themNor would I wonder he continued it should be so if I considered that born as he was to imperial power with an ardent passion for glory he had hitherto been shut up in the narrow sphere of his own court languishing away the  flower of his youth without a choice a friend or a pursuitTill the infamous Carr should deign to decide what foreign Prince's bribe he would condescend to accept and to what bigoted Papist he should sacrifice the son of his master  While the admired Prince of Wales the idol of the People the heir of Empire the endued of Heaven thus confided to me the simple and rational griefs which clouded a fortune so brilliant could I fail to meditate on the equality of providenceWhich graciously allots even to the lowest situation some portion of happiness and depresses the highest with the sad sense of misfortune  It is the fatal peculiarity of youth to throw the strongest light on every secret grief and waste away under an oppression imagination often doubles To cure this propensity is therefore the province of experience I sought to imbue the Prince's mind with the only principle mine had derived from all my sufferingsThat the noblest use we can make of  understanding is to convert it into happiness and every talent which does not conduce to that great end ought rather to be considered as a burthen than a blessing to the possessorThat the mind like the eye ever magnifies the object of fear or aversion which often on a strict examination excites no other sentiment than contemptInfine that he was not at liberty to shew any other sense of his father's errors than by presenting a faultless example in his own life and that if he would have it without blemish he must divert his taste from channels where it would meet with opposition and turn it into those through which it might flow freelyThat the cultivation of the sciences would at once fill up that void in his life ever so painful at his years and attach to his welfare all who loved them a body whose influence was never known unless opposition called forth the powers of eloquence  The Prince had too much judgment not to see the utility of this council and too much generosity not to value its candour nevertheless it was a language yet new to his earsIngenuity had been exhausted to teach him to govern others but to subdue himself was a lesson none had ventured to inculcate How did I lament a soul so ductile had in childhood been injudiciously delivered up to its own guidance and suffered every day to imbibe some new prejudice destined perhaps to mark the character through life and which an upright and skilful monitor might so easily have eradicated  The Prince could not be insensible to the maternal caution which induced me to send my daughter abroad whenever he honored me with a visit yet the observation did not for some time appear to influence his conductSatisfied with merely beholding her as he entered or departed the desire of opening his heart to me seemed to supercede every other impression  Nevertheless long reveries would follow the most accidental meeting and long pauses intervene in the most interesting conversation rendering it sufficiently obvious that his mind labored with some project hitherto suppressed either by pride or prudence  Perhaps I should ever have wanted courage to open my lips on so delicate an occasion had not my daughter complained to me that she was now become the universal object of attention and that the suite who attended her were often rudely surrounded and sometimes interrogated by such of the Prince's court as had not benefited by his exampleBy going abroad unexpectedly with her I found she was not offended without reason and sensible of my imprudence in thus risquing her safety I came to the resolution rather to abridge myself of the pleasure of the Prince's society than purchase it by endangering my daughterI desired her to retire for awhile when Henry should visit  me next and ere he could account for the singularity of finding her at home entered into the delicate explanation With an acknowledged attachment to him that I bore my child alone could have overruled I submitted it to himself whether I could too cautiously guard against a censure or insult she had no natural protector to resentThe generous Henry paused for a few moments with irresolution when suddenly collecting courage he broke silence"Will Lady Leicester pardon said he those obtrusive visits she has submitted to with so much complacency Will she deign to become the confidant of the only incident in my life I have hid from herwill she listen with indulgence"He paused a moment but ere I could resolve how to answer pursued the discourse"Accustomed even from childhood to the ensnaring glances of the light and the lovelyled to imagine myself older than my years by the continual proposals for marrying me that  have constantly succeeded each other it is not wonderful that a heart naturally susceptible should mature before its time Among the many beautiful girls who have already sought to attract me I soon distinguished one by whom my peace my honour my innocence became endangered perhaps they had been lost had I not found her selfish and ambitious I need hardly inform you that this seducing fair one is the Countess of EssexVain of her influence over me she took pleasure in publishing it and taught me early to blush for my choice but I could not resolve to do so continually I formed the bold resolution of contending with my own heart and retired hither to recover it or die Lady Essex enraged and humbled at this conduct confirmed me in it by attaching herself to Viscount Rochester thus rendering it sufficiently obvious she had never loved meBesotted with her beauty that weak favourite is governed by her caprices and him I was born to obey yields to those of Rochester Although  I do not immediately perceive how Lady Essex means to effect her revenge I am convinced it is only maturing and daily expect a blow from which I know not how to guard myself Under these circumstances how can I venture to involve your fate with mine How can I ask you to permit me to offer to your lovely daughter the heart which ever hovers near her Speak Madammy happiness is in your handsdare you risque your own to promote it" While I listened to this sensible this frank declaration of the Prince's error and his attachment my fond heart found its first with accomplished and adopted at once the royal youth solemnly vowing to share without repining every evil that might follow an alliance so dear nor did I fail secretly to exult in my Mary's hereditary right even to this distinction  To cement the confidence between us and convince the Prince his present choice was judicious I resolved to confide to him the secret so long so painfully preserved  and related my whole history As I retraced its affecting incidents I knew them to be so only by his eager his generous sympathy so wholly was my own soul engrossed by the happy prospect he had opened before it  The Prince of Wales acknowledged with joy the relationship I claimed to confirm all I had advanced I presented to him the longsaved testimonials which he perused with silent reverence then fixing his eyes still impressed with that elevated sentiment on mine he gave utterance to the dictates of his heart "Who could suppose exclaimed he a fortitude so unexampled could possibly be combined with a frame delicate even to fragilityMay the misfortunes you have indelibly impressed on my memory my more than mother be the last of your lifeMay that being who directed my soul to cherish the admiration and esteem inspired by your lovely daughter and matchless self suffer the youth before you to supply to your heart all it ought to have inheritedall it unhappily has  lost Dear will be the moment when to the form of your angel mother my authority shall add the name and that moment will hereafter oh most honoured of women infallibly be mine"  While I listened to predictions so flattering I almost believed them accomplished In thy unblown youth  h  oyal Henry was comprized every promise that could dilate or fill the heart mine centred at once in thee and my daughter finding in the mere hope of so glorious a union a total suspension from suffering and sorrow  I had now no reserves with the Prince and leading in my blushing Mary presented her to her royal Cousin who gracefully offered up his unblemished soul on the hand he bowed over So pure a transport took possession of mine as obliterated every other impression I snatched the united hands so dear so beloved and pressing them to my bosom sickened with very extasy and withdrew to recover myselfWandering alone by  the side of the Thames I raised my full eyes to heaven and called the happy spirits of my mother sister and Lord Leicester to sympathize with me in an event which promised to end the persecutions of my family by thus blessedly uniting the last sprung branches of it A serenity of the sublimest nature succeeded the sweet trouble of my spirits and enabled me to rejoin the youthful lovers with the dignity due to my own character  The situation in which we stood endeared us still more to the Prince by perpetually reminding him how intimately our welfare was connected with his own Every hour seemed to unite us more and more to each other Henry spoke to me with the freedom of a son conjuring me not to take any step that might create the least suspicion of my birth or the secret tye formed between us till he had well weighed every consequence that might ensue and to elude the watchful spies with whom we were alike surrounded he proposed passing in the evening through his garden to ours if I would deign for  awhile to allow him thus to reach the saloon Our situation was too delicate not to require the strictest caution yet as I could discover no mode of receiving the Prince which was not equally questionable and more dangerous I consented to that he proposed as well as that he should render one of his gentlemen Sir David Murray a confidante of this intimacy though not of its nature or extent  An incident so important engrossing my every thought my heart returned once more eagerly into the world It had now an interest in fully understanding the real characters of the King the Queen Viscount Rochester and every individual likely or intitled to interfere at this interesting crisisI examined considered weighed every thing I soon discovered the whole Royal Family were at variance That the imperious Queen unable to wrest her husband from his favourites or her son from his duties scorned the first and neglected the latter confining herself wholly to a  court formed of her own creatures who assisted her to spoil her younger son whom she had almost estranged from his brother Her beautiful daughter who united in her own person the graces of Mary with the spirit of Elizabeth alone allured to the court of the Queen the few persons of merit it afforded Henry was often lavish in the praises of his sister and as she was the only relation he ever voluntarily spoke of I naturally concluded she was the only one entitled by superior qualities to that distinction King James who had mounted the throne under happier auspices than almost any preceding sovereign of England had already lived long enough to lose the affections of his people By turns a pedant and a buffoon his solemnity was even more disgusting than his levity Governed by a predilection of the most absurd and singular nature to a beautiful favourite he always delivered up the reins of empire readily submitting to a shameful subjection in all important points provided he might enjoy a ridiculous supermacy  in his hours of indulgence and retirement From such a weak and inconsistent King and his profligate Ministers the wise the scientific and the good had gradually retreated and in neglect and silence contemplated from far the growth of that exemplary Prince who promised to retrieve the fame of his ancestors and the glory of the kingdom he was born to reign over A youth of eighteen capable of uniting the unblemished virtues of that age with the discernment of a maturer one was a phaenomenon and of course either adored or detestedWhile the body of the kingdom regarded him only with the first sentiment the worthless favorites of his father were actuated solely by the latter  To marry and escape the plans of Rochester was the interest of Henry and to marry without his father's knowledge his unwilling choiceYet highly sensible of the slavery imposed by his rank he had resisted every temptation from beauties of an inferior onebut when apprized of my story he saw or fancied he  saw in my daughter a wife alloted him by heavenone to whom no just objection could possibly be made one born to give happiness to his heart and honor to his name Nor could he doubt even if his father shut his eyes against the truth but that he should be able to convince the people of my birth when the publication of the marriage should give my story the whole weight of his credence  Success in his judgment depended solely on the concealment of the purposed union till it could be accomplished for if the intention transpired ere the event he was satisfied the most desperate efforts would be made to wrest us from him Yet as at this very period a publick treaty was negociating with a foreign Prince he could not form a tye of such importance without giving his father just cause of offence the nation at large a contempt for his character and the distant Sovereign thus insulted a mortal disgust We therefore agreed to wait till this Ministerial project like many others should disappoint itself and seize that moment to  celebrate and publish a marriage which was to end all our fears and complete all our hopes  During this interval I observed with pain that the extreme timidity of my daughter's character prevailed over the enthusiasm incident to her years and damped with vague apprehensions those moments love and hope might have made so happy I saw this little feminine weakness with extreme uneasiness The Prince of Wales was distinguished by a manly firmness which ever wisely weighed the approaching trial then calmly dared it For a soul so noble I desired to find a faultless bride and looking fearfully into the future I sometimes thought my Mary's timid heart would one day throb without cause against that of a sovereign oppressed with innumerable cares he perhaps sought to lose the remembrance of in her society Nevertheless I did not perceive my tender admonitions on this subject had any other consequence than that of inducing my daughter to bury in her bosom those sentiments and emotions  I had so many years delighted to participate  It was now autumnThe time of the King's periodical progressesThe Prince could not avoid following his father but he lingered in his duty and having staid a day too long with us hastened to overtake the King whom he was to feast at Woodstock He wrote to me from thence complaining of fatigue and lassitude but with his usual attention informed me he was in treaty for Kenilworth Castle where he flattered himself I should again see golden days like those I still remembered with so much pleasure  Alas those he had irradiated were quickly hastening to a period At the first visit he paid me on his return my soul was struck with a very apparent alteration in his person which was grown thin and wan beyond conception considering the shortness of the time Not all the joy he expressed a our meeting could satisfy me he was either well or happy but observing he evaded my question and fearful of alarming  him without reason I strove to suppress that maternal anxiety all his assurances of health and chearfulness could not dispel I perceived my daughter was impressed with the same idea for though she spoke not it was visible to me she wept greatly when alone  The evenings were now too short and damp for me to allow the evening visits of the Prince and I rather chose to risque every danger by receiving him openly than subject him to any by an illjudged cautionAlas these cares were vainThe rapid decay of the Royal Henry's health became visible even to indifferent spectators An affecting languor was the only expression of those fine eyes once so full of fire and the youthful cheeks every following day should have tinged with a deeper bloom grew more and more wan and hollowHe could no longer conceal his illness Alas it pierced me to the soul I was miserable at remembering a charge so precious as his welfare should be committed to servants of whatever denomination  No motherno sisterduties indispensable in every other rank of life were it seems incompatible with royalty Oh Henrydear amiable youth even yet am I tempted to accuse myself for not having better deserved the tender appellation thy filial reverence so often bestowed on me by daring every thing for thy sake Slaves to imperious custom our actions are too often regulated by that idle multitude whose most lavish applauses would but ill console us for one single reproach from that unerring monitor our own conscience  Either not convinced this secret malady was undermining his constitution or indifferent to the event the Prince still continued in the pursuit of his usual athletic exercises and habits till his strength was wholly unequal to them I once more persuaded him to call in medical assistance and he promised to attend to himself as soon as his sister and the elector should departObliged to appear at the celebration of their marriage in London he came to pay us a parting visit  Impressed perhaps with the idea it would be the last he threw himself into my arms and shed there the first tears I had ever seen fall from his eyesMine readily overfloweda grief too deep for utterance pressed upon my soul and Henry recovered ere I could His heart missed my daughter who was gone abroadHe sighed sunk into a little reverie and breaking it with a faint smile said "he ought rather to congratulate himself on her absence" He sighed again and after another pause resumed his discourse in a low and broken voice "Mourn not thus my mother for I will still give you a title you may justly claim from her who bore me since who ever loved me as you have done I have youth in my favor and this oppressive malady may not be mortal for your sake alone do I wish it to be otherwise believe meAlready weary disgusted with this world I could retreat from it almost without a pang did I not know my loss would be to you an irremediable calamity Yet who shall judge of the dispensations  of the AlmightyI might fulfil all your wishes without seeing you happyI might obtain all my own without ceasing to be wretched Recall this often to your memory whatever follows our parting and remember your name will be ever on these lips while they have power to utter a soundFor the adored of my soulbut she is surely become a part of it and if not permitted to possess her in this world I will expect her in a better"Perceiving his dim eye was fixed on a picture of my daughter which hung at my bosom I presented it to him"And do you too beloved Henry returned I in a broken voice remember the mother who gives you this would have comprized in the original every grace every virtue to be found through human nature and having done so would still have thought her honored in your choiceAh royal youth resign not a heart so noble to vapourish depressionYour life your happiness are not your own merelya nation are born to pray for the former to crown you with  the latterFor myselfupon the sweet hope of matching my daughter with you of sharing the soft transports of mutual virtue and affection I have learnt to live but surely I could never survive its extinction"My full soul allowed not of another syllable The Prince fixed his suffused eyes on mine with a mysterious melancholy almost amounting to despair and touching with his lips those hands his trembling ones still grasped rushed precipitately into the court yard The sound of his voice drew me towards the windowthe graceful youth made me a last obeisance and galloped away while my partial eye pursued him till beyond its reach and even then my ear seemed to distinguish the feet of his horse  With his usual kind consideration Henry wrote to me the next day that he found himself better and in the pleasure of seeing his sister happy felt reconciled to the impolitick match made for herHe even assisted at the various festivals with which the nuptials of the royal Eli  abeth were honored but scarce were  they over when his health and spirits failed at once and the faculty were called in to his aid A malady which had been so long engrafting itself on his constitution left but little hope of his lifeI had ceased to entertain any yet far from supporting the idea of losing him with fortitude my soul mourned as if it then had first known sorrow Not daring to give free vent to my apprehensions in the presence of my daughter I strove with cold and watery smiles to flatter those hopes in her heart my own had long rejected and saw with vain regret the deep excesses of a sensibility I had laboured to excite and strengthen  What days what nights of sadness and suspense were ours while the unfortunate Henry was languishing away every vital power ere yet they had reached maturityFrequently delirious our names escaped unconsciously from those lips which at his lucid intervals uttered only sighs and groans Murray his beloved attendant gave us constant information of the progress of his fever nor did the  amiable Henry fail at intervals to charge him with tender remembrances Sir David at length acquainted me that the impassioned delirium of the Prince pointing ever towards us the King had been apprized of itthat he had minutely questioned his son's most favored attendants and among them himself on the origin progress and strength of an attachment thus suddenly and strangely brought to light deeply ruminating on all he heard "I could not feel acquitted to myself madam concluded the faithful Murray were I to conceal this nor dare I add a surmise on so delicate an occasion"  Ah of what importance to us are all the late enquiries the vague conjectures of James cried I folding my daughter to my bosom if heaven deprives us of his inestimable son neither his love or his hatred can greatly affect usBeloved Marydear inheritor of misfortunewidowed ere yet thou art a wife a long obscurity a solitary youth is all thy portiona sorrow which can never end thy  Mother'sBut why should I hesitate to avow myself Wherefore should I not publish claims which even tyranny can not cancel but perhaps it will not dispute The timid abject spirit of James knows not how to contend with one firm in virtueimmutable in truthAh had I done so long since I might at this moment dear Henry have hovered near thy couch and softened the anguish no mortal can preventPerhaps the King already surmises the factlet him demand it  Sir David Murray's next letter breathed the very spirit of despair"Prepare yourself madam said he for the worst perhaps ere this reaches you England will have lost its dearest hope the royal Henry's friends their only one The most desperate efforts of art have failed and exhausted reason often now revisits with a languid ray the noble heart she is so soon to quit forever The Prince has just ordered me to commit to the flames every letter and paper in which  your name is mentioneda sure proof that he has given himself upAlas he knows not how often names so dear have escaped him he has called for you madam and your angelic daughter almost the whole night but frequently recollecting himself has waved his feeble hand and sighed out nonono"  Three hours after another express arrived"Pardon madam the haste and incoherency of scrawls penned at so trying a momentAlas the most sanguine of us has now ceased to hopeOur royal master's speech entirely fails himhis last effort was hastily and repeatedly to call meI flew to his bedside but though my every sense seemed to resolve into ear I found it impossible to understand himeither I widely erred or he named France perhaps I commit a second error in supposing he referred to you madam but I voluntarily risque every thing to fulfil the parting wish of a master so adored The King the physicians all have taken a long leave of  the almost beatified Prince and there is nothing left for those who love him best to wish but that his pure spirit may pass away in peace"  The agony and stupor this affecting billet occasioned were hardly abated when another arrived"It is all over madam concluded the worthy Murray raise your streaming eyes to heaven it is there alone you can now look for the incomparable Prince of WalesFatigue and anguish disable me from saying more"  It was not till the awful moment which restored the unsullied soul of Henry to its omniscient Creator that I had dared to breathe a wish of which he was not the object or allowed my thoughts to pass beyond himselfThat exquisite sensibility which lives through all dear to us had made me severely suffer with him and consequently pray for that release which alone seemed likely to give him ease nor did I recollect till he was gone forever the void his loss would leave in  my hopesThe tremendous calm by which death is ever followed now took its turnBereft of a support on which I had long unconsciously rested I sunk into a desolation which made me almost wish to follow the lamented PrinceIt is at these intervals madam we become most truly sensible of all the imperfections of our natureHow often had I flattered my own erring heart with the vain belief it had acquired strength purity and virtue from its various trials alas what but pride vanity and ambition still throbbed unalterably there time had only altered the object not the passion and centred them all in my daughter  We shut ourselves entirely up and deeply joined in the general mourning The sad pleasure of knowing him we bewailed universally lamented was yet ours I perused I appropriated with a mother's fondness the lavish eulogies all sects all parties all poets graced the memory of the Prince withit was the only  mitigation my grief could knowA considerable time had elapsed without our hearing any thing from Murray in confirmation of his conjecture concerning Henry's last wish and the imperfect accents which lingered on his dying lipsBut though I could not resolve to become a guiltless fugitive even in compliance with Prince Henry's will I had had no other motive for remaining in England than to shew I was not driven out of it I now determined to quit a country which had been the grave of a hope so dear and found my daughter entirely of my mind In gratitude for the unwearied attention of Sir David Murray I informed him "of my intention to retire into Flanders not doubting but that the Hollanders would afford an honorable asylum to the widow and orphan of Lord LeicesterI besought him to accept a ring of considerable value in token of my deep sense of the generous attachment he had shewn alike to myself and that incomparable Prince whose loss was ever present to my mind and requested  as a last proof of his regard the restoration of that picture of my daughter I had given the royal Henry at our memorable parting"  The answer of Murray strangely startled and alarmed me"Your intention of quitting England madam said he relieves my mind from extreme anxietytime and circumstances have united to convince me I did not misunderstand the last imperfect accents of my muchloved masterLose not a moment in hastening to the asylum you have fixed onThe picture madam is I fear irretrievably goneI cannot by either bribes or intreaties procure any tidings of it  power  alas I now have notIf ever it comes to my hands rely on its being restored by him who will ever devoutly pray for your happiness"  This inexplicable letter roused every dormant facultyWherefore should my retiring abroad relieve the mind of a person unconnected with me  from extreme anxiety  Why should he urge thus my departure As it was rather  pride than prudence which induced me to seek a country where I might fearlessly assert my every right that project was now rejected from the very motive which first dictated itA mystery my nature ever disdained Resolved to comprehend all the motives on which Murray wished me to act I ordered every thing to be replaced and sat down once more quietly at home resolved to brave the storm if indeed there was any gathering rather than ascertain my safety by a disgraceful flight I once more wrote to Sir David acquainting him with my present conduct and its reasons insisting on being fully informed of those which actuated him to offer me advice so singular and mysteriousHow insinitely was my impatience curiosity and disdain heightened by his answer"I hear with admiration madam a determination which from a perfect knowledge of your character I ought perhaps to have foreseen nevertheless my sentiments are not altered nor less urged durst I divulge the  reasons on which they are grounded but decorum and delicacy give way to your commands and the occasion Nevertheless I find it impossible to commit them to paperDare you give me admission at midnightI shall be near your gate upon the chance but be wary in the choice of my conductor as perhaps my life nay even your own depends upon its being supposed you never had any private correspondence or communication with me"  How did my nature take fire at this incomprehensible letterMe to stoop to secresyto be exposed to shameThe unknown danger with which he represented me to be environed appeared wholly indifferent so exquisitely sensible was my soul of the imputation of dishonorAt times I resolved to shut out Murray and leave the brooding mischief to disclose itself by its effects but love for my daughter controling the strong spirit of indignation inseparable from innocence I yielded to the sugges  tions of prudence and prepared to admit himInured to every other species of suffering I knew not how to blush before any human being  My perplexed and agitated mind passed through the infinitude of possibilities without fixing upon oneAt times I imagined all the caution of the royal Henry had been insufficient and that the King by means of some lost or secreted letter had been fully apprized of his son's attachment to us and the hopes that were grounded upon it though even then I knew not why my life should be in the question still less could I imagine it endangered had his discoveries reached farther and traced out the long buried secret of my birth Involved in busy vague and alarming conjectures I hardly knew how to wait with any patience for the singular hour appointed to ascertain them  Sensible by the deep effect this took on my own mind that it must dreadfully shock my daughter's and still flattering  myself that this indistinct danger might be the creation of a desponding temper in Henry's favorite I resolved to wait the event of my midnight interview with him ere I confided more to my Mary than she must already have learnt from the change in my resolution respecting quitting EnglandBut as to see her was to explain all for how could I hope to veil emotions which burnt indignantly on my cheek I sent her word I was seized with a violent headach which I would endeavour to remedy by sleep and accompanied this message with a new book she had an eager desire to see and which I sincerely prayed might wholly occupy her attention at this interesting crisis  Oh world how false how erroneous are the feelings we imbibe from theeNature ordained shame the companion of guilt but overbearing custom has broke that tye and oftener bids her follow virtue Scarce could I resolve to know my imputed crime or look with complacency on the amiable man who  had ventured to suggest the unsoreseen dangersIt was the utmost effort of my reason to govern this unworthy impulse  The estimable Murray was sensible of an equal constraint and by the generous confusion with which he appeared before me restored my mind to its dignity and composure His mourning and the tears which followed the name of his lost royal master drew forth mine and at once blended our feelings Sir David with infinite delicacy and address entered into the Prince of Wales's singular illness as well as the various opinions his death had given rise tobut how did my soul freeze with horror to learn that there were many and among them some of his Physicians who believed him poisoned The killing grief such a suspicion must at a more tranquil moment have caused vanished however at once before the confused and rapid sensations his following discourse occasionedOh let me pause here a moment to adore the  indulgence of the Almighty which alone could have enabled my intellects to support so terrible a shock as the report that it was from my hands he received the deadly presentI looked at Murray awhile in speechless astonishmentGrief anger shame and horror divided and tore me in piecesI scarce heard his prayers and adjurations but pushing him from my feet shut up every indignant sense in my swelling heart and only hoped it might burst with the deep convulsion  A considerable time elapsed ere I was enough recovered to enquire into the origin of so black and malicious a calumny I then conjured him to inform me who was supposed to be its diabolical authorTo this he answered that when the equivocal decision of the faculty respecting the cause of the Prince's death first reached the Queen the vehemence of her grief as well as that of her temper made her instantly join with those who pronounced him poisonedThe doubt was no sooner published than  it became general every domestic of the Prince's houshold had been by turns the object of suspicion to his fellows and some of them had been weak enough to ascertain their safety by quitting the kingdom The rumour was by this means corroborated and strengthened but as nothing transpired that could authorize a judicial enquiry the King became satisfied the melancholy catastrophe of his youthful heir had been in the common course of nature when all at once by some incomprehensible means the vague suspicions of the multitude which were far from extinguished though wholly unfixed revived with added force and centred in me That it was now generally believed the Prince of Wales in the last visit he paid me had tasted some dry preserves a little refreshment of which he was extremely fond though fortunately the distraction of my mind at that period had prevented me from offering him any which most likely were poisoned as his last illness rapidly increased immediately afterIt was soon  published that I had been the constant object of his delirious reveries and every vague or mysterious expression which had escaped him at those intervals had been remembered traced and applied with diabolical ingenuity The singular precaution of his seeing his own papers burnt served only to persuade the prejudiced multitude that the unfortunate Prince was unwilling to stigmatize her who had destroyed him By such plausible and base suggestions the eyes of an inflamed and affected nation had been led towards the solitary dwelling where unconscious of danger I remained buried in a grief the most charitable imputed only to remorse There wanted but little to incite the people to anticipate the stroke of justice by tearing me to pieces when the King confirmed the general suspicion by a renewed and more minute enquiry into the nature of his son's visits to me their continuance and design and no person being able to satisfy his curiosity he dropt harsh and ambiguous expressions that several of his favorites had since  urged the propriety of bringing me to a public trial a measure which had the whole weight of the Queen's interest Alarmed and uncertain how to proceed Sir David had learned at this very juncture my intention of retiring into Holland and by supposing me preacquainted with the slanders of the publick had unwarily reduced himself to the painful necessity of repeating them He concluded with hinting the prudence of abiding by my former design of immediately quitting England as in instances where the prejudices of a nation infected even those individuals entrusted with the execution of its laws innocence itself was scarce a protection byased judges might easily mistake presumptions for proofs nor have candour enough to vindicate the honor which had thus been questioned  While Sir David yet spoke a new world displayed itself before meAh how unlike the paradise pictured by my guiltless mindThose countenances in  which I yesterday saw only the living image of their Creator now glared upon me like so many fiendsA horrible gulph seemed to open beneath my feet into which a thousand hands sought at once to precipitate me and my timid soul retreated in vain from the dangerTo live undistinguishedto die unknown were mortifications sufficiently grievous But the bare idea of being arraigned dragged as a prejudged criminal before a partial judge had something in it so tremendous as made every other evil appear ease My blood flowed impetuously through my frame and my bewildered judgment wanted strength to govern the torrentA malice so bold profound and diabolical could have only one author but where to look for that one I knew not nor could I recollect a human being I had injured or a villain I had provokedLike a wretch awakened by assassins in the darkness of midnight I knew not but the hand raised to ward the blow might bleed on the  presented dagger In this terrible conjuncture I had only virtue to befriend me though alas virtue herself halfwithers before the blighting breath of calumny While Sir David enforced the arguments he had already urged to induce me to quit the kingdom my soul by one of those violent exertions great occasions will sometimes produce recovered all her powersIndignation subsided at once into fortitude and anger into heroism"You have hitherto only seen me Sir David said I it is now alone you can know meshuddering with horror at the imputations you have explained I yet dare not retreat unless I can confute themno not even condemnation could induce me to fly and leave my honor behind meWhat shall I blight the opening virtues of my child by exposing her with myself to unmerited censure The pride the pleasure of unsullied virtue was all fortune permitted me to retain of the wealth and honors which once glittered before  my youthful eyesnor did I undervalue the most dear and facred of all possessions alas even that is now ravished from me and one way alone can it be retrievedDesperate as the effort seems it must be venturedyesI will see the King whatever it costs me surely the sainted spirit of the Royal Henry would appear to vindicate my innocence heavens that I should live to know it questioned were every other means to prove insuffcientI will trouble you no farther respected Murray unless you will deign to convey a letter to Lord Rochester requesting a private audience of the King"  An idea so singular had transferred the astonishment Murray had at first excited in me to his own mind that my intellects were touched then seemed to him very probable but perceiving that I was mistress both of my senses and temper he presumed not to contend with a spirit injury had nerved and struck with the silent dignity I assumed began to believe  I had indeed something important to disclose though quite at a loss respecting its nature I wrote to Lord Rochester now newly created Earl of Somerset according to the idea I had formed and Murray having engaged that the letter should be delivered early in the morning departed with the same caution with which he had entered leaving me aloneAlone did I sayAh gracious heaven never was I less soThe shades of all I had ever loved seemed to gather round me on this interesting occasion and volumes of obscure ideas rushed impetuously through my brainI had unexpectedly reached the very point of my sateThat important moment so often delayed so eternally dreaded was at length arrived and the long treasured secret on the verge of being publishedFor  myself  I had long ceased to fearThe fraternal acknowledgment of the King could now add nothing to my happiness since alas that incomparable youth was gone for whose sake  alone I desired it nor could his rejection greatly embitter a fate which had left me so little to hopeBut oh when I remembered his single breath might blight the tender blossom I had exhausted my very being to rearprecipitate my youthful Mary ere yet her virtues were known into an obscure and dishonorable grave where where could I gather strength to cope with this idea  I employed the remainder of the night in collecting and arranging such plausible reasons as should amuse my daughter's mind till the event was known thus sparing her all the pangs of suspense I gathered together likewise every paper and proof which could authenticate the rights I was compelled to avow and on perusing them once more found such reason to be assured not only of safety but distinction that a sacred calm succeeded to all the transports of grief and indignation with which I had of late been agitated  By a feigned invitation from a neighbouring lady who permitted me to render her house my convenience I sent my daughter abroad for the day and scarce had done so ere an express arrived to acquaint me the Earl of Somerset would wait on me in the afternoon  What were my proud emotions when the upstart Somerset littered my court with a princely retinueAlas the only Prince who had ever entered it with a noble consciousness despised such idle parade By oppressive offers of service the Earl made me sensible of his importance and sought by unbounded adulation to gain upon my heart and dive into its intentions but it was not by such a medium I sought distinction I politely avoided referring either to the slander or the purport of the requested audience and only thanked him for having obtained me the ear of the King half blushing to have gained it by so contemptible an intercessor I perceived chagrin curiosity and disappointment strongly expressed in his really fine features but I  could not prevail on myself to confide aught to the man Prince Henry had despised The Earl took his leave with the same profound deference and assurances of service with which he entered having appointed the next morning for presenting me to the King  As the privacy of the promised audience enabled me to dispense with form I made no addition to my servants nor any other alteration in the weeds I usually wore than that of forming them to the model of my mother's dress which ever rendered the likeness I bore her from my very birth striking and obvious A thousand halfforgotten occurrences pressed upon my agitated soul as I past through each wellknown apartment till all were lost in the present by my reaching the closet of the King The assiduous Somerset drest as elegantly as though he had meant to charm me advanced on my being announced and politely offered me his handa sudden chill came over meI trembled lingereddrooped but  resolved to conquer myself or perish I sook off the scalding tear which hung upon my cheek and accepted the favorite's introductionThe superior air with which I affected to enter was not necessary towards confusing the King who always awkward and perplexed seemed more than usually so and doubtful whether he should not fly the moment he saw me or at least call back Somerset who had instantly retiredBending my knee in compliance with custom I instantly rose and retaining the hand he had presented to me fixed my eyes strongly animated by the occasion on his evervarying countenance "Your Majesty said I doubtless expects to find in me a weak suppliant soliciting protection or suing for your pity but on terms like these I had never bent before youI come to claim a dear and sacred title hitherto unknown but never annihilated Does your heart oh Royal James added I melting into tears recognize nothing congenial to it in these features this voice the timorous  hand which grasps yours for the first time in fraternal allianceOh sainted Mary dear author of my being look down from heaven and touch the heart of your son in favor of the desolate sister who now stands before him" The King started receded gave manifest tokens of doubt and displeasure and sought to draw away the hand I obstinately retainedI kissed I bathed it with impassioned tears "Shake me not off reject me not unknown resumed I in the deep tone of stifled anguishIt is neither pride vanity or ambition which induces me now to publish a secret so long buried in my bosom By the ashes of our anointed mother I conjure you to hearnay even to believe meBorn in obscurityreared in solitude the early victim of misfortune long suffering had reconciled my weary soul to every evil but disgrace against that she still proudly revolts The same blood which flows through your veins burns in tumults along  mine at the very thought of aught unworthyit urges me to assert my innocence by indubitable proofsit  will  be acquitted before men as well as angelsnor does the claim thus avowed rest on my declaration alone your Majesty will see in these papers the solemn attestations the unquestioned handwriting of your royal mother in  these  you will find the corroborating testimonies of many noble and unblemished personsPeruse them cautiously and oh beware how you prejudge me" Unable to utter another word I almost sunk at the feet of James and gave way to the oppressive the agonizing sensations such an aera in my life could not fail to awaken The King still regarded me with an irresolute uneasy air coldly advising me to compose myself by retiring into the antichamber while he perused the papers on which he had hitherto only glanced his eye though even that cursory view had deeply tinged his cheek with silent conviction I was met there  by the Earl of Somerset who perceiving me near fainting ordered water and such essences as are customary remaining himself by my side as if ostentatiously to convince me he did not influence in the least the determination of his royal masterThe bitterness of the conflict was however over the moment the secret was avowed and my spirits soon began to recover their wonted equanimity  The obliging efforts of Somerset to revive me did not pass unnoticed though my watchful ear followed the footsteps of the King who still continued to walk about with an unequal pace stopping at intervals He opened the closet door at length and Somerset retiring out of his sight made signs to me to reenter itThe King came forward to meet me with affability and seizing my hand slightly saluted my cheek"Take courage madam said he for however you may have surprized us with this sudden declaration and wonderful difcovery  reverence for our deceased mother's rights and justice to those you derive from her oblige us to acknowledge you as her daughter"  And now I was indeed near fainting I might rather say dyingTo be at once acknowledged as his sister as the daughter of Mary Scarce in my happiest hours had I dared to flatter myself with the promise of what was now so incredibly realized My susceptible soul indulged the exquisite transport and one short moment compensated for ages of anguishA thousand impassioned incoherent exclamations burst from my lips and giving way to the genuine impulse of gratitude and affection I threw myself for the first time into the arms of a brother nor remembered they were those of a King Never did the most consummate hypocrite counterfeit a joy so pure so perfect and though I could have brought no other proof of my birth the sacred throbs of nature might well have ascertained it  The King sat down by me and turning over the papers he still held questioned me at intervals respecting those that appeared mysterious or deficient I entreated his patience while I briefly ran through the wonderful events of my life and thus very naturally led his attention toward the sole object of my cares my hopes my existence "I have already heard much of your daughter said James they tell me she is beauty itselfwhy have you thus strangely concealed her" As I could not declare my real reason which was simply want of esteem for his character I pleaded various trifling ones that indeed had never influenced me "Say no more said the King interrupting me I easily perceive Madam you was not so reserved to every oneI plainly discern who was your confidant had I earlier been entrusted with your secret it would have been happier for all and I should then have been able to account for"He paused ere he came to the dear name of his son and  sighing dropt the unfinished sentence As to me entranced alike with his unexpected candor graciousness and generosity I severely censured myself for relying on report and not proving the character I ventured to decide upon I had a long conversation with the King afterwards every word of which heightened my confidence esteem and affection I gathered from many expressions that he feared opposition on the part of the Queen and his favorite and was fearful this late declaration of his mother's marriage with the Duke of Norfolk would not fully satisfy the minds of the people or establish my rank sufficiently He paused upon the whole with the air of one who is a party in what he meditates and I thought the least I could do was to leave the regulation of the important acknowledgment in his choiceTo be vindicated in his opinion I truly assured him was the first object of my life and I submitted my general vindication in the public acknowledgment of my birth entirely  to his better judgment That I had been so many years a solitary being in the midst of society as not to have one friend to whose inclination I need yield my own In fine that time had gradually robbed me of all interested in the important secret I had just confided to him which now rested solely with him my daughter and myself He replied that "this instance of my prudence as well as regard infinitely heightened the partiality he had already conceived for me nor need I fear his delaying the acknowledgment longer than was absolutely necessary since he could not but look on such relations as inestimable acquisitions nevertheless as he had many points to consider and many persons to reconcile he recommended to me to continue the same circumspection I had hitherto shewn but that he could not restrain his impatience to behold the fair maid of whom he had heard so much and would come tomorrow evening to a seat of my Lord Somerset's whither  he would send for myself and my daughter and hoped by that time he should be able to ascertain the day for publishing my birth with a due regard for his mother's honor after which he could gratify himself by establishing me in a situation that should make me forget all my misfortunes"Those misfortunes were already forgotten in the unhopedfor transition in my fate I took my leave with the profoundest gratitude burning with impatience to impart this blessed news to my Mary and as the King did not offer to return the papers I thought it better to leave them in his hands than confirm the doubt my long silence could not but give rise to in his mind viz that I wanted confidence in his honor  I hastened to Richmond and communicated this surprizing this happy event to my darling girlA thousand times I ensolded her to my delighted heart and found every transport doubled in her participation She tenderly entered into  all my feelings and sweetly smiled at the eagerness with which I sought to adorn her for the next day's introduction Yet considering the King as the slave of exterior it was a material point to heighten her beauty by every adventitious advantage To present her in absolute black was to recall the most melancholy impressions to the mind of James I therefore resolved to lighten her mourning with a fanciful elegance I drest her in a vest of black velvet thrown back at the bosom in the French sashion with a semicircle of rich lace points which shewed at once her graceful waist and chest to the greatest advantage Her petticoat was of white fattin wrought in deep points round the bottom with black velvet and richly sringed with silver A fuller coat and train of silver muslin wrought with black sell over the sattin one and was looped up to the waist at regular distances by strings of pearl and dragged toward the bottom into points by the weight of  rich black bugle tassels and roses of diamonds Full sleeves of the same silver muslin were braced round her arms to the elbow by strings of jet and roses of diamonds and from thence they were bare except for similar bracelets circling each wrist The rich profusion of her auburn hair which fell in natural curls below her waist required no ornament but to avoid the affectation of shewing it she wore a hat of white sattin with a narrow fringe of black bugles and a waving plume of feathers This splendid dress on which the legacies of both her father and Anana were displayed by some peculiar happiness either in its make or mixture became my Mary beyond any I had ever seen her wear The fond mother's heart anticipated the impression she would infallibly make on her uncle and drew from her heightened beauty the happiest presages  Ah who could have conjectured that this brilliance and parade were only destined to forerun one of the most dismal  moments of my lifeThat an inhuman tyrant had delighted to employ the trembling hand of misfortune in decking a gaudy pageant for herself eternally to mourn over  At the appointed hour a close carriage came for us with due attendants and as the King had desired me not to bring any of my own I rigidly obeyed nor even hinted whither I was going They drove us a long way while engrossed by meditations on the approaching interview as well as concerning the dear creature by me I hardly knew how the time passed My daughter at length observed it was farther than she expectedI looked out but it was too dark for me to distinguish any object and all I could discern was an increase of attendants I called out aloud and one drew near who to my enquiries respectfully replied that the King had been detained in London whither they were hastening by his orders This information quieted us again and I strove to recall my fluttered spirits  into their usual channel by turning the conversation on our future prospects Nevertheless we went at so great a rate that I thought it impossible we should not be near London when all at once I found we were driving through an unknown village The surprize this oceasioned was doubled by my daughter's throwing herself into my armsIt was not immediately I could comprehend her when she told me that a light which gleamed from the window of a cottage had shewn her that we were environed with armed soldiers From this alarm we were not yet recovered when by a sudden rise and hollow sound we perceived we had passed over a drawbridge immediately after which we stopped As we alighted I cast my eyes round a large and dreary courtyard where a few straggling centinels were planted but neither lights splendor or attendants indicated a royal guest or a favorite's residence The gloomy passages through which we were ushered  seemed rather to lead to a prison than a palaceArrived at an empty apartment I gave way at once to the dire the obvious truth and arraigning in silence my own egregious credulity felt severely felt its every consequence  An officer who had preceded us now offered me a packet which I received as the sentence of my fate but made no effort to open itHope fear curiosity every dear and powerful emotion were annihilated by instantaneous conviction and a stupor succeeded more dangerous and dreadful than the most violent operations of the passionsMy daughter more terrified by this still agony than even the cruel and unexpected event of the evening threw herself at my feet"Oh speak to me my mother exclaimed the dear one do not indulge the desperation your countenance expresses do not consummate to your poor Mary the horrors of the moment" I gazed at her with a vacant air but nature resumed her rights and fondly plucking at my heart the tears I refused  to my own fate flowed lavishly for hersSo young so fair so innocent so noble how could I but bewail her Surely those maternal tears alone preserved my senses at a juncture when every thing conspired to unsettle them My Mary by an expressive glance requested leave to open the packet and starting at sight of the paper it contained put it eagerly into my hand a glance informed me it was that defamatory declaration the crafty Burleigh had deceived my sister into signing while a prisoner in St Vincent's Abbey The King in sending this only added insult to injury since the testimonials I had delivered to him might have invalidated a thousand such vague and artificial falshoods yet had it a fortunate effect for nothing less could have roused my spirits from the cold and sullen torpor which every passing moment seemed to increase"Insolent Barbarian exclaimed I not content to imprison the unhappy offspring of the Queen who had the misfortune of giving thee being dost thou delight in  villifying and debasing even her ashesOh paper dictated and preserved surely for my ruin by what singular chance hast thou survived the very views thou wert invented to serveTreasured as it appears only to effect a ruin your execrable contriver could not foreseeYet of what consequence is this single attestation towards annihilating claims all those I delivered had not power to establish in the judgment of a cruel insidious tyranty who voluntarily shut his heart alike to reason virtue and natureDevoted to selfinterest vain of a petty talent at deceiving contemptible in every rank but infamous in the highest he meanly watched the generous impulses of my heart and wrought out of them my ruinYet why do I name myselfAlas of what importance is it to her who no longer wishes to live where heaven or its arbitrary delegate shall have appointed her to dieIt is for thee my daughter for thee alone my soul thus overflows with inexpressible anguishRescued in yet unconscious childhood  from slavery neglect and obscurity fortune at one moment seemed willing to restore all the rights of your birth when a weak credulous unfortunate mother assisted the cruel wretch who Was predetermined to entomb you and annihilate every trace every memorial of our dear and honored progenitorsNamelessdishonoredyour blooming youth must wither in an unknown prisonblighted by the tears of a parent who can never pardon herself the extravagant error produced by overfondnessI knew the King to be mean base subtle yet I madly delivered into his treacherous hands every thing on which our hopes nay even our vindication must be grounded" "Hear me in turn my dear my honored mother cried my sweet girl bathing my hands with tears of veneration and fondness Alas the order of nature is inverted and I am obliged to become the monitorRecollect the maxim you have so deeply impressed upon my mindthat the malice of man would in vain strive to make us wretched did not our  own ungovernable passions aid his artful machinations Oh let us respect even error when it has its source in virtueTo have distrusted the King were to deserve to be rejectedleave him then to the contemptible satisfaction of having wrested from the widow and the orphan the last treasure of their lives and let us examine what he has been compelled to leave us Have we not yet the power of looking down on his throne and all its specious advantages even from that obscure prison where his authority confines usHave we not the pride of reviewing our own hearts without finding aught in either unworthy of our Creator or ourselvesFor the vain grandeur of that name of which he has unfairly deprived us can it be worth regretting while he lives to dishonor itFortunately no favorite view depended on its attainment consequently no hope is blighted by the deprivation Have I not often heard you say a noble mind can become every thing to itselfLet us then rise superior to our fortune time  will soon calm our spiritsreason will reconcile us to the inconveniencies of our fate and religion elevate us above themMourn not then for me my muchloved mother" concluded the dear one sweetly smiling through her tears "since I shall never think that place a prison which contains you nor that fate a misfortune I owe to your fondness"  Oh virtue how awful dost thou appear sublimed thus by generosity When I saw this halfblown human blossom support the storm without shrinking I blushed to have bowed my head before itWhen I heard her with Spartan courage apply to her own situation the noble tenets I had sought not vainly to imbue her mind with could I fail to profit by the principles I had taughtFrom the admiration she excited in my soul sprung that pure and elevated heroism which calms in one moment every human weakness and turbulent passion disposing us to turn upon that fate it enables us to judge of  I now recollected that by a fond vanity in decking my daughter in all her valuable diamonds I had inadvertently provided ample means to buy the fidelity of our keepers nor were they aware of our treasure as the severity of the weather had made me wrap her in a long cloak lined with fur I hastily stripped her costly dress of its richest embellishments and secreted them Ah with what difficulty did I stifle the tears and anguish which struggled at my heart when I remembered the different views with which I adorned her  Scarce had we executed this prudent resolve ere the man I have mentioned presented himself once morehe was youngnot unpleasinghad an air of integrity and profound respect that a little prepossessed me in his favour even under all the disadvantages attending our meeting Our countenances were now calmed and our resolutions takenHe appeared surprized alike with this transition and the beauty of my daughter  whose magnificent but disordered dress had a share of his attentionHe was flattered with our civility and assured us "every accommodation consistent with the strict orders of the King he should take pleasure in supplying us with and would with our permission make us acquainted with our new home" He then produced some keys which opened double doors at the farther end of the large room we were in and conducted us into a chamber neat and commodious enoughThe keys he informed us were committed solely to his charge and that whenever inclination or convenience induced us to change our apartment we had only to touch a spring he pointed out when he would attend and unlock the intermediate doorsThe purport of this extreme caution was very obvious it excluded every possibility of winning over a female servant as all the domestic offices would now of course be performed in either room while we occupied the other nor was he suffered to  supply us pen ink or paper As the conveniences of these apartments and the air of respect in our guard shewed some attention had been paid to our welfare as well as the most judicious precautions taken to prevent our enlargement I neither imputed the one or the other to the King but rather both to his cunning favorite Our enquiries were interrupted by the entrance of two servants who set out an elegant supper of which neither my daughter or myself had spirits to partake Resolved however to gather all I could from my attendant ere another should be put in his place or suspicion make him dumb I asked the name of the Castle and its owner but to these questions he declared himself enjoined to refuse replying nevertheless I conjectured from his looks that I did not err in supposing Somerset directed him The refined artifice of offering to introduce me to the King and even remaining by my side while perhaps my ruin was effecting by his will  seemed entirely consistent with the character Prince Henry had given me of that worthless favorite though I could find no crime in my own conduct could possibly irritate him to bury us thus alive unless indeed our attachment to that lamented royal youth appeared a sufficient one  In the gallery leàding to our apartment I observed a centinel planted from whom we were shut by double doors safely locked perceiving we were thus effectually excluded from every hope and chance of freedom I desired to pass at once into a chamber where I did not flatter myself I should find rest  My first employment on rising was to examine the windows as well as the view from them they were so closely grated as to convince me however comfortable our residence it was still a prison The apartments we occupied formed one side of a quadrangle of old buildings most probably barracks but now entirely deserted On making the signal  Dunlop for so was our guard called readily attended and we passed into the other room where we found breakfast ready Trunks containing all kinds of apparel had been placed there and Dunlop recommended to us to form our minds to passing the remainder of our days in confinement I did not submit to bear this without demanding the authority by which he acted He produced an order signed by the King strictly enjoining him to keep us in safety and beware we neither wrote or received a letler or indeed held any kind of communication with the worldWhile he spoke I examined every lineament of his countenance but fidelity was written there in such legible characters that I dared not make any effort to bribe him lest if it failed he should publish that I had the means which might in a moment utterly impoverish me  A few wearisome uniform days only had elapsed when every hope decayed and my spirits flagged at onceAlas  my mind had no longer the vivifying ardor the inexhaustible resources of unbroken youthits bloom had passed away like a shadow and all its fire evaporatedThe woful realities of life had dissipated the bright illusions of imaginationEvery human good was in my estimation shrunk into so small a compass that freedom constituted a very essential part of my little PossessionsI was no longer able to rely upon contingencies and sunk at once under all the sdness of knowledgeNot denied the relief of books I pored over them in vain every idea was still pursuing an absent good and my senses would reject the sublimest author to follow the careless steps of a weary centinel or listen to his whistling  Whether my daughter had really more resolution than myself or only assumed the appearance of it to save me from despair was a point I could not ascertain but the complacency of her mind and manners was invariable By a thousand little affectionate artifices she engaged me to work while she read or  read while she worked nor would perceive those melancholy reveries it was impossible to overlook I was not however thankless for the blessing left me That my eyes opened on her every morning still made me bless it and in composing myself to sleep I nightly praised the God who yet suffered her to rest by me  Two tedious months elapsed in undecisive projectsDunlop ever present vigilant and respectful precluded alike complaint and temptation but as if to guard himself against the latter I took notice he now never remained one moment alone with us  The impossibility of forming any judgment of our centinels while divided from them by double doors and the danger of a fruitless effort to seduce one had at intervals engrossed my attention but the mind cannot dwell forever on a single idea or a remote and uncertain project Wearied out with this another suddenly came to my relief Though yet early in the spring the weather was uncommonly  beautiful and the lenity with which we were treated left me not without hopes of being allowed under rigid limitations the liberty of walking in whatever gardens the castlewalls enclosed By this means I could examine the countenances of our centinels and if I saw one in whom humanity was not quite extinct I thought I might find some means to shew him a jewel thus proving I could largely recompense him should he have the courage to assist us Nor did my lameness wholly deprive me of the power of walking though it prevented my enjoying the libertyAfter considering this plan in every possible light I saw nothing to forbid the attempt and ventured the requestA few anxious days elapsed ere I had the satisfaction of finding it was granted on as good terms as I could hope Dunlop acquainted me we must walk separately that the person confined might be a check upon her that was liberated who should not remain in the garden more than an  hour nor quit his sight one moment These restrictions were as moderate as I could expect and I eagerly prepared to profit by the granted permission ere I ventured my daughter certain I should at least discover the strength heighth and situation of the CastleDunlop followed by two other men attended upon me I cast an eager eye on the centinel on the gallery but saw in him no trace of sense feeling or curiosity I found the little garden in so antique a stile and ruinous a condition as plainly proved this dismantled building was now only a prison whatever its former distinction The wall around it appeared decayed and not very highit looked down on a moat apparently dryFrom one part of the terrace I caught the corner of a tower I fancied belonged to Windsor Castle but dared not venture a word which might imply design and returned without asking a single question My daughter now took her turn and as we continued to claim  this relief whenever the weather favored I fancied it improved her health as well as my own  It chanced at length I one day found a centinel on guard whose eye expressed both pity and curiosityMine addressed itself to him in a most pointed manner Without altering the position of my hand in which I always carried a diamond for that purpose I opened it and the soldier as I wished surveyed the jewelI turned my head at the instant Dunlop was unlocking the door and the centinel shook his emphatically Yet only to have been understood revived at once my spirits and my hopes for to escape did not appear so impracticable to me as to gain an assistant I saw him no more for a week but soon found that day was the periodical one for his attendanceInvolved in a thousand plots the want of pen and ink seemed to condemn them all to inhabit only my brain when at once I discovered a substitute for those useful articles From the middle  of a large book which we had unmolested possession of I took some of the printed leaves and from the conclusion a blank one out of the first I cut such words as simply conveyed my meaning and sewed them on the last"Assist us to escape and we will make your fortune" was the substance of this singular but important billet To ascertain my ability to realize this promise I wrapt in it a diamond of some value and carried both ever in my hand still hoping fortune would enable me for one moment to mislead the attention of my guards but alas Dunlop far from relaxing his vigilance continually increased it The two men who followed him in the garden now attended to my door remaining as spies on me while Dunlop opened itThus circumstanced I could not make the slightest overture without being liable to detection and I dreaded awakening the most distant doubt lest it should condemn us to a more rigorous confinementOne favorable omen alone  occurredThe soldier I had selected clearly understood meI saw his eye ever anxiously fixed on my hand as if eager to transfer its contents to his own nor had I ceased to flatter myself I should yet do so when an unforeseen incident at once annihilated every hope and project and plunged me in the deepest sorrow  I had always counted the moments of my daughter's absence and nothing but the conviction that the air and exercise were necessary towards her health could have enabled me to support it What then became of me when one day I found her walk unusually lengthenedI endeavoured to persuade myself that my fears foreran the dangerBut more than twice the usual time had certainly elapsed nor dared I venture an enquiry lest I should suggest a hint to my persecutors which hitherto had escaped them The hours thus passed on but Mary returned notAh me while my weak hand repeats this I almost expire  under the recollectionEvery evil my untoward fate had yet teemed with became peace nay pleasure on a comparison with thisThough the turbulence of each succeeding storm had swept away invaluable treasures something yet remained my weary soul might cling toThis single gem this solitary relique of all my fortunes more dear more precious from becoming so a dreadful a deceitful calm had at length swallowed up even while I was fearless of the dangerHeartstruckincapable at once either of distinguishing or complaining my respiration became perturbed and deepA still agony more dreadful than the wildest tumults of the passions numbed my very soul every hair seemed to start from and pierce my toosensible brain while drops cold as those of death chased one another down my scarcely throbbing templesWhen Dunlop presented himself I rose not from the earth I uttered not a syllable but lifting an eye to him which would have melted a savage he  turned away unable to support the shock and offered me some order from the King bewailing at the same moment the painful duty imposed on him This roused my torpid spiritsI tore it indignantly into a thousand atomsresentment restored my speechI called for my Mary in the most piercing accentsnothing could suspend or mitigate my anguish I bitterly reproached Dunlop with tearing the beauteous innocent from her mother's bosom only to deliver her up to assassinsIn vain he declared himself incapable of such villainy and acting under the orders of the Kingin vain he assured me she was only removed to another apartment safe and unhurtMy soul rejected all his assertionsMary MaryMarywas all my convulsed lips could utter or my disconsolate soul dictate  Ah God the solitude that succeeded Food light air nay even life itself became nauseous and insupportableStretched on the cold grounddrenched in my own tears I gave way to the deep  misery the tremendous void this barbarous separation could not but plunge me inHow long was it since she had been the very essence of my existence From the sorrowful moment which gave her into my arms to that which tore her from them she she alone had occupied my every sense and enabled me to support every afflictionNever though I had led her myself through an admiring nation to the altar and joined her hand with that of the incomparable Henry never could even that advantage have compensated to my yearning heart for the loss of her society What then must it suffer to recollect a savage had wrested her for unknown purposes from my armsNor could I amid all the horrors this idea teemed with fix on any distinct one  Oh that melodious voiceStill it seemed to vibrate on my ear but no longer could I hear itThat unmatched form glistered through every tear but evaporated with it The most deadly glooms came over mea thousand times  I raised my rash hand to precipitatethe unfortunate Rose Cecil alone withheld meI often thought I heard her aerial voice and despair slowly subsided into resignation  I now exerted every effort to gain upon Dunlop but too faithful to his execrable employers I never won more from him than that my daughter was still in the Castle not only unhurt but treated with distinction and indulgenceYet how could I credit such improbable assurances or even if they were true ought not an indulgence so partial to alarm more strongly a mother's feelings To every solicitation once more to behold her I received a positive denial nor was even the liberty of walking now allowed me I often enquired why I was thus restrained if no injury was meditated to my unfortunate child To questions of this kind he never answered but left me to my own fluctuating conjectures They were so numerous and frightful that conviction could hardly aggravate the evil Nevertheless as Dunlop seemed  ever anxious to compose my mind by reiterated assurances of my poor girl's safety and as there was an air of candor in all he uttered I began at length to conclude that the contemptible Somerset had aspired to the niece of his master but from being already married to the divorced Countess of Essex had not dared to avow his passion I recollected too late the singularity of his being with Prince Henry when first we beheld that amiable youththe assiduous respect he had shewn in waiting on me at Richmondthe affected offer of his interest with a tyrant whose will he so well knew how to make subservient to his ownthe combination of refined arts by which we had been led to throw ourselves into the prison selected for usand finally that the prison was probably a house of his ownThrough the whole of this as well as the manner we were guarded there was a policy too minute for a King to plan and too watchful to be the work of an indifferent personWhen by a just turn of thought we insensibly  unravel any hitherto inexplicable event how does the mind disdain its former blindness I now considered with wonder my long want of perspicacity and found something every moment to corroborate and strengthen the idea I had adopted  To fix on any thing certain appears to the exhausted soul a degree of relief and though at some moments I dreaded art and violence might be employed if gentle methods failed to undermine the virtue of my sweet girl yet I much oftener flattered myself she could not inspire a passion so gross and unworthy and knew her soul superior to every other seduction From the instant I ventured once more to hope all my plans for escaping revived I had no longer it is true the privilege of passing beyond my apartment but misery is ever ingenious and I was preinformed of the days when the compassionate centinel guarded the door nay I fancied I often heard him draw near attracted by my sighs and groansThe note I had formerly prepared was  yet in being I sewed it to a long thin slip of whalebone and on the day when he used to be attending worked it gently under both doors at a time when I judged no other person near and softly rapped at the inner one A sweet hope rekindled in my heart as I felt it drawn out of my hand I watched in vain the whole tedious day for a reply and often fancied my effort had been betrayed to Dunlop but as I did not perceive any alteration in his countenance I became reassured and concluded that the soldier could not write nor perhaps even read and if so a whole week must necessarily elapse ere I could learn his resolutions The expiration of that time verified my last conjecture With unspeakable satisfaction I at last saw a billet introduced into my solitude by the same means I had successfully ventured I was a long time decyphering the almost unintelligible scrawl "I pity you lady from my heart but I know not how to help you it is true you are rich and I am very poor but then it is impossible to get at you if  you can think of any way I am ready to assist" Ah God how did I lift up my eyes to thee who hadst thus strangely opened once more to me a communication with that society from which I had been so unfairly wrested In moments like this every thing appears possible already I seemed to see my prison gates open my daughter in my arms and our honest assistant rich at once in our wealth and our blessings Having had the foresight to prepare another billet I conveyed it in the same manner "Worthy soldier is my daughter safe and yet in this Castle if so tear away all but the word yes and my soul shall for ever bless you" How pure was the joy with which I received the precious monosyllable  To prepare another billet comprehending my plan was a work of timewith what perturbation did I undertake it To condense my meaning to a few words and yet leave it obvious to a common capacity was not an easy taskI thus  at last effected it "generous friend win over him who guards my daughter's door while you are at mine and I will share with both of you the rich jewels I possess of which you saw only the smallest Observe the form of the keys Dunlop bringsbuy many as near them as possible and so various that some may certainly fitProcure likewise two regimental suits that we may pass the gate unquestioned if you can raise the little money necessary for this fear not to spend it I will make your fortune in the moment our doors are openedRestore me to my daughterconduct us to the gate and we will both beseech the Almighty to bless the riches we will joyfully leave in your hands"  Having dispatched this I waited the deciding hour with the most anxious impatience and scarce dared to raise my eyes from the ground lest Dunlop should read in them aught that might alarm his suspicions  How to dispose of myself and daughter when out of the Castle was a question I could not decide upon but I flattered myself that as we should have some hours start of our persecutors we might reach London where it would not be easy to apprehend persons who had been imprisoned without any judicial enquiry or sentenceA greater fear however than that occurredHow if these soldiers should not be honestthe reward we must bestow would prove what we possessed and our lives might be the forfeit Yet such was my desperate state that even this reasonable apprehension did not induce me one moment to hesitate  The appointed time revolved and I received another billet "Be ready when all is quietevery thing is prepared if any of the keys fit My comrade and self must go with you to secure our own safety but it will likewise secure yours" Oh how did my heart bound at this happy intelligencemy languor my lameness all was forgotten Maternal love and habitual  fear seemed to wing me with supernatural powers  As the important moment approached I knelt and devoutly invoked the assistance of heaven Ah not in vain for the first effort of the soldiers was successful I reached out a rich and ready hand to eachThey received the contents with extreme satisfaction and conjuring me to preserve the most profound silence locked the doors and led me to the further side of the Castle At the threshold of my daughter's apartment they gave into my hand the disguises I had desired and agreed to wait till we were ready The tender meltings Mothers only know thrilled thro' my heart and sweetened every apprehension as I gently made my way thro' a dark room towards one where I saw lights still burning but fearful of alarming my sweet girl I hesitated at the door What was my astonishment to perceive that the apartment was gay magnificient and illuminatedI thought at first that anxiety had bewildered my faculties  but their truth became evident when they centred at once on my daughter who elegantly habited had sunk on a couch asleep A writing table covered with due implements stood before her on which lay a letter it appeared to me she had been answering The deadly coldness the nameless sensations this extraordinary scene could not but occasion at once suspended even the most powerful emotions of nature A repulsion so terrible obliged me to rest my head against the pillar of the door and struggle some time with the sickness and confusion of my soul ere I could gather strength to penetrate into the fact She still continued to enjoy a repose it seemed to me I never should know again and I had now lost the wish of awakening her of escapingalas even of existing Slowly at length I tottered toward the table and catching at the two letters I mentioned appeared to grasp in them my very fate The signature of the first made its contents  almost needless "A few days a very few days more most charming of women and I shall be able to indulge your every wishevery thing is now in trainpain me not therefore in thus pressing an impossibility The heart of your Mother is inexorable to meit has ever been so and I neither dare trust her with the truth or you with one so prejudiced till the law shall have annulled my detested marriage and the King agree to my union with yourselfI live but in that hope it supports me under all these long and tedious absences Why will you call the safe home in which you are enclosed a prisonThe whole world appears so to him who beholds with pleasure only that spot where you dwell Tomorrow I shall steal an hour to pass with yousmile for that hour my beloved and bless wiih a welcome your devoted Somerset"  Of what various what manifold miseries is the human heart susceptible none of all the exquisite variety I had hitherto known ever surpassed this new  one My disdainful soul recoiled from even the dear object of its affectionshypocrisy that essence of all vices had stolen into her heart under the name of love and blighted the virtues yet blossomingfearfully I perused her letter to end every doubt  "What ages of solitude of suffering does your love my lord impose on me In vain you would fill up that place in my heart a parent so justly revered must ever hold But you still talk of tomorrow and tomorrowalas it is a day that may perhaps never comeyou think me vapourish but you know not how strangely my illness increasesit is acute and violentOh that I could lay my burning head one moment on my mother's bosomCatherine gave me some whey yesterday I don't know perhaps I wrong her but I have not been myself since A thousand gloomy images have taken possession of my mind my eager ear is filled with imaginary knells I could fancy myself dying you will laugh perhaps  at this weakness but I cannot conquer itif I should indeed judge right release my mother I conjure you and conceal forever from her"  Ah what exclaimed I in the most terrible agony for at this unfinished sentence the letter broke offDisdain suspense anguish contended within me and shook my frame like the last struggle of natureOf all the horrors that bewildered my mind one one alone could my senses ascertainMy hapless girl was indeed dyingwan and sunken were those cheeks late so floridthe icy fingers of death were impressed upon her temples and the eyes she heavily opened as her woestruck mother dropt upon earth had no longer either life beauty or lustreOh that my soul had escaped in the groan which followed this horrible convictionShe faintly shrieked and remained in a kind of stupor tenderness however soon predominated over every other sensationI threw my arms round her in silence and the tears which deluged her cheeks alone declared what  passed in my soulStill she uttered not a word but griped my hands as though the pangs of death were indeed upon her I in vain conjured intreated her to speak it was long ere she had courage to enter into a detail which she had neither breath or voice to go through "Condemn me not wholly my mother at length cried the dear one however appearances may incense you I ask for only life enough to acquit myself and will to my last moment thank the God who restores me to your arms though only to blush away my being in them Yet have I no other crime to avow than that reserve unconquerably interwoven in my natureAlas yesterday I thought it a virtueHeaven will perhaps give me strength to go through the story at least I ought to make the effortOh deign to pardon my compelled abruptness and hear me with patience  "At the moment which first presented Prince Henry to our knowledge he was accompanied by the Earl of SomersetHow my eyes conceived the partiality my  reason could never erase I know not but they decided at once in his favorWhether the Earl perceived the involuntary distinction or was led by an equal one on his own part is alike unknown to me but I understood the reluctance with which he gave way to the Prince whom he left with usthe contempt with which you mentioned Lord Somerset strangely shocked and alarmed me yet may I own it I secretly accused the most upright heart existing of pride and prejudice and found a thousand reasons for suddenly disputing a judgment which had hitherto been the rule of my own During the frequent visits Prince Henry paid you when prudence induced you to send me abroad alas to what a temptation did you unconsciously expose me Somerset availed himself of those opportunities and by distant homage confirmed the prepossession I had already conceivedWhat shame what sorrow what humiliation has it cost meCan you ever know a more exquisite misery than to bestow your heart unworthily  to be humbled without guiltcompelled to blush hourly for errors not your ownand reduced to a perpetual conflict with those powerful and natural emotions which form under more fortunate circumstances the felicity of youth Sensible by the curious attention of others how injurious that of the Earl might in time become I requested leave to remain at home and awed in spite of myself by your sentiments boldly resolved to sacrifice the erroneous inclination of my heart and received the vows of Prince Henry To see you happy to flatter him with the hope of being so for a time elevated and amused my mind but solitude soon restored it to its favorite object Somerset still presented himself and I took pleasure in the tears in which I drowned his admired image By some means or other I found letters from him frequently in my chamberI dared not enquire how lest I should awaken your suspicions alas perhaps that was one of the finespun webs with which love  ever veils its errors I found him regularly informed of all our designsI knew it was in his power to cross them by a word and I began to esteem him for daring to be silent During the last progress of the King Somerset resolved to profit by the absence of Henry and apprized of the interviews we granted the Prince in the pavilion in the garden as well as of my habit of sitting there determined to take the chance of pleading his cause My stay was by the rising of the moon unusually prolonged on the evening he had selected to present himself before me The pale light served only to shadow out his formany human one must at such a moment have appalled meI shrieked and was halffainting when the found of his voice dissipated my terror Surprize perhaps joy that instantaneous confidence we ever repose in the object beloved doubtless reassured him I was scarce conscious I had granted the audience he demanded till he fell at my feet to thank me The manner in which  he avowed his passion made me sensible too late that I had illdisguised my own I know not whether I should have had resolution to attempt doing so much longer had not our conversation been suddenly interrupted by Henry The Prince to my inexpressible dismay entered the pavillionMy voice had drawn him thither but the sound of Somerset's made him retreat in contemptuous silence The Earl would have followed but I caught his arm and obstinately withheld himthen conjuring him to hasten to his boat I flew after the Prince Henry had thrown himself on the seat near the terrace but sensible of the necessity of separating him and the Earl at such a crisis I intreated the Prince to accompany me to the house The light of the moon enabled me judge from his bewildered air of the distraction of his mind I had not courage to break a silence he voluntarily maintained yet to part under appearances so equivocal was impossible I hesitated at length a faint explanation  nation "Could you contradict the evidence of my senses madam sighed the Prince in a low and tender tone I might wish to hear you as it is spare me I conjure you on a subject so hateful I have nothing to reproach you with but a reserve which led me to deceive myselfAdieu I promise you inviolable silenceHe who once hoped to constitute your felicity disdains to interfere with it Yet one truth I ought perhaps to apprize you of your happy your favored lover is married think not I wish to reap any advantage from this informationnever more shall I breathe a vow at your feetOh Mary you have undone me" He wrung my hands in an agony of passion and rushed through the garden to conceal the sobs which continued to pierce my heart through my ear What a night did I passsad prelude to so many miserable ones I readily absented myself the next day at the Prince's usual hour of visiting us I never saw him afterwards without pain humiliation  and constraint though he omitted nothing likely to reconcile me to himself During the fatal illness into which he fell how continually did my heart reproach me with increasing if not causing it and how deeply was my injustice to his merit punished in the mortifying conviction that Somerset had dared to deceive me What prayers did I offer up for Henry's recovery What vows to atone for my error by a life devoted to him Alas I was not worthy a lover so noble and heaven recalled his purer essence while yet unsullied The sense of a hopeless and unworthy passion mingled with the deep grief I could not but feel for his loss A sickliness and disgust succeededrank royalty distinction every worldly advantage combined could not have dissipated the gloom of my mind or reconciled me for a moment to society I took no pleasure in the hopes you my dear my generous mother cherished for me but I would not be ungrateful and therefore concealed  my ideas Thus impressed what merit was there in that philosophy which enabled me to become your comforter under a reverse I scarcely felt Oh that my errors my misfortunes had ended herethat I had breathed my last on your revered bosom while yet unconscious of wounding it When the vain hope of freedom made you solicit for a limited portion of air and exercise how could you foresee the fatal consequences of that periodical indulgence In the first of these solitary walks Somerset presented himself before me not the crested aspiring favorite but the selfaccusing the pale the humble loverMy eyes resisted the impulse of my heart and turned haughtily from him but he hung on my robe he intreated he conjured he  would  be heardI feel I shall not have time to enter into the long explanation of his conduct which won from me an unwilling pardon suffice it to say that he knew every the most secret transaction in our house nor ventured to marry till convinced I was  betrothed to Prince Henry But oh the wretch he espousedNever may you know the crimes of which she has too probably been guilty It was to Somerset's interposition we owed the prolongation of those lives the pride and rage of the King had devoted from the moment he read the papers he took a malicious pleasure in destroyingStill anxious for me the Earl owned he had persuaded James to imprison us in this Castle as well to secure our safety as to provide us those comforts and conveniencies our royal relation would have deprived us of  I could not be insensible to services like these and finding my wrath began to abate he awakened my pity by describing the domestic miseries an unhappy marriage had imposed on him The tears with which my wounded soul blotted this picture induced him still farther to explain himself His hopes of a divorce seemed rationally grounded and I could not but enter into his views  on that headI was not however able to persuade him you would ever think as I did and weakly promised a secresy I ought to have seen the danger ofYet the prejudice which induced you to impute even our imprisonment to him seemed so fixed so unalterable that though a thousand times the integrity of my nature tempted me to unfold to you the only secret my bosom ever teemed with I shrunk before a mind so disgusted nor dared to utter one syllable might pain you The delays of Somerset however necessary alarmed and distressed meI became cold and melancholy and too delicate to confide to him the true causes of this alteration he soon assigned a false one Peevishness and altercation now robbed our interviews of all their sweetnessHe often reproached me with having opened my heart to you who alone could thus shut it against himDisdain urged me one day to assure him I would do so the first moment I again beheld youHe left me in a transport of rage Alas my heart  became sensible of one every way equal to it when I found I was not permitted to return to your prisonI refused to admit him to that allotted for me and gave vent to every extravagance so unforeseen an injury must exciteHis answer convinced me that this step had long been meditated He assured me "he would sooner die than restore me to a mother who had ever hated detested and despised him without any reason till his claim took place of hers and he could call me his wife" The cruel remembrance of what you must suffer soon reduced me to intreaties and solemn promises of continued secresy "They were now he replied too latethat he could not suppose it possible I should be able to conceal from you the cause of my absence and this justly strengthening the unreasonable disgust and hatred you already felt towards him would make you go any lengths to prevent a union you must naturally abhor"To this he added all he thought likely to soothe my  embittered spirit and solemnly assured me your mind was relieved by a conviction that this separation was only in consequence of a new order from court Although I saw in this mode of conduct a chicanery and little art my nature disdained I was yet glad to imagine it lightened to you the heavy affliction our separation could not but cause I felt too late the error of mental reservation and had sufficient reason to think every evil might branch out from that little root Having in vain contended with the man no less master of my life than fate I at length was wearied into forgiving him The divorce was now in great forwardness and the manifold iniquities of the fiend in human shape he had married such as could not but shock and interest a heart disposed to love him A thousand busy projects passed daily from his brain to mine and often intervened between myself and a mother so revered Every hour that went over my head made it more impossible for me to appear before  you but as his wife and I became as eager as himself for a day which heaven had preordained I should never see One who pursued her point more effectually has severely punished all my youthful errorsOh may my premature death be received by him who made me as an expiationHow shall I tell youand yet I mustI have often thought my food tinctured with poisonyesterdayAlas my mother where is now your fortitude where is that sublime resignation I have seen you exertforget the vain hopes you once formed for meforget that I am your daughter oh think the erring wretch this awful moment recalls was born to embitter the days that yet remain to you and adore even in this painful moment the mercy of the AlmightyIf have not sinned beyond forgiveness graciously extend yours to me while yet I am sensible of the blessing"  As she threw herself into my arms every feature seemed shrunk and moulded by the fingers of deathAlas what became  of me at this crisis her paroxysms were scarce more dreadful than those that seized upon my soulevery emotion of love friendship and kindred appeared tranquillity when compared with the wild uncontroulable anguish of the robbed the ruined mother Perpetually ready to give vent to the tumultuous execrations my heart pronounced against the artful insidious traitor who had alienated her affections and warped the rectitude of her mind an intuitive conviction that such a transport would vainly embitter the little time remaining to her obliged me to confine to sighs and groans all the miseries of the moment I drew her fondly to my bosom and poured over her pale convulsed cheeks a heartbroken mother's solemn absolution  One horror only could be added to a scene like this nor was it wanting The centinels weary of waiting and startled by our groans now abruptly entered the chamberScared at the sight of my daughter expiring in my arms the sense  of their own danger soon overruled every other they urged they conjured me to leave my Mary now apparently lifeless but they urged they conjured in vainOn her I was so soon to resign to her Creator my whole soul was now fixedThe dear one faintly revived but struck with inconceivable horror at sight of the soldiers she relapsed into convulsions griping me still closer Ah God the cold chill that followed when I found her hold relax at oncethe world vanished from before my eyesthey beheld only the fair form which sought a grave on the bosom where it first found a beingInspired with the fierceness of a savage I grasped her yet closer shrieking tremendously and with a strength surely supernatural The confused and incensed soldiers having used every persuasion in vain made the most violent efforts to sever me from the last the dearest the only object of my love Threats intreaties art and force however were alike vainnothing could  could tear her from me They presented at length their bayonets to my bosom and beheld me with surprize dare the blowPerhaps they had really pierced it but that some women attendant on my daughter now rushed into the room Fears for their own safety obliged the soldiers to forbear urging or enforcing me further They seized the intruders lest any of them should escape and having bound them sought safety in flight A terrible calm succeeded my intense desperationthe blood which had tumultuously burnt along every vein now returned in torrents to choak up and drown my heartThe black fumes mounted thence to my brainWith a griefglazed eye I contemplated the pale and precious cheek from whose rich coloring I of late drew life till ignorant that I either suffered or existed  Seldom enough myself to distinguish the shadowy forms that flitted round my bed and always too indifferent to utter a single question I opened not the curtain nor cared who was beyond it Vague and stifled exclamations alone informed me of the danger of that fatal fire which raged within my veinsdanger did I sayI ought rather to have called it relief During the short intervals of my delirium I voluntarily sunk in silence under the gloom and debility it left Suddenly I was seized with such flutters and gaspings as seemed to indicate an immediate termination of every human inflictionMy weary soul hovered at the gate of its prison and I felt as if a single word would release it but I had neither ability or inclination to pronounce that word and though I perceived every curtain was undrawn to give me air I raised not my quivering eyelids to distinguish the two persons who anxiously held each hand as watching for  the last beat of the faint and hurried pulse  While thus in the very struggle and fluctuation incident to parting nature a voice suddenly reached my receding sensesa voice so mellow calm and holy that life yet lingered on it I distinguished these words "oh Almighty God with whom do live the spirits of the just made perfect when they are delivered from their earthly prisons we humbly commend the soul of this thy servant our dear sister into thy hands as into those of a faithful Creator and most merciful Saviour" A faint effort I made to release my hands with the design of raising them towards heaven caused the prayer to cease An emotion I could not resist made me lift my dim eyes to behold if not absolutely an angel the human being that most resembled one At a table near my bed knelt a Clergyman whose reverend locks time had entirely bleached but it had taken nothing from his fine eyes which seemed  to reflect the divinity he servedcare and experience had worn traces in every perfect feature and the pale purity of virtue chastened alike by sorrow and resignation had succeeded to the vivid hues of youth hope and health I uttered a sigh and faint exclamationA sweet yet sad pleasure wandered through my exhausted frame thus to be assured I had reached the very point of my being Some women decently arrayed in black having assisted my infirm and venerable comforter to rise conducted him to the side of my bed and retired With a graciousness peculiar to himself he adjured me since the mercy of the Almighty had unexpectedly restored my intellects to prosit by the indulgence in preparing my soul to appear before him An impulse of gratitude made me raise my hand to take his that sympathetically trembled over me but even this trifling motion made me sensible I had on many blisters which wrung my feeble sense even to fainting  The women as is usual in desperate cases gave me some vivifying cordials and again retired The reverend stranger once more addressed me praising the Almighty for the restoration of my intellectsthey were indeed restored for oh the recollection of that dismal event which rendered their loss a blessing returned upon my mind and made me loath the succors I could owe only to the detested hand that had consummated my woes "Oh you cried I in a broken voice who thus seek to comfort the miserable inform me first to whom I owe the benefit" He paused a momenthis gracious eyes glanced upward and having thus consulted with his Creator he answered me with firmness "that his name was De Vere the houshold Chaplain of the Earl of Somerset"At that abhorred title I shut my eyes as though I could have shut out retrospection and waved to him to leave me"Rash unfortunate woman returned he in a solemn and yet tender tone religion  does not permit me to obey youwould you bear into a better world the pride the passions the prejudices which have certainly embittered perhaps shortened your days in thisDare you present to the pure source of good your great your glorious Creator a soul yet sullied with voluntary frailties and human imperfection Are you not on the point of ceasing to fuffer wherefore then should you not cease to resent Religion enjoins you to forget the faults of others and contemplate only your ownAttend to truth and I will impart it to youresolve to be patient and I will pour balm into the deep wounds of human calamitycontroul your passions and I will elevate them even under the struggles of parting nature by hopes which shall surely be realized because they centre in immortality"The author of universal being seemed to speak to me through his Ministerthe gathering tumult stood suspended "You address not an ingrate returned I feebly I have walked in peace  life with my God and fain would I die so though surely to remember the wretch who precipitates me into eternity by a grief too pungent for endurance with charity or composure exceeds my ability If you have aught to reveal that may allay this irritation be truly generous in unfolding itif otherwise present such images only to my mind as may drive from it that of a villain whose offences you cannot extenuate nor double the agonies even you cannot relieve" "It is my only intention madam replied heAlas I would not probe your wounds even to heal themIf it is necessary to suffer ere we can feel believe me I want not even that power of sympathizing with you yet must I reconcile my divine and human character by vindicating the innocent while I soothe the unfortunate though even the wealth of nations could not tempt me for one moment to palliate guilt Have you courage to hear a letter given me in hopes of the present opportunity" I  controuled myself and signed to him to read  "In what words most injured most unfortunate of women shall the wretch who has unconsciously destroyed your peace and his own deprecate the wrath his very idea must occasionAlas overwhelmed with grief horror despair every killing sensation guilt alone excepted his punishmeent is as acute as even malice could wish it  "To fill up the measure of my afflictions I am informed that the blow which has robbed my soul of its dearest hope struck at your lifethat even in the wildness of delirium your curses pursue me and you are ready to sink into the grave with unabated hatredIf returning recollection should ever enable you to read or hear these genuine dictates of a breaking heart do it madam I conjure you the late justice of an acquittal By the spotless spirit of the dear lost angel my fatal love deprived you of hear pityif possible forgive meCan you  for a moment believe I would have touched a life dear precious to me even as to yourself  The abandoned woman to whom heaven as a punishment for all my sins united me discovered by some unknown means those views I thought impenetrable and foreseeing in their completion her own disgrace and ruin she took a deadly means to save herself from bothAlready but too familiar with poison and with death she found among the maids attending on my dear lost love one base enough to aid her in translating an angel too early to the skies To say that I hate detest and shun the execrable monster is surely needlessI even resign her to your justice nor do I wish to shelter myself from it if you still think me guilty  "The last words of an expiring saint are not more ardent more sincere than those I now utterOh strive then to live madam nor let my agonized soul have the additional misfortune of shortening  ening your days and lingering under your curse"  Alas of what importance are these late convictionsWhen a ball has gone through the heart we are incapable of heeding the quarter it comes from  I could not however refuse credence to this letter and accusing myself of having hitherto perhaps wanted candor towards the author I acquitted myself to him by affording him my forgiveness  Nature ever shrinking from dissolution is easily recalled to a lingering sufferance but the exhausted soul no more can recover its powers The activity which once supported me was gone forever  The venerable divine I have mentioned still watched over me and by the holiest consolations contended with the apathy into which I was sinkingBut who could heal a heart broken by so many sorrows That it  was  broken alone could console me Destined to turn my dim eyes around this vast globe without  findidg one object on which they could rest De Vere led them towards heaven he bade me remember that my treasure was only removed not taken wholly from me and that every passing day brought me nearer to recovering it  For the execrable woman who had to the ruin of her own soul murdered the only hope of mine I ventured not to imagine a punishmentI dared not trust myself with so dangerous a wish No I consigned her to the God she had offended and he has even in this world fearfully avenged me  The pious De Vere shewed by preserving and restoring my jewels the equity of his nature and I made him such acknowledgments as must flatter his heart and establish his fortune As soon as I thought myself equal to the journey I resolved to retire to France that I might at least expire in peace and besought him to accompany meNot able without ingratitude immediately to quit his patron he comforted me with the  hopes of soon partaking my voluntary exile  How unworthy the man who won the innocent heart of my translated angel ever was of it I had soon another convincing proofBecause I resisted the impulses of despairbecause I listened to the dictates of virtue and religion and deigned to live out the days appointed by the Almighty his narrow soul began to believe mine susceptible of human consolation he dared to intrude upon me in the name of the King late offers of acknowledgment distinction fortuneHeavens how could either imagine I would owe aught to those I must alike look down uponThe very idea had well nigh disarranged my feeble faculties and destroyed the religious composure of my grief It however convinced me that no opposition would be made to my quitting that prison in which I left alas all worth enclosingI launched once more into the immense world unknownunindeared and willing to be so  My fever returned on my landing in France with the most mortal symptomsAh can I fail here to commemorate the second angel heaven sent to my assistance The arrival of the Embassador in his way toward England though at first an inconvenience in so narrow an asylum as an inn eventually prolonged my days His dear and lovely daughter was informed of my stateshe indulged the sublime impulse of humanity which led her towards the bed where lay a forlorn wretch who appeared ready to draw her last breath in silent affliction She summoned her noble father's physician whose skill relieved one it could not saveShe even deigned to outstay the Embassador and by a glorious principle known only to superior natures began to love the wretch she succored A virtue so exemplary almost reconciled me to the world I am shortly to quit Sweet Adelaide when in this faint portrait you survey yourself sigh for those decaying powers which cannot render it more striking  That my decline has been prolonged till this narrative is concluded I do not regret and by compliance I have evinced my sense of your friendshipI have now only to dieYet alas it is with regret I present to your youthful eyes so melancholy a chart of my yoyage through lifeSuffer it not to damp your hopes but rather let it blunt your sense of misfortune for have I not said already that consummate misery has a moral use in teaching the repiner at little evils to be juster to his God and himselfGlorious though inscrutable are all his ways and short as my time now is he has suffered me to see his righteous retribution Condemnation infamy and solitude are henceforth the portion of Somerset and his execrable CountessA similar crime long buried in oblivion has been proved upon them without my having once disturbed the sacred ashes of my Mary An act so atrocious has broke the tye which bound De Vere to the Earl and I every day expect him I struggle to retain my last breath till I can give it up in his presence assured  that his superior soul will prepare my frail one for along hereafter and decently dispose of the mortal frame I soon must leave behind me  Dear and lovely friend you are now in EnglandAlready perhaps your feet have trod lightly over those spots where my happiness witheredAh if sensibility should lead you more thoughtfully to retrace them check every painful emotion by recollecting I shall then be past the power of sufferingYet when your noble father reconducts you to the home you was born to embellish grant a little to the weakness of mortality and linger once more on the spot where we met the pious De Vere will there attend your comingAccept from his hand the casket I bequeath and suffer him to lead you to the nameless grave where he shall have interred my ashes drop on it a few of those holy tears with which virtue consecrates misfortune then raise your eyes with those of your venerable conductor and in a better world look for MATILDA
