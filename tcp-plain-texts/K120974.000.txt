 THE NonJuror  A COMEDY  As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL  BY His MAJESTY'S Servants  Written by Mr  CIBBER  Pulchra Laverna  Da mihi fallere da Justum Sanctum{que} videri  Noctem Peccatis Fraudibus

Woodvil  Mrs  Porter  Mrs  Lyddal  Maria  Mrs  Oldfield  Mrs  Vanderbank  The SCENE an Anti chamber of Sir  JOHN'S  House in  LONDON  TO THE KING  SIR  IN a Time when all Communities Congratulate Your MAJESTY on the  Glories  of Your Reign which are continually rising from the  Prosperities  of Your People be graciously pleas'd  Dread Sir  to permit the lowest of Your Subjects from the  Theatre  to take this Occasion of offering their most Humble Acknowledgments for Your Royal Favour and Protection  YOUR Comedians SIR are an Unhappy Society whom some Severe Heads think wholly Useless and others Dangerous to the Young and Innocent This Comedy is therefore an Attempt to remove that Prejudice and to shew what Honest and Laudable Uses may be made of the  Theatre  when its Performaces keep close to the true Purposes of its Institution That it may be necessary to divert the Sullen and Dissaffected from busying their Brains to disturb the Happiness of a Government which for want of proper Amusements they often enter into Wild and Seditious Schemes to reform And that it may likewise make those very Follies the Ridicule and Diversion even of those that committed them Our Labours have at least this Glory to boast That since Plays were first Exhibited in  England  they were never totally suppress'd but by those very People that turn'd our  Church  and  Constitution  into  Irreligion  and  Anarchy  OF all Errors those that are the Effect of  Superstition  make us naturally most obstinate it is therefore no wonder that the Blinded Proselytes of our Few NonJuring Clergy are so hard to be recover'd by the clearest Evidences of Sense and Reason But when a  Principle  is once made truly  Ridiculous  it is not in the Power of Human Nature not to be  asham'd  of it From which Reflection I was first determin'd to attack those  lurking  Enemies of our Constitution from the Stage And though my Success has far exceeded my Expectation yet I grieve when I perhaps with Vanity imagine it might had thrice the  good Effect on the Minds of Your MAJESTY'S People were it not under the  Misfortune  of being written by a  Comedian  I am therefore in some Terror notwithstanding its Publick Applause to reflect how far Your MAJESTY in Your Wisdom may think it proper to withhold Your Pardon for the Unlicensed Boldness of my Undertaking I am sensible it may be justly urg'd against me That even  Truth  and  Loyalty  might have lost their Lustre by appearing reduc'd to want the Defence of so inconsiderable a Champion But as I never believ'd the best Play could be supported in an Ill Cause so was I assur'd the worst might pass with Favour in a Good one And though my Duty and Concern has made me more careful in the Conduct of this than any of my former Endeavours I am convinc'd that what may have been extraordinary in the Success of it is utterly owing to a happy Choice of the Subject And as its meeting no Opposition from our Publick Malecontents seems in some Degree an Argument of the Clear and Honest Truth of those Principles it vindicates so may it of the equal Falshood of the Rebellious and Unchristian Tenets it exposes Nay I have yet a farther Hope that it has even discovered the Strength and Number of the  Misguided  to be much less than may have been artfully infinuated there being no Assembly where People are so free and apt to speak their Minds as in a Crowded  Theatre  Of which Your MAJESTY may have lately seen an Instance in the Insuppressible Acclamations that were given on Your appearing to Honour this Play with Your Royal Presence  BUT were the Disaffected yet as Numerous as some Few may wish them What Honest  Englishman  can ever think them formidable that considers his Security in the Wisdom of Your MAJESTY'S  Counsels  and Your Heroick  Resolution  to Execute them And as every Action of Your Regal Power has shewn the Nation that Your greatest  Glory  and  Delight  is in being the  Father  of Your  People  so may it Convince its Enemies that  they  will always find You KING of Your  Subjects  But I am wandring into Thoughts that awe me into Silence and humbly beg Leave to Subscribe my self  May it please Your  MAJESTY  Your  MAJESTY'S  Most Dutiful and Most Obedient Subject and Servant COLLEY CIBBER  PROLOGUE  Written by N ROWE  Esq  TO Night ye  Whigs  and  Tories  both be safe  Nor hope at one another's Cost to laugh  We mean to souse  Old Satan  and the  Pope  They've no  Relations  here nor  Friends  we hope  A Tool of theirs supplys the Comick Stage  With just Materials for Satyrick Rage  Nor think our Colours may too strongly paint  The Stiff  NonjuringSeparationSaint  Good Breeding ne'er commands us to be Civil  To those who give the Nation to the  Devil  Who at our Surest `Best Foundation strike  And hate our Monarch and  our Church  alike  Our Church  which aw'd with Reverential Fear  Scarcely the Muse presumes to mention here  Long may she these her  worst  of Foes defy  And lift her Mitred Head triumphant to the Sky  While  theirs  but Satyr silently disdains  To name what lives not but in  Madmen's Brains  Like  Bawds  each Lurking  Pastor  seeks the Dark  And fears the  Justice  's Enquiring Clerk  In close Back Rooms his Reuted Flocks he rallys  And reigns the Patriarch of Blind Lanes and Alleys  There safe he lets his thund'ring Censures fly  Unchristens damns us gives our Laws the Lye  And Excommunicates three Storys high  Why since a Land of Liberty they hate  Still will they linger in this Freeborn State  Here every Hour fresh hateful Objects rise  Peace and Prosperity afflict their Eyes  With Anguish Prince and People they survey  Their Just Obedience and his Righteous Sway  Ship off  ye Slaves and seek some passive Land  Where Tyrants after your own Hearts Command  To your  Transalpine  Master's Rule resort  And fill an empty abdicated Court  Turn your Possessions here to  ReadyRhino  And buy ye Lands and Lordships at  Urbino  THE NONJUROR  ACT I  Sir  John Woodvil  and the Colonel  Col  PRAY consider Sir  Sir  John  So I do Sir that I a  er Father and will dispose of her as I please  Col  I don't dispute your Authority Sir but am I am your Son too I think it my Duty to be concern'd for your Honour Have not you countenanced his addresses to my Sister Has not she receiv'd them How then is it possible That either you or she with Honour can recede  Sir  John  Why Sir Suppose I was about buying a Padnag for your Sister and upon Enquiry should find him not sound Pray Sir would there be any great Dishonour in being off o'the Bargain  Col  With Submission Sir I don't take that to be the Case Mr  Heartly  's Birth and Fortune are too well known to you and I dare swear he may desy the World to lay a Blemish upon his Principles  Sir  John  Why then Sir since I must be catechis'd I must tell you I don't like his Principles For I am inform'd he is a Timeserver one that basely flatters the Government and has no more Religion than you have  Col  Sir we don't either of us think it proper to make boast of our Religion but if you please to enquire you will find we go to Church as orderly as the rest of our Neighbours  Sir  John  Ay to what Church  Col  St  James  's ChurchThe establish'd Church  Sir  John  Establish'd Church  Col  Sir  Sir  John  Nay you need not stare Sir and before he values himself upon going to Church I would first have him be sure he is a Christian  Col  A Christian Sir  Sir  John  Ay that's my Question Whether he is yet christned I mean by a Pastor that had a Divine Uninterrupted Successive Right to mark him as a Sheep of the true Fold  Col  Is it possible are you an  Englishman  and offer Sir a Question so uncharitable not only to him but the whole Nation  Sir  John  Nay Sir you may give your self what Air of Amazement you pleaseI won't argue with you you are both of you too harden'd to be converted now but since you thing it your Duty as a Son to be concern'd for my Errors I think it as much mine as a Father to be concern'd for yoursI'll only tell you of them if you think fit to mend themsoif nottake the Consequence  Col  Aside  O give me Temper Heaven this vile nonjuring Zealot what poisonous Principles has he swell'd him withWell Sir since you don't think it proper to argue upon this Subject I'll wave it too But if I may ask it without Offence Are these your only Reasons for discountenancing Mr  Heartly  's Address to my Sister  Sir  John  These are they not flagrant would you have me marry my Daughter to a Pagan for so he is and all of you till you are regularly Christians In short Son expect to inherit no Estate of mine unless you resolve to come into the Pale of the Church of which I prosess my self a Member  Col  I thought I always was Sir and hope I am still unless you have lately been converted to the  Romans  Sir  John  No Sir I abhor the Thoughts on't and Protest against their Errors as much as you do  Col  If so Sir Where's our Difference  Sir  John  Difference 'twould make you tremble Sir to know it but since 'tis fit you should know it look there  Gives him a Book  read that and be reform'd  Col  What's here  Reads  The Case of Schism  c Thank you Sir I have seen enough of this in the  Daily Courant  to be sorry its in any Hands but those of the common Hangman  Sir  John  Prophanation  Col  And though I always honour'd your Concern for the Church's Welfare I little thought 'twas for a Church that is establish'd no where  Sir  John  O Perverseness but there is no better to be expected from your Course of Life This is all the Effects of your modern Loyalty your Conversation at  Button  's Will you never leave that foul Nest of Heresy and Schism  Col  Yes Sir when I see any Thing like it there and should think my self oblig'd to retire where such Principles were startedI own I use the Place because I generally meet there instructive or diverting Company  Sir  John  Yes fine Company indeed  Arians  PartyPoets Players and Presbyterians  Col  That's a very unusual Mixture Sir but if a Man entertains me innocently am I oblig'd to enquire into his Profession or Principles Would not it be ridiculous for a Protestant that loves Musick to refuse going to the  Opera  because most of the Performers are Papists But Sir this seems foreign to my Business Mr  Heartly  intends this Morning to pay his Respects to you in hopes to obtain your final Consent and desired me to be present as a Mediator of Articles between you  Sir  John  I am glad to hear it  Col  That's kind indeed Sir  Sir  John  May be not Sirfor I will not be at home when he comes  Col  Nay pray Sir 'twill be but Civility at least to hear him  Sir  John  And because I won't tell a Lie for the Matter I'll go out this Moment  Col  Good Sir  Sir  John  But because I won't deceive him neither tell him I would not have him lose his Time in fooling after your SisterIn short I have another Man in my Head for her  Exit Sir  John  Col  Another Man 'twould be worth one's while to know himPray Heaven this nonjuring Hypocrite has not got some beggerly Traytor in his Eye for herI must rid the House of him at any rate or all the Settlement I can hope from my Father is a Castle in the Air nor can indeed his Life be safe while such a Villain makes it an Act of Conscience to endanger it If his Eyes are not soon open'd against him the Crown's more likely to inherit his Estate than I am and though the Government has beey very favourable upon those Occasions it is but a melancholly Business to perition for what might have been one  s Birthright My Sister may be ruin'd toohere she comes if there be another Man in the Case she no doubt can let me into the Secret  Enter  Maria  Sister good MorrowI want to speak with you  Mar  Nay but prithee Brother don't put on the wise politick Face then Why you look as if the Minority had like to have carried the Question  Col  Come come a Truce with your Raillery what I have to ask of you is serious and I beg you would be so in your Answer  Mar  Well then provided it is not upon the Subject of Love I will be sobut make Haste toofor I have not had my Tea yet  Col  Why it is and it is not upon that Subject  Mar  O I love a Riddle dearlycomelet's hear it  Col  Nay pishif you will be serious say so  Mar  O Laid' Sir I beg your Pardontherethere's my whole Form and Features totally disengag'd and lifeless at your Service now put them in what Posture of Attention you think fit  She leans against him with her Arms awkardly falling on her Knees  Col  Was there ever such a giddy Devilprithee stand up I have been talking with my Father and he declares positively you shall not receive any farther Addresses from Mr  Heartley  Mar  Are you serious  Col  He said it this Minute and with some Warmth too  Mar  I am glad on't with all my Heart  Col  How glad  Mar  To a Degree Do you think a Man has any more Charms for me for my Father's liking him No Sir if Mr  Heartley  can make his Way to me now he is oblig'd to me only Besides now it may have the Face of an Amour indeed Now one has something to struggle for there's Difficulty there's Danger there's the dear Spirit of Contradiction in it too O I like it mightily  Col  I am glad this does not make you think the worse of  Heartley  but however a Father's Consent might have clapt a pair of Horses more to your Coach perhaps and the want of that may pinch your Fortune  Mar  Burn Fortune Am not I a fine Woman And have not I above  l  in my own Hands  Col  Yes Sister but with all your Charms you have had it in your Hands almost these four Years pray consider that too  Mar  Pshah and have not I had the full Swing of my own Airs and Humours these four Years But if I'll humour my Father I'll warrant he'll make it three or four Thousand more with some unlick'd Lout of a Fellow to drub me into the Bargain A comfortable Equivalent trulyNo no let him light his Pipe with his Consent if he pleases Willful against Wife for a Wager  Col  Well said nothing goes to your Heart I find  Mar  No no Brother the Suits of my Lovers shall not be ended like those at Law by dull Council on both sides I'll hear nothing but what the Plaintiff himself can say to me 'twould be a pretty Thing indeed to confine my Airs to the Directions of a Sollicitor to look kind or cruel only as the Jointure propos'd▪ is or is not equal to the Fortune my Father designs me What do you think I'll have my Features put into the  Gazette  to be dispos'd of like a parcel of dirty Acres by an old Master in Chancery to the fairest Bidder No if I must have an ill Match I'll have the Pleasure of playing my own Game at least  Col  There spoke the Spirit of a freeborn  Englishwoman  Well I am glad you are not startled at the first Part of my News however but fartherPray Sister  has my Father ever propos'd any other Man to you  Mar  Another Man let me know why you ask and I'll tell you  Col  Why the last Words he said to me were That he had another Man in his Head for you  Mar  And who is it Who is it tell me dear Brother quickly  Col  Why you don't so much as seem surpriz'd at it  Mar  No but impatient and that's as well you know  Col  Why how now Sister  Gravely  Mar  Why sure Brother you know very little of Female Happiness if you suppose the Surprize of a new Lover ought to shock a Woman of my Temperdon't you know that I am a  Coquette  Col  If you are you are the first that ever was sincere enough to own her being so  Mar  To a Lover I grant you but I make no more of you than a Sister I can say any Thing to you  Col  I should have been better pleas'd if you had not own'd it to meit's a hateful Character  Mar  Ay it's no Matter for that its violently pleasant and there's no Law against it that I know of You had best advise your Friend  Heartley  to bring in a Bill to prevent it All the discarded Toasts Prudes and superannuated Virgins would give him their Interest I dare swear Take my Word Coquetry has govern'd the World from the Beginning and will do so to the End on't  Col  Heartly  's like to have a hopeful Time on't with you  Mar  Well but don't you really know who it is my Father intends me  Col  Not I really but I imagin'd you might and therefore thought to advise with you about it  Mar  Nay he has not open'd his Lips to me yetAre you sure he's gone out  Col  You are very impatient to know methinks What have you to do to concern your self about any Man but  Heartly  Mar  O Lud O Lud O Lud don't be so wise prithee Brother Why if you had an empty House to lett would you be displeas'd to hear there were two People about it Can any Woman think herself happy that's oblig'd to marry only with a  Hobson  's Choice No don't think to rob me of so innocent a Vanity for believe me Brother there is no Fellow upon Earth how disagreeable  soever but in the long Run of his Addresses will utter something at least that's worth a poor Woman's hearing Besides to be a little serious  Heartly  has a Tincture of Jealousy in his Temper which nothing but a substantial Rival can cure him of  Col  O your Servant Madam now you talk Reason I am glad you are concern'd enough for  Heartly  's Faults to think them worth your mendingHa ha  Mar  Concern'd Why did I say thatlook you I'll deny it all to himWell if ever I am serious with you again  Col  Here he comes be as merry with him as you please  Mar  Pshah  Enter  Heartly Maria  takes a Book from the Table and reads  Hear  Dear Colonel your Servant  Col  I am glad you did not come sooner for in the Humour my Father left me 'twould not have been a proper Time to have press'd your AffairI touch'd upon'tbutI'll tell you more presently in the mean Time lose no Ground with my Sister  Heart  I shall always think my self oblig'd to your Friendship let my Success be what it willMadamyour most obedientWhat have you got there pray  Mar  Repeating  "Her lively Looks a sprightly Mind disclose  "Quick as her Eyes and as unfix'd as those  Hear  Pray Madam What is it  Mar  "Favours to none to all she Smiles extends  Hear  Nay I will see  Strugling  Mar  Putting him by  "Ost she rejectsbut never once offends  Col  Have a Care she has dipt into her own Character and she'll never forgive you if you don't let her through with it  Hear  I beg your Pardon Madam  Gravely  Mar  "Bright as the Sun her Eyes the Gazers strike  "And like the Sun they shine on all alike  umum  Hear  That is something like indeed  Col  You would say so if you knew all  Hear  All what Pray what do you mean  Col  Have a little Patience I'll tell you immediately  Hear  Aside  Confusion some Coxcomb now has been flattering her I'll be curst else she's so full of her dear self upon't  Mar  Turning to  Heartly  "If to her Share some Female Errors fall  "Look on her Faceand you'll forget them all  Is not that natural Mr  Heartly  Hear  For a Woman to expect it is indeed  Mar  And can you blame her when 'tis at the same Time a Proof of the poor Man's Passion and her Power  Hear  So that you think the greatest Compliment a Lover can make his Mistress is to give up his Reason to her  Mar  Certainly For what have your lordly Sex to boast of but your Understanding And till that's entirely surrender'd to her Discretion while the least Sentiment holds out against her a Woman must be downright vain to think her Conquest compleated  Hear  There we differ Madam for in my Opinion nothing but the most excessive Vanity could value or desire such a Conquest  Mar  O d'ye hear him Brother The Creature reasons with me Nay has the frontless Folly to think me in the wrong too O Lud he'd make a horrid Tyrantpositively I won't have him  Hear  Well my Comfort is no other Man will easily know whether you'll have him or not  Mar  Affoctedly smiling  Am not I a horrid vain silly Creature Mr  Heartly  Hear  A little bordering upon the Baby I must own  Mar  Laud how can you love one so then But I don't think you love me thoughdo you  Hear  Yes Faith I do and so shamefully that I am in Hopes you doubt it  Mar  Poor Man he'd fain bring me to Reason  Smiling in his Face  Hear  I would indeed nor am asham'd to own itnay were it but possible to make you serious only when you should be so you would be the most perfect Creature of your Sex  Mar  O Lud he's civil  Hear  Come come you have good Sense use me but with that and make me what you please  Mar  Laud I don't desire to make any thing of you not I  Hear  Don't look so cold upon me by Heaven I can't bear it  Mar  Well now you are tolerable  Gently glancing on him  Hear  Come then be generous and swear at least you'll never be another's  Mar  Ah Lard now you have spoil'd all again beside how can I be sure of that before I have seen this t'other Man my Brother spoke to me of  Reads to her self again  Hear  What Riddle's this  To the Col  Col  I told you you did not know all To be serious▪ my Father went out but now on purpose to avoid you In short he absolutely retracts his Promises says he would not have you fool away your Time after my Sister and in plain Terms told me he had another Man in his Head for her  Hear  Another Man Confusion who what is he did not he name him  Col  No nor has he yet spoke of him to my Sister  Hear  This is unaccountableWhat can have given him this sudden turn  Col  Some Whim our Conscientious Doctor has put in his Head I'll lay my Life  Hear  He He can't be such a Villain he professes a Friendship for me  Col  So much the worse By the way I am now upon the scent of a Secret that I hope shortly will prove him a Rogue to the whole Nation  Hear  You amaze meBut on what Pretence what Ground what Reason what Interest can he have to oppose meThis Shock is insupportable  He stands fix'd and mute  Col  Aside to  Maria  Are you really as unconcern'd now as you seem to be  Mar  Thou art a strange Dunce Brother thou knowest no more of Love than I do of a RegimentYou shall see now how I'll comfort him  She goes to  Heartly  mimicks his Posture and Uneasiness then looks seriously in his Face and blurts into a Laugh  Hear  I don't wonder at your good Humour Madam when you have so substantial an Opportunity to make me uneasy for Life  Mar  O lud how wise he is Well his Reproaches have that greatness of Soulthe Confusion they give one is insupportable  Betty  is the Tea ready  Enter  Betty  Bet  Yes Madam  Mar  Mr  Heartly  your Servant  Exit  Col  So so you have made a fine spot of Work on't indeed  Hear  Dear  Tom  you'll pardon me if I speak a little freely I own the Levity of her Behaviour at this time gives me harder Thoughts than I once believ'd it possible to have of her  Col  Indeed my Friend you mistake her  Hear  O pardon me had she any real Concern for me the Apprehension of a Man's Addresses whom yet she never saw must have alarm'd her to be something more than serious  Col  Not at all for let this Man be who he will I take all this Levity as a Proof of her Resolution to have nothing to say to him  Hear  And pray Sir may I not as well suspect that this artful Delay of her good Nature to me now is meant as a provisional Defence against my Reproaches in case when she has seen this Man she should think it convenient to prefer him to Me  Col  No no she's Giddy but not capable of so serious a Falshood  Hear  It's a sign you don't judge her with a Lover's Eye  Col  No but as a stander by I often see more of the Game than you do Don't you know that she is naturally Coquette And a Coquett's Play with a serious Lover is like a Back game at Tables all open at first she'll make you twenty Blotsand youspare none take them All up to be sure while shegains Points upon you So that when you eagerly expect to end the Game on your Side slapas you were she whips up your Man she's fortified and you are in a worse Condition than when you begun with herUpon which you know of Course you curse your Fortune and she laughs at you  Hear  Faith you judge it rightlyI have always found it so  Col  In short you are in hast to be up and she's resolv'd to make you play out the Game at her leisure you play for the fair Stake and she for Victory  Hear  But still what could she mean by going away so abruptly  Col  You grew too serious for her  Hear  Why who could bear such Trifling  Col  You should have laught at her  Hear  I can't love at that easy rate  Col  NoIf you could the Uneasiness would lie on her Side  Hear  Do you then really think she has any thing in her Heart for me  Col  Ay marry SirAh if you could but get her to own that seriously nowLord how you could love her  Hear  And so I could by Heaven  eagerly embracing him  Col  Ay but 'tis not the Nature of the Creature you must take her upon her own Terms tho' faith I thought she own'd a great deal to you but now Did not you observe when you were impatient with what a conscious Vanity she cry'dNow you are tolerable  Hear  Nay the Devil can be agreeable when she pleases  Col  Well well I'll undertake for her if my Father don't stand in your Way we are well enough and I don't question but the Alarm he has given us like his other Politick Projects will end all  in Fumo  Hear  What says my Lady you don't think she's against us  Col  I dare swear she is not she's of so soft so sweet a Disposition that ev'n Provocation can't make her your Enemy  Hear  How came so fine a Creature to marry your Father with such a vast inequality of Years  Col  Want of Fortune  Frank  She was Poor and Beautiful▪ He Rich and AmorousShe made him Happy and he her  Hear  A Lady  Col  And a JointureNow she's the only one in the Family that has Power with our precise Doctor and I dare engage she'll use it with him to persuade my Father  from any thing that's against your Interest by the way you must know I have some shrewd Suspicions that this sanctify'd Rogue is carnally in love with her  Hear  O the liquorish Rascal  Col  You shall judge by the Symptoms First he's jealous of every Male Thing that comes near her and under a friendly Pretence of guarding my Father's Honour has persuaded him to abolish her Assemblies Nay at the last Masquerade this conscientious Spy unknown to her was eternally at her Elbow in the Habit of a Cardinal At Dinner he never fails to sit next her and will eat nothing but what she helps him always takes her side in Argument and when he bows after Grace constantly Ogles her bids my Sister if she would look lovely learn to Dress by her and at the TeaTable I have seen the impudent Goat most lusciously sip off her leavings She lost one of her Slippers t'other Day by the way she has a mighty pretty Foot and what no you think was become of it  Hear  You puzzel me  Col  I gad this lovesick Monkey had stole it for a private Play Thing and one of the Housemaids when she clean'd his Study found it there with one of her old Gloves in the middle of it  Hear  A very proper Relique to put him in mind of his Devotions to  Venus  Col  But mum here he comes  Enter Doctor  Wolf  and  Charles  Doct  Charles  Step up into my Study and bring down half a Dozen more of those Manual Devotions that I compos'd for the Use of our Friends in Prison and dost thou hear leave this Writing there but bring me the Key and then bid the Butler ring to Prayers  Exit  Charles  Mr  Heartly  I am your most faithful Servant I hope you and the good Colonel will stay and join in the private Duties of the Family  Hear  With all my Heart Sir provided you'll do the Duty of a Subject too and not leave out the Prayer for the Royal Family  Doct  The good Colonel knows I never do omit it  Col  Sometimes Doctor but I don't remember I ever One heard you name them  Doct  That's only to shorten the Service lest in so large a Family some few vain idle Souls might think it Tedious and we ought as it were to Allure them to what's Good by the gentlest easiest Means we can  Hear  How how Doctor Are you sure that's your only Reason for leaving their Names out  Doct  But pray Sir why is Naming them so absolutely necessary when Heaven without it knows the true Intention of our HeartsBeside why should we when we so easily may avoid it give the least colour of Offence to tender Consciences  Col  Ay now you begin to open Doctor  Hear  Have a care Sir the Conscience that Equivocates in its Devotions must have the blackest Colour Hell can paint it with  Col  Well said to him  Heartly  Hear  Your Conscience I dare say won't be easily convinc'd while your Scruples turn to so good Account in a private Family  Doct  What am I to be baited thenbut 'twont be always Holiday  Frowning  The Time's now yours but mine may come  Col  What do you mean Sir  Doct  Sir I shall not explain my self but make your best of what I've said I'm not to be intrap'd by all your servile Spies of PowerBut Power perhaps may change its Hands and you e'er long as little dare to speak your Mind as I do  Col  Taking him by the Collar  Hark you Sirrah Dare you menace the Government in my hearing  Hear  Nay Colonel  Interposing  Doct  'Tis well  Col  Traytor but that our Laws have Chains and Gibbets for such Villains I'd this Moment crackle all thy Bones to Splinters  Shakes him  Doct  Very well your Father Sir shall know my Treatment  Hear  Nay dear Colonel let him go  Col  I ask your Pardon  Frank  I am asham'd that such a Wretch could move me so  Hear  Come compose your self  Doct  Aside and recovering himself  No I'll take no Notice of itI know he's warm and weak enough to tell this as his own Story to his Fatherlet him'tis  better so'twill but confirm Sir  John  in his good Opinion of my Charity and serve to ruin him the faster  Exit  Hear  Was there ever so insolent a Rascal  Col  The Dog will one Day provoke me to beat his Brains out  Hear  Who could have believ'd such outragious Arrogance could have lurk'd under so Lamblike an Outside  Col  This Fellow has the Spleen and Spirit of ten  Beckets  in him  Hear  What the Devil is he whence came he what's his Original Is he really a Doctor  Col  So he pretends and that he lost his Living in  Ireland  upon his refusing the Oaths to the Government Now I have made the strictest Inquiries and can't find the least Evidence that ever he was in the Country But as I hinted to you there is now in Prison a poor unhappy Rebel I went to School with whose Pardon I am solliciting and he assures me he knew him very well in  Flanders  and in such Circumstances as when it can be serviceable to me to know them he faithfully promises to discover but begs till then I will not insist upon it  Hear  I gad this Intelligence may be worth your Cherishing  Col  Hah here's my Sister again  Enter  Maria  hastily Doctor  Wolf  following  Mar  You'll find Sir I will not be us'd thus Nor shall your Credit with my Father protect your Insolence to me  Hear  and  Col  What's the Matter  Mar  Nothing pray be quietI don't want youstand out of the way  They retire  Col  What has the Dog done to her  Mar  How durst you bolt with such Authority in my Chamber without giving me Notice  Hear  Confusion  Col  Now  Frank  whose turn is it to keep their Temper  Apart  Hear  Struggling  'Tis not mine I'm sure  Col  Holdif my Father won't resent this 'tis then time enough for me to do it  Doct  Compose your Transport Madam I came by your Father's Desire who being inform'd that you were Entertaining Mr  Heartly  grew Impatient and gave his Positive

soI have long suspected where his Zeal would end in the making of his private FortuneBut then to found it on the Ruin of his Patron's Children makes me shudder at the Villany What Desperation may a Son be driven to so barbarously disinheritedBeside his Daughter fair  Maria  too is wrong'd wrong'd in the most tender Point For so extravagant is this Settlement it leaves her not a Shilling but on her conditionally marrying with the Doctor's Consent which seems by what I've heard intended as an Expedient to oblige her to accept the Doctor himself for her Husband Now 'twere but an honost part to let  Maria  know this Snare that's laid for her This Deed's not sign'd and might be yet perventedIt shall be so'twere Folly not to tryMy Condition can't be worseWho knows how far her good Nature may

good Breeding he is honest  Mar  He's always clean too  Sir  John  I wonder Daughter when thou wilt take notice of a Man's real MeritHumph well bred and clean forsoothWould not one think now she were describing a Coxcomb  Mar  But dear  Papa  do you make no allowance for one's Taste  Sir  John  Taste hah and One's Taste That Madam One is to me the most provoking impertinent Jade alive and Taste is the true Picture of her senseless sickly Ap  When do you hear my Wife talk at this rate and yet she is as young as your fantastical Ladyship  Lady  W  Maria  's of a cheerful Temper my Dear but I know you don't think she wants Discretion  Sir  John  I shall try that presently and you Sweetheart shall judge between us In short Daughter your Course of Life is but one continual Round of playing the Fool to no purpose and therefore I am resolv'd to make you think seriously and marry  Mar  That I shall do before I marry Sir you may depend upon't  Sir  John  UmThat I am not so sure ofbut you may depend upon my having thought seriously and that's as well For the Person I intend you is of all the World the only Man can make you truly happy  Mar  And of all the World Sir that's the only Man I'll positively marry  Lady  W  Aside to  Mar  Thou hast rare Courage  Maria  If I had such a Game to play I should be frighted out of my Wits  Mar  Lord Madam he'll make nothing on't depend upon it  Aside  Sir  John  Mind what I say to youThis wonderful Man I sayFirst as to his Principles both in Church and State in unquestionable  Mar  Sir I leave all that to you for I should never ask him a Question about either of them  Sir  John  You need not I am fully satisfied of bothHe is a true stanch Member of the  English  Catholick Church  Mar  Methinks though I would not have him a  Roman Catholick  Sir because you know of Double Taxes  Sir  John  No he's no  Roman  Mar  Very well Sir  Sir  John  Then as to the State he'll shortly be one of the most considerable Men in the Kingdom and that too in an Office for Life which on whatsoever pretence of Misbehaviour no Civil Government can deprive him of  Mar  That's fine indeed I was afraid he had been a Cl  rgyman  S  r  J  hn  I have not yet said

GentlemanRakes I suppose that are snapping at every Woman they meet with  Mar  No no Sir I am very well satisfiedII should not care for such a sort of Man no more than I should for one that every Woman was ready to snap at  Sir  John  No you'll be secure from Jealousy he has Experience Ripeness of Years he is almost Forty Nine Your Sexes Vanities will have no Charm for him  Mar  But all this while Sir I don't find that he has any Charm for our Sexes Vanity How does he look Is he tall well made Does he dress sing talk laugh and dance well Has he a good Air good Teeth fine Eyes fine fair PerriwigDoes he keep his Chaise Coach Chariot and Berlin with fix flouncing  Flanders  Does he wear Blew Velvet clean White Stockings and subscribe to the Opera  Sir  John  Was there ever so profligate a Creature What will this Age come to  Lady  W  Nay  Maria  here I must be against youNow you are blind indeed a Woman's Happiness has little to do with the Pleasure her Husband takes in his own Person  Sir  John  Right  Lady  W  'Tis not how he looks but how he loves is the Point  Sir  John  Good again  Lady  W  And a Wife is much more secure that has Charms for her Husband than when the Husband has only Charms for her  Sir  John  Admirable Go on my Dear  Lady  W  Do you think Child a Woman of Five and twenty may not be much happier with an honest Man of Fifty than the finest Woman of Fifty with a young Fellow of Five and twenty  Sir  John  Mark that  Mar  Ay but when two Five and twenties come togetherDear  Papa  you must allow they have a chance to be fifty times as pleasant and frolicksome  Sir  John  Frolicksome why you sensual Ideot What have Frolicks to do with solid Happiness I am asham'd of youGo you talk worse than a Girl at a BoardingSchoolFrolicksome as if Marriage were only a Licence for two People to play the Fool according to Law Methinks Madam you have a better Example of Happiness before your FaceHere's one has ten times your Understanding and she you find has made a different Choice  Mar  Lord Sir how you talk you don't consider Peoples Temper I don't say my Lady is not in the right but then you know  Papa  she's a Prude and I am a Coquet she becomes her Character very well I don't deny it and I hope you see every thing I do is as consistent with mine Your wise Folks may lay down what Rules they please but 'tis Constitution that governs us all and you can no more bring me Sir to endure a Man of Forty nine than you can persuade my Lady to dance in a Church to the Organ  Sir  John  Why you wicked Wretch could any thing persuade you to that  Mar  Lord Sir I won't answer for any thing I should do when the Whim's in my Head You know I always lov'd a little Flirtation  Sir  John  O horrible My poor Mother has ruin'd her leaving her a Fortune in her own hands has turn'd her Brain In short your Sentiments of Life are shameful and I am resolv'd upon your instant Reformation therefore as an Earnest of your Obedience I shall first infist that you never see young  Heartly  more for in one word the good and pious Doctor  Wolf  's the Man that I have decreed your Husband  Mar  Ho ho ho  Laughing aloud  Sir  John  'Tis very wellthis Laugh you think becomes you but I shall spoil your Mirthno moregive me a serious Answer  Mar  Gravely  I ask your Pardon Sir I should not have smil'd indeed could I have suppos'd it possible that you were serious  Sir  John  You'll find me so  Mar  I am sorry for it but I have an Objection to the Doctor Sir that most Fathers think a substantial one  Sir  John  Name it  Mar  Why Sir you know he is not worth a Groat  Sir  John  That's more than you know Madam I am able to give him a better Estate than I am afraid you'll deserve  Mar  How Sir  Sir  John  I have told you what's my Will and shall leave you to think on't  Enter  Charles  Charles  Aside to Sir  John  Sir if you are at leisure the Doctor desires a private Conference with you upon Business of Importance  Sir  John  Where is he  Charles  In his own Chamber Sir just taking his leave of the  Count and another Gentleman that came this Morning Express from  Avignon  He has sent you too the Note you ask'd him for  Sir  John  'Tis well I'll come to him immediately  Ex  Charles  Daughter I am call'd away and therefore have only time to tell you as my last Resolution that if you expect a Shilling from me the Doctor is your Husband or I'm no more your Father  Exit Sir  John  and drops the Paper  Mar  O Madam I am at my Wits end not for the little Fortune I may lose in disobeying my Father but it startles me to find what a dangerous Influence this Fellow has o'er all his Actions  Lady W  Dear  Maria  I am now as much alarm'd as you for though in Compliance to your Father I have been always inclin'd to think charitably of this Doctor yet now I am convinc'd 'tis time to be upon our guardhe's stepping into his Estate too  Mar  Here's my Brother Madam we'll consult with him  To them the Colonel  Col  Madam your most obedientWell Sister is the Secret out Who is this pretty Fellow my Father has pickt up for you  Mar  Ev'n our agreeable Doctor  Col  You are not serious  Lady W  He's the very Man I can assure you Sir  Col  Confusion What would the  Jewish  Cormorant devour the whole Family Your Ladyship knows he is secretly in Love with you too  Lady W  Fy fy Colonel  Col  I ask your Pardon Madam if I speak too freely but I am sure by what I have seen your Ladyship must suspect something of it  Lady W  I am sorry any Body else has seen it but I must own his Civilities of late have been something warmer than I thought became him  Col  How then are these Opposites to be reconcil'd can the Rascal have the Assurance to think both these Points are to be carriedBut he does nothing like other People he's a Contradiction ev'n to his own Character Most of your NonJurors now are generally People of a free and open Disposition mighty Pretenders to a Conscience of Honour indeed But you seldom see them put on the least Shew of Religion But this formal Hypocrite always has it at his Tongue's end and there it sticks for it never gets into his Heart I'll answer for him  Lady W  Ay but that's the Charm that first got him into Sir  John  's Heart who good Man is himself I am sure sincere however now misguided 'twas not so much his Principles of Government as his well painted Piety his seeming Selfdenial Resignation Patience and humble Outside that gave him first so warm a Lodging in his Bosom  Mar  My Lady has judg'd it perfectly right  Col  I am afraid it's too true There has been his surest footing But here we are puzled againWhat subtle Fe  ch can he have in being really in Love with your Ladyship and at the same time making such a Bustle to marry my Sister  Mar  Truly one would not suspect him to be so Termagant I fancy the Gentleman might have his Hands full of one of us  Col  And yet his Zeal pretends to be so shock'd at all indecent Amours that in the Country he us'd to make the Maids lock up the Turkycocks every  Saturday  Night for fear they should gallant the Hens on a  Sunday  Lady W  O Ridiculous  Col  Upon my Life Madam my Sister told me so  Mar  I tell you so You impudent  Lady W  Fy  Maria  he only jests with you  Mar  How can you be such a Monster to be playing the fool here when you have more reason to be frighted out of your Wits You don't know perhaps that my Father declares he'll settle a Fortune upon this Fellow too  Col  What do you mean  Lady W  'Tis too true 'tis not three Minutes since he said so  Col  Nay then 'tis time indeed his Eyes were open'd and give me leave to say Madam 'tis only in your Power to save not only me but ev'n my Father too from Ruin  Lady W  I shall easily come into any thing of that kind that's practicableWhat is't you propose  Col  Why if this Fellow which I am sure of is really in love with you give him a fair Opportunity to declare himself and leave me to make my Advantage of it  Lady W  I apprehend youI am loath to do a wrong thing  Mar  Dear Madam it's the only way in the World to expose him to my Father  Lady W  I'll think of it  Musing  Col  When you do Madam I am sure you will come into it  How now What Paper's this it's the Doctor's Hand  Mar  I believe my Father dropt it  Col  What's here  Reads  Laid out at several times for the Secret Service of His  M       l  s  d  May  the th For six Baskets

cold scented Treason Now Madam I hope you see the Necessity of blowing up this Traitor These are Lengths I did not think my Father had gone with him What vile what low Sedition has he made him stoop to  Lady W  I tremble at the Precipice he stands on  Mar  O bless us I am in a cold Sweat dear Brother leave it where you found it  Lady W  By all means if Sir  John  should know it's in your hands it may make him desperate  Col  You are in the right Madam  He lays down the Paper  Lady W  Let's steal into the next Room and observe that no Body else takes it up he'll certainly come back to look for't  Col  But I must leave you poor  Heartly  stays for me at  White  's and he'll sit upon Thorns 'till I bring him an Account of his new Rival  Mar  Well well get you gone then  Exeunt  Enter Sir  John  in a Hurry  Sir  John  Undone Ruin'd where could I drop this PaperHoldlet's see  He finds it  Ah here it isWhat a blessed Scape was this If my hotbrain'd Son had found it I suppose by tomorrow he would have been begging my Estate for the Discovery  Enter Doctor  Wolf  O Doctor all's well I have found my Paper  Doct  I am sincerely glad of itIt might have ruin'd us  Sir  John  Well Sir what say our last Advices from  Avignon  Doct  All goes rightThe Council has approv'd our Scheme and press mightily for Dispatch among our Friends in  England  Sir  John  But pray Doctor  Doct  Hold Sirnow we are alone give me leave to inform you betterNot that I am vain of any worldly Title but since it has pleas'd our Court to dignify me our Churches Right obliges me to take it  Sir  John  Pray Sir explain  Doct  Our last Express has brought me this  be shews a Writing  which far unworthy as I am promotes me to the vacant See of  Thetford  Sir  John  Is it possible My Lord I joy in your Advancement  Doct  It is indeed a Spiritual Comfort to find my Labours in the Cause are not forgotten though I must own some less conspicuous Instance of their Favour had better suited me Such high Distinctions are invidious and it would really grieve me Sir among my Friends to meet with Envy where I only hope for Love not but I submit in any way to serve them  Sir  John  Ah good Man this Meekness will I hope one Day be rewardedbut pray Sirmy LordI beg your Lordship's Pardonpray what other News how do all our Friends are they in Heart and chearful  Doct  To a Man never in such sanguine hopesthe Court's extremely throng'dnever was there such a concourse of Warlike Exiles though they talk this sharp Season of removing farther into  Italy  for the benefit of milder Air Well The Catholicks are the sincerest Friends  Sir  John  Nay I must do them Justice they are truly Zealous in the Cause and it has often griev'd my Heart that our Churches Differences are so utterly Irreconcileable  Doct  O nourish still that charitable Thought there's something truly Great and Humane in it and really Sir if you examine well the Doctrines laid down by my learned Predecessor in his  Case of Schism  you will find those Differences are not so terribly material as some obstinate Schismaticks would paint them Ah could we but be brought to Temper a great many seeming Contradictions might be reconcil'd on both finds But while the Laity will interpret for themselves there is indeed no doing it Now could we Sir like other Nations but once restrain that monstrous Licence Ah Sir a Union then might soon be practicable  Sir  John  Auh 'twill never do here The  English  are a stubborn heanstrong People and have been so long indulg'd in the use of their own Senses that while they have Eyes in their Heads you will never be able to persuade them they can't see there's no making them give up their Humane Evidences and your  Credo quia impossible est  is an Argument they will always make a Jest of No no it is not Force will do the Thing your Press'd Men don't always make the best Soldiers And truly my Lord we seem to be wrong too in another Point to which I have often imputed the ill Success of our Cause and that is the taking into our Party so may loose Persons of dissolute and abandon'd Morals Fellows whom in their daily private Course of Life the Pillory and Gallows seem to groan for  Doct  'Tis true indeed and I have often wish'd 'twere possible to do without them but in a Multitude all Men won't be all Saints and then again they are really useful nay and in many things that Sober Men will not stoop toThey serve poor Curs to brak at the Government in the open Streets and keep up the wholsome  Spirit of Clamour in the common People and Sir you cannot conceive the wonderful use of Clamour 'tis so teizing to a Ministry it makes them winch and fret and grow uneasy in their PostsAh many a comfortable Point has been gain'd by Clamour 'tis in the Nature of Mankind to yield more to that than ReasonE'en  Socrates  himself could not resist it for wise as he was yet you see his Wife  Xantippe  carried all her Points by Clamour Come come Clamour is a useful Monster and we must feed the hungry Mouths of it it being of the last Importance to us that hope to change the Government to let it have no quiet  Sir  John  Well there is indeed no resisting meer Necessity  Doct  Besides if we suffer our Spirits to cool here at home our Friends obroad will send us over nothing but Excuses  Sir  John  'Tis true but still I am amaz'd that  France  so totally should have left us  Mardyke  they say will certainly be demolish'd  Doct  No matter let them gowe have made a good Exchange our New Ally is yet better as he is less suspectedBut to give them their due we have no Spirits among us like the Women the Ladies have supported our Cause with a surprizing Constancy O there's no daunting them ev'en with ill Success they will starve their very Vanities their Vices to feed their Loyalty I am inform'd that my good Lady Countess of  NightandDay  has never been seen in a new Gown or has once thrown a Die at any of the Assemblies since our last general Contribution  Sir  John  O my good Lord if our Court abroad but knew what Obligations they have to your indefatigable Endeavours  Doct  Alas Sir I can only boast an honest Heart my Power is Weak I only can assist them with my Prayers and zealous Wishes or if I had been serviceable have not you Sir▪ overpaid me Your Daughter Sir the sair  Maria  is a Reward no Merit can pretend to  Sir  John  Nays good my Lord this tender Gratitude confounds meO this insensible GirlPray excuse me  Weeps  Doct  You seem'd concern'd pray what's amiss  Sir  John  That I should be the Father of so blind a Child alas she slights the Blessing I propos'd she sees you not my Lord with my fond Eyes but lay not I beseech you  at my Door the ungrateful Stubbornness of a thoughtless Girl  Doct  Nay good Sir he not thus concern'd for me we must allow her Female Modesty a time your strict Commands perhaps too suddenly surpriz'd her Maids must be slowly gently dealt with and might I Sir presume to advise  Sir  John  Any thing your Will shall govern me and her  Doct  Then Sir abate of your Authority and let the Matter rest a while Suppose I first should beg your good Lady Sir to be my Friend to her Women will hear from their own Sex what sometimes ev'n from the Man they like would startle them May I have your Permission Sir when Dinner is remov'd to entertain my Lady on this Subject privately  Sir  John  O by all means and troth it is an excellent Thought I'll go this Instant and prepare her to receive you and will myself contrive your Opportunity  Doct  You are too good to me Sirtoo bountiful  Sir  John  Nay now my Lord you drive me from you  Doct  Pray pardon me  Sir  John  No more I beg you good my Lordyour Servant  Exit  Doct  Ha ha What noble Harvests have been reaped from bigotted Credulity nor ever was a better Instance of it Would it not make one Smile that it should ever enter into the Brains of this Man who can in other Points distinguish like a Man that a Protestant Church can never be secure till it has a Popish Prince to defend it  Enter  Charles  So  Charles  hast thou finish'd those Letters  Charles  I have brought them Sir  D  ct  'Tis very well let them be seal'd without a Direction and give them to  Aaron Sham  the Jew when he calls for themO andhere step yourself this Afternoon to Mr  Deseazance  of  Gray's Inn  and give him this Thirty Pound Bill from Sir  Harry Foxbound  beg him to sit up Night and Day till the Writings are finish'd For his Trial certainly comes on this Week he knows we can't always be sure of a Jury and a Moment's Delay may make the Commissioners lay hold of his Estate  Charles  My Lord I'll take the utmost Care  Doct  Well  Charles  Gravely smiling  Charles  Sir  John  has told me of the new Duty I ought to pay when in private  Doct  But take special heed that it be only private  Charles  Your Lordship need not caution meMy Lord I hear another Whisper in the Family I'm told you'll shortly be allied to it Sir  John  they say has actually consented I hope my Lord you'll find the fair  Maria  too as yelding  Doct  Such a Proposal has indeed been started but it will end in nothing  Maria  is a giddy wanton thing not form'd to make a wise Man happy her Life's too vain too sensual to elevate a Heart like mine No no I have Views more serious  Charles  O my fluttering Joy  Aside  Doct  Marriage is a State too turbulent for me  Charles  But with Sir  John  's Consent my Lord her Fortune may be considerable  Doct  Thou know'st  Charles  my Thoughts of Happiness were never form'd on Fortune  Charles  No I find that by the Settlement  Aside  Doct  Or if they were they would be there impossible  Maria  's vain distaste of me I know's as deeply rooted as my Contempt of her And canst thou think I'd stain my Character to be a Wanton's Mokery to follow through the Wilds of Folly she would lead me to cringe and doat upon a senseless Toy that every Feather in a Hat can purchase  Charles  But mayn't Sir  John  take it ill my Lord to have her slighted  Doct  No no her ridiculous Aversion will secure me from his Reproaches  Enter a Servant  Serv  Sir my Master desires to speak with you  Doct  I'll wait on him  Charles  you'll take care of my Directions  Charles  I'll be sure Sir  Exit Doctor  Kind Heaven I thank thee this Bar so unexpectly remov'd gives vigour to my Heart and is I hope an Omen of its FortuneBut I must lose no Time the Writing may be every Moment called forthis is her Chamber  He knocks softlyand  Betty  Enters to him  Is your Lady busy  Bett  I think she's only a reading  Charles  Will you do me the Favour to let her know if she is at leisure I beg to speak with her upon some earnest Business  Maria  Enter with a Book  Mar  Who's that  Bett  She's hereMr  Charles  Madam desires to speak with you  Mar  O Your Servant Mr  Charles  Here take this odious  Homer  and lay him up again he tires me  Exit  Betty  with the Book  How could the blind Wretch make such a horrid fuss about a fine Woman for so many Volumes together and give us no Account of her Amours You have read him I suppose in the  Greek  Mr  Charles  Charles  Not lately Madam  Mar  But do you so violently admire him now  Charles  The Criticks say he has his Beauties Madam But  Ovid  has been always my Favorite  Mar  Ovid  O he's ravishing  Charles  And so art thou to Madness  Aside  Mar  Lord how could one do to learn  Greek  was you a great while about it  Charles  It has been half the Business of my Life Madam  Mar  That's cruel now then you think one can't be Mistress of it in a Month ar two  Charles  Not easily Madam  Mar  They tell me it has he softest Tone for Love of any Language in the World I fancy I could soon learn itI know two Words of it already  Charles  Pray Madam what are they  Mar  Stay let me seeOay  Zoe kai Psyehe  Charles  I hope you know the  English  of 'em Madam  Mar  O lud I hope there's no Harm in it I am sure I heard the Doctor say it to my LadyPray what is it  Charles  You must first imagine Madam a tender Lover gazing on his Mistress and then indeed they have a softness in 'em as thus  Zoe kai psyche  my Life my Soul  Mar  O the Impudent young Rogue how his Eyes spoke too  Aside  What the duce can he want with me  Charles  I have startled her she muses  Aside  Mar  It always ran in my Head this Fellow had something in him above his ConditionI'll know presently  Aside  Well but your Business with me Mr  Charles  you have something of Love in your Head now Ill lay my Life on't  Charles  I never yet durst own it Madam  Mar  Why what's the Matter  Charles  My Story is too Melancholy to entertain a Mind so much at Ease as yours  Mar  O I love melancholy Stories of all things  Charles  But mine Madam can't be told unless I give my Life into your Power  Mar  O Lud you have not done any Body a Mischief I hope  Charles  I never did a private Injury if I have done a publick Wrong I'm sure it might in me at least be called an honest Error  Mar  Pray whom did you serve before you liv'd with the Doctor  Charles  I was not born to serve and had not an unfortunate Education ruin'd me might have now appear'd like what I am by Birth a Gentleman  Mar  I am surpriz'd Your Education say you ruin you Lord I am concern'd for you Pray let me know your Story and if any Services are in my Power I am sure you may command them  Charles  Such soft Compassion from so fair a Bosom o'erpays the word than can attend my owning what I am  Mar  O your Servantbut pray let's hear  Charles  My Father's elder Brother Madam was a Gentleman of an antient Family in the North who having then no Child himself begg'd me from my Nurse's Arms to be adopted as his own with an Assurance too of making me his Heir to which my Father then alas in the Infancy of his Fortune easily consented This Uncle being himself secretly disaffected to the Government gave me of course in my Education the same unhappy Prejudices which since have ended in the Ruin of us both  Mar  Then you were bred a  RomanCatholick  Charles  No Madam but I own in Principles of very little difference which I imbib'd chiefly from this Doctor he having been five Years my Governor As I grew up my Father'sMerit had rais'd his Fortune under the present Government and fearing I might be too far fix'd in Principles against it desired me from my Uncle Home again But I as I then thought my self bound in Gratitude excus'd my going in Terms of Duty to my Father whom since alas I too justly have provok'd ever to hope a Reconciliation I saw too late my Folly and had no Defence against his  Anger but by artfully confirming him in a Belief that I had perish'd with my Uncle in the late Rebellion  Mar  Bless us what do you mean you were not actully in it I hope  Charles  I can't disown the Guiltbut since the Royal Mercy has been refus'd to none that frankly have confess'd with Penitence their Crime which from my Heart I most sincerely do in that is all my HopeMy Youth and Education's all th' Excuse I plead if they deserve no Pity I am determin'd to throw off my Disguise and bow me to the Hand of Justice  Mar  Poor Creature Lord I can't bear it  with Concern  Charles  But then unknown and friendless as I am to whom alas can I apply for Succour  Weeps  Mar  O Lord I'll serve you depend upon it My Brother shall have no rest 'till he gets your Pardon  Charles  Your kind Compassion Madam has prevented what if I durst I should have mention'd I hope too I shall personally deserve his Favour if not your generous Inclination to have sav'd me even in my

into the Rebellion  Charles  This Doctor Madam who as he is now your Father's was then my Uncle's BosomCounsellor 'Twas his infidious Tongue that painted it to us as an incumbent Duty on which the Welfare of our Souls depended he warm'd us too into such a weak Belief of vile Reports as Infamy should blush to mentionwe were assur'd that half the Churches here in Town were lying all in

 Heartly  and therefore resolves to give you  Maria  Now pray be sincere and let me know what your real Intentions are  Doct  Is it possible Can you Divine Perfection be still a Stranger to my real Thoughts Has not one Action of my Life inform'd you better Since I must plainly speak them then  Maria  's but a Feint a Blind to screen my real Thoughts from shrewd Suspicion's Eye and shield your spotless Fame from worldly Censure Could you then think 'twas for  Maria  's sake your Balls Assemblies and your Toilet Visits have been restrain'd Would I have urged Sir  John  to make that Fence to

other Mens of sensual Flesh and Blood and has its Frailties  Lady W  We all have those but yours I know are well corrected by your divine and virtuous Contemplations  Doct  And yet our Knowledge of Eternal Beauties do not restrain us wholly from the love of all that's mortalBeauty here 'tis true must die but while it lives 'twas given us to admire to wake the sluggish Heart and charm the

you blame me then for following so sure a Guide in the same youthful Path to Happiness  Lady W  Is this your Resolution then  Col  Will you let him go on Sir  Sir  John  Yes Sir to confound your Slander  Apart  Col  Monstrous  Doct  Can you suppose my Heart less capable of Love than his Is it for me to push the Blessing from me too For tho' my Flame has been of long Duration my conscious want

End of the Third ACT  ACT IV  Maria  and  Charles  Mar  YOU were a Witness then  Charles  I saw it sign'd seal'd and deliver'd Madam  Mar  And all pass'd without the least Suspicion  Charles  Sir  John  sign'd it with such Earnestness and the Doctor receiv'd it with such a seeming Reluctance that neither had the Curiosity to examine a Line of it  Mar  Well Mr  Charles  whether it succeeds to our Ends or not we have still the same Obligations to you You saw with what a friendly Warmth my Brother heard your Story and I don't in the least doubt his Success in your Affair at Court  Charles  What I have done my Duty bound me to But pray Madam give me leave without Offence to ask you one innocent Question  Mar  Freely Sir  Charles  Have you never suspected then that in all this Affair I have had some secret stronger Motive to it than barely Duty  Mar  Yesbut have you been in no Apprehensions I should discover that Motive  Gravely  Charles  Pray pardon me I see already I have gone too far  Mar  Not at all it loses you no Merit with me nor is it in my Nature to use any one ill that loves me unless I lov'd that one again then indeed there might be DangerCome don't look grave my Inclinations to another shall not hinder me paying every One what's due to their Merit I shall therefore always think my self oblig'd to treat your Misfortunes and your Modesty with the utmost Tenderness  Charles  By the dear soft Ease you have given my Heart I never hoped for more  Mar  Then I'll give you a great deal more and to shew my particular good Opinion of you I'll do you a Favour Mr  Charles  I never did any Man since I was bornI'll be sincere with you  Charles  Is it then possible you can have lov'd another to whom you never were sincere  Mar  Alas you are but a Novice in the PassionSincerity is a dangerous Virtue and often surfeits what it ought to nourish therefore I take more Pains to make the Man I love believe I slight him than if possible I would to convince you of my Esteem and Friendship  Charles  Be but sincere in that Madam and I can't complain  Mar  Nay I'll give you a Proof of it I'll shew you all the Goodnature you can desire you shall make what Love to me you please now but then I'll tell you the Consequence I shall certainly be pleas'd with it and that will flatter you till I do you a Mischief Now do you think me sincere  Charles  I scarce consider that but I'm sure you are agreeable  Mar  Why look you there now do you consider that a Woman had as live be thought agreeable as handsome And how can you suppose from one of your Sense that I am not pleas'd with being told so  Charles  Was ever Temper so enchanting  Mar  Or Vanity more venial I'm pleas'd with you  Smiling  Charles  Distracting sure never was Despair administred with a Hand so gentle  Mar  So now you have convinc'd me I have a good Understanding tooWhy I shall certainly have the better Opinion of yours for finding it out now  Charles  Your good Opinion's what I aim at  Mar  Ay but the more I give it you the better you'll think of me still and then I must think the better of you again and then you the better of me upon that too and so at last I shall think seriously and you'll begin to think ill of me But I hope Mr  Charles  your good Sense will prevent all this  Charles  I see my Folly now and blush at my Presumption but yet to cure my weaning Heart and reconcile me to my Doom be yet sincere and satisfy one sickly Longing of my Soul  Mar  To my Power command me  Charles  O tell me then the Requisites I want and what's the secret Charm that has preferr'd my Rival to your Heart  Mar  Come then be chearful and I'll answer like a Friend The Gentleness and Modesty of your Temper would make with mine but an unequal Mixture with  you I shou'd be ungovernable not know my self your Compliance would undo me I am by Nature Vain Thoughtless Wild and Wilful therefore ask a higher Spirit to controul and lead me For whatever outward Airs I give my self I am within convinc'd a Woman makes a very wrong Figure in Happiness that does not think Superiority best becomes her HusbandBut what's yet more tho' I confess you have Qualities uncommon in your Sex and such as ought to warm a Heart to love yet here you come too late Compassion's all within my Power And I know you cannot but have seen I am under Obligations I need not explain to you  Charles  I am satisfiedYou treat me with so kind and gentle a Concern that I must submit to it  Mar  Apart  Well when all's done he's a pretty Fellow and the first sure that ever heard Reason against himself with so good an Understanding  Enter a Servant with a Letter to  Charles  Serv  Sir the  Colonel  order'd me to give this into your own Hands  Mar  From my BrotherWhere is he  Serv  I left him Madam at the  Secretary  's  Office  with one Sir  Charles Trueman  and Mr  Heartly  Exit  Serv  Charles  Ha my Father O Heaven 'tis his Hand too Now I tremble  Mar  Come Sir take heart I dare say there's good News in't and I should be glad to hear itBut no Ceremony pray read to your self first  Charles  Since you command me Madam  Reads to himself  Maria  Apart  Lord how one may live and learn I could not have believ'd that Modesty in a young Fellow could have been so amiable a Virtue and though I own there is I know not what of dear Delight in indulging one's Vanity with them yet upon serious Reflection we must confess that Truth and Sincerity have a Thousand Charms beyond it And I now find more Pleasure in my selfdenying Endeavours to make this poor Creature easy than ever I took in humbling the Airs and Assurance of a Man of QualityI believe I had as good confess all this to  Heartly  and ev'n make up the Bustle with him tooBut then he will so teaze one for Instances of real InclinationO GodI can't bear the Thought on'tAnd yet we must come together tooWell Nature knows the way to be sure and so I'll ev'n trust to her sor'tBless me What's the Matter you seem concern'd Sir  To  Charles  wiping his Tears  Charles  I am indeed but 'tis with Joy O Madam my Father's reconcil'd to me This Letter is from him  Mar  Pray let's hear  Charles  Reading  Dear  Charles  This Day by Colonel  Woodvil  I receiv'd the joyful News of your being yet alive and well Though that's but half my Comfort He has assur'd me too you have renounc'd those Principles that made me think your Death my Happiness The Services you have intended his Family and may do the Government in your just Detection of a Traytor that would ruin both have been so well receiv'd at Court and so generously represented there by the  Colonel  and Mr  Heartly  that they have obtain'd an Order for your Pardon which I now stay the passing of before I throw my Arms about you that I may have no Doubt or Fear behind to interupt the Fulness of my Joy I am inform'd that in revealing your self to a certain fair Lady you have let fall some Words that shew you have an innocent tho' hopeless Passion for her Your Youth excuses what is past but now consider how far you owe your Life to Mr  Heartly  I therefore charge you on my Blessing to give up every idle Thought of Love that may interrupt his Happiness or abate the Merit of what you've done to deserve the Pardon of your Sovereign or of your affectionate forgiving Father  Charles Trueman  Mar  I an overjoy'd at your good Fortune  Charles  You Madam are the Scource of allbut I am now unfit to thank you  Weeps  Mar  You owe me nothing Sir Success was all I hoped for  Charles  Pray excuse meIt would be Rudeness to trouble you with the tender Thoughts this must give a Heart oblig'd like mine  Exit  Charles  Mar  Poor Creature how full his honest Heart is What early Vicissitudes of Fortune has he run through Well this was handsomely done of  Heartly  considering what he had felt upon his Account to be so concern'd for his Pardon  Enter  Lady Woodvil  Lady W  Dear  Maria  what will become of us The Tyranny of this subtle Priest is insupportable He has so fortified himself in Sir  John  's Opinion by this last Misconduct of your Brother that I begin to lose my usual Power with him  Mar  Pray explain Madam  Lady W  In spight of all I cou'd urge he is this Minute bringing the Doctor to make his Addresses to you  Mar  I am glad on't for the Best must come like a Bear to the Stake I'm sure He knows I shall bait him  Lady W  No no he presses it to keep Sir  John  still blind to his wicked Design upon meTherefore I came to give you notice that you might be prepar'd to receive him  Mar  I am oblig'd to your Ladyship Our Meeting will be a tender Scene no doubt on't  Lady W  You have heard I suppose what an extravagant Settlement your Father has sign'd to  Mar  Yes Madam but I am glad your Ladyship's like to be a Gainer by it however For when I marry it will be without the Doctor's Consent depend upon't  Lady W  No Child I did not come into Sir  John  's Family with a Design to injure it or make any one of it my Enemy Whenever that Four Thousand Pound falls into my Hands you'll find it as firmly yours as if it had been given you without that odious Condition  Mar  Madam I think my self as much oblig'd by this kind Intention as the Performance But if your Ladyship could yet find a way to prove this Hypocrite a private Villain to my Father I am not without Hopes the Publick will soon have enough against him to give a Turn to the Settlement  Lady W  But suppose that fails what will become of your poor Brother  Mar  But dear Madam I cannot suppose this Fellow must not be hang'd at last and then you know the same honest Hand that ties him up releases the Settlement  Lady W  Not absolutely neither for this very House is given him in present which tho' that were to be the End of him would then be sorfeited  Mar  Why then my Brother must ev'n petition the Government There have been Presidents of the same Favour Madam If not he must pay for his Blundering and lay his next Plot deeper I think  Lady W  I am glad you are so chearful upon it however it looks as if you had something  in Petto  to depend upon But here comes the Doctor  Enter Sir  John  with the  Doctor  Sir  John  Daughter since you have the Happiness to be thought Amiable in the Eye of this Good Man I expect you  give him an instant Opportunity to improve it into an Amity for Life  Mar  I hope Sir I shall give him no Occasion to alter his Opinion of me  Sir  John  Why that's well said come Sweetheart we'll use no Ceremony  Exit Sir  John  with  Lady W Marra  and the  Doctor  stand some Time mute in formal Civilities and a conscious Contempt of each other  Mar  Please to sit SirWhat can the ugly Cur say to me He seems a little puzzled This puts me in mind of the tender Interview between Lady  Charlotte  and Lord  Hardy  in the Funeral  Aside  Doct  Look you fair Lady not to make many Words I am convinc'd notwithstanding your good Father's Favour I am not the Person you desire to be alone with upon this Occasion  Mar  Your Modestyis pleas'd to be in the right Sir  Doct  Humh if I don't flatter my self you have always had a very ill Opinion of me  Mar  A worse Sir of no Mortal breathing  Doct  Humh and it is likely it may he immoveable  Mar  No Rock so firm  Doct  Humh from these Premises then I may reasonably concludeyou hate me heartily  Mar  Most sincerely Sir  Doct  Well there is however some Merit in speaking Truth therefore to be as just on my side I ought in Conscience to let you know that I have as cordial a Contempt for you too  Mar  O fy you flatter me  Affecting a Blush  Doct  Indeed I don't you wrong your own Imperfections to think so  Mar  These Words from any Tongue but yours might shock me but coming from the only Man I hatethey charm me  Doct  Admirable there seems good Sense in this Have you never observ'd Madam that sometimes the greatest Discords raise the most agreeable Harmony  Mar  Yes But what do you infer from thence  Doct  That while we still preserve this Temper in our Hate a mutual Benefit may rise from it  Mar  O never fear me Sir I shall not fly out being convinc'd that nothing gives so sharp a Point to one's A version as good Breeding as on the contrary ill Manners often hide a secret Inclination  Doct  Most accurately distinguish'dWell Madam is there no Project you can think of now to turn this mutual A version as I said into a mutual Benefit  Mar  None that I know of unless we were to marry for our mutual Mortification  Doct  What would you give then to avoid marrying me  Mar  My Life with Joy if Death alone cou'd shun you  Doct  When you marry any other Personmy Consent is necessary  Mar  So I hear indeedBut pray  Doctor  tell me how could your Modesty receive so insolent a Power without putting my poor Father out of Countenance with your Blushes  Doct  You overrate my Prudence I sought it not but he would crowd it in among other Obligations He is goodnatur'd and I could not shock him by a Refusal Wou'd you have had me plainly told him what a despicable Opinion I had of his Daughter  Mar  Or rather what a favourable one you had of his Wife Sir  Doct  Humh you seem to lose your Temper  Mar  Why do you suppose the whole Family does not see it except my Father  Doct  If you will keep your Temper I have something to propose to you  Mar  Your Reproof is just but I only rais'd my Voice to let you know I know you  Doct  You might have spar'd your Pains it being of no Consequence to my Proposal what you think of me  Mar  Not unlikely Come Sir I am ready to receive it  Doct  In one Word thenI take it for granted that you would marry Mr  Heartly  Am I right  Mar  Once in your Life you are  Doct  Nay no Compliments let us be plainWould you marry him  Mar  You are mighty nice methinksWellI would  Doct  Then I won't consent to itNow if you have any Proposal to make mesoif not our Amour's at an end and we part as Civil Enemies as if he had been married this TwelvemonthThink of it  Mar  Aside  O the mercenary Villain he wants to have a Fellow feeling I findWhat shall I do with himbite himpretend to comply and make my Advantage of itWell Sir I understand every thing but the Sumif we agree upon that it's a Bargain  Doct  Half  Mar  What Two Thousand Pound for your Consent only  Doct  Why is not Two Thousand Pound worth Two Thousand Pound Don't you actually get so much by it Is not the half better than nothing Come come say I have us'd you like a Friend  Mar  Nay I think it's the only civil Thing you have done since you came into the Family  Doct  Do you then make your Advantage of it  Mar  Why as you say  Doctor  'tis better than nothing But how is my Father to be brought into this  Doct  Leave that to my Management  Mar  What Security tho' do you expect for this Money  Doct  O when I deliver my Consent in Writing  Heartly  shall lay it me down in  Bank  Bills  Mar  Well on one Proviso I'll undertake that too  Doct  Name it  Mar  Upon your immediately owning to my Father that you are willing to give up your Interest to Mr  Heartly  Doct  Humh stayI agree to ityou shall have Proof of it this EveningBut in the mean time let me warm you too Don't expect after I have hinted what you desire to your Father to make your Advantages now by betraying me to him You know my Power there if you do I can easily give it a CounterTurn So discover what you please I shall only pity you  Mar  O I shall not stand in my own Light I know your Power and your Conscience too well dear  Doctor  Doct  Nay I dare depend upon your being true to your own Interest Here comes your Father I will break it to him immediately You'll prepare Mr  Heartly  in the mean time  Mar  Without fail  Doct  I am satisfied  Enter Sir  John  Sir  John  Well Sir is my Daughter prudent Has she at last a true and virtuous Sense of Happiness  Doct  She understands me better than I hoped Sir  Mar  Well said Equivocation  Aside  Doct  If you please Sir  John  we'll take a Turn in the Garden I have something there to offer to you  Sir  John  With all my Heart Sir  Maria  There's a Toy for theeNow thou art again my Daughter  Gives her a Ring  Come Sir I wait on you  Exeunt  Sir  John  and  Doctor  Mar  What this Fellow's Original was I know not but by his Conscience and Cunning he would make an admirable JesuitHere comes my Brother and I hope with a good Account of himWell Brother What Success  Enter  Colonel  Col  All that my honest Heart could wish forSubstantial Affidavits that will puzzle him to Answer I have planted a Messenger at the next Door who has a Warrant in his Pocket when I give the Word to take him  Mar  Why should not you do it immediately he's now in the Garden with my Father  Col  No our seizing him now for Treason I am afraid won't convince my Father of his Villany My Design is not only to get my Father out of his Hands but to drive the pernicious Principles he has instill'd out of my Father too  Mar  That I doubt will be difficult  Col  Not at all if we can first prove him a private Villain to him My Father's Honesty will soon reflect and may receive as sudden a Turn as his Credulity  Mar  That's true again and I hope I am furnish'd with a new Occasion to begin the Alarm to him  Col  Pray what is't  Mar  Not to trouble you with Particulars but in short I have agreed with the  Doctor  that  Heartly  shall give him Two Thousand Pounds for his Consent without which you know by my Father's late Settlement  Heartly  and I can never come together  Col  And does the Monster really insist upon't  Mar  Not only that but ev'n defies me to make an Advantage of the Discovery  Col  One would think the Villain suspects his Footing in the Family is but shortliv'd he is in such Haste to have his Pennyworths out on't But prithee Sister What Secret's this that you have yet behind in those Writings that  Charles  brought to you  Mar  O that's what I can't yet tell you  Col  Why pray  Mar  Because when you have done all you can I am resolv'd to reserve some Merit against him to my self  Col  But why do you suppose I would not assist in it  Mar  You can't it's now too late  Col  Pshah this is rash and ridiculous  Mar  Ay may be so I suppose  Heartly  will be of that Opinion too But if he is you had better advise him to keep it to himself  Col  You will have your obstinate Way I find  Mar  It can't be worse than yours I'm sure remember how you came off in your last Project I know you meant well but you are disinherited for all that  Col  That's no Surprize to me but I am asham'd however  Mar  By the way What have you done with  Heartly  why is he not here  Col  He has been here but you must excuse him he was obliged to call in Haste for  Charles  whom he took home with him in his own Coach where his Father waited to receive him  Mar  The poor Boy by this Time then has seen him Sure their meeting must have been a moving Sight I would give the World methinks for a true Account of it  Col  You'll have it from  Heartly  by and by 'tis at his House they meet The Father Sir  Charles Trueman  hapned to be  Heartly  's intimate Acquaintance  Mar  Well I own  Heartly  has gained upon me by this  Col  I am glad to hear that at least But I must let my Lady know what Progress we have made in the  Doctor's  Business and beg her Assistance to finish him  Ex  Col  Enter a Servant  Ser  Madam Mr  Heartly  Mar  Desire him to walk in  Enter  Heartly  Hear  To find you thus alone Madam was an Happiness I did not expect from the Temper of our last parting  Mar  I should have been as well pleas'd now to have been thank'd as reproach'd for my good Nature but you will be in the Right I find  Hear  Indeed you took me wrong I literally meant that I was afraid you would not so soon think I had deserv'd this Favour  Mar  Well then one of us has been in the Wrong at least  Hear  'Twas I I own itMore is not in my Power all the Amends that have been I have made you My very Joy of seeing you has waited till what you had at Heart unask'd was perfected my own Pardon was postpon'd till I had secur'd one ev'n for a Rival's Life whom you so justly had compassionated  Mar  Pooh but why would you say  unask'd  now Don't you consider your doing it so is half the Merit of the ActionLord you have no Art you should have left me to have taken Notice of that only imagine now how kind and handsome an Acknowledgment you have robb'd me of  Heart  And yet how artfully you have paid it With what a wanton charming Ease you play upon my Tenderness  Mar  Well but was not you silly now  Hear  Gazing on her  ComeYou shall not be seriousYou can't be more agreeable  Mar  O but I am serious  Hear  Then I'll be soDo you forgive me all  Mar  What  Looking on her Fan as not hearing him  Hear  Are we Friends  Maria  Mar  O Lord but you have told me nothing of poor  Charles  Pray how did his Father receive him  Hear  Must you needs know that before you answer me  Mar  Lord you are never well till you have talk'd one out of Countenance  Hear  Come I won't be too particular you shall answer nothingGive me but your Hand only  Mar  Pshah I won't pull off my Glove not I  Hear  I'll take it as it is then  Mar  Lord there there eat it eat it  Putting it awkwardly to him  Hear  And so I could by Heav'n  Kisses  eagerly and pulls off her Glove  Mar  O my Glove my Glove my GlovePooh you are in a perfect Storm Lord if you make such a Rout with ones Hand only What would you do if you had ones Heart  Hear  That's impossible to tellBut you were asking me of  Charles  Madam  Mar  O ay that's true Well now you are good againCome tell me all that Affair and then you shall seehow I will like you  Wantonly  Hear  O that I could thus play with Inclination  Mar  Pshah but you don't tell me now  Hear  There is not much to tellWhere two such tender Passions met Words had but faintly spoke them The Son conducted to the Door with sudden Fear stopt short and bursting into Sights o'er chang'd with Shame and Joy had almost fainted in my Arms The Father touch'd with his Concern mov'd forward with a kindly Smile to meet him At this he took new Life and springing from his Hold fell protestate at his Feet where mute and trembling for a while he lay At length with streaming Eyes and faultring Tongue he begg'd his Blessing and his Pardon The tender Father caught him in his Arms and dropping his fond Head upon his Cheek kiss'd him and sigh'd out  Heaven protect thee  then gave into his hand the Royal Pardon and turning back his Face to dry his Manly Eyes he cry'd  Deserve this Royal Mercy  Charles  and I am still thy Father  The grateful Youth raising his Heartswollen Voice reply'd  May Heaven preserve the Royal Life that gave it  But here their Passions grew too strong for farther Speech Silent Embraces alternate Sighs and mingling Tears were all their Language now The moving Scene became too tender for my Eyes and call'd methought for Privacy there unperceiv'd I left them to recover into breathing Sense and utterable Joy  Mar  Well of all the inmost Transports of the Soul there's none that dance into the Heart like Friendly Reconcilements  Hear  Those Transports might be ours  Maria  would you bu  try your Power to pardon  Mar  Which of those Two now do you think was happiest at that Meeting  Hear  O the Father doubtless Great Souls feel a kind of honest Glory in Forgiving that far exce  ds the Transport of receiving Pardon  Mar  Now I think to bend the stubborn Mind to ask it is an equal Conquest and the Joy superior to receive where the Heart wishes to be under Obligations  Hear  Put me into the happy Boy's Condition and I may then perhaps resolve you better  Mar  You shall positively bring him into Acquaintance  Hear  Upon my Word I will  Mar  And shew him to all the Women of Taste and I'll have you call him my pretty Fellow too  Hear  I will indeed But hear me  Mar  I'm positive if he had White Stockings he would cut down all the Danglers at Court in a Fortnight  Hear  O no doubt on't but  Mar  You can't conceive how prettily he makes Love now  Hear  Not so well as you make your Defence  Maria  Mar  O Lord I had forgothe's to teach me  Greek  too  Hear  O the trifling Tyrant How long  Maria  do you think you can find out new Evasions for what I say unto you  Mar  Lord you are horrid silly But since 'tis Love that makes you such a Duncepoor  Heartly  I forgive you  Enter  Colonel  unseen  Hear  That's kind howeverBut to compleat my Joy be kinder yetand  Mar  O I can't I can'tLord did you never ride a HorseMatch  Hear  Was ever so wild a Question  Mar  Because if you have it runs in my Head you certainly gallop'd a Mile beyond the Winning Post to make sure on't  Hear  Now I understand you But since you will have me touch every Thing so very tenderly  Maria  How shall I find proper Words to ask you the Lover's last necessary Question  Mar  O there's a Thousand Points to be adjusted before that's answer'd  Col  Coming unexpectedly between them  Name them this Moment then for positively this is the last Time of asking  Mar  Pshah Who sent for you  Col  I only came to teach you to speak plain  English  my Dear  Mar  Lord mind your own Business can't you  Col  So I will for I will make you do more of yours in Two Minutes than you would have done without me in a Twelvemonth Why how now What do you think the Man's to dangle after your ridiculous Airs for ever  Mar  This is mighty pretty  Col  You'll say so on  Thursday  Sevenight for let Affairs take what Turn they will in the Family that's positively your Wedding DayNay you shan't stir  Mar  Was ever such Assurance  Hear  Upon my Life Madam I am out of Countenance I don't know how to behave my self to him  Mar  No no let him go on onlyThis is beyond whatever was known sure  Hear  Admirable I hope it will come to something  Aside  Col  Ha ha If I were to leave you to yourselves now what a Couple of pretty out of Countenance Figures you would make Humming and Hawing upon the vulgar  of Jointure and Pin MoneyCome come I know what's proper o'both Sides you shall leave it to me  Hear  I had rather  Maria  would name her own Terms to me▪  Col  Have you a Mind to any Thing particular  To  Maria  Mar  Why sure What Do you think I'm only to be fill'd out here as you please and sweetned and supp'd up like a Dish of  Col  Why pray Madam when your Tea's ready what have you to do but to drink it But you I suppose expect a Lover's Heart like your Lamp should be always flaming at your Elbow and when it's ready to go out you indolently supply it with the Spirit of Contraction  Mar  And so you suppose that your Assurance has made an End of this Matter  Col  Not till you have given him your Hand upon it  Mar  That then would compleat it  Col  Perfectly  Mar  Why then take it  Heartly  Giving her Hand to  Heart  Hear  O soft Surprize Exstatick Joy  Mar  Now I presume you are in high Triumph Sir  To the  Col  Col  No Sister now you are consistent with that good Sense I always thought you Mistress of  Mar  I'm afraid Mr  Heartly  we are both oblig'd to him  Hear  If you think so  Maria  my HeartIs under double Obligations laid  Embracing him  Col  If it cements our Friendship I am overpaid  Exeunt  ACT V  Heartly  and  Maria  Mar  WELL now  Heartly  you have nothing to do but to look forward and if possible to forget what I have been to you Though 'tis a horrid Restraint you lay upon our Sex You first make it the Business of your Lives to blow up our Vanity and then preposterously expect we should be prudent and humble That is you invite us to a Feast where 'tis criminal to taste or have an Appetite You put a Sword into a Child's Hand and then are angry if it does Mischief  Hear  You give up too much  Maria  I never treated you so What might have been Flattery to most Women was but honest Truth to you  Mar  Why look there now Is not that enough to turn any poor Woman into a Changeling  Hear  No because 'tis true charge me with a Falshood and I submit  Mar  Nay then did you not once tell me that all my Airs and Follies were merely put on in Compliance to the World and that good Sense was only natural to me that ev'n my Affectation I have not forgot your Words carried more Sincerity than the serious Vows of other Women  Hear  By all my Happiness I think so still  Mar  What seriously  Hear  Upon my Soul I do  Mar  Lord that's delightful Do you really love me then  Heartly  Do tell me for now I begin to believe every Thing you say to me But don't neitherI am vain still'Twas my Vanity that made me ask you  Hear  Now I don't take it so  Mar  There was some in't I am sure tho' it begins to dwindle I can tell you  Hear  No matter I love you as you are I would not have you lose your Pleasantry  Maria  Mar  Well do let me be silly sometimes  Hear  O I can play with you for that Matter  Mar  Pshah you'll laugh at me  Heart  Not while you are good in Essentials  Mar  Indeed I'll be very good  Hear  O fy that will be the way to make me so  Mar  Lord What signifies Sense where there is so much Pleasure in Folly  Hear  No perfect Passion ever was without it the Pleasure would subside were we always to be wise in it  Mar  For my Part I think so But will you really stand to the Agreement tho' that I have made with the Doctor  Hear  Why not You shall not break your Word upon my Account tho' he might be a Villain you gave it to  Mar  Well I take it as a Compliment not but I have some Hopes of getting over it and justly too but don't let me tell you now I love to surprizeTho' you shall know all if you desire it  Hear  No  Maria  I don't want the Secret I am satisfied in your Inclination to trust me  Mar  Well then I'll keep the Secret only to shew you that you upon Occasion may trust me with one  Hear  After that  Maria  it would be wronging you to ask it But pray Madam has the Doctor yet given you any Proof ofhis having declin'd his Interest to your Father  Mar  Yes he told me just now he had brought him to pause upon it and does not question in Two Days to compleat it but desires in the mean Time you will be ready and punctual with the  Proemium  Hear  Suppose I should talk with Sir  John  my self 'tis true he has slighted me of late but however I ought at least to ask his Consent though I have but little Hopes of it  Mar  By all Means do soHere he comesThis may open another Scene of Action too that we are preparing for  Enter Sir  John  and Lady  Woodvil  who walks apart with  Maria  Sir  John  Mr  Heartly  I am glad I have met with you here  Hear  I have endeavour'd twice to Day Sir to pay my Respects to you  Sir  John  Sir I'll be plain with youI went out to avoid you but where the Welfare of a Child is concern'd  you must not take it ill if we don't stand upon CeremonyHowever since I have Reason now to be more in Temper than perhaps I was at that Time I should be glad to talk with you  Hear  I take it as a Favour Sir  Sir  John  SirDoctor  Wolf  informs me that he is well assured you were horn the Year before the Revolution Now Sir I should be glad to be well satisfied in that Points a greater Consequence depending on it perhaps than you imagine  Hear  Sir I have been always told that was my Age but for your farther Satisfaction I appeal to the Register  Sir  John  Sir I dare believe you and am glad to hear it  Hear  But pray Sir may I beg leave to ask why you are so concerned to know this  Sir  Jo  Because Sir if this be true I am satisfied you may be a  regular Christian  the Doubt of which may have perhaps done you some Disservice in my private Opinion  Hear  Sir if that can reconcile me to it I shall be thankful for the Benefit without considering why I that way came to deserve it  Sir  Jo  That Argument might hold us now too longBut Sirhere's the Caseyour Principles and mine have the Misfortune to differ Yours being as I take it entirely on the Revolution Side  Hear  If I am not misinform'd Sir you your self commanded a Regiment in Defence of it  Sir  John  I did so and thought it just'Twould be fruitless perhaps to offer you the Reasons that since have alter'd my Opinion But now Sir even supposing that I err in Principle you must still allow that Conscience is the Rule that every honest Man ought to walk by  Hear  'Tis granted Sir  Sir  John  Then give me leave to tell you Sir that giving you my Daughter would be to act against that Conscience I pretend to and consequently the same Ties oblige me to bestow her where the same Principles with mine I think deserve herNow Sir consult your own Honour and tell me how you can still pursue my Daughter without doing Violence to mine  Hear  But Sir to shorten this Dispute suppose the Doctor whom I presume you design her for actually consents to give me up his Interest might not that soften your Objections to me  Sir  John  But why do you suppose Sir he would give up his Interest  Hear  I only judge from what your Daughter tells me Sir  Sir  John  My Daughter  Hear  I appeal to her  Mar  And I appeal ev'n to your self SirHas not the Doctor just now in the Garden spoke in Favour of Mr  Heartly  to you Nay pray Sir be plain because more depends on that than you can easily imagine or believe  Sir  John  What senseless Insinuation have you got in your Head now  Mar  Be so kind Sir first to answer me that I may be better able to inform you  Sir  John  Well I own he has declined his Interest in Favour of Mr  Heartly  But I must tell you Madam he did it in so modest so friendly so goodnatur'd so conscientious a Manner that I now think my self more than ever bound in Honour to espouse him  Mar  But now Sir only for Arguments Sake suppose I could prove that all this seeming Virtue was utterly Artificial that his Regard to Mr  Heartly  was neither founded upon Modesty Friendship GoodNature nor Conscience or in short that he has basely betray'd and sold the Trust you made him like a Villain barter'd bargain'd to give me to Mr  Heartly  for half the Four Thousand Pound you have valued his Consent at I say suppose this were the Case where would be his Virtue then Sir  Sir  John  And I say 'tis impious to suppose it  Hear  Under Favour Sir how is it possible your Daughter could know the Doctor had spoke to you upon this Head if he himself had not told her so in Consequence of his Agreement  Sir  John  Sir I don't admit your Consequence Her knowing it from him is no Proof that he might not still resign her from a Principle of Modesty or Good Nature  Mar  Then Sir from what Principle must you suppose that I accuse him  Sir  John  From an obstinate Prejudice to all that's Good and Virtuous  Mar  That's too hard Sir What Blot has stain'd my Life that you can think so of me▪ But Sir the worst your Opinion can provoke me to is to marry Mr  Heartly  without either his Consent or yours  S  r  John  What do you brave me Madam  Mar  in Tears  No Sir but I Scarn a Lye and will so far vindicate my Integrity as to insist on your believing me▪ if not as a Child whom you abandon I have a right to throw my self into other Arms for Protection  Hear  O  Maria  how thy Spirit Charms me  apart to her  Sir  John  I am Confounded those Tears cannot be Counterfeit nor can this be True  Lady W  Indeed my Dear I fear it is it would be Cruel to her Concern to think it wholly false can you suppose she'd urge so gross an Accusation only to expose her self to the Justice of your Resentment  Sir  John  What are you against him too then he has no Friend but me and I cannot at so short a warning give him up to Infamy and Baseness  Lady W  Good Sir be Compos'd and ask your Heart one farther Question  Sir  John  What would you say to me  Lady W  In all our mutual Course of Happiness have I ever yet deceiv'd you with a falshood  Sir  John  Never I grant it nor has my Honest Heart yet Wrong'd thy Goodness with a Jealous Thought of it  Lady W  Would you then believe me should I accuse him too even of Crimes that Vertue Blushes but no mention  Sir  John  To what Extravagance would you drive me  Lady W  I would before have undeceiv'd you when his late Artifice turn'd the Honest Duty of your Son into his own Reproach and Ruine But knowing then your Temper was inaccessible I durst not offer it But now in better Hope of being believ'd I here avow the Truth of all he was accus'd of then  Sir  John  Will you Distract me my Senses could not be deceiv'd  Lady W  Indeed they were he saw you listning and at the Instant turn'd his Impious Barefac'd Leve to me into Equivocal Intercessions pretending to  Maria  Sir  John  You Starrle me  Lady W  Could you otherwise suppose your Son would have brought you to be Witness of his own Weak Malice in Accusing him  Sir  John  I'm all Astonishment  Lady W  Come Sir Suspend your Wonder Respite your Belief ev'n of this till grosser Evidence convinces you Suppose I here before your Face should let you see his Villany make him repeat his Odious Love to me at once throw  off his Mask and shew the Barefac'd Traitor  Sir J  hn  Is it possible Make me but Witness of that Fact and I shall soon Accuse my self and own my Folly equal to his Baseness But Pardon me as I in such a Case would not believe ev'n him Accusing you so am I bound in equal Charity to think you yet may be deceiv'd in what you Charge on him  Lady W  'Tis Justlet it be sowe'll yet suppose him Innocent till you your self pronounce him Guilty and since I have stak'd my Faith upon the Truth of what I urge 'tis fit we bring him to immediate Tryal But then Sir I must beg you to descend ev'n to the poorShifts we are reduc'd to  Sir  John  All to any thing to ease me of my Doubts propose them  Lady W  They that would set Toils for Beasts of Prey must lurk in humble Caves to watch their Haunts  Sir  John  Place me where you please  Lady W  Under this Table is your only Stand the Carpet will conceal you  Sir  John  Be it so I'll take my Post what more  Lady W  Mr  Heartly  shall we beg your Leave and you  Maria  take the least suspected way to send the  Doctor  to me immediately  Mar  I have a Thought will do it Madamcome Sir  Exit  Mar  and  Hear  Lady W  Here Sir take this Cushion you will be Easier Sir  John goes under the Table  Now Sir you must consider how desperate a Disease I have undertaken to Cure therefore you must not winch nor stir too soon at any freedom you Observe me take with him be sure lie Close and Still and when the Proof is full appear at your Discretion  Sir  John  Fear not I'll be Patient  Lady W  Hush he comes  Enter  Doctor  with a Book  Doct  Your Woman told me Madam you were here alone and desir'd to speak with me  Lady W  I did Sir but that we may be sure we are alone pray shut the Outward Door and see that Passage too be clear another Surprize might Ruine usis all safe  Doct  I have taken care Madam  Lady W  I am afraid I interrupt your Meditations  Doct  Say rather you improve them You Madam were the subject of my solitary Thoughts I take in all the little aids I can to Guard my Frailty and truly I have receiv'd  great Consolation from an Unfortunate Example here before me  Lady W  Pray of what kind Sir  Doct  I had just dipt into poor  Eloisas  Passion for  Abelard  It is indeed a piteous Conflict How Terrible How penitent a Sense she shews of Guilty Pleasures past and fruitless Pains to shut them from her Memory  Lady W  I have read her Story Sir  Doct  Is it not pitiful  Lady W  A Heart of Stone might feel for her  Doct  O think then what I endure for you such are my Pains but such is my Sincerity tho' I fear my being reduc'd to feign a Passion for  Maria  in my late Surprize has done dishonour to the Vows I then preferr'd to You  Lady W  'Twas on that Point I wanted now to talk with you not knowing then how fat you might mistake my Silence Now had I clos'd with the Colonel in Accusing You it would have been plain I was your Enemy as had I joyn'd in your Defence against him it had been as grossly evident I was his but since I have Uses for his Friendship and as I saw your Credit with Sir  John  needed no support I hope you'll think betwixt the two Extremes I have acted but a prudent Part  Doct  Let me presume to hope then what I did you Judge was SelfDefence and pure Necessity  Lady W  'Twas wonderful Surprizing to perfection The Wit of itbut I won't tell you what effect it had upon me  Doct  Why Madam let me beseech you  Lady W  No 'twas nothingbesidewhat need you ask me  Doct  Why do you thus decoy my foolish Heart and feed it with such  Hybla  drops of Flattery You cannot sure think Kindly of me  Lady W  O well feign'd Fear You too I sind can flatter in your Turn You know how well the subtle force of Modesty prevails O Men Men Men  Doct  'Twere Arrogance to think I have deserv'd this Goodness but treat me as you please I'll be at least sincere to you and frankly own I still suspect that all this sosrning Favour is but Artifice  Lady W  Well well I'd have you think so  Doct  What Transport would it give to be assur'd I wrong you but O I fear this Shaddow of Compliance  is only meant to lure me from  Maria  and then as fond  Ixions  were of old to fill my Arms with Air  Lady W  Methinks this Doubt of me seems rather founded on your second Thoughts of not resigning Her 'tis she I find is your substantial Happiness  Doct  O that you could but fear I thought so how easy 'twere to prove my Coldness or my Love  Lady W  O Sir you have convinc'd me Now of Both  Doct  Can all this pretty Anger then be real take heed fair Creature it flatters more than Kindness  Lady W  I can assure you Sir I should have spar'd you this trouble had I known how deeply you were engag'd to her  Doct  Nay then I must believe you but indeed you wrong me to prove my Innocence 'tis not an Hour since I press'd Sir  John  to give  Maria  to Young  Heartly  Lady W  O all Artifice you knew that modest resignation would make Sir  John  but warmer in your Interest  Doct  Since you will ripe the secret from my Heartknow then I actually have Sold her like a Bawble to her Childish Lover for two thousand times her Value  Lady W  Are you serious  Doct  As this is true or false may I in you be Blest or Miserable  Lady W  But how can you suppose Sir  John  will ever hear of it  Doct  Alas poor Man he knows not his own Weakness he's molded into any shape if you but gently stroke his Humour I dare depend on his Consentbeside I intend to Morrow to perswade him 'tis for the Interest of our  Cause  it should be so and then I have him sure  Lady W  Fy how is that possible he can't be so implicitly Credulous You don't take him sure for a  Roman  Catholick  Doct  Umnot absolutelyBut poor Soul he little thinks how near he is one 'Tis true name to him but  Rome  or Popery he Startles as at a Monster But Gild its grossest Doctrines with the Stile of  English Catholick  he swallows down the Poison like a Cordial  Lady W  Nay if he's so far within your Power it cannot fail He must consent well Sir now I give you leave to guess the Reason why I too at our last meeting so warmly prest you to resign  Maria  Doct  Is it possible was I then so early your Concern  Lady W  You cannot blame me sure for having there oppos'd your Happiness  Doct  I dye upon the Transport  taking her Hand  Lady W  Be sure you are secret now your least Imprudence makes these like Fair favours vanish in a Moment  Doct  How can you form so vain a Fear  Lady W  Call it not vain for let our Converse end in what it may you still shall find my Fame is Dear to me as Life  Doct  Where can it find so sure a guard the grave Austerity of my Life will strike Suspicion Dumb and yours may mock the Malice of Detraction I am no Giddy LooseLiv'd Courtier whose false profession end only his Boast of Favours No fair spotless Miracle the Mysterie of Love are only fit for Hearts Recluse and Elevate as mine my Happiness like yours depending on my Secrecy  Lady W  'Tis you must answer for this Folly  Doct  I take it whole upon my self the guilt be only mine but be our Transports Mutualcome lovely Creature let us withdraw to privacy where murmuring love shall hush thy Fears and lose them in the Burning Joy  Sir  John  step  ng softly behind him seizes him by the Throat  Sir  John  Traytor  Doct  Ah  Astonisht  Sir  John  Is this thy Sanctity this thy Doctrine these thy Meditations If stung with my Abuses I now should Stab thee to the Heart what Devil durst murmur 'twere not an Act of Justice But since thy Vile Hypocrisy unmask'd must make Mankind Abhor thee be thy own shame thy living with Punishment  Doct  Do Triumph Siryour Artifice has well succeededI see your Ends you needed not so deep a Plot to part with me  Trembling  Sir  John  Suppress thy weak evasionsUngrateful Wretch Have I for this redeem'd thee from the Jaws of gaping Poverty Fed Cloath'd Loved Preferr'd thee to my Bosom to my Family and Fortune Wife Children Friends Servants all that were not Friends to thee accounted as my Enemies nay more to Crown my Faith in thee I have relied on they Integrity ev'n for my Future Happiness And how hast thou in one short Day requited me Taking the Advantage of my Blinded Passion thou hast turn'd the Duty of my Son to his Undoing Sordidly hast Sold the Trust I made thee of my Daughter  Attempted like a Felonious Traytor to seduce my Wife and hast I fear with Poisonous Doctrines too ensnar'd my Soul  Lady W  Now Heav'n be prais'd his Heart seems Conscious of his Error

with Summs of Money which he pretended if accounted for might Endanger both of us  Lady W  O the Subtle Villain those Summs are Innocent I dare answer for them But is there nothing more  Sir  John  Not that I can call to Mind more Criminal  Lady W  Pray tell the worst that we may Arm against him  Sir  John  Sometimes with my own Hand I have reliev'd the wants of Wretched Prisoners to the State  Lady W  We have no Laws that Frown on Acts of Charity if that were Criminal the Government it self is guilty  Sir  John  How far our private converse may affect meThat I know not If  Charles  Betrays me not I think his Malice cannot reach me  Lady W  Then Sir be easy for he has lost his Influence there  Charles  has long since perceiv'd his Villany and grew from thence a secret Convert to the Cause of Truth and Loyalty of which he has given such Meritorious Proof that Mr  Heartly  and your Son this very Day Sir have obtain'd his Pardon  Sir  John  You tell me Wonders Pardon'd and a Convert  say you how strongly are our Hearts persuaded by Example what Darkness have I Wander'd in▪ How Aimiable is such Royal Mercy yet with what hardned Malice has that Slave traduced it  Enter  Maria

I was passing by the Hall I heard him Earnest in Discourse with  Charles  and upon their Naming you I stopt a while to listen where I heard the  Doctor  Urge to him that you were False at Heart that from your late Frivolous pretence to break with him he was convinc'd your Malice now would stop at nothing to undo him that  Charles  himself was equally in Danger and that to save your own Life you certainly design'd to Sacrifice theirs to the Government which there was no Possibility of preventing but by their immediate joining in a Charge of Treason against You  Lady W  O the Villain 'tis well we are secure in  Charles  Sir  John  If we are not why be it as it mayI will not stirI'll stand upon my Innocence or if that's Betray'd will throw me on the Mercy of that Royal Breast whose Vertues

 Your Servant Sir we know him better  Doct  Then Sir I demand my Liberty that the Government too may know him  Charles  Yes and let it too be known you first seduc'd me to Rebel and now would have me Expiate my Offence with Perjury  Doct  How Sir  Charles  Yes Perjury for such it must have been should I have charg'd as you'd have had me this Gentleman with Treason What Facts have I been privy to that reach that Name The Worst I know of him is that all the Factious Falshoods you have rais'd against the best of Princes he blinded with your Hypocrisy believ'd  Doctor  'Tis well Sir you are protected now  Charles  This Sir in short has been our Cause of Quarrel The  Doctor  finding I receiv'd with Coldness his vile designs against your Life began to offer menaces on mine if I comply'd not at which I smiling told him the Disappointments of his Love had made him Desperate This stung him into Rage and fastning at my Throat he answer'd Villain you'll be Humbler when you groan in Chains for this Here indeed all Temper left me when disengaging from his hold with One Home Blow I fell'd him reeling to the Pavement at this grown Desp erate he ran with Fury to some Pistols that hung above the Chimney to Revenge him I in the Instant as he reach'd one seiz'd upon his Wrist and as we grappled Sir the Pistol firing to the Cieling alarm'd the Family when Mr  Heartly  and your Servants rusht

unsatisfied  Sir  John  O I have seen too much every new instance of his Wickedness but adds afresh to my Confusion  Lady W  Now Sir is your Time  apart  Hear  I go this Minute Madam  apart  Doct  I Value not your whisper'd menaces for know to your Confusion my Vengeance is not yet Defeated You'll find Sir that to Rebel or to Conceal a Rebel are in the Eye of Law both Equal Acts of Treason That Fact I'm sure is evident against you There there stands in Proof the  riling Traytor you have Shelter'd this Sir your whole Family can Charge you with and Swear it home they shall or Load their Souls with Perjury but then to dash your few remaining Days with Bitterness of Misery Remember I Sir whom Mortally you hate succeed the Instant Heir to your Possessions Now farewell and let Disgrace and Beggary be your Childrens Portion  As he is going out the  Collonel  stops him  Col  Hold Sir not so fast you cannot pass  Doct  Who Sir shall dare to stop me  Col  Within there March  Enter a

one  Collonel Perth  Sir  Doct  Ha then I am Betray'd indeed  Hear  This  Perth  it seems Sir has m  nag'd his Correspondence at  Avignon  from whence he came last Night Express but the Government having Immediate Notice of his Arrival he was this Morning seiz'd and Examin'd before the Council where among other Facts he has confest he knew the  Doctor  actually in Arms at the first Rebellious rising in  Northumberland  which has been since by other Witnesses confirm'd  Col  And Sir to Convince you that ev'n the Doctrine he has Broach'd could never flow from the pure Fountain of our Establisht Faith Here are Affidavits in my Hand that prove him under his Disguise a lurking Emissary  of  Rome  that he is actually a Priest in  Popish  Orders and has several times been seen as such to Officiate Publick Mass in the Church of  Noster Dame  at  Antwerp  Mar Hear and Lady W  How  Sir  John  I start with Horror ev'en at the Danger I am freed from  Col  And now Sir had not your Insatiate Villanys to this Family fac'd me to this close Inquiry into your Private Life Perhaps you might have pass'd unquestion'd among the Rout of Enemies whom our Government Despises  Doct  Well Sir now then you know your worst of me But know what you call Criminal may yet before your Triumph is secure not only find its Pardon but Reward I yet may Live Sir to retort your Insult ot least the Days that are alotted me will want for no supports of Life while this Conveyance calls me Master  Sir  John  There there indeed he stings me to the Heart For that rash act reproach and endless Shame will haunt me  Mar  No Sirbe Comforted for ev'n there too his abandon'd hope must leave him  Sir  John  Why dost thou totrure me did I not Sign that Deed  Mar  Yes Sir but in that Deed you'll find my Brother Not that Traytor is your Heir For know the fatal Deed which you intended Sir to Sign is here ev'n yet unseal'd and Innocent  Omnes  Ha  The  Doctor  hastily openes the Deed to examine it and all the Company seems surpriz'd  Sir  John  What means she  Mar  I mean Sir that this Deed by accident falling into this Gentlemans Hands his generous Concern for our Family discover'd it to me when I reduc'd to this Extremity instantly procur'd that other to be drawn exactly like it which in your Impatience Sir to execute pass'd unsuspected for the Original their only difference is that wherever here you read the  Doctors  Name there you'll find my Brothers only throughout and wholly Sir in every Article investing him in all that Right and Title which you intended for your Mortal Enemy  Doct  Distraction Outwitted by a Brainless Girl  Throws down the Writing in Rage  All the Servants having attended to the Discovery break out into Huzzahs of Joy c while Sir  John  the  Col Charles  and  Maria  severally embrace  Heartily  and  Lady Woodvil  silently join in their Congratulations  Doct  I cannot bear their irksome Joycome Sir lead me where you pleasea Dungeon would releive me now  Col

Blind indeed were I not now convinc'd He must in all things have alike deceiv'd me as the Dial that misstels one Hour of Consequence is false through the whole round of Day Let it suffice I see my Errors with a Conscious Shame but hope when I am justly Weigh'd you'll find those Errors rose but from a Ductile Heart not Disinclin'd to Truth but fatally misled by false Appearances  Col  Whoever knows your Private Life must think you Sir in this Sincere  Hear  And Now Sir since I am sure it will no more Offend you give me leave to Observe that of all the Arts our Enemies make use on to Embroil us none seem so Audaciously Preposterous as their Insisting that a Nations best Security is the Word of a Prince whose Religion Indulges him to give it and at the same time Obliges him to break it And tho' perhaps in lesser Points our Politick Disputes won't suddenly be ended methinks there's one Principle that all Partys might easily come into that no Change of Government can give us a Blessing equal to our Liberty  Grant us but this and then of Course you'll own  To Guard that Freedom  GEORGE  must fill the Throne  FINIS  Epilogue  Spoken by Mrs Oldfield  HOW Wild how Frantick is
