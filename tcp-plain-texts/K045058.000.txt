to have an Understanding solid and extensive and a Wit at once the most poignant and yet the most inoffensive  and agreeable may justly raise Admiration and Esteem in others as they distinguish You in so eminent a manner and constitute your personal Happiness  But as it is that easy graceful manner in which You enjoy them that Freedom from Vanity Affectation or Pride which form your real Character so the Use You make of Your Fortune Interest and good Sense renders them a general Blessing to all who have the Happiness of being within the Reach of their Influence  MADAM    Your Generosity and Condescention in permitting this Address  is an Instance of Both so much to my Advantage that I find it impossible to suppress either my Pride or Gratitude on this Occasion especially when I consider that it is an Honour that many before have Solicited in vain  That the Conversation and Friendship of a Lady of your Accomplishments should be highly Esteemed by Persons of the first Rank both for Dignity and Virtue not to mention the Noble Lord to whom you are so happily Ally'd is no more a Wonder than that there should be among the Nobility those who are as eminent for their good Sense and fine Taste as their high Stations  That You may still continue the Ornament of your own Sex and the Admiration of ours must be the sincere Wish of all who are any ways acquainted with your Merit but of none more than of  MADAM  Your Grateful and Obliged Humble Servant  November  On  Thursday  next will be Publish'd wherein are a great Variety of New Tunes by the most Eminent Masters and compleats

depends the Happiness or Ruin of my dear and only Child and all my future PeaceWhy am I thus alarm'd The Event must sure be happy I have long with Pleasure beheld their mutual LoveThe end of all my Hopes and Fears is nearThis happy Marriage will restore my longlost Peace of MindAfter Marriage shou'd he prove false or unkindwhat Means are leftwhat Power on Earth can do her Justice thenNow my Pains return thus Joy and Anguish alternately possess my Breast as Hope or Fear prevails  AIR I Since all the World's in Strife  The Man by Foes surrounded  Whilst with himself at Peace  Dauntless and unconfounded  Beholds their Rage increase  But oh the torturing Pain  That racks his Heart and Brain  Who hourly with himself at War  The Foe does in his Bosom bear  Shall this Tempest in my Breast  E'er cease and I have Rest  E'er cease and I have Rest  SCENE II  Welford  and  Jonathan  Jonathan  Sir  John  tarries long  Jon  That is not to be wonder'd at when he is in such good Company I know my Master never thinks himself so happy as when he is with your fair Daughter  Welf  Jonathan  I have observ'd of all Sir  John  's Servants that you who indeed seem best to deserve it have the greatest share in his Confidence and Favour Now you are not ignorant of my Friendship for your Master nor of his Pretensions of Love to my  Silvia  both which must interest me nearly in every thing that relates to him I have lately heard some Reflections on his Conduct that much alarm me You if you will can satisfy my Doubts without Prejudice to your own Fidelity or your Master's Honour  Jon  Ay dear Sir I know that any Discoveries which I might make to you wou'd be as safe as in my own Bosom and all the Use you wou'd make of 'em wou'd be to improve 'em if possible to my Master's Advantage and not at all to my  Prejudice What a wicked censorious World do we live in My Master is certainly the most virtuous sober modest Gentleman in the Country and to say Truth we are a mighty regular Family For my part I am daily edify'd by his good Example  Welf  This Fellow mocks me    Aside    The Business of my Farm and the Care of my Flocks call me hence Farewel My best Respects and Service to Sir  John    SCENE III  Jonathan  Ha ha ha a pretty Jest truly discover my Master's Secrets for nothingwhen I'm so well paid for keeping 'em  AIR II Gami'orum  The Servant that betrays his Trust  Who's imploy'd in search of Beauty  To his Master and himself unjust  Has neither Sense nor Duty  Priests and Lawyers by the Throng  Are well paid for their Pratling  What Fool then wou'd use his Tongue  Who loses by his Tatling  Gami'orum  c    Exit Singing  SCENE IV  Another Room in  Welford  's House  Sir  John Freeman  and  Silvia  Sil  Urge me no fartherI have said too much How have you drawn from me the fond Confession  Sir John  Meerly to say you wou'd obey your Father is that too much to pay whole Years spent in Adoration of your Charms  Sil  What can you ask or what can I say more  Sir John  Can ardent Love be satisfy'd with Duty You might have said as much to any other Man who shou'd have gain'd  your Father's Approbation You have not yet my charming Fair confess'd you love  Sil  Why will you press me to pass the Bounds of Modesty and Prudence you know my Father does not force my Will  Sir John  Why then this needless Caution and Reserve your cruel Coldness chills me to the Heart You never felt Love's animating Fire some other Motive in which Love has no part must influence you to admit of my Addresses  Sil  Your Suspicions are as groundless as unkind There may be Men false designing cruel and unjust who court and flatter only to deceive wou'd it be therefore just to charge the Crimes of some on all and for your constant Love Truth and Sincerity return you Doubts Suspicions and unjust Reproaches There may be Women too who for Wealth or Power wou'd give their Hands where they refuse their Hearts If you think me such a one for my sake and your own desist at once for Love that is not founded on Esteem can never yield true Satisfaction or continue long  Sir John  Pardon my dearest  Silvia  a Fault caus'd only by Excess of LoveThou art so great a Blessing 'twere Presumption to be too secure Long we suspect and hardly are convinc'd that the Treasure on which our Happiness depends shall ever be attain'd But now my Fears are husht and all my Doubts are fled  AIR III Blithe  Jockey  young and gay  Sweet are the Joys of Love  When Doubts and Fears are past  Sil  Virtue does Love improve  Truth makes it ever last  Sir John  All Virtues in thee shine  Sil  Whate'er I am is thine  Both  Hearts thus united prove  Earth has no Joy like Love  Sir John  When Love's sincere and constant how does it bless and how improve Mankind yet ambitious Statesmen and foolish medling Priests wou'd bind in Fetters the noble freeborn Passion Vain AttemptMarriage ne'er yet kindled a mutual Flame where it was not but often has extinguish'd it where it was Love is its self its own Security and needs no other Bonds  Sil  This idle Talk this commonplace Raillery on Marriage I think at any Time is best omitted but sure Sir  John  'tis most improper now You can't expect that a Maid who is not weary of her Condition will take upon her the Defence of a Cause in which she is not concern'd yet to pleasure you who I presume delight to hear me talk tho' I thereby discover my own Simplicity this I will say the World owes its Order Kingdoms their peaceful regular Succession and private Families their Domestick Happiness to Marriage  Sir John  The Prejudice of Education only makes you reason thus I must instruct you better  Sil  Sir  John  I understand you not  Sir John  You shall joyn with me by our Example to convince the World that Love can subsist without the Marriage Tye  Sil  Sir  John Freeman  I have known you long bred up under one Roof from Infancy together I don't remember when I knew you not The innocent Friendship contracted in our Childhood in you improv'd to Love or you have been a thousand Times forsworn If I have been deceiv'd when may a Virgin safely believe a Man I wou'd not wrong your Honour by unjust Suspicionsbut if you have abus'd me  Sir John  If I love thee not or if I ever cease to love thee may I become the most wretched and most accurst of MenMay I  Sil  Imprecate no more Wave this Discourse and I am satisfy'd  Sir John  'Tis time my  Silvia  to compleat our Joys    Takes her by the Hand    You must now quit your Father's humble Roof and shine with me My Wealth great as it is shall be exhausted to support thy Pleasures Love only Love shall be the Priest to joyn us Enjoyment shall be our Marriage    She struggles    Each Day I shall a happy Bridegroom be and you a Bride  Mahomet  's Paradise shall be verify'd in us and all our long Lives shall be but one continu'd Transport  Sil  Let go my Hand  Sir John  And lest you shou'd think I mean to deceive and to forsake you no proud Heiress that brings a Province for her Portion shall be joyntur'd as you shall be Half my Estate shall be settled on thee  Sil  With brutal Force to compel me to hear thy hated Proposals is such InsolenceThy Breath is blasting and thy Touch infectious Oh that my Strength was equal to my Indignation I'd give my Hand a Ransom for my Body    Breaks from him  Sir John  Stay my charming angry Fair and hear me speak  Sil  Wou'd I had never heard you Oh that 'twere possible to fly where I might never hear the Voice of Mankind moreWhat set a Price on my Immortal Soul and spotless Fame Know thou ungenerous Man I ne'er was influenced by thy Wealth to hearken to thy Vows for notwithstanding my humble Birth and Fortune I ever scorn'd Riches when compar'd to Love as now I do Love and Thee compar'd to Virtue She who capitulates on Terms like these confesses an Equivalent may be had for Innocence and Fame and there by forfeits both  AIR IV Tweed Side  By our Weakness we help the Deceit  If our Virtue we ballance with Gold  When Dishonour's propos'd if we treat  We're to Ruin and Infamy sold  The Bird that beholds the Snares laid  Yet presumptuously plays with the Bait  By its Rashness and Folly betray'd  Repents and grows wiser too late  SCENE V  Sir  John Freeman  Sir John  Jonathan  SCENE VI  Sir  John Freeman  and  Jonathan  Jon  Sir  Sir John  Order the Groom to bring the Horses to the Gate  SCENE VII  Sir  John Freeman  I have made a bold but unsuccessful Attempt and by it perhaps have lost her for everperhaps notI wou'd fain see her once more methinksAnd yet there is but little likelyhood of our coming to an Agreement I am resolv'd never to marry and she seems as much resolv'd never to comply without it Whatever is the Meaning of it I find my self more asham'd than angry at the Disappointment Tho' 'tis certain that I never did nor ever can love any other Woman half so well I feel a strange Palpitation here    Sighing    I am not sure that I don't like her the better for refusing meI am sure of nothingbut that I won't marryI must e'en have recourse to the general Remedy in these Cases a less scrupulous Female For tho' that won't remove the Cause yet it is an admirable Opiate and relieves the Symptoms to a Miracle  AIR V Charming is your Face  Wounded by the scornful Fair  Since she dooms me to Despair  Let me fly to seek for Rest  On some softer gentler Breast  Whose free Soul no Forms enslave  But kindly heals the Wounds she gave  SCENE VIII  A Country Village  The Funeral attended by  Timothy Stitch  as chief Mourner  Lettice Ploughshare Gaffer Gabble Goody Busy Goody Gabble Goody Costive  c crosses the Stage The  Sexton  remains    Sex  A very pretty Fancy this of being buried in her Cloaths If it were once a Fashion a  Sexton  might get as much as an Overseer of the Poor Every Man is for making the most of his Place But then there is no Comparison between starving the Living and robbing the Dead for what shou'd dead Folks do with CloathsBut the Truth of it is in these healthy Countries the Poor live so shamefully long that ParishOfficers get little now beside good Eating and DrinkingBut I have heard that formerly such as were past their Labour used to be provided for at the Expence of the Sherifffor then if Persons were likely to become chargeable to the Parish the  whole Neighbourhood wou'd swear that they were Witches or Wizards and so they were decently hang'd up to save ChargesBut in  London  and other your great Towns an industrious Man of my Business may make a good Penny of it stillfor there they steal Bodies and all but here we're forc'd to let them rot in their Graves because we can't tell what else to do with them  AIR VI There was a Jovial BeggarMan  Strange Tales some lying Travellers tell  How Men on Men have fed  Of publick Shambles where they sell  For Food their Friends when dead  The Moral of the Fable thus  Men that are wise unfold  No matter so you fill your Purse  Tho' Living and Dead be sold  SCENE

Sorrow  Whereunto we all must come  As she today so we tomorrow  May arrive at our long Home  G Busy  Ah poor  Dorothy Stitch  Rest her Soul She was the handsomest Woman in all our Parish But Beauty

your pretty Face  Let  What's that to you  Plou  'Tis very well Mrs  Lettice Stitch  Let  So it is Mr  Ned Ploughshare  I ben't afraid of your telling my Mother now    Goes from him  G Busy  Good  Timothy Stitch  don't take on so We did not all come together nor must we all go together and our Loss is her Gain as we all know Neighbours  Omn  Ay ay to be sure  G Busy  Since we must live by the Living and not by the Dead you ought to thank Heaven and be contented  AIR VIII Oh oh I've lost my Love  Tim  Whom cruel Death does sever  Hum hum  Dreadful Thought they part for ever  Hum hum  G Busy  Yet herein still Fortune kind is  Faralall    When one's gone more left behind is  Taralall    A poor Woman who has lost one Husband and is unprovided of another has indeed Cause enough of Grief For tho' she be ever so much afraid to lye alone she can't for very Shame ask a Man to be her Bedfellow  G Gab  Ay ay 'tis very true  Goody Busy  tho' 'tis indeed a very hard Case But Neighbour  Stitch  here need but ask and have  G Busy  She is in the Right of it  Timothy Stitch  we all know what a good Husband you was to your last Wife Here's  Goody Costive  herself is a Widow But I say no more spare to speak and spare to speed all the World over  AIR IX  John  of  Bow    Plou  While you neglect the Living  For the Dead thus grieving  Your Sorrows are encreas'd  Joy to slight for Anguish  Fondly thus to languish  Is fasting at a Feast  You well deserve  To pine and starve  Who eat not when you may  Each Woman right  Or dull or bright  Can give Delight  For in the Night  Sure ev'ry Cat is Grey  Tim  How cou'd you name another Wife to me Where shall I find another like my First Twenty Winters did we live in Love together and never quarrell'd once in all our Lives  G Busy  What he says is very true Neighbours but he may thank himself for that For let her say or do whatever she wou'd he wou'd never quarrel with her Not but that the Woman was a very good Woman in the main  Omn  Yes yes a very good Woman in the main  G Gab  Tho' I can't but say she had an ugly way with her of abusing every Body  G Cost  Ay ay we all know that she was the greatest Scold in the Parish  G Gab  And that she swore like a Trooper  G Cost  And then she wou'd run in every Body's Debt and pay no Body by her Goodwillas if she had been a Gentlewoman  G Busy  Yet for all that the Woman was a good Woman in the main  Omn  O yes a very good Woman in the main  G Busy  Tho' she was Proud  G Gab  And Lazy  G Cost  And Thievish  Wom  And Impudent  Wom  And Whorish  Wom  But above all a sad Drunkard  G Gab  Ah poor Creature that was her Death for we all know she died in her Drink  G Cost  Ah poor Soul we all lov'd her to be sure and wou'd not speak any Harm of her for the World  G Busy  Oh no to be sure for it wou'd be a wicked thing of us to speak Ill of the Dead that cannot answer for themselves  Gaff Gab  O yes a very wicked thing to be sure Tho' they do say it is all the Fashion in  London  the more Shame for 'em I think  AIR X Hunt the Squirrel  G Busy  The Gentlefolks of  London    Infamy scattering  Neighbours bespattering  Care not who are undone  But blast both Living and Dead  Gaff Gab  On high and low  They Scandal throw  Wou'd you the Reason find  'Tis 'cause they fear  Themselves t'appear  The worst of Humankind  The Moon is rising 'tis time to be going home Let the Sexton fill up the Grave  Tim  Let the Grave remain uncover'd I'll take care of that for here I mean to tarry 'till the Morning Neighbours I thank you all AdieuI wish you well to your several HomesGood Night  Gaff Gab  Stay here in the cold Churchyard all Night with thy dead WifeWhy you are distracted surely  G Gab  If he been't that were enough to make him so  Tim  Nay never go about to persuade me for here I will stay come Life come Death Therefore Neighbours all go home and leave me to my self  AIR XI Hey ho who's above  Gaff Gab  Hey ho the Man is mad  G Busy  Troth if he is not he's as bad  Gaff Gab  Thou'lt dye e're Morning too I fear  G Busy  Leave off thy Fooling and don't stay here  Tim  No no  Gaff Gab G Busy  Why why  Tim  I'd rather stay here with my  Dolly  and dye  G Busy  This is the strangest Vagary to pretend to stay here with his Wife when she's dead when there are so few Men who care for their Wives Company while they are alive  Tim  My Resolution may seem stranger than it is I will therefore tell you the Reason of it Some time ago my Wife was very sick that cursed  Geneva  often made her so then I fell sick with Grief but she soon recovering I recover'd too On this Occasion she told me if I dy'd first that she shou'd break her Heart Yet she is dead and I hardhearted and ungrateful Wretch am here alive to speak it  G Busy  Poor Heart he weeps like any rainy Day But good  Timothy  go on with your Tale  Tim  Let me but dry my Eyes and then I will She said that she had heard of People that had been buried alive and being troubled with Fits thought perhaps that might be her Case  G Cost  Ay ay we all know what sort of Fits she was troubled withalBut Mum for that    Aside  Tim  And desir'd me if I outliv'd her to let her be buried in her best Cloaths and to watch the Grave the first Night all alone nor to let the Body be cover'd 'till the Morning I promis'd to grant her Request and now will keep my Word Nay tho' the Ghosts of all those whose Bodies have been buried here should rise to drive me hence I wou'd not leave the Place 'till Morning  G Busy  O terrible I shake like an old Barn in a windy Day to hear him talk of it  AIR XII Oh that I was and I wish that I were  Tim  Darkness and Death no Fear alarms  In them who Light and Life despise  Will Life restore her to my Arms  Or Light reveal her to my Eyes  Then Oh that I were and I wish that I were  In the cold Grave where my true Love lies  G Gab  This is downright Madness  Gaff Gab  And we shall be as mad as he to let him have his Will Therefore since Persuasion won't do Force must  Omn  Ay ay let us carry him home by Force  Gaff Gab  Here some of you help to hold him while others fill up the Grave  Tim  Hold hold Neighbours and hear me speak If you fill up the Grave and force me hence before I have perform'd my Promise I will never eat drink or sleep more  Let  Oh dear why that will be the Death of him  G Cost  To be sure  Gaff Gab  Nay then I'll have no Hand in it  G Gab  Nor I  G Cost  Nor I  G Busy  Perhaps we may bring our selves into Trouble about it  G Gab  I think we are in a worse Quandary now than we were before  G Cost  What must we do in this Case  G Busy  Pray you now hear me speak  Omn  Ay ay let us hear  Goody Busy  speak  G Cost  Ay ay she's a notable Woman and a Midwife and knows what's fit as well as any Woman in the Parish  G Busy  I say it is dangerous playing with edg'd Toolsand we ought to do as we would be done byand it is ill medling between a Man and his WifeAnd every honest Man is as good as his WordAnd the Will of the Dead ought to be perform'dTherefore let us leave him to keep his Promise to his Wife  G Cost  Ah dear Heart there are not many like him More is the Pity  Omn  Good Night  Timothy  Heaven preserve

Busy  Priss Cis Sue Marg'ry  and  Nan  In the Morning early  With us shall come to cheer the Man  Who lov'd his Wife sincerely  Cho  The Bells must ring  And the Clerk must sing  And the good old Wives must wind us  You and I  And all must dye  And leave this World behind us  SCENE X  Timothy  Now from the Fields the Labourers homeward go each one to kiss his Wife with sweet Content A good

end my Care  Sil  Long must I this Torture bear  Tim  Long must I  c  It seems indeed the Voice of one complaining but one of that false deceitful Sex which only seems unhappy when it wou'd make ours so indeed Perhaps some busy prying Wretch has stole unheeded on my Sorrows and with scornful Repetitions mocks my real Woes  SCENE II  Timothy  and  Silvia  Tim  Forgive fair Maid an unhappy Man who

Force She's very handsomeWhat may she not be forc'd to  Sil  Fear it not Innocence is the Care of Heaven Virtue will give her Resolution to resist Temptation and Strength to oppose Violence should it

lives at a Farm hard by will soon be here who will I'm sure assist you with any thing that his poor House affords or Power commands  Tim  This Kindness to a Stranger Heaven will reward  Sil  Acts of Humanity reward themselves  Tim  I give you too much Trouble  Sil  They shew themselves unworthy of their Kind who seeing their FellowCreatures in Distress take not a Pleasure in relieving them Are

Marriage did he not  Sil  O Father why did you ever suffer him to talk of Love or me to hear him  Wel  There is no Shame in virtuous Love The most modest Virgin may hear and may return it too without a Blush  Sil  Oh  Wel  Why weeps my Child What mean these Sighs and all these Agonies of Grief as if thy Heart would burst  Sil  O I have cause to weep despair and die for I have heard from the Man who swore a thousand times he lov'd me the Man I lov'd the Man you bid me love such vile Proposals  Wel  O I am all on Firesay  Silvia  what did he propose  Sil  What is not fit for you to hear nor me

human and divine despise  Not thinking what they're doing  But did they make the Case their own  A Child or Sister thus undone  With Horror struck they sure would shun  Nor tempt such dreadful Ruin  Sil  Vain of his Wealth and his superior Birth with bold  centious Freedom he rail'd on Marriage then talk'd to me of Love Enjoyment and eternal Truth endeavouring by imposing on my Simplicity to render me vile as his own Ends More he talk'd of Estates and Settlements and I know not what and more he would have talk'd but I with just Indignation fired flew from his hated Presence  AIR XXVII One Evening as I lay  Ah me unhappy Maid  How wretched is my Fate  Deceiv'd thus and betray'd  To love where I should hate  When Hope has fled our Breast  Why should Desire remain  To rob us of our Rest

against a Man so powerfulthe Attempt would prove your RuinLet me not see himlet him not insult me with his Presenceby that means to be secur'd from new Injuries is all the Vengeance I desire  Wel  He never shall unless he comes with deep Remorse and humble Penitence to ask your Pardon and make you Reparation  Sil  Let him not come at all The Man who takes Advantage from a Maid's mean Condition to attempt her Virtue can never make her Reparation  Wel  I fear you hate him then  Sil  Why should you fear it You methinks should wish it rather 'Twas long before my Heart was taught to love him and by the Pain his Cruelty gives me I fear 'twill be much longer e're it will learn to hate him  Wel  I'll go and give Orders that Care be taken of the Stranger and then I'll see this mighty Man who by a

Power you may injure without Danger yet I must tell you that 'tis base to wrong a poor Man  meerly because he is so and not always so safe as you may imagine  Sir John  I little expected such an Accusation from any Man much less  Welford  from you whatever other Faults I may have Pride and Cruelty I thank Heav'n are Strangers to my Nature If you are uneasy that your Lease is unrenew'd the Fault is in your self you might have had it done at any time upon your applying to me  Wel  It is not that which I complain of tho' your refusing it be the Ruining me and my whole Family yet as it is a Matter of Courtesy not Right you are at your LibertyBut that is not what I now come to speak of  Sir John  My Love of Pleasure has not so far wasted my Estate or debauched my Principles as to tempt me to wrong any Man much less the Poor The less they have a Right to the greater Necessity there is of preserving them in the quiet Possession of that Right  Wel  Are not our Children the best and dearest Part of our Properties Is there a Monarch in the Universe that does not esteem an Heir to his Crown dearer than the Crown he wears Nature is alike in all The meanest Wretch who daily labours for the Bread with which he feeds his poor Offspring loves them as much as the greatest King can his  AIR XXXVIII On yonder high Mountain  The powerful Law of Nature  Doth Savage Tygers bind  What fierce or cruel Creature  But to its Young is kind  By Hunger strong oppress'd  They forgoe their needful Prey  Love confessing  Still caressing  Shall Man do less than they  Sir  John  I have a Daughter  Sir John  You have a fair one  Wel  True she is fair but her Beauty is her least Perfection  Sir John  In the Bloom of Youth she hath Wisdom Prudence and Modesty beyond what I have observ'd in the most venerable Old Age  Wel  And to crown all an inflexible Virtue that sets her as much above Temptation from Flattery Wealth or Power as they are beneath her true Value  Sir John  She is indeed the  Phoenix  of her Sex  Wel  'Tis no Boasting but modest Truth in a Father to say she is Then where is your Judgment or Gratitude Have I not preferr'd you to many Gentlemen of superior Merit and Fortune in your Addresses to my  Silvia    Sir John  I own the Obligation andbut that I am resolv'd never to marry  Wel  Not marry Sir Why 'tis a Debt due to your Ancestorsyou are the Medium 'twixt them and Posterity which in you must fail unless prevented by a prudent and timely Choice and an ample Estate obtain'd by their Industry be possess'd by Strangers to their Blood  Sir John  As to my Ancestors they have had their time as I now have mine they liv'd to please themselves and so will I As to Posterity I shall not trouble my self about what I know nothing of and which may or may not be notwithstanding all the Care we can take about it  Wel  Since I find what I hop'd had been only the Warmth of Youth to be Principles with you you are justly accountable for their Consequences  Sir John  Notwithstanding your present Circumstances I look upon you as a Gentleman In your Youth as a Soldier of Fortune you had Opportunities of knowing the World beyond most Men which join'd to your good Sense and just Observation qualifies you to give Advice the best of any Man I know And I appeal to your own Experience whether Marriage be not a state of Life attended with innumerable Cares Disappointments and Inquietudes  Wel  'Tis true I have found it so and you by your living so many Years in my House in your Youth was frequently an Eyewitness  witness of this sad Truth And I farther confess that my secret Troubles which were the greater for being so far exceeded all that ever were visible but those are not essential to a married State but might have been prevented by a more prudent Choice But as it was one darling Child not only made them easy but far o'erpaid them all Tho' Heaven knows that Child is now my greatest Trouble    Aside  Sir John  It is not the Lot of every Man to be Father to a  Silvia  The ill Conveniences of Marriage are certain the Advantages precarious therefore I determine to persevere in my Freedom  AIR XXXIX A Country Life is sweet  Free from Confinement and Strife  I'll plow thro' the Ocean of Life  To seek new Delights  Where Beauty invites  But ne'er be confin'd to a Wife  The Man that is free  Like a Vessel at Sea  After Conquest and Plunder may roam  But when either's confin'd  By Wife or by Wind  Tho' for Glory design'd  No Advantage they find  But rot in the Harbour at home  Wel  How falsely do you reason Lewdness is a Gulph which swallows up the Lives and Fortunes of all who venture into it And such will be your Fate if you pursue the Course you are now ingag'd in  Sir John  I shall run the Hazard spite of your wise Admonitions  Wel  At your own Peril be it then Have I suppress'd my just Resentment thus long to expostulate with thee for this You would be thought a Man of Humanity and Honourwas not your late villanous Attempt upon my Daughter's Virtue a notorious Instance of both Nay Sir you may start and frown and bite your Lips if you pleaseI repeat it again your villanous Attempt  Sir John  Considering who I am and what you are supposing I had been to blame 'twou'd have become you to have cloath'd your Complaints in softer Language  Wel  No Words are strong enough to express your Baseness and my Wrongs  Sir John  Had the worst you seem to apprehend been accomplish'd  Wel  Confound thy prophane Tongue for such a Supposition  Sir John  Your Insolence and Outrage would tire the Patience of an Angel Is not your Daughter virtuous and chast as ever  Wel  The Excellency of her Virtue whom you would have ruin'd but aggravates thy Guilt  Sir John  The mighty Ruin you talk of was but to have devoted my Life and Fortune to her Pleasure which sure was sufficient to have kept her from Contempt and her Beauty would still have been as much admir'd as ever  Wel  After the Loss of Virtue Beauty and Fortune like a fair and sumptuous Monument erected upon a bad Man's Grave serve only to perpetuate Infamy and make it more extensive  Sir John  What is it that you'd wish your Daughter  Wel  I wish her Innocence Peace Fortune with Fame on Earth and Everlasting Happiness hereafter but you'd make them all impossible to her  Sir John  She may still be happy  Wel  And shall in spite of thee Fond Fool that I was I thought to have made you the happy Instrument to have advanced her to that Lustre and Rank in Life her Merit claims but you have render'd your self unworthy of that Happiness and Honour and notwithstanding all my Dotage on thee you now force me to curse the Parent that begot thee the Womb that bore thee and the Hour that gave thee to the Light for thou hast added to the Wrongs of  Silvia  hast pierc'd her Heart with new unthought of SorrowsI have seen her flowing Tears heard her sad Sighs and soft Complaints for thy Ingratitude unworthy as thou art  Sir John  O  Welford  Father did she weep and sigh for me O let me fly to throw me at her Feet I cannot bear to  hear her Sorrows told But oh to see hersurely I shall die with Tenderness before her I could not have thought I had been so happy or so wretched  AIR XL Draw  Cupid  draw  Reign  Silvia  Reign  The Rebel quits his Arms  Your Power's compleat  And I submit  To your Victorious Charms  The pleasing

to return  But O I fear  Too fierce to bear  The mighty Joy will be  And Love's keen Dart  Fixt in my Heart  Prove that of Death to me  Wel  Whither would you go  Sir John  Whither but to  Silvia  to  Silvia  much wrong'd but more belov'd to the loving mourning  Silvia    Wel  To what end  Sir John  To implore her Pardon to expell her Griefs to vow eternal Love eternal Truth  Wel  And if she

unhappy Son  Sir John  Did not you call me Son O that I were To be your Son is all the Happiness my Soul aspires to  Wel  Too soon you'll find that Name includes the worst of Miseries certain DespairBut to the Business of my coming  SCENE XXI  Sir  John Silvia Welford Goody Busy Goody Costive Jonathan Betty  c    Wel  Goody  Busy  and the rest of my Friends who came with me pray walk in Now let all here attend and witness to the Truths I am about to utter and you unhappy Youth prepare to bear the most surprizing Change of Fortune like a ManYou are not whom you seem and whom you think your self Sir  John Freeman  Baronet and rightful Possessor of a fair Estate but an innocent Impostor and Usurper of another's Right and my unhappy Son indeed  Sil  What can my Father mean  G Busy  This is the strangest Story that ever I heard of  Sir John  Welford  to invent a Tale so vile and so absurd to make me despair of  Silvia  as being her Brother is unworthy of your good Sense and former Probity  Wel  I will not thank you for your Assent to the Truth of what I affirm This excellent Lady is not my Daughter but the much wrong'd  Angelica Freeman  the sole surviving Child of the late Sir  John Freeman  and Heiress to his large EstateI read Wonder and Surprize in every FaceYou look for ProofsGoody  Busy  you serv'd Sir  John Freeman  's Lady and my Wife as Midwife  G Busy  That I did to be sure  Wel  How many Children had each  G Busy  Two a Son and a Daughter I shall never forget it they Layin both times together and your Wife nurs'd both Sir  John  's Children  Wel  All this is true but was there any thing remarkable upon the Body of Sir  John  's Son when born  G Busy  No but yours was mark'd under the left Breast with a bunch of Grapes the Fruit Leaves and Stalks all in their proper Shape and Colour as if they had been growing on the Vine  Sir John    Opening his Breast    Here is the indelible Mark visible and fair as when the Seal of Heaven imprest it first to distinguish the Impostor from the rightful Heir  Wel  Too well I know it  Sil  If this Gentleman be your Son how could his Birth have been conceal'd so long  Wel  Thatwith my own Shame I am now to discoverMy Wife while unmarry'd attended on the Mother of this Lady then a Virgin and so far was she honour'd with her Confidence that she liv'd with her rather as a Sister or Companion than a Servant after her Marriage to Sir  John  and my Wife's to me the Honour of their Friendship was continu'd for I was happy in Sir  John  's as my Wife was in his Lady'sThat we had the same number of Children and of the same Age and Sex and that my Wife was entrusted with the Care of theirs you have heard alreadySoon after the Birth of this Lady a War breaking out Sir  John  who had an honourable Post in the Army went for  Flanders  I attended him thither and as I had formerly done serv'd under him as a VoluntierIn this our Absence a Fever made dreadful Ravage in this part of the CountryOf it dy'd Sir  John  's Lady and quickly after his Son who was then at my House and my DaughterMy Wife taking the Advantage of the Lady's Death and our Absence reported that the Son who dy'd was ours and the surviving one truly ours was Sir  John  'sOur Daughter who dy'd was bury'd as his and his this Lady was reputed and educated as our ownThe Fraud was never so much as suspected by Sir  John  nor any other Person my self exceptedI indeed by Observations which none else had opportunity to make soon found it out and charg'd my Wife with it she confess'd it and to my Shame prevail'd upon me to conceal what I could never approveShe dy'd before Sir  John  and never liv'd to see her Son possess'd of the Honour and Wealth which she by such wicked Means had endeavour'd to procure for himThro' Heav'n's Mercy I hope she rests in Peace But what have been my Tortures e'er since I consented to conceal the  guilty SecretStung hourly with Remorse I attempted to do her Justice and conceal my Shame by effecting a Marriage between her and my Son but Heaven that refus'd the imperfect Satisfaction and condemn'd the Fraud has you see made vain the fond Attempt nor would suffer her to receive that as another's Gift which is her own proper Right  Sir John  And long may she enjoy itI have not so ill profited by her bright Example as to repine at a Change of Fortune so just and so much to the Advantage of this wondrous Pattern of all that's excellent in Womankind  Sil  Your Justice and the Moderation of your Son affects me more than these unthought of undesired Riches can I ever forget your more than paternal Kindness and Affection  Wel  Spare me the Confusion that your Goodness gives me look not so tenderly nor speak so kindly but treat me as your Injuries and my Crimes deserve  Sil  The Crime was another'sYour former Tenderness and present Justice tho' to the Disadvantage of your Son is all your ownIf you forsake me now I am indeed an OrphanRiches have Snares and Youth without a Guide is expos'd to many DangersBe still my Father  Wel  Thy own worthy Father were he living could never love thee moreBut to be thy Father is impossible  Sil  This is your SonLet me be his and you are still my Father  Sir John  Do I indeed behold her heavenly Face all clad in Smiles and kindly bent on me Do I indeed hear her harmonious Voice pronounce me happyOr does my flatt'ring Fancy to sooth Despair form Images that have no real Existence  Wel  Bless her bless her Heaven and as you have made her the best make her the happiest of her SexNever did I tast Joys sincere till now  Sil  This surprizing Discovery unmadehad I consented to have been yoursthe Disinterestedness of my Love and Virtue could never have been knownHeaven has made our Duty and our Interest one I may now without Reproach give my Hand where before I had given my Heart  Betty  Weeps    Jon  What in Tears  Betty  Betty  What have I lost for want of reflecting sooner I'd rather have that Lady's Virtue than her Beauty and Estate  Jon  Poor GirlWhy this is to have itI remember on a certain Occasion I made you a Promise of Marriage if you think it worth claiming give me your Hand  Betty  There it is if you can

Sincerity that I confess my self concern'd for the Distress brought upon an honest Man and his Family by my Folly  Sil  Your Concern is just and generous like the Man I hope ever to find youbut have I
