 Mr Garrick  A  Fine Gentleman  Mr Woodward  Mr  Tatoo  Mr King  Old Man  Mr Taswell  Taylor  Mr Yates  Mrs  Riot  Mrs Clive  Mrs  Tatoo  Mrs Green  LETHE  SCENE a Grove  With a View of the River Lethe  CHARON  and  AESOP  discover'd  CHARON  _PRITHEE Philosopher what grand Affair is transacting upon Earth There is something of Importance going forward I am sure for  Mercury  flew over the  Styx  this Morning without paying me the usual Compliments  Aesop  I'll tell thee  Charon  this is the Anniversary of the Rape of  Proserpine  on which Day for the future  Pluto  has permitted her to demand from him something for the Benefit of Mankind  Char  I understand youhis Majesty's Passions by a long Possession of the Lady are abated and so like a mere Mortal he must now flatter her Vanity and sacrifice his Power to attone for DeficienciesBut what has our Royal Mistress proposed in behalf of her favourite Mortals  Aesop  As Mankind you know are ever complaining of their Cares and dissatisfied with their Conditions the generous  Proserpine  has begg'd of  Pluto  that they may have free Access to the Waters of  Lethe  as a sovereign Remedy for their Complaints Notice has been already given above and Proclamation made  Mercury  is to conduct them to the  Styx  you are to ferry 'em over to  Elysium  and I am placed here to distribute the Waters  Char  A very pretty Employment I shall have of it truly If her Majesty has often these Whims I must petition the Court either to build a Bridge over the River or let me resign my Employment Do their Majesties know the Difference of Weight between Souls and Bodies However I'll obey their Commands to the best of my Power I'll row my crazy Boat over and meet 'em but many of them will be relieved from their Cares before they reach  Lethe  Aesop  How so  Charon  Char  Why I shall leave half of 'em in the  Styx  and any Water is a Specifick against Care provided it be taken in Quantity  Enter  Mercury  Mer  Away to your Boat  Charon  there are some Mortals arriv'd and the Females among 'em will be very clamorous if you make 'em wait  Cha  I'll make what Haste I can rather than give those fair Creatures a Topick for Conversation  Noise within Boat Boat Boat  ComingcomingZounds you are in a plaguy Hurry sureNo wonder these mortal Folks have so many Complaints when there's no Patience among 'em if they were dead now and to be settled here for ever they'd be damn'd before they'd make such a Rout to come overbut Care I suppose is thirsty and 'till they have drench'd themselves with  Lethe  there will be no Quiet among 'em therefore I'll e'en to work and so Friend  Aesop  and Brother  Mercury  good bye to 'ye  Exit  Charon  Aesop  Now to my Office of Judge and Examiner in which to the best of my Knowledge I will act with Impartiality for I will immediately relieve real Objects and only divert myself with Pretenders  Mer  Act as your Wisdom directs and conformable to your earthly Character and we shall have few Murmurers  Aesop  I still retain my former Sentiments never to refuse Advice or Charity to those that want either Flattery and Rudeness should be equally avoided Folly and Vice should never be spared and tho' by acting thus you may offend many yet you will please the better few and the Approbation of one virtuous Mind is more valuable than all the noisy Applause and uncertain Favours of the Great and Guilty  Mer  Incomparable  Aesop  both Men and Gods admire thee We must now prepare to receive these Mortals and lest the Solemnity of the Place shou'd strike 'em with too much Dread I'll raise Musick shall dispel their Fears and embolden them to approach  SONG  I  Ye Mortals whom Fancies and Troubles perplex  Whom Folly misguides and Infirmities vex  Whose Lives hardly know what it is to be blest  Who rise without Joy and lie down without Rest  Obey the glad Summons to  Lethe  repair  Drink deep of the Stream and forget all your Care  II  Old Maids shall forget what they wish for in vain  And young ones the Rover they cannot regain  The Rake shall forget how last Night he was cloy'd  And  Cloe  again be with Passion enjoy'd  Obey then the Summons to  Lethe  repair  And drink an Oblivion to Trouble and Care  III  The Wife at one Draught may forget all her Wants  Or drench her fond Fool to forget her Gallants  The troubled in Mind shall go chearful away  And Yesterday's Wretch be quite happy today  Obey then the Summons to  Lethe  repair  Drink deep of the Stream and forget all your Care  Aesop  Mercury    Charon  has brought over one Mortal already conduct him hither  Exit  Mercury  Now for a large Catalogue of Complaints without the Acknowledgment of one single Vicehere he comesif one may guess at his Cares by his Appearance he really wants the Assistance of  Lethe  Enter  Poet  Poet  Sir your humble Servantyour humble Servantyour Name is  Aesop  I know your Person intimately tho' I never saw you before and am well acquainted with you tho' I never had the Honour of your Conversation  Aesop  You are a Dealer in Paradoxes Friend  Poet  I am a Dealer in all Parts of Speech and in all the Figures of RhetorickI am a Poet Sirand to be a Poet and not acquainted with the great  Aesop  is a greater Paradox thanI honour you extremely Sir you certainly of all the Writers of Antiquity had the greatest the sublimest Genius the  Aesop  Hold Friend I hate Flattery  Poet  My own Taste exactlyI assure you Sir no Man loves Flattery less than myself  Aesop  So it appears Sir by your being so ready to give it away  Poet  You have hit it Mr  Aesop  you have hit itI have given it away indeedI did not receive one Farthing for my last Dedication and yet would you believe itI absolutely gave all the Virtues in Heav'n to one of the lowest Reptiles upon Earth  Aesop  'Tis hard indeed to do dirty Work for nothing  Poet  Ay Sir to do dirty Work and still be dirty oneself is the Stone of  Sysiphus  and the Thirst of  Tantalus  You  Greek  Writers indeed carried your Point by Truth and Simplicity they won't do now adaysour Patrons must be tickled into Generosityyou gain'd the greatest Favours by shewing your own Merits we can only gain the smallest by publishing those of other PeopleYou flourish'd by Truth we starve by Fiction  Tempora mutantur  Aesop  Indeed Friend if we may guess by your present Plight you have prostituted your Talents to very little Purpose  Poet  To very little upon my wordbut they shall find that I can open another Vein Satire is the Fashion and Satire they shall havelet 'em look to it I can be sharp as well as sweetI can scourge as well as tickle I can bite as  Aesop  You can do any thing no doubt but to the Business of this Visit for I expect a great deal of CompanyWhat are your Troubles Sir  Poet  Why Mr  Aesop  I am troubled with an odd kind of a DisorderI have a sort of a Whistlinga Singinga Whizzing as it were in my Head which I cannot get rid of  Aesop  Our Waters give no Relief to bodily Disorders they only affect the Memory  Poet  From whence all my Disorder proceeds I'll tell you my Case Sir You must know I wrote a Play some time ago presented a Dedication of it to a certain young NoblemanHe approv'd and accepted of it but before I could taste his Bounty my Piece was unfortunately damn'd I lost my Benefit nor could I have Recourse to my Patron for I was told that his Lordship play'd the best Catcall the first Night and was the merriest Person in the whole Audience  Aesop  Pray what do you call damning a Play  Poet  You cannot possibly be ignorant what it is to be damn'd Mr  Aesop  Aesop  Indeed I am SirWe had no such thing among the  Greeks  Poet  No SirNo Wonder then that you  Greeks  were such fine WritersIt is impossible to be describ'd or truly felt but by the Author himselfIf you could but get a Leave of Absence from this World for a few Hours you might perhaps have an Opportunity of seeing it yourselfThere is a Sort of a new Piece comes upon our Stage this very Night and I am pretty sure it will meet with its Deserts at least it shall not want my helping Hand rather than you should be disappointed of satisfying your Curiosity  Aesop  You are very obliging Sirbut to your own Misfortunes if you please  Poet  Envy Malice and Party destroy'd meYou must know Sir I was a great Damner myself before I was damn'dSo the Frolicks of my Youth were return'd to me with double Interest from my Brother AuthorsBut to say the Truth my Performance was terribly handled before it appear'd in publick  Aesop  How so pray  Poet  Why Sir some squeamish Friends of mine prun'd it of all the Bawdy and Immorality the Actors did not speak a Line of the Sense or Sentiment and the Manager who writes himself struck out all the Wit and Humour in order to lower my Performance to a Level with his own  Aesop  Now Sir I am acquainted with your Case what have you to propose  Poet  Notwithstanding the Success of my first Play I am strongly persuaded that my next may defy the Severity of Criticks the Sneer of Wits and the Malice of Authors  Aesop  What have you been hardy enough to attempt another  Poet  I must eat SirI must livebut when I sit down to write and am glowing with the Heat of my Imagination thenthis damn'd Whistlingor Whizzing in my Head that I told you of so disorders me that I grow giddyIn short Sir I am  haunted as it were with the Ghost of my deceas'd Play and its dying Groans are for ever in my EarsNow Sir if you will give me but a Draught of  Lethe  to forget this unfortunate Performance it will be of more real Service to me than all the Waters of  Helicon  Aesop  I doubt Friend you cannot possibly write better by merely forgetting that you have written before besides if when you drink to the Forgetfulness of your own Works you should unluckily forget those of other People too your next Piece will certainly be the worse for it  Poet  You are certainly in the right What then would you advise me to  Aesop  Suppose you could prevail upon the Audience to drink the Water their forgetting your former Work might be of no small Advantage to your future Productions  Poet  Ah Sir if I could but do that but I am afraid  Lethe  will never go down with the Audience  Aesop  Well since you are bent upon it I shall indulge youIf you please to walk in that Grove which will afford you many Subjects for your poetical Contemplation till I have examin'd the rest I will dismiss you in your Turn  Poet  And I in return Sir will let the World know in a Preface to my next Piece that your Politeness is equal to your Sagacity  and that you are as much the fine Gentleman as the Philosopher  Exit  Poet  Aesop  Oh your Servant SirIn the Name of Misery and Mortality what have we here  Enter an  Old Man  supported by a  Servant  Old Man  Oh la oh bless me I shall never recover the FatigueHa what are you Friend Are you the famous  Aesop  And are you so kind so very good to give People the Waters of Forgetfulness for nothing  Aesop  I am that Person Sir but you seem to have no need of my Waters for you must have already outliv'd your Memory  Old Man  My Memory is indeed impair'd it is not so good as it was but still it is better than I wish it at least in regard to one Circumstance there is one Thing which sits very heavy at my Heart and which I would willingly forget  Aesop  What is it pray  Old Man  Oh laohI am horribly fatiguedI am an old Man Sir turn'd of NinetyWe are all mortal you know so I would fain forget if you pleasethat I am to die  Aesop  My good Friend you have mistaken the Virtue of the Waters They can cause  you to forget only what is past but if this was in their Power you would surely be your own Enemy in desiring to forget what ought to be the only Comfort of one so poor and wretched as you seem What I suppose now you have left some dear loving Wife behind that you can't bear to think of parting with  Old Man  No no no I have buried my Wife and forgot her long ago  Aesop  What you have Children then whom you are unwilling to leave behind you  Old Man  No no I have no Children at presenthughI don't know what I may have  Aesop  Is there any Relation or Friend the Loss of whom  Old Man  No no I have outlived all my Relations and as for FriendsI have none to lose  Aesop  What can be the Reason then that in all this apparent Misery you are so afraid of Death which would be your only Cure  Old Man  Oh LordI have one Friend and a true Friend indeed the only Friend in whom a wise Man places any ConfidenceI haveGet a little farther off  John    Servant retires  I have to say the Truth a little Money it is that indeed which causes all my Uneasiness  Aesop  Thou never spok'st a truer Word in thy Life old Gentleman  Aside  But I can cure you of your Uneasiness immediately  Old Man  Shall I forget then that I am to die and leave my Money behind me  Aesop  Nobut you shall forget that you have itwhich will do altogether as well One large Draught of  Lethe  to the Forgetfulness of your Money will restore you to perfect Ease of Mind and as for your bodily Pains no Waters can relieve them  Old Man  What does he say  John  eh I am hard of Hearing  John  He advises your Worship to drink to forget your Money  Old Man  Whatwhatwill his Drink get me Money does he say  Aesop  No Sir the Waters are of a wholsomer Naturefor they'll teach you to forget your Money  Old Man  Will they soCome come  John  we are got to the wrong Place The pool old Fool here does not know what he saysLet us go back again  John  I'll drink none of your Waters not I Forget my Money Come along  John  Exeunt  Aesop  Was there ever such a Wretch If these are the Cares of Mortals the Waters of Oblivion cannot cure them  Reenter  Old Man  and  Servant  Old Man  Lookee Sir I am come a great Way and am loth to refuse Favours that cost nothingso I don't care if I drink a little of your WatersLet me seeayI'll drink to forget how I  got  my Money And my Servant there he shall drink a little to forget that I have any Money at alland d'ye hear  John  take a hearty Draught If my Money must be forgot why e'en let  him  forget it  Aesop  Well Friend it shall be as you would have itYou'll find a Seat in that Grove yonder where you may rest yourself till the Waters are distributed  Old Man  I hope it won't be long Sir for Thieves are busy nowand I have an Iron Chest in the other World that I should be sorry any one peep'd into but myself So pray be quick Sir  Exeunt  Aesop  Patience Patience old Gentleman But here comes something tripping this Way that seems to be neither Man nor Woman and yet an odd Mixture of both  Enter a  Fine  Gentleman  Fine Gent  Harkee old Friend do you stand Drawer here  Aesop  Drawer young Fop Do you know where you are and who you talk to  Fine Gent  Not I dem me But 'tis a Rule with me wherever I am or whoever I am with to be always easy and familiar  Aesop  Then let me advise you young Gentleman to drink the Waters and forget that Ease and Familiarity  Fine Gent  Why so Daddy wou'd you not have me well bred  Aesop  Yes but you may not always meet with People so polite as yourself or so passive as I am and if what you call Breeding shou'd be constru'd Impertinence you may have a Return of Familiarity may make you repent your Education as long as you live  Fine Gent  Well said old Drybeard egad you have a Smattering of an odd kind of a sort of a Humour but come come prithee give me a Glass of your Waters and keep your Advice to yourself  Aesop  I must first be informed Sir for what Purpose you drink 'em  Fine Gent  You must know Philosopher I want to forget two QualitiesMy  Modesty  and my  Goodnature  Aesop  Your Modesty and Goodnature  Fine Gent  Yes SirI have such a consummate  Modesty  that when a fine Woman which is often the Case yields to my Addresses egad I run away from her and I am  so very  goodnatured  that when a Man affronts me egad I run away too  Aesop  As for your Modesty Sir I am afraid you are come to the wrong Waters and if you will take a large Cup to the Forgetfulness of your Fears your Goodnature I believe will trouble you no more  Fine Gent  And this is your Advice my Dear eh  Aesop  My Advice Sir would go a great deal fartherI should advise you to drink to the Forgetfulness of every thing you know  Fine Gent  The Devil you would then I should have travell'd to a fine Purpose truly you don't imagine perhaps that I have been three Years abroad and have made the Tour of  Europe  Aesop  Yes Sir I guess'd you had travell'd by your Dress and Conversation But pray with Submission what valuable Improvements have you made in these Travels  Fine Gent  Sir I learnt Drinking in  Germany  Musick and Painting in  Italy  Dancing Gaming and some other Amusements at  Paris  and in  Holland  faith nothing at all I brought over with me the best Collection of  Venetian  Ballads two Eunuchs a  French  Dancer and a Monkey with Toothpicks Pictures and BurlettasIn short I have skim'd the Cream of every Nation and have the Consolation to declare I never was in any  Country in my Life but I had Taste enough thoroughly to despise my own  Aesop  Your Country is greatly obliged to youbut if you are settled in it now how can your Taste and Delicacy endure it  Fine Gent  Faith my Existence is merely supported by Amusements I dress visit study Taste and write Sonnets by Birth Travel Education and natural Abilities I am entitled to lead the Fashion I am principal Connoisseur at all Auctions chief Arbiter at Assemblies profess'd Critick at the Theatres and a fine Gentlemanevery where  Aesop  Critick Sir pray what's that  Fine Gent  The Delight of the Ingenious the Terror of Poets the Scourge of Players and the Aversion of the Vulgar  Aesop  Pray Sir for I fancy your Life must be somewhat particular how do you pass your Time the Day for Instance  Fine Gent  I lie in Bed all Day Sir  Aesop  How do you spend your Evenings then  Fine Gent  I dress in the Evening and go generally behind the Scenes of both Playhouses not you may imagine to be diverted with the Play but to intrigue and shew myselfI stand upon the Stage talk loud and stare aboutwhich confounds the Actors and disturbs the Audience upon which the  Galleries who hate the Appearance of one of us begin to  hiss  and cry  off    off  while I undaunted stamp my Foot sololl with my Shoulder thustake Snuff with my Righthand and smile scornfullythusThis exasperates the Savages and they attack us with Vollies of suck'd Oranges and half eaten Pippins  Aesop  And you retire  Fine Gent  Without doubt if I am sober for Orange will stain Silk and an Apple may disfigure a Feature  Aesop  I am afraid Sir for all this that you are oblig'd to your own Imagination for more than three Fourths of your Importance  Fine Gent  Damn the old Prig I'll bully him  Aside  Lookee old Philosopher I find you have pass'd your Time so long in Gloom and Ignorance below here that our Notions above Stairs are too refined for you so as we are not likely to agree I shall cut Matters very short with youBottle me off the Waters I want or you shall be convinc'd that I have Courage in the drawing of a Corkdispatch me instantly or I shall make bold to throw you into the River and help myselfWhat say you to that now eh  Aesop  Very civil and concise I have no great Inclination to put your Manhood to the Trial so if you will be pleas'd to walk in the Grove there 'till I have examined  some I see coming we'll compromise the Affair between us  Fine Gent  Yours as you behaveau Revoir  Exit  Beau  Enter Mr and Mrs  Tatoo  Mrs Tatoo  Why don't you come along Mr  Tatoo  what the deuce are you afraid of  Aesop  Don't be angry young Lady the Gentleman is your Husband I suppose  Mrs Tat  How do you know that eh What you an't all Conjurers in this World are you  Aesop  Your Behaviour to him is a sufficient Proof of his Condition without the Gift of Conjuration  Mrs Tat  Why I was as free with him before Marriage as I am now I never was coy or prudish in my Life  Aesop  I believe you Madam pray how long have you been married you seem to be very young Lady  Mrs Tat  I am old enough for a Husband and have been married long enough to be tired of one  Aesop  How long pray  Mrs Tat  Why above three Months I married Mr  Tatoo  without my Guardians Consent  Aesop  If you married him with your own Consent I think you might continue your Affections a little longer  Mrs Tat  What signifies what you think if I don't think soWe are quite tired of one another and are come to drink some of your LeLethalyLeithily I think they call it to forget one another and be unmarried again  Aesop  The Waters can't divorce you Madam and you may easily forget him without the Assistance of  Lethe  Mrs Tat  Ay how so  Aesop  By remembering continually he is your Husband there are several Ladies have no other ReceiptBut what does the Gentleman say to this  Mrs Tat  What signifies what he says I an't so young and so foolish as that comes to to be directed by my Husband or to care what either he says or you say  Mr Tat  Sir I was a Drummer in a Marching Regiment when I ran away with that young LadyI immediately bought out of the Corps and thought myself made for ever little imagining that a poor vain Fellow was purchasing Fortune at the Expence of his Happiness  Aesop  'Tis even so Friend Fortune and Felicity are as often at Variance as Man and Wife  Mr Tat  I found it so SirThis high Life as I thought it did not agree with me I have not laugh'd and scarcely slept since my Advancement and unless your Wisdom can alter her Notions I must e'en quit the Blessings of a fine Lady and her Portion and for Content have Recourse to Eightpence a Day and my Drum again  Aesop  Pray who has advis'd you to a Separation  Mrs Tat  Several young Ladies of my Acquaintance who tell me they are not angry at me for marrying him but being fond of him now I have married him and they say I should be as compleat a fine Lady as any of 'em if I would but procure a  separate Divorcement  Aesop  Pray Madam will you let me know what you call a fine Lady  Mrs Tat  Why a fine Lady and a fine Gentleman are two of the finest Things upon Earth  Aesop  I have just now had the Honour of knowing what a fine Gentleman is so pray confine yourself to the Lady  Mrs Tat  A fine Lady before Marriage lives with her Papa and Mama who breed her up till she learns to despise 'em and resolves to do nothing they bid her this makes her such a prodigious Favourite that she wants for nothing  Aesop  So Lady  Mrs Tat  When once she is her own Mistress then comes the Pleasure  Aesop  Pray let us hear  Mrs Tat  She lies in Bed all Morning rattles about all Day and sits up all Night she goes every where and sees every thing knows every body and loves no body ridicules her Friends coquets with her Lovers sets 'em together by the Ears tells Fibs makes Mischief buys China cheats at Cards keeps a Pugdog and hates the Parsons she laughs much talks aloud never blushes says what she will does what she will goes where she will marries whom she pleases hates her Husband in a Month breaks his Heart in four becomes a Widow slips from her Gallants and begins the World again There's a Life for you What do you think of a fine Lady now  Aesop  As I expectedyou are very young Lady and if you are not very careful your natural Propensity to Noise and Affectation will run you headlong into Folly Extravavagance and Repentance  Mrs Tat  What would you have me do  Aesop  Drink a large Quantity of  Lethe  to the Loss of your Acquaintance and do you Sir drink another to forget this false Step of your Wife for whilst you remember her Folly you can never thoroughly regard her and whilst you keep good Company Lady  as you call it and follow their Example you can never have a just Regard for your Husband so both drink and be happy  Mrs Tat  Well give it me whilst I am in Humour or I shall certainly change my Mind again  Aesop  Be patient till the rest of the Company drink and divert yourself in the mean time with walking in the Grove  Mrs Tat  Well come along Husband and keep me in Humour or I shall beat you such an Alarum as you never beat in all your Life  Exeunt Mr and Mrs  Tattoo  Enter  Frenchman  singing  French  Monsieur votre Serviteurpourquoi ne repondez vous pasJe dis que je suis votre Serviteur

chiefly takes Root in a barren Soil  Tay  I am sure my Head is full of nothing else  Aesop  But how came you to a Knowledge of your Misfortune has not your Wife as much Wit as you  Tay  A great deal more Sir and that is one Reason for my believing myself dishonour'd  Aesop  Tho' your Reason has some Weight in it yet it does not amount to a Conviction  Tay  I have more to say for myself if your Worship will but hear me  Aesop  I shall attend to you  Tay  My Wife has such very High Blood in her that she is lately turn'd Papist and is always railing at me and the Government The Priest and she are continually laying their Heads together and I am afraid he has persuaded her that it will save her precious Soul if she cuckolds a Heretick Taylor  Aesop  Oh don't think so hardly of 'em  Tay  Lord Sir you don't know what Tricks are going forward above Religion indeed is the Outside Stuff but Wickedness is the Lining  Aesop  Why you are in a Passion Friend if you would but exert yourself thus at a proper Time you might keep the Fox from your Poultry  Tay  Lord Sir my Wife has as much Passion again as I have and whenever she's up I curb my Temper sit down and say nothing  Aesop  What Remedy have you to propose for this Misfortune  Tay  I would propose to dip my Head in the River to wash away my Fanciesand if you'll let me take a few Bottles to my Wife if the Water is of a cooling Nature I may perhaps be easy that Way but I shall do as your Worship pleases  Aesop  I am afraid this Method won't answer Friend suppose therefore you drink to forget your Suspicions for they are nothing more and let your Wife drink to forget your UneasinessA mutual Confidence will succeed and consequently mutual Happiness  Tay  I have such a Spirit I can never bear to be dishonour'd in my Bed

Aesop  What's the Matter  Cha  There are some Ladies who have been disputing so long and so loud about taking Place and Precedency that they have set their Relations a tilting at one another to support their Vanity The Standersby are some of them so frighted and some of them so diverted at the Quarrel that they have not time to think of their Misfortunes so I e'en left them to settle their Prerogatives by themselves and be Friends at their leisure  Mer  What's to be done  Aesop  Aesop  Discharge these we have and finish the Business of the Day  Enter  Drunken Man  and Mrs  Riot  D Man
