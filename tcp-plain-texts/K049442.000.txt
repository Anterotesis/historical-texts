 THE  Fifteen COMFORTS  OF A ScotchMan Written by  Daniel D' Foe  in  Scotland  LONDON Printed in the Year MDCCVII  THE Fifteen Comforts c  The First Comfort  BE Dumb ye Beggars of the Rhiming Trade  Geld the  ose Wits and let the Muse be Splaid  Charge not the Parish with the Bastard Phrase  Of  Balm Elixar  both the  India  's  Of  Shrine Saint Sacriledge  and such as these  Expressions common as their Mistresses  Of her I write no Pen can reach her Worth  Nor find an Epithet to set her forth  I mean Heroick  Anne  our Gracious Queen  In War Victorious and in Pomp Serene  The Circle of whose Reign contains all Bliss  And daily studies  Scotland  's Happiness  The Second Comfort  Now Sacred  Anne  does wear the  British  Crown  The Church does flourish and is lofty grown  The Laws are risen from a long long Trance  And our uniting is a Check to  France  Which Union even would make our Foes Baptize  Themselves all Converts in our watry Eyes  Which we for very Joy do weep to see  How  Anne  designs to make Posterity  or ever happy whilst She's on the Throne  n making  Scots  and  English  both as One  The Third Comfort  Among the num'rous Throng we  Scots  do come  To wish the grand Support of  Christendom  Health that's the Joy of Life and Soul of Mirth  Bane of  and Comfort of our Birth  May't with your Years as clearly last and rise  As 'twas e'er Winds had blasted Paradise  Wealth the Support of Pleasure and the Crown  The only Prop of Glory and Renown  May the same virtuous Temper the same Fire  That never flags too low nor do's mount higher  Enflame your Breast and to't by Heaven be sent  That which all seek but find not true Content  May all your Aims atchieve their purpos'd End  Then Loyal  Scotland  ne'er will want a Friend  To be the Guardian of their Church and State  Whilst the  Rose  and  Thistle  do incorporate  The Fourth Comfort  Poor lousie beggar'd  France  halfstarv'd  Spain  Durst not presume t' appear upon the Main  For now St  Andrew  and St  George  do joyn  Upon the Ocean they'll in Glory shine  Whose UnionColours on the rolling Sea  Will shew the Force of  British  Heraldry  Thus on that Element the  Scots  too Fame  Will get and to tho encient  Scottish  Name  Will Honour add by having such a Fleet  That durst our Foe upon the Ocean meet  And make them low'r their Topsails too at Sea  As owning that the only Sovereignty  Thereof is Sacred  Anna  's Lawful Right  For which Her Loyal Subjects too will Fight  The Fifth Comfort  In a  Protestant  Succession now the Crown  Is fix'd and none must mount the  British  Throne  But what will the reformed Faith defend  And to the Church of  England  be a Friend  For by her Grandeur we supported be  Whilst Conscience do's enjoy its Liberty  And that which also gives our Hearts Content  As that two Nations has one Parliament  The Sixth Comfort  As to our Comforts what can more be said  Freedom we have and Intercourse of Trade  To any Port or Place the Kingdom round  Besides all  Scottish  Ships that shall be found  At Signing of this Treaty on the Sea  Of any sort of Foreign Built shall be  As Ships of the Built of  GreatBritain  deem'd  So much is  Scotland  by the Queen esteem'd  That Her Indulgence makes us all conspire  To act and to comply with Her Desire  The Seventh Comfort  Now now old  Scotland  is for ever made  Since with the  English  in the way of Trade  We have the same Allowances Restitutions  Lawful Encouragements and Prohibitions  No Article the Loyal  Scots  do blame  For Excise with us as you is all the same  For seven Years we shall be Dutyfree  In making Salt and farthermore we see  The LandTax will be very easie here  The Yoak is light for any one to bear  The Eighth Comfort  Duties on Paper Stamp'd we shall not pay  Nor Duties which they do on Velome lay  And farther to confirm us in our Rights  We shall no Duty pay for WindowLights  Nay Royal Favours still are more enlarg'd  For Coals consum'd at Home we shan't be charg'd  Nor charg'd with any Duty laid on Malt  So if we won't unite 'tis all our Fault  Both Nations will be one and we shall be  To all Intents as  Englishmen  Sir free  All Animosities being laid aside  In Love and Unity we shall take Pride  And in Eternal Friendship so dispose  Our selves as to be dreadful to our Foes  The Ninth Comfort  One  British  Parliament will now be made  And we have an Equivalent in Trade  The Coin of the united Kingdoms too  Be all alike that all may have their Due  Our Weights and Measures too must be the same  That People may not diff'rent Measures b lame  The Tenth Comfort  The Laws concerning regulating Trade  In favour of our Constitution's made  The Court of Sessions must the same remain  As formerly in this the present Reign  All Misdemeanours done upon the Sea  To be subject to the  British  Admiralty  Nay further to encrease our Happiness  Men Offices for Life may still possess  And yet to make us happy o'er again  The Queen is pleas'd that all the Rights remain  Of Royal  Scottish  Burroughs as they now  At present are What more can She allow  Or we from Royal Bounty still require  Since we have all as Subjects can desire  The Eleventh Comfort  We shall have Lords and Commons too to sit  In Parliament where're the Queen thinks fit  Who will have all the Priviledges too  That's really to their noble Peerage due  The same as  English  Peers they will enjoy  Which Treaty will the Hopes of  France  destroy  And that in time we may our Breaches heal  GreatBritain  must but use one only Seal  Quartered with those Arms as best may sure  This Union which makes  ANNA  absolute  Empress Imperial over the Bless'd Realm  Of which She does so wisely rule the Helm  The Twelfth Comfort  All Laws and Statutes in each Realm so far  As to the Union they contrary are  From and after it they cease and shall be void  That Liberty by us may be enjoy'd  What can we then of  England  ask for more  No greater Blessings they can have in store  Than what are granted so let's all sit down  And drink the Health of  Anne  who wears the Crown  And wish Her long to Reign that She may be  A Terror to the  Gallick  Monarchy  The Thirteenth Comfort  The  Scottish  Parliament has done their best  That these two Kingdoms may be doubly blest  Upon the  English  Parliament we wait  With low Submission for to know our Fate  Hoping kind Heav'n will cause them to agree  To this long wish'd and hop'd for Unity  Which surely will prove of such Consequence  That it will be a Thorn i' th' side of  France  And make them rue the Day that e'er we came  To be a People of one Crown and Name  For our uniting makes the  Frenchmen  fear  Some dreadful Storm's to them approaching near  The Fourteenth Comfort  Now now the  Scots  with  England  do unite  Lewis  and  Maintenon  are in a Fright  Ye  Spaniards  too your drooping Kingdom drench  Till Tears the Flames of  Purgatory  quench  But you that can't cry yet would seem to weep  Your Hankerchiefs in Holy Water steep  Then Virgin  Mary  and the Saints invoke  To keep your Kingdom from the  Frenchmen  Yoke  But if ye'll still be Fools and will not own  King  Charles  by Force we'll put on him a Crown  The Fifteenth Comfort  Glory and Honour Crown great  Anna  's N  And let her Greatness shine with endless Fam  For making such an Union that shall shake  Proud  France  and make its haughty Mon  qua  So whilst we Praises to our Sovereign give  Let's pray that  Anne  a  Nestor  's Age may live  FINIS
