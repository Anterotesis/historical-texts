PRINCE HOARE  LOVE'S VICTIMS THE  HERMIT's STORY  PART THE FIRST  CANTO I  "LEAVE Hermit leave these wilds forlorn  Cast off this garb of woe  With earliest gleam of opening morn  Thy guests prepare to go  With earliest gleam of opening morn  We'll spread the parting sail  Far hence o'er rolling surges born  Our native land to hail  For though in sore distress we came  To beg relief from thee  Yet not unknown to goodly fame  We plough the dang'rous sea  Beneath yon cliff's impending side  Within a secret bay  Our vessel proudly stems the tide  Our streamers lightly play  Then Hermit kind with us return  For this thy shelt'ring care  Thy former dwelling let us learn  We'll place thee safely there  "THIS lonely strand I'll ne'er forsake  Ne'er cast these weeds away  My thanks for offer'd service take  But leave me here to stay  Here till in death my limbs are cold  A sacred vow I'll keep  Full oft o'er yonder swelling mould  To pray to fast and weep  But though my vow forbid return  My native land to hail  Would you my former dwelling learn  I'll not refuse the tale  A tale of grief and blushing shame  My lips must then disclose  Yet so shall mem'ry keep my name  And pity mourn my woes  A sire of noble birth I own  On Rosay's fertile plain  No care his tranquil life had known  Unvex'd by grief or pain  Till Heav'n alas my sins ordain'd  To wake his virtuous rage  And shame unfelt before distain'd  The silver'd cheek of age  With him in social union bound  Earl Hubert long had been  Their youth the palm of friendship crown'd  And age beheld it green  "Now straight prepare your horsemen all"  Said the Earl "to go with me  "I have a feast in bow'r and hall  "Where you must shortly be"  "Set forth set forth" my sire replied  "Set forth without delay  "However fleetly you shall ride  "We'll pass you on the way  With me I'll bring my son along  "To grace your bow'r and hall  "And if he fail in dance or song  "On me the blame shall fall"  The minstrels play'd the hall was bright  The bow'r was fair to see  And there came many a noble knight  And maid of high degree  But 'midst those maidens all so fair  More fair than all was one  In peerless boast of beauty rare  The gentle Emma shone  Of humble birth she early mourn'd  A parent's shorten'd date  But heav'n to joy her grief had turn'd  And giv'n a kinder fate  The partner of Earl Hubert's breast  The helpless babe survey'd  And pity soft in tears confest  Bestow'd its bounteous aid  In rip'ning charms the nursling grew  And youth its lustre shed  Less fair the rose's blushing hue  When first its leaves are spread  Her eyes were as the diamond bright  But shone with temper'd ray  Like northern meteors that by night  O'er heav'n's pale azure play  Forgive these tears that still must flow  Ancor men' duol purch'io mene rimembri  DANTE INF  Whene'er the tale is told  For learn the beauteous maid lies low  Beneath yon swelling mould  CANTO II  WHEN youth beats high in ev'ry vein  And passion fires the mind  What can the wand'ring thought restrain  The lawless spirit bind  Too strong by reason to be sway'd  Desire my torment grew  For fair as Dian was the maid  But chaste as Dian too  How shall your virtuous ears endure  My guilty tongue repeat  What arts I us'd her love to lure  And watchful honor cheat  Too well I strove the maiden lov'd  Her devious steps I led  To duty lost we secret rov'd  And banish'd virtue fled  Illomen'd deed the hope how vain  Each social tie foregone  That constancy should yet remain  And faith intent on one  Who first pollutes the tender mind  And leads from truth astray  Ne'er let him hope again to find  The gem he casts away  The fatal change thus subtly wrought  I justly learnt to rue  Pleas'd with the freedom I had taught  To other loves she flew  Five lonely months my anxious fears  Her flight in vain explor'd  And oft my fondlyfalling tears  Her fancied death deplor'd  Oh Vanity that  Man  beguiles  Who boasts the stronger mind  In  Woman  's charms and native wiles  Defeat still doom'd to find  If haply here some list'ning guest  Have known like pains to prove  Let his consenting heart attest  How stoops our sex to Love  Before my gate in winter's cold  A trembling mourner stood  A tale of piteous want she told  And plaintive begg'd for food  Beneath that garb of friendless woe  My Emma stood confest  I clasp'd ere words had pow'r to flow  The wand'rer to my breast  I strove to chide but faintly blam'd  Then met her ardent kiss  Desire again my soul inflam'd  And hope renew'd my bliss  Fond pleasing dream too quickly o'er  The false one fled again  Amaz'd I griev'd but vow'd no more  To prize a heart so vain  Our angry vows Love turns to jest  While yet her loss I mourn'd  Again repentance touch'd her breast  Again the fair return'd  And while I view'd those fatal charms  Upon my neck she hung  To earth I shook her from my arms  Around my knees she clung  "Forgive the wretch" she suppliant cried  "The wretch thy flatt'ries made  Verbis capta Puella tuis OvEp  "By Pleasure's voice Ah faithless guide  "Too easily betray'd"  "With thee who taught'st me first to sin  Mentis prima ruina meae OvEp  "Let me my sins atone  "This let repentant anguish win  "To live with thee alone"  Thus o'er a bosom fondly soft  She triumph'd unrestrain'd  Oft from my arms she fled and oft  Those shelt'ring arms regain'd  So flitting on the summer's breeze  Delighted far to roam  The swallow born o'er smiling seas  Awhile forgets her home  But scar'd at sight of wintry gloom  When chilling blasts arise  With trembling wing and ruffled plume  Returns to friendlier skies  At length the destin'd hour was near  That rose to fix our fate  For still on folly's wild career  Chastising sorrows wait  Once when by lengthen'd absence tried  Love pour'd the weary tear  And hope her wonted aid denied  My fruitless search to cheer  It chanc'd at morn I bent my way  From Harfleur's lonely tow'rs  To where its tides in Havre's bay  The western ocean pours  There as I wander'd lost in thought  Faint notes of female cry  Hom Od  My ear with frequent wonder caught  And drew my curious eye  Far off advancing where I stood  A convict group I spied  Behind the fiends of pow'r pursued  Each ling'ring step to chide  By force compell'd the guilty band  Reluctant sought the shore  Whence doom'd to leave a forfeit land  And to return no more  Pitying I mark'd their hopeless lot  And heard their clanking chains  Their errors in their griefs forgot  Their vices in their pains  Nor thought while flow'd the ready tear  For sorrows not my own  My doom to share those griefs how near  And mingle groan with groan  As when dire phantoms of the night  Sleep's soft infoldment break  Up leaps the wretch in wild affright  And doubts if yet he wake  So rous'd at once with startling dread  Amid the guilty train  I saw my Emma captive led  And partner of their pain  The distant sight perhaps deceiv'd  With eager step I flew  Too soon I camenor yet believ'd  The horrid vision true  Nec tantum scelus esse putabam Ov Ep  To heav'n her eyes intent were cast  And pour'd a chrystal flood  The flinty pavement as she pass'd  Was mark'd with streaks of blood  I stood distracted and appall'd  Then faintly breath'd her name  Each wand'ring sense my voice recall'd  And shook her feeble frame  Her feeble frame no more sustains  Her eyes flash wildly round  She shrieksand sinking on her chains  Falls senseless to the ground  CANTO III  NEED I relate what cares I us'd  'Till sluggard life return'd  Or number all my pray'rs refus'd  Or tell her ransom spurn'd  Whether by daring guilt betray'd  Or fate severe opprest  I shunn'd to ask of truth afraid  Her anguish fill'd my breast  Doom'd to her cheerful native land  To bid a long adieu  And on a rude unpitying strand  Declining life pursue  "Unhappy fair whose fatal pow'r  "Enslaves my constant thought  "Behold in this disastrous hour  "The ruin thou hast wrought  "These tears this anguish is thine own  "That rends thy Albert's breast  "But tears with thee are pleasing grown  "And anguish lulls to rest  "Together on th' appointed plain  "We'll count the painful years  "Together drag the galling chain  "And mingle bitter tears"  "Forbear forbear" the suff'rer cried  And rais'd her languid head  "Thy hate thy vengeance I'll abide  "Thy constancy I dread  "Let mercy griev'd at length forsake  "A wretch to sorrow born  "Leave that obdurate heart to break  "Which  could  deserve thy scorn"  The tender pray'r I heard unmov'd  Or heard with soften'd heart  From her whom still alone I lov'd  Resolv'd no more to part  The swelling sails forbad delay  We left our native shore  O'er the blue waves the streamers play  And land is seen no more  Ah shade belov'd what wond'rous grief  Did then thy bosom know  While the fraught heart denied relief  And tears forbore to flow  Pale drooping o'er the billow's foam  I see thy form recline  Thine eyes o'er ocean wildly roam  Or deeply fix in mine  That speechless woe can language paint  Or tell the thrilling look  When sighs at length and accents faint  The fearful silence broke  "For theefor theemuch injur'd youth  "'Midst all my sins abhorr'd  "So witness for me heavenly truth  "My bosom's only Lord  "For thee alone these pangs these sights  "My chains no longer wound"  She said when sobs convulsive rise  And choke th' imperfect sound  "Well pleas'd in death these eyes should close  "So thou might'st feel" I cried  "No greater pain than Albert knows  "With Emma by his side  "Secure we brave the changing sky  "By hope forbid to weep  "Love bears his lighted torch on high  "And guides us o'er the deep  "And see the destin'd land appear  That land our faith shall prove  "Alike shall either hemisphere  "Propitious smile on love"  PART THE SECOND  CANTO I  PAST was each gay each joyous hour  No more we festive play'd  In Pleasure's brightlysparkling bow'r  Or Wealth's luxurious shade  But who on Truth's unerring beam  Shall earthyy blessings weigh  Will learn how oft the world's esteem  On wealth is thrown away  The source of human bliss or woe  Where shall enquiry find  Alas the wretched only know  'Tis lodg'd within the mind  'Midst toils severe and labor rude  Far from our native shore  In long and hopeless servitude  The pains of life we bore  Yet Emma here by sorrow taught  Preserv'd love's constant flame  And Emma's love was all I sought  "Twas ease 'twas wealth 'twas fame  Haply one Master's stern command  Our equal lot receiv'd  And fond to aid my stronger hand  Her fainting toil reliev'd  Custom unchang'd contentment gave  We view'd our dangers past  And 'scap'd from Fortune's troubled wave  Here found repose at last  Our chasten'd thoughts the wish inspire  Religion's bonds to prove  And turn the wand'rings of desire  To pure connubial love  What though no whiterob'd priest was near  Our hands no altar join'd  Yet angels stoop'd our vows to hear  And Heav'n the record sign'd  Fain would I pause and o'er the rest  Of my distressful tale  Could mem'ry die within my breast  For ever cast a veil  But conscious duty prompts me here  My sorrows to renew  My trembling lips with words of fear  Their painful task pursue  To him whose pow'r our toils confest  On Gallia's fairer shore  One only son in hour unblest  A longlost consort bore  The father watch'd the pleasing care  Through childhood's tender stage  Of all his treasur'd wealth the heir  And comfort of his age  Now bold in manhood fierce and strong  In wealth and pow'r elate  Proudly he view'd the subject throng  And held tyrannic state  By love subdued his ardent eye  He fix'd on Emma's charms  And doom'd in heedless luxury  The victim to his arms  His subtle arts assail'd her truth  Those arts my Emma spurn'd  Stung by her scorn the haughty youth  In wild resentment burn'd  The guilt his lawless soul desir'd  Insulting force essay'd  I saw with rage indignant fir'd  And rush'd to Emma's aid  Perish presumptuous slave he cried  And aim'd a deadly wound  My bosom own'd its injur'd pride  I fell'd him to the ground  The hunter meets no swifter blow  Who vent'rous points the chace  Where lurks the tiger low'ring low  And guards his infant race  Awhile the spirit's quiv'ring flame  Upon life's confines play'd  The fled and veil'd the wretch's shame  In death's eternal shade  Horrid the deed but greater dread  Our future hours display  Stern vengeance hov'ring o'er my head  Must mark its helpless prey  Alternate ill alone remain'd  To stay'twas death to fly  From every good that life contain'd  'Twas with more pain to die  What voice my ling'ring doubts reprov'd  And bade for flight prepare  "Thy Emma ah too dearly lov'd  "Thy dang'rous flight shall share  "With thee I'll range the desert wide  "While life shall strength supply  "Content to suffer at thy side  "Blest in thy arms to die"  "Cease Emma cease too fondly true  "Thou tempt'st a certain doom  Despair must still our flight pursue  "And Horror's endless gloom  "Where should alas our footsteps stray  "We wander hence in vain  "Famine or ruthless beasts of prey  "Await us on the plain"  The ardor of that dauntless breast  Nor words nor pray'rs allay  With eager look my hand she prest  And daring led the way  CANTO II  O'ER wilds unmark'd by human tread  do nunca pie humano Estampó su pisada  GARCILASO  We took our vent'rous flight  Yet was not Hope's last ember dead  Though pal'd its fainting light  If aught amid those desert plains  By Nature's hand bestow'd  Might temper thirst's unceasing pains  Or yield sustaining food  Perchance the safe and friendly coast  Our toiling steps might gain  Where Britain's sons with envied boast  In British freedom reign  Far swell'd the gale with murm'ring sound  And fill'd our hearts with dread  We cast a fearful look around  And trembling swifter fled  Now o'er the earth the closing night  Her sable veil had thrown  Nor yet had our disastrous flight  Or rest or solace known  Sudden my Emma's bursting tears  In copious torrents fell  "Sweet Love" I cried" these gloomy fears  "Let brighter hope dispel"  "No fears" her falt'ring voice replied  "My constant soul invade  "Where'er we wander by thy side  "I wander undismay'd  "Yet 'midst the shades of night secure  "Escap'd from ev'ry eye  "No more these feeble limbs endure  "Ah cease awhile to fly"  Fainting she spoke with eager haste  My hands her couch prepare  But what amid that dreary waste  Avail'd a lover's care  Yet on the ground my garments laid  Her tender form enclose  "And mine the welcome task" I said  "To watch o'er thy repose  "Parent of mercy from thy hand  "The streams of comfort pour  "Let balmy sleep at thy command  "Her wasted strength restore"  Great God who hear'st the suppliant's cry  And calm'st the wretch's pain  Why in that hour of agony  Were breath'd my pray'rs in vain  CANTO III  SOFT as the sleep which tir'd at eve  The harmless infant knows  So soft ah soft but to deceive  Appear'd my love's repose  With silent joy each breath I heard  That gently heav'd her breast  And many a pray'r anew preferr'd  To bless the wholesome rest  Hope charm'd awhile my troubled thought  When starting from the ground  My neck the trembling Emma caught  And wildly clasp'd me round  "Hold hold they drag him hence away  "But we'll together die  "Ah say my only safety say  "My Albert art thou nigh"  "Behold thy Albert ever near  "Whence spring thy fears anew  "No dang'rous rival threatens here  "No vengeful foes pursue  "To balmy slumber yield again  "Thy limbs that fev'rous burn  "Tomorrow's dawn shall banish pain  "And peace with light return"  Now with tumultuous haste the blood  Cours'd ardent through her veins  And scarce the fiercelyfrantic mood  Her Albert's voice restrains  "Oh scorching fires that inward rage  "And ravage life's retreat  "Oh parching thirst thy force asswage  "Allay thy deadly heat  "Farewell my Albert yet in death  "Let not remembrance die  "Thine is this last this fleeting breath  "And thine this parting sigh"  With accents such as Love inspires  I strove to calm her woe  "If aught to cool those raging fires  "Within the desert flow  "My search the precious draught shall find  "And bring thee quick relief  "Suspend this anguish of the mind  "Endure awhile thy grief"  Then forth my doubtful course I took  Attentive bent to hear  If 'mid the gloom or murm'ring brook  Or bubbling spring were near  While swift I trod the yielding soil  My passing feet bedew'd  O'erjoy'd I bless'd the prosp'rous toil  That ev'ry hope renew'd  Eager I stoop'd with anxious care  Each scanty drop to drain  Then flew the gather'd prize to bear  And sooth my Emma's pain  Perplex'd I trace with fearful choice  The scarceremember'd ground  Aloud I callmy Emma's voice  Returns a grateful sound  As joys the mother o'er her child  If found where chance he strays  While yet her bosom heaving wild  The past alarm betrays  So gladden'd I that sound pursue  Again I call more nigh  Her languid accents scarce renew  The feebly form'd reply  With panting speed more swift I fly  And trembling o'er her bend  "My Emma taste thou shalt not die  "Heav'n deigns this aid to send"  Her lifted arms my bosom press'd  And folding strove to close  But sunk unconscious from my breast  And death's chill damps arose  "Emma" I cried "most lov'd most dear  "Thou all that I adore"  No sound responsive met my ear  The conflict was no more  CANTO IV  SILENT in horror and dismay  Through the drear hours of night  I watch'd afar the doubtful ray  Of slowreturning light  With pangs more keen my soul to fill  Arose that cheerless ray  Appall'd I view'd the mighty ill  And curs'd the coming day  What more ensuedhow robb'd of sense  How prostrate on the plain  Or how awak'dremembrance thence  Attempts to trace in vain  High Heav'n to mercy still inclin'd  Beheld my abject plight  And deign'd upon my darken'd mind  To shed redeeming light  As breathe the plains and smile anew  Amid serener day  Where late the furious whirlwind flew  And scatter'd wild dismay  Such calm my soul perceiv'd when first  Renew'd by Faith's pure beam  While ev'ry passion fled disperst  Before the bright'ning gleam  At once each impious thought repress'd  That madden'd in despair  Devotion taught my alter'd breast  The will supreme to bear  With firm resolve but fainting strength  The lifeless corse I bore  Nor void of hope to reach at length  The distant friendly shore  Not long my toil this close retreat  With grateful wonder view'd  For holy purpose refuge meet  Heav'n's pitying guidance shew'd  'Mid'st parching plains of barren sand  Severely spread around  This vale by Nature's bounteous hand  With springs and woods is crown'd  Beneath yon planetree's branchy shade  The lightest turf I chose  And there her grave with anguish made  My hands were doom'd to close  There while my tears fasttrickling fell  To Heav'n I rais'd my pray'r  And slowly bade a last farewell  To all my earthly care  Now daily o'er that precious mound  HIS goodness I implore  Who knows my suff'ring's latest bound  And will my peace restore  Mine was the guilt by passion led  The virtuous heart to stain  For which Heav'n loads this weary head  With years of ling'ring pain  But may my penitence atone  For innocence betray'd  Just vengeance punish me alone  And spare her injur'd shade  Nine times the sun's revolving ray  Amid these wilds I've view'd  Illume with vainlylavish'd day  The dreary solitude  Meanwhile of man the cheerful face  Or voice 'till you appear'd  My longing eye hath ceas'd to trace  Mine ear hath never heard  And 'till in death these limbs are cold  My sacred vow I'll keep  Full oft o'er yonder swelling mould  To pray to fast and weep  FINIS  The Subject of this Poem is in part taken from a favorite French Novel of which the principal Circumstances are believed to
