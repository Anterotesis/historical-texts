"is noted for producing quantities of pearl There have been regular fisheries for the sake of this pre∣cious article in several of our rivers Sixteen have been found in one shell They are the disease of the fish analogous to the stone in the human body On being squeezed they will eject the pearl and often cast it spontaneously in the sand of the stream  "The Conway was noted for them in the days of Camden A notion also prevails that Sir Richard Wynne of Gwydir chamber∣lain  to Catherine queen to Charles II presented her majesty with a pearl taken in this river which is to this day honoured with a place in the regal crown They are called by the Welsh Cregin Diluw or Deluge Shells as if left there by the flood  "The Irt in Cumberland was also productive of them The famous circumnavigator Sir John Hawkins had a patent for fishing that river He had observed pearls plentiful in the straits of Magel∣lan and flattered himself with being enriched by procuring them within his own island  "In the last century several of great size were gotten in the rivers in the county of Tyrone and Donegal in Ireland One weighed thirtysix  carats  was valued at l but being foul lost much of its worth Other single pearls were sold for l s and even for l The last was sold a second time to lady Glenlealy who put it into a necklace and refused l for it from the duchess of Ormond"  "Suetonius reports that Caesar was induced to undertake his British expedition for the sake of our pearls and that they were so large that it was necessary to use the hand to try the weight of a single one  Sueton Vit Jul Caes  c lxiv  I imagine Caesar only heard this by report and that the crystaline balls in old leases called mineral pearl were mistaken for them  Woodward's Method of Fossils part  "  "We believe

not give it any mark to ascertain the species"  The Mya Margaritifera is found only in great rivers and chiefly in those of the northern parts of Great Britain Da Costa mentions the Tees Alne North and South Tyne Tweed Dee Don c and adds generally inhabits the deeper parts as gulphs whirlpools c  The fishermen in the neighbourhood of the river Conway some∣times collect those shells and extract the pearl but as they are now become scarce and the price inconsiderable the fishery affords them little encouragement  PLATE LXXIV TROCHUS CINERARIUS UMBILICAL TOP SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal a

species found on our coast and figured by Lister p as Linnaeus imagined but a shell altogether distinct the English species Lister notices is the true Venus Islandica of the Linnaean  Systema Naturae

Systema Naturae both the plates and descriptions of Pen∣nant and Da Costa are referred to in the synonyms of Venus Islandica  This shell is perfectly white when fine and is thickly covered with a

the notice of English Conchologists by the Rev Mr Cordiner He discovered them some years ago on the shores of Bamff and sent them with several others disposed in a grotto work as a present to the late Duchess of Portland Since that time they have been found at Lymington in Hampshire by  Mr Keate and lastly during the summer months of was taken in a moat near Portsmouth by J Laskey Esq of Cre∣diton who favoured us with some particulars respecting the ani∣mal inhabiting it In a young state he says it has the appear∣ance of a winged insect and sports in its watery element with all the liveliness of a butterfly and formed a pleasing object when kept alive in a glass of sea water It seems to prefer little pools or still waters within reach of the tide to more exposed situations  In general the specimens that have been found at Portsmouth are very small the shell from which the upper figure is copied far exceeding the others in size This species though very thin and brittle is yet so elastic as to bear much compression with∣out injury and in this respect differs from every other British species of Bulla already known Amongst the foreign kinds are several eclastic kinds and this very species is found of a much larger size in the Mediterranean SeaIndependent of its elasticity the convoluted apex is a material character of this shell considered as a British species  PLATE LXXX TURBO

time in vast abundance in several parts of the country it is not an indigenous kind By whom it was first introduced is uncertain Pennant mentions Sir Kenelm Digby and Da Costa speaks of Charles Howard Esq of the Arundel family Its history as related by Da Costa is so very interesting that we shall give it in the words of its author  "It is the largest species of land snail in England and is found in hedges and woods It closes its shell carefully against winter with a  white thick cover or operculum dull and like plaister and in the closed state it remains till the beginning of April or warm weather at which time it loosens the border of the cover and the animal creeps out of the shell for its necessary occasions Dr Lister in∣forms us he kept one in his bosom about the beginning of March when the animal feeling the warmth in a few hours disengaged its cover and crept out  "The animal being large fleshy and not of an unpleasant taste has been used for food in ancient times it was a favourite dish with the Romans who had their cochlearia or snail stews wherein they bred and fattened them Pliny tells us that the first inventor of this luxury was a Fulvius Harpinus a little before the civil wars between Caesar and Pompey Varro has handed down to us a description of the stews and manner of making them He says open places were chose surrounded by water that the snails might not abandon them and care was taken that the places were not much exposed to the sun or to the dews The artificial stews were generally made under rocks or eminences whose bottoms were watered by lakes or rivers and if a natural dew or moisture was not found they formed an artificial one by bringing a pipe to it bored full of holes like a watering pot by which the place was continually sprinkled or moistened The snails required little attention or food for as they crawled they found it on the floor or area and on the walls or sides if not hindered by the surrounding water They were fed with bran and sodden lees of wines or like substances and a few laurel leaves were thrown on it  "Pliny tells us there were many sorts as the Whitish from Um∣bria the large sort from Dalmatia and the African c This par∣ticular  kind seems to be that he mentions l c They propa∣gate very much and their spawn is very minute  "Varro is scarcely to be credited when he says some would grow so large that their shells held ten quarts  "They were also fed and fattened in large pots or pans stuck full of holes to let in the air and lined with bran and sodden lees or vegetables  "They are yet used as food in several parts of Europe more es∣pecially during Lent and are preserved in stews or  escargotoires  now a large place boarded in and the floor covered with herbs wherein they nestle and feed  "In Italy in many places they are sold in the markets and are called  Bacoli Martinacci  and  Gallinelle  in many provinces of France as Narbonne Franche Comté c and even in Paris They boil them says Lister in river water and seasoning them with salt pepper and oil make a hearty repast  "This is not indigenous or originally a native of these kingdoms but a naturalized species that has throve so well as now to be found in very great quantities It was first imported to us from Italy about the middle of last century by a  scavoir vivre  or epicure as an article of food Mr Aubrey informs us it was a Charles Howard Esq of the Arundel family who on that account scattered and dispersed those snails all over the downs and in the woods c at Albury an ancient seat of that noble family near Ashted Boxhill Dorking and Ebbisham or Epsom in Surrey where they have thriven so much that all that part of the county even to the confines of Sussex  abounds with them insomuch that they are a nuisance and far sur∣pass in number the common or any other species of English snails  The Epicures or  scavoir vivre  of those days followed this luxu∣rious folly and the snails were scattered or dispersed throughout the kingdom but not with equal success neither have records trans∣mitted to posterity the fame of those worthies equal to the Roman Fulvius Harpinus except of two the one Sir Kenelm Digby who dispersed them about Gothurst the seat of that family now of the Wrights near Newport Pagnel in Buckinghamshire where probably they did not thrive much as they were not frequent thereabout the other worthy was a lord Hatton recorded by Mr Morton who scattered them in the coppices at his seat at Kirby in Northampton∣shire where they did not succeed  "Dr Lister found them about Puckeridge and  Ware  in Hert∣fordshire and observes they are abundant in the Southern parts but are not found in the northern parts of this island  "In Surry as before mentioned they abound in several other counties they are not uncommon as in Oxfordshire especially about Woodstock and Bladen in Gloucestershire in Chedworth parish and about Frog Mill in Dorsetshire c but I have never heard that they are yet met with in any of the northern counties"  PLATE LXXXV MYA ARENARIA SAND GAPER  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal an Ascidia Shell bivalve gaping at one end The hinge for the most part furnished with a thick strong

slight depression across the middle posterior part roundish gaping Teeth at the hinge crenulated  MYA DEPRESSA testa subovata antice subcuneiformi declivi medio depressa postice rotundata hiante cardinis dente crenulato  After comparing the numerous kinds of fresh water Myae found in different parts of the kingdom the conchologist will perhaps be sur∣prized at the small number we shall venture to admit as distinct species The varieties of those Shells seem endless and it may be  doubred whether they are not in general indebted to age accident or the peculiar qualities of the waters they inhabit for those variations in general appearance that have been too frequently mistaken for cha∣racteristic differences of species  As the Myae will fall under consideration more fully hereafter we shall for the present confine our remarks to the shell before us and its very analogous kind the Mya ovata of Dr Solander  This has been considered by some as a mere variety of ovata and we confess our opinion is still wavering in assigning it a name and character as a new species The Mya ovata has been lately found in the river Froome in Somersetshire and likewise in the New River near London What are usually deemed its varieties are numerous but none of them can we believe be considered as distinct species except the present which is certainly the most remote of any if it is really a variety of that species The Mya ovata in all its gradations seems somewhat more ventricose and ovate in its contour than this Shell and though the variations of the latter are considerable we have generally observed a slight depression across the middle which causes the narrowest end to be rather flattened throughout and it is also rather more cunciform or wedgeshaped at this end than Mya ovata to this we might perhaps add with some propriety that the gaping beyond the hinge at the broadest end is wider than in Mya ovata  Whether this difference is actually sufficient of form a distinct specific character and whether it is constant in other shells of this kind still remains in some degree of uncertainty Both this and the Mya ovata inhabit the same waters for we have seen several specimens from the  river Froome where it is known the Mya ovata is also found and as to colour it is no criterion both kinds are greenish radiated with yellow and are more or less vivid in different shells they are seldom higher in colour than the specimen we have figured some are more of an olive colour and others are deeply tinged with brown  PLATE CII TURBO FONTINALIS  GENERIC

distinet species it is certainly destitute of those prominent ribs or knobs which is so conspicuous in this Shell in ge∣neral but the transitions from the striated kind to those with knobs is so
