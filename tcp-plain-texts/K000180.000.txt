 THE FASHIONABLE LOVER Price  s    d  THE FASHIONABLE LOVER A COMEDY As it is acted at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN at GARRICK's HEAD in CatharineStreet Strand MDCCLXXII  ADVERTISEMENT  I COMMIT this Comedy to the press with all possible gratitude to the Public for the reception it has met I cannot flatter myself that the same applause will follow it to the closet for as it owed much to an excellent representation I have neither on this nor any preceding occasion considered myself other∣wise than as a sharer only with the Managers and Performers who have distinguished them∣selves in the exhibition of my trifling pro∣ductions But it is not on the score of spectacle only that I am obliged to Mr Garrick I am both in the instance of this Comedy and in that of the West Indian materially indebted to his judgment and owe the good effect of many incidents in both to his suggestion and advice the correction of a real critic is as different from that of a pre∣tender as the operation of a surgeon from the stab of an assassin  The Comedy now submitted to the reader is design'd as an attempt upon his heart and as such proceeds with little deviation from mine if it should be thought therefore that I have meant well the charge of having ex∣ecuted indifferently I shall patiently submit to I have on this occasion as on the two preceding ones wholly rested my perform∣ance upon such poor abilities as I am master of I am not conscious of having drawn any particular assistance either in respect of cha∣racter or design from the productions of others altho' I am far from presuming to say or think that I have ever exhibited any cha∣racter purely original The level manners of a polish'd country like this do not supply much matter for the comic muse which de∣lights in variety and extravagance where∣ever therefore I have made any attempts at novelty I have found myself obliged either to dive into the lower class of men or be∣take myself to the outskirts of the empire the center is too equal and refined for such purposes  Whether the reception of this Comedy may be such as shall encourage me to future efforts is of small consequence to the public  but if it should chance to obtain some little credit with the candid part of mankind and it's author for once escape without those per∣sonal and unworthy aspersions which writers who hide their own names fling on them who publish their's my success it may be hoped will draw forth others to the undertaking with far superior requisites and that there are numbers under this description whose sensibility keeps 'em silent I am well per∣swaded when I consider how general it is for men of the finest parts to be subject to the finest feelings and I would submit whe∣ther this unhandsome practice of abuse is not calculated to create in the minds of men of genius not only a disinclination to en∣gage in dramatic compositions but a languid and unanimated manner of executing them It will drive men from a necessary confidence in their own powers and it will be thought convenient to get out of the torrent's way by mooring under the lee of some great name either French or Italian and sitting down contented with the humble but less expo∣sed task of translation Should this take place a cold elaborate stile will prevail in our drama clearly opposite to the national  character and not at all at unison with the taste of our writers themselves Correctness will become the chief object in view by which though much may be avoided little will be obtained nothing great can be ac∣complished on a plain turn to Shakespear and you find the Alps not more irregular than his genius had the critics of his days marked his inaccuracies with that illiberal spirit which seems reserved for our time the bold and daring sallies of the sublimest Muse would probably have been suppressed and neither the great Actor who has brought his scenes to life nor the elegant Essayist  Essay on the Genius and Writings of Shakespear  who has defended them would have made such display of their own genius in the celebration and protec∣tion of his  RICH  D  CUMBERLAND  PROLOGUE  SPOKEN BY MR WESTON In the Character of a Printer's Devil  I AM a devil so please youand must hoof  Up to the poet yonder with this proof  I'd read it to you but in faith 'tis odds  For one poor Devil to face so many Gods  A ready imp I am who kindly greets  Young authors with their first exploits in sheets  While the Press groans in place of drynurse stands  And takes the bantling from the midwife's hands  If any author of prolific brains  In this good company feels labourpains  If any gentle poet big with rhime  Has run his reck'ning out and gone his time  If any critic pregnant with illnature  Cries out to be deliver'd of his satire  Know such that at our Hospital of Muses  He may lye in in private if he chuses  We've single lodgings there for secret sinners  With good encouragement for young beginners  Here's one now that is free enough in reason  This bard breeds regularly once a season  Three of a sort of homely form and feature  The plain coarse progeny of humble nature  Homebred and born no strangers he displays  Nor tortures freeborn limbs in stiff French stays  Two you have rear'd but between you and me  This youngest is the fav'rite of the three  Nine tedious months he bore this babe about  Let it in charity live nine nights out  Stay but his month up give some little law  'Tis cowardly to attack him in the straw  Dear Gentlemen Correctors be more civil  Kind courteous Sirs take counsel of the Devil  Stop your abuse for while your readers see  Such malice they impute your works to me  Thus while you gather no one sprig of fame  Your poor unhappy friend is put to shame  Faith Sirs you shou'd have some consideration  When ev'n the Devil pleads against Damnation  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs BARRY  LADIES your country's ornament and pride  Ye whom the nuptial deity has tied  In silken setters will ye not impart  For pity's sake some portion of your art  To a mere novice and prescribe some plan  How you would have me live with my good man  Tell me if I should give each passing hour  To love of pleasure or to love of power  If with the fatal thirst of desperate play  I shou'd turn day to night and night to day  Had I the faculty to make a prize  Of each pert animal that meets my eyes  Say are these objects worth my serious aim  Do they give happiness or health or fame  Are hecatombs of lovers hearts of force  To deprecate the demons of divorce  Speak my advisers shall I gain the plan  Of that bold club which gives the law to man  At their own weapons that proud sex defies  And sets up a new female paradise  Lights for the ladies Hark the barbells sound  Show to the clubroomSee the glass goes round  Hail happy meeting of the good and fair  Soft relaxation from domestic care  Where virgin minds are early train'd to loo  And all Newmarket opens to the view  In these gay scenes shall I affect to move  Or pass my hours in dull domestic love  Shall I to rural solitudes descend  With Tyrrel my protector guardian friend  Or to the rich Pantheon's round repair  And blaze the brightest heathengoddess there  Where shall I six Determine ye who know  Shall I renounce my husband or Soho  With eyes halfopen'd and an aking head  And ev'n the artificial roses dead  When to my toilette's morning task resign'd  What visitations then may seize my mind  Save me just Heaven from such a painful life  And make me an unfashionable wife  PERSONS  Lord Abberville  Mr Dodd

wing so soon With so much company can my philosopher want food to feast his spleen upon  Mort  Food I revolt against the name no Bramin cou'd abominate your fleshly meal more than I do why Hirtius and Apicius would have blush'd for it Marc Antony who roasted eight whole boars for supper never massacred more at a meal than you have done  L Abb  A truce good cynick pr'ythee now get thee up stairs and

I did not know your office extended any further  Mort  No when I gave a clear estate into your hands I clear'd myself of an unwelcome office I was indeed your father's executor the gentlemen of fashion and spirit will be your lordship's  L Abb  Pooh you've been blackball'd at some paltry portdrinking club and set up for a man of wit and ridicule  Mort  Not I believe me your companions are too dull to laugh at and too vicious to exposeThere stands a sample of your choice  L Abb  Who Doctor Druid Where's the harm in him  Mort  Where is the meritWhat one quality does that old piece of pedantry possess to fit him for the liberal office of travelling preceptor to a man of rank You know my Lord I recommended you a friend as fit to form your  manners as your morals but he was a restraint and in his stead you took that Welchman that buffoon that antiquarian forsooth who looks as if you had rak'd him out of the cinders of Mount Vesuvius  L Abb  And so I did but pr'ythee Mortimer don't run away I long to have you meet  Mort  You must excuse me  L Abb  Nay I must have you better friendsCome hither Doctor hark'e  Mort  Another time at present I am in no humour to stay

Patience good Doctor patience another time you shall have your revenge at present you must lay down your wrath and take up your attention  Dr Druid  Iv'e done my Lord Iv'e done laugh at my putterflies

with old Bridgemore and her mother 'tis an execrable groupe and as I mean to make all things as easy to me as I can I'm going out to avoid being troubled with their impertinence  Dr Druid  Going out my Lord with your house full of company  L Abb  Oh that's no objection none in the least fa∣shion reconciles all those scruples to consult your own ease in all things is the very first article in the recipe for good breeding when every man looks after himself no one can complain of neglect but as these maxims may not be orthodox on the eastern side of Templebar you must stand Gentleman Usher in this spot put your best face upon the matter and marshal my citizens into the assem∣bly room with as much ceremony as if they came up with an address from the whole company of Cordwainers  Dr Druid  Out on it youv'e some tevilish oomans in the wind for when the tice are rattling above there's nothing but teath or the tevil cou'd keep you below  L Abb  Youv'e guest it such a divine delicious little devil lurks in my heart Glendower himself cou'd not exorcise her I am possest and from the hour I saw her by surprize I have been plotting methods how to meet her a lucky opening offers the mine is laid and Bridge∣more's visit is the signal for springing it  Dr Druid  Pridgemore's how so  L Abb  Why 'tis with him she lives what else cou'd make it difficult and what but difficulty cou'd make me pursue it They prudently enough wou'd have conceal'd her from me for who can think of any other when Miss Aubrey is in sightBut hark they're come I must escapeNow love and fortune stand my friends  Exit  Dr Druid  Pless us what hastes and hurries he is in and all for some young husseyAh he'll never have a proper relish for the venerable antique I never shall bring down his mercury to

beautiful ooman as if she was a statue  BRIDGEMORE Mrs BRIDGEMORE and LUCINDA  Bridge  Doctor I kiss your hands I kiss your hands good DoctorHow these nobles live Zooks what a swinging chamber  Mrs

a very antient family in North Wales  Luc  So it should seem if he's the representative of it  Dr Druid  Without flattery Mrs Bridgemore Miss has very much the behaviours of an ooman of quality

must be done  Mrs Bridge  I thought my Lord had been a man of fashion not of business  Luc  And so he is a man of the first fashion you can∣not have a fresher sample the worst gallant in nature is your maccaroni with the airs of a coquette you meet the manners of a clown fear keeps him in some awe be∣fore the men but not one spark of passion has he at heart to remind him of the ladies  Mrs

track of commerce I disdain to follow I've traced the Oxus and the Ton traversed the Riphaean Moun∣tains and pierced into the inmost Tesarts of Kalmuc Tartaryfollow trade indeed no Iv'e followed the ra∣vages of Kouli Chan with rapturous delight there is the land of wonders finely depopulated gloriously laid waste fields without a hoof to tread 'em fruits without a hand to gather 'em with such a catalogue of pats peetles serpents scorpions caterpillars toadsoh tis a recreating contemplation to a philosophic mind  Bridge  Out on 'em filthy vermin I hope you left 'em where you found 'em  Dr Druid  No to my honour be it spoken I have imported above fifty different sorts of mortal poisons into my native country  Bridge  Lackaday there's people enough at home can poison their native country

town Life is not life without thee never will I quit his feet till I've obtain'd his voice for our alliance  Aug  Alas What hope of that from Mr Mortimer whose rugged nature knows no happiness itself nor feels complacency in that of others  Tyr  When you know Mr Mortimer you'll find how totally the world mistakes him Farewel my dear Au∣gusta back'd with thy virtuous wishes how can I fail to prosper  He goes out and she enters an inner apartment The maidservant immediately introduces LORD ABBERVILLE  Serv  All's safe follow me my Lord she is in her bedchamber  L Abb  Where where  Serv

Aubrey's company I wish no interruption from Miss Bridgemore  Aug  I should be loath to think so an avowal of base∣ness to one woman should never be taken as flattery by another in short my Lord I must intreat you to let the servants show you to some fitter apartment I am here in a very particular situation and have the strongest reasons for what I request  L Abb  I guess your reasons but cannot admit them I love you Madam let that declaration be my excuse  Aug  Nay now your frolick has the air of insult and I insist upon your leaving me  A rapping is heard at the door  Luc  from

assured I'm charmed with your ad∣dress you are a perfect fashionable lover so agree∣able to invite us to your house so well bred to be from home and so considerate to visit poor Miss Aubrey in our absence altogether I am puzzled which to prefer your wit politeness or your honour  Aug  Miss Bridgemore 'tis in vain to urge my inno∣cence to you Heaven and my own heart acquit me I must endure the censure of the world  Luc  O Madam with Lord Abberville's protection you may set that at nought to him I recommend you your company in this house will not be very welcome  Exit  L Abb  to her as she

happiness  Aug  And murderer of my own No no my Lord I'll perish first the last surviving orphan of a noble house I'll not disgrace it from these mean unfeeling people who to the bounty of my ancestors owe all they have I shall expect no mercy but you whom even pride might teach some virtue you to tempt me you with unmanly cunning to seduce distress yourself created sinks you deeper in contempt than Heaven sinks me in poverty and shame  Exit  L Abb  A very unpromising campaign truly one lady lost and the other in no way of being gained Well I'll return to my company there is this merit however in gaming that it makes all losses appear trivial but its own  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  A Library in MORTIMER's House  MORTIMER alone  SO so another day another twelve hours round

Jar  I did Sir but his story's so affecting  Mort  Keep it to thyself old man then why must my heart be wrung I too am one of Nature's spoilt children and havn't yet left off the tricks of the nursery  SERVANT enters  Serv  Sir Mr Tyrrel's come to town and begs to see you  Mort  Let him come in  Tyrrel enters  So nephew what bring's you to town I thought you was a prisoner in the country  Tyr  I was but now Lord Courtland has obtained his liberty no reason holds why I should not recover mine  Mort  Well Sir how have you fill'd up your time In practising fresh thrusts or repenting of that which is past You've drawn your sword to satisfy one man now think of satisfying the rest of mankind  Tyr  You know my story Sir I drew my sword in the defence of innocence to punish and repel the libertine attempts of an ennobled ruffian every man of honour would have done the same  Mort  Yes honour you young men are subtle ar∣guers the cloak of honour covers all your faults as that of passion all your follies  Tyr  Honour is what mankind have made it and as we hold our lives upon these terms with our lives it behoves us to defend them  Mort  You have made it reason then it seems make it religion too and put it out of fashion with the world at once of this be sure I had sooner cast my guineas in the sea than give 'em to a duellist But come Frank you are one from prejudice not principle therefore we'll talk no more on't Where are you lodged  Tyr  At the hotel hard by  Mort  Then move your baggage hither and keep house with me you and I nephew have such opposite pur∣suits that we can never justle besides they tell me you're in love 'twill make a good companion of you you shall rail at one sex while I'm employed with t other and thus we may both gratify our spleen at once  Tyr  O Sir unless you can consent to hear the praises of my lovely girl from hour to hour in endless repetition never suffer me within your doors  Mort  Thy girl Frank is every thing but rich and that's a main blank in the catalogue of a Lady's per∣fections  Tyr  Fill it up then dear Uncle a word of your's will do it  Mort  True boy a word will do it but 'tis a long word 'tis a lasting one it should be therefore a delibe∣rate one but let me see your girl I'm a sour fellow so the world thinks of me but it is against the proud the rich I war poverty may be a misfortune to Miss Aubrey it would be hard to make it an objection  Tyr  How generous is that sentimentLet me have your consent for my endeavours at obtaining her's and I shall be most happy  Mort  About it then my part is soon made ready your's is the task you are to find out happiness in mar∣riage I'm only to provide you with a fortune  Exit Tyr  Well Frank I suspected thou hadst more courage than wit when I heard of thy engaging in a duel now thou art for encount'ring a wife I am convinc'd of it A wife 'sdeath sure some planetary madness reigns amongst our wives the dogsstar never sets and the moon's horns are fallen on our heads  COLIN MACLEOD enters  Colin  The gude time o'day to you gude Maister Mortimer  Mort  Well Colin what's the news at your house  Colin  Nay no great spell of news gude faith aw things with

hoot the whole clan is up in arms I may speak it in your ear an' the de'el himsell was to turn housekeeper he cou'd na' pitch upon a fitter set fellows of all trades countries and occupations a ragamuffin crew the very refuse of the mob that canna' count past twa generations without a gibbet in their scutcheon  Mort  Ay Colin things are miserably chang'd since your old master died  Colin  Ah Maister Mortimer it makes my heart drop blude to think how much gude counsel I ha' cast away up∣on my Laird ifaith I hanna' stinted him o'that I gee'd him rules and maxims of gude husbandry in plenty but aw in vain the dice ha' deafen'd him  Mor  Yes and destroy'd his head heart happiness  are gone to ruin the least a gamester loses is his money  Colin  Ecod and that's no trifle in his case last night's performances made no small hole in that  Mort  Whence learn you that  Colin  From little Napthali of St Mary Axe when a man borrows money of a Jew 'tis a presumption no Chris∣tian can be found to lend him any  Mort  Is your Lord driven to such wretched shifts  Colin  Hoot know you not that every losing gamester has his Jew He is your only doctor in a desperate case when the regulars have brought you to Death's door the quack is invited to usher you in  Mort  Your Jew Colin in the present case savours more of the lawyer than the doctor for I take if he makes you sign and seal as long as you have effects  Colin  You've hit the nail o' the hede my Laird will sign to any thing there's bonds and blanks and bar∣gains and promisary notes and a damn'd sight of rogue∣ries depend on't Ecod he had a bundle for his break∣fast as big as little Napthali cou'd carry I wou'd it had braken his bock and yet he is na' half the knave of yon fat fellow upon Fishstreet Hill  Mort  Bridgemore you mean  Colin  Ay ay he's at the bottom of the plot this little Hebrew's only his jackall  Mort  I comprehend you Bridgemore under cover of this Jew has been playing the usurer with Lord Abber∣ville and means to pay his daughter's portion in parch∣ment this must be prevented  Colin  You may spare your pains for that the match is off  Mort  Heyday friend Colin what has put off that  Colin  Troth Maister Mortimer I canna' satisfy you on that hede but yesternight the job was done methought the business never had a kindly aspect from the first  Mort  Well as my Lord has got rid of Miss I think he may very well spare her fortune  Colin  Odzooks but that's no reason he shou'd lose his own  Mort  That Colin may be past my power to hinder yet even that shall be attempted find out the Jew that Bridgemore has employ'd and bring him hither if you can  Colin  Let me alone for that there never was a Jew since Samson's time that Colin cou'd na' deal with an' he hangs bock and will na' follow kindly troth I'll lug him to you by the ears ay will I and his Maister the fat fellow into the bargain  Mort  No no leave me to deal with Bridgemore I'll scare away that cormorant if the son of my noble friend will be undone it never shall be said he fell without an effort on my part to save him  Exit  Colin  By Heaven you speak that like a noble Gentleman Ah Maister Mortimer in England he that wants mo∣ney wants every thing in Scotland now few have it but every one can do without it  Exit Colin  An Apartment in BRIDGEMORE's House  BRIDGEMORE and DR DRUID  Bridge  But what is all this to me Doctor while I have a good house over my head what care I if the Pyra∣mids of Egypt were sunk into the earth London thank Heaven will serve my turn  Dr Druid  Ay ay look ye I never said it was'nt coot enough for them that live in it  Bridge  Good enough why what is like it where can you live so well  Dr Druid  No where coot truth 'tis all cooks shops and putchers shambles your very streets have savoury names your Poultry your Pyecorner and Puddinglane your Baconalley and Fishstreet Hill here o' my oord the Map of London would furnish out an admi∣rable pill of fare for a LordMayor's dinner  Bridge  Well Doctor I'm contented with Fishstreet Hill you may go seek for lodgings yonder in the ruins Of Palmyra  Dr Druid  Ruins indeed what are all your new buildings up and down yonder but ruins Improve your town a little further and you'll drive every man of sense out of it pless us and save us bye and bye not a monument of antiquity will be left standing from Lon∣donstone to Westminsterhall  Bridge  And if the Commissioners of paving would mend the streets with one and present t'other as a nu∣sance bone setters and lawyers would be the only peo∣ple to complain  Dr Druid  Down with 'em then at once down with every thing noble and venerable and antient amongst you turn the Tower of London into a Pantheon make a new Adelphi of the Savoy and bid adieu to all ages but your own you will then be no more in the way of de∣riving dignity from your progenitors than you are of transmitting it to your posterity  Bridge  Well Doctor well leave me my opinion and keep your own you've a veneration for rust and cobwebs I am for brushing them off wherever I meet them we are for furnishing our shops and warehouses with good profit∣able commodities you are for storing 'em with all the monsters of the creation I much doubt if we cou'd serve you with a dried rattlesnake or a stuft alligator in all the purlieus of Fishstreet Hill  Dr Druid  A stuft alligator a stuft alderman wou'd be sooner had  Bridge  May be so and let me tell you an antiquarian is as much to seek in the city of London as an alderman wou'd be in the ruins of Herculaneum every man after his own way that's my maxim you are for the paltry ore I am for the pure gold I dare be sworn now you are as much at home amongst the snakes and serpents at Don Saltero's as I am with the Jews and jobbers at Jonathan's  Dr Druid  Coot truth Mr Pridgemore 'tis hard to say which collection is the most harmless of the two  MRS BRIDGEMORE enters  I'm out of patience with you Mr Bridgemore to see you stir no brisker in this business with such a storm about your ears you stand as idle as a Dutch sailor in a trade wind  Bridge  Truly love till you come in I heard nothing of the storm  Mrs Bridge  Recollect the misadventure of last night the wickedness of that strumpet you have harboured in your house that viper which wou'd never have had strength to sting hadn't you warm'd it in your bosom  Dr Druid  Faith and truth now I hav'nt heard better reasoning from an ooman this many a day you shall know Mr Pridgemore the viperous species love warmth their sting look ye is then more venomous but draw  their teeth and they are harmless reptiles the conjurors in Persia play a thousand fancies and fagaries with 'em  Bridge  But I'm no Persian Doctor  Mrs Bridge  No nor conjuror neither you wou'd not else have been the dupe thus of a paltry girl  Dr Druid  A girl indeed why all the European world are made the dupes of girls the Asiatics are more wise saving your presence now I've seen a Turkish Pacha or a Tartar Chan rule threescore ay three hundred wives with infinite more ease and quiet than you can manage one  Mrs Bridge  Manage your butterflies your bats and beetles and leave the government of wives to those who have 'em we stand on British ground as well as our hus∣bands Magna Charta is big enough for us both our bill of divorce is a full match for their bill of rights at any time we have our Commons Doctor as well as the men and I believe our privileges are as well manag'd here at St Paul's as their's are yonder at St Stephen's  Dr Druid  Your privileges Mrs Pridgemore are not to be disputed by any in this company and if Miss is as well instructed in her's I wish my Lord Abberville joy of his release that's all  exit  LUCINDA enters  What did the fellow say who sent that old mummy hither  Bridge  He came upon a qualifying message from Lord Abberville as I believe but 'tis such an extravagant old blade he got amongst the pyramids of Egypt before he could well bring it out  Mrs Bridge  I wou'd he was there and his pupil with him don't you see what a condition our poor girl is thrown into  Luc  I into a condition No they shall never have to say they threw me into a condition I may be angry but I scorn to own I'm disappointed  Bridge  That's right child sure there are more men in the world besides Lord Abberville  Luc  Law papa your ideas are so gross as if I car'd for any of the sex if he hadn't singled her out from all women kind but it was ever thus she's born to be my  evil genius sure the men are madTyrrel Lord Abber∣villeone touch'd my heart the other wounds my pride  Bridge  Why ay there is a fine estate a noble title great connections powerful interest  Luc  Revenge is worth them all drive her but out of doors and marry me to a convent  Bridge  But let us keep some shew of justice this may be all a frolic of Lord Abberville's the girl perhaps is innocent  Luc  How can that be when I am miserable  Mrs Bridge  Come she's been suffer'd in your house too long had I been mistress she shou'd have quitted it last night upon the instant wou'd she had never entred it  Bridge  There you make a bad wish Mrs Bridgemore she has proved the best feather in my wing but call her down go daughter call her down  Luc  I'll send her to you nothing shall prevail with me to speak to her or look upon the odious creature more  Exit  Mrs Bridge  What is it you are always hinting at about this girl she's the best feather in your wing Explain yourself  Bridge  I can't you must excuse me 'tis better you shou'd never know it  Mrs Bridge  Why where's the fear what can you have to dread from a destitute girl without father and without friend  Bridge  But is she really without father was I once well assured of thatBut hush my daughter's hereWell where's Miss Aubrey  LUCINDA enters followed by a MAID SERVANT  Luc  The bird is flown  Bridge  Heyday gone off  Mrs Bridge  That's flat conviction  Bridge  What have you there a letter  Luc  She found it on her table  Bridge  Read it Lucy  Luc  I beg to be excused Sir I don't chuse to touch her nasty scrawl  Bridge  Well then let's see I'll read it myself  Reads  Sir Since neither Lord Abberville's testimony nor my most solemn protestations can prevail with you to believe me innocent I prevent Miss Bridgemore's threaten'd dismission by withdrawing myself for ever from your family how the world will receive a destitute defenceless orphan I am now to prove I enter on my trial without any armour but my innocence which though insufficient to secure to me the continuance of your confidence will by the favour of Providence serve I hope to support me under the loss of it  Augusta Aubrey  So she's elop'd  Mrs Bridge  Ay this is lucky there's an end of her this makes it her own act and deed give me the letter go you need not wait  to the servant  Serv  Madam  Luc  Don't you hear leave the room  Serv  Pray don't be angry I beg to speak a word to you  Luc  Go go another time I'm busy  Serv  I've done a wicked thing and if I don't discharge my heart 'twill break it is so full  Mrs Bridge  What have you done speak out  Serv  Why I have been the means of ruining an innocent person for such Miss Aubrey is  Bridge  How so go on  Serv  'Twas I that brought Lord Abberville last night into her chamber unknown to her I thought it was a little frolic to surprise her but when I heard her scream I was alarmed and ran and listened at the door  Luc  Well and what then  Serv  Why then I heard her chide him and desire him to be gone yes and but just before you came up stairs I heard the poor young Lady reproach him bitterly for his baseness in making love to her when he was engaged to you Madam indeed she is as innocent as the babe unborn  Luc  Go your way for a simpleton and say no more about the matter  Serv  To be sure I was a simpleton to do as I did but I shou'd never survive it if any mischief was to follow  Ex  Bridge  What's to be done now  Mrs Bridge  What's to be done why let her take her course guilty or not what matters it if every man who offers for your daughter is to turn aside and follow after her  Luc  True where's the woman who can pardon that indeed had she been really criminal I cou'd have endur'd her better for then I had had one qualification which she had wanted now she piques me every way  A SERVANT enters and speaks  Lord Abberville Madam desires to be admitted to say a word to you  Luc  Who Lord Abberville  Mrs Bridge  Oh by all means admit him now Lucy show yourself a woman of spirit receive him meet his in∣sulting visit with becoming contempt Come Mr Bridge∣more let us leave them to themselves  Exeunt Mr and Mrs BRIDGEMORE  Luc  Ahem now pride support me  LORD ABBERVILLE enters to her  L Abb  Miss Bridgemore your most obedient I come Madam on a penitential errand to apologize to you and Miss Aubrey for the ridiculous situtation in which I was surprised last night  Luc  Cool easy villain  aside  L Abb  I dare say you laugh'd most heartily after I was gone  Luc  Most incontinentlyincomparable assurance  aside  L Abb  Well I forgive you 'twas ridiculous enough a foolish frolick but absolutely harmless be assur'd I'm glad to find you no longer serious about itBut where's Miss Aubrey pray  Luc  You'll find her probably at your own door she's gone from hence  SERVANT enters and speaks  Mr Tyrrel Madam  Luc  Show him in prayMy Lord you've no objec∣tion  L Abb  None in life I know him intimately but if you please I'll take my leave you may have businessCurse on't he is the Lady's lover  aside  Luc  Nay I insist upon your stayingNow malice stand my friendGood morning to you Sir you're wel∣come to town  TYRREL enters  Tyr  I thank youI am wrong I believe your servant should not have shewn me in here 'tis with Miss Aubrey I request to speak  Luc  Lord Abberville you can direct Mr Tyrrel to Miss Aubrey she has left this family Sir  Tyr  MadamMy LordI beg to knowI don't understand  L Abb  Nor I upon my soul was ever any thing so malicious  aside  Luc  My Lord why don't you speak Mr Tyrrel may have particular business with Miss Aubrey  L Abb  Why do you refer to me How shou'd I know any thing of Miss Aubrey  Luc  Nay I ask pardon perhaps Mr Tyrrel's was a mere visit of compliment  Tyr  Excuse me Madam I confess it was an errand of the most serious sort  Luc  Then it's cruel not to tell him where you've plac'd her  Tyr  Plac'd her  L Abb  Ay plac'd her indeed For Heaven's sake what are you about  Luc  Nay I have done my Lord but after last night's fatal discovery I conceived you wou'd no longer affect any privacy as to your situation with Miss Aubrey  Tyr  What did you discover last night Madam tell me I have an interest in the question  Luc  I'm sorry for't for then you'll not be pleas'd to hear that she admits Lord Abberville by night into her bed∣room locks him up in it and on detection the next morn∣ing openly avows her guilt by eloping to her galant  Tyr  What do I hear My Lord my Lord if this is true  L Abb  What then what if it is must I account to you who makes you my inquisitor  Tyr  Justice humanity and that controul which virtue gives me over it's opposers if more you wou'd with an∣guish I confess my heart unhappily was plac'd on her whom you have ruin'd now you'll not dispute my right  L Abb  This is no place to urge your right I shall be found at home  Tyr  I'll wait upon you there  Exit Tyrrel  L Abb  Do soyour servantMiss Bridgemore I am infinitely your debtor for this agreeable visit I leave you to the enjoyment of your many amiable virtues and the pleasing contemplation of what may probably ensue from the interview you have provided for me with Mr Tyrrel  Exit  Luc  Ha ha ha I must be less or more than woman if I did not relish this retaliation

Aubrey she's the happy woman  Aug  Is she the happy woman Well Sir if you'll deliver that letter into Mr Tyrrel's hands there is no  treason in it against Miss Aubrey she herself is privy to the contents  Colin  You need na' doubt but I shall honde it to him I were a sorry child an I cou'd grudge you that where shall I bring his answer  Aug  It requires none  Colin  But an he craves to know your house where mun I say you dwell  Aug  I have no house no home no father friend or refuge in this world nor do I at this moment fainting as I am with affliction and fatigue know where to find a

invention a rare device to hook in customers when I was plain Nan Rawlins of St Martin's parish scarce a yard of ferret cou'd I fell to club a prentice's hair on a Sunday morning now there's not a Knight of the Thistle that does not wear my green paduasoy across his shoulder nor a Mac passes my shop who does not buy snuff and black ribband of his kins∣woman of such consequence is it to have a good name in this world  Exit  A room in LORD ABBERVILLE's house  LORD ABBERVILLE enters followed by several servants  L Abb  You are a most unreasonable set of gentry truly I have but one Scotchman in my family and you are every one of you cook valet butler up in arms to drive him out of it  La Jeu  And with reason my Lord Monsieur Colin is a grand financier but he has a little of what we call la maladie du päys he is too oeconomique it is not for the credit of mi Lord Anglois to be too oeconomique  L Abb  I think La Jeunesse I have been at some pains to put that out of dispute but get you gone all together and send the fellow to me I begin to be as tir'd of him as you are  Exeunt servants  His honesty is my re∣proach these rascals flatter while they rob me it angers me that one who has no stake no interest in my fortune should husband it more frugally than I who am the owner and the sufferer in short he is the glass in which I see myself and the reflection tortures me my vices have de∣form'd me gaming has made a monster of me  LA JEUNESSE reenters  L Abb  Well is the savage coming  La Jeu  He is only turning his cravat my Lord and will be here immediately  L Abb  Leave me  Exit LE JEUNE COLIN enters  Come hither Colin what is this I hear of you  Colin  Saving your presence I shou'd guess a pratty many  lies 'twill mostly be the case when companions in office give characters

bluntness 'tis no recommendation to me Macleod nor shall I part from all my family to accommodate your spleen from the stableboy to my own valet there's not a domestic in this house gives you a good word  Colin  Nor ever will till I prefer their interest to your's hungry curs will bark but an' your Lordship wou'd have us regale our friends below stairs while you are feasting your's above gadzooks I have a pratty many countrymen in town with batter appetites than purses will applaud the regulation  L Abb  'Tis for such purses and such appetites you would be a fit provider 'tis for the latitude of the High∣lands not for the meridian of London your narrow scale of oeconomy is laid down  Colin  Oeconomy is no disgrace 'tis batter living on a little than outliving a grate deal  L Abb  Well Sir you may be honest but you are troublesome my family are one and all in arms against you and you must know Colin Macleod I've great ob∣jection to a rebellion either in a family or state whatever you and your countrymen may think of the matter  Colin  My Lord my Lord whan you have shad the blude of the offenders it is na' generous to revive the offence as for mine awn particular Heaven be my judge the realm of England does na' haud a heart more loyal than the one I strike my honde upon  DOCTOR DRUID enters to them  L Abb  So Doctor what's the news with youWell Colin let me hear no more of these complaints don't be so considerate of meand hark'e if you was not quite so parsimonious to yourself your appearance would be all the better  Colin  Troth I'd be better habited but I canna' afford it  L Abb  Afford it sirrah don't I know you have money enough if you had but spirit to make use of it  Colin  True but I fain wou'd keep a little together d'ye see lest you shou'd not  Exit  Dr Druid  Plessing upon us how the man prates and prattles 'Twas but this morning he was differing and disputing truly about pedigrees and antiquities tho' I can count forty and four generations from the grandmother of Saint Winifred as regularly as a Monk can tell his beads  L Abb  Leave your generations to the worms Doctor and tell me if you carried my message to BridgemoreBut why do I ask that when I myself am come from put∣ting the finishing hand to that treaty and really if young women will keep companions who are handsomer than themselves they mustn't wonder if their lovers go astray  Dr Druid  Ah my Lord Apperville my Lord Apper∣ville you've something there to answer for  L Abb  Preach not good sixtyfive thy cold conti∣nence to twentythree the stars are in my debt one lucky throw at least let them bestow Miss Aubrey and I'll cancel all that's past  A Servant delivers a letter  what have we herefrom Tyrrel I supposeno 'tis from a more peaceable quarter my commodious Mrs Macin∣tosh  Reads  "Chance has thrown in my way a girl that quite eclipses your Miss Somers come to me with∣out loss of time lest the bird should be on the wing"  What shall I do I have but little stomach to the business Aubrey is my goddess and 'tis downright heresy to fol∣low any other  Another Servant enters  Serv  My Lord a person without says he comes with a recommendation from Sir Harry Gamble  L Abb  What sort of a person  Serv  A little ugly fellow I believe he's a Jew  L Abb  That's right I had forgot my Jew is fairly jaded Sir Harry's probably is better trained so let me see him who is in the antichamber  Serv  There are several persons waiting to speak with your Lordship they have called a great many times  L Abb  Ay ay they come for money he alone comes with it therefore conduct that little ugly fellow as you call him to my closet and bid those other people call again  Exit Servant  Doctor if any of my particulars  are importunate to see me don't let 'em interrupt me here tell 'em I'm gone to Mrs Mackintosh's they'll know the place and my business in it  Exit  Dr Druid  They may guess that without the gift of divination truly Ah this passion is the prejudice of education he may thank France and Italy for this I would have carried him through Ingria Esthonia and Livonia through Moldavia Bessarabia Bulgaria Thrace from the Gulph of Finland to the Streights of the Dardanelles 'Tis a chance if he had seen a human creature in the whole course of his travels  TYRREL enters to him  Tyr  Doctor forgive me this intrusion where is Lord Abberville his servants deny him to me and I've business with him of a pressing sort  Dr Druid  Business indeed  Tyr  Yes business Sir I beg you to inform me where to find him  Dr Druid  I take it Mr Tyrrel you are one of his particulars therefore I tell you he is gone to Mrs Mac∣intosh's a commodious sort of a pody who follows one trade in her shop and another in her parlour  Tyr  Yes yes I know her well and know his busi∣ness there  Dr Druid  Pleasure is all his business I take for granted he finds some gratification in his visits there  Tyr  Yes the gratification of a devil the pleasure of defacing beauty and despoiling innocence of planting everlasting misery in the human heart for one licentious transitory joy 'tis there he holds his riots thither he is gone to repeat his triumphs over my unhappy Aubrey and confirm her in her shame  Dr Druid  Ay I suppose Miss Aubrey is the reigning passion now  Tyr  Curs'd be his passions wither'd be his powers Oh Sir she was an angel once such was the graceful modesty of her deportment it seemed as if the chastity which now so many of her sex throw from them cen∣tered all with her  Dr Druid  I've told too much this lad's as mad as hewell Mr Tyrrel I can say but little in the case  women and politics I never deal in in other words I abhor cuckoldom and have no passion for the pillory  Exit  COLIN enters  Colin  Gang your gait for an old smoakdried piece of goat'sflesh  shuts the door  Now we're alone young Gen∣tleman there's something for your private reading  Deli∣vers a letter  Tyr  What do I see Miss Aubrey's hand Why does she write to me Distraction how this racks my heart  Colin  Ay and mine tooecod it gave it sike a pull I canna for the sol of me get it bock into it's place again gude truth you'll find it but a melancholy tale  Tyr  reads  "I am the martyr of an accident which never will find credit under this stroke I can't conceal a wish that Mr Tyrrel would not give me up but as his single opposition to the world's reproach might be as dangerous to him as it must be Ineffectual to me I earnestly advise him to forget the unfortunate Au∣gusta"  What am I to conclude The paper looks like innocence the words as soft as modesty cou'd utterThe martyr of an accident She calls it accident why that's no crime Alas it might be accident which threw temptation in her way but voluntary guilt which yielded to the tempter of him she makes no mention Pray Sir inform me you have seen this Lady  Colin  I have  Tyr  Discours'd with her  Colin  I have  Tyr  In that discourse do you recollect if she named Lord Abberville  Colin  I recollect

sufferer in this business and ear∣nestly intreat you to desist from any altercation with Lord Abberville on my account  Tyr  I'm satisfied and shall religiously obey you Lord Abberville I ask your pardon for this interruption I never shall repeat it more  Aug  But are you going  Tyr  For ever Dangerous to behold you are there∣fore before my fond my foolish heart relapses into love I'll seize

my LordStand off  MORTIMER enters  Mort  Ay what is it you mean my Lord  L Abb  Mortimer 'sdeath what evil genius con∣ducted you hither  Mort  goes to the door  Nay my good friend come in  COLIN enters  This honest man was my conductor while you Lord Abberville in a distinguish'd rank are openly assaulting innocence he in his humble post is secretly supporting itIf you come under that de∣scription Madam I am your defender if not I have no further business here  Aug  Why shou'd I urge my innocence I am unfor∣tunate I'm poor your nephew Sir will tell you that is cause sufficient for abandoning me  L Abb  This grows too serious I scorn to steal that from you half my fortune could not purchase I believe you are as innocent as Heaven first form'd you and to con∣vince the world in what esteem I hold your virtues here before Mortimer I offer you my hand and lay my title rank and fortune at your feet  Aug  No there may be a legal prostitute as well as a licentious one had you a world to give after your base experiment you cannot offer any thing that I shall take You may find others less exceptious but in a noble fa∣mily though stripp'd of fortune there will still be pride  L Abb  I see my fate I see a prepossession in your heart too strong for me to shake I plainly perceive that Mr Tyrrel can offend with more impunity than I can however Mortimer you are a man of honour I resign Miss Aubrey into your hands for the present and shall expect you will avail yourself of no unfair advantages over meMacleod I find Miss Aubrey is to thank you for this seasonable visit of Mr Mortimer's  Exit  Mort  Come Madam you are now my ward Bridge∣more must struggle hard to get you back again  Aug  SirMr Mortimer You'll pardon me but must I think you serious If what you now propose is meant in kindness to me I must say the world has not done justice to your character I have been taught to look upon you as no friend to our sex in particular  Mort  Nor am I your sex have broke treaty with us pass'd the bounds betwixt us forc'd into our very taverns and from being once the glory of my country are become it's shame  Aug  But all have not done this  Mort  Nor am I then at enmity with all a virtuous individual is of no sex no country  Colin  No country Hoot A true North Briton will give up his virtue afore his country at any time  Aug  Yes and I think it was a partiality to your country rather than to virtue which determin'd you to put me into this house  Colin  De'il take me now and all may kindred with me if I knew ought about the house more than the name of Macintosh upon the door  Mort  Time will clear all things up a general mis∣conception is gone forth my nephew I perceive has fallen under it As for poor Colin his design in bringing you hither was more than innocent depend upon it it was noble I have heard his story and at my request he brings me here commit yourself therefore to my protection and rely upon my justice  Aug  How shall I answer you Your generosity o'er∣whelms me  Mort  I generous No I am a meer voluptuary I study luxury by principle and am as sensual on the side of virtue as Abberville or any other fashionable rake on that of viceColin you'll settle matters with your countrywoman and come to us at my house  Exeunt  Colin  My countrywoman The fiend a bit I never will believe she has a drop of Scottish blude in aw her composition as I shall answer I never blush'd before for any of the name there must be something spurious in her genealogy I'll have a little serious talk with her on that I've got the pedigree of the Macintoshes at my fingers ends and if there's e'er a flaw in her descent 'twixt this and Noah gadzooks I'll wager a hundred pounds I prove her an impostor  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  Fishstreet

that goes by will be as often right as you and judge as wisely never talk to me of judging others till you've condemn'd yourself  Tyr  I do condemn myself and if Miss Aubrey does not sign my pardon I am disposed not only to condemn but execute  Mort  Away then and throw yourself upon the mercy of the court it is the fate of bunglers to be asking pardon  Exit Tyrrel  COLIN enters  Colin  Bless you

stranger  Mort  A stranger Sir is welcome I cannot always say as much to an acquaintance  Aub  I plainly see your experience of mankind by the value you put upon them  Mort  True Sir I've visited the world from arctic to ecliptic as a surgeon does a hospital and find all men sick of some distemper the impertinent part of mankind are so busy the busy so impertinent and both so incurably ad∣dicted to lying cheating and betraying that their case is desperate no corrosive can eat deep enough to bottom the corruption  Aub  Well Sir with such good store of mental pro∣vision about you you may stand out a siege against society your books are companions you never can be tir'd of  Mort  Why truly their company is more tolerable than that of their authors wou'd be I can bear them on my shelves tho' I shou'd be sorry to see the impertinent puppies who wrote them however Sir I can quarrel with my books too when they offend my virtue or my reasonBut I'm taking up your time the honest Scotch∣man who announc'd you told me you had something of importance to communicate to me  Aub  I have I'm told I am your debtor and I came with a design to pay you down such thanks as your bene∣volence well merits but I perceive already you are one whom great professions wou'd annoy whose principle is virtue and whose retribution rises from within  Mort  Pray Sir no more of this if you have any thing to request propose it I'd rather much be told what I may do for you than reminded of what I may have done  Aub  I readily believe you and according to your hu∣mour will address you I own you may confer a benefit upon me 'tis in your power Mr Mortimer to make me happiest of all mankind  Mort  Give me your hand why now you speak good sense I like this well let us do good Sir and not talk about it show me but how I may give happiness to you with innocence to myself and I shall be the person under obligation  Aub  This then it is you have a young person under your protection a Lady of the name of Aubrey  Mort  I have  Aub  Resign her to my care  Mort  Sir  Aub  Put her into my hands I am rich Sir I can support her  Mort  You're insolent or grossly ignorant to think I wou'd betray a trust a sacred trust she is a ward of vir∣tue 'tis from want 'tis from oppression I protect Miss Aubreywho are you that think to make a traitor of me  Aub  Your zeal does honour to you yet if you persist in it and spite of my protest hold out your constancy will be no virtue it must take another name  Mort  What other name and why Throw off your mystery and tell me why  Aub  Because  Mort  Ay let us hear your cause  Aub  Because I am her father  Mort  Do I live  Aub  Yes in my heart while I have life or memory that dear injur'd girl whom you so honourably protect is my daughter The overflowings of a father's heart bless and reward you You whom I know not and that poor Highlander out of his small pittance have under Provi∣dence prerserv'd my child whilst Bridgemore whom I rais'd from penury and trusted with the earnings of my travel has abandoned and defrauded her  Mort  O mother Nature thou'lt compel me to for∣swear thee  Aub  Ah Sir you feel the villainy of man in every vein I am more practised and behold it only with a sigh Colin and I have laid a little plot to draw this Bridgemore hither he believes me dead and thinks he is to meet a person at your house who can relate particulars of my death in which case it is clear he means to sink a capital consign∣ment I sent him about three years since and turn my daughter on the world  Mort  Well let him come next to the satisfaction I receive in the prosperity of an honest man I am best pleased with the confusion of a rascal  TYRREL enters hastily  Tyr  Dear uncle on my kneeswhat am I doing  Mort  You thought I was alone  Tyr  I did  Mort  And what had you to tell me in such haste  Tyr  I had a petition to prefer on which my happiness in life depends  Aub  I beg I may retire I interrupt you  Mort  By no means I desire you will not stir let him make his request if it is not fit for you to hear it is not fit for me to grant Speak out nay never hesitate  Tyr  What can I ask of you but to confirm my hopes and make Miss Aubrey mine  Mort  Was ever the like heard Pray whence do you  derive pretensions to Miss Aubrey Tell me in presence of this Gentleman  Tyr  Not from my own deservings I confess yet if an ardent firm disinterested passion sanctified withal by her consent can recommend me I am not without some title  Mort  Look you there now this fellow you shall know Sir is my nephew my sister's son a child of fortuneHark'e with what face do you talk of love who are not worth a groat  Tyr  You have allow'd me Sir to talk of love openly beneath your eye I have solicited Miss Aubrey's consent and gain'd it as for my poverty in that I glory for therein I resemble her whom I adore and I shou'd hope tho' for∣tune has not favour'd us we have not lost our title to the rights of nature  Mort  Pooh the rights of nature While you enjoy it's rights how will you both provide against its wants  Tyr  Your bounty hitherto has let me feel no wants and shou'd it be your pleasure to withdraw it thanks to Pro∣vidence the world is not so scantily provided but it can give to honest industry a daily dinner  Mort  Fine words But I'll appeal to this good Gen∣tleman let him decide betwixt us  Aub  In truth young gentleman your uncle has good reason on his side and was I he I never wou'd consent to your alliance  ith Miss Aubrey till she brought a fortune large enough to keep you both  Tyr  These are your maxims I've no doubt they only prove to me that you love money more than beauty gene∣rosity or honour  Aub  But is your Lady in possession of all these Let me be made acquainted with her and perhaps I may come over to your sentiments  Mort  Ay Frank go fetch your girl and let my friend here see her I'm in earnest Upon my honour nephew till you've gain'd this Gentleman's consent you never can have mine so go your ways and let us see if you have interest enough to bring her hither  Tyr  Oh if my fate depends upon her looks they must be iron hearts that can withstand 'em  Exit  Aub  The manly and disinterested passion of this youth while it possesses me strongly in his favour gives an assurance  of a virtuous conduct in my child indeed Sir I am greatly taken with your nephew  Mort  Thank Heaven the boy as yet has never made me blush and if he holds his course he may take one half of my fortune now and t'other at my deathBut see Sir here your daughter comes  TYRREL introduces MISS AUBREY  Tyr  You are obeyed you see the Lady and you've nothing now to wonder at but my presumption  Aub  To wonder at I do behold a wonder 'Tis her mother's image Gracious Providence this is too much  Mort  You will alarm her your disorder is too visible  Aub  I cannot speak to her I pray you let me hear her voice  Aug  Why am I sent for is your uncle angry how have I offended  Aub  Hush hush she speaks 'tis she herself it is my longlost wife restor'd and rais'd again  Mort  Pooh what had I to do to meddle with these mat∣ters  Aug  Why does that Gentleman regard me so atten∣tively His eyes oppress me ask him if he knows me  Tyr  Sir if you know this Lady if you've any tidings to communicate that touch her happiness oh that I cou'd inspire you with my feelings  Aub  I knew your father and am a witness to the hard necessity which tore him from an infant child and held him eighteen tedious years in exile from his native land  Aug  What do I hear You was my father's friendThe prayer and intercession of an orphan draw Heaven's righteous benediction down upon you  Aub  Prepare yourself be constant I have news to tell you of your father  Mort  I can't stand this I wish I was any where else  Tyr  Courage my dear Augusta my life upon it there is happiness in store for thee  Aug  Go on go on  Aub  You are in an error you are not an orphan you have a father whom thro' toil and peril thro' sickness and thro' sorrow Heaven has graciously preserv'd and blest at length his unremitting labours with abundance  Tyr  Did I not tell you this Bear up  Aub  Yes virtuous Augusta all your sufferings termi∣nate this moment you may now give way to love and hap∣piness you have a father living who approves your passion who will crown it with a liberal fortune who now looks upon you speaks to you embraces you  Embraces her  Mort  There there I'm glad 'tis over Joy befall you both  Tyr  See how her colour fliesShe'll faint  Aub  What have I done Dear innocent look up  Aug  Oh yes to Heaven with gratitude for these divine vouchsafementsI have a father then at lastPardon my tears I'm little us'd to happiness and have not learn'd to bear it  Tyr  May all your days to come be nothing else But look she changes againHelp me to lead her into the air  Tyrrel and Aubrey lead her out  Mort  I believe a little air will not be much amiss for any of us Look at that girl 'tis thus mortality encounters happiness 'tis thus the inhabitant of earth meets that of heaven with tears with faintings with surprize let others call this the weakness of our nature to me it proves the unworthiness for had we merits to entitle us to hap∣piness the means wou'd not be wanting to enjoy it  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  The Hall in LORD ABBERVILLE's House  LORD ABBERVILLE followed by

a heavy collection of ores from the mines of Siberia and a pretty large cargo of common salt from the banks of the Caspian  Dr Druid  Inestimable  Mort  Oh Sir mere ballast  Dr Druid  Ballast indeed and what discoveries does he draw from all these  Mort  Why he has discover'd that the bricks are not  fit for building the mines not worth the working and the salt not good for preserving in short Doctor he has no taste for these trifles he has made the human heart his study he loves his own species and does not care if the whole race of butterflies was extinct  Dr Druid  Yes putterflies'tis in my mind d'ye see what you have said about my putterflies 'tis upon my memory but no matteryour studies Mr Mortimer and mine are wide asunderBut go onreform the world you'll find it a tough task I am

is a man one seldom meets I little thought of ever setting foot in his house I hope the savage won't grow ceremonious and return the visit  Luc  Unless he brings his nephew in his hand  MORTIMER enters  Mort  Ladies you do me honour Mr Bridgemore you come here upon a mechancholy errand  Bridge  True Sir but death you know is common to all men I look'd to meet a gentleman herethis is all lost time  Mort  True therefore before he comes let us fill it up with something more material I have a business to propose to you which I consider as my own You must know Sir I've a nephew  Bridge  Mr Tyrrel I suppose  Mort  The same  Mrs Bridge  Mind that Lucy he is opening his com∣mission  Luc  Law Ma'am you put me into such a flutter  Mort  There is a certain Lady Mr Bridgemore whom on this occasion you must father  Bridge  How tedious he is Coudn't he as well have nam'd my daughterWell Sir what are your expecta∣tions from that Lady  Mort  Nay nothing but what you can readily supply I know no good thing she stands in want of but a for∣tune  Bridge  Well and who doubts but on a proper occa∣sion I shall give her one Ay and a tolerable fortune too Mr Mortimer as times go  Mort  The fortune you was to have given my ward Lord Abberville will just suffice I think the sum was forty thousand pounds  Bridge  Why you speak out at once  Mort  'That ever been my custom I abominate long sleepy processes life don't allow of 'em  Bridge  But I hear nothing on your part Mr Tyrrel as I take it is wholly dependant on your bountybesides affairs as I conceive are yet scarce ripe  Luc  Indeed pappa you're very much mistaken  Mrs Bridge  Why really Mr Mortimer the parties shou'd at least be suffer'd to consult each other's inclina∣tions  Mort  By all means let 'em speak for themselves 'tis their own cause and they will plead it best hark'e come in Sir these are the parties  TYRRELL and MISS AUBREY enter  Luc  Ah  Mort  What ails you have you trod upon a thorn  Mrs Bridge  Astonishing assurance Augusta here  Mort  Yes Francis Tyrrel and Augusta Aubrey Do the names offend you Look at the parties are they not well match'd Examine them they'll tell you they're agreed Who shall forbid their union  Luc  Who cares about it If Mr Tyrrel and the Lady  are agreed that's enough I suppose it is not necessary for us to be present at the ceremony  Bridge  Ay Sir I pray you where's the occasion for us to be call'd in because your nephew chuses to take up with an unworthy girl that I once harbour'd upon charity  Tyr  Hold your audacious tongue let conscience keep you silent  Aug  Hush hush you frighten me pray be compos'd and let me own that no injustice no severity can wholly cancel what I owe to Mr Bridgemore for his past pro∣tection and that share of education he allow'd me but when he puts this to the account of charity he takes a virtue foreign to his heart and only aggravates the shame that's falling on him  Mrs Bridge  Is the man thunderstruck why don't you answer  Mort  Charity keeps him silent  Luc  Come let's begone her words have daggers in 'em and her looks are poison  Aug  Before you go Miss Bridgemore suffer me to ask when you related Lord Abberville's adventure to Mr Tyr∣rel why you suppress'd the evidence of your own maid who conducted him into my chamber  Luc  Miss Aubrey if it ever is your fate to have a rival you will find an answer to that question  Exit with Mrs Bridgemore  Mort  Hold you and I Sir must not part  To Bridge∣more as he is going  Bridge  Well Sir your pleasure  Aug  I suffer for him this is a scene I wish not to be present at  Exit  Tyr  Well Mr Bridgemore you that harbour'd my Augusta upon charity I shall leave my uncle to discharge my obligations to you on that score together with his own  Exit  Mort  Well Sir we're now alone and if it needs must be that one of us shall come to shame 'tis well we are so It is thought I am a hard unfeeling man let it be so you shall have justice notwithstanding innocence requires no more You are accus'd defend yourself  Bridge  Accus'd of what and who is my accuser  Mort  A man and you shall face him like a man Who waits  A Servant enters  Desire the stranger to  come hither  exit Servant  Fear nothing we're enough to try this question where the human heart is present and the appeal is made to Heaven no jury need be sum∣moned Here is a stranger has the confidence to say that your pretensions to charity are false nay he arraigns your honesty a charge injurious to any man but mortal to a trader and levell'd at the vital root of his profession  Bridge  Ay 'tis the Turky merchant I suppose let him come in I know upon what ground I stand and am afraid of no man living  Mort  aside  We shall try that Do you know this Gentleman  AUBREY enters  Bridge  starting  Aubrey  Aub  Thou wretch  Bridge  He lives  Aub  To thy confusionRais'd by the bounty of my family is this your gratitude When in the bitterness of my distress I put an infant daughter in your hands the last weak scyon of a noble stock was it to rob me you received her To plunder and defraud an helpless orphan as you thought her and rise upon the ruins of your benefactor's fortune  Bridge  Oh I am trepann'd How shall I look my wife and daughter in the face  aside  Aub  Where have you lodg'd the money I deposited with you at parting I find my daughter destitute what have you done with the remittances I sent from time to time But above all where is the produce of the Nep∣tune's cargo Villain look here I have the proofs this is the abstract of the sale if you dispute it I am here provided with a witness your Jew broker ready at hand to attest it to your face  Bridge  Expose me not I will refund to the last far∣thing I dispute nothing call him not in  Mort  There's no occasion for witnesses when a man pleads guilty  MISS AUBREY enters and throws herself on her knees to her Father  Aug  Dear Sir upon my knees I do beseech you miti∣gate your severity it is my first petition he's detected let his conscience add the rest  Aub  Rise my beloved child it shall be so There Sir your pardon be your punishment it was my money only you attempted my choicest treasure you have left untouch'd now go and profit by this meeting I will not expose you learn of your fraternity a more honour∣able practice and let integrity for ever remain the inse∣parable characteristic of an English merchant  Mort  Stay I've another point to settle with you you're a creditor of Lord Abberville's I find you've put Miss Aubrey's money to extraordinary interest Jarvis shew this Gentleman into my library you'll find a lawyer there will settle your accounts  Bridge  I think you've pretty well done that alreadyA fine visit truly I have made on't and a fine reception I shall meet at home  Exit  Aub  So This uneasy business past let us now turn to happiness where is your Nephew  Mort  Conferring with Lord Abberville  Aug  Lord Abberville You frighten me  Mort  Fear nothing you will find him a new man a deep incision has let out the disorder and I hope a healthy regimen in time will heal the wound in short I can't be idle and now Frank is off my hands I've once more un∣dertaken to set this ricketty babe of quality upon his legsOh here he comes why this is as it should be now you look like friends  Lord ABBERVILLE and Mr TYRREL  L Abb  May we be ever so O Mortimer I blush to look upon that Lady your reproofs I bore with some com∣posure but methinks was she to chide me I should sink with shame  Aug  You've nothing my Lord Abberville to appre∣hend from me I should be loth to give an interruption to your happiness in the height of my own  Aub  Give me thy hand AugustaIn the hope that I was labouring for thy sake and in thy person that I shou'd restore the prostrate fortunes of an ancient house I have toiled on through eighteen years of wearisome ad∣venture crown'd with success I now at length return and find my daughter all my fondest hope could represent but past experience makes me provident I would secure my treasure I would bestow it now in faithful handsWhat say you Sir will you accept the charge  To Tyrrel  Tyr  Yes and will bear it ever in my sight watch over it with unremitting love and guard it with my life  Aub  What says my child my dear Augusta But I read her looksBlest be you both  Mort  Amen say I Live an example to the age and when I read the list of marriages as I do that of burials with a sigh let me have this to say that there was one example of felicity  L Abb  O Frank 'tis hard to speak the word but you deserve her yours is the road to happiness I have been lost in error but I shall trace your steps and press to overtake you  Mort  Why that's well said there spoke your father from within you now begone fly to the altars of your country lares visit that nurse of contemplation solitude and while you range your groves that shook at every rattle of the dice ask of your reason why you was a gamester  L Abb  I've been a madman I have lost an humble faithful friend whose services wou'd be invaluable  Mort  Why ay your Highlander your poor Macleod our plan must stop without his help I'm but a projector he must executebut there likewise I can serve you  L Abb  O Mortimer how much have I mistaken thee  Mort  Come come I have my faults I'm an un∣toward fellow and stand as much in need of a reform as any of you all  DOCTOR DRUID enters hastily followed by COLIN  Dr Druid  Tutor me trulytalk to me Pray Gen∣tlemens bear witness is Master Colins here a proper teacher of the dialects d'ye see and pronunciations of the English tongue  Colin  Why not Is there not Duncan Ross of Aberdeen that lactures twice a week in oratory at the Seven Dials and does not Sawney Ferguson a cousin of mine awn administer the English language in it's utmost elegance at Amsterdam  Dr Druid  Bear witness that is all I say bear wit∣ness  Mort  We do there is not one amongst us Doctor but can witness to some noble act of Colin's and we wou'd not wound his harmless vanity for any bribe that you can offer  L Abb  Colin I've done you wrong but I was not myself be you no worse a servant than you have been and you shall find henceforward I will be a better master  Colin  I'm satisfied an you'll neglect yoursall na more than I shall do things will gang well enow  Tyr  I must apologize to Colin too like my Lord Ab∣berville I was not myself when I rebuff'd you on the business of Miss Aubrey's letter  Colin  Say no more Maister Tyrrel 'tis not for a mon to resent the pertness of a child or the petulance of a lover  Aug  But what shall I say to him where shall I find words to thank him as I ought  Aub  I father all your obligations 'twas not you but me his bounty sav'd  L Abb  Hold Sir in point of obligation I stand first By how much there is more disgrace in doing than in suffering a violence by so much I am more his debtor than you all  Colin  Ecod and that is true enow Heaven sends mis∣fortune but the De'il sends mischief  Dr Druid  Well Master Colins all is past and over you have got your place again and all is well Coot now let me admonish you for the future to be quiet and hear reason moderate your choler and your passions and your partialities it is not for a clown like you to prattle and dispute with me in fait you shou'd know better  Mort  Come come 'tis you that shou'd know better in this poor Higlander the force of prejudice has some plea because he is a clown but you a citizen that shou'd be of the world whose heart philosophy and travel might  have open'd shou'd know better than to join the cry with those whose charity like the limitation of a brief stops short at Berwick and never circulates beyond the Tweed By Heaven I'd rather weed out one such unmanly pre∣judice from the hearts of my countrymen than add another Indies to their empire  END OF THE PLAY
