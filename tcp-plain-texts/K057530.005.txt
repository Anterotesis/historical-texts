 THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  VOL V  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  'TIS SO PAT TO ALL THE TRIBE  EACH CRIES THAT WAS LEVELLED AT ME  GAY  VOLUME V  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G G AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW AND SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  CHAP I  A CURSORY GLANCE AT LAW FICTIONS LEGAL SUPPOSITIONS ENDLESS THE PROFESSIONAL JARGON OF AN ATTORNEY AN ENQUIRY INTO THE INTEGRITY OF BARRISTERS AND THE EQUITY OF DECISIONS AT LAW A AND B OR A CASE STATED A DIGRESSION FROM LAW TO PHILOSOPHY  IN the mean time my application to the law was incessant and consequently my intercourse with lawyers daily increased I endeavoured to load my brain with technical terms and phrases to understand technical distinctions and to acquaint myself with the history of law fictions and the reasons on which they had been founded  To these subjects my attention had been turned by Mr Hilary who being a Solicitor was well acquainted with the value of them to the man who meant to make himself a thorough lawyer  The consideration of this branch of law staggered my judgment Trottman and Hilary were intimate The latter had invited us and other friends to dinner and as I found the acuteness of Trottman useful to me in my pursuits I took this and every occasion to put questions which he was very ready to answer As it happened my enquiry on the subject of law fictions brought on the following dialogue which was supported by Trottman entirely in his own style  "According to your account then" said I in answer to a previous remark "in  Banco Regis  the King is always  supposed  to be present"  "No doubt what question can there be  of that One invisible kind of being can as easily be supposed as another And I hope you will not dispute the actual presence of that pleasant gentleman called the devil in any one of our courts"  "By no means"  "As for his majesty he God bless him by the nature of his office is  hic et ubique  here there and every where He is borne in state before each Corporation Mayor whether Mr or My Lord and reposes peacefully in front of Mr Speaker or the Lord High Chancellor investing them by his sacred presence with all their power"  "How so"  "How so Do you forget the mace upon the table"  "Authority then has that virtue that like grace divine into a wafer it can be transfused into wood"  "Yes A lord's white wand a general's  baton a constable's staff It is thought necessary I grant in some of these cases that the block should be carved and gilded"  "Well the position is that in  Banco Regis  the King is always present"  "So says the law"  "But the law it appears tells a lie and from all that I have heard I wish it were the only one that it told"  "Could the law hear sir it would take very grave offence at your language It only assumes a fiction"  "John Doe and Richard Roe who are the pledges of prosecution are two more of its  supposes  or lies I beg pardon I should have said fictions"  "Why yes considering that John Doe and Richard Roe never made their personal appearance in any court in the kingdom were never once met in house street or field in public or in private  nay had never yet the good luck to be born they have really done a deal of business"  "They resemble Legion entering the swine they plunge whole herds into the depths of destruction"  "Or if you will they are a kind of real yet invisible hobgoblins by whom every human being is liable to be haunted It must however be allowed of them that they are a pair of very active and convenient persons"  "To lawyers But God help the rest of mankind Are there many of these fictions"  "More than I or any man I believe can at one time remember"  "From the little I have read this appears to be a very puzzling part of the profession"  "Not at all if we will take things as we find them and neither be more curious nor squeamish than wise I  will state the process of a suit to you and you will then perceive how plain and straightforward it is We will suppose A the plaintiff B the defendant A brings his action by bill Action you know means this  Actio nihil aliud est quam jus prosequendi in judicium quod sibi debetur"  or "a right of prosecuting to judgment for what is due to one's self" B is and was  supposed  to be in the custody of the Marshal Observe  supposed to be  for very likely B is walking unmolested in his garden or what not B we will say happens to live in Surry Kent or any other county except Middlesex and is  supposed  to have made his escape though perhaps he may have broken his leg and never have been out of his own door And then the latitat  supposes  that a bill had issued and further  supposes  that it has been returned  non est inventus  and moreover  supposes  it to have been filed B lives in Kent you know and this  latitat is addressed in  supposition  to the Sheriff of the county greeting though as to the Sheriff he neither sees hears nor knows any thing concerning it and informs him that B notwithstanding he is confined to his bed by a broken leg runs up and down in  supposition  and secretes himself in the Sheriff's county of Kent on which "  "I beg your pardon I cannot follow you through all this labyrinth of  supposes"  "No Then you will never do for a lawyer for I have but just begun I should carry you along an endless chain of them every link of which is connected"  "And which chain is frequently strong enough to bind and imprison both plaintiff and defendant"  "Certainly or the law would be as dead in its spirit as it is in its letter"  "I fear I shall never get all the phrases and forms of law by rote"  "Why no If you did heaven help you it would breed a fine confusion in your brain You would become as litigious and as unintelligible as our friend Stradling  "Mr Stradling" said Hilary "is one of my clients an unfortunate man who being a lawprinter has in the way of trade read so many lawbooks and accustomed himself to such a peculiar jargon as to imagine that he is a better lawyer than any of us so that he has halfruined himself by litigation He is to dine with us and will soon be here"  "I will provoke him" continued Trottman "to afford you a sample of his gibberish you may then examine what degree of instruction you suppose may be obtained from a heterogeneous topsyturvy mass of law phrases"  "But why irritate your friend"  "You mistake He has it so eternally on his tongue that instead of giving him pain to shew the various methods in which he supposes he could torment an antagonist at law it affords him the highest gratification"  "Our friend Hilary here is better qualified for the task of instruction but he feels some of your qualms and is now and then inclined to doubt that there is vice in the glorious system which regulates all our actions"  "I deny that it regulates them" said Hilary "If people in general had no more knowledge of right and wrong than they have of law their actions would indeed be wretchedly regulated"  This was a sagacious remark It made an impression upon me that was not forgotten It suggested the important truth that the pretensions of law to govern are ridiculous and that men act as Hilary  justly affirmed well or ill according to their sense of right and wrong  Mr Stradling soon after came and Trottman very artfully led him into a dispute on a supposed case which Trottman pretended to defend and aggravated him by contradiction till Stradling roundly affirmed his opponent knew nothing of conducting a suit at law  The volubility of this gentleman was extraordinary and the trouble I thought myself obliged to bestow at that time on the subject could alone have enabled me to remember any part off the jargon he uttered in opposition to Trottman which in substance was as follows  "Give me leave to tell you friend Trottman you know nothing of the matter and I should be very glad I could provoke you to meet me in Westminsterhall If I had you but in the Courts damn me if you should easily get out"  "I tell you once more I would not leave you a coat to your back"  "You Lord help you I would  traverse  your indictment  demur  to your plea bring my  writ of error nonsuit  you Sir I would  ca sa fi fa  you I would  bar  you I would  latitat  you  replevin  you  refalo  you I would have my  non est inventus  my  alias  and  pluries  and  pluries  and  pluries ad infinitum  I would have you in  trover  in  detinue  I would send your loving friend Richard Roe to you I would  eject  you I would make you  confess lease entry and ouster  I would file my  bill of Middlesex  or my  latitat  with an  ac etiam  Nay I would be a worse plague to you still I would have my bill filed in B R I would furnish you with a special original for C P You talk I would sue out my  capias alias  and  pluries  at once and outlaw you before you should hear one word of the proceeding"  Bless me thought I what innumerable ways there are of reducing a man to beggary and destruction according to law  Trottman thus provokingly continued  "My dear Mr Stradling your brain is bewildered You go backward and forward from one supposition to another and from process to process till you really don't know what you say If I were your opponent in any Court in the kingdom I should certainly make the law provide you a lodging for the rest of your life"  "Bring your action That's all Bring your action and observe how finely I will  nonpros  you or reduce you to a  nolle prosequi  You think yourself knowing Pshaw I have nonsuited fifty more cunning fellows in my time and shall do fifty more"  God help them thought I  "I have laid many a pert put by the heels You pretend to carry an action through the Courts with me Why sir  I have helped to ruin three men of a thousand a year and am in a fair way at this very hour of doing as much for a Baronet of five times the property"  I listened in astonishment  "And do you take a pleasure in remembering this" said Hilary  "Pleasure" answered Stradling staring "Why do you think Mr Hilary I should have taken a pleasure in ruining myself What did I do but act according to the laws of my country And if men will oppose me and pretend to understand those laws better than I do let them pay for their ignorance and their presumption Let them respect the law or let their brats go beg"  "The law I find sir" said I "has no compassion"  "Compassion indeed No sir Compassion is a fool and the law is wise"  "In itself I hope it is but I own I doubt the wisdom of its practice"  "But this practice you must know" said Trottman with a wink to Stradling "Mr Trevor means to reform"  "Oh" replied Stradling "then I suppose when the gentleman is at the bar he will never accept a brief till he has first examined the equity of the case"  "That sir" I replied "is my firm intention"  "Ha ha ha Mr Trevor you are a young man You will know better in time"  "And do you imagine sir that I will ever hire myself to chicanery and be the willing promoter of fraud If I do may I live hated and die despised"  "Ay ay Very true I don't remember that I ever met with a youth who had just begun to keep his terms who did not profess much the same And which is well worthy of remark those that have been most vehement in these professions have been most famous when  they came to the bar for undertaking and gaining the rottenest causes"  "You shall find however sir that I shall be an exception to this rule"  "Excuse me Mr Trevor for not too hastily crediting hasty assertions I know mankind as well as I know the law However I can only tell you that if your practice keep pace with your professions you will never be Lord Chief Justice"  "Do the judges then encourage barristers who undertake the defence of bad and base actions"  "To be sure they do They sometimes shake their heads and look grave but we know very well they defended such themselves or as I tell you they would never have been judges If two men have a dispute one of them must be in the wrong And who is able to pronounce which except the law"  "My dear Mr Stradling" said Trottman "you are again out of your depth  When two men dispute it almost always happens that they are both in the wrong And this is the glorious resource of law and the refuge of its counsellors and its judges"  Trottman and Stradling were accustomed to each other's manner and notwithstanding the language they used nothing more was meant than a kind of jocular sparring which would now and then forget itself for a moment and become waspish but would recollect and recover its temper the next sentence  I replied to Trottman "It is true that when two men dispute it generally happens they are both in the wrong But one is always more in the wrong than the other and it should be the business of lawyers to examine and of the law to decide upon their different degrees of error"  "What sir" exclaimed Stradling "If you were counsel in a cause for plaintiff  A instead of exposing the blunders and wrongs of defendant B would you enquire into those of your own client"  "I would enquire impartially into both"  "And if you knew any circumstance which would infallibly insure plaintiff a nonsuit you would declare it to the Court"  "I would declare the truth and the whole truth"  "Here's doctrine Here's law"  "No" said Trottman "it is not law It is reform"  "It ought to be law As an advocate I am a man who hire out my knowledge and talents for the avowed purpose of doing justice and am to consider neither plaintiff nor defendant but justice only Otherwise I should certainly be the vilest of rascals"  "Heyday" thundered Stradling and after a pause added"It is my  opinion those words are liable to a prosecution Mr Trevor and by G if you were to be cast in any one of our Courts for them it would be no fault either of the bench or the bar if the sentence of the law which you are defaming did not shut you up for life"  "My friend Trevor mistakes the nature of the profession he is studying" added Trottman "He forgets that the question before a Court is not what is this that or the other which he may think proper to call justice but what is the law"  "To be sure sir" continued Stradling "It is that which as a lawyer you must attend to and that only"  "I will cite you an example" said Trottman  "A was a gentleman of great landed property B was an impertinent beggarly kind of sturdy fellow his neighbour A had an estate in the county of  that lay in a ringfence a meadow of nine acres excepted which belonged to B This meadow it was convenient for A to purchase and he sent his steward who was an attorney to make proposals B rejected them The steward advised A to buy the estate that belonged to C but that was farmed by B The advice was followed The lease of B expired the following year and a new one was denied by A unless B would sell his meadow B consented A bought the meadow but determined to have his revenge For this purpose A refused payment and provoked B to commence an action The law he knew very well was on the side of B but that was of little consequence Plaintiff B brought his action in Trinity Term Defendant A pleaded a sham plea asserted plaintiff had been paid for his meadow by a firkin of butter All a lie you  know long vacation was thus got over and next term defendant files a bill in Chancery to stay proceedings at law Plaintiff B files his answer and gets the injunction dissolved but A had his writ ready and became plaintiff in error carried it through all the Courts from K B to the Exchequerchamber and from the Exchequerchamber as A very well knew that B had no more money A brought error into Parliament by which B was obliged to drop proceedings His attorney of course would not stir a step further and the fool was ruined He was afterward arrested by his attorney for payment of bill in arrear and he now lies in prison on the debtors'side of Newgate"  "How you stare Mr Trevor" added Stradling "Every word true We all know a great lord who has carried I cannot tell how many such causes"  "And were the judges" said I "acquainted with the whole of these proceedings"  "How could they be ignorant of them Judgment had passed against defendant A in all the Courts"  "And did they afford the plaintiff no protection"  "They protect Why Mr Trevor you imagine yourself in Turkey telling your tale to a Cady who decides according to his notions of right and wrong and not pleading in the presence of a bench of English judges who have twice ten thousand volumes to consult as their guides which leave them no opinion of their own It is their duty to pronounce sentence as the statutebooks direct or as in the case I have cited according to precedent time immemorial"  "And this is what you call law"  "Ay and sound law too"  "Why then damn the "  "You do right to stop short sir"  "It appears to me that I am travelling in a cursed dirty as well as thorny road" said I with a sigh  "Why to own the truth" added Trottman "you must meet with a little splashing and unless you can turn back and look at it with unconcern I should scarcely advise you to proceed"  "I shall certainly reconsider the subject"  "A pair of lawyers like a pair of legs are apt to bespatter each other but they nevertheless remain good friends and brothers If you send your spaniel into a muddy pool you ought to take care when he comes out that he does not shake the filth he has collected over his master"  "I wonder sir that you should continue one of a profession which you treat with such unsparing severity"  "And I sir do not wonder at your  wonderings Life is a long road and he must have travelled a very little way indeed who expects that it should be all a bowlinggreen Pursue your route in which direction you will law trade physic or divinity and prove to me that you will never have occasion to shake off the dust from your feet in testimony against it and I will then pause and consider You are of the sect of the Perfectibles"  "And you of the cast of the Standstills"  "Oh no I conceive myself to be among children at a fair riding in a roundabout Like the globe they inhabit men are continually in motion but they can never pass their circle"  "And do you suppose you know the limits of your circle"  "Within a trifle The experience of state empires and ages has decided that question with tolerable accuracy"  "But what if a power should have arisen of which you have not had the  experience of states empires and ages except of a very small number And what if this partial experience as far as it goes should entirely overthrow your hypothesis"  "I know that in argument your  if  is a very renowned potentate If the moon should happen to be a cheese it may some time or another chance to fall about our ears in a shower of maggots But what is this mighty power that has done so much in so short a time and from which you expect so many more miracles"  "It is the art of printing When knowledge was locked up in Egyptian temples or secreted by Indian Bramins for their own selfish traffic it was indeed difficult to increase this imaginary circle of yours but no sooner was it diffused among mankind by the discovery of the alphabet than in a short period it was succeeded by the wonders of Greece and  Rome And now that its circulation is facilitated in so incalculable a degree who shall be daring enough to assert his puny standard is the measure of all possible futurity I am amazed sir that a man of your acuteness your readiness of wit and your strength of imagination can persist in such an affirmative"  "The  argumentum ad hominem  Very sweet and delectable Thank you sir"  "Every thing is subject to change why not therefore to improvement That change is inevitable there are proofs look where you will that which is called innovation must consequently be indispensible Examine the history of your own science When England was infested with wolves we are told that King Edgar imposed an annual tribute of thirty wolves' heads on the Welsh Princes that the breed might be extirpated Had this tribute been levied after the race was partly destroyed the law would have  counteracted its own intention for in order to pay the tax the tributary Princes must have encouraged the breed and once more have stocked the country with wolves"  Stradling was little better than infected with what have been lately stigmatised by the appellation of Jacobinical principles and exclaimed with great exultation"Your remark is very true sir and it is an example that will serve admirably well to illustrate another point Placemen and pensioners a race more ravenous and infinitely more destructive than wolves have been propagated for the support of the Executive Government and the breed increases so rapidly that it will very soon devour its feeders"  "And next itself"  "With all my heart Let me but see that vermin extirpated and I shall die in peace"  "Very right Mr Stradling" said Trottman with great gravity "Placemen and pensioners are vile vermin And so will remain till your party comes into office"  "If ever I could be brought to accept of place or pension may I "  "I believe you for I am well persuaded your virtue will never be put to the trial Otherwise I should imagine it would find as many good arguments I mean precedents in favour of the regular practice in politics as in law"  Here our dialogue paused Dinner was announced and law politics and patriotism were for a while forgotten by all except myself in the enjoyments of venison and old port  CHAP II  MORE PAINFUL DOUBTS AND FURTHER ENQUIRIES UNEXPECTED ENCOURAGEMENT AND WARM AFFECTIONS FROM A CHARACTER BEFORE SUPPOSED TO BE TOO COLD HOPE STRENGTHENED AND CONFIRMED  DESULTORY as the conversation I have recited had been it left a very deep impression upon my mind It was roundly asserted by every lawyer to whom I put the question that the whole and sole business of a counsellor was the defence of his client Right or wrong it was his duty to gain his cause and with respect to the justice of it into that generally speaking it was impossible that he should enquire Briefs were frequently put into his hand as he entered the Court which he was to follow as instructed  It did now and then happen that a cause was so infamous as to put even the  hacknied brow of a barrister to the blush but it must be a vile one indeed And even then when he threw up his brief though paid before he began to plead it was matter of admiration to meet so disinterested an example of virtue in an advocate  It was in the practice of the law that I hoped to have taken refuge against the arguments of Turl which averse as I had been to listen proved even to me that in principle it was not to be defended  The train of thinking that followed these deductions was so very painful that I was obliged to fly from them and seek advice and confirmation in the friendship of Wilmot before I should write on the subject to Mr Evelyn For the latter task indeed my mind was not yet sufficiently calm collected and determined  My chie  consolation was that the subject had thus been strongly brought to  the test of enquiry before the expiration of the month which according to agreement I was to be with Counsellor Ventilate previous to the payment of my admissionfee of which as it was a heavy one thus to have robbed the charities of Mr Evelyn would have given me excessive anguish  I know not whether I was sorry or glad when I came to Wilmot's lodging to find Turl there He had returned from his bathing excursion having been called back sooner than he expected by his affairs  He was cheerful and in excellent spirits His complexion was clear his health improved and his joy at our meeting was evident and unaffected He even owned that hearing I had devoted myself to the law he had returned thus soon the more willingly once again to argue the question with me for that he felt himself very highly interested in the future  employment of talents of which he had conceived extraordinary hopes and that he thought it impossible they should be devoted to such a confusing study were there no other objection to it as that of the law without being not only perverted and abused but in a great degree stifled  After an avowal like this it required an effort in me to summon up my resolution and honestly state the doubts and difficulties that had arisen in my own mind It was happy for me that my friends were men whose habitual sincerity prompted me to a similar conduct I therefore took courage opened my heart and while describing my own sensations was impelled to confess that the practice of the law could with great difficulty indeed be reconciled to the principles of undeviating honesty  "I most sincerely rejoice" said Turl "that these doubts have been suggested  to you by other people rather than by me for I am very desirous you should not continue to think me too prone to censure And in addition to them I would have you take a retrospect of your plan To induce you to despond is a thing which I would most sedulously avoid but to suffer you to delude yourself with the hopes of sudden wealth and when I say sudden I would give you a term of ten years from the practice of the law unless you should plunge into that practice with the most unqualified disregard to all that rectitude demands would be to act the cowardly disingenuous hypocrite and entirely to forget the first and best duties of friendship  "Should you ask'What path then am I to pursue' I own I am totally at a loss for an answer The choice must be left to yourself You are not ignorant that it is infinitely more easy to point out mistakes which have been and still continue  to be committed daily than to teach how they may be entirely avoided Of this I am well assured if you will confide in and exert those powers of mind that you possess they must lead you to a degree of happiness of the enjoyment of which I am sorry to say but few are capable  "From my own experience and from that of all the young men I meet who are thrown upon the world I find that the period which is most critical and full of danger is the one during which they are obliged unsupported to seek a grateful and worthy way of employing their talents  "My own resource has been that of cheerfully submitting to what are called the hardships of obscure poverty and of consoling myself not only with a firm persuasion that by this course in time I shall infallibly change the scene but that till this time shall come I am employing  myself on the subjects which can best afford me present satisfaction That is in endeavours however narrow and feeble to enlarge the boundaries of human happiness and by means like these to find a sufficiency for my own support  "I know not that I ought to advise you to pursue a similar plan though I can truly say I am unacquainted with any other which is equally promising  "How to answer or appease the imperious demands of your present ruling passion I cannot devise Neither can I say that I am convinced it is blameable except in its excess That you should desire to obtain so so rare and inestimable a treasure as that of a woman who not to insist upon her peculiar beauty is possessed of the high faculties with which she whom you love is affirmed to be endowed is an ambition which my heart knows not how to condemn as unworthy There is something in it so congenial to all my own feelings  that to see you united to her would give me inexpressible pleasure  "You will perhaps be surprised to hear me own that notwithstanding the obstacles are so numerous that I have no perception of the manner in which they are to be overcome I yet rejoice with you that you have discovered such a woman that she has assuredly a rooted affection for you and that you have thus obtained one advantage over all your friends a strong and unconquerable motive to outstrip them in your efforts  "Shall I add that desperate as your case seems to be I participate in your sanguine hopes I do not deem them entirely romantic but share in that which the phlegmatic would call the frenzy of your mind and halfpersuade myself that you will finally be victorious  "Then summon up your fortitude Do not suffer the failure of illconcerted plans either to lessen your ardour or give  it a rash and dangerous direction Be cool in decision warm in pursuit and unwearied in perseverance Time is a never failing friend to those who have the discernment to profit by the opportunities he offers Let your eye be on the alert and your hand active and firm as circumstances shall occur and I shall then say I scarcely know what it is that you may not hope to achieve"  Wilmot stood with his head resting on his arm leaning against the mantlepiece When Turl began his eye was cast down a compassionate melancholy overspread his countenance and a deep sigh broke from him unperceived by himself As our mutual friend proceeded his attitude altered his head was raised his eye brightened his features glowed his soul was wrapt in the visions which were raised by Turl and unconscious of his own existence or that he spoke his interrupting ejaculations now and then involuntarily  burst forth"That is true"Well arguedDo you think soIndeed I am glad of thatDon't despond TrevorDon't despond'Tis folly to despond"  Just as he repeated the last sentence "'Tis folly to despond" so full a rememberance of his former trains of thought came over him and there was so divine a mixture of hope and melancholy in his face which seemed so to reproach himself and to encourage me that divided as my feelings were between the generous emanations of Turl and these torrents of affection from a man who had suffered so deeply I seized the hand of each pressed them both to my heart instantly dropped them again covered my face fell against the wall and sobbed with something like hysteric passion  Of all the pleasures of which the soul is capable those of friendship for man and love for woman are the most exquisite  They may be described as"the comprehensive principle of benevolence which binds the whole human race to aid and love each other individualized and put into its utmost state of activity" Selfishness may deride them and there may be some so haunted by suspicion or so hardened in vice as to doubt or deny their existence But he that has felt them in their fullest force has the best as well as the grandest standard of human nature and the purest foretaste of the joys that are in store for the generations that are to come  This is the spirit that is to harmonize the world and give reality to those ideal gardens of paradise and ages of gold the possibility of which as the records of fable shew could scarcely escape even savage ignorance  What clue shall I give the reader to my heart that shall lead him into its recesses and enable him to conceive its  entire sensations That Turl from whom I imagined I had met so much discouragement whose scrutinizing eye led him to examine with such severity and whose firm understanding possessed such powers of right decision that he should not only sympathize with me but partake in my best hopes and countenance me in my soul's dearest pursuit that Turl should feel and act thus was a joy inconceivably great and unexpected  He now no longer appeared to me as one to whom though I could not but revere him I durst not confess myself but as a generous anxious and tender friend My former flashes of hope had usually been succeeded by a gloomy despair that made me half suspect myself to be frantic but after this concession and encouragement from Turl they seemed instantly to spring into consistency probability and system  Turl highly approved my forbearance  and caution respecting the letter I had written and was so anxious to convey to Olivia  This farther coincidence of opinion not only induced me to persevere in my plan but afforded me a degree of grateful satisfaction and selfrespect that was exceedingly consolatory  CHAP III  MORE TRAITS OF THE CHARACTER OF MR EVELYN A NEW PROJECT OF A VERY FLATTERING NATURE BOROUGH INTEREST AND A PATRIOTIC BARONET  IT may well be supposed that Turl was induced to enquire and I to explain the means by which I should have been enabled to pursue the study of the law for he had heard of my misfortunes and the dissipation of my finances  This brought the behaviour and character  of Mr Evelyn in review and the admiration of Turl with the terms of affection and respect in which he spoke of that gentleman was additional delight He had never entertained any serious doubt he said but that such men existed perhaps many of them yet to discover a single one was an unexpected and to say the truth a very uncommon pleasure  But Mr Evelyn was to be made acquainted with my change of sentiment and of my being once more destitute of any plan for my future guidance It was necessary that he should not deem me a man of unsettled principles frivolous in propensity and fantastic in conduct For though perhaps my pride would have felt gratification at no longer considering myself a dependent on the favourable opinion or calculations which another might form concerning me and  my good or ill qualities yet I could not endure to sink in his esteem  I therefore applied myself immediately in the most assiduous manner to collect and state such facts as I had gathered relative to the practice of the law and that the argument might be placed in the clearest light possible I begged of Turl to take that part of the subject which related to its principles upon himself  Thus provided I wrote to Mr Evelyn and my letter was fortunate enough to produce its desired effect  Nor was he satisfied with mere approbation His anxious and generous friendship would not suffer him to rest and he immediately made a journey to town to consult with me since this project was rejected what should be my new pursuit  His behaviour verified all the assertions of his former discourse concerning the  hopes that he had conceived of my talents He considered nothing within the scope of his fortune as too great a sacrifice if it could but promote the end he desired For this purpose he not only consulted with Wilmot and Turl but led me into such conversations as might best display the bent of my genius and afford him hints on which to act  And now he was induced to form a design such as I little expected and which required of me the acceptance of obligations so great as well might stagger me and render it difficult for me to consent  He had remarked that my enunciation was clear and articulate my language flowing my voice powerful and my manner prepossessing Such were the terms which he used in describing these qualities in me The youthful manliness of my figure he said added to the properties I have mentioned was admirably  adapted for parliamentary oratory My elocution and deportment were commanding and principles such as mine might awe corruption itself into respect and aid to rouse a nation and enlighten a world Mr Evelyn like myself was very much of an enthusiast  He did not immediately communicate the project to me which was indeed first suggested to him by accidental circumstances but previously examined whether it was as he supposed it to be possible to be carried into effect  Sir Barnard Bray had the nomination of two borough members one of which he personated himself and disposed of the other seat as is the custom to a candidate who should be of his party and consequently vote according to his opinion  He had long been the loud and fast friend of Opposition No man was more determined in detecting error more hot  in his zeal or more vociferous in accusation than Sir Barnard his dear and intimate friend the right honourable Mr Abstract excepted who was indeed pepper or rather gunpowder itself  Mr Evelyn was the cousin of this patriotic baronet  It happened just then to be the eve of a general election and as the last member of Sir Barnard had been so profligate or so patriotic as the worthy member himself repeatedly and solemnly declared he was as to vote with the Minister who had previously given him a place and promised to secure his return for a Treasury borough Mr Evelyn knowing these circumstances was persuaded that the Baronet would be happy to find a representative for  his  constituents whose eloquence added to his own should avenge him on the Minister if not tumble him from the throne he had usurped  Mr Evelyn and the Baronet were on  intimate terms for Sir Barnard took a particular pleasure in every man who perfectly agreed with him in opinion and though this definition would not accurately apply to Mr Evelyn yet on the great leading points in politics they seldom differed  As to morals as a science Sir Barnard on many occasions would affect to treat it with that commonplace contempt which always accompanies the supposition of the original and unconquerable depravity of man of the verity of which the Baronet had a rooted conviction In this hypothesis he was but confirmed by his burgagetenure voters by the conduct of the members he had himself returned and by certain propensities which he felt in his own breast and which he seriously believed to be instinctive in man  Beside if Mr Evelyn differed at any time in opinion with a disputant the suavity of his manners was so conciliatory  that opposition from him was sometimes better received than agreement and coincidence from other people This suavity by the by is a delightful art Would it were better understood and more practised  CHAP IV  SAGE REMARKS ON THE SEDUCTION OF YOUNG ORATORS THE INFLUENCE OF THE CROWN AND THE CORRUPTION OF OUR GLORIOUS CONSTITUTION OLD AND NEW NOBILITY POOR OLD ENGLAND NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS THE MAN WITH AN IMPENETRABLE FACE  FULL of the project he had conceived Mr Evelyn visited the Baronet who happened to be in town and proposed it to him in the manner which he thought might most prepossess him in my favour  Sir Barnard listened attentively and paused  It happened that he had lately been  meditating on the danger of introducing young orators into parliament for he had found by experience that they are so marketable a commodity as to be almost certain of being bought up The trick he had himself been played was bitterly remembered and he had known and heard of several instances during his parliamentary career of a similar kind  Yet he could not but recollect that when he and his former spokesman had entered the house arm in arm there was a sort of buzz and a degree of respect paid to him which had instantly diminished as soon as this support was gone  There is something of dignity in the use of crutches and he that cannot walk alone commands attention from his imbecility  "I do not know what to think of this plan" said the Baronet "I find your flowery speakers are no more to be depended  upon in the present day than the oldest drudges in corruption  "You know cousin how I hate corruption It is undoing us all It will undo the nation The influence of the crown is monstrous The aristocracy is degraded by annual batches of mundungus and parchment lords and the constitution is tumbling about our ears The old English spirit is dead The nation has lost all sense and feeling The people are so vile and selfish that they are bought and sold like swine to which for my part I think they have been very properly compared There is no such thing now as public virtue No no That happy time is gone by Every man is for all he can get and as for the means he cares nothing about them There is absolutely no such thing as patriotism existing and to own the truth damn me if I believe there is a man in the kingdom that cares one farthing  for those rights and liberties about which so many people that you and I know pretend to bawl"  "This is a severe supposition indeed It implicates your dearest and most intimate friends Only recollect Sir Barnard what would your feelings be if the same thing should be asserted of you"  "Of me truly No no cousin Evelyn I think I have been pretty tolerably tried The Minister knows very well he could move the Monument sooner than me I love the people and am half mad to see that they have no love for themselves Why do not they meet Why do not they petition Why do not they besiege the throne with their clamors They are no better than beasts of burthen If they were any thing else the whole kingdom would rise as one man and drive this arrogant upstart from the helm I say Mr Evelyn I love the people I love my country I love the  constitution and I hate the swarms of mushroom peers and petty traders that are daily pouring in upon us to overturn it"  Was it weakness of memory Was it the blindness of egotism Or was it inordinate stupidity that Sir Barnard should forget as he constantly did that his father had been a common porter in a warehouse had raised an immense fortune by trade had purchased the boroughs which descended to his son and had himself been bought with the title of Baronet by a former minister Was it so very long ago that Sir Barnard with such a swell of conscious superiority should begin to talk of the antiquity of his family But above all how did he happen not to recollect that the disappointment which now preyed upon and cankered his heart was the refusal of a peerage  I really can give no satisfactory answer  to these questions I can only state a fact which daily occurs in a thousand other instances  Mr Evelyn brought the Baronet back to the point and remarked to him that at the present period when the Minister was so powerful in numbers to bring in a mere yes and no member with himself would be a certain mode of not serving the country the constitution and the people whom he so dearly loved that the safety which is derived from a man's insignificance is but a bad pledge and that he thought himself very certain I was as dear nay and as incorruptible a lover of old England or at least of the welfare of mankind as Sir Barnard himself  "Shew me such a man cousin" exclaimed the Baronet "and I will worship him I will worship him Mr Evelyn I will worship him But I am persuaded he is not to be found I have learned from too fatal experience that I am certain of nobody  but myself Small as the number in Opposition is if they were but all as soundhearted as I am and would set their shoulders to the wheel and lay themselves out for the good of their country as I do I say it Mr Evelyn and take my word for it I say true we should overturn the Minister and his corrupt gang in six months Nay in half the time However as you are so strongly persuaded of the soundness of the gentleman's principles whom you recommend let me see him and talk to him and then I will tell you more of my opinion"  "There is one point Sir Barnard on which I suppose I need not insist it is so obvious"  "What is that cousin"  "You being as you state a man of principle and incapable of being biassed to act against what you conceive to be the good of the nation you must expect that every man who resembles you in  patriotism and fortitude will act from himself and will resist any attempt to control him"  "Oh as to that we need say nothing about it Those things are never mentioned nowadays they are perfectly understood But who is your young friend Is he a man of property"  "No"  He will be the more manageable thought Sir Barnard  "Where will he get a qualification"  "I will provide him with one"  "You say he is a gentleman"  "As I understand the term he certainly is for in addition to those manners and accomplishments which are most pleasing to the world he not only possesses a good education but a sense of justice which makes him regard every man as his brother and which will neither suffer him to crouch to the haughty nor trample on the poor"  "Why that is very good Very right I myself will crouch to no man And as for modesty and humility in the youth of the present day why they are very rarely found and so I shall be happy to meet with them"  "Nay but Mr Trevor delivers his sentiments with rather an unguarded freedom and with peculiar energy or indeed he would be ill qualified to rise in the assembly of which I wish to see him a member and undauntedly oppose the arrogant assertions that are there daily made"  "Arrogant G confound me Mr Evelyn if I am not sometimes struck dumb with what I hear in that house There is that Scotchman in particular who will get up after our allies have been defeated our troops driven like sheep from swamp to swamp where they die of the rot and our ships carried by hundreds into the enemy's ports and  will roundly assert notwithstanding these facts are as notorious as his own political profligacy that our victories are splendid our armies undiminished and our trade protected and flourishing beyond all former example He makes my hair stand on end to hear him And when I look in his face and see the broad familiar easy impudence with which he laughs at me and all of us for our astonishment why as I tell you damn me if I am not dumbfounded I am struck all of a heap I have not a word I am choaked with rage and amazement Compared to him your brothelkeeper is a modest person Were but our fortresses as impenetrable as his forehead curse me if they would ever be taken He is bombproof The returns that lie on the table can make no impression upon him and you may see him snèer and laugh if they are pointed to in the course of an argument  "In short cousin Evelyn the nation  is ruined I see that clear enough Our constitution will soon be changed to a pure despotism Barracks are building soldiers line our streets our commission of the peace is filled with the creatures of a corrupt administration constables are only called out to keep up the farce and we are at present under little better than a military government"  Though Mr Evelyn would have been better satisfied had Sir Barnard's sense of national grievances been equally strong but less acrimonious yet he was pleased to find that these grievances were now more than ever become a kind of commonplace bead roll of repetitions of which their being so familiarly run over by the Baronet was sufficient proof for a people that are continually talking of the evils that afflict them are not as Sir Barnard and others have supposed dead to these evils The nation that remarks  discusses and complains of its wrongs will finally have them redressed  CHAP V  SERIOUS DOUBTS ON SERIOUS SUBJECTS PERSONAL QUALMS AND CONSIDERATIONS AN INTERVIEW WITH SIR BARNARD FEARS AND PRECAUTIONS OR A BURNT CHILD DREADS THE FIRE  WHAT farther passed in the conversation I have recited was of little moment except that an appointment was made on the following day for me to be introduced to the Baronet  Thus far successful Mr Evelyn returned and as he was a man of a firm and ingenuous mind he thought it adviseable to hold a consultation with me and my friends on the prosecution of his plan  That personal considerations might in no degree influence the enquiry he first proposed the question without intimating to what it might lead of"how far it became a virtuous man to accept a seat on those conditions under which a seat only can be obtained among the representatives of the people"  Without wearying the reader with the arguments that were adduced let it suffice to inform him that we all agreed it was a very doubtful case that in this as in numerous other instances manners customs and laws obliged us to conform to many things which were odiously vicious and that to live in society and rigidly observe those rules of justice which would best promote the general happiness was speaking absolutely a thing impossible  Whether the greatest political characters would best fulfil their duties by refusing to submit to the corrupt influence  of elections to testoaths and to the mischiefs of ministerial management within the walls or whether they ought to comply with them and exert their utmost faculties in pointing out these evils and endeavouring to have them redressed was a point on which we all seemed to think the wisest men might suspend their judgment  In one thing we appeared to be entirely agreed which was that such pernicious practices were in all probability more frequently exposed and brought into public discussion through the medium of an assembly like this than they would be did no such assembly exist  Neither must I detail what afterward passed before I was brought to accept the proposal of Mr Evelyn It would be tedious  This proposal did not confine itself to the single act of giving me a seat in parliament and of furnishing me with a  qualification It insisted that the qualification should be a real and not a fictitious deed  To accept the actual possession of three hundred ayear as a bounty for which I could make no return was I own humiliating to my pride It made the question continually recur"Whether it did not give me the air of an impostor A kind of swindler of sentiment A pretender to superior virtue for the purpose of gratifying vice"  It seemed at a blow to rob me of all independence and leave me a manacled slave to the opinions not only of Mr Evelyn but by a kind of consignment of his relation the Baronet and even to both their humours  In fine it was a most painful sacrifice and required all the amenity and active friendship of Mr Evelyn to bring to my mind not only my duties but the power that I should have at any time of  resigning my seat returning the deeds and sheltering myself in my primitive poverty  To this I added a condition without which my refusal would have been absolute It was that I should give a deed of mortgage bearing interest to the full value of the lands assigned  I shall forbear to dwell on sensations that were very active at the moment which on one hand related to all that concerned Mr Evelyn my obligations and something like dependence and on the other to my sudden promised elevation toward the sphere in which my ambition was so eagerly desirous to move Neither will I insist on that which caused my heart to beat yet more high the approach that I thus made to the lovely object of all my wishes  Leaving this endless train of meditation I proceed to relate events as they occurred  I attended Mr Evelyn according to appointment and paid my respects to his cousin Sir Barnard Having engaged myself thus far I own I was sufficiently piqued to desire to make a favourable impression in which I was almost as successful as I myself had hoped  At the first sight of me the Baronet was prepossessed and when we entered into conversation and he gave me an opportunity of uttering my sentiments concerning men and measures I painted so forcibly that he was almost in raptures  The only circumstance in which I failed was my frequent interruption and impatience when he in turn began to declaim I had the vice of orators I heard no man's arguments or language that pleased me so well as my own I could not listen without an irritating anxiety that was for ever prompting me to supply a word suggest a thought or detect a blunder And to a man who  loves to make a speech it is intolerably mortifying to hear himself corrected and cut short in the middle of a sentence  However I was sufficiently guarded not to give any offence that was strong enough to be remembered and Sir Barnard was so thoroughly engrossed by the idea of the conspicuous figure which he and his new member should make in the house that he was absolutely impatient to secure me being fully persuaded that he had discovered a treasure of which now at a general election he was in considerable danger of being robbed  The only precaution he took was to draw from me repeated asseverations that I would not desert the cause of the people by which as I afterward found he understood his own private opinions and I that which he had literally expressed On this head he seemed never satisfied and the terms in which he spoke both of the member who had deserted him and  of all political tergiversation whatever were the bitterest that his memory could supply  CHAP VI  A DINNER PARTY AND FORTUNE IS GOOD HUMOUR THE OPERA HOUSE AND SMALL TALK SAGACIOUS FEMALE DISCOVERIES OLIVIA AND THE ART OF FASCINATING AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE SUDDENLY SEEN AND DREADED THOUGH DESPISED TIMELY RECOLLECTION THE OPERA GREAT ROOM AND MORE DISCOVERIES  THESE points settled the Baronet proposed to introduce me to his friends and connections particularly of the political kind For this purpose he began with inviting me and Mr Evelyn to dine with him on the Friday following when he was to have a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen but chiefly of such as agreed with him on public affairs  When the day came I was presented to  the company by the Baronet with encomiums and seated on the left of Lady Bray  A Scotch lord was on her right it being her ladyship's custom to divide the ladies and gentlemen  A young fellow properly introduced if he be new in the circles of fashion and possessed of a tolerable figure is in no danger of being ill received I had not indeed learned to be an adept at small talk a qualification which contemptible as it is will supply the want of every superior requisite whether of mind or person but I had an aptitude to oblige be attentive and speak the moment I found I had any thing to say  I had laid no plan on this occasion not having then read or not remembering I know not which Lord Chesterfield's sage reflections on the necessity of a statesman's being well with the ladies It happened however that on this occasion I was received with distinguished  marks of approbation by the dear angels from several of whom I received visitinginvitations  Music and the opera were among the topics on which they conversed I was found to be an amateur and Lady Bray was one of the dilettanti had concerts at her own house and a box at the opera to both of which she said I should at all times have free admission  This was too pleasing an offer to be refused and I willingly agreed to attend her ladyship the following evening and hear the charming music of  I Zingari in Fiera  by Paisiello  The opera season began rather early that year many families were not yet come to town we had little delay from the string of coaches and had her ladyship not provided against the misfortune by taking care to go more late than usual we should have been so unfashionable as  to have heard the first act As it was we arrived before it was over  The thing on which her ladyship bestowed her immediate attention was to examine by the aid of her operaglass which of the subscribers were in their boxes and how many of her particular friends were among them Politeness induced me to accompany her in this excursion of the eye for not to have listened to the names titles and ages of her friends with the births deaths marriages creations and presentations at court of them and their families of which materials small talk is chiefly if not wholly composed would have been the very highest defect in good breeding  Why yes Listen I did as long as I was able till my eyes tongue and faculties were all riveted to one spot  Her ladyship's box was near the centre She had carried my eye from box  to box completely along one side and had proceeded to about three of the opposite when she directed her glass to one with the owners of which she had no acquaintance but she knew the names of all for she had them engraved on her fan  That name was Mowbray And the persons in it were Hector his aunt and Olivia  I was silent gazing entranced Her ladyship had talked I know not how long and I had neither answered nor heard one word  "Bless me" said she "Mr Trevor why you are  absolutely  in a revery all of a sudden That Miss Mowbray I find is a very dangerous young lady for I am told that all the men are  positively  mad after her and here are you  absolutely  struck speechless What Not a word yet"  "I beg ten thousand pardons"  "Why this seems like love at first sight You are not acquainted I suppose with the Mowbrays"  "Yes my lady from my infancy"  "Oh oh Why then to be sure you are intimate with this beauty who  absolutely  eclipses us all I assure you she is  positively  the belle of the day I hear she has the very first offers But you are not silly enough to act the dying swain What no answer Well well I see how it is But as we never read in any of the morning papers of gentle youths who break their hearts for love in the present ungallant age you are in no great danger Though I think I never saw any creature look more like what I should suppose one of your true lovers to be than you did just now for beside your speechless attitude which was  absolutely  picturesque and significant you were  positively  pale and red and red and pale almost as fast as the ticking of my  watch And even yet you are  absolutely  provoking I cannot get a word from you"  "Your ladyship's raillery quite overpowers me"  "I declare I am  positively  surprised at what I have seen Had a stranger been all of a sudden struck the wonder would not have been  absolutely  so great but it is  positively  unaccountable in you who are a familiar acquaintance of the family"  "I cannot boast of that honor"  "No indeed Why do not you visit the Mowbrays"  "I do not"  "What you are a dangerous man and are forbidden the house Well I declare I shall  absolutely  know your whole history in five minutes without your having  positively  told me a word"  "Your ladyship has a lively imagination"  I have heard that the aunt is a very cautious  chaperon  But I tell you what I will be your friend The Mowbrays are lately become intimate with two families where I visit And I will  absolutely  take you with me on one of their public nights I will  positively"  This proposition was so grateful and my thanks were so much more prompt than my recollection that her ladyship was quite confirmed in her surmises and not a little pleased with her own talent at discovery  Her accusation however was very true All she could  positively  say could not  absolutely  draw my attention from the box of Olivia whose turns and motions I was anxiously watching hoping that some lucky accident would guide her eye toward me  Nay I partly hoped and partly feared the same of the aunt my emotions being now influenced by the respectable station  which I at present seemed to occupy and now by the rememberance that even this might turn to my disadvantage in the jealous apprehensions of the old lady  Busied as my thoughts were and absorbed in anxious attention this anxiety was soon overcome by a much more powerful feeling  A gentleman entered Olivia's box My eyes were instantly turned on him Recollection was roused My heart beat It surely was he I could not be mistaken My operaglass was applied and my fears confirmed It was indeed the Earl of Idford  Here then in a moment the enigma was solved The peer who had aspired to the hand of Olivia and who tempted her with all his opulence and all his dignity could be no other than Lord Idford He had long been intimate with Hector and now comes without ceremony and  joins the family See how the aunt smiles on him Nay mark Olivia is attentive to him Her lips move Her eyes are directed to his She is conversing with him and at her ease while I am racked by all the terrors that jealousy can raise What can she not cast one look this way Is she fascinated by a reptile Is there no instinctive sympathy that should make her tremble to betray the dearest interests of love in the very presence of the lover Does she act complacency and sit calm and unruffled Has she no foreboding that I will dart upon that insect that thing which being less than man presumes because it is called Lord Thinks she that I will not crush tear tread him to dust He the defrauder of my fair fame who plundered me of the first fruits of genius by infamous falsehood who joined in plotting my destruction by arts which the basest cowards blush at  Is he the fiend that comes to snatch me from bliss and plunge me into pangs and horrors unutterable  From these ravings of the mind I was a little recovered by the very serious alarm which the wild changes of my countenance produced in Lady Bray I apologised pleaded indisposition but presently was lost again in revery Fortunately a gentleman of her ladyship's acquaintance came into the box and left me to continue my embittered meditations  Olivia was now attentive to the music and the lord had only her aunt and Hector apparently to bestow his conversation upon  This was some relief and so far allayed the fever of my mind as to call me back to self examination and to question my own conduct  For the earl I could not but have the most rooted contempt I could not compare  myself with him and entertain a doubt concerning who ought to be preferred  But what reason had I to accuse Olivia What did these angry emotions of my soul forebode Perhaps that my habitual irritability were she mine would make her miserable  What was the end of existence Happiness Had I not a right then to be happy Yes But so had she So had her aunt Nay so had that rival odious and despicable as he was whose appearance had raised this tempest in my soul  But was constraint was force justifiable in this aunt or in this insignificant this selfish lord  Force it is said is the law of nature and it is that law which impels the ravenous tiger to spring upon the lamb and suck its blood to appease his craving appetite But if so if selfgratification were a defensible motive the detestable  Norman robber the monster who inhabited a cave and seized on every stray virgin to deflower murder her and prey on her remains was justifiable  In the agitated mind dreams like these are endless While they were passing I stared with fixed attention toward Olivia and had she not been almost motionless my passive trances could not have continued  The first dance was over the second act had begun more visitors came to pay their respects to Lady Bray and I endeavoured to recollect myself and shake off a behaviour that might well be construed inattention if not ill manners and might injure me even in that point on which I was then so deeply intent I uttered two or three sentences and her ladyship complimented me on being once more awake  The persevering attention of Olivia to the scene for it was impossible to forbear  glancing at her every moment contributed to calm my fears  It did more it was a most beneficial lesson to me It called me again to the consideration of that impetuosity of temper which was so dangerous in me Into what acts of frenzy and desperation might not these fevers of the soul hurry me What in the present instance could I urge to justify such excess Had I not heard the reproaches of her aunt for her having refused the hand of this Lord if this Lord it should happen to be When he entered the box what had she done that should excite such frantic ecstacies in me What except return those civilities without which it is impossible for man or woman to be amiable Did she now coquet prattle and display her power tempted as she was by such a public scene of triumph Was not her demeanour as chastely cautious as my own exigent heart could desire  Every question that the facts before me suggested was an aggravating reproof of my headlong passions and luckily for me my thoughts took that train which was most corrective and healthful They led me too to dwell with a melting and mild rapture on the endearing virtues of Olivia dignified yet not austere firm yet not repulsive circumspect yet capable of all those flowing affections without which circumspection is but meanness  Nor were these visionary attributes such as the disordered imagination of a lover falsely bestows They were as real as those personal beauties by which they were embellished  To aspire to the possession of a woman so gifted and to be the lunatic which my own reproaches at this moment pictured me was to demand that which I did not deserve To be worthy of her it was fit I should resemble her  I endeavoured to obey these admonitions I schooled myself concerning my remissness to Lady Bray I recovered my temper became attentive talked rather pleasantly and reestablished myself in her good graces in which I could perceive I had somewhat declined by the folly of my behaviour To remind the reader on every occasion of the progress of intellect and the benefits derived from experience would be to weary his patience insult his understanding and counteract my own intentions It would suppose in him a total absence of observation and reasoning Yet to be entirely silent might lead the young and the inattentive to imagine I had in the beginning proposed a mode of instruction which as I proceeded I had either forgotten abandoned or had not the power to execute If such will attend to the alteration in my conduct they will perceive that I like every other human being could  not but reflect more or less on the motives that actuated me and profit by the lessons I received though rooted habits and violent passions were the most difficult to cure  After the curtain dropped I accompanied Lady Bray into the great room and perceived among the throng at some little distance Olivia and her aunt attended by the peer  I had foreseen the possibility of this and had reasoned that there might be more danger in an abrupt rencontre of this kind than in meeting Olivia and her terrible aunt at the house of Lady Bray's friend as her ladyship had promised me where I should receive her countenance and that of the family to which I should be introduced I therefore endeavoured to direct her ladyship's attention from the place where the Mowbray party was and succeeded in my endeavours  Soon afterward I saw Hector with  a knot of fashionable youths among whom I was rather surprised to discover my at that time unknown fatherinlaw Belmont  I had no inclination to be noticed by this groupe and as Lady Bray's carriage was presently afterward  stopping the way  I had the good fortune to escape unperceived or at least unaccosted by both parties  CHAP VII  A DEBT DISCHARGED A TAVERN DINNER AND A DISSERTATION THE MAN OF THE WORLD RIDICULING THE MAN OF VIRTUE OR IS HONESTY THE BEST POLICY FOOLS PAY FOR BEING FLATTERED SECURITY ESSENTIAL TO HAPPINESS A TRIUMPHANT RETORT AND DIFFICULT TO BE ANSWERED VICE INEVITABLE UNDER A VITIATED SYSTEM A DANGEROUS ATTACK OR AN EXHIBITION OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL ARTS OF A GAMBLER A FEW CANT PHRASES  TO the friendship of Mr Evelyn I had so far subjected myself and the spirit of independence which I was very properly ambitious to cherish as for the present to accept the aid he was so desirous to bestow I was something like compelled to be his debtor but was unwilling to be the debtor of any other man on earth and as he had enabled me to appear in the style I have described and furnished me with money I was determined to seek  out Belmont and discharge the debt which his bounty had conferred after he had previously plundered me at Bath He had sunk in my esteem I now considered him as a professed gambler but I remembered this action as that which it really was an effort of benevolence to aid a human being in distress  Thus actuated I went the next day to the billiardtable which he had been accustomed to frequent where I once more found him at play He met me not only unabashed but with something like cordiality He had so accustomed himself to his own hypothesis that "selfgratification is the law of nature" and had so confused a sense of what true selfgratification is with such an active faculty of perverting facts and exhibiting pictures of general turpitude that he had very little sense of the vice of his own conduct and was therefore very little subject to selfreproof He behaved to me with the  utmost ease and good humour and when his match was over proposed that we should dine together at the Thatchedhouse  For a moment I questioned the propriety of assenting but seeing him now as before familiar with the officers of the guards and people of whose company no one was ashamed and recollecting where and how I had seen him the evening before I did not long hesitate Beside which I was prompted not only by the pleasure which his conversation gave but by an increase of curiosity to be better acquainted with who and what he really was  As soon as we were alone I discharged my conscience by repaying him the twenty pounds This gave occasion to the following dialogue  "I perceive Trevor you are still the fame You pique yourself on paying your borrowings Had it been a debt of honour  indeed I should not have been surprised for those are debts that must be discharged Otherwise it would introduce a very inconvenient practice indeed"  "I believe as you say it would be inconvenient beyond description to you What do you call yourselvesOh I recollect 'sporting gentlemen' is the phrase It would be inconvenient I say to you sporting gentlemen"  "Whom when we sporting gentlemen are absent you call blacklegs rooks Grecians and other pleasant epithets Some such word I could perceive was quivering on your tongue You remember the plucking you had at Bath and though you are too much ashamed of having been duped to mention it yet it remains on your mind with a feeling of resentment That is natural but it is foolish"  "Is it foolish to have a sense of right and wrong"  "Where is that sense to be found Who has it I have continually a sense if so you please to call it that there is something which I want and by that I am impelled to act"  "True But Locke I think tells us that crime consists in not taking sufficient time to consider before we act"  "And begging his pardon wise as in a certain sense I allow you this Locke was in the instance you have cited he was an ass If I do not mistake he has before proved to me that I cannot act without a motive and then he bids me stop when I am in such a hurry that no motive occurs to my memory"  "According to this an actual murderer is not a more guilty man than he who only dreams that he commits murder"  "Make what you will of the inference  but it is accurate They are both dead asleep to any ideas except those that hurry them forward"  "That is in plain English there is no such thing as vice"  "Might you not as well have said as virtue"  "Speaking absolutely I do not pretend to deny what you assert But you will not tell me that the man who robs me and leaves me bound to a tree in danger of starving has not done me an injury"  "Will you be kind enough to shew me who it is among those who have any thing to lose that does not rob Men who enjoy the pleasures of life rob those who are deprived of them of their due and according to my apprehension the latter have a right to make reprisals"  "Upon my soul Belmont you have a most inveterate habit of confounding every thing that should guide and regulate  mankind You shift the question confound terms and are the most desperate gladiator of vice I ever encountered Your dangerous genius is a mine where the ore is rich indeed but the poisonous vapour that envelopes it deadly"  "Each to his system We have both the voyage of life to make You place that very sober and discreet person called Honesty at the helm by the single direction of whom you expect to attain happiness which is just as rational as to hope to circumnavigate the globe with one wind I take a different course it is my maxim to shift my sails and steer as pleasure and interest bid"  "Acting as you do I cannot wonder that you should make a jest of honesty"  "Upon my honour I treated Sir Honesty with every possible decorum till I found that the insidious rascal was making a jest of me Not that I am quite certain I am not more truly the friend of  this very respectable person than those who pretend they are always in his company for I neither cant with Madam Morality nor pray with Dame Methodism though I cannot but think I am almost as religious as moral ay and as charitable too as your devotees and sabbathkeepers who go to church to pray and be saved and leave their servants to stay at home roast the meat and be damned"  "I must again repeat you have the most active fertility at embroiling all order and system I have any where met with"  "Ha ha ha Order and system are very pretty words But you make a small mistake It is not I that embroil I find confusion already established and since I cannot correct it give me a reason why I ought not to profit by the chaotic hubbub"  "But I say you can correct it You  are one of the men who might have been best fitted for the task"  "I know not what I might have been but I feel that I am not The first right of man ay and to talk in your own idiom the first moral duty too is to be happy and he is an idiot that having a banquet spread before him forbears to taste because he himself is not the purveyor What matters it to me how it came there Why am I to be excluded Have I not as exquisite a relish as he that provided for the bill of fare  "Let dull fools puzzle their brain concerning moral fitness which they have not elevation enough of mind to understand give me enjoyment  "Let me eat the pine apple while they are discussing the moral fitness of feasting on such luxuries"  "This doctrine would subject the world to your appetites and pleasures"  "And is not that a noble doctrine  It is the wish and passion of the world to be gulled and gulled let it be Let it have its enjoyments give me mine  "One man is my banker and is assiduously careful to keep cash at my command which he transfers to me in the most gentlemanlike and honourable manner imaginable namely by a box and dice  "Another is my steward and he lays out my grounds stocks my park with deer builds me palaces erects me hothouses and torments heaven and earth to furnish my table with delicacies for all of which I pay him in the current coin of flattery It is true I permit him to call these things his own but the real enjoyment of them is notoriously mine He poor egotist talks bombast and nonsense by wholesale I applaud and smile at his folly while he imagines it is at his wit The poor man is amused with fine speeches unsubstantial flatteries cringes  bows and hypocritical tokens of servility which are so many jests upon him  "Thus is he mocked with the shadow while I banquet upon the substance I bask in arbours and groves without once having given myself a thought concerning planting or pruning I feast on the fish without so much as the trouble of catching them and still less of constructing the pond By the provision he makes that is by avarice and extortion he nurtures a brood of sycophants and slaves Wife children friends servants all have the same character only differently shaded except that if any of them can become his tyrants and tormentors they all are ready for the task I have studied the noble arts both of tickling and tormenting by which I have subjected this very selfimportant race to my will and pleasure"  "For a man whose acuteness has carried him so very far I am amazed that it did  not impel him to advance one step farther Happiness is what I and all men desire as certainly as you do but that happiness is of a strange kind and held by a frail and feeble tenure that is agitated by innumerable fears that if the means on which it depends be detected is wholly destroyed and that when lost finds infamy and misery its certain substitutes  "Mark what I say and mark it deeply There can be no happiness without security and there can be no security without sincerity Therefore hypocrites of every class are acting contrary to their own intentions They are providing misery for themselves as well as for others instead of the substantial pleasures of which they are in search"  "Indeed The Lord have mercy then upon all establishments legal political and ecclesiastic"  "Let me farther observe to you that the system of general enjoyment which  you propose is something if I may so call it more than rational it is dignified it is sublime I feel with you that he is a poor circumscribed egotist who can enjoy nothing but that which he calls his own Let me taste every blessing which the hand of nature presents let me banquet with you on her bounties but let me not embitter the delicious repast by fraud that enslaves me to an eternal watchfulness depredation that puts even my life in jeopardy and a system founded in lies and everlastingly haunted by the spectres of selfcontempt"  Our dialogue was interrupted by the entrance of the waiters  When we had dined Belmont began to enquire concerning my prospects and affairs  "I expect" said he "you will be less communicative and open hearted now than you formerly were You have discovered what I never attempted to conceal that my present dependence is on  the exercise of talents which your gravity despises especially since they have laid you under contribution This misfortune however had you possessed them despicable as they are you would have escaped"  "Yes just as the man who hanged himself last night escaped a headach this morning I will own to you I cannot take the pleasure in your company or think of you with that friendship which I formerly felt for though I find your conversation no less animating like strong liquors it leaves an unwholesome heat behind  "However I have no objection to inform you that fortune has given me a momentary respite from persecution How soon she may think proper to stretch me on the rack again is more than I can foresee though I greatly suspect her of cruelty and caprice She seems at present to be in one of her best humours and has given me a kind of  promise to make me one of the sage legislators of this happy land"  "What do you mean"  "That I shall be a member of the new parliament"  Belmont burst into a violent fit of laughter At first I was at a loss to conjecture why and especially why it should be so long and so unaffected but I soon learned it was a burst of triumph which he could not restrain  "I congratulate you Mr Trevor" said he with a momentary gravity "on your noble and moral pursuitsThe lecture you have been reading as well as those I have formerly heard you read now come upon me with invincible force There is no resisting precept thus exemplified by practiceHow loud how lofty how sovereign is the contempt in which you hold hypocrisyHow severe will the laws be that you will enact against petty depredatorsI foresee you  will hang not only those that handle a card or a dicebox but those that make themThen what honors what rewards what triumphs will you decree to your own wholesale marauders your great captains chosen empowered and paid by yourself and sages no less moral and disinterestedWith what gusto will you send him to swing who commits a single robbery and with what sublime oratory will you exalt the prowess of the man who has plundered starved and exterminated nations"A Daniel come to judgment Oh wise young judge how do I honor thee"  I remained speechless a few moments and entirely disconcerted I was irritated though I knew not precisely at what I attempted to answer but was so confused that I talked absolute nonsense  After some time however I recollected that my purpose in going into parliament was to counteract all these  abuses I then recovered my faculties and urged this plea very emphatically  Still the moral dignity and virtue of the honourable house I was about to enter dwelt with such force on the imagination of Belmont that I could get no reply from him except sarcasms such as those I have repeated with the same intervening fits of laughter as the images suggested themselves to his mind  And here lest the reader himself should be misled like Belmont I must remark that no mistake is more common and I believe none more pernicious than that of imagining that because man has not attained absolute and perfect virtue the very existence of virtue is doubtful  Hence it happens that he who in any manner participates in the vices of a nation or a body of men is reproached as if loaded with the whole guilt  Hence likewise because men without exception are more or less tainted with  error all pretensions to superior moral principles are laughed at as false and ridiculous  This is the doctrine at least which the people who most offend these principles are the most zealous in propagating Belmont had no refuge against selfreproach but in cherishing such trains of thought  That the vices which are the most despised in society instead of being the most despicable are virtues if compared to actions that find honor and reward is a truth too glaring to be denied That the cant with which these master crimes are glossed over and painted as just expedient ay and heroic actions that this diabolical cant should be and is adopted by men even of the highest powers is a fact that astonishes and confounds It impels us continually to ask Are they cowards Are they hypocrites Or is the world inhabited by  none but lunatics And that men even of such uncommon genius as Belmont should be entangled and bewildered by the destructive incongruity of those who assume to themselves the highest wisdom because they possess the highest stations in society is a proof how incumbent it is on such as are convinced of these melancholy truths to declare them openly undauntedly and with a perseverance that no threats or terrors can shake  When we had taken as much wine as Belmont could prevail on me to drink and he was very urgent he asked if I played Piquet  I answered in the affirmative  "You no doubt then play it well"  "I do not think it a game of much difficulty"  "It is my opinion I am your master at it"  "That may be"  "Though you do not think it is Will you try"  "What with a man who avows he does not scruple to take every advantage"  "Have you not eyes Are you a metaphysician a wit and a senator so easily deceived"  "A man may lose his temper and with it his caution"  "So you think yourself able to instruct the world but not to keep your mind calm and circumspect for half an hour"  "Had I a sufficient motive I should suppose I have strength enough for such an exertion"  "Then try The exercise will be wholesome Shew your skill and acuteness Here is your twentypound bill win and take it or own that you have no confidence in yourself"  "I have that confidence which assures  me I shall one day or other convince you that I understand the road to happiness better than yourself"  "Yet you are cursedly afraid of me You scarcely can sit still You blame your own rashness in venturing to spend the afternoon with me and now you would as soon handle burning coals as a pack of cards in my company"  "And what is it you find so omnipotent in yourself that it should induce you to all this vapouring"  "I tell you again you dare not oppose your penetration to mine You pretend to despise me yet own I am your master A child is not in more fear of the rod than you are of me"  He saw he had sufficiently piqued me and rang the bell for cards They were brought he shuffled cut them and continued to banter me  "What card do you chuseThe knave of heartsThere it is" He  shewed it with a flirt of the cards at the bottom of the pack His brother of diamondsLook You have itOf spadesPresto It is here You have three knaves on your side you see I will keep the fourth and drive you out of the fieldCome for twenty"  "I see your aim and am devilishly tempted to shew you that you are not half so cunning as you think yourself"  "I know you are but you dare not You cannot shake off your fears The wit the metaphysician the young senator suspects he is only a halffledged bird"  "Cut for deal sir"  "Why will you ventureThe nine"  The sudden recollection of Mr Evelyn the money I had received from him the generous confidence he had reposed in me and the guilt of daring to abuse that confidence fortunately seized me  with a kind of horror I snatched up the cards dashed them in the fire and in a moment recovering myself said"You shall find sir that whether I can or cannot master you I can master myself"  "Come you do not go out of this room without the  chance  of losing twenty guineas for twenty"  "Done" answered I impetuously which he in an instant echoed with Done Done and again bursting into laughter held out his hand and bade me pay my losings  I immediately discovered without his explanation that he had entrapped me by the equivocal sense of the word  chance  and I drew out my purse to pay him with a strong feeling of indignation that I should be so caught  However as it was not his intention to profit by so bald and barefaced a quirk he only laughed and exclaimed"How much the young gentleman is his own  master But I will not pick your pocket If at any time I should want twenty pounds I shall have a fair claim to ask it as a loan"  "Would you but really act like a man of honour there would be no need of such an artifice"  "Perhaps not for the first time But if my poor honor were starving and could not repay its borrowings I am afraid my honor would irrevocably be lost I therefore prefer since in either case lose it I must to lose it and eat But the birds are now beginning to flock together and I must begone to the pigeonhouse the rookery"  "I do not understand the terms"  "The plucking office the crab and nick nest the pip and bone quarry the rafflearium the trumpery the blaspheming box the elbow shaking shop the wholesale ague and fever warehouse"  "In plain English to an assembly of gamblers"  "Where I shall meet with much the same degree of honesty virtue wisdom and all that as is to be found in certain other assemblies"  CHAP VIII  BAD COMPANY PAINFUL AS WELL AS DANGEROUS A SHORT NOTE EXCITING MUCH EXPECTATION A QUESTION THAT SHOCKS AND SURPRISES CLARKE AND OLIVIA OR THE OVERFLOWING OF A FULL AND FRIENDLY HEART VARIOUS MISTAKES RECTIFIED THE READING OF THE LETTER AND THE EMOTIONS IT PRODUCES RESOLUTIONS WORTHY OF VIRTUOUS LOVE  I LEFT the tavern in no very pleasant temper of mind impatient that I should be unable to convince and reform a man of such extraordinary acuteness as Belmont vexed that he on the contrary should persuade himself that he was my  master and should actually irritate me to a dangerous excess of vanity and disgusted that vice and virtue should be so confused in the minds of men as to render their boundaries almost undiscoverable  Such I mean was the impression that Belmont had left upon my mind by repeating the stale but dangerous maxim thatmen are vicious by nature and therefore that to profit by their vices is no more than just  When I arrived at my lodgings which were now in Albemarlestreet for I had changed them I found the following note from Miss Wilmot  "Come to me immediately I have something to tell you which you little expect"  Belmont and my chagrin were forgotten in an instant and away I hurried brim full of agitation conjecture and impatience  I found Miss Wilmot alone and her first words were"Oh Mr Trevor you are a happy man"  I stood panting or rather gasping with hope and made no reply She thus continued  "Miss Mowbray has been here"  "Good heavens"  "She has acted like herself I know not how I shall tell you the story so as to do her justice"  "For the love of God proceed"  "As nearly as I can recollect her words she began in this manner"  'I cannot tell my dear friend' addressing herself to me 'what you will think of my conduct At one moment I suspect it to be wrong and at the next blame myself for not having taken my present step sooner I have surely been grossly misled This indeed I have long suspected and it cannot but be my duty to enquire Have you lately seen Mr Trevor'  'I never fail to see him every day I have a letter from him for you which he has disdained to take any clandestine means of conveying to you Here it is'  'Before I dare think about his letter answer me one question Is he a murderer'  'A murderer In the name of God what can induce you to make such an enquiry'  'I have been assured that he has caused the death of two men one of whom he killed himself'  'Where When How'  'At Bath By delivering one over to the fury of the mob and by afterward provoking insulting and fighting with the other'  'Heavens and earth It is false wickedly false'  'Nay but do you know his story'  'Perfectly I have heard it not only  from himself but from the man whom I suppose you have been told he has murdered'  'What man'  'Nay you shall hear and see You shall have the whole history from the person's own mouth'  'Is he alive Is he in London'  'I will send for him He will be here in a few minutes You will then hear what this man has to say He almost adores Mr Trevor'  "I immediately dispatched Mary for Mr Clarke who works not far off as I suppose you know and who came running the moment he heard that the lady you are in love with enquired for him  "Mary informs me that his heart leaped to his eyes it was her own phrase when he was told she wanted to question him concerning you that he sprang up clapped his hands and exclaimed'I  am glad of it I am glad of it The time is come All shall be known He shall be righted I will take care of that He shall be righted'  "He entered the room breathless and the moment he saw Miss Mowbray he could not forbear to gaze at her though bashfulness made him continually turn his eyes away  "She addressed him with that mildness of manner which is so winning in her and said'I have taken the liberty sir to send for you to ask a few questions'  "He replied with a burst of zeal 'I am glad of it madam I am glad of it from my heart and soul I wish you knew all I could tell you about Mr Trevor but it is quite unpossible that I should remember it one half Only this I will say and dare the best man in England to deny it there is not such another brave and kindhearted gentleman walks the earth I have had proof enough of  it He knows for all he is a gentleman ay and a true gentleman too for he has parts and learning and a christian soul which does not teach him to scorn and make a scoff of the poor he knows that a man is a man even though he should only happen to be a poor carpenter like myself God in heaven bless him say I'  "The enthusiasm of your generous humble friend overpowered Miss Mowbray she burst into tears and hid her face Her passion was catching and I followed her example Clarke continued  'On that night that he had the good hap to save your life and the life of that old cankered lady which as I find from all that passed she must be though he talks of her too kindly by half why the stopping of the frightened horses just do you see in the jaws of destruction and propping the coach was all his doing He knew better what he was about than the coachman himself And then if  you had seen him as I did after all was over I thought I had loved my Sally dearly And so I do But what am I I thought too I durst have stood up to the boldest man that ever stood on shoe leather And perhaps I durst but I find I am nothing in any case to  be  For which he never despises me but insists upon it that I am as good a man as he in any way And as for you madam he would jump into burning lakes rather than a hair of your head should be singed I know it for I have seen it'  'I know it too' said Miss Mowbray sobbing Then with an effort to quell her passion she asked in a firmer tone 'Pray sir tell me did not you work at Bath'  'Yes madam the greatest part of my life'  'You appear to know of a battle that Mr Trevor fought'  'Yes yes madam I know it pretty  well I shall remember it as long as I live for more reasons than one'  'Was there a man killed'  'No madam God be praised I should have died in my sins unprepared and wicked as I was being possessed with passion He God bless him for all he is a gentleman begged my pardon like a man and held out his hand and prayed over and over that I would forget and forgive But as I tell you I was possessed I could be nothing else because in the way of hard fighting I despised a gentleman But he gave me to know better as obstinate as I was for even after he had beaten me once why he begged and prayed as he had done at first to make it all up But as I said before the Evil One had taken hold of me and I refused to give in till I was carried as dead as a stock off of the place'  'Then it was you that was reported to have been killed'  'Why yes madam because it could be nobody else'  'Nay but was not there a poor man ducked to death'  'No God be thanked once again It was not quite so bad as that Though the hotheaded fools and rabble that got hold of me did use me ill enough I must say for which I was so angry with Mr Trevor and it was therefore that Old Nick put it into my head that I would beat him For I cannot deny but the ducking did dwell upon my memory'  'Were you then the same person that was so ill treated at Lansdown races'  'Yes madam for which though I used to be angry enough before time at pickpockets I will take special care never to have a hand in ducking any body as long as I live'  'And is there no truth whatever in  the story that two men were killed by the ungovernable passion and malice of Mr Trevor'  'Killed by Mr Trevor madam No no He is not that sort of man He would rather be killed himself than be the death of any christian soul 'specially if he was a poor body I can say that for him Why he fought like a mad man to save me from the mob when they were hustling me and dragging me along But while one part of them gathered round him the other had got far enough off with me It being all a mistake about a handkerchief which he told them And though I heard him and saw him beat about just as if he had been a lion to save me I could not forget how I had been used when I met him the next day But I hope God will forgive me which I do believe he will for Mr Trevor has shewn him the example I beg pardon God forgive me  I only mean that though Mr Trevor is a good gentleman the Lord of heaven must be a better and even more charitable and melting in his heart Which to be sure is very strange because I do not altogether understand how it can be'  'Then it seems your brother is still living'  'Brother madam I never had any brother nor any thing of that kind except my wife's sisters  which  I love because I love  she  '  'What strange tales I have been told'  'That I dare be sworn you have madam from what I have heard Because there was the shamAbraham friends of Mr Trevor one of  which  kicked him when he was down'  'Is it possible'  'It is as true as God is in heaven madam'  'Do you know his name'  'He was as tall as a Maypole And then after he had done this cowardly trick why he durst not stand up to Mr Trevor like a man And so madam finding as you have been told a parcel of trumpery tales I hope in God you will be kind enough not to believe one of them now that you see they are all false For if there be a gentleman on the face of the earth that loves a lady to desperation why Mr Trevor is he as you would have been satisfied if you had  set  by his bedside when as he was down in the fever like as I and my Sally did and had heard him rave of nobody but you And then if you had seen him too the night after he took you out of the coach and then went on to Hounslow Which as he said seeing it was parting with you was worse than tearing his heart out of his body But he was so afraid of doing you harm and of setting that cross old lady to scold you For he would suffer death rather  than anger you So that while I have breath to draw I shall never forget when we came to the inn how he looked and stood quite lost and changing colour and while his face was as set as stone the tears kept trickling down his cheeks At which I was put into a panic for I did not at that time know what it was about nor who we had been in company with Which was the more surprising when I came to hear For which as he knows you to be so good a lady I am sure you must see all these particulars just in the same light'  "Miss Mowbray had heard sufficient Her heart was bursting It was with difficulty she could check her feelings and she made no reply Your unassuming but intelligent friend understood her silence as an intimation to him to withdraw Zealous as you hear he was in your behalf this thought put an end to his loquacity But as he was retiring  Miss Mowbray drew out her purse and said to him'Let me beg you sir to accept this as a recompense forfor having aided in saving the lives of me and my aunt'  "As she stretched out her hand he looked up at her as long as he durst and then turning his eyes away said 'Why as for money madam I thank you as much as if I had it but if I was to take it what would that seem but as if I had been telling a tale only to please you when I declare in the face of my Maker it is every word truth And a great deal more And as for saving your lives I was as willing I own as another but I was not half so quick in thought as Mr Trevor Because as the coachman said if he had not catched hold of the horses in that very instant nick of the moment it would have been all over So I hope madam you will not take it  amiss that I am not one of the sort  which  tell tales to gain their own ends'  "Here he instantly left the room by which he intended to shew that he was determined  "Clarke was no sooner gone than Miss Mowbray burst into the most passionate and I really believe the most rapturous flood of tears that the heart of woman ever shed And how melting how overflowing with affection the heart of woman is Mr Trevor I think you know  "Good God How pure how expressive how beaming was the pleasure in her eyes though she sobbed so violently that she had lost all utterance How did she press my hand gaze at me then bury her face in my bosom and struggle with the pleasure that was becoming dangerous in its excess  "After some time her thoughts took  another turn She instantly recovered the use of speech and exclaimed'Oh my friend I almost hate myself for the injustice which I as well as others have done Mr TrevorI who had heard from his lips a thousand sentiments that ought to have assured me of the generous and elevated virtues by which his actions were directed He has twice saved my life and yet because on some occasions he has happened to act differently from what I have supposed he ought to have acted I have taken upon me to treat him with coldness that was affected with reproof when I owed him thanks and with rudeness such as I supposed became my sex  'For me he has risked his life again and again without hesitation while I have sat in timid silence and countenanced calumnies which it was impossible I could believe though I seem as if I had endeavoured to believe them from  the disgrace which I knew would justly light on me should these calumnies prove false False I could not but think them false they have proved and I am unworthy of him I have presumed upon the prejudices which I knew would protect me in the opinions of the foolish and gain me their applause and have treated him with a haughtiness which he ought to despise Has he deserved it Has he been guilty of one mean or seductive art that might induce me to betray a duty and gratify him at the expence of myself and others Has he entered into that base warfare of the sexes by which each in turn endeavours to deceive'  "The thought suddenly struck her and interrupting herself she hastily asked 'Where is the letter you mentioned I will read it I know I shall read my own condemnation but I will read it'  "I presented the letter and replied 'Mr Trevor instructed me to tell you  when I delivered it that it contains nothing which he wishes you to conceal should you think fit to shew it that it does not invite you to any improper correspondence and that it is the only one which under his present circumstances he means to obtrude upon you'  "Evidently overcome by the generous rectitude of your conduct and more dissatisfied with her own she broke the seal and began to read  "She hurried it once over with great eagerness and trepidation She then paused debating whether she should unburthen her mind immediately of a crowd of thoughts but finding they crossed and disturbed each other she began again and read aloud interrupting herself by remarks as she proceeded  'My reproof and anger'  'Yes yes I have taught him to treat me like a Sultana He punishes me justly without intending it  'You have supposed me dead'  "Here addressing herself to me she added 'It was his servant Philip who being hired by a gentleman that came to Scarborough brought us this false intelligence His story was that he saw Mr Trevor's distraction on the morning after he had lost his money at a gamingtable to which rashness as it should seem he was driven by despair that Mr Trevor ran into the fields in a fit of frenzy and threw himself into the Avon that he Philip who had followed as fast as he could hastened to the place but never saw him more and that consequently and beyond all doubt he was there drowned  'Philip according to his own account hurried into the water and used every means in his power to find the body but not being successful he returned to his master's lodgings took some trifles that had been given him and left Bath  by the morning coach for London having nobody in Bath to give him a character and being less likely there to meet with another place'  "I informed Miss Mowbray that this was part of it true and part false for that Philip had taken a tenpound note which more than paid him his wages and that the other things which he carried away had not been given him"  'Indeed' exclaimed Miss Mowbray 'I am exceedingly sorry to hear it for after his second master left Scarborough and he was hired by my aunt to wait on me he behaved with great diligence and honesty  'Yet this accounts in part for his running away which he did that very night after I suppose he had discovered it was Mr Trevor at Cranfordbridge and I have never seen or heard of him since  'I am persuaded he thought Mr Trevor dead for after I had heard  my brother's account of the battle I thought the time and the circumstances contradictory and repeatedly questioned Philip who persisted in declaring he saw Mr Trevor jump into the river and drown himself  'Philip's account was that he had himself been out on errands early in the morning at which time he supposed the battle must have been fought and though there were many contradictory circumstances the positiveness with which the two tales were told led me to believe that the chief incidents of both were true And as I say the flight of Philip from Cranfordbridge persuades me that he actually had believed Mr Trevor dead  'I am sorry the poor fellow has done this wrong thing and been frightened away for I never before heard a servant speak with so much warmth and affection of a master as he did of Mr Trevor'  "She then continued to read and  made many observations which expressed dissatisfaction with herself and were favourable to you till she came to where you inform her that you had begun to study the law"  'By this I find' said she 'the story I have just heard is false'  "I asked What story is that pray"  "She replied 'I was last night at the opera where I saw Mr Trevor with Lady Bray Having so lately met with him under circumstances so different and apparently disadvantageous you may imagine that the joy I felt and the hope I conceived were not trifling  'My aunt saw him likewise but as she was not so familiar with his person as to have no doubt she first watched and then questioned me though as she upbraidingly told me she needed only to have enquired of my looks  'I ought perhaps first to have informed you that I had thought it my duty to use  the utmost sincerity undeceive her and declare all that I knew of what had passed at Cranfordbridge  'I performed this task on that very night while her heart was alive to the danger she had escaped and when she expressed a lively regret that the person from whom she had received such signal aid had disappeared Except his silence in the coach she said every thing bespoke him to be a gentleman well bred well educated courageous and as active as he was bold  'When she was told that the gentleman of whom she had been speaking with so much warmth had a peculiar motive for being silent and that this gentleman was no other than Mr Trevor she was very much moved The recollection of the manner in which she had been treating his character and of the alacrity with which he had afterward saved her life was exceedingly strong  and far from unmixed with pain Before she was aware of herself she exclaimed This Mr Trevor is a very extraordinary young man  'Unfortunately for Mr Trevor our servant Philip had absconded and a train of suspicions immediately arose in her mind It might be a conspiracy among them a desperate and unprincipled contrivance to effect a desperate and unprincipled purpose  'In this supposition she confirmed herself by every possible surmise each and all resting upon the assumed league between Philip and Mr Trevor  'I vainly urged that the sudden disappearing of both entirely contradicted such a conjecture that Mr Trevor if he were capable of an action like this must be as wicked as he was mad and that I had every reason to believe him a man of the most generous and elevated principles As you may suppose these  arguments from me only subjected me to reproof sarcasm and even suspicion  'My aunt fortified herself in her opinion and behaved with a more jealous watchfulness than ever She even terrified me with the dread of that which I could not credit the possibility that what she affirmed might be true  'But that I might do every thing in my power to prove that one part of her surmises was false I determined cautiously to avoid for the present seeing or even hearing any thing concerning Mr Trevor And this was my inducement for writing the note which you received  'My mind however suffered a continual conflict I debated on the propriety of listening to the daily defamation of Mr Trevor when there were so many presumptive facts in his favour and not endeavouring to prove that it was false and I accused my conduct of apparent  hypocrisy of assuming a calm unconcern which my heart belied  'The sight of him at the Opera renewed my selfreproaches in full force and likewise fortunately awakened my aunt's curiosity  'Accordingly one of our morning visits today has been to a friend of Lady Bray's and there we learned that Mr Trevor had been introduced by Sir Barnard to his lady and their common friends as a young gentleman coming into parliament and supposed to be possessed of extraordinary talents  'This I find by his letter is untrue and there still appears to be some mystery which perhaps as you see him so often you may be able to unravel'  "I immediately requested her to look at the date of the letter by which she saw it had been written several weeks and afterward made her acquainted with all the particulars I knew concerning  your beginning and renouncing the study of the law and your new political plans most carefully remembering to give your noble minded friend Mr Evelyn his due share of what I had to relate  "Oh how did her eyes swim and her features glow while I stated what I had heard of his sentiments and proceedings Yes She has a heart a heart to match your own Mr Trevor  "She then read the remainder of the letter but with numerous interruptions all of them expressing her admiration of your conduct by criminating her own  "When she had ended she spoke to me nearly as follows  'I am now my dear friend determined on the conduct I mean to pursue Oh How it delights my heart that Mr Trevor accords with me in opinion and advises me to that open sincerity after which I have long been struggling and which I am at length resolved to adopt I  mean to inform my aunt of all that I know as well as of all that I intend I will tell her where I have been shew her this letter repeat every thing I have heard and add my fixed purpose not to admit the addresses of any man on earth till my family shall authorise those of Mr Trevor For that or for the time when I shall be unconditionally my own mistress however distant it may be I will wait  'Tell Mr Trevor that my heart is overwhelmed by the sense it feels of his generous and noble conduct that it exults in his manly forbearance which so cautiously guards my rectitude rather than his own gratification that I will obey his injunction and that we will have no clandestine correspondence but that our souls shall commune they shall daily sympathise and mutually excite us to that perseverance in fidelity and virtue  which will be their own reward and the consolation and joy of our lives  'If my aunt my brother or any of their acquaintance should again calumniate Mr Trevor I will forewarn them of my further determination to inform him and enquire into the facts But I hope they will neither be so unjust nor so ungenerous At least I think my aunt will not when she hears the truth knows my resolution and remembers Cranfordbridge  'Of misinterpretation from Mr Trevor I am in no fear Had he one sinister design he never could have imagined the conduct he has so nobly pursued But to suppose the possibility of such a thing in him would be a most unpardonable injustice The man who should teach me to distrust him as a lover could never inspire me with admiration and confidence as a husband But different  indeed has been the lesson I have learned from Mr Trevor  'Oh that Mr Evelyn What a godlike morality has he adopted How rational How full of benefit to others and of happiness to himself  'But Mr Trevor's friends are all of this uncommon stamp and I own that to look into futurity and to suppose myself excluded by prejudice and pride from the enjoyment of such society is perhaps the most painful idea that can afflict the mind I am almost afraid of owning even to you my kind and sympathising friend the torrent of emotions I feel at the thought of the pure pleasures I hope for hereafter from a life spent with a partner like Mr Trevor heightened by the intercourse of the generous benevolent and strongminded men who share his heart'  To detail all that farther passed between Olivia and Miss Wilmot with the  particulars which the latter related to me would but be to repeat sensations and incidents that are already familiar to the reader And with respect to my own feelings those he will doubtless have anticipated What could they be but rapture What could they inspire but resolution the power to endure and the will to persevere  CHAP IX  THE STUDY OF ORATORY REMARKS ON

affection yet if admiration be the basis of love as I am persuaded it is my love was certainly increased I now seemed to be setting forward on a journey of the length of which I was indeed wholly ignorant but the road was made plain and the end was inexpressible happiness I should therefore travel with unwearied alacrity  But that I might shorten this unmeasured length of way it was necessary I should be as active in pursuit as I was ardent in my passion and the stimulus was a strong one Oratory accordingly Olivia excepted became the object that seemed the dearest to my heart Demosthenes

the additional intercourse which I thus acquired  with man his motives actions and heart was a school of the highest order  I did not however entirely confine myself to the society of the dead the

people of fashion to whom I gained access  But as the tribe that bestow on themselves this titillating epithet have a light and versatile character as they abound in praises that are void of discrimination and promises that are unmeaning and affect at one moment the most winning urbanity and at the next the most supercilious arrogance though they gave me much pleasure they likewise gave me exquisite pain  The more I became acquainted with  them the more I was amazed that the man who had been talking to me in the evening on terms of the utmost apparent equality if I met him the next morning did not know me  Some of them would even gaze full in my face as if to enquire"Who are you sir" but in reality to insult me The looks of these most courteous and polished people seem to say "In the name of all that is highbred how does it happen that persons of fashion do not unite to stare every such impertinent upstart out of their company"  Of all the insolence that disturbs society and puts it in a state of internal warfare the insolence of fashion wounds and imbitters the most It instantly provokes the offended person to enquire 'What kind of being is it that takes upon him to brave insult and despise me Has he more strength more activity more understanding than myself' In  numerous instances he is imbecile in body more imbecile still in mind and contemptible in person Nay he is often little better than a driveller  He whom the  hauteur  of fashion has compelled to reason thus will soon be led to further and more serious inferences  Nothing can reconcile men so as to induce them to remain peaceable spectators of enjoyments beyond their attainment except that unaffected benevolence which shall continually actuate the heart to communicate all the happiness it has the power to bestow This only can so temper oppression as to render gradual and orderly reform practicable  But I am talking to the winds  This wavering between extreme civility and rudeness was conspicuous in the behaviour of the Bray family toward me Her Ladyship at one moment would overlook me I being present as if no such person had been in existence or as if he were  not half so worthy of attention as her lapdog for as a proof on the lapdog it was lavished yet at another I was  absolutely  the most charming man on earth I had  positively  the most refined taste good breeding and all that that she had ever known  With Sir Barnard I was sometimes an oracle To me his discourse was directed to my judgment his appeals were made and my opinions were decisive In other fits he would not condescend to notice me If I interfered with a sentence he would pursue the conversation as if an objection made by me were unworthy of an answer and perhaps if I asked him a question he would affect to be deaf and make no reply  These are arts which render the condition of a supposed inferior truly hateful and as they were severely felt they were severely remembered and now and then  retaliated in a spirit which I cannot applaud  If the history of such emotions were traced through all their consequences and if men were aware how much the principal events of their lives are the result of the petty ebullitions of passion that branch of morals which should regulate the temper of mind tone of voice and expression of the countenance would become a very serious study  This remark is as old as Adam and yet it relates to a science that is only in its infancy  How fatal the want of such a necessary command of temper had been to me the reader already knows and though at moments I was painfully conscious of the defect and it was become less obtrusive it was far from cured It still hovered over and influenced my fate as will be seen  The old parliament was not yet dissolved it had met and was sitting But the defection of Sir Barnard's member was of late date and as the Baronet had his motives for not wishing to provoke the honorable member whom he had made too violently there was a kind of compromise and the apostate was suffered to keep his seat during the short remainder of the term  Sir Barnard however as I have said delighted in his prop It was as necessary to him as his cane and I generally accompanied him when he visited any kind of political assemblies  It happened that there was an annual dinner of the gentlemen who had been educated at *** **** of which dinner Sir Barnard was appointed one of the stewards That he might acquit himself of this arduous task with eclat I was of course presented with a ticket and attended as his aid de camp  The company was numerous and the stewards and the chairman met something more early than the rest to regulate the important business of the day  When I entered the committee room with the Baronet the first person that caught my eye was the Earl of Idford  I shrunk back I had a momentary hesitation whether I should insult him or instantly quit the company and disdain to enter an apartment polluted by his presence  I had however just good sense enough to recollect that a quarrel in such a place nobody knew why would be equally ridiculous and rash and that to avoid any man was cowardly  The thought awakened me and collecting myself I advanced with a firm and cool air  Habit and perversity of system had done that for his lordship to which his fortitude was inadequate He was at  least as cool and as intrepid as myself and bowed to me with the utmost ease and civility To return his bow was infinitely more repulsive than taking a toad in my hand yet to forbear would have been a violation of the first principles of the behaviour of a gentleman I therefore reluctantly and formally complied I hope the reader remembers how earnestly I condemn this want of temper in myself  His lordship took not the least notice of the coldness of my manner but with simpering complacency "hoped I had been well since he had had the pleasure of seeing me"  My reply was another slight inclination of the head tinctured with disdain on which his lordship turned his back with a kind of openmouthed nonchalance that was truly epigrammatic and fell into conversation with Sir Barnard who had advanced toward the fire with  all the apparent ease of the most intimate friendship though since his lordship had changed sides they had become in politics at least the most outrageous enemies  This brought a train of reflections into my mind on the behaviour of political partisans toward each other and on the efforts they make after they have been venting the most cutting sarcasms in their mutual parliamentary attacks to behave out of doors as if they had totally forgotten what had passed within or were incapable if not of feeling of remembering insult  What is most remarkable the men of greatest talent exert this amenity with the greatest effect for they utter and receive the most biting reproaches yet meet each other as if no such bickerings had ever passed  It is not then in characters like these hypocrisy  No It is an effort to live in harmony with mankind yet to speak the truth and tell them of their mistakes unsparingly and regardless of personal danger In other words it is an attempt to perform the most sacred of duties but the manner of performing it effectually has hitherto been ill understood  Sir Barnard had witnessed the short scene between me and his lordship and presently took occasion to ask me in a whisper "how and where we had become acquainted"  I replied "I had resided in the house of his lordship"  "Ay indeed" said the Baronet In what capacity"  My pride was piqued and I answered "As his companion and as I was taught to suppose myself his friend But I was soon cured of my mistake"  "By what means"  By his lordship's patriotism By the purity of his politics"  I spoke with a sneer and the Baronet burst into a malicious laugh of triumph but unwilling that the cause of it should be suspected it was instantly restrained  "What concern had you" continued he "in his lordship's politics"  "I have reason to believe I helped to reconcile him to the Minister"  "You Mr Trevor How came you to do so unprincipled so profligate a thing"  "It was wholly unintentional"  "I do not understand you"  "I wrote certain letters that were printed in the"  "What Mr Trevor were you the author of the three last letters of Themistocles"  "I was"  The Baronet's face glowed with exultation  "I knew" said he with a vehement but under voice "he never wrote them himself I have said it a thousand times and I am not easily deceived Every body said the same"  There is no calculating how much the knowlege of this circumstance raised me in Sir Barnard's opinion and consequently elevated himself in the idea he conceived of his own power "Had he indeed got hold of the author of Themistocles Why then he was a great man A prodigious senator The wish of his heart was accomplished He could now wreak vengeance where he most wished it to fall and fall it should without mercy or remission" His little soul was on tiptoe and he overlooked the world  Though we had retired to the farthest corner of the room and his lordship pretended to be engaged in chit chat with persons who were proud of his  condescension I could perceive his suspicions were awakened His eye repeatedly gave enquiring glances and while it endeavoured to counterfeit indifference by a stare it was disturbed and contracted by apprehension  Malignity hatred and revenge are closely related and of these passions men of but little mental powers are very susceptible It is happy for society that their impotence impedes the execution of their desires I was odious in the sight of Lord Idford in every point of view for he had first injured me which as has been often remarked too frequently renders him who commits the injury implacable and he had since encountered a rival in me which was an insult that his vanity and pride could ill indeed digest  Still however he was a courtier a man of fashion a person of the best breeding and therefore could smile  A smile is a delightful thing when it is the genuine offspring of the heart but heaven defend me from the jaundiced eye the simpering lip and the wrinkled cheek that turn smiles to grimace and give the lie to open and undisguised pleasure  It was a smile such as this that his lordship bestowed upon me when I and the Baronet joined his group Addressing himself to me with a simper that anticipated the pain he intended to give he said"Do you know Mr Trevor that your friend the bishop of is to dine with us You will be glad to meet each other"  I instantly replied with fire in my eyes "I shall be as glad to meet that most pious and right reverend pastor as I was to meet your lordship"  Agreeably to rule he bowed and gave the company to understand he took this as a polite acknowledgment of respect But his gesture was accompanied with a  disconcerted leer of smothered malice which I could not misinterpret It was sardonic and to me who knew what was passing in his heart disgusting and painful  I had scarcely spoken before my lord the bishop entered and with him as two supportersHeavens WhoThe president of the college where I had been educated and the tutor whose veto had prevented me from taking my degrees  In the life of every man of enterprise there are moments of extreme peril In an instant and as it were by enchantment I saw myself surrounded by the cowardly servile dwarfdemons for so my imagination painted them who had been my chief tormentors Or rather by reptiles the most envenomed with which I was shut up as if I had been thrown into their den and by which if I did not exterminate them I must expect to be devoured  But these feelings were of short duration My heart found an immediate repellent both to fear and revenge in my eyes Good God What were the figures now before me Such as to excite pity in every bosom that was not shut to commiseration for the vices into which mankind are mistakenly hurried and for their deplorable consequences What a fearful alteration had a few months produced In the bishop especially  He had been struck by the palsy and dragged one side along with extreme difficulty His bloated cheeks and body had fallen into deep pits and the swelling massy parts were of a blackred hue so that the skin appeared a bag of morbid contents His mouth was drawn awry his speech entirely inarticulate his eye obscured by thick rheum and his clothes were stained by the saliva that occasionally driveled from his lips His legs were  wasted his breast was sunk and his protuberant paunch looked like the receptacle of dropsy atrophy catarrh and every imaginable malady  My heart sunk within me Poor creature What would I have given to have possessed the power of restoring thee to something human Resentment to thee Alas Had I not felt compassion such as never can be forgotten I surely should have despised should have almost hated myself  The president was evidently travelling the same road His legs which had been extremely muscular instead of being as round and smooth in their surface as they formerly were each appeared to be covered with innumerable nodes that formed irregular figures and angles What they were swathed with I cannot imagine but I conjecture there must have been stiff brown paper next to the smooth silk stocking which produced the  irregularities of the surface The dullness of his eyes the slowness of their motions his drooping eyelids his flaccid cheeks his hanging chin and the bagging of his cloaths all denoted waste want of animation lethargy debility and decline  The condition of the tutor was no less pitiable He was gasping with an asthma and was obliged incessantly to struggle with suffocation It was what physicians call a confirmed case while he lived he was doomed to live in pain Where is the tyrant that can invent tortures equal to those which men invent for themselves  These were the guests who were come to feast to indulge appetites they had never been able to subdue though their appetites were vipers that were eating away their vitals  How strongly did this scene bring to my recollection Pope on the ruling passion  I could almost fancy I heard the poor bishop quoting  Mercy cries Helluo mercy on my soul  Is there no hopeAlasThen bring the jowl  The present man is but the slave of the past What induced the president and the tutor when the bishop's more ablebodied footmen had rather carried than conducted him up stairs officially to become his supporters as he entered the room Was it unmixed humanity Or was it those servile habits to which their cunning had subjected them and by which they supposed not only that preferment but that happiness was attainable  Humanity doubtless had its share for it is a sensation that never utterly abandons the breast of man and as it is often strengthened by a consciousness that we ourselves are in need of aid let  us suppose that the president and the tutor were become humane  Though feelings of acrimony towards these persons were entirely deadened in me by the spectacle I beheld yet I knew not well how to behave I was prompted to shew them how placable I was become by accosting them first but this might be misconstrued into that servility for which I had thought of them with so much contempt Beside the bishop and the president if not the tutor were in the phraseology of the world my superiors and etiquette had established the rule that if they thought proper to notice me they would be the first to salute  His lordship however eased me of farther trouble on this head by asking the bishop"Have you forgotten your old acquaintance Mr Trevor my lord"  What answer this consecrated right reverend father returned I could not hear He muttered something but the sounds  were as unintelligible as the features of his face or the drooping deadness of his eyes The president however hearing this thought proper to bow though very slightly till the earl added with a significant emphasis on the two last words "Sir Barnard is become Mr Trevor's particular friend" which was no sooner pronounced than the countenances of both the bishop's supporters changed to something which might be called exceedingly civil in the tutor and prodigiously condescending in the president  This was a memorable day and if the event which I have now to relate should be offensive to the feelings of any man or any class of men I can only say that I share the common fate of historians who though they should relate nothing but facts never fail to excite displeasure if not resentment and persecution in the partisans of this or that particular opinion faction or establishment  The dinner was served It was sumptuous or rather such as gluttony delights in The persons assembled I am sorry to say it were several of them gluttons and encouraged and countenanced each other in the vice to which they were addicted  Dish succeeded to dish and one plateful was but devoured that another and another might be gorged  Fatal insensibility to the warning voice of experience Incomprehensible blindness  The poor bishop was unable to resist his destiny  I had a foreboding of the mischief that might result from a stomach at once so debilitated and so overloaded I wished to have spoken I was tempted to exclaim"Rash man beware" I could not keep my eyes away from him till at length I suddenly remarked a strange appearance that came over his face and  almost at the same instant he dropped from his chair in an apoplectic fit  The description of his foaming mouth distorted features dead eyes the whites of which only were to be seen his writhings his  No I must forbear The picture I witnessed could give nothing but pain mingled with disgust and horror If I suggest that poor oppressed nature made the most violent struggles to empty and relieve herself there will perhaps be more than sufficient of the scene of which I was a spectator conjured up in the imagination  The bishop had been a muscular man with a frame of uncommon strength and the paroxysm though extreme did not end in death Medical assistance was obtained and he was borne away as soon as the crisis was over but the festivity for which the company had met was disturbed Many of them were struck  with terror dreading left they had only been present at horrors that soon or late were to light upon themselves They departed appalled by the scene they had witnessed and haunted by images of a foreboding black and distracted kind  From these Sir Barnard himself was not wholly free though he had been less guilty of gormandizing than many of his associates and for my own part this incident left an impression upon me which I am persuaded will be salutary through life  CHAP X  A FEW REFLECTIONS A WORD CONCERNING FRIENDS AND THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP NEWS OF THORNBY OR THE EQUITY OF THE DYING THE DECEASE OF MY MOTHER A CURIOUS LETTER ON THE OBSEQUIES OF THE DEAD THE REAL AND THE IDEAL BEING UNLIKE TO EACH OTHER  HOW different is the same man at different periods of his existence How  very unlike were the bowing well bred Earl of Idford and the asthmatic tutor of this day to the Lord Saddog and his Jack whom but a few years before I first met at college  The president too at that time was quite as much in form as in office one of the pillars of the university And the bishop What a lamentable change had a short period produced  Happy would it be for men did they recollect that change they must and that if they will but be sufficiently attentive to circumstances they may change for the better  Time kept rolling on and I had variety of occupation Neither my studies my fashionable acquaintances nor those whom I justly loved as my friends were neglected Mr Evelyn continued for some time in town attending to his anatomical and chymical studies Wilmot had completed his comedy It had been  favourably received by the manager and was to be the second new piece brought forward Turl with equal perseverance was pursuing his own plans and though I heard nothing more from Olivia my heart was at ease I knew the motives on which she acted and had her assurance that if I should be again defamed I should now be heard in my own defence  I was careful not to forget honest Clarke nor was the kindhearted Mary neglected The good carpenter had sent for his wife and family up to town and Mary was happy in the friendly attentions of Miss Wilmot and in the orderly conduct and quick improvement of her son  One of my pleasures and duties as I conceived it to be was to introduce Turl and Wilmot to such of my higher order of acquaintance as might afford both parties gratification There is much frivolity among people of rank and fashion  but there is likewise some enquiry and sound understanding and where these qualities exist in any eminent degree the friends I have named could not but be welcome  It is the interest of men of  orders to converse with each other to listen to their mutual pretensions with patience to be slow to condemn and to be liberal in the construction of what they at first suppose to be dangerous novelty  Turl was peculiarly fitted to promote these principles and Wilmot in addition to the charms of an imagination finely stored was possessed as the reader may remember of musical talents and those of no inferior order Days and weeks passed not unpleasantly away for hope and Olivia were ever present to my imagination and of the ills which fortune had in reserve I was little aware  While business and pleasure thus appeared to promote each other it came to  my knowledge that an advertisement had appeared in the papers stating that if Hugh Trevor the grandson of the reverend **** rector of *** were alive by application at a place there named he might hear of something very much to his advantage  I cannot enumerate the conjectures that this intelligence immediately excited for they were endless I searched the papers found the advertisement and hastened to the place to which it directed me  The information I there received was not precisely what my elevated hopes had taught me to expect but it was of considerable moment I learned that my grandfather's executor Mr Thornby was dead that his nephew Wakefield had taken possession of the property he had left but that he had done this illegally for the person who caused the advertisement to be put into the paper was  an attorney who had drawn and witnessed the will of Thornby which will was in my favour and which moreover stated that the property bequeathed to me was mine in right of a will of my grandfather's which will Thornby had till that time kept concealed Whether the testament he had produced immediately after the death of the rector were one that Thornby had forged or one that my grandfather had actually made but had ordered his executor to destroy did not at present appear The account I gave of it in a preceding volume and of the manner in which it was procured was the substance of what I learned from the conversation of my mother and Thornby at the time  A deathbed compunction had wrested from the deceased an avowal of his guilt and the facts were explicitly stated in the preamble of his will in order to prevent the contest which he foresaw might probably  take place between me and his nephew He seemed to have been painfully anxious to do justice at last and save his soul when he found it must take flight  The business was urgent and if I meant to profit by that which was legally mine it was necessary as I was advised immediately to go down and examine into all the circumstances on the spot  I was the more surprised at what I had heard because it was but very lately that I had sent a remittance to my mother which she had acknowledged and which must have been received after her husband had taken possession of his uncle's effects But when I recollected the character that had been given me of Wakefield as far as the transaction related to him my surprise was of short duration  With respect to my mother I heard with no small degree of astonishment that she had been applied to in order to discover  where I might be found and that she had returned evasive answers which as it was supposed had been dictated by her husband under whose control partly from fear and partly from an old woman's doating she was completely held  To say that I grieved at such weakness in one whom I had so earnestly desired to love and honor with more than filial affection would be superfluous but my surprise would have instantly ceased had I known who this Wakefield was with whom my mother had to contend  Reproach from me however in word or look had I been so inclined she was destined never to receive The career of pain and pleasure with her was nearly over On the same day that I made the enquiries I have been repeating a letter arrived written not by her but at her request which informed me that if I meant to see her alive I must use all possible speed for that she had been suddenly  seized with dangerous and intolerable pains which according to the description given in the letter were such as I found from enquiry belong to the iliac passion and that she was then lying at the last extremity  Two such imperious mandates requiring my presence in my native county were not to be disobeyed and I departed with the utmost diligence At the last stage after a journey of unremitted expedition I ordered the chaise to drive to the house of the late Thornby where on enquiry I was informed that my mother lay  I found her in a truly pitiable condition Quicksilver had been administered but in vain and she was so thoroughly exhausted that the sight of me produced but very little emotion Her medical attendant pronounced she could not survive fourandtwenty hours and advised that if there were any business to be settled  between us it should be proceeded upon immediately  Had this advice been given to persons of certain habits assuredly it would not have been neglected and perhaps it ought not to have been by me but whether I was right or wrong I could not endure to perplex and disturb the mind of a mother in her last agonies The consequence was she expired without hearing a word from me concerning her husband Thornby or the property to which I was heir and without making any mention whatever herself of the disposal of this property  I was indeed ignorant of what degree of information she could afford me Her conduct had been so weak that to remind her of it at such a moment would as I supposed have been to inflict a severe degree of torment  This as the reader will learn in time was not the only shaft by which my tranquillity  was to be assaulted My mother though she was there was yet another death infinitely more heartrending hanging over my head The recollection is anguish that cannot end Cannot did I say Absurd mortal Live for the living and grieve not for the dead unless grief could bid them rise from their graves  I must proceed and not suffer my feelings thus to anticipate my tale  Knowing that Wakefield was no other than Belmont the reader will not be surprised that he should think proper to elude under these circumstances the discovery which a meeting must have produced My mother actuated by a conviction that death was inevitable had sent for me without his privity so that I afterward learned he was in the house when I drove up to the door and seeing me put my head out of the chaise immediately made his escape through the garden  A man less fertile in expedients would have found it difficult to forge a plausible pretext to evade being present and meeting me at the funeral but he by pursuing what wore the face of being and what I believe actually was very rational conduct dexterously shunned the rencontre The following letter which he wrote to me will explain by what means  "Sir  "Persons of understanding have discovered that the obsequies of the dead may be performed with all due decorum and the pain as well as the very frequent hypocrisy of a funeral procession which is attended by friends and relations avoided They therefore with great good sense hire people to mourn or send their empty carriages with the blinds up which perhaps is quite as wise and no doubt as agreeable to the dead  "He that would not render the duties  of humanity while they can succour those that are afflicted may justly be called brutal but those duties being paid what remains is more properly the business of carpenters gravediggers and undertakers than of men whose happiness is disturbed by useless but gloomy associations and who may find better employment for their time  "I for example have business at present that calls me another way I therefore request you will give such orders concerning the funeral as you shall think proper and as I have no doubt you will agree with me that decency and not unnecessary pomp which cannot honor the dead and does but satirise the living will be most creditable to Mrs Wakefield's memory the expence as it ought will be defrayed by me  "I am sir "Your very obedient humble servant "F WAKEFIELD"  Had such a letter been written by a man who had pretended fondness for his wife it might perhaps have been construed unfeeling if not insulting to her memory But as the case was notoriously the reverse the honest contempt of all affectation which it displayed I could not but consider as an unexpected trait in the character of such a man as I supposed Wakefield to be  There is a strange propensity in the imagination to make up ideal beings and annex them to names that when mentioned have been usually followed with certain degrees of praise or blame These fanciful portraits are generally in the extreme they are all virtue or all vice all perfection or all deformity though it is well known that no such unmixed mortals exist  My mind having acquired the habit rather to doubt than to conclude that every thing which is customary must be  right funeral follies had not escaped my censure but the thing which excited my surprise was that a man like Wakefield who I concluded must have thought very little indeed since he both thought and acted on other occasions so differently from me should in any instance reason like myself and some few others whom I most admired  Convinced however as I was that he now reasoned rightly I wanted in this case the courage to act after his example It would be a scandal to the country for a son pretending to filial duty to be absent from his mother's funeral The reader will doubtless remember that town and country are two exceedingly distinct regions  CHAP XI  MORE ALARMING INTELLIGENCE AN HONEST YOUTH WITH A PRINTER'S NOTIONS CONCERNING SECRECY THE WEAK PARTS OF LAW FORM THE STRONGEST SHIELD FOR VILLANY A JOURNEY BACK TO TOWN ENOCH ELLIS AND GLIBLY AGAIN APPEAR ON THE SCENE OF ACTION A FEW OF THE ARTIFICES OF A MAN OF UNCOMMON CUNNING DELINEATED A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT A MOUNTAIN OF POLITICAL RUBBISH BY ARTFUL DEDUCTIONS A MAN MAY BE MADE TO SAY ANY THING THAT AN ORATOR PLEASES  THIS scandal I was notwithstanding my discretion destined to afford In addition to the arguments of Wakefield accident supplied a motive too powerful to be resisted  I have mentioned my intention to suppress the pamphlet which I had written in the fever of my resentment against the Earl the Bishop and their associates  The edition which had been printed for publishing had lain in the printer's warehouse till the time that I had determined against its appearance  The child of the fancy is often as dear to us as any of our children whatever and I was unwilling that this offspring of mine should perish beyond all power of revival I therefore had the edition removed to my lodgings and stowed in a garret  A copy however had been purloined and probably before the removal This copy came into the possession of an unprincipled bookseller who regardless of every consideration except profit and perceiving it to be written with vehemence on a subject which never fails to attract the attention of the public namely personal defamation had once more committed it to the press  As it happened it was sent to be reprinted by the person with whom the son  of Mary was bound apprentice and the whole was worked off except the titlepage which fell into the hands of the youth  Desirous of shewing kindness to Mary it may well be supposed I had not overlooked her son His mother had taught him to consider me as the saviour of both their lives and as such he held me in great veneration These favourable feelings were increased by the praise I bestowed on him for his good conduct and the encouragement I gave him to persevere  Richard for that was his name suspected it could be no intention of mine to publish the pamphlet because he had been employed to stow it in the garret and as he was an intelligent lad and acquainted with the tricks of the publisher for whom he knew his master was at work he hastened in great alarm to communicate his fears first to his mother  and then by her advice to Miss Wilmot  The latter immediately informed her brother He saw the danger wrote to me to return without delay doubting whether even I should have the power to prevent the publication and proceeded himself immediately to the printer to warn him of the nature of the transaction  The man was no sooner informed of Mr Wilmot's business than he became violently enraged with his apprentice Richard accused him of betraying his master's interest and the secrets of the printinghouse which ought to be held sacred and affirmed that he had endangered the loss of his business  Richard was present was aware of the charge which would be brought against him and was prepared to endure it with considerable firmness though he had been taught to believe that such complaints were founded in justice  Wilmot could obtain no unequivocal answer from the master either that he would or would not proceed He consequently supposed the affirmative was the most probable and therefore that he might neglect nothing in an affair which he considered as so serious he hastened from the printer to the publisher  Here in addition to the rage of what he likewise called having been betrayed he met with open defiance vulgar insolence and vociferous assertions from this worthy bookseller that the laws of his country would be his shield  The fellow had been frequently concerned in such rascalities and knew his ground He was one of the sagacious persons who had found a cover for them Where law pretends to regulate and define every right the wrong which it cannot reach it protects  This is a branch of knowledge on which a vast body of men in the kingdom  and especially in the metropolis depend for their subsistence And a very tempting trade it is for our streets our public places and our courts of justice as well as other courts swarm with its followers at which places they appear in as high a style of fashion that is of effrontery as even the fools by whom they are aped or the lawyers and statesmen themselves by whom they are defended This I own is a bold assertion and is perhaps a hyperbole Yes yes it is comparing mole hills to mountains But let it pass  Wilmot in his letter to me did not confine himself to a bare recital of facts Fearful left they should escape my recollection he urged those strong arguments which were best calculated to shew not only what my enemies might allege but what just men might impute to me should this intemperate pamphlet appear which in addition to  its original mistakes would attack the character of the Bishop a man whose office in the eye of the world implied every virtue And how immoderately would its intemperance and imputed malignity be exaggerated should it appear precisely at the moment when I knew disease had deprived him of his faculties had rendered him unable to defend himself and to produce facts which I might have concealed or give another face to truth which I might have discoloured  These arguments alarmed me in a very painful degree I was averse to quit the place before my mother was interred especially as my reasons for such an abrupt departure could not be made public but I was still more averse to an action which in appearance would involve me in such a cowardly species of infamy  Accordingly I made the best arrangements in my power leaving orders that  the funeral should be conducted with every decency and after a very short conversation with the attorney who had witnessed the will of Thornby and given me the information I have already mentioned I travelled back to London with no less speed than I had hurried into the country  I arrived in town on Thursday night and the pamphlet was advertised for publication on the following Monday The advertisement being purposely written to excite curiosity repeated the subject of the pamphlet which asserted my claims to the letters of Themistocles and to the defence of the thirtynine articles the acrimony of which charge was increased by a personal attack on the Earl of Idford the Bishop and their associates  When I came to my lodgings I found two notes one from a person stiling himself a gentleman employed by the  Earl and another from Mr Ellis on the part of the Bishop each requesting an interview Answers not having been returned these agents had come themselves and being informed that I was in the country but was expected in town before the end of the week they left a pressing message desiring an answer the moment of my arrival  Eager as I was to ward off the danger that threatened me I considered the application that was made especially on the part of the Earl as fortunate I understood that the only means of suppressing the pamphlet would be by an injunction from the Lord Chancellor and this I imagined the influence of the Earl might essentially promote for which reason I immediately wrote in reply to these agents and appointed an interview early the next morning  The place of meeting was a private room in a coffeehouse and though  my eagerness in the business brought me there a few minutes before the time named Ellis and his coadjutor had arrived before me They acted in concert and had met to compare notes  I found the purveyor of pews and paradise still the same always inclined to make himself agreeable  The other agent was seated in a dark corner of the room with his back to the light so that I did not recognise him as I entered How much was I surprised when as he turned to the window I discovered him to be the loquacious Mr Glibly the man whose principles were so accommodating whose tongue was glossy but whose praise was much more sickening and dangerous than his satire  The civilities that were poured upon me by these wellpaired gentlemen were overwhelming It was like taking leave of a Frenchman under the ancient  régime  there was no niche or chink for me to  throw in a word so copious was the volubility of Glibly and so eager was the zeal of Ellis  From the picture I before gave of the first the reader will have perceived that he was a man of considerable intellect though not of sufficient to make him honest His usual mode in conversation was to render the person to whom he addressed himself ridiculous by excessive praise and to mingle up sarcasm and panegyric in such a manner as to produce confusion in the mind of the object of it who never knew when to be angry or when to be pleased and laughter in every body else  At first the most witty and acute would find amusement in his florid irony but they could not but soon be wearied by its methodical and undeviating mechanism which denoted great barrenness of invention  In the present instance he had a case  that required management a patron to oblige and an opponent to circumvent He had therefore the art to assume a tone as much divested of sneering as habit would permit and began by insinuations that were too flattering to fail of their effect yet not quite gross enough to offend My person my appearance my parliamentary prospects my understanding my friends and connections all passed in review while his praise was carefully tempered and as I imagined very passably appropriate  Hence it certainly promoted the end for which it was given it opened my heart and prepared me for that generous effusion which rather inclines to criminate itself than to insist on every trifle that may be urged in its favour  Apt however as he was at detecting vanity in others he was as open to it himself I might almost say as any man on earth He began with a profession  of his friendship for the Earl of Idford in which he assumed the tone of having conferred a favour on that noble lord and I will not deny that he was right All his acquaintance were friends and perhaps he had the longest list of any man in London for the effrontery of his familiar claims upon every man he met from whom he had any thing to hope or fear was so extraordinary as to render an escape from him impossible He had parroted the phraseology of the  haut ton  and its arrogant apathy till the manner was so habitual to him that he was unconscious of his own impudence  Thus in conversing on this occasion of the Earl who had deputed him the only appellation he had for his patron was Idford "I told Idford what I thought on the subject For I always speak the truth and never deceive people unless it be to give them pleasure and then you know they are the more  obliged to me Glibly said Idford to me I know you will act in this business without partiality For I must do him justice Trevor and assure you that Idford is a good fellow I do not pretend that he is not sensible of the privileges which rank and fashion give him He is vain thinks himself a great orator a fine writer a wise senator and all that I grant it How should it be otherwise It is very natural He would have been a devilish sensible fellow if he had not been a lord But that is not to be helped You and I in his place should think and act the same We should be as much deceived as silly and as ridiculous It is all right Things must be so But Idford is a very good fellow He is upon my honor"  The surgeon that has a difficult case will not only make preparations and adjustments before he begins to probe lacerate or cauterize but will sometimes  administer an opiate to stupefy that sensibility which he apprehends is too keen Glibly pursued much the same method and having exhausted nearly all his art till he found he had produced as great a propensity to compliance and conciliation as be could reasonably hope he proceeded to the business in question  "You no doubt guess my dear Trevor why my friend Ellis here and I desired to meet you"  "I do"  "To say the truth knowing as I do the soundness of your understanding the quickness of your conception and the consequences that must follow which acute as you are you could not but foresee I was amazed when I read your advertisement"  "It is prodigiously surprising indeed" added Ellis eager at every opportunity to throw in such touches as he thought  would give effect to the colouring of his friend and leader  "Why" said I "do you call it my advertisement"  "I mean of a pamphlet which it seems has been written by you"  "But is going to be published without my consent"  "Are you serious" said Glibly staring  "It is not my custom to deceive people Mr Glibly  not even to give them pleasure"  "I am prodigious glad of that" exclaimed the holy Enoch "Prodigious glad indeed"  "But you have owned it was written by you" continued Glibly  "I know no good that can result from disowning the truth and especially in the present instance"  "My dear fellow truth is a very pretty thing on some occasions but to be continually  telling truth as you call it oh Lord oh Lord we should set the whole world to cutting of throats"  "To be sure we should" cried Ellis  "To be sure we should That is my morality exactly"  "Men are men my dear fellow A lord is a lord a bishop is a bishop Each in his station Things could not go on if we did not make allowances To tell truth would be to overturn all order"  "I am willing to make allowances for all men are liable to be mistaken"  "I approve that sentiment very much Mr Trevor" interrupted Enoch "It is prodigious fine It is my own All men are liable to be mistaken I have said it a thousand times It is prodigious fine"  "But I cannot conceive" added I "that to overturn systems which are founded in vice and folly would be to overturn all order You may call systematic selfishness systematic hypocrisy  and systematic oppression order but I assert they are disorder"  "My dear fellow nothing is so easy as to assert But we will leave this to another time I dare say that in the main there is no great difference between us You wish for all the good things you can get and so do I One of us may take a more round about way to obtain them than the other but we both intend to travel to the same goal I own when I heard of your  brouillerie  with my friend Idford I thought you had missed the road But I find you have more wit than I supposed you are now guided by another fingerpost Perhaps it might have been as well not to have changed The treasury bench is a strong hold and never was so well fortified It is become impregnable It includes the whole power of England Scotland and Ireland both the Indies countless islands and boundless continents with all the  grand outworks of lords spiritual and temporal governors generals admirals custos rotulorum and magistracy bodies corporate and chartered companies excise and taxation board and bankruptcy commissioners contractors agents jobbers moneylenders and spies with all the gradations of these and many more distinct classes understrappers innumerable an endless swarm a monstrous mass Can it be conjured away by angry breath No no It is no house of cards for an individual to attempt to puff it down would be ridiculous insanity"  A mass indeed "Making Ossa like a wart" Yet the rubbish must be removed and it is mine and every man's duty to handle the spade and besom But men want to work miracles and because the mountain does not vanish at a word they rashly conclude it cannot be diminished They are mistaken Political  error is a pestilential cloud dense with mephitic and deadly vapours but a wind has arisen in the south that will drive it over states kingdoms and empires till at last it shall be swept from the face of the earth"  "My dear fellow you have an admirable genius but you have mistaken its bent Depend upon it you are no politician though you are a very great poet Fine phrases grand metaphors beautiful images all very admirable and you have them at command You are born to be an ornament to your country You have a very pretty turn Very pretty indeed And so which is the point that I was coming to concerning this pamphlet It relates I think to certain letters that appeared signed Themistocles"  "And to a defence by my lord the bishop of the thirty nine articles" added  Ellis "eager that he and his patron should not be omitted"  "You my dear fellow had some part in both of these publications"  "I do not know what you mean by some part The substance of them both was my own"  "Ay ay you had a share a considerable share You and Idford were friends You conversed together and communicated your thoughts to each other Did not you"  "I grant we did"  "I knew you would grant whatever was true You are the advocate of truth and I commend you Idford mixed with political men knew the temper of the times was acquainted with various anecdotes and gave you every information in his power I know you are too candid to conceal or disguise the least fact You would be as ready to condemn  yourself as another You have real dignity of mind It gives you a certain superiority a kind of grandeur of real grandeur It is your principle"  "It ought to be"  "No doubt And I am sure you will own that I have stated the case fairly I told you Mr Ellis that I knew my friend Trevor He has too much integrity to disown any thing I have said I dare believe were he to read the letters of Themistocles over at this instant he would find it difficult to affirm of any one sentence that the thought  might not possibly  have been suggested in conversation by my friend Idford I say  might not possibly  for you both perceive I am very desirous on this occasion to be guarded"  "It certainly is a difficult thing" answered I "for any man positively to affirm he can trace the origin of any one  thought and recollect the moment when it first entered his mind"  My lips were opening to proceed but Glibly with great eagerness prevented me  "I knew my dear fellow that your candor was equal to your understanding Mr Ellis who hears all that passes will do me the justice to say that I declared before you came what turn the affair would take"  I was again going to speak but he was determined I should not and proceeded with his unconquerable volubility purposely leading my mind to another train of thought  "I am very glad indeed that the advertisement which appeared was not with your approbation On recollection I cannot conceive how I could for a moment suppose it was your own act A man of the soundest understanding may  be surprised into passion and may write in a passion but he will think again and again and will be careful not to publish in a passion And the delay which has taken place might have proved to me that you had thought and had determined not to publish Your countenance when you disowned the advertisement just now convinces me that I do you no more than justice by supposing this of you"  Here the artful orator thought proper to pause for a reply and I answered "I own that I wrote in a spirit which I do not at present quite approve"  "I know it What you have said and what you have allowed have so much of liberality cool recollection and dispassionate honesty that they are as I knew they would be very honorable to you"  "Prodigiously indeed" said Enoch  Glibly continued "Your behaviour in this business entirely confirms my  good opinion of you and I give myself some credit for understanding a man's true character especially the character of a man like you My good friend Ellis and I are entirely satisfied What has passed has removed all doubts and difficulties We are with you and shall report every thing to your advantage"  "I wish you to report nothing but the truth"  "I know it my dear fellow That is what we intend So without saying a word more on that subject we will now consider what is best to be done I understand that the edition about to be published is pirated and I suppose you will join us in an application to the Lord Chancellor for an injunction"  "Most eagerly That was my reason for wishing to see you so immediately after my arrival in town imagining that an application from Lord Idford and the bishop would be more readily attended  to than if it came from a private and unknown individual"  "To be sure it would Mr Trevor" said Enoch "An application from an earl and a bishop is not likely to be overlooked They are privileged persons They are the higher powers Every thing that concerns them must be treated with tenderness and reverence and humbleness and every thing of that kind"  The spirit moved me to begin an enquiry into privileges and the tenderness and humility due to earls and bishops particularly to such as the noble and reverend lords in question but Glibly guessed my thoughts and took care to prevent me  "As to those subjects my dear Ellis" said he "Trevor thinks and acts on a different system from you and me and the rest of the world We must not dispute these points now but away as fast  as we can and put the business for which we met in a train The publication must be stopped It would injure all parties and as you my dear friend Turning to me justly think at present would be disgraceful to its author"  After what had been urged by Turl and Wilmot and the reasoning that had followed in my own mind I knew not how to deny this assertion though it was painfully grating But the reader will easily perceive that this and other strong affirmations such as I have related were designedly made by Glibly He artfully gabbled on that he might lead my mind from attending to them too strictly and that he might afterward if occasion should require state them with the colouring that he should give as things uttered or allowed by me"  It ought not to be thought strange that I was deceived by Glibly barefaced as his cunning would have appeared to a man  more versed in the arts which overreaching selfishness daily puts in practice He confessedly came in behalf of a party concerned and as such a liberal mind would be prepared to expect a bias from him rather in favour of his client His face was smiling his tones were soft and smooth the words candor honesty and integrity were continually on his tongue He affected to be a disinterested arbitrator and allowed that his friend Idford as he called him might or rather must be tainted with the vices of his station and class Could a youth unhacknied in the world feeling that treachery was not native to the heart of man not suspecting on ordinary occasions that it could exist could such a tyro in hypocrisy be a fit antagonist for such an adept  Deceit will frequently escape immediate detection but it seldom leaves the person upon whom it is practised with that clearness of thought which communicates calm to the mind producing  unruffled satisfaction and cheerful good temper  CHAP XII  A LAWYER AND HIS POETICAL WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OR THE FAMILY OF THE QUISQUES PRAISE MAY GIVE PAIN A BABBLER MAY BITE MORE OF THE COLOURING OF CUNNING A TRADER'S IDEAS OF HONESTY AND THE SMALL SUM FOR WHICH IT MAY BE SOLD  WE quitted the coffeehouse Glibly in high spirits and Enoch concluding things had been done as they should be but for my own part I experienced a confusion of intellect that did not suffer me to be so much at my ease I had an indistinct sense of being as passive as a blind man with his dog Instead of taking the lead as I was entitled to have done I was led hurried away like a man down a mountain with a high wind at his back or traversing dark alleys holding by the coatflap of a guide of  whose good intentions I was very far from having any certainty  We proceeded however to the house of a solicitor in chancery who transacted business for the Earl  Here Glibly attentive to the plan he had pursued began by informing Mr Quisque the lawyer that he had come  at the request  of his dear friend Trevor to entreat his aid in an affair of some moment "Mr Trevor is a young gentleman my dear Quisque that you will be proud to be acquainted with a man of talents a poet an orator an author a great genius an excellent scholar a fine writer turns a sentence or a rhyme with exquisite neatness very prettily I assure you I mention these circumstances my dear Quisque because I know you have a taste for such things and so has Mrs Quisque and the two Miss Quisques and all the family I now and then see very pretty things of their writing in the Lady's Magazine An  elegy on a robin redbreast The drooping violet a sonnet And others equally ecstatic Quite charming rapturous elegant flowery sentimental Some of them very smart and epigrammatic It is a family my dear Trevor that you must become intimate with Your merit entitles you to the distinction You will communicate your mutual productions You will polish and suggest charming little delicate emendations to each other before you favour the world with a sight of them"  The broadest and coarsest satire was never half so insulting to the feelings as the commonplace praise of Glibly  The barrenpated Ellis caught one of the favourite diminutives of Glibly and finished my panegyric by adding that "he must say his friend Mr Trevor was a prodigious pretty genius"  Who but must have been proud of such an introduction to the family of the Quisques by such orators such eulogists and such friends  Acquainted with Glibly and accustomed to hear him prate Mr Quisque seemed to listen to him without surprise pleasure or pain It was what he expected It was the man A machine that had no more meaning than a Dutch clock repeating cuckoo as it strikes  Among Glibly's acquaintance or as he called them his dear friends this was a common but a very false conclusion He had not adopted his customary cant without a motive The man who can persuade others that he gabbles in a pleasant but ridiculous and undesigning manner will lead them to suppose that his actions are equally incongruous and void of intention He will pass upon the world for an agreeable harmless fellow till his malignities are too numerous to escape notice and then where he was before welcomed with the hope of a laugh he will continue to be admitted from the dread of a bite  A lawyer however feels less of this panic than the rest of mankind because he can bite again The cat o' mountain will not attack the tiger  Glibly returned to the business in hand and again repeated that he was come  at the request  of his dear friend Trevor to procure an injunction that should prevent the publication of a pamphlet which had been written against his friend Idford"  "And my lord the Bishop * * * *" added Enoch  "Who is the author of it" demanded Quisque  "I am sir" answered I  "For which my friend Trevor is very sorry" added Glibly  I instantly retorted a denial "I never said any thing of the kind Mr Glibly But I should be very sorry indeed if it were published"  "Nay my dear fellow according to your own principles if I do not mistake  them that which ought not to be published ought not to be written"  The remark was acute it puzzled me and I was silent He proceeded  "It is a business that admits of no delay I should be extremely chagrined extremely upon my honor that my dear friend Trevor should commit himself to the public in this affair He that wantonly attacks the characters of others does but strike at his own"  I again eagerly replied "The attack from me sir was not wanton It was provoked acts of the most flagrant injustice"  Glibly as eagerly interrupted me  "My dear fellow why are you so warm I was only delivering a general maxim I made no application of it and I am surprised that you should"  The traps of Glibly were numberless and not to be escaped Words are too equivocal and phrases too indefinite for men like him not to profit by their ambiguity To them a quirk in the sense is  as profitable as a pun or a quibble in the sound They snap at them as dogs do at flies It is no less worthy of observation that though some of his actions seemed to laugh severity of moral principle out of countenance he continually repeated others which had his conduct been regulated by them would have ranked him among the most worthy of mankind  After farther explanation from Quisque it was admitted that the interest of all parties made it necessary for him to act with great diligence speed and caution  Through the whole of this scene Glibly was consistent with himself in giving it such a turn and complexion as to make it requisite for the preservation of my character above the rest to prevent the pamphlet from being published If whenever I detected his drift I urged the true motives by which I was actuated he always immediately admitted them praised them and allowed them to be superlatively excellent but never failed to give  them such an air as should suit the project he had conceived and allow of such an interpretation in future as would exculpate my opponents and criminate myself But he effected this with such fluency and so glossed over and coloured his intention that like profound darkness it was every where present but neither could be felt nor seen  My own activity in this affair which if I meant to render my interference effectual was inevitable contributed to the same end I accompanied the whole party Quisque being one to the shop of the publisher  Here I detailed the consequences as well to myself as to the Earl and the Bishop and vehemently denounced threats if the villany that was begun should be carried into execution Not all the quieting hints of my assistants could keep my anger under I lost all patience at every word My utmost indignation was excited by so black a business  The situation was not a new one to the dealer in the alphabet He was an old depredator and had before encountered angry authors and artful lawyers He was cool collected and unabashed Not indeed entirely but sufficiently so to excite astonishment  He affirmed the copyright to be his own would prove he had obtained it legally and would face any prosecution that we could bring He knew what he was about and was not be frightened He had printed one edition and had no doubt that several would be sold He was an honest tradesman and must not be robbed of his profits What would the country be if it were not for trade It ought to be protected ay and would be too The law was as open to an industrious fair trader as to any lord in the land Let him too be no loser and then it would be a different thing but as for big words they broke no bones and he knew his ground  The hints of the honest trader were too broad to be misunderstood and Quisque replied"I think you mean sir that you wish to be repaid the expence you have sustained"  The fellow answered with the utmost effrontery "I have a right sir to be indemnified for the loss of my profits on the sale of the work"  Anger and argument were equally vain There were two ways of proceeding Silence and safety might be purchased or the law might be let loose on a knave who set it at defiance The one was secure the other problematical and replete with the danger which we wished to avert  Quisque asked him what was the sum that he demanded His reply was more moderate than from appearances we had reason to expect it was one hundred pounds  Glibly desired he would permit us to consult five minutes among ourselves He withdrew and the fluent agent remarked  the sum was a trifle but trifling as it was he had no doubt but feelings of delicacy and honor would dictate that it ought to be jointly paid by the three parties principally concerned  He had urged a motive which I knew not how to resist and I gave my assent By this manoeuvre he gained the point which he intended He implicated me as paying to suppress a pamphlet which according to his interpretation I at present allowed to be defamatory and unjust  The money however was paid and the copies of the pamphlet were delivered and being determined if possible to avoid such another accident those that I had caused to be printed were dislodged from their garret both editions a single copy of each excepted were taken into the fields by night and burned and thus expired a production which had aided to drain my pocket waste my time and inflame my passions  END
