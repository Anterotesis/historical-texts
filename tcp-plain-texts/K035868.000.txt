 A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A DISSENTER AND THE OBSERVATOR CONCERNING  The Shortest Way with the  DISSENTERS  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCIII  A DIALOGUE c  Dissen  PRAY Sir are you the Author of the  Observator  Obser  Suppose it Sir what then  Dis  Nay don't be angry are you the reputed Author  A  Come off  you Taught me in one of your Papers about  Mr  F  Obs  And what then  Dis  Why I wanted a little Civil Discourse with you  Obs  If it be Civil as you say you are Welcome but you begin but odly  Dis  My Questions may be blunt but you are not bound to Answer them but let that be as you like 'em  First Pray who do you reckon is the Author of this Devilish Book call'd  The Shortest Way  Obs  I shall Answer most of your Questions with a Question I believe and begin with you here  Do you think my Name is Mr  Bellamy  that you take me for  an Informer  read the  Gazett  there you have the Man with the  Sharp Chin  and a  Dutch Nose  Dis  Ay but Sir we begin to doubt that is not the true Author that he has been only made the Tool of some other party who now they find the World Exasperated at it have slipt out of the Noose and left him in it we begin to be afraid the thing is a Reality and there is such a design on foot  Obs  Your Answer like Parson  Jacobs  Text ought to be taken a pieces and Explain'd  If you are not sure he is the Author you  Dissenters  have done him a great deal of wrong for you have rail'd at him more than all the rest of the World and charg'd him with more Crimes than 'tis well possible for one Man to be Guilty of  And yet by supposing him not to be the Author you suppose him to be very Honest to his friends that he bears all this without discovering them  As for your fears of a real design to put the  Shortest way  in practice upon you no Question there are abundance of People in the World who would be glad there was not one of you left I believe no body doubts it  Dis  Pray who do you think they are  Obs  Sir your Humble Servant no  Bellamy I  tell you not  I  Sir If I were in a Plot with the Devil I'le never turn Evidence besides Sir  I  have no mind to have my Nose and Chin describ'd but if you please I'le Answer you Negatively who I believe are not concern'd in it  Dis  That may be some satisfaction Sir  Obs  Not the Queen Sir not the Parliament not the Council not the Army not the Ministers of State not the Government  Dis  Thou art a safe Man thoul't never go to  Newgate  for Negatives  Obs  No Sir nor for Positives neither if I can help it but you have had your will at Catechising and I ought to have my turn let me ask you a few Questions too  Dis  You are welcome  Obs  Pray why are you  Dissenters  Angry at the Book call'd  The Shortest Way  'Tis a little Mysterious Sir that the  Church Men  are Affronted because t'was Writ against them and the  Dissenters  are Affronted because tis Wrote against them too I don't well understand it 'ne sort must be Fools that's certain  Dis  I don't care whether I understand it or no he is a  Rogue  a  Villain  and I wish the Government had him if I knew where he was I'd deliver him up  and abate them the  l  Obs  Spoken like a  Dissenter  truly so that I find you are Angry at him because you don't understand him and the Government because they do  Dis  You are so sharp upon me I do understand a a little too I understand he meddl'd with that he had nothing to do with and he is the Man they say who has been the occasion of all this Persecution which is coming upon us by railing at  Occasional Conformity  Obs  If he expos'd you for  Occasional Conformity  'tis what you ought to have rectifi'd your selves that you need not have been expos'd for it and in that he was your Friend for had you took the hint and exploded the Practice there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it  Dis  But what had he to do with that  Obs  Nay What had Mr  How  to do to meddle with it afterward I'll assure you his Name is down in my Pocket Book and when any Man in  England  defends a cause worse I'll put his Name out and put t'others Name in But pray Sir why do you call this bringilng Persecution upon you do you suppose the  Occasional  Bill will be a Persecution  Dis  Without doubt it will  Obs  What sort of Persecution can you call it it can't be a Persecution for Conscience sake  Dis  Why so Sir  Obs  Why pray Sir suppose one of your Brethren  Dissenters  who can go to the  Meeting  to Day and to the  Church  to Morrow take the  Sacrament  to Day sitting and to Morrow to get a good place go to  Church  and take it kneeling wipe his Mouth and go home to  Dinner and so to the  Meeting  again suppose this Genleman should be put up for  Sherriff  or  Lord Mayor  can this Man pretend Conscience not to Conform I tell you Sir Mr  How  must make a better Answer to the matter before I can be convinc'd you may call it Persecution but it can never be for Conscience sake  Dis  Persecution is Persecution let it be for what sake it will every man ought to be at liberty  Obs  Ay that is true  am for Liberty for every man to serve God as is most agreeable to his Conscience But this is not serving God at all besides Sir I could easily make it appear this Act is for your advantage if ye were a sort of People were to be convinc'd  Dis  Pray how Sir  Obs  Why Sir it will purge you of all your half in half Professors That's one thing then it will put all those Gentlemen into a capacity of being in places and Parliaments who tho' by this Act they are separated from you and rejoin'd to the Church because they can conform will still be friends to your Interest in all Publick Concerns and therefore had I been to word the Bill so as to have done most harm it shou'd have excluded all that ever were Dissenters and have forc'd you to continue so and not have accepted your return to the Church without a publick Repentance  Dis  Well well you may perswade us 'tis for our advantage but we don't like it and therefore we hate him for medling with it for what had he to do with it  Obs  About as much as you and I have to do with him if a man meddles with what does not concern him that's his Fault and if we who really have nothing to do with him meddle with him that is our Fault let the Government alone with him have you nothing else to talk on  Dis  Why all the Town has talkt of him as wellas we  Obs  Yes and reckon'd up all his Faults all the  sins that ever he committed in his Life and abundance more be the man who he will and what he will I don't see but the best of us would be loth all the Faults we have should be reckon'd up and writ in our Foreheads as his are  Dis  Oh he has been a most wicked Wretch  Obs  You force a man to be an Advocate for One he has no kindness for a wicked wretch you say why what has he been a Thief a Murderer  Dis  No no  I  don't mean that way  Obs  What has he been a Clipper or Coyner  Dis  No no nor that neither  Obs  Has he been a Whoremaster or a Drunkard or a Swearer  Dis  No I can't say so neither but he broke and can't pay his Debts  Obs  If you had said he had broke and won't pay his Debts you had said more to the purpose  But I must do one piece of Justice to the man though  I  love him no better than you do that is this That meeting a Gentleman in a  CoffeeHouse  where I and every body else was railing at him the Gentlemen took us up with this short Speech  Gentlemen said he I know this D  Foe  as well as any of you and  I  was one of his Creditors and  I  compounded with him and discharg'd him fully and several years afterward he sent for me and tho' he was clearly discharg'd he paid me all the Remainder of his Debt voluntarily and of his own accord and he told me that as fast as God should enable him he Intended to do so with every body when he had done he desir'd me to set my hand to a Paper to acknowledg it which  I  readily did and found a great many Names to the Paper before me and  I  think my self bound to own it tho'  I  am no Friend to the Book he has wrote  no more than you What do you think of this story  Dis  Think of it I do'nt believe it  Obs  I  can't help that nor  I  care not whether you do or no but I assure you after  I  heard it I never rail'd at him any more  Dis  Ay but I'll rail at him for all that  Obs  You Dissenters are in something like Case with the  Pharisees  when the Question was put to them by our Saviour about  Johns  Baptism whether it was from Heaven or of Men If a man should ask you of the  Shortest way  was it wrote for you or against you If you should say for us you would be askt why then are you so mad with the Author And if you should say against you the People would laugh at you for all men but you see into it and that a Dissenter wrote it you must say therefore we cannot tell and consequently that you rail at the Author for you can't tell what  Dis  But we don't count him a Dissenter  Obs  He has all the marks of a Dissenter upon him but  mant of Brains  Dis  Why are we so empty of Brains pray  Obs  There's reason for it God has given you  Equivalents  Dis  I don't understand you  Obs  That's a further Testimony of your being a Dissenter why if you will have it take it I say  God Almighty would have seem'd unkind to you if he had not given you a great deal of Grace For he has given you but little Wit  Dis  Well  I hope they'l take him still  I should be glad to see him hang'd for it I am sure he deserves it I heard one met him a little while ago wou'd  I  had been there  Obs  Alone do you mean Sir or to have helpt the other  Diss  Any how so I could but have taken him  Obs  'Twas in  Hackney Fields  was it not  Dis  Yes  I  think so  Obs  Ay and they say 'twas one of your own Party too and one that wou'd fain have got the  l  but that he drew upon him frighted him out of his Wits and made him down of his Knees and swear that if ever he met him again he should shut his eyes till he was half a mile off him  Diss  I  don't think he's such a fighting Fellow  Obs  Do you know him  Diss  No not I  Obs  So I thought by your Charity and good Nature I know him not neither but the man has the Government upon his Back already and if they take him they'l avenge your Quarrel for you Let him alone 'tis Ingenerous as I said before in print to triumph over a man in his Affliction 'twas but a little while ago he wrote a Book that pleas'd you and then you cry'd him up as much as now you cry him down  Dis  What Book pray  Obs  Why the New Test of Church of  England  Loyalty  Diss  Did he write that Book  Obs  I  told you I was no Informer go ask Mr  Bellamy  Dis  why truly that was a good thing I lik't it fully 'Twas well done but this cursed  Shortestway  is the Devil he must be turn'd Rogue now what ever he was then  Obs  Why this 'tis to oblige a  Dissenter  if you serve them a hundred times 'tis well but once get your Head in the Pillory for them and they'l be the first to palt you with rotten Eggs what can't you set down one good thing and one bad and ballance with him You understand  Accompts well enough but you  Dissenters  are like a Shop keeper I knew who having traded Year with a Gentleman and serv'd all his Family and gotten a great deal of money by him at last the poor Gentleman fell to decay and owing him  s  the Shopkeeper abus'd him and call'd him all the Knaves and Rogues for cheating of him of s  Dis  No no this has spoylt all  Obs  Well but wee'l go back further with you There's the  Reformation of Manners  and the  True bornEnglishman  there he pleas'd you for certain for he is for reforming your Magistrates  Dis  I  don't understand them  I  am for Reformation as much as any Body  Obs  But what say you to the Legion Paper  Dis  Ay that was a good thing indeed  Obs  Well but if he had been taken in doing that wou'd you not have call'd him as many Rogues then as you do now  Dis  No indeed shou'd I not  Obs  But I don't find you call him one Rogue the less for it now and that's hard  Diss  Well But you see he denyes it and challenges you to prove it  Obs  Ay deny it I told you he was no Fool indeed I am not glad I printed it for tho' it is charged upon him by common Fame I am not for hanging men upon suppositions as you do  Diss  Well you do well and I think 'tis a little hard  the man is gone  and tho' he has done ill he might mean no harm and so let him alone  I reckon you won't be long before you follow him  Obs  And when I am gone you'l call me as many Rogues as you do him won't you  Dis  No it may be  I  shan't but I can tell you of some that do already  Obs  It's all one to me common Fame like a common Strumpet jilts every Body but methinks Slander and Reproach out of the mouth of a Dissenter comes with some more than common ill favour  Diss  They think they have good reason for it upon you  Obs  And I think not pray what are their good reasons  Diss  For abusing your Friends  Obs  My Friends prithee who are they I know but very few  I  have and I am very sure  I  never abus'd them  Dis  They all agree you would not be permitted to write so long but the party would have ruffled you before now only you court them and please them by a SideWind with your railing at King  William  's Friends sometimes  Obs  King  William  's Enemies you mean look Sir I have as much veneration for the Memory of King  William  as any of you and do but once prove them to be King  William  's Friends and I'll own all you say and recant all I have wrote  Dis  It's easy to prove they were his Friends  Obs  Pray Sir don't you tax me with abusing King  VVilliam  and abuse him your self  I  have prov'd sufficiently they were the Nations Enemies Now if you can prove the Nations Enemies were King  VVilliam  's Friends you'l make a fine spot of work on't indeed  Diss  The Nations Enemies That is because being in great places they got as much money as they could and so would you do and so have all the Favourites that ever were or will be  Obs  When ever Favourites did do or shall get money by rapine or injustice and oppression of the subject they were and will be the Nations Enemies and their Soveraigns too  Diss  But what have you to do with it 'tis none of your business  Obs  'Tis every Mans business to discover mischief fraud and ill design as much as every Man who first spies Fire has a duty upon him to raise the Neighbours  I  am a Subject and am Cheated among the rest  Dis  You Cheated why what have you to lose  Obs  Why my Liberty which you said but now every Man had a Right to and my Money when I have it what's that to you how little or much  I  have and how do you know how much  I  may have hereafter  Dis  Nay they say you get Money by Railing and so you may soon be Rich  Obs  Then  I  Rail for something and you get none and yet you Rail pray who has the best Excuse for it  Dis  He that has the best Reason for it not he that gets the most Money by it  Obs  I  believe if you could get Money by Railing you would count it the best Reason in the World  Dis  Why so  Obs  Because you are so willing to Rail at any body when you know not for what nor why and charge People with Crimes they never Committed of all your Christian Dutyes you make the least use of your Charity  Dis  Why since you put so hard  I  can tell the time when you abus'd King  William  himself as openly as you durst speak it or any body dare Print particularly in a Poem of yours call'd the  Foreigners  Obs  How do you prove 'twas mine  Dis  Nay they say 'twas yours you were the Reputed Author as you said in another case  Obs  I  tell you there's no People in the World so forward to Condemn a Man upon hear say as the  Dissenters  when they have a Mind to slander a man they take every thing upon trust 'tis their  Shortest way  Dis  These Scribling People are always medling with things they have nothing to do with what have you to do with Kings and Favourites or that t'other Fellow with the  Shortest Way  you Pamphleteers are always Quacking with the State  Obs  Come let's turn the Tables now it's my Play what have you to do with Acts of Parliamenrs you  Dissenters  are always thrusting in your Oar too what have you to do to talk of Persecution and Acts against  Occasional Conformity  you are Mountebanking with the State too in every CoffeeHouse pray meddle with your own business  Dis  We shall have to do with it when we feel it  Obs  I  am perswaded if you were put to it severely few of you would stay to feel it at least few of your Wealthy Members few of Mr  Hows  mind few of such  Dissenters  as go from  Meetting  to  Church  and can backstroke and forestroke Communicate on both sides  Dis  I  wish they may not but we are afraid 'twill not only be a Persecution but a very long one  Obs  Why then you are beholding to the Author we talkt of for you see he is for putting you out of your Pain but I am of a different Opinion from you in several of your darkest thoughts about Persecution  Dis  Pray what is your Opinion  Obs    I  am of Opinion that if your Enemies were true Masters of Politicks they would not Persecute you at all I take you to be a declining Party Toleration will be your Ruin and if God in Mercy to you don't send a Persecution among you you are lost you will all dwindle back into the  Church  again your old stock of Ministers dye off your  Owens Mantons Charnocks Clarksons Baxters  and  Bates  's are gone and pray what can you name out of the new Generation of your  Leyden  Doctors fit to succeed them  The Occasional Bill at once carries off your Wealthy Members who are the support of your Clergy and as Mr  William's  very well observed at  SaltersHall If the Rich ones forsake you the party will be weaken'd so as to make you fear the Dissolution of the whole  Indeed the Gentleman was in the right if the Wealthy Members quit the Congregations 'twill make poor work for the Ministers and they like other People Generally do their work best where they have best Wages  Dis  I  thought you had Lov'd the  Dissenters  better than to abuse them at this rate  Obs  I don't abuse them I wish them clear of all their Hypocrites and that there were none among them but what were  Dissenters  for meer Conscience  if that were so 'twould make their Enemies at Peace with them they'd never be Persecuted the Government would Cherish them and be as tender of them as they would desire But to be plain with you 'tis your own Pride and Pushing at great things has made you Obnoxious and withall your discovering by an Alternate doublefac'd Conscience that while you pretend to Dissent and to have tender Consciences you can nevertheless Conform if you plaese this makes your Enemies suspect your Honesty and apprehend more trick and design in you than  I  hope they need Nay this gives your Enemies such advantage against you as you can never Answer  Dis  I  do not think any Man ought to be confin'd by Laws and Acts of Parliaments about his Religion  Obs  It may be I think so too but Men ought to be Honest to their own Principles whether there were Laws or no and if I see a Man pretend he can't Conform and upon occasion I find he can it makes me suspect his Honesty and if I once think a Man a Knave I am not to blame to fence my self against him by Laws I tell you an Act of Parliament to keep you Honest can never be call'd Persecution  Dis  Ay if there was no more in it  Obs  If there be any more in it I wish there was not I'm sure I know not what is in it and I believe you don't neither pray have you seen the Bill  Dis  No not I but I hear 'tis a very Terrible Bill  Obs  True to the old way still  always to judge before you hear  Indeed  I  forgot to ask you but on  my Conscience  I  don't believe you ever read the Book of the  Shortest way  Come be honest  Diss  Read it why the very Outside of that is enough for any man to read I thank God  I  spend my time better  Obs  I  think you ought to spend your time better too than to give your Verdict upon any thing before you read it  Diss  You are a strange man why every body says 'tis a horrible Book and not fit to be read but what's that to this Act of Parliament  Obs  Why thus much 'tis that you cry out Persecution from this Act of Parliament and there's not a word of Persecution in it  Diss  I  think 'tis Persecution if  I  must not be at liberty to worship God as  I  think fit  Obs  Still you are without Book why you may be a Dissenter all the days of your life and go to Meetings as long as you live and never be troubled by this Act  Diss  I  can't imagine what you mean why  I  must pay God knows what if I am seen at a Meeting  Obs  Ay Sir that's after you have strain'd your Conscience from the Meeting to the Church after you have bob'd your Religion to be Sheriff of  London  or the like and then want to go back again but if you to keep your Conscience can be content to be without these gay things call'd Places you may be a Dissenter to the end of the Chapter So that this will only be a Persecution for Honour sake not for Conscience sake and never fall upon you neither till you bring it upon your self  Diss  Well  I  hope it won't pass for all that  Obs  I  hope so too but if it don't it must be  the Lords doing and it will be marvellous in our eyes  Diss  The House of Lords you mean I suppose  Obs  I must mean as you will have me let it be how it will but if I hope it will not pass it's from different reasons with you  Diss  Pray your reasons  Obs  Because I am against and ever shall be Imposing any religious Ordinance or part of Worship as a Qualification for any temporal Employment Let the Princes be at full liberty to employ who or what sort of their Subjects they see Cause Such Impositions are a Bait to People to banter their Consciences and to comply with that for a Preferment which otherwise they wou'd not and so seem to lead them into Temptation But I don't know the Contents of the Bill therefore I'll say no more  Diss  And I wou'd not have it pass because I take it to be a Foundation of Persecution 'tis but pulling down the Toleration next and then we are all undone  Obs  You Faithless and perverse Generation  Has not the QUEEN promis'd to maintain your Toleration Besides what's that to the Bill  Diss  Why shou'd not we be  afraid  of it as well as some of the Churchparty have the confidence to  hope  it Nay to condemn the Toleration as Antichristian and threaten us with the having it overthrown  Obs  Why these are for  the Shortest way  you ought to rail at them as much as you do at the man with the  book Nose  and  sharp Chin  and more too and no doubt if you would but turn Informer you might hook their Noses into the  Gazett  too to be sure the Government would not allow of it they would never suffer the QUEEN to be so affronted  Diss  I don't know how 'tis such things are suffer'd daily I heard our Parson t'other day say at a Publick Dinner 'twou'd never be well with  England  till some Course was taken to reconcile all Dissenters to the Church  Longest way  or  Shortest  'twas all one to him he said he hop'd to see the Church flourish without them and a great deal more and worse than this  Obs  That was a topping highflying Gentleman indeed and why did you not acquaint the Government with it  Diss  What do you think I am an Informer My Name is not  Bellamy  any more than yours but pray why do you make so strange of it Don't we hear daily People expressing their highflying hopes that a Parliament in  Scotland  will restore Episcopacy there and yet has not the QUEEN given her word and published it in our  Gazett  that she will maintain the Presbyterian Government there  Obs  Has she so Then tho' they have the impudence to hope you ought not to have the ignorance to fear it The QUEEN gave her word to maintain  it  be not slow of Heart to believe  She has taken up the famous Motto of  Q Flizabeth Semper eadem  and can you so much as doubt she will deface it for a few Scotch Bishops  Diss  I am sorry for my Fears I beg her Majesties pardon there are so many Turns and Windings in Law and State matters that we know not what to say to things  Obs  Say Why a promise is a promise and you may depend upon it she has never broke her word with us yet  Diss  Ay but what if the Parliament shou'd do it  Obs  Nay If the Parliament does it we do it our selves  Diss  Very good so that we may be undone and the Toleration Bill taken away and yet the QUEEN be as good as her word still  Obs  Yes Sir so you may whenever an Act of Parliament becomes so without the Royal assent and when do you think that can be  Diss  Why then these highflying Churchmen are very impudent Fellows to suggest such things of the QUEEN and to bully us with overturning the Toleration and put us in such fears of what they will do to us when it can never be done without the QUEEN's acting so directly against her Royal Promise  Obs  Well and what then  Dis  Why  I  think they ought to be us'd as they us'd the Author of the  Shortest Way  Gazetted and a Reward for the Discoverer  Obs  Or as you have us'd him rather  viz Rail at them for being of your own side  you  Dissenters  are rare Fellows for Punishments if God should have no more Mercy on you than you shew to all Men that offend you we should have  Plagues Pestilence  and  Famine  every Year upon us so now you are come about again these high Flying  Church Men  have bully'd you with the fears of losing your Toleration come confess  Dis  Yes  Obs  And made you distrust the QUEEN's Veracity  Dis  Yeas GOD and the QUEEN forgive us  Obs  And have Terrifi'd you with what things they'l do when they have pull'd down your Antichristian Toleration have they not  Dis  Ay Ay  Obs  And so you thought the  Shortest Way  was Wrote to make a begining with you and to set the  Dragoons of the Church  upon your Backs did you not  Dis  'Tis very true  Obs  And continued of the same mind like an  Ignoramus  tho' you heard 'twas Wrote by one of your own Party  Dis  Indeed I did  Obs  Now pray after so much patience as I have had with you have a little with me and if I can I'le set you right in your Thoughts of these things  There are a sort of People among the  Dissenters  who can either Dissent or Conform as they find their Inclinations or Interest rather directs them these by their Wealth and Interest have always put themselves into good places and qualifi'd themselves for that purpose by taking the Sacrament of these People even the most moderate  Church Men  have an ill Opinion and truly so have Two Thirds of your own Friends for it looks as if they were Men of no Principles at all  Against these Men the Act against  Occasional Conformity  is principally design'd and if there was nothing else in the Bill I believe no good Man would be against it  Concerning these things Two sorts of People have been very grosly mistaken and upon their Mistakes have proceeded to Act very Foolishly  First  The high Flying  Church Party  begun to think all was a going their own way and that the Government would fall in with them and do your business for you and away they run with the Notion and Preach you down and Print you down and Talk you down like Mad Men there is Sermon upon Sermon Pamphlet upon Pamphlet One says you are all Rogues and Hypocrites another says you are Enemies to the Government one Flies at the Toleration and tells the World 'tis Destructive to the Nations Happiness and the Politicians must pull it down another says 'tis Antichristian and we cannot be true Sons of the Church of  England  if we don't pull it down others like harebrain'd Huntsmen that overrun the Hounds roar you down with full Cry till they run themselves out of Breath others are for having you depriv'd of Voices in Elections of Parliament in hopes of Arriving to that Blessed Day when they shall have a Parliament of their own Mind and thus they Run before they are Sent and without Reflecting upon their ill grounded Zeal without examining any Authorities other than their Passions without regard to good manners taking no Notice of the Preamble of the Act of Parliament which Declares against Persecution or the Honour and Sacred Promise of Her MAJESTY given to make Her Subjects easy they blow up the Fire of Persecution and Destruction whether the Government will or no  You are the next sort of People who are mistaken for being Naturally a little Hypish as the Beaus call it troubled with the Spleen and Hypocondriack Vapours this Cloud of Raillery so darken'd your Understanding that you presently take  these People and the QUEEN these People and the Government these People and the Parliament to be all of a mind and the QUEEN having displac't all your Friends as 'tis but just  That all Princes should employ who they please  And the Parliament falling on your  Occasional Conformers  and this Book of  the Shortest way  coming out altogether the high Church Party Thundred at you from the Press and the Pulpit Away you run with the Notion that you are all to be blown up that all these Things aim'd at your Destruction and that Fire and Faggot was at the door  But the Government is steady and the QUEEN still has maintained her Motto the Parliament steers in the middle way going about to restrain but not to destroy you and taking no notice either of the heat of one party or Folly of the other they hold the Ballance of your Liberty between your own exorbitant License and the other party's unchristian Fury and in my opinion thus far are you safe  Diss  But then why has not the Government thought fit to disown the Zeal of these Highflyers by punishment and make Examples of some of them  Obs  I told you the Dissenters were all for Punishments and Examples for the same reason that they have not punished you for suspecting the QUEEN's Honesty to her word charging the Parliament with going about to persecute you and the like for this reason because they are more merciful than both parties deserve  Dis  'Twould have convinc'd us very plainly of two very significant Things  First  That there is such a Design and then that the Authors of it receiv'd no Countenance from Court  Obs  Good Manners and Common Justice ought to have convinc'd you of the last and your Author of  the Shortest way  to his Cost open'd your Eyes in the first if you had not wilfully shut them against the Light  Good Manners would inform you not to doubt the Word of your Prince 'till you had some reason from her MAJESTY her self  Common Justice commands us to suppose every Person just and honest till something appears to the contrary and it is a very unchristian uncharitable way of treating the QUEEN That because some of the high Churchmen have had the Indiscretion without her Authority to swagger you out of your Senses therefore you must suppose her Promise broken and her Word of no value  The Author of  the Shortest way  comes with a Lanthorn for you and he summs up all the black Things this high Party had publish'd into one General and if you had any Eyes you might learn two Things from him  where he is like topay dear enough for teaching you  First  From the general abhorrence Mankind shew'd of the Book you might learn that the destruction of your Party is a Cruelty not to be found in the  English  Nature  Secondly  from the Outcry made against it by that Party in particular you might learn who they were that were toucht in the Book and where the design against them lay  As to the Quarrel you Dissenters have at the Book  that's a mystery no man can unriddle but your selves  'Tis like Mr  Mead  's Wheel within a Wheel and a further Testimony to the World that you are a most unaccountable People whose ways are past finding out  Diss  So that you would go about to perswade me the Book was writ of our side  Obs  First  Sir 'tis hard to know what side you are off and  Secondly  Sir I know you too well to go about to perswade you to any thing whose peculiar Talent is to be unperswadeable but if you will please to answer me a few Questions you may perhaps perswade your self of something or other  Diss  What Questions  Obs  Why are the high Churchmen angry with him while at the same time they openly declare 'tis the only way to deal with you and what they would feign be at  Dis  Truely you puzzle me a little there  Obs  They are angry because they take the Book as the Author meant it and you because you  take it as he wrote it they as he meant  viz to expose them  and tho' they are heartily willing to do you a Kindness that way and have shewn their good will by their words yet knowing they wanted power to execute it and being conscious to themselves that the Government was not of their Opinion they are enrag'd to have all their designs laid open in Minature and an Abridgment communicated to the World in  true Billinsgate  Dis  There may be some truth in this but pray why then is the Government so angry with him I believe I have puzzled you now  Obs  No no the Government may have Reasons to be angry that you nor I know not off nor have nothing to do with But what if I should suppose  That the Government not thinking any person could be so Barbarous as to harbour such a villainous Design as the Book suggests are displeas'd at it as an affront done to the  Church of England  to Father Principles of Cruelty and Destruction upon her Members which they are not guilty off  I say if I suppose this to be a Reason I believe you cannot suppose a better  Dis  I confess  I  begin to have better Thoughts of the Government than I had  Obs  I'm glad of that  Dis  I  begin to hope they won't persecute us now and as for  Occasional Conformity  what care I I shall never be Lord Mayor or Common Council man  If I am call'd to it 'tis time enough to come off then  Obs  God Almighty is wonderfully beholden to you when he calls you from a middle State to a good place you'l take it for granted He calls you from the Meeting to the Church and you'l be sure to come But I tell you you ought to be so far from the fear of a Persecution that if you have any respect to your Party you ought to pray for a Persecution upon them or ye are all undone  Dis  Why thou art mad thou art for the  Shortest way  Obs  No no I an't for such Persecution neither but I told you my mind before I am sure you have receiv'd more damage in your Interest as Disse nters and more weakned your Reputation as well as your Number Since the late Tolleration than ever your Enemies did for you by all the penal Laws Informers Fines and Prisons of the last Persecution  Dis  Well but here's another danger upon us that we han't talkt of yet and fear it will come upon us too  Obs  Pray what's that  Dis  We are affraid that this restless Party will overthrow our Settlement for they do not stick to talk that way  Obs  We affraid who do you mean by we Are not the  Church of England  as much concern'd in the Settlement as you and more too as they are the major part of the Nation and We if you will  give me leave to talk your way We Protestants fear nothing for our Settlement and for this I'll give you a Quotation from the man with the hook Nose and sharp Chin it may be you won't like it because of the Author but his words are these  "The Settlement of the Crown says he is the Basis of our  Religion Laws  and  Liberties  This is the solid Bottom on which we all stand and of which with respect to civil Right may be said  Other Foundation can no man lay than that which is Laid  'Tis the Rock on which we are all built and that stone of which according to the Scripture it may without prophaneness be said  Whosoever it falls upon he will be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to Powder  "'Tis the last thing the People of  England  will part with after all their Estates Wives and Children Churches and Houses are destroyed  "'Tis the Pledge of the Divine Goodness to the Nation which they purchased at the expence of millions of Money and the Blood of above  English  men in Eleven years War  "'Twas one of the great Things King  WILLIAM  did for us and the Treasure GOD and his MAJESTY left in our Hands in trust for our Posterity which if we part with our Children will curse our Memory and digg us out of our Graves  "'Tis a Thing so sacred the dissolving of it cannot be mention'd without a Crime nor so much as intended without being guilty of Treason in the most intense Degree  "'Tis the solid Prop upon which stands her present MAJESTIES Throne and the right and just Title she has to govern us  "'Tis like the two Pillars in the House of  Dagon  whoever pulls them down will like  Sampson  be buryed in the Ruines and pull the whole Nation upon their Heads  "  I  Fear nothing for this Settlement the Parliament of  England  are the Trustees for the seeing it forth coming to the People of  England  and a Parliament of  England  will never betray their trust  "The Parliament will not and all the rest of Humane Power dare not attempt to dissolve it no Weapon form'd against it can prosper  Dis  Is this done by our  Shortest way  Man  Obs  The very same  Dis  Well I shall love him the better for it But there's one thing more still what say you to the Prince of  Wales  If ever he comes again you'l be hang'd that's for certain  Obs  And if ever we let him come we ought all to be hang'd I can do no better than refer you to the same Author  "The Act of Settlement says he and the Prince of  Wales  are  the two Bucketts  keep one but up and the other must be down and put the one  down and the other comes up of Course There can be no pretence made to alter or dispose the Settlement but the Bringing in the Prince of  Wales  therefore whoever they are that mention it we ought to suppose they wou'd be so understood  Dis  So that you are of Opinion we are in no danger of our Settlement  Obs  Indeed I am of the Opinion your Fears both of the Prince of  Wales  and of altering the Settlement and of Persecution are all groundless and equally so I would only advise the Dissenters to be honest to their own Principles if they can conform they ought to do it if they cannot no body forces them let them dissent and not for the desire of preferment bring such a Scandal upon their Integrity as if they were Men of no Principles 'Tis scandalous to the very Name of a Dissenter and injurious to all the rest of that Body who are honest and conscientious  and so  I  bid you Farewel
