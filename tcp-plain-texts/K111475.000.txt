 THE GRECIAN HISTORY From the End of the  Peloponnesian  War to the Death of  Philip  of  Macedon Containing the Space of Sixtyeight  YEARS  By TEMPLE STANYAN  Esq  VOLUME  the  SECOND  Now Originally Publish'd  LONDON Printed for J and R TONSON in the  Strand  MDCCXXXIX  PREFACE  _HAVING promis'd a Second Volume of this History when I publish'd the First it is now become a Debt of so many Years standing that I don't know whether the bare discharging it will be thought sufficient without saying something in Excuse for my having deferr'd it so long And yet upon second Thoughts I believe I might easily have been forgiven if I had never discharg'd it For the World is not so rigid in demanding Debts of this kind as we Authors imagine But to deal plainly I have been many Years employ'd in Business of another kind tho' I must confess it has been with very little Advantage to the Publick or Myself and much less do  I propose any great Benefit to arise to either from this Undertaking However it has serv'd to shift the Scene a little and to gratify my own Inclinations in renewing my Acquaintance with those Studies which I have formerly pursu'd  I have pleas'd myself with the Thoughts of doing some sort of Justice to the Memory of a Race of Worthies who may be call'd the first Assertors of publick Liberty And if I have not succeeded so well in it as I could wish I hope it will be imputed rather to the Nature of the Subject than to any want of my Endeavours In the former Part of this History I did not find it an easy Task to take off that Veil of  Fable  and  Fiction  which has been thrown over the first Ages of  Greece  and to introduce in the room of it something like the  Colouring  of History And even in the later Times which are call'd  Historical  I have met with too much Intricacy and Confusion in the treating of so many separate States in unravelling their different Interests in describing their different Manners and Customs and Forms  of Government and in connecting the Whole with the Body of the Story  In the Progress of this Work I have found more Difficulties of this kind than I apprehended at my first Entrance upon it and it is that which I believe has chiefly discourag'd others from undertaking it For I cannot otherwise conceive how it should happen that the History of a Country which has been the Scene of so much Action within itself and which has given Birth to so many great Events in other Parts of the World should be so much neglected I do not mean that it has been wholly buried in the Rust and Ruins of Antiquity but it certainly has not receiv'd a due Proportion of those Improvements which have been made of late Years both in Ancient and Modern History as well as in other Arts and Sciences For tho' there have been many Parts of the Affairs of the  Grecians  extracted from their Historians and Biographers Poets Orators and Philosophers with great Variety of Glosses and Comments upon 'em yet they are in such detach'd Pieces and  so unmethodiz'd that they can only serve as the Groundwork for a more regular Composition and as such I have made use of them There are some Collections of this kind which are more in the Form of History But the Facts contain'd in them are related in so dry and lifeless a manner that there is nothing of the true Spirit of  Greece  in them And a further Objection to them is that they are intermix'd with the Affairs of other Nations which have no relation to them This is the Method observ'd by the Writers of  Universal History  whose chief Merit is the preserving the Order of Time but for the sake of that they invert the Order of Place and hurry you on from one Country to another without any natural Agreement or Connection Such a confused Variety of Matter may do well enough when it is comprised in those short  Compendiums  of  Chronology  which are design'd to imprint on the Memory the Dates of the most remarkable Events as they have happen'd in the World But the relating things at length in an Historical Way and  blending together Sacred Story and Profane Ancient and Modern Foreign and Domestick as it distracts the Mind of the Reader too much so it is a Work of too great Labour and Extent for the Writer to be throughly executed  He who has succeeded best in this way is  Monsieur Rollin  who has cull'd out the Flowers of the  Grecian  Story and interspers'd them in the Accounts which he has given of the other ancient Kingdoms and Commonwealths But besides the relating things by Piecemeal in the confus'd manner beforemention'd he has omitted several Particulars which are material and in others which are not so he is too circumstantial And his Reflections tho' they are generally just are too frequent and too tedious too trite and obvious and too juvenile However they may be suited to the Design of his Province in the Institution of Youth and may serve as Lectures to instil into their Minds Principles of Virtue and Morality they are not so agreeable as they should be to the Laws of History which will allow of  very few Reflections but such as naturally arise to the Reader from a simple Relation of Facts or such at least as are interwoven in the Body of the Story so as not to break the Thread of it I would not be thought to detract from the Merit of a Work which has met with a pretty general Approbation and is now in every Body's Hands The Author has certainly taken great Care and Pains in it He is copious in his Matter faithful in his Authorities and clear and easy in his Narration and there is a Spirit of Liberty throughout the Whole which is well suited to the Subject and which few of his Countrymen except  Monsieur Tourreil  have attain'd to Wherefore tho' I had compos'd the following Sheets before his History appear'd in the World I will freely own that it has been of Service to me in the Revisal of them  I must likewise acknowledge the Lights I have receiv'd in several Passages of this History from the  Grecian Antiquities  of  The most Reverend the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury  who is no less eminent for his  extensive Knowledge in all Parts of Learning than for his other great Qualities And however this Work may have serv'd as an Amusement to  His Grace  in the early Course of his Studies it cannot now be thought unworthy of his more advanc'd Age nor unbecoming either his holy Profession or his high Station  Just before I sent these Sheets to the Press I met with  The History of  Epaminondas lately publish'd at  Paris  by the  Abb√© de la Tour  being intended to supply the Loss of that Life of him which was wrote by  Plutarch  I likewise receiv'd  A Discourse  in Manuscript upon the same Subject which had been pronounc'd in the  Academy of the Belles Lettres and Inscriptions  by the  Abb  eA Gedoyn  and which was communicated to me in a very obliging manner from  Monsieur de Fontenelle  I was desirous to see if any thing material had escap'd me in my Account of the greatest Man of  Greece  And the Perusal of these two Pieces has serv'd to clear up to me some doubtful Passages concerning him and to confirm me in others  As to this second Part of the  Grecian  Story it contains the Transactions of sixty eight Years which is not a twentieth Part of the Time compris'd in the first Volume But what it wants in the Number of Years is made up in the Variety of Events and the Fullness of the Materials This Compass of Time together with the twentyseven preceding Years of the  Peloponnesian  War was the most active and bustling Age of the  Grecians  who when they were freed from the Danger of a Foreign Enemy fell into such Dissensions as turn'd the Edge of the Sword against themselves and ended in the Destruction of that Liberty which they had so gloriously defended There were still among them some true Patriots who aim'd at nothing further than the general Safety of  Greece  and an equal Balance among the several Commonwealths But it was the fixing and preserving this Balance which created so much Difficulty and Disturbance Among so many different Governments and popular Assemblies it was hardly possible to avoid Confusion and Discord And the  Demagogues  and  other artful and designing Men from hence took occasion to perplex and inflame Matters still more in order to carry on their own selfish Views at the Expence of the Publick There was one Part of the Constitution of  Greece  well design'd to remedy these Inconveniences and that was the  Council of the Amphictyons  who were in the nature of  States General  and were intended not only to provide for the common Good and Safety of the Whole but to decide the Differences and adjust the Pretensions of each particular State and great Regard was paid to their Determinations But tho' they were conven'd twice a Year it was mostly for formsake so that except upon some very extraordinary Occasions they seldom did any thing that answer'd the End of their Institution The  Grecians  had other specious Shews of Liberty and their publick Harangues were full of it but it was chiefly in Shew and in Words for the Spirit of it was in a great measure lost The Band of Amity which had united them against the  Pers  ians  was dissolv'd The open generous  and disinterested Valour which they shew'd upon that Occasion began daily to degenerate into Sloth and Luxury Faction and Corruption Fraud and Violence The Greater States devour'd the Lesser and then prey'd upon one another In short the great Bone of Contention now among them was the Sovereignty of  Greece  which most of them aspir'd to in their turns and still as one Competitor fail'd in it there started up another Such was the convulsive State of  Greece  at the time of the  Peloponnesian  War and so it continued as long as it was a Nation There were indeed some quiet Intervals but they were short and such as serv'd rather to recover breath than to settle any course of Tranquillity  In relating these Wars of the  Grecians  among themselves the Reader is not to expect such great and surprising Incidents as those which happen'd in their Defence against the  Persians  He will not meet with such numerous Armies as those which came with all the Power of the  East  like  n Inundation upon them nor with such  signal Victories as those which have perpetuated the Names of  Marathon Salamis Plataea  and  Mycale  The Efforts which were then made for the Publick Liberty had something more than human in them and are not to be accounted for according to the ordinary course of Nature But however the  Eclat  of these illustrious Actions may raise our Attention and Admiration yet an Account of the intestine Quarrels which succeeded them will furnish us with more of that useful Knowledge and Instruction which is to be drawn from History There were fewer Numbers then brought into the Field and less Blood shed But the Merit of these later Victories consisted more in the Skill and Conduct of the Generals and the Discipline of the Troops than in the Number of the slain There were more Feints and Stratagems Marches and Countermarches Incampments and Decampments more surprising of Garrisons intercepting of Convoys debauching of Allies and cluding of Treaties In short the  Grecians  were now become much more  expert and refined in the Art of War and less prodigal of their Lives than when they had nothing but an hardy desperate Valour to oppose to the Multitudes of the  Barbarians  and when by that glorious Stand made at  Thermopylae  one part of them devoted themselves to certain death for the Preservation of the rest Hence it was that these civil Discords were protracted to a greater Length than could otherwise have been imagin'd For considering the Heat and Rancour with which they were carried on and that the Scene of Action lay in so narrow a Compass as  Greece  strictly so call'd it might naturally have been expected that things would sooner have been brought to some general Issue and that by some decisive Stroke one of the principal Republicks would have made an intire Conquest of the Whole Besides the Reasons already given for the long Continuance and the fatal Issue of these Wars another material one may be assign'd which is that the  Grecians  were not content to decide their own Quarrel without interesting Foreign Powers  in it Most of them to their eternal Reproach as they found themselves distress'd made mean Applications to their old Enemies the  Persians  who had found out the Secret of fomenting their Divisions and supporting one State against another in order to weaken the Whole  Philip  afterwards improv'd upon the Example the  Persians  had set him and thus in the end the  Grecian  Liberties were lost The Means by which this Change was effected and the Struggles which were now and then made by particular Persons and States for recovering the ancient Honour of  Greece  is chiefly the Subject of this Volume  Here it may not be improper to observe that notwithstanding these Commotions with which the whole Country was more or less agitated Arts and Sciences receiv'd daily Improvement and were carried on to a great degree of Perfection and there was more Politeness and Civility more Policy and Intrigue more good Writing and Speaking and a greater Variety of Men eminent in all Professions  than in any other Period of time in  Greece  or in any other Country in that Age of the World And as a thorough Knowledge of the Lives and Characters of these famous Men does very much conduce to the Knowledge of the History of the Times they liv'd in I have therefore been the more exact in describing them so as to distinguish their good and bad Qualities and to shew in what manner and in what degree they have been beneficial or hurtful to their Country In the doing this I have found it difficult to reconcile the different Accounts which have been given of them by some of the Historians of those Times who often clash with one another and sometimes even with themselves All that I could do in this case was to compare them together to supply the Defects of one out of another and to extract out of the whole those Particulars which appear'd to me the most rational and probable and most consistent with the common known Character of the Person I was describing I have observ'd the same Method with regard to Facts as well  as Persons throughout the Course of this History and where I have met with any essential Difference or manifest Contradiction I have taken notice of it as such in the Body of the Story  If we consider how many Volumes relating to the Affairs of the  Grecians  have been lost we might expect more Confusion and greater Chasms in their Story than there really are But it happens very fortunately that some of their best Writers and of the best Authority are still remaining particularly  Thucydides Xenophon  and  Demosthenes  who had a great Share in the Transactions they relate and were otherwise most remarkable for their Probity and Veracity So that the  Groecia mendax  of  Juvenal  cannot be thought applicable to these Writers or to the Times in which they flourish'd but must be understood only of the  Fabulous Age  which undoubtedly is a fitter Subject for the Extravagancies of Poetry than for the Gravity of an Historian I have accordingly consider'd it in that light and have gone no further into it than I found necessary in  order to make a beginning and to introduce the more solid and authentick Parts of the Story And herein I am sufficiently warranted by the Example of our own Historians who have not contented themselves with the wild Accounts of the ancient  Britons  but have had recourse to the  Trojan Brute  as our Founder And the  Scottish  Writers begin their Relations from a Son of  Cecrops  the  Athenian  or of  Argus  who lived an hundred Years before him And tho' there is no great Stress laid upon these early Accounts they are sufficient to shew that we have grafted upon the same Stock of  Fable  as the  Grecians  or rather carried it further and grafted one Fable upon another And the same Vani  y has prevail'd in several other Parts of  Europe  Here I cannot help observing how much it is to the honour of  Greece  that so many Nations have laid claim to her as their common Mother and that they have invented so many Fictions and Forgeries to be consider'd as  Grecian  Colonies when they might more naturally and with more  Credibility have drawn their Descent from some imaginary Heroes of their own But it was the establish'd Fame and the real Merit of  Greece  that made them so fond of being allied to her It was the Learning Wit and Delicacy of  Athens  the Laws and Discipline of  Sparta  and the Valour and Love of Liberty throughout the whole Country which put them upon forming these Pretensions in hopes that by calling themselves  Grecians  they should be thought to inherit their Virtues and to act upon their Principles And in some Respects they have copied after them particularly in their Forms of Government which have serv'd as Models to several considerable States in this Part of the World but with such Variations and Improvements as the Wisdom of the later ages has found necessary For tho' the general Plan of Government in  Greece  was founded upon Principles of Liberty there were great Errors and Defects in it which I have cursorily taken notice of in relating the Tumults and Disorders that have been occasion'd by them Some of these Imperfections  are still retain'd in the Republicks which are now subsisting in  Europe  and others have been added by refining too much and aiming at more Perfection than that sort of Government is capable of I know there have been several Attempts to shew that there may be such a thing as a perfect Commonwealth But how plausible soever the Arguments for it may appear in Writing they are not easily to be reduc'd to Practice so as to prevent the Tyranny of  The Few  in an  Oligarchy  or the Licentiousness of  The Many  in a  Democracy  This was the Case of the two principal States of  Greece  upon which most of the others were founded  In  Sparta  indeed according to the Settlement of  Lycurgus  there was the Appearance of a limited Monarchy but it was too limited first by the Authority of the Senate and afterwards of the  Ephori  who tho' they were originally instituted only as a Barrier between the Senate and the People soon became the supreme Magistrates and were superior to the Kings in every thing but the Name However  the Government subsisted long under this Form and the  Roman  Commonwealth was founded upon it the  Consuls  Answering to the two  Spartan  Kings and the  Tribunes of the People  to the  Ephori  But these  Roman  Magistrates had greater Power and made a worse use of it especially the  Tribunes  who under colour of protecting the People in their just Rights became the Authors of most of the Seditions Tumults Murthers and civil Discord which happen'd in the most busy Times of the Commonwealth As in  Sparta  the Power of the Kings was too much restrain'd so in  Athens  the Power of the People was too excessive and nothing but some middle Scheme between these Extremes can be suppos'd to answer the true Ends of Government I might from hence take occasion to extol the Happiness of our own Constitution which is so equally poiz'd by a due Distribution of Power on the one hand and of Liberty on the other But perhaps some may think the Boundary Lines between them are drawn so fine as not to be easily perceptible at least this is  the most plausible Pretence for the many PartyDisputes among us and the best way of accounting for our frequent Alarms and Jealousies lest one Part of the Constitution should break in and make Encroachments upon the other These are bad Effects but they proceed from a good Cause and however some Particulars may be affected by them they have seldom gone so far as to endanger the Safety of the Whole So that notwithstanding these Inconveniences we are in the main much happier than any of our Neighbours who reproach us with them and our Liberty is better secured to us than it could be in any of the Republicks of  Greece  or in any of those Regal Governments in  Europe  which tho' they were form'd upon the same Model with ours have now very little Remains of their original Institution I have made a further Digression from my Subject than I intended But in speaking of the  Grecian  Governments and of those which have been grafted upon them I could not as an  Englishman  resist the Temptation of saying something in Preference of our own  which is certainly the nearest to Perfection and is attended with very few Evils but such as are of our own making  But to return to  Greece  I have rather chose to finish my Account of it with the Death of  Philip  of  Macedon  than to carry it on to his Successor For the Affairs of  Alexander  besides that they are already related by others in a fuller and more unbroken manner than those of the preceding Times are not strictly speaking to be look'd upon as a Continuation of the  Grecian  Story since they relate almost entirely to  Macedonia  and  Persia  Some indeed of the  Grecians  took occasion from the Absence of  Alexander  in his  Eastern  Expedition to attempt the Recovery of their Liberty but he soon return'd upon them and by the Destruction of  Thebes  and the Victory afterwards obtain'd over the  Peloponnesians  by  Antipater  his Viceroy in  Macedonia  he struck such a Terror into the whole Country that he kept them in a quiet Subjection so that if he had liv'd to return again into  Grecce  he would have found it very easy to annex it to his own  Dominions and to destroy the very Name of it However the  Grecians  still subsisted but in so low and lifeless a Condition that from the Time of  Alexander  's Captains till they were subdu'd by the  Romans  there were very few among them who were distinguish'd for Arms and Counsels and not many for Arts and Learning So that except the famous League of the  Achaian  under  Aratus  and  Philopoemen  and the Endeavours of  Agis  and  Cleomenes  to recover the State of  Sparta  from the Encroachments of the  Ephori  there is very little worth recording  CONTENTS  BOOK I FROM the End of the Peloponnesian

the Peloponnesian War to the Death of Socrates Containing the Space of YEARS  _THE Victory of  Lysander  was so terrible a Shock to  Athens  that tho' she gather'd Strength enough to survive it she could never perfectly recover it From a Prospect of bringing the War  o an happy Issue she found herself in one Hour  reduced to the lowest ebb of Fortune and lay at the Mercy of those whom she had so lately insulted For the Terms obtain'd by the las  Treaty amounted to little more than surrendering at Discretion So that from hence we ma  date the  Fall of the  Athenian  Empire  which began soon after the Defeat of the  Persians  at  My cale  and continued about seventy three Years However the Conquerors were so generous a  not wholly to extinguish the Name of  Athen  They said  They would not be guilty of putting ou  one of the Eyes of  Greece And this agrees wit  what  Plutarch  relates of  Lysander  That when h  sent word to  Sparta That the  Athenians  were taken  the Magistrates wrote back to him  It is su  ficient to have taken them  But it is certain they imposed some further Marks of their Conque  on them Of which the most particular was that they obliged the People to break up th  Democracy  and submit to the Government o  Thirty Men who are commonly known by the Name of  The Thirty Tyrants  The Thirty Tyrants A M Olymp  This Change wa  owing chiefly to  Lysander  who about the same time introduced the  Oligarchy  into  Samos  an  other Places which he took in as tributary t  Athens  In most of them he establish'd a  D  cemvirate  which was modell'd according to hi  Directions and made up of his own Creature  And thus he treated not only the Enemies bu  the Allies of  Sparta  by which means he had in manner engross'd to himself the whole Empire  Greece  Having settled his Conquests  Lysander returns in triumph to Sparta  he returned in triumph to  Sparta  with the  Athenian  and other Gallies and fifteen hundred Talents in Mony together with a great deal of rich Booty besides the Crowns of Gold and other Presents which had been made him by the several Cities He sent the Mony to  Sparta  in sealed Bags by  Gylippus  who ripping up the bottom of the Bags took out as much as he thought fit and then sew'd them up again But there happen'd to be a Note in each Bag specifying the Sum contain'd in it which  Gylippus  not being appris'd of the Fraud by this means was detected And thereupon either to avoid Punishment or out of Shame for having been guilty of so mean an Action he banish'd himself and never afterwards appear'd in  Sparta  There was a further Consideration in regard to this Treasure whether according to the  Spartan  Laws it ought to be received into the City Many of the soberest and most discreet among them oppos'd the introducing it and they were the more confirmed in their Opinion from this Instance of  Gylippus  who they found had been so far influenc'd by Mony as to give up every thing else for it and to sully all the Glory of his past Actions For he was otherwise a Man of great Reputation and had acquitted himself extremely well in the War of  Sicily  where he had the Command of the  Spartan  Troops And it was owing chiefly to him that the  Athenians  did  not make themselves Masters of that Island Hereupon the  Ephori  were obliged to pass a Decree that none but the old Iron Mony of the Country should be made current But  Lysander  's Friends would not yet give it up They resumed the Debate and got the Decree revers'd or at least so far qualified that this Mony tho' it was to be admitted into the City was to be employ'd only on publick Occasions and it was made capital to convert it to any private use But this did not answer the Intent of  Lycurgus  which was by prohibiting the use of Gold and Silver to restrain Covetousness and Luxury  Plutarch  observes upon this occasion That the ill Consequence of Riches was not so effectually prevented by forbidding the use of Mony in private as it was encouraged by allowing it in publick That therefore this sort of Prohibition only heighten'd their Desires and that if their Actions did not presently break out at least thei  Affections were tainted Whatever was pretended of laying in a Fund to supply the Exigencie of the State the use of Mony had now got footing among them they began to know the Valu  of it as well as their Neighbours and rais'd  by more arbitrary and oppressive Methods  Di  dorus Siculus  says They exacted Tribute fro  all the Cities under their Jurisdiction and tre  sur'd up a thousand Talents every Year Upo  the whole it is certain that the introducing th  Treasure was in effect a Change in the Constintion  it soften'd their Minds so as to prepare them for Corruption and in short was the first great Step towards their throwing off that rugged Virtue which distinguish'd them so much from the rest of  Greece  This Change was owing intirely to  Lysander  who sacrificed every thing to his Ostentation and Vanity and stuck at no Expence to gratify them He erected his own and several of the chief Commanders Statues in Brass He was very liberal to those of his Retinue and gave such Encouragement to the Poets that they complimented him with Songs of Triumph and employ'd all their Art in his Praises The  Grecians  in general were so aw'd with his Merit that they erected Altars to his Honour and sacrificed to him as a God  In the mean time while  The Thirty  in  Athens  The Proceedings of  The Thirty  instead of compiling and publishing a more perfect Body of Laws which was the Pretence  or their being chosen began to exert their Power of Life and Death And tho' they constituted  a Senate and other Magistrates they made no further use of them than to confirm their Authority and to see their Commands executed However they at first acted cautiously and condemn'd only the most detested and scandalous part of the Citizens such as lived by Eviden  ing and Informing But this was only to give a colour to their Proceedings their Design was to make themselves absolute and knowing that was not to be done without a Foreign Power  their next Step was to desire a Guard might be sent them from  Sparta  till such time as they could clear the City of all disaffected Persons and throughly settle the Government  Lysander  accordingly procured them a Guard under the Command of  Callibius  whom by Bribes and Artifices they work'd over to their Designs and then acted without Controul filling the City with the Blood of those who on account of their Riches Interest or good Qualities were most likely to make head against them The most violent among them was  Critias  who resolved to reek his Revenge on the People by whom he had formerly been banished  Theramenes  protests against them  The first who protested against these Proceedings was  Theramenes  one of their own Memhers And lest he should joi  with the Multitude against them they investe  three thousand of the Citizens with some part o  the Power and by their Assistance disarmed th  rest Being throughly embolden'd by such a  Accession to their Party they agreed to singl  out every one his Man to put them to death and seize their Estates for the Maintenance o  their Garrison Amongst whom was  Nicerat  the Son of  Nicias  a Man of the greatest Esta  and Interest in  Athens  and of so sweet and ob  liging a Temper that he was universally l  mented But being still jealous of  Theramene  who was struck with Horror at their Proposal they found it necessary to remove him out of t  way  Is accused by  Critias  And thereupon  Critias  accused him to  Senate of endeavouring to subvert the Government From thence he took occasion to justify their Proceedings in general as  That it was necessary to abridge the People in some measure of that Liberty with which they had so long been pamper'd That all Changes of Government were attended with Blood and therefore it was no wonder that they had so many Enemies But that it was unpardonable in one of their own Order to desert them and to betray that Power which by accepting a Share of it he had promised to maintain Theramenes  made so full and handsom a Defence that the Senate were inclined to favour him Which  Critias  perceiving and knowing that as one of  The Three Thousand  he had a Privilege of being tried in form he struck his Name out of the List in order to subject him more immediately to their Censure It was justly urged by  Theramenes That it was as easy to blot out any other Man's Name as his and that therefore they ought to make his Case their own  But as they were under no present Apprehension of that kind or rather that they were aw'd by a Guard which  Critias  had placed before the Bar of the Court they durst not oppose the Tyrants who taking advantage of their Silence  Is condemn'd and executed  immediately pass'd Sentence of Death upon him which he suffer'd by the Juice of  Hemlock  When he had drank his Dose he threw away what was left in the Cup and said  This to honest  Critias  Socrates  whose Disciple he had been was the only one  of the Senate who ventur'd to appear in his Defence he made an Attempt to rescue him out of the Hands of the Officer of Justice and after his Execution went about as it were in defiance of  The Thirty  exhorting and animating the Senators and Citizens against them  Critias  who had likewise been his Scholar was so alarm'd and incens'd at his Behaviour that he forba  him instructing the Youth But he went o  with the same Intrepidity and without any regard to his Authority The Tyrants whethe  they were aw'd with his Merit or his Resolution did not think fit to proceed against him  But as he continued to use the same Freedom with the Government it soon after cost him his Life as in its proper Place will be more particularly related As to  Theramenes  the People express'd a greater Concern for him than could have been expected for one of that Society But he was indeed the only one among them from whom they had any thing to hope for as a Barrier between them and the Tyranny When he first engaged with them he was upon the strictest Terms of Friendship with  Critias  and they had always acted together in concert But when he sound what Measures the other was pursuing he oppos'd him and broke with him  He had appear'd in most of the late Contests betwixt the Nobility and the Commons  His Character  and was active but not violent endeavouring rather to accommodate himself to both Parties than to  depress eithr From whence his Enemies gave him the Name of  The Buskin  as it serves either Foot But his shifting Sides proceeded not so much from the Unevenness of his Temper as from his Caution and Moderation which made him distinguish betwixt the Rule and the Tyranny He had some time before shewn his Inclination to an  Oligarchy  having been principally concerned with  Pisander  and  Antiphon  in introducing the Government of  The Four Hundred  And in this latter Instance he seems to have had some Plan of that kind in his view For he thought  The Thirty  too few to carry on the Administration and propos'd the adding some competent number to them On the other hand he was as much against the letting in  The Three Thousand  which he saw was only arming one part of the Citizens against the rest He was according to the mildness of his Nature for some middle Scheme whereby the Power of the Multitude might be restrain'd but not totally abolished But whatever his Designs were he had not weight enough to put them in execution and therefore sell a Sacrifice to the honesty of his Intentions The greatest Blot upon his Memory is his being instrumental in the Condemnation of the Admirals after the Fight at  Arginusae  The Tyrants having remov'd this Obstacle out of their way renew'd their Outrages with more Security taking off all whom they thought  any way obnoxious or in any capacity of ob  structing their Designs Whilst they were thu  destroying with Sword and Rapine the wretched Remainder of the Citizens cast their Thought on  Alcibiades  and were struck with Remorse for their last ill Usage of him But as he had before overlook'd their Peevishness and reliev'd them in their Extremities so neither were they now without hopes that he might appear again to rescue them And the Tyrants themselves were so apprehensive of it that they were very solicitous to get Intelligence of all his Designs and Actions  Critias  at last represented to  Lysander  that either the Government or  Alcibiades  must fall and after many Solicitations so far prevail'd that Orders were given to dispatch him He resided at that time in a small Village in  Phrygia  where he was making an Interest with  Pharnabazus  to recommend him to his Master  Artaxerxes Lysander  made it a Request to  Pharnabazus  to deliver him up either alive or dead and laid such stress upon it that he seem'd to make it a Condition of the League between the  Spartans  and the  Persians  He consented to it and committed the Execution to his Brother and his Uncle who surrounding the House where he dwelt with his Mistress  Timandra  set fire to it  Alcibiades  threw in great quantities of Clothes and Furniture to choke the Flame then with his Robe on his left Arm and his Sword in the other hand he made his way through it  Which the Assassins perceiving  Alcibiades  murther'd  retreated and slew him at a distance with their Darts and Arrows Some ascribe this Murther to  Pharnabazus  his own private Jealousy of him others to the Resentment of some young Noblemen whose Sister he had debauch'd And others say he had got into the Secret of the Levy that  Cyrus  was making for the Expedition against his Brother and was endeavouring by the Discovery of it to  Artaxerxes  to ingratiate himself with that Prince and to procure his Assistance for reestabling the Affairs of his Country that therefore it became necessary to take him off But whatever Cause they assign for his Death they are generally agreed as to the manner of it which indeed was suitable to that Extravagance  His Character  with which Fortune had all along treated him And therein she did but second the variety of Nature who seems in his Composition to have work'd up the most jarring Contradictions and to have tried how far she could go in reconciling the Extremes of Vice and Virtue But it is to be doubted whether his Virtues ought upon a strict Examination to bear that Name and whether they ought not rather to be call'd extraordinary Talents and Endowments and Ways of recommending himself They had more of Artifice and Design of Popularity and Ostentation than of any real Principle of Honour and justice or Love of his Country And therefore  Valcrius Maximus  makes it a question Whether his good  or bad Qualities were most hurtful to the Publick  By the former  says he  he deceived his FellowCitizens and by the latter he ruin'd them  H  first insinuated himself into their Confidence and then put them upon fruitless and desperat  Projects particularly that fatal Expedition against  Sicily  where their Fleets and Armies moulder'd away when they had need enough of them a  home and this paved the way for their tota  Overthrow by  Lysander  His View in these Enterprises was not only to procure Honour to himself but also to make himself necessary and to keep the People employ'd so that they should not be at leisure to inquire into his Conduct He likewise found his account in the Presents that were made him abroad and in that respect he was both greedy and corrupt and yet his taking them was not so much for the sake of the Mony as to support his Popularity and Luxury His natural bent was certainly Pleasure and yet as much as he lov'd it he made it give way to his Ambition But he was so violent and withal so irregular and capricious in the Pursuit of it that there was no living with him upon any equal sooting He was any thing and every thing by fits and starts and just as it suited his present purpose one while for the  Oligarchy  and then as great a Stickler for the  Democracy  one while in the  Spartan  Interest in order to revenge himself of his Country and then in the  Persian  in order to be reconcil'd to it The  People it must be confes'd were no less unequal and inconstant in their behaviour to him from whence it happen'd that according to the Temper they were in or according to the occasion they had for his Service he was look'd upon as the best or worst Member of the Commonwealth and was either caress'd and ador'd or detested and persecuted And yet upon the whole they had such an opinion of his Merit that tho' they were never easy with him they never thought themselves safe without him  Plutarch  makes a Remark That his Enemies could never get the better of him but in his Absence which must be attributed to his Subtilty and Address and more especially to the Amiableness of his Person and the Force of his Eloquence which  Nepos  says No body could resist But tho' by these means he captivated the generality of the Citizens yet the gravest and most considerable among them saw further into the Disguise and were more upon their guard against him Upon this occasion the Warning that was given them by  Timon  the  Manhater  of what they were to expect from him may be worth remembring It happen'd one Day that  Alcibiades  having succeeded well in an Oration the whole Assembly attended to compliment him upon it and  Timon  instead of avoiding him as he did others in the like Cases put himself in his way and taking him by the Hand said  Go on boldly my Son may'st thou increase in Credit  with the People for thou wilt one Day bring them Calamities enough  He was scarce above forty Years old when he died by which time he had done enough to make himself by turns the Support and Terror not only of his own Country but of several other Parts both in  Greece  and  Asia  And he had been still greater if he had been as careful to preserve the People's Love as he was to obtain it But the Management of Prosperity was not his Talent And therefore the fairest View of him is to be taken from his Sufferings which as they were often unjust set off his good Qualities to a greater Advantage and consequently made his Fall the more lamented especially at a time when he was so much wanted Having given a general Character of this great Man when I first mention'd him I have here only added such further Observations as were necessary to illustrate it and which have naturally occur'd upon a more distinct Survey of his Actions  The Inhabitants not being able to bear the severe Treatment they met with from  The Thirty  fled daily in great numbers out of the City by which means all  Greece  was overspread with  Athenian  Exiles till at last the  Spartans  published an Edict forbidding any of their Cities to receive them so that they were forced to betake themselves to  Thebes  and  Argos  and such other Places where they could live in any tolerable Security  The first who appear'd to stem this Torrent  Thrasybulus  opposes  The Thirty  was  Thrasybulus  who had done good Service in the  Peloponnesian  War insomuch that  Alcibiades  is said to owe most of his Success to his acting in concert with him But his Merit being not of so glaring a kind was in a great measure eclips'd by that General till it broke out upon this occasion of exerting himself alone and in such a Cause as the Subversion of Tyranny At  Thebes  he fell into a Consultation with his FellowCitizens and the Result was That some vigorous Effort tho' it carried never so much Danger with it ought to be made for the Recovery of the publick Liberty Accodingly with a Party of Thirty Men only as  Nepos  says but as  Xenophon  more probably says of near Seventy he seized upon  Phyle  a strong Castle on the Frontiers of  Attica  This Enterprise gave the Alarm to  The Tyrants  who immediately march'd out of the City with  The Three Thousand  and their  Spartan  Guard and attempted the Recovery of the Place but were repuls'd with loss Finding they could not carry it by a sudden Assault they resolved upon a Siege but being not sufficiently provided for that Service and a great Snow falling that Night they were forced to retire the next Day into the City leaving only part of their Guard to prevent any further Excursions into the Country  By this first Success  Thrasybulus  had increas'd his Followers to the number of Seven hundred  His Success  with which he made a Sally upon the Guards and dispers'd and routed them with the Slaughter of about an hundred and twenty  The Thirty  in the mean while were under great Consternation and for sear of Treachery from those few who were left in the City they forced them to quit it Then they fortified  Eleusis  to serve them upon any sudden Exigency as a Place of Retreat And to free themselves from any Jealousy the Inhabitants might give them they caused all who were able to bear Arms to pass One by One as it were upon a Review in order to compute the Strength of the Garrison and murder'd them At the same time they attempted to corrupt  Thrasybulus  and sent under colour of treating about Prisoners to make him a private Offer of sharing with them in the Government together with the Liberty of restoring any Ten of the Exiles whom he should name upon Condition he would dismiss the rest and come into their Measures To which Proposal he generously answer'd  That he look'd upon his Banishment to be far more honourable than the whole Power and Dominion of  The Thirty  and that be would never put up his Sword till all the Citizens from every Part were receiv'd and restor'd to the Liberties derived to them from their Ancestors  By this time he had got together a Body of a thousand Men with which he march'd out of  Phyle  by Night and seiz'd on the  Piraeus The Thirty  coming with their whole Strength to the Relief of it he took advantage of the Ground' made the best Disposition of his Men then reminded them of the Cause they were engaged in and the Success they had hitherto met with and offer'd the Enemy Battle wherein he easily obtain'd the Victory which indeed was more remarkable for the Consequence of it than the Number of the Slain wich were about Seventy but among them were  Critias  and  Hippomacbus  two of the chief of the Tyrants  A Truce being granted for delivering up the dead Bodies both Sides came to a Parley and  Thrasybulus  took that occasion to expostalate with them asking them  Why they fled from a Conqueror whom they ought rather to join as the Assertor of the Publick Liberty  adding  That his Army was compos'd of Citizens and not of Enemies that he came not to rob or plunder  than but to restore them to their own  in short  That his Quarrel was to the Tyrants not to the City  Then he reminded them  How they were tied to one another by all the Obligations of Religion Laws and Consanguinity how they had served in the same Camp and sought under the same Colours  He conjur'd them  That if they themselves could pa  iently submit to the Yoke they would at least have  ome Pity for their FellowCitizens who were ba  ished for no other Reason but because they would  ot be Slaves  concluding  That if they would restore  him to his Country he would restore them to  their Liberty  It is probable this Speech may be  consounded with another to the same effect by some ascribed to  Cleocritus  but it is certain i  made such an Impression upon  The Three Thou sand  especially those who had been least instru  mental in these Outrages that upon their Re  turn into the City they became throughly sensible that they ought not to let their Country b  ruin'd to support the Avarice and Ambition o  their Tyrants  The Thirty  reinov'd  The Issue whereof was that  Th  Thirty  should be remov'd from the Government Accordingly they retired to  Eleusis  and te  others were chosen  Ten subsittuted in their room  Olym    one out of each Tribe fo  the Administration  But this Change was far from producing an  good effect  They follow the Example of  The Thirty  The Ten  copied exactly after  The Thirty  so that the Tyranny being restrain'd only as t  the Number there were the same Jealousies Tumults and Divisions in the City the same Act  of Injustice Rapine and Cruelty And many o  The Three Thousand  were too deeply involved i  the Guilt of the former Administration not t  pursue the same Measures They found ther  was no means of Sasety or Impunity lest so  them but by the utter Destruction of those i  the  Piraeus  Accordingly they held Correspondence with  The Thirty  at  Eleusis  and made the  joint Application to  Sparta  for fresh Succours so  that purpose Their Request was seconded b  L  sander  who represented it as a new Affront o  fer'd to the  Spartans  in revolting from them and dissolving the Form of Government which they had prescribed to them and thereupon he procured them from the State an hundred Talents  Lysander  sent to support them  with a Commission for himself to go General and his Brother  Libys  Admiral in order to block up the  Piraeus  by Sea and Land Accordingly he march'd with a strong Body of  Peloponnesians  and the Admiral suffer'd no Provisions to go in by Sea by which means those in the  Piraeus  were distress'd on all sides  While things were in this Posture  Pausanias  sent after him  Pausanias  one of the  Spartan  Kings got leave to follow  Lysander  with another Body to support him But his Design was not so much to assist as to watch him he could not allow him the Glory of conquering  Athens  a second time and therefore went rather to trifle and perplex the War than to prosecute it to any real Advantage So that what some call his Commiseration of the poor  Athenians  was in reality the Envy he bore to  Lysander  It is also observable that in making his Levies for this Expedition out of the Forces in Alliance with  Spar  a  the  Boeotians  and  Corinthians  who had all along been the most active and profess'd Enemies of the  Athenians  resused now to serve against them alledging that They could not salve their Oath in making War upon those who had not broke any one Article of the League But the truth is they apprehended the Power of the  Spartans  concluding  They would make an entire Conquest of  Athens  and annex it to their own Dominions This is the first Instance of that Jealousy which soon after several other States of  Greece  conceived of  Sparta  Pausanias  before any Act of Hostility on his side sent to those in the  Piraeus  to depart every one to his respective home and upon their Refusal having drawn up his Men and made a slight Attack he went to view the Ground for opening the Trenches But the Enemy made a Sally and gall'd him so in his Retreat that from Skirmishing he was forc'd to bring it to a regular Action which was fought obstinately enough on both sides till at length the  Athenians  were routed  Routs  the Athenians  with the loss of an hundred and fifty Men and  Pausanias  erected a Trophy  But instead of pushing his Victory he sent privately to the  Athenians  that they should dispatch Ambassadors to him and the two  Ephori  who attended him in the Field to offer Terms of Accommodation Accordingly they sent their Deputies both from the  Piraeus  and the City and a Peace was concluded upon these Conditions  That every Man should return home except  The Thirty  and  The Ten  and Eleven mort who had commanded in the  Piraeus  And if any in the City apprehended themselves to be obnoxious they should also be free to retire with them to  Eleusis After which  Pausanias  drew off the  Spartan  Army and those in the  Piraeus  march'd with their Arms into the City where  Thrasybulus  having among other things reproach'd the Citizens with their calling the  Spartans  in to their Assistance told them  They had nothing further to fear provided they would be governed by their ancient Laws  The Democracy  restored  and so far prevail'd upon them that they chose their Magistrates as formerly and restored the  Democracy  But the City had no sooner began to recover Breath when the Remainder of the Faction at  Eleusis  were hiring Foreign Troops in order to make another Attempt Whereupon the whole City went out against them and having taken their Commanders upon a Pretence of coming to a Parley cut them to pieces after which the rest were easily brought to an Accommodation And lest the Remembrance of former Transactions should create any new Disturbances a General  Amnesty  was pass'd  A general Amnesly  and every Man obliged himself by Oath to bury what was pass'd in Oblivion Which being religiously observed the City was restored to its former Tranquillity and its Members were again united into one Body  Thus ended this Sedition in the third after its breaking out upon the Change of the Government  Olymp    during which time the State suffer'd such Convulsions as proved more fatal to it than the War There were fourteen hundred Citizens put to death without hearing and those  chiefly Men of Note and Condition There were above Five Thousand more forced to fly into the  Piraeus  And  Xenophon  observes that this  stine Fury had consumed as many in eight Months as the  Peloponnesian  War did in Ten Years As the Flame was kindled by the Tyranny of  The Thirty  so it was all along fomented and kept alive by the Ambition of  Lysander  And that it was at last extinguished is almost intirely owing to the Conduct and Resolution of  Thrasybulus  who after the share he had in rescuing his Country from a Foreign Enemy had the peculiar Glory of suppressing its intestine Foes and by that means of restoring the City to itself And in effecting this he shew'd the greatest Temper and Moderation which indeed were necessary in such a Conjuncture to appease the Minds of the People and to reconcile them to one another Hence it was that this  Act  of  Oblivion  became a Pattern to succeeding Ages and  Cicero  recommends it as such to the People of  Rome  when the City was divided into Factions upon the Murther of  Julius Caesar  Upon this Reestablishment of Affairs in  Athens  the other States enjoyed the same Tranquillity or rather kept in a quiet Subjection to  Sparta  which now held the undoubted Sovereignty of  Greece  But it being a Maxim with the  Spartans  that this Sovereignty was not to be maintain'd but by a constant course of Action they were still seeking fresh Occasions of War And  part of their Forces together with another Body of  Grecians  being at this time engaged in a Quarrel between the  Persian  King and his Brother it will be necessary to pass over into  Asia  and relate so much of the  Persian  Affairs as concerns  The Expedition of  Cyrus wherein those Forces were employ'd especially since it is attended with Circumstances which if duly consider'd will easily make it pass for one of the greatest Actions of Antiquity  Darius  the  Persian  upon his Deathbed  Olymp  for his two Sons  Artaxerxes  and  Cyrus  the former whereof he declared his Successor  Grounds of the Expedition of Cyrus  and the other General of a part of his Troops and he had before appointed him Commander in chief of the Maritime Provinces The old King being dead  Tissaphernes  who went up with  Cyrus  from his Government accused him to his Brother of Treason But upon the Intercession of his Mother  Parisatis  not only his Life was spared but he was confirmed in his Government And yet he was no sooner returned to it but he studied how to revenge this Affront and to dethrone his Brother To this end he practised with the  Grecians  and  Barbarians  and made Levies of the best Soldiers of  Peloponnesus  in order to recruit his Garrisons the Pretence for which was his Distrust of  Tissaphernes  from whom he had taken all the Cities of  Ionia  except  Miletus  and that he had block'd up by Sea and Land under colour of restoring some  whom  Tissaphernes  had banished upon a Suspicion of their betraying him The King was not much concerned at his Quarrel with  Tissaphernes  so long as he thought these Levies were designed against him only and he was the more confirmed in this Opinion because  Cyrus  continued to send him up the Tribute due from those Places as before  Cyrus  in the mean while held Intelligence with  Clearchus Aristippus  and other  Grecians  who were either banish'd from their respective Countries  His making Levies  or disgusted in them and by their means got together upon several different Pretences One little Army in the  Chersonese  of  Thrace  a Second upon the  Hellespont  and a Third in  Thessaly  When his Designs were ripe he drain'd his Garrisons and assembled all these scatter'd Forces together at  Sardis  giving out that his Intent was to chastise the  Pisidians  who infested his Province  His Pretence for it  But  Tissaphernes  judging right that these Preparations were too great for so inconsiderable an Enterprise as the  Pisidian  War ha  en'd to inform the King of it who accordingly took the Alarm and prepared for his Defence  At the Rendezvous of the Forces at  Sardis  The Rende  of his For  at Sa  ci  there were Four Thousand  Grecians  who had been drawn out of the Garrisons under the Command of  Xenias Proxenus  the  Boeotian  had brought Two Thousand more  Sophaenetus  the  Stymphalian  One Thousand  Socrates  of  Achaia  Five hundred and  Phasion  the  Megarean  Seven Hundred in all to the number of Eight Thousand Two Hundred Men with which  Cyrus  march'd through  Lydia  to  Colossus  a City of  Phrygia  where he was join'd by  Menon  the  Thessalian  who commanded in the room of  Aristippus  with Fifteen Hundred more His next March was to  Celaene  another City of  P  rygia  where  Clearchus  the  Spartan  came in to him with Two Thousand more  Sosias  the  Syracusian  with One Thousand and  Socrates  the  Arcadian  with Three Hundred which made the whole Number of  Grecians  Thirteen Thousand whereof Eleven Thousand were heavyarm'd  But when they were got as far as  Tarsus  the Capital of  Cilicia  The Grecians refuse to follow him  they began to perceive  Cyrus  's Intent of leading them into  Persia  against his Brother and refused to follow him till by the Artifice of  Clearchus  who was the only  Grecian  in the Secret of  Cyrus  's Design they being convinced it was less hazardous to proceed than to retreat  But are prevailed upon by  Clearchus  began to be pacified and upon a Promise of having their Pay augmented to a Third more they agreed to march At  Issus  he last City of  Cilicia  there came to them Thir  y Five  Peloponnesian  Gallies and Twenty Five of  Cyrus  's which had been employ'd in the Blockade of  Miletus  and  Cherisophus  the  Spar  an  join'd the Army with Seven Hundred  Greians  which he had on board the Gallies Four Hundred more who were in the Pay of  Abrocomas  deserted from him and came in to  Cyrus  This  Abrocomas  commanded upon the  Euphrates  and march'd with Three Hundred Thousand Men to join the King's Army but did not arrive till after the Battle  When they were arrived upon the Coasts of  Phaenicia  Xenias  and  sion de  Xenias  and  Phasion  deserted from them and made their Escape on board a Merchant Ship which  Cyrus  did not resent in such a manner as was expected He only told the other Captains  That no body should reproach him with keeping them in his Service against their Will or with taking from them what they had got in it that it was in his Power to pursue and punish them but that he was so far from doing either that he would send to them their Wives and Children which be had as Hostages  By this generous Proceeding he fix'd the Resolution of those who before had no great Inclination to proceed  When they came to  Thapsacus  a City upon the  Euphrates Cyrus  told them plainly his Design of marching against the King at which the Soldiers murmur'd  The  Greciansagain  refuse to march  and reproach'd their Officers with having kept it so long secret refusing at the same time to march any further till  Cyrus  promis'd them a further Reward upon their Arrival at  Babylon  But are again prevail'd upon  together with their full Pay to their Return into  Ionia Menon  was also very instrumental in persuading them for which  Cyrus  made him Presents to a considerable value  From thence they march'd through  Mesopotamia  and at last advanc'd into the Province of  Bablyon  where  Cyrus  upon the Return of those who had been sent to reconnoitre the Enemy advis'd with the  Grecian  Captains and then spoke to them to this effect  It is not my Friends  Cyrus's  Speech to the  Grecian  Captains  for want of Troops that I have made choice of you but because I have thought you were better to me than a great Number of  Barbarians  Don't let me be deceived in my Opinion of you but shew your selves worthy of that Liberty which you enjoy and which I think preferable to all other Possessions Consider only who you have to do with and nothing can happen in the Engagement to dishearten you The Enemy indeed is very numerous and will rush upon you with great Shouts and Acclamations but if you can stand this first Eclat you your selves will be ashamed for them afterwards If you behave upon this Occasion like your selves and any one shall afterwards desire to return home his Countrymen shall have cause to look upon him with Admiration and Envy But many of you I believe will rather choose to stay with me and accept the Offers that shall be made you  There was a certain  Samian  who took the Liberty of telling the Prince  That his promises were very large in proportion to the Danger of his Enterprise but that after the Battle he would forget them or that if he did not he would not have it in his Power to perform them  To which  Cyrus  replied  This Kingdom of my Father's is so extensive that one  part of it is not habitable by reason of the Heat nor the other by reason of the Cold All that lies between these Two Extremes it will be in my Power if I am victorious to bestow on my Friends Neither am I so much afraid of not having enough to give as of not having Men enough to give it to And as for you  Grecians  I promise to give every Man of you a Crown of Gold  Upon which Assurances they went away very well satisfied  Clearchus  afterwards ask'd him if he thought the King would give him Battle  Yes undoubtedly  said he  If he be the Son of  Darius  and  Parisatis  and my Brother he will not let me take possession of all this without striking a Stroke for it  Upon a general Review of his Army  He  reviews his Army  he found it composed of Ten Thousand and Four Hundred heavyarm'd  Grecians  Two Thousand Five Hundred others and an Hundred Thousand of other Nations and the Enemy by the Accounts they had from Deserters amounted to Twelve Hundred Thousand Men besides a select Body of Six Thousand Horse He then form'd his Army  And forms it  giving to  Clearchus  the Command of the right Wing of  Grecians  and  Menon  the lest and march'd in order of Battle expecting every Hour to engage But the Enemy having left a Pass open to him which he thought they would have disputed he pursued his March with more Security and less Order till at last being arrived at the Place where he intended to encamp he discover'd the King's  Army by a thick Cloud of Dust and prepar'd to receive them He order'd  Clearchus  to charge directly into the Center where the King was for that thereupon depended the whole Success of the Battle But the Enemy being so numerous that one of their Wings would cover the whole Front of  Cyrus's  Army he thought it not adviseable to abandon the River for sear of being surrounded by them which  Plutarch  blames him for as having left that Service to  Cyrus  and thereby occasion'd his Death When he had let the Enemy advance within four or five hundred Paces of him the  Grecians  began the Hymn to Battle  The Battle  and march'd up to them with great Acclamations But before they were got within reach of their Javelins the  Barbarians  fled and the  Grecians  after them calling out to one another not to break their Ranks in the Pursuit  Cyrus  perceiv'd the  Grecians  were victorious yet was not transported with it tho' he was already saluted King by those about him At length he discover'd the King his brother in the midst of the Battle and for fear he should fall upon the  Grecians  in their Pursuit and cut them off he made up directly to him with Six Hundred Horse and with his own Hand kill'd  Artagerses  who commanded the King's Six Thousand Horse But when he had broke their Squadrons all his own People abandon'd him except a few of his Domesticks with whom he charg'd on to the King and crying out  I see him  threw a Javelin  at him and wounded him in the Stomach but at the same time receiv'd a Wound himself under his Eye  Cyrus kill'd  and was kill'd upon the Spot with eight of his principal Attendants The King order's his Head and right Hand to be cut off and then push'd on to  Cyrus's  Camp in pursuit of  Ariaeus  who commanded his Horse and had fled as soon as he had heard of his Master's Death The  Grecians  at the same time were in pursuit of one part of the King's Army whils  the other part of it were plundering their Camp so that both sides thought themselves victorious The King return'd upon them in the same Order of Battle as at first but the  Barbarians  fled again on all sides upon the Approach of the  Grecians  who being very much fatigued and Night drawing on returned to their Camp not knowing what was become of  Cyrus  but expecting his Orders the next Day to compleat their Victory When the News arrived to them the next Morning of  Cyrus's  Death it occasion'd a  general Consternation and they were now to deliberate not so much to annoy the Enemy a  to provide for their own Safety  This was the Success of the Battle which wa  fought at  Cunaxa  in  Assyria  on the Banks o  the River  Euphrates  about an hundred League from  Babylon  And thus sell  Cyrus  in the pur  suit of his Ambition which yet was attende  with so many good Qualities that he deserved better Fate and it is very probable from th  Circumstances of the Action that if he had been more cautious in exposing himself he had carried his Point The Character of this Prince is finely drawn by  Xenophon  But not to enter further into the  Persian  Affairs than is necessary to my present Purpose I will only observe of him in general from that Historian that no body of his time whether  Grecian  or  Barbarian  was so universally beloved He describes him further as a Prince born for Empire and the most worthy Successor of  Cyrus the Great  Amidst the Confusion the  Grecians  were in after the Battle they sent to  Ari  us  as Conqueror and Commander in chief upon  Cyrus's  Death to offer him the  Persian  Crown In the mean time the King as Conqueror also on his side sent to them to surrender their Arms  The Grecians  summon'd to surrender their Arms  and implore his Mercy representing to them at the same time That as they were in the Heart of his Dominions surrounded with vast Rivers and numberless Nations it would be impossible for them to escape his Vengeance and therefore they had nothing to do but to submit to the present Necessity Upon debating among themselves what Answer they should return  Proxenus  desired to know of the Heralds  But they refuse  upon what Terms the King demanded their Arms  If as Conqueror it was in his Power to take them if upon any other foot what would be give them in return  He was seconded by  Xenophon  who said  They had nothing left but their Arms and their Liberty  and that they could not preserve the one without the other Clearchus  said to the same effect  That if the King was disposed to be their Friend they should be in a better Capacity of serving him with Arms than without if their Enemy they should have need of them for their Defence  Some indeed spoke in Terms more complying  That as they had served  Cyrus  faithfully they would also serve  Artaxerxes  if he would employ them and provided he would at the same time put them in possession of  Aegypt At last it was agreed that they should remain in the Place where they were and that if they advanced further or retreated back it should be look'd upon as a Declaration of War so that by the Issue of the Debate it appear'd to have been managed so as to avoid giving a direct Answer but only to amuse the King and gain time  Whilst this Treaty was on foot they received  Ariaeus's  Answer That there were too many powerful Men in  P  rsia  to let him possess the Throne wheresore he intended to set out early the next Morning in his Return towards  Greece  and that if they had a mind to accompany him  they should join him that Night in his Camp  Which accordingly they all did  Milthocytus  goes in to the Persian King with Horse The rest decamp the next Day  except  Milithocy  tus  a  Thracian  who went with a Party of Thre  Hundred Men and Forty Horse to the King The rest in conjunction with  Ariaeus's  Forces decamp'd by break of Day and continu'd then March till Sunset when they discovered from  the neighbouring Villages the King was in pursuit of them But this Alarm was over the next Day when he sent to treat with them  Clearchus  return'd Answer  That his Men were straiten'd for want of Provisions and that his Affairs required him rather to fight than to enter upon a Treaty  Wherefore the King to prevent their being desperate sent to conduct them to several Villages where they found plenty of every thing and after Three Days Stay there  Tissaphernes  came and insinuated to them the good Offices he had employ'd with the King to give him leave to conduct them safe into their Country that in return they ought to acknowledge this Favour and not shew themselves averse to such Terms as he could obtain for them  Clearchus  urg'd in their Defence That they had been engag'd in this Expedition by  Cyrus  without their Knowledge or Intention that upon his Death they were now free'd from that Engagement and had no Design upon  Artaxerxes  or his Country provided he did not oppose them in their Return Which  Tissaphernes  agree'd to on the King's part that he should not and promis'd further That they should be furnish'd with all necessary Provisions in their March and that he himself would return with them to his Government  Accordingly in a few Days after they set out ander his Conduct But in their March the  Barbarians  encamping at about a League's distance  from the  Grecians  created some little Distrusts and Jealousies on both sides In about fifty Days being got to the Banks of the River  Zabatus Clearchus  to prevent things coming to an open Rupture had a Conference with  Tissaphernes  wherein among other things he assur'd him of their Fidelity in regard to the Truce between them as likewise of their future Service whenever he should have occasion to employ them and that they would always look upon him as the Author of their Safety and Deliverance  The Treachery of  Tissaphernes  To which  Tissaphernes  answer'd That he was glad of this occasion of coming to a right Understanding with him That indeed it was in their Power to have destroy'd the  Grecia  whenever they had pleas'd but that he himself had prevented it out of a Desire to oblige them by his good Offices as  Cyrus  had done by hi  Mony The Result of their Discourse was That they had been misrepresented to each other by some of  Clearchus  his Officers and that h  should bring them all to  Tissaphernes  in order to  detect those who were guilty He particularly suspected  Menon  of a Design to supplant him  his Command and accordingly brought hi  the next Day with three other General Office  Proxenus Agias  and  Socrates  attended with  Guard of Twenty Captains and about Two Hundred Soldiers upon a Pretence of buying Provisions in the  Persian  Camp The Five G  neral Officers upon a Signal given were imm  diately admited into  Tissaphernes  's Tent and put in Arrest the others who were without were at the same time cut in pieces and some  Persian  Horse scouring the Plain kill'd all the  Grecians  they met Amidst this Scene of Slaughter and Confusion the  Persians  sent to them a second time in the King's Name to lay down their Arms pretending that  Clearchus  was executed as having been accused by  Proxenus  and  Menon  of perfidiously designing to break the Truce and that his Accusers were sent for to be rewarded by the King for their Discovery But  Xenophon  suspecting the Treachery demanded that  Proxenus  and  Menon  as being innocent and common Friends to both might be restored to them as the properest Persons to advise them in this Exigency To which the  Persians  not knowing what to reply went away Immediately after  Nicarchus  one of the Captains who had attended the Generals came wounded in the Belly and holding up his Entrails with his Hand to the  Grecian  Camp and told them all the Particulars of what had happen'd  The Five  Grecian  Generals executed  The five Generals were sent back to the King who caus'd them all to be beheaded except  Menon  who suffer'd some other way after a Year's Torture It does not appear why he was distinguished in this manner from the rest tho' indeed there was some Justice in it in regard to his Character which was as extraordinary as his Treatment  He was by Birth a  Thessalian  The Character of Menon  covetous and ambitious but who made his Ambition all along subservient to his Avarice and had no other View in his Pursuit of Honour but to get by it He sought the Friendship of Men in Power only to screen him from Punishment He concluded the readiest way to obtain his Ends was by Perjury Lying and Fraud and took Candor and Openness for Stupidity He loved no body and wherever he profess'd a Freindship it was in order to ensnare He did not laugh at his Enemies but always made a Jest of his Friends So neither did he attempt to defraud his Enemies of their Property as knowing they were too much upon their Guard against him But his Friends who were not so he fleec'd and plunder'd And he valued himself as much upon his Injustice and Falshood as others did upon their Religion and Virtue For he thought none but Cheats were to be look'd upon as Men of Address He made his way to Great Men by traducing their Favourites His manner of supporting his Authority among the Troops was by committing the same Crimes with them He endeavour'd to make himself fear'd by the Mischief he could do you and you were to take it as an Obligation that he did not do it when it was in his Power He gain'd the Favour of  Ariaeus  in his Youth by abandoning himself to his unnatural Passion and he prevail'd the same way with  Aristippus  for his Command in the  Army Some have imagin'd that he was pardon'd by  Artaxerxes  and conclude from thence that he was engag'd in a Design of betraying the  Grecians  to him which according to his Principles might easily be supposed But however this Account of him does not appear to be well founded  Clearchus  was a  Spartan  Of  Clearchu    and esteem'd one of the greatest Captains of his Time He had done good Servie to his Country in the  Peloponnesian  War and was intirely devoted to the Love of Arms insomuch that he laid out all his Mony in War and with the same Gust and Appetite with which others laid it out upon their Pleasures Hence it was that upon the Peace he desir'd leave to go and chastise the  Thracians  who had committed some Insults upon the  Chersonese  Soon after he was gone the  Ephori  changed their Minds and recall'd him and tho' they pas'd Sentence of Death upon him for disobeying their Orders he proceeded on his March beat the  Thracians  in a pitch'd Battle ravaged their Country and continued the War till he enter'd into  Cyrus's  Service where he was pitch'd upon as the properest Man to command the  Grecians  in this Expedition And he had Talents suitable to so hardy an Undertaking He was severe in his Looks and harsh in his Speech he always punish'd sharply and sometimes in Anger but generally with Discretion He was very strict in his Discipline and it was a Saying  of his  That a Soldier ought to be more afraid of his Officer than of his Enemy  Upon Action his Men desir'd no other General for he then appear'd mild to them and reserv'd all his Fierceness for the Enemy But when the Danger was over he resumed his Natural Roughness and many of them as they found opportunity left him None of them follow'd him out of Inclination but lived with him as Boys do with their Schoolmasters However he did every thing with them by dint of Punishment and the Sum of his Character is that he was more fit to command than to obey  Proxenus  was a  Boeotian  Of  Proxenus  and of an aspiring Temper which had engaged him in this Service tho' he did nothing in the Pursuit of his Ambition but what was consistent with Honour and Virtue He was capable enough of Command but was too much the Reverse of  Clearchus  He had not the way of making himself fear'd where it was necessary For he was more afraid of being ill with the Soldiery than the Soldiery with him He thought it sufficient to commend good Actions without punishing the bad For which reason he was beloved by those who acted upon Principles of Honour but bad Men took advantage of his Easiness  Agias  was an  Arcadian  Of  Agias  and  Socrates  and  Socrates  and  Achaean  they had both lived without Reproach either as to their Military or their Civil Conduct  The  Grecians  had ever since the Battle of  Cyrus  been so upon their guard and were withal so bold and resolute that the  Persians  despair'd of subduing them by open Force and therefore had recourse to this treacherous Stratagem which had so far succeeded that the Loss of the Generals was very near breaking and dispersing the whole Body The News of it struck them with the utmost Consternation They expected every Moment when they should be attacked in their Camp They consider'd that they were at the very Gates of the King surrounded with great Rivers in the midst of many Nations their Enemies six or seven hundred Leagues from  Greece  without Officers to lead them in want of all manner of Provisions and of Means to get any besides that they had no Cavalry and therefore if they were victorious could not pursue their Enemies and if they should happen to be defeated must every Man of them be cut off In these perplexing Thoughts they pass'd the Night without Sleep despairing ever to see their Native Country more  It was upon this Occasion  Xenophon  and others succeed in the Command  that  Xenophon  signalized himself He was an intimate Friend of  Proxenus  who had invited him into  Asia  and presented him to  Cyrus  who had also express'd a particular Esteem for him but hitherto he had served only as a Voluntier in the Army The next Morning he assembled the Officers and represented to them the Misery of their Condition  That they could expect no Mercy from the King if they fell into his Hands to prevent which they had nothing to depend upon but their own Personal Bravery and that no time ought to be lost in providing for their Defence He therefore advised to choose new Officers in the Place of those who were murther'd and to resolve to make their way home in the best manner they could Accordingly they chose  Timasion  in the room of  Clearchus Xanthicles  in that of  Socrates Cleanor  in that of  Agias Philesius  in that of  Menon  and  Xenophon  in that of his Friend  Proxenus  He having encourag'd the Army with a long Harangue in praise of their Ancestors propos'd to them for the Safety and Expedition of their Return to burn their Tents Carriages and all unnecessary Baggage and to march in the form of a hollow Square that in case they should be attack'd they might be prepar'd to receive the Enemy with a Front either way All which being approv'd of  Cherisophus  the  Spart  n  led the Van and  Timasion  and  Xenophon  brought up the Rear  They bent their March towards the Heads of the great Rivers  The  Grechians  pursue their March  in order to pass them where they were fordable But they had made very little way before they were follow'd by a Party of the Enemies Archers and Slingers commanded by  Mithridates  which gall'd their Rear and wounded several of them who being heavyarm'd and without Cavalry could make no  Resistance To prevent the like Inconvenience  Xenophon  furnish'd two hundred  Rhodians  with Slings and mounted fifty more of his Men upon BaggageHorses so that when  Mithridates  came up with them a second time and with a much greater Body  The  Barbarians  repuls'd by them  he repuls'd them with this Handful of Men till he arrived near to the City  Larissa  on the Banks of the  Tigris  From thence they march'd to another desolate City call'd  Mepsila  and about four Leagues from that Place  Tissaphernes  came up to them with his whole Army in Order of Battle but  fter several Skirmishes was forc'd to retire In a few Days after he secured an Eminence over which the  Grecians  were obliged to make their way Which  Xenophon  perceiving took a De  achment of the Army and with great Diligence gain'd the Top of a Mountain which commanded that Eminence from whence he easily dislodg'd the Enemy and made good a Passage for the rest of hsi Troops into the Plain where they found Plenty of Provisions tho'  Tis  aphernes  had done what he could before to  urn and destroy the Country  But still they were under as great Difficulties as ever being bounded on the one hand by the  Tigris  and on the other by inaccessible Mountains inhabited by the  Carduchi  a sierce and warlike People and who  Xenophon  says had cut off an Army of Six Score Thousand  Persians  to  a Man by reason of the Difficulty of the Ways However having no Boats to cross the River and the Passage through the Mountains opening into the rich Plains of  Armenia  they resolv'd to pursue their March that way These  Barbarians  soon took the Alarm but not being prepar'd to meet them in a Body they possess'd themselves of the Tops of the Rocks and Mountains and from thence annoy'd them with Darts and great Stones  They are attack'd by the  Carduchi  which they threw down into the Defiles thro' which they pass'd in which they were also attack'd by several other Parties and thoug  their Loss was not considerable yet what with Storms and Famine besides seven tedious Days March and being continually forc'd to fight their way they underwent more Fatigue and Hardship than they had suffer'd from the  Persians  during the whole Expedition  They were now got to the Banks of the  Centrites  which divides the Mountains from  Armenia  And whilst the  Carduchi  were still in View of them and pouring down upon their Backs they had this deep River before them with  Body of Troops on the other side to dispute their Passage Notwithstanding which they forded it with all their Baggage and fought their way into  Armenia  They fight their way  Armenia  where  Tyribazus  the Governor offer'd them free Passage and Provisions upon condition they did not ravage the Country But his Design was to cut them off in the Mountains which they being appriz'd of fell  upon him first defeated him and took his Tent  Arrive at the  Euphrates  Soon after they arrived at the  Euphrates  which they pass'd near the Source and continued their March through the Desart part of  Armenia  where several of them were lost in the deep Snows and the rest suffer'd extremely by Cold and Hunger After a Stay of seven Days to refresh themselves in the Villages they proceeded thro' the Countries of the  Phasiani Tachoi  and  Chalybes  which latter were reckon'd the stoutest People of the  Barbarians  But the  Grecians  again forc'd the Passes they held in the Mountains and made good their Descent into the Plain After which they arriv'd at the River  Harpasus  and from thence at a rich populous City call'd  Gymnias  They were very well receiv'd by the Governour of the Province who dismiss'd them with a Guide that brought them in five Days within Sight of the Sea  They are within Sight of the Sea  at which they burst out into Tears and Exclamations of Joy and embrac'd their Officers for having brought them within reach of several  Grecian  Colonies by which they might hope to be protected the rest of their March And of this they had an Instance in the next Province belonging to the  Macrones  who at first appear'd in Arms against them but finding them to be their Countrymen brought them Provisions and gave them free Passage From thence they advanc'd to the Mountains of  Colchis  where they met with some Opposition but got the better and in two Days  more  Arrive at  Trapezus  a  Grecian  Colony  arriv'd at  Trapezus  a  Grecian  Colony of the  Sinopeans  situate in the Country of  Colchis  upon the  Euxine  Sea  Here being almost beat out with the Fatigues of their long March they resolv'd to make the rest of their Way by Sea and deputed  Cherisophus  to the  Spartan  Admiral for Ships for that Purpose Whilst the Army waited his Return they subsisted themselves by their Incursions upon the  Barbarians  till at last after thirty Days Stay hearing nothing of him and the Country being quite exhausted they put their Women old and sick Men and Part of their Baggage on board some Vessels which they had stopt at  Trapezus  whilst the rest renew'd their March by Land and in three Days reach'd  Cerasus  another  Greacian  Colony  They review their Forces at  Cerasus  where upon a review of their Forces they were found to amount to Eight Thousand Six Hundred the rest of the Ten Thousand being dead either of the Fatigue Sickness or their Wounds  Upon their Arrival on the Frontiers of the  Mosynaeci  Oppos'd by the  Mosynaeci  and repuls'd  they were vigorously oppos'd and repuls'd with Loss but being encourag'd by  Xenophon  But rally and are victorious  they rally'd took the Metropolis and by that Means became Masters of the whole Country from thence they continu'd their March along the Coast  Arrive at Cotyora  till they arriv'd at  Cotyora  The Distance from the Field of Battle to this Place is computed at about Six Hundred and Twenty Leagues which from the Day of the Battle took  them up Eight Months Time of which they march'd an Hundred and Twentytwo Days They had hitherto preserv'd themselves in an intire Body but being a  terwards broken and diminish'd by their Divisions and other Accidents  Xenophon  for that Reason seems to finish their  Retreat  at this Place But as he still prosecutes his Account of them it may be proper to see what further Difficulties they meet with till they arriv'd nearer home and pass'd again into the Service of their Country  The Inhabitants of this Place at first refusing them Admittance they ravag'd the Country and liv'd at Discretion till by the Interposition of the  Sinopeans  to whom  Cotyora  was tributary they were supply'd from the Town During their Stay here of Fortyfive Days there was a general Enquiry made in the Nature of a CourtMartial into all the Abuses and Offences that had been committed in the Army whether by Officers or others since the Death of  Cyrus  and Punishments allotted accordingly Among others  Xenophon  was accus'd of having treated several of the Soldiers ill  Xenophon  accus'd  but he made it appear he had done nothing but what was necessary to preserve the Discipline and was acquitted with a general Applause  but acquitted  He had also form'd a Project of settling them in these Parts and sounding a  Grecian  Colony which was approv'd by some but his Enemies representing it to the Army only as a more honourable way of abandoning them and  to the Inhabitants as a Design to subdue and enslave the Country he was forc'd to give over that Enterprize However the Noise of it had this good Effect that the Natives did what they could in a friendly Manner to procure their Departure advising them to go by Sea as the safest Way and furnish'd them with a sufficient Number of Transports for that Purpose  Accordingly they embark'd with a fair Wind and the next Day got into the Harbour of  Sinope  where  Cherisophus  met them with some Gallies but instead of the Money they had also expected from him he only told them they should be paid their Arrears assoon as they got out of the  Euxine  Sea But this Answer occasion'd a great deal of murmuring and Discontent among them  The Army mutiny  so that they resolved to put themselves under one single General desiring  Xenophon  in the most pressing and affectionate Terms to accept of that Command which he modestly declined and procur'd the Choice to fall upon  Cherisophus  But he enjoy'd it not above six or seven Days for no sooner were they arriv'd at  Heraclea  than the Army depos'd him for refusing to extort a Sum of Money from the Inhabitants of that City which being a  Grecian  Colony  Xenophon  likewise refus'd to concern himself in that Affair so that the Army being disappointed in their Hopes of Plunder  and divide  fell into a Mutiny and divided into three Bodies of which the  Achoeans  and  Arcadians  were the principal consisting of Four  Thousand Five Hundred Foot and commanded by ten of their own Officers  Cherisophus  retain'd another of Two Thousand One Hundred and  Xenophon  the third of about the same Number forty whereof were Horse which indeed was all the Cavalry they had  The first Body having obtain'd Ships of the  Heracleotae  sail'd to  Calpe  a Port of  Bithynia Cherisophus  led his Troops by Land leaving what Ships he had to  Xenophon  who set sail and landing on the Confines of  Bithynia  march'd into the Country The  Arcadians  landing in the Night had plunder'd the Villages upon which the Inhabitants appear'd in Arms and almost entirely cut off two Regiments and surrounded a Hill where the rest were encamp'd  Xenophon  in the mean time receiving Advice of their Condition march'd to their Relief setting on Fire every thing in his Way that was combustible which struck such a Terror into the Enemy that they decamp'd by Night  Are reunited  Upon which the  Grecians  were happily reunited and encamp'd at the Port of  Calpe  where they settled the Command as before substituting  Neon  in the Room of  Cherisophus  who died here and making it Death for any Man henceforward to propose the dividing of the Army But being straiten'd for Provisions they were forc'd to spread themselves in the Villages where  Pharnabazus  's Horse being join'd by the Inhabitants cut in Pieces Five Hundred of them The rest escaping to an Hill  were rescu'd and brought off by  Xenophon  who after this led them thro' a large Forest where  Pharnabazus  had posted his Troops to oppose their Passage  Defeat  Pharnabazus  but they entirely defeated him and pursu'd their March to  Chrysopolis  of  Chalcedon  having got a great deal of Booty in their Way  Arrive at  Byzantium  and from thence to  Byzantium  Pharnabazus  who fear'd they would be strong enough to dispossess him of his Government had been practising with  Cleander  the Governor of  Byzantium  and  Anaxibius  the  Spartan  Admiral to use all possible Means to hasten their Departure Accordingly  Anaxibius  got them out of the City Gate under a pretence of reviewing them and told them They would meet with Plenty of Provisions in the  Thracian  Villages and that they should proceed to the  Chersonese  where he would take care they should be paid their Arrears But they were so ill satisfied with these Promises that they reenter'd the Gates in a tumultuous Manner and put the City into the utmost Confusion They address'd themselves to  Xenopho  telling him  Propose to plunder the City  That now was the Time to make himself great and them rich and that they ought not to slip this Opportunity of furnishing themselves with every thing they wanted To appease them he seem'd at first to comply with their Demands then having drawn them up in a large Square of the City  but are restrain'd by  Xenophon  he represented to them the ill Consequence of plundering the City and thereby incensing the  Spartans  who held the  Sovereignty of  Greece  and had  Athens  in their Alliance That this would involve their Country in a dangerous War and themselves in inevitable Ruin since it was equally impracticable for them to make their Retreat to the  Persian  or any of the Countries thro' which they had forc'd their Passage or to return home to which he added how much it would sully the Glory of their  Retreat  That after having spared so many of the  Barbarian  Cities they had plunder'd the first they came to in their own Country and murder'd so many of their Friends and Relations This Harangue had so good an effect that they immediately chang'd their Resolution and march'd out of the City without committing the least Disorder which was intirely owing to  Xenophon  who to the Courage and Conduct he had shewn in every Circumstance of the  Retreat  had added this extraordinary Instance of his Mildness and Humanity and the Force of his Eloquence And this was testified of him at large in a Letter from  Chio  a Philosopher then in the Town to a Friend of his wherein he tells him  He had been an Eyewitness of the Skill and Temper with which  Xenophon  had allay'd the Fury of the Soldiers that he could not forbear going to thank him as the Author of his Deliverance and was struck with the Sight of a Man who had nothing terrible or severe in his Looks but entertain'd him in the most meek and agreeable Manner on several Subjects and who knew so well how to reduce Philosophy to Practice  The Troops being thus appeas'd  Xenophon  leaves the Army  Xenophon  took his Leave of them and retir'd into the City with a Design to embark for  Athens  But as they proceeded to the neighbouring Villages they were divided in their Opinion as to what Course they should take  but is prevail'd upon to return to it  In these Uncertainties he was prevail'd upon to return to the Army and was receiv'd with all imaginable Demonstrations of Joy At the same time there was an Overture made to him from  Seuthes  He assists  Seuthes in Thrace  King of the  Odrysians  in  Thrace  with a Promise of great Rewards both to the Officers and Soldiers in case they would enter into his Service He accepted the Offer and led them into the Service of that Prince who by their Assistance gain'd great Advantages over his Enemies insomuch that the whole Country submitted to him  They had no sooner reestablish'd him in his Dominions but  Thimbron  the  Spartan  General sent them Word he was order'd by the State to declare War against  Tissaphernes  and that they should receive all fitting Encouragement if they would assist him  Seuthes  not being able to pay them their Arrears and having no further Occasion for them did what he could to encourage the Proposal tho' they were of themselves desirous enough to serve again in the Cause of their Country besides that they were glad of such an Occasion of revenging the Treachery of  Tissaphernes  to them in their Retreat So that they easily gave into it and were so warm upon it that an  Arcadian  accused  Xenophon  of having detain'd them so long out of that Service  He is again accused by the Army  only to enrich himself at the Expence of their Lives and Labours and added That as to his part what little he had he would freely give to see him stoned to death Another stood up and seconded this Motion and a third spoke to the same Purpose He made it appear in his Answer to this Charge that he had acted in every thing for the Good and Safety of the Army that as to his own particular he had not receiv'd the Rewards which were promised him nor even so much as several of the other Captains and appeal'd to  Seuthes  himself for the Truth of it He modestly hinted to them his past Services which they had promised never to forget when in their Dangers and Fatigues they gave him no other Name than that of  Father Saviour  and  Deliverer  and in the end reproach'd them with the rankest Malice and Ingratitude They were so well satisfied with his Defence that several spoke in his Favour and nothing more of a Complaint was urg'd against him  but is acquitted  So that they prepar'd for their new Expedition and he embark'd with them and sail'd to  Lampsacus  in  Mysia  From thence they march'd to  Troas  and crossing Mount  Ida  arriv'd at  Antandros  whence coasting along they gain'd the Plain of  Thebe  His Success at  Pergamus  and arriv'd at  Pergamus  in  Lydia  where  Xenophon  with a Detachment of Three Hundred Men took a  Persian  Lord with all his Equipage and a great Sum of  Mony  Thimbron  takes the Army under his Command  The next Day  Thimbron  arriving there took them under his Command and join'd them to his own Troops in order to carry on the War in  Asia  Thus in the first Year of the Ninetyfifth  Olympiad  A M  Olym    ended this memorable Expedition of this Body of  Grecians  who notwithstanding the many Adventures and Impediments they met with and which took up so much of their Time perform'd the whole Journey of between Four and Five Thousand  English  Miles forwards and backwards in the Space of about Nineteen Months from their first setting out till their Arrival at  Pergamus  It is true indeed that upon a Review of the Forces at  Cerasus  there appear'd to be but Eight Thousand Six Hundred Men and after their Service under  Seuthes  there is Mention made but of Six Thousand which last Diminution of them was owing to their Divisions and going in separate Bodies in Search of Plunder as they came nearer home But yet that any such Number of them should escape as did actually reach the Confines of  Greece  seems almost incredible That after the Death of  Cyrus  which struck such a Damp into the rest of his Forces they alone should have Courage enough to continue the War to oblige the  Persian  to sue to them for Peace and furnish them with Provisions That after the treacherous Murder of their Officers they should be still hardy enough to make their Way in Defiance  of a numberless Army that could neither take them by Force nor circumvent them by Stratagem That they should traverse the Body of that vast Empire with so many barbarous Nations on all Sides to dispute their Passage over Rocks and Mountains almost inaccessible and such Rivers as the  Tigris  and  Euphrates  and all this with the Countenance rather of Conquerors than of despairing successless Adventurers exposed to the Fury of a powerful incensed Monarch with a victorious Army these are Circumstances which would not easily gain Credit if they had not been describ'd and attested by  Xenophon  who has done it with such Exactness and Fidelity and at the same time with such Modesty in regard to himself that the only Doubt remaining is whether he gain'd more Honour by the Share he had in the Expedition or by the Account he has given of it  But it is time now to return to  Greece  which we left chiefly under the Direction of the  Spartans  who contenting themselves with the Submission of the several States to them at home were meditating other great Designs and resolv'd to push their Conquests abroad The first Occasion that offer'd was from the  Ionians  They were afraid of the Power of  Tissaphernes  who as a Reward for the Service he had done  Artaxerxes  in the late War with his Brother  Cyrus  had the Government of all the Cities he had possessed in those Parts conferr'd on him and therefore  they begg'd Assistance from  Sparta  to support them in their Liberties Their Request was easily granted and a Body of Five Thousand Men with Three Hundred  Athenian  Horse were sent to them under the Command of  Thimbron  who appear'd among them but would not venture to take the Field till he was join'd by the Remainder of the  Ten Thousand  at  Pergamus  with which Forces he took that and several other illfortified Towns and then laid Siege to  Larissa  But before he could take it he was recall'd by the  Ephori  Thimbron  recall'd and banish'd  and banish'd for having suffer'd the Soldiers to pillage the Countries of their Allies and was succeeded in the Command by  Dercyllidas  Athens  during the Time of  the Expedition of the Ten Thousand  and the breaking out of this fresh War in  Asia  was very quiet with its Neighbours and endeavouring to recover itself from its late Confusions in the Government at home But there were still some Seeds of Rancour and Malice left among the Citizens which two Years after the Expulsion of  the Thirty  broke out upon  Socrates  and occasion'd his Death The chief Instrument in it was  Anytus  who engag'd  Melitus  and  Lycon  to join with him in accusing him to the State Accordingly  Melitus  drew up his Accusation  Socrates  accus'd  containining in Substance  That he did not acknowledge the Gods of the Republick but introduced new Deities in their room  and further  That he corrupted the Youth  He urg'd in his Defence  That he had assisted  His Defence  as others did at the Sacrifices and solemn Festivals and appeal'd to  Melitus  himself for the Truth of it He denied his endeavouring to establish any new Worship He own'd indeed he had receiv'd frequent Admonitions from a  Divine Voice  which he call'd his  Daemon  that constantly attended him and discover'd to him Things to come that he had often made use of this Divine Assistance for the Service of himself and his Friends But that if he had been thus particularly favour'd from Heaven it was owing chiefly to the Regularity of his Life and Conduct and that the Approbation of the Gods which was given him as the Reward of his Virtue ought not to be objected to him as his Crime Then as to the other Article wherein he was branded with a criminal Passion for young Men he said He had no other View in his Conversation with them than to regulate their Morals that as he could not do this with any publick Authority he was therefore forc'd to insinuate himself into their Company and to use in a manner the same Methods to reclaim that others did to corrupt them  How far the whole Charge affected him is not easy to determine It is certain that amidst so much Zeal and Superstition as then reign'd in  Athens  he never durst openly oppose the receiv'd Religion and was therefore forc'd to preserve an outward Shew of it But it is very probable from the Discourses he frequently held with his  Friends that in his Heart he despis'd and laugh'd at their monstrous Opinions and ridiculous Mysteries as having no other Foundation than the Fables of the Poets and that he had attain'd to a Notion of the  One Only True God  insomuch that upon the account both of his Belief of the Deity and the Exemplariness of his Life some have thought fit to rank him with the  Christian Philosophers  And indeed his Behaviour upon his Trial was more like that of a  Christian Martyr  than of an  Impious Pagan  where he appear'd with such a compos'd Confidence as naturally results from Innocence and rather as  Cicero  observes as if he were to determine upon his Judges than to supplicate them as a Criminal  But how slight soever the Proofs were against him the Faction was powerful enough to find him guilty There was the Form of a Process against him and his Irreligion was the Pretence upon which it was grounded but his Death was certainly a concerted thing His steady uninterrupted Course of obstinate Virtue which had made him in many Cases appear singular and oppose whatever he thought illegal or unjust without any Regard to Times or Persons had procur'd him a great deal of Envy and Illwill Insomuch that he had several Years before been publickly attack'd upon the Stage in the  Play  call'd  The Clouds  where he is introduc'd as the Author of many gross Impieties which some  say  Aristophanes  wrote out of a personal Pique to him others that he did it only according to the Liberty then indulg'd to the Stage and intended in the Person of  Socrates  to expose and ridicule the Philosophers in general But most are of Opinion that it was at the Instigation of  Anytus  who look'd upon him as a dangerous Man and took that Method of preparing the People for his Condemnation whenever an Opportunity should offer This agrees with the Terms proposed to him even after the Accusation was given in when perhaps he was not sure of carrying his Point against him He hinted to him that if he would talk less freely and not take upon him to censure and arraign the Administration he would yet endeavour to stifle the Affair and save him It was upon the same Account that he was forbid conversing with the young Men Those at the Helm were jealous of his tampering with them in relation to the Government and this seems to be the Grounds of that Part of his Accusation But he was not to be bought by Bribes or deter'd by Menaces in short he had more Plainness and Integrity than the Times would bear and therefore fell a Sacrifice to the Corruption of those whom his Honesty had made his Enemies  It was a Privilege in  Athens  after Conviction to demand a Mitigation of the Punishment But that he said would be owning himself guilty and he chose rather to defy and incense his Judges so that they unanimously pass'd Sentence  of Death upon him  He is condemn'd  by drinking the Juice of Hemlock which was not put in execution till thirty Days after  and executed  during which Time he conversed with his Friends with the same Evenness and Serenity of Mind he had ever done And tho' they had bribed the Jailor for his Escape he refus'd it as an ungenerous Violation of the Laws He was about seventy Years old when he suffer'd which made him say he thought himself happy to quit Life at a Time when it begin to be troublesome and that his Death was rather a Deliverance than a Punishment This agrees with his last Words to his Friend  Crit  just before he expir'd  We owe a Cock  said he to Aesculapius  don't fail to pay it him  thereby intimating that he should sacrifice for him  that God as if he had recover'd from a Diseas  His Innocence soon after appear'd in such live  Colours that the  Athenians  imputed all the Mi  fortunes of the Republick to his unjust Condemnation and to avert the Vengeance of Heaven thought themselves oblig'd to make suitable Expressions of Repentance which they did by revoking his Sentence with a publick solemn Lamentation and by condemning his Accusers From thence their Love and Respect to his Me  mory rose even to Veneration insomuch tha  they erected his Statue and dedicated a Chap  to him  He was born in the fourth Year of the seventy seventh  Olympiad  His Chaacter  of indifferent Parentage an  as bred to his Father's Business of a Statuary  ut soon quitted it for the Study of Natural Phi  osophy wherein he made a good Proficiency But finding it so defective and unsatisfactory that  e could ground no certain Principles upon such  Diversity of Opinions he turn'd his Thoughts wholly to the Nature of Man and by diving  eep into the Passions and Affections endeavour'd  ather to cultivate the Heart than the Reason  nd rather to regulate the Manners than refine  e Wit It is said of him that he had naturally a Disposition to Vice but he so far got the  etter of himself as to make Virtue habitual to  im and was therefore the better prepar'd to  plant it in others So that he was the first who settled the standing Rules of Good and Ill  nd is to be look'd upon as the  Founder of Moral Philosophy  His Life and Doctrine were one con  nu'd Lesson of Virtue which he inculcated  ith Candour and Modesty Easiness and Affa  ility and temper'd the Dryness of his Maxims with an Air of Humour and Pleasantry as know  g that to please was the surest Method to  ersuade and by this Means he took off that  gged and unsociable Dress that Philosophy then  ore If he sometimes went out of his Cha  acter it was in Opposition to the Sophists he  ould not bear their deluding all the Youth of  hat Time with a superficial Tincture of the Sci  nces and therefore took all Occasions of con  ting their false Reasonings and of mortifying  their Arrogance As to his own way of reasoning it was very just and yet uncommon He began with doubting enquiring and asking of Questions as if he sought rather to receive Instruction than to give it and from the Answers which must be naturally made his Inferences were undeniable He had a way of leading People insensibly from one Absurdity to another till they came to the Point he aim'd at‚ñ™ and by the most familiar Comparisons mad  the Truth so plain as to become in a manner th  Object of their Senses By which Means he  voided the Odium of dictating and left to ever  one the Pleasure of convincing himself H  Studies did not so wholly employ his Time as  make him in other Respects an idle Member  the Commonwealth He made several Ca  paigns in the  Peloponnesian  War where being  the Actions at  Potidaea Delium  and  Amphipol  he had the good Fortune to save  Alcibiades  Xenophon  from falling into the Enemies Hands  and he gave such further Proofs of his Courag  that when his Party was at last forc'd to retre  'tis said of him  He did not fly as others  measur'd back the Field by Inches  Some Part  his Time he devoted to his Love of Musick an  Rhetorick He had also the Reputation of  good Poet insomuch that he is said to have  a Hand in several of  Euripides  's Plays But  had used these kinds of Study rather as Amu  ments than his Business and in Subs  rviency  is other great Designs It was upon these oc  asions that the Oracle stiled him the  Wisest Man  It was by these Methods that he kept up  he Reputation of the City and by his nume  ous Followers establish'd in it the Glory of Phi  osophy and that at a Time when it had lost  he Power of Empire  CHAP II  From the Death of Socrates to the Peace of Antalcidas Containing the Space of Years  DERCYLLIDAS  had now taken  Thimbron  's Army under his Command  A M Olymp  and finding  e had both  Tissaphernes  and  Pharnabazus  to deal with at the same Time took Occasion from a  ique between them to practise secretly with the  rst who was the most active and had the  reatest Interest in the Soldiery and struck up a  eace with him in order to attack the other with more Vigour and Security  Dercyllidas  his Successes  Accordingly  e invaded his Province and several of the  Aeolian  Cities assoon as he appear'd before 'em  pen'd their Gates to him some after a little  hew of Resistance submitted and others he gain'd by Stratagem so that in eight Days he  took Possession of nine Cities After which he made a Truce with  Pharnabazus  and retir'd to  Bithynia  where he spent the Winter in destroying and ravaging the Country for Provisions  Being continu'd another Year in his Command  Olymp  he renew'd the Truce with  Pharnabazus  and going into  Thrace  shut up the  Isthmus  of the  Chersonese  with a Wall to protect the neighbouring Cities from the Incursions of the  Barbarians  From thence repassing into  Asia  he took  Atarna  a strong Place in  Ionia  in Possession of the Exiles from  Chios  but this was a Work of above seven Months Afterwards understanding that  Tissaphernes  and  Pharnabazus  had joined their Forces against him he march'd with a Design to give them Battle but first in an Interview with them demanded the Liberty of the  Grecian  Cities  Tissaphernes  demanded on his Side that the  Spartan  Army should withdraw out of the Country on which Condition a Truce was concluded till such time as they could receive further Instructions from their respective Masters  Whilst these things were doing in  Asia  The  Spartans  quarwith the  Eleans  the  Spartans  began a Quarrel with the  Eleans  for having in their former Alliances constantly sided with  Athens Argos  and other States at War with them and for not having admitted them as well as the rest of  Greece  to the  Olympick Games  Upon these and such like other frivolous Pretences they sent Ambassadors to demand of them That they should restore the Cities under  heir Jurisdiction to their ancient Rights and Pri  ileges and in case of a Refusal to make a  ormal Declaration of War The  Eleans  urg'd  their Defence That as they had gain'd those Cities by the Sword they had the sole right of  sing and disposing of them as they thought  roper Whereupon  Agis  one of the  Spartan  Kings was sent to harass the Country with Fire  who by appearing in that manner  mong them encourag'd  Leptis  and several o  er Towns to revolt from them so that meet  g with little Opposition he march'd to  Elis  d as he was upon the Point of taking and  undering it the Inhabitants capitulated and  greed to the Terms insisted on of dismantling  heir own City and of making  Cyllene  and all  he other Towns free and independent of them  nd thus the  Eleans  were taken into the Alliance  Sparta  The Grounds of this Rupture were  slight and trifling that it plainly appear'd how  dustriously the  Spartans  had promoted it and  ow greedily they laid hold of every thing that  ok'd like a Handle for exerting their Power  st they should lose that Spirit and Discipline  y which they had arriv'd to it and not be able  maintain the Title they then enjoy'd of  The  rotectors and Arbitrators of  Greece But this  otion carry'd them so far as to make them  uilty of the same Injuries and Abuses they pre  ended to redress and in the end prov'd de  ructive both to themselves and their Neighbours  Agis  had made two Campaigns of this Expedition  Agis  the  Spartan  King dies  after which he return'd home and died and had a Monument erected for him more sumptuous and magnificent than any of his Predecessors He left  Son call'd  Leotychides  but his Legitimacy being suspected his Uncle  Agesilaus  disputed the Succession with him  Is succeeded by  Agesilaus  and being supported by  Lysander  carry'd it His Reign was usher'd in with a Conspiracy against him  an Account whereof being given in to the  Eph  n  they apprehended one  Cinadon  as the Principal‚ñ™ and being ask'd how he came to be concern'd in this Treason he could give no other Reason for it than that he could not bear any Man  the City greater than himself upon which  was executed with several of his Accomplices  The  Phaenicians  were at this time fitting out  great Fleet for the Service of the  Persian  which so alarm'd the  Spartans  that they resolv'd to send a fresh Army into  Asia  upon the old Pretence of freeing the  Grecian  Cities The Matter was propos'd by  Lysander  who also desired the Command of these Forces having  Design to reestablish in those Cities the  Decenvirate  which was the Form of Government  was always most fond of But  Agesilaus  inclining to go himself the other desisted tho' it cam  to be a long Debate Whether they should tru  him with that Post on account of an Advic  the Oracle of  Delphi  had given them  That  Republick should go near to be destroy'd when  Regal Government halted  for  Agesilaus  was lame of one Leg This had also been made use of as an Objection to him in his Pretensions to the Succession But at last they salved the Matter with this Resolution  That it was better for the King to halt than the Kingdom  and accordingly he was sent with Eight Thousand Men and Provisions for six Months  Who is sent into  Asia  Being arriv'd at  Ephesus  A M Olymp  Tissaphernes  amus'd him for some Time under a Pretence of waiting for Dispatches from the King his Master and having in the mean time got together a great Army  His Successes there  let  Agesilaus  know he would declare War against him if he did not retire out of  Asia  But he was so incensed at his tricking him in this manner that he immediately enter'd  Phrygia  where he took several Towns and met  Pharnabazus  's Forces but for want of Cavalry did not venture a Battle  But having soon after procured a great number of Horse which he had demanded of the Cities there by way of Contribution he engaged  TissapherneS  's Army and gain'd a signal Victory near the River  Pactolus  where he forced the Enemy's Camp and found in it a great deal of Mony and other rich Booty  Tissaphernes  himself not being in the Action the King suspected his Fidelity and looking upon him as the Author of this and several other Miscarriages caused him to be beheaded  The next Year he sent  Tithraustes  in his room  Olym  who endeavour'd to gain upon  Agesilaus  by Treaty He sent to let him know that his Predecessor had deservedly been punished with Death as being the Author of this War that as to his own part he would pursue other Measures and would allow the  Asiatick  Cities their Liberty provided they would pay the customary Tribute and that the Army withdrew To which the other answer'd he could do nothing in it till he received Orders from  Sparta  However  Tithraustes  prevail'd with him in the mean time to draw his Forces towards  Phrygia  and gave him Thirty Talents for their Subsistence Upon his March he received Dispatches from  Sparta  to let him know the State approved of his Proceedings and gave him a Power of appointing an Admiral to act in concert with him by Sea Accordingly he procured from the Isles and Maritime Towns an Hundred and Twenty Gallies and gave the Command of them to  Pisander  He appoints Pisander Admiral  his Wife's Brother a Man of Fire and Ambition enough but in other respects not equal to that Charge especially considering he had so experienc'd and vigilant  Commander as  Conon  to deal with  However these great Preparations from  Sparta  gave a fresh Alarm to the  Persians  who  finding they could not prevail upon  Agesilaus  either by Menaces or Persuasions to quit  As  resolved upon a more effectual Expedient by  making a Diversion and removing the Seat of the War They knew how ill affected most of the  Grecian  States were to that of  Sparta  on account of her late absolute and tyrannical Treatment of them and thought this the most proper time to stir them up against her and to rouse in them a Sense of recovering their Liberty  The  Persians  incense the  Thebans  and other States against  Sparta  To which purpose  Tithraustes  sent over  Timocrates  to practise with the Orators and other leading Men of the principal Cities and to make his Commission more effectual gave him Fifty Talents to dispose of among them as he saw proper It was upon this Occasion that  Agesilaus  afterwards upon his Return Home said  He had been drove out of  Asia  by Thirty Thousand Archers  by which he meant so many Pieces of the  Persian  Coin which was stamp'd with the Figure of an Archer  Conon  is by some thought to have been the Author of this Advice He had during his Retreat in  Asia  after the Defeat of the  Athenians  at  Aegospotamos  made it his Business to ingratiate himself with the  Persians  in hopes by them to gain an Opportunity of retrieving the Misfortunes of his Country With that View he took all Occasions to incense them against the  Spartans  and to traverse their Designs insomuch that  Nepos  ascribes it to him that  Agesilaus  did not penetrate further into  Asia  and carry his Conquests as far as Mount  Taurus  And  Justin  makes him signalize himself by many great Exploits  against that King personally But the Accounts of both these Historians in that Respect are too confused and inconsistent to be reconciled with others or even with themselves Neither can we with any Certainty affirm that he appear'd in Action till after  Agesilaus  had quitted  Asia  We may however conclude that he was before that making use of his Credit at the  Persian  Court to procure an Armament at Sea and that he was at least very instrumental if not principally concerned in forming a Confederacy of the other States of  Greece  against  Sparta  The first whom  Timocrates  treated with upon this Subject were the  Thebans  who easily hearken'd to the Proposal and received the Presents He met with the like Success at  Argos  and  Corinth  and these States work'd up several others to accuse and murmur against the  Spartans  in order to their uniting against them It is observable this is the first notorious Instance o  the  Grecians  being corrupted with the  Persian  Gold So much did they now begin to sin  from that zealous Spirit of Honour and Integrity Concord and Unanimity by which they were animated in the first  Persian  Wars I does not indeed appear that the  Persians  ha  before made them any such gross Overtures  betray and sell their Country But it might probably be because they thought it in vain The  knew they were not Enemies to be tamper  with in such a manner they sound them ever  where in earnest when they moved against them as one Soul and Body when they laid aside all domestick Dissensions to pursue the common Enemy and in short acted upon no other Principle than the Love of Liberty and the Defence of their Country This was the plain hardy and untainted Age of  Greece  which might have been of a much longer Duration if its Inhabitants had contented themselves with the Glory they had acquired at home But these Successes soon fired them with an Ambition of making themselves more formidable by enlarging their Bounds and extending their Conquests So that by throwing themselves out in Colonies and carrying their Arms abroad they had a freer Converse with other Nations And as by this means they arrived to quicker degrees of Knowledge and Politeness so on the other hand they became more luxurious and effeminate and more open to the Charms and Temptations of Riches They received the first Impressions of this kind from the Footing they got in  Asia  where they were struck and dazzled with the Pomp Wealth and Magnificence of the  Persian  Governors And tho' in all the Actions they had there they still behaved like  Grecians  and with a Sense of Glory yet they express'd too great an Eagerness to enrich themselves with Plunder In short the Love of Mony was now rooted in their Affections and it soon after visibly appeared in the Effects it  produced For as the  Grecians  had been bribed to quit their Pretensions in  Asia  so others afterwards made use of the same Methods to invade  Greece  And this will appear in the Sequel of the Story to be one of the principal Causes of its total Subversion As the  Spartans  kept up longest to the Rigour of their Discipline and the Force of their Laws they were a great while proof against Corruption and Bribery but the Contagion still spreading they at last yielded to the Example of their Neighbours It was then  Greece  became so divided and irresolute as to admit of no means for its Preservation when not only each State but also the leading Men in that State had separate Views of their own without any regard to the Good of the Whole  The  Thebans  The  Thebans  engage the  Athenians  in the Quarrel  as they were the first gain'd over to the  Persian  Interest so they were the most active in promoting it To strengthen their Alliance they sent Ambassadors to the  Athenians  with a long Representation of the present Posture of Affairs wherein they artfully insinuated their Zeal and Affection to their State from thence they took occasion to inveigh against the Tyranny of  Sparta  and concluded with telling them That now was the Time to throw off the Yoke and to recover their former Splendor and Authority The  Athenians  tho' they had no Share of the  Persian  Mony needed not many Arguments to engage  them in a Rupture of this kind for which they had been so long waiting a fit Opportunity  The first Act of Hostility broke out between the  Locri Opuntii  Hostilities begun  and the  Phocians  upon a Dispute about a piece of Ground and both Sides appeal'd to their respective Confederates for Justice and Protection The  Locri  were the Aggressors at the Instigation of the  Thebans  and the  Spartans  espoused the latter upon a particular Pique they had to  Thebes  which they thought it necessary to resent at this time when they found several other States arming against them Accordingly they ordered  Pausanias  to march with the  Peloponnesian  Forces and sent  Lysander  before to engage other Cities in  Boeotia  where having got together a considerable Army he invested  Haliartus  The  Thebans  immediately marched with their whole Strength and taking the Advantage of attacking him before  Pausanias  could come up to his Assistance defeated his Army  Lysander  kill'd  and he himself was kill'd on the Spot  Thus fell this great Man  His Character  after so many signal Services to his Country in giving  Athens  the most fatal Blow she had ever received and in raising  Sparta  upon her Ruins to a higher Pitch of Power and Grandeur than she ever attain'd either before or after him As it was by his means that  Sparta  did at this time in a manner give Law both to  Greece  and  Asia  so he himself became no less absolute in  Sparta  than  she was among her Enemies and Allies The Authority of her Kings was sufficiently abridged by the Constitution but by his working Genius and the Interest he had in the State upon the Reputation of his Services he made them appear still less and that in the Field too where they were least subject to be controuled An Instance of which we have in his going with  Agesilaus  into  Asia  where all the Court and Application was made to him and in every thing that pass'd of moment he had either the first hand or the finishing Stroke Insomuch that the King found himself obliged to take notice of it and that he might no longer appear a Cypher sent him upon other Service to the  Hellespont  Neither was it enough for him to eclipse the Power of the Kings and to impose his own Government of  Ten Men  upon all the  Spartan  Conquests but he was further endeavouring to alter the Succession of the  Heraclidae  in order to obtain the Sovereignty for himself As a Confirmation of this there was found among his Papers after his Death  A Discourse concerning the Government  which  Lacratidas  generously suppress'd saying  It would be inhumane to dig  Lysander  out of his Grave  He was undoubtedly a brave experienc'd Commander But his Dissimulation Craft and Treachery his Ambition Arrogance and Ostentation make up the greatest part of his Character and therefore it may seem pretty extraordinary that he should support  himself so long under so jealous and austere a Government as that of  Sparta  But he had a great deal of Artifice and Address and notwithstanding the Imperiousness of his Temper he knew how to curb it upon occasion and to suit it to his Circumstances So that where he found it necessary to make his Court he was contrary to the Manners of his Country very mild and tractable patient and submissive and had all the little Arts of Flattery and Insinuation It was with regard to these supple Qualities as well as to the Badness of his Morals in general that the Character of his Countryman  Callicratidas  has been set up in opposition to his and indeed it was quite the Reverse of it except in the Military Part and in that he was no way inferior to him But he was otherwise open candid and generous modest temperate sincere and just and was above making use of any Trick  or Subterfuge  Lysander  was so jealous of his Merit that when he was order'd to give up the Command of the Fleet to him he did what he could to lessen and distress him He went so far as to withold from him the Pay of the Seamen that was remaining in his Hands which besides the Meanness of the Action was betraying the Interest of his Country and hazarding the Safety of it in a very critical Conjuncture Upon the whole notwithstanding his great Atchievements he is not to be look'd upon as a true Patriot For it seems chiefly owing to him that the  Spartans  transgress'd the just Bounds of Power he had put into their Hands It was his Pride and Insolence his cruel and tyrannical Deportment and that under the Pretence of restoring Liberty which gave their Neighbours the first Impressions of Rancour and Resentment against them It was this that made them conceive an ill Opinion of their Government in general and laid the Seeds of those Alliances which were form'd against them and which at last prov'd fatal to them But they were not yet so sensible of the Consequences and therefore paid all due Respect to his Memory They went so far as to fine some who were under a Contract of Marriage to his Daughters but finding that their Father died so poor as to leave them no Fortune had deserted them It is certain he had reserv'd nothing to himself out of the Spoils of the  Atti  War which to the  Spartans  was a sufficient Argument of his Merit A stronger Instance of the Sense they had of his Loss was that they could pitch upon nobody but  Agesilaus  to succeed him who notwithstanding that he was carrying on the War in  Asia  with good Success was immediately recall'd to the Defence of his Country  After the Action  Pausanias  came up but durst not make another Attempt He only demanded the Bodies of the slain and yet could not obtain them upon any other Terms than quitting the Country  Pausanias  condemn'd  The  Spartans  judg'd his Proceedings very dishonourable and condemn'd him to Death  upon which he made his Escape to  Tegea  and died there  Towards the end of the Year  Agesilaus  ravag'd the Government of  Pharnabazus  and at  Dascyllum  his Winter Quarters took and plunder'd his Tent But that Governor some time after manag'd an Interview with him wherein he remonstrated That however he might be oblig'd to act for his Master's Honour and Safety he had not shew'd himself an Enemy to the  Spartans  but on the contrary had done them many good Offices in their War against the  Athenians  and that he was now inclin'd to act no otherwise against them than as he should be necessitated to it in order to support himself in his Command by which Means he prevail'd with  Agesilaus  to withdraw his Forces out of the Province Thereupon he descended into the Plain of  Thebes  and as he was preparing to march further into the Country receiv'd News of the War broke out in  Greece  with Orders at the same time for him to return home with which he readily comply'd  Agesilaus  recall'd from  Asia Olymp  And the Regard he therein paid to the Laws of his Country is particularly taken notice of that when he was prosecuting the War with great Increase of Honour and Advantage and had set his Heart upon the entire Conquest of the  Persian  Empire he had so much Command of himself as to stop in his full Career and abandon all out of a Deference to the  Ephori  who had recall'd him However he  left Four Thousand Men in  Asia  to maintain the Footing he had got there till such time as the Affairs of  Greece  would permit him to return and pursue his Conquests  But the  Spartans  could not wait his Arrival they found the War thicken on their Hands and were ready to be attack'd on all Sides  Timolous  a  Corinthian  propos'd the advancing immediately into their Territories in order to crush them singly before they could be join'd by their Auxiliaries  They set out  said he  by themselves only but in their March they gather Forces as they go till they grow too numerous to be withstood Like Rivers which are small at their Source and easily to be forded but as they continue their Course the Accession of other Waters makes the Stream too rapid  This Advice was judg'd reasonable and a Resolution was taken to pursue it But there being too much Time spent in debating the Command and Order of the Battle gave the  Spartans  an Opportunity of being join'd by the  Eleans Sicyonians Epidaurians Trezaenians  and others to the Number of about Fourteen Thousand Men and Thirteen Hundred Horse under the Command of  Aristodemus  who was also appointed Tutor to  Agesipolis  the other  Sparta  King during his Minority On the other Side were the  Athenians Argives Boeotians Corinthians  and  Euboeans  who made up about Two and twenty Thousand Men and Two Thousand Horse Both Sides encamp'd near  Sicyon  and  t so small a Distance from each other that it  oon came to a regular Battle  The  Spartans  gain a Victory near  Sicyon  wherein the  Spar  tan  Allies were almost entirely routed but they themselves maintain'd their Ground and bore so hard upon the  Athenians  who were in the left Wing opposite to their right that they recover'd the Day and gain'd the Victory by their own single Valour and with the Loss of not above eight of their own Men which bore no Proportion to that of their Enemies or Allies  The News of this Victory reaching  Agesilaus  at  Amphipolis  he sent back  Dercyllidas  with it into  Asia  to confirm the associated Cities there and pursu'd his March with all possible Diligence but not without some Opposition particularly from the  Thralli  in  Thrace  who having formerly sold the Passage thro' their Country to  Xerxes  demanded of him an hundred Talents and as many Women He ask'd them by way of Derision  Why they did not come to receive their Demands  And proceeding on his Journey made great Slaughter of them Then demanding a Passage thro'  Macedonia  the King sent him Word  He would consider of it So let him  said  Agesilaus and I'll go on in the mean time  The  Macedonians  did not much relish this  Laconick  Answer but they were not as yet in a Condition to resent it and therefore gave him no Disturbance Having afterwards defeated a Body of  Thessalian  Horse which attack'd his Rear he arriv'd in  Boeotia  where  he receiv'd Intelligence of a great Engagement at Sea  Conon  had prevail'd with  Artaxerxes  to fit out a Fleet  Conon  's Victory at  Cnidus  and to give the Command of it to him jointly with  Pharnabazus  They lay in the  Chersonese  with about ninety Sail where they had Notice that the  Spartan  Fleet consisting of an hundred and twenty Ships of their own and their Allies lay about  Cnidus  from whence  Pisander  who commanded it weigh'd Anchor and bore down directly upon the  Persians  In the first Attack he had the better of it but one Part of the  Persian  Gallies came up so seasonably to the Relief of the other that they turn'd the Fortune of the Day insomuch that the  Spartan  Confederates began to secure their Retreat The Admiral tho' he was so ill supported charg'd with his Ship in the Front of the Enemy where he did a good deal of Execution but at length was overpower'd and kill'd After which the  Spartans  retiring towards the Continent  Conon  pursu'd them and took fifty of their Ships the res  having recover'd their Port at  Cnidus  Agesilaus  having privately receiv'd this Ac+count thought fit to stifle or disguise it for th  present and used his utmost Endeavours to bring the Enemy to a speedy Battle before his Army could be more particularly inform'd and whil  they were flush'd with their last Victory Ac+cordingly he join'd the  Spartan  Allies and me  the  Athenians  with their Allies on the Plain  Coronea  Agesilaus his Victory at Corone  The  Thebans  began the Attack with great Vigour but were repuls'd by the extraordinary Courage of  Agesilaus  who notwithsanding that he was dangerously wounded push'd the Enemy till he gain'd a compleat and signal Victory but not decisive enough to put an End to the Hostilities which were still continu'd by Incursions into each other's Territories  The  Corinthians  complain'd  Olymp  that the chief Seat of the War being among them they were infested on all Sides being equally distress'd by their Enemies and burden'd by their Allies for which Reason they were inclinable to a Peace This was oppos'd by the Magistrates and other Citizens who had been corrupted with the  Persian  Mony And these Debates occasion'd a great Dissension and Massacre in their City  A Massacre at Corinth  which the  Spartans  easily improv'd to their Advantage making use of one of the discontented Parties to attack the other By which Means a Body of their Troops under the Command of  Praxitas  got within the Walls He defeated a great Number of the  Argives  who came up to the Relief of their Friends in the City and put to the Sword the  Boeotians  who had got Possession of the Port call'd  Lechoeus  He broke down a great Part of the Walls which were afterwards repair'd by the  Atbenians  and the whilst he was pursuing his Victory  Agesilaus  ravag'd the Country of the  Argives  and his Brother  Teleutias  the Admiral  scour'd the  Gulf  of  Corinth  taking their Ships and demolishing their Arsenals  The  Athenians  Iphicrates sent with Recruits from Athens  to put a Stop to these Successes sent a fresh Supply to their Army under th  Command of  Iphicrates  whose Conduct was in finitely above his Age having at twenty Year old arriv'd to such a Degree of Perfection in Mi  +litary Affairs that no  Athenian  Captain ever se  out with greater Expectation  About the Time of his Arrival with a Rein+forcement Deputations were sent from  Boeotia  and other Parts to sound  Agesilaus  in relation t  Peace but he rejected their Proposals with Di  +dain till hearing soon after that the Forces h  left at  Lechaeus  had been defeated by  Iphicrates  he was more inclinable to treat  His Saccess  s  But the  the Deputies stood off and insulted him in thei  turn demanding leave of him by way of De  +rision to go to  Corinth  Whereupon he di  +miss'd them and after he had reinforc'd th  Garrison of  Lechaeus  return'd to  Sparta  having by this last Action lost all the Honour of thi  Expedition  Iphicrates  upon his Departure wen  on successfully and recover'd all the Places th  had been taken by him and  Praxitas  The War was continu'd by little Skirmishe  and Incursions which chiefly affected the  Ach  +ans  as Confederates of  Sparta  They were ver  much infested by the  Acarnanians  who were sup+ported by the  Athenian  Allies But  Agesilaus  en  +  er'd  their Country with Fire and Sword and put  n end to this Quarrel  In this manner the  Spartans  maintain'd themselves and their Allies for some time without any considerable Increase or Diminution of Power But their Affairs at Sea were in a more declining Condition and the Effects of their Defeat at  Cnidus  began more visibly to appear The Cities in  Asia  over which they claim'd a Jurisdiction finding them so disabled in their Shipping and that they had Work enough upon their Hands at home readily hearken'd to  Pharnabazus  who encourag'd them to revolt from the  Spartans  The  Asiatick  Cities revolt from  Sparta  and expel their Governors which they consented to upon Condition they might enjoy their own Laws He was assisted in this Work by  Conon  who suggested to him that the leaving them in the free Enjoyment of their Liberty would be the surest Means to keep them in his Interest The like Attempts were made at  Sestos  and  Abydus  but  Dercyllidas  lying there secur'd those Parts  The next Year  Pharnabazus  and  Conon  pur  ing their late Victory  Olymp  procur'd another Fleet  rom the Towns upon the  Hellespont  with which  hey made a Descent upon the Maritime Parts of  Laconia  and ravag'd the Country After which  Conon  desir'd Leave to sail with the Fleet to  A  hens  with an Intent to repair the Haven of  Pi  aeus  Conon  rebuilds the Walls of  Athens  and rebuild the Walls which he repre  nted as a very important Pi  ce of Service against  parta Pharnabazus  not only comply'd with  his Request but gave him fifty Talents to be employ'd in that Work which was accordingly effected  The  Spartans  finding the War brought home to their own Doors  Overtures of Peace  Olymp    and that the  Athenians  reaping the Advantage of it might soon wrest the Sovereignty of  Greece  out of their Hands sent  Antalcidas  to treat with the  Persians  about a Peace He applied himself to  Teribazus  the Governor of  Sardis  and offer'd to give up the  Grecian  Cities in  Asia  provided the Islands and the other Parts of  Greece  might remain free An Overture of this Kind was easily hearken'd to But the  Athenians  and their Allies taking the Alarm sent Ambassadors on their Part likewise to join in the Negotiations and to support the Interests of their respective Principals But there were so many different Pretensions started th  they could not come to any Agreement among themselves and  Teribazus  did not think himsel  sufficiently authoriz'd by his present Instructions to conclude with the  Spartans  separately However he was so well affected to them that tho  the Treaty was at a stand he supply'd them it the mean time privately with Mony to maintai  a Fleet at Sea wherein he had a further View  that they might by that Means awe the othe  States into a Compliance with the Terms offer'd by them The  Spartans  likewise gain'd anothe  Point with  Teribazus  in relation to  Conon  +latcidas  had it in his Instructions to render hi  suspected and to inveigh against him as the chief Incendiary of the War and as having promoted it with no other View than to aggrandize the  Athenians  at the Expence of the  Persians  The Charge in fact was true and it was urg'd so strongly against him that as he was then at  Sardis  waiting the Event of the Negotiations  Teribazus  thought it proper to seize him and keep him in Custody till he should receive Orders from his Master how to dispose of him Some say he sent him to  Artaxerxes  who put him to death others that he escap'd out of Prison with the Consent or Connivance of  Teribazus  the latter whereof does not seem very probable because we find no further Mention made of him either in  Greece  or  Persia  So that we may conclude he died about this Time and that he fell a Sacrifice to his own illtim'd Zeal for the Service of his Country  Conon  's Death and Character  which certainly carried him further than was suitable to the Circumstances he was under He had lived as a voluntary Exile among the  Persians  who had given him their Protection and Assistance he had been favour'd and trusted by them he had by interesting' em in his Quarrel broke the Power of  Sparta  at Sea and repair'd the Ruins of his own City and both at their Charge and Hazard But not content with this he was at the same time practising against them and endeavouring underhand to withdraw from them several Cities and the whole Provinces of  Ionia  and  Aeolia  in order to annex  them to the Dominions of  Athens  and all this under a Pretence of rescuing them from the Tyranny of  Sparta  and securing them to the  Persians  They could not when they were let into a Discovery of these Artifices think he had made a suitable Return for what he ow'd them nor indeed can this Part of his Character be otherwise justified than by that false Principle which had generally obtain'd among the  Grecians  to give up every thing that interfered with what they call'd the Honour or Advantage of their Country This was carried so far as in some Cases to destroy the common Distinctions of Right and Wrong and the  Spartans  themselves notwithstanding their severe Justice in other Respects were so loose in this particular that nothing was esteem'd base that was beneficial Another Motive for his exerting himself in so extraordinary a manner might be in order to redeem his own Honour which does not seem to stand quite clear in the Affair of  Aegospotamos Nepos  indeed says he was absent from his Command at the Time of that Engagement and assigns that as the Cause of the Defeat But the most natural and authentick Account is that he was present in the Action but that being overpower'd by  sander  and seeing no Probability of Success on his Side made his Escape with eight or nine Ships and retir'd to  Cyprus  This agrees with what is further said of him that he was afraid and asham'd to return to  Athens  which it is plain he did not attempt till several Years after when he had done enough to wipe off that Stain The latter Part of his Life was certainly without Reproach either as to his Courage or Capacity of both which he had given sufficient Proofs and had made himself so formidable to the  Spartans  that they were glad upon any Terms to get rid of him and it was by the most abject Submission to the  Persians  that they compass'd it The Dread they had conceiv'd of him seems to have been the Grounds of that scandalous Peace which they soon afterwards concluded And as they began from that Day forward to decline in their Reputation and Power we may look upon  Conon  as having more remotely occasion'd their DownfaI  Upon the Offers of Peace made to  Teribazus  he went up to  Artaxerxes  to give an Account of his Proceedings and to receive fresh Instructions In the mean time  Struthas  was sent to command in the  Lower Asia  and to take care of the SeaCoasts He was not so well inclin'd to the  Spartans  as his Predecessor being more exasperated at what had been done by  Agesilaus  Whereupon they sent  Thimbron  with a good Body of Troops to keep him in Action which he did at first with good Success but ranging about with a separate Party in quest of Booty was surpriz'd by  Struthas  and kill'd He was succeeded by  Diphridas  Thimbron  kill'd Succeeded by  Diphridas  who was a Man of better Conduct at least of more Caution and he having  gather'd up the Remains of the Army maintain'd his Ground in the P  aces which had submitted to  Thimbron  There were at this Time two contending Parties at  Rhodes  Commotions at  Rhodes Olymp  concerning the Form of Government there and they were supported by their respective Patrons those for the  Democracy  by the  Athenians  and the others for the  Oligarchy  by the  Spartans  The latter being overpower'd and forc'd off the Island made their Complaints at  Sparta  and  Ecdicus  was dispatch'd with eight Ships to their Relief But finding himself too weak to do any thing to the Purpose  Teleutias  the Admiral was sent with twentyseven Sail with which he restor'd the Exiles and the  Oligarchy  This was a Matter of too much Consequence to the  Athenians  to be given up They were sensible how much their Sovereignty in the Island which was truly the Point in Question depended on the Form of Government which should prevail in it and therefore sent out  Thrasybulus  to put Things upon the former footing Before he durst attempt any thing at  Rhodes  he went into  Thrace  where he gain'd over two  Persian  Princes to the  Athenian  Interest he then took in  Byzantium Chalcis  and several other Cities upon the  Hellespont  and from thence he went to chastise the  Lesbians  who were all of them except those of  Mitylene  in the  Spartan  Interest Having succeeded thus far he sail'd towards  Rhodes  He had in his Way levied a  Sum of Mony for Contribution upon the Inhabitants of  Aspendus  But they being afterwards ill treated by his Soldiers rose in a great Fury and murder'd him in his Tent  Thrasybulus  murder'd His Character  Such was the End of this great Patriot to whom  Athens  ow'd as signal a Deliverance as any she had receiv'd in the  Persian  Wars We need only consider her Condition under the Tyranny of  The Thirty  when of those who had escap'd the Fate of a long War some had been murder'd others banish'd and their Estates confiscated when the City was one continu'd Scene of Outrage and Violence and when those few good Men who still remain'd and express'd a Sense of recovering the publick Liberty yet chose rather to content themselves with talking of it than really to attempt it Yet even then did  Thrasybulus  rise in a manner singly against the united Power of the Oppressors It having been already related with what Prudence Zeal and Intrepidity he conducted that Affair I will here only add an Observation which has been made that the Success of this Enterprize was chiefly owing to its desperateness For the Contempt with which  The Thirty  treated it in the Beginning made them neglect the proper Means of providing for their Sa  fety  Thrasybulus  in the mean time went on with his Design and encreas'd his Followers And when they sound him in a Condition to make head against them they thought fit to make him an Offer of sharing  in the Tyranny with them upon Condition he would desist But it was not to be suppos'd that one who had the Courage to project such an Enterprize and who had advanc'd it so far would hearken to any other Terms than the entirely restoring the Freedom of his Country His publickspiritedness together with his Fidelity Constancy and Magnanimity made him at least equal to the greatest Men of his Time There were several indeed whose Atchievements happen'd to make a greater Noise in the World But none of them had a more real Foundation of Merit And therefore  Nepos  says of him  That if Virtue were to be consider'd abstractedly from Fortune he should be inclin'd to give  Thrasybulus  the first Place in his Catalogue of Warthies  The  Spartans  at this Time sent  Anaxibius  with a small Supply of Mony and Shipping to retrieve their Affairs in the  Hellespont  And thereupon the  Athenians  to secure the Places recover'd by  Thrasybulus  order'd out  Iphicrates  with eight Gallies and twelve hundred Men being chiefly those who serv'd under him in his  Corinthian  Expedition Before any considerable Action happen'd on either Side  Iphicrates  intercepted  Anaxibius  in his Way to  Abydus  by an Ambuscade and rushing out upon him  Here  said the  Spartan  General to his Men  must I die take care of yourselves  And accordingly he was kill'd with a good Number of those about him  About the Time of these Transactions abroad  The  Aeginetans  infest the Coast of  Attica Olymp    the Coast of  Attica  was infested by the People of  Eegina  The  Athenians  made a Descent upon them and had in some measure block'd them up by Sea and Land but they were soon after repuls'd by them and the  Spartans  who assisted them and who had fomented the Quarrel Thereupon the Islanders renew'd their Insults till at length they were humbled by a Victory obtain'd against them by  Chabrias  But are repuls'd by  Chab  ias  an  Athenian  of good Reputation and those Seas were clear'd for the present  But  Chabrias  being soon after sent to the Assistance of  Evagoras  King of  Cyprus  and a Friend to  Athens  the  Spartans  took Advantage of his Absence and form'd a Design of surprising the  Athenians  Ships in their Harbour Accordingly  Teleutias  enter'd the  Piraeus  by Night where most of the Men being on Shore he took several Merchant Ships with three or four Gallies and sunk or disabled as many more as the Time would allow and having put the City under a general Consternation he return'd and prey'd upon the Coast seizing the FishingVessels with such other Booty as sell in his Way  In this manner did these States for some time carry on a kind of a pyratical War without any regular Engagement and without bringing things to any general Issue But the  Athe  ians  being so ha  fass'd on all Sides the  Spartans  having more Garrisons than they could maintain and their Confederates revolting from them and the other States being drain'd and tir'd out began by mutual Consent to think of a Peace with the  Persians  which  Teribazus  being now return'd from his Master had full Power to conclude  The Peace of  Antalcidas  The Conditions were  That all the Cities in  Asia  with the Island  s of  Clazomenae  should be under the Jurisdiction of  Persia  That the Islands of  Lemnus Imbrus  and  Scirus  as having from Time imm  morial been subject to  Athens  should still continue so  and  That all the other Cities of  Greece  should be left entirely free  Which Terms were submitted to by all but the  Thebans  who refus'd to give up their Jurisdiction over the Towns in  Boeotia  But they were afterwards overaw'd and forc'd into it  This Peace was concluded  A M Olymp  according to the most general Account in the second Year of the ninetyeighth  Olympiad  and was call'd  The Peac  of  Antalcidas if as  Plutarch  says that may be call'd a Peace which was  The Reproach and Rui  of  Greece It was not only giving up at once all the Footing  Agesilaus  had got in  Asia  bu  undoing all that had been done there by th  Grecians  in general ever since they were a Nation It was what the  Persians  themselves could not have ask'd or even hop'd for if the  Spar+tans  had not to their eternal Infamy made 'e  the first Overture the Grounds of which Overture was their Dread and Jealousy of the  A  ans  lest they shoulD recover the Power they  ad wrested from them The Colonies planted  Asia  had for many Ages been consider'd as a Part of  Greece  and the supporting and protect  ng them as such was the chief Pretence upon which the last War against  Persia  was founded Wherefore this Proceeding of the  Spartans  in  elation to the Peace was betraying and sacrificing  ne Part of their Country in order to maintain their Tyranny over the other This was plainly their Drift and  Antalcidas  was a very proper Instrument for the Purpose  His Character  When he went up to  the  Persian  Court to sollicit this Affair he took  are to conform himself to their Softness and Ef  eminacy he could join in a Ball upon Occasion and went so far as to play the Buffoon and in a wanton Dance to mimick  Leonidas  and  Callicrati  as  whose Names were rever'd at  Sparta  as hav  ng been the  Terror  and  Scourge  of the  Barba  ians  However by thus prostituting his Cha  acter and sacrificing even the Customs and Manners as well as the Liberty of his Country  e gain'd so far upon  Artaxerxes  that he shew'd him very uncommon Marks of Favour and Distinction which was the more remarkable because he naturally hated the Persons of the  Spartans  and look'd upon them as the most impudent of Mankind But notwithstanding that he was so highly honour'd and caress'd upon this Negotiation he afterwards met with the common  ate of that Sort of Agents For the  Spartans  being reduc'd to an Extremity and sending him again to  Artaxerxes  to press for Supplies he was treated by the King with great Coldness and Contempt and returning without Success he found the same Reception at home insomuch that fearing the Power and Severity of the  Ephori  he starv'd himself to death  CHAP III  From the Peace of Antalcidas to the Battle of Leuctra Containing the Space of Years  THE Treaty tho' it was principally between  Greece  and  Persia  was made to extend likewise to the  Grecians  among themselves and i  was provided by it  That whatever States should refuse to accede to it the other contracting Powers together with the  Persian  King should compel th  to it by Force of Arms  The  Spartans  affecting still the Sovereignty of  Greece  The insolent Behaviour of the  Spartans  after the Peace  dismember'd as i  was took upon them the Execution of this Par  of the Treaty and under the Notion of Guarantees explain'd it as they thought fit and according as they were sway'd by their Passion o  their Interest  They began with the  Mantineans  and the Year after the Peace sent their King  Agesipoli  to throw down their Walls which he effected  by turning against them the Course of the River  hat ran thro' the City by which Means the Foundation being sapp'd and weaken'd the Inhabitants despair'd of making any Defence and  apitulated This was the same Stratagem that  Cimon  formerly made use of when he took  Eion  situate upon the River  Strymon  They were oblig'd by the Terms of their Surrender to  anton themselves into Villages This Proceeding of the  Spartans  was in Revenge for their having taken Part against them in the late Wars and with a View to reduce them so as that they should not be in a Condition to unite against 'em Some other little States they treated less rigorously but yet with such an Air of Superiority and Controul as plainly shew'd they expected to be obey'd In order to keep them under their Dependence and at the same time to make them a little sanguine in their Interest they would in some Cases redress their Grievances restore their Exiles compose their Differences and do such other popular Acts of Justice as to make them think they were executing the Treaty to their Advantage and that they were the Authors of their Liberty And among the greater States they had oblig'd the  Corinthians  to withdraw their Garrison from  Argos  which with their freeing the  Boeotian  Cities and some other Instances of that kind had rais'd their Reputation for the present and taken off a good deal of the  Odium which they had contracted by the Treaty in other Respects  The People who gave them most Disturbance at this time  They quarrel with the  Olynthians  were the  Olynthians  who were started up on a sudden and grown so powerful that they not only held the neighbouring Places in Subjection but had overrun a great Part of  Macedonia  and taken many Towns with  Pell  the  Metropolis  wherein they copied after the Example of  Sparta  and under a Pretence of delivering those Places from the Tyranny of  Amyntas  their King had in a manner drove him out of his Dominions the Inhabitants of  Acanthus  and  Apollonia  Finding themselves under a Necessity of submitting to them if they were not supported against them represented their Case to the  Spartans  who looking upon the  Olynthians  with a jealous Eye made no Difficulty of granting their Protection to those Cities and immediately dispatch'd Two Thousand Men under the Command of  Eudamidas  who recover'd  Potidaea  and fortify'd several Parts of  Thrace  In the mean time his Brother  Phaebidas  was sent to join him with a greater Body of Troops  But an Incident happen'd in his March  Phaebidas  seizes  the Cadmea  at  Thebes Olymp  which prov'd to be of more Consequence to the Affairs of  Greece  than was at first apprehended When he arriv'd at  Thebes  he found the City divided into Factions one Party being headed by  Is  nias  and the other by  Leontiades  They were  two of the Polemarchs or Governors of the City and the latter being in the  Spartan  Interest and finding that he could not otherwise get the better of his Colleague betray'd the Citadel call'd  Cadmea  to  Phaebidas  then seiz'd  Ismenias  and forc'd his Party to the Number of Four Hundred to fly to  Athens  for Refuge This made a great Noise there and in the other Parts of  Greece  and even at  Sparta  they were so asham'd of it that they pretended to resent it for they were sensible the  Thebans  had done nothing in Violation of the Treaty since they had submitted to it that their domestick Dissensions did not concern the Publick and that  Phaebidas  had no Authority to intermeddle in them But this Action was excus'd by  Agesilaus  who was suppos'd to be at the Bottom of the Design He consider'd it in no other Light than as it was of Advantage to the Commonwealth and declar'd his Opinion  That if it answer'd in that Respect it matter'd not by what Authority it was done  He added further in Behalf of  Phaebidas That in an Enterprize of that Nature Orders were not to be expected  This way of reasoning so far prevail'd with the  Spartan  Government that they avow'd and justify'd the Action tho' at the same time they punish'd the Actor for they impos'd a Fine of ten thousand  Drachmas  on  Ph  bidas  and depriv'd him of his Command Which  Plutarch  takes notice of as a ridiculous Inconsistency And  Polybius  in condem  ing the  Aetolians  for a Procedure of the like Kind compares them to the  Spartans  who when  Phaebidas  had contrary to all Faith and Treaties seiz'd the  Cadmea  punish'd the Author of the Treachery but did not withdraw their Garrison as if says he that Punishment could wipe out the Injustice of the Action and give full Satisfaction to the  Thebans  He makes a further Remark applicable to the present Occasion that upon the Peace they proclaim'd publickly they would restore all the Cities to their Liberties and yet did not recall any of the Governors whom they had plac'd in them He then adds  That 'tis the Heighth of Madness join'd to the most consummate Wickedness to pretend that a Man needs only shut his ow  Eyes to hinder others from seeing him  However the  Spartans  kept Possession of the Citadel and confirm'd  Leontiades  in the Government to whom  Archias  was join'd in Commission as having been an Accomplice with him in the Treachery In the next Place they procur'd Articles to be exhibited against  Ismenias  for having taken Mony of the  Persians  and held Intelligence with them and for having been a principal Promoter of these intestine Broils  Isine  s  condemn'd  Upon which he underwent a formal Trial before three Commissioners deputed from  Sparta  and one from each of the other great Cities of  Greece  and was condemn'd to Death  The  Spartans  having in this manner secured  Thebes  The War carried on against the  Olynthians  prosecuted the War against the  Olynthians  The Command was given to  Teleutias  who with the Assistance of  Anupetas  defeated them under the Walls of the City after which he ravag'd the Country and went into Winter Quarters The next Campaign prov'd more successful to the  Olynthians  who having defeated a Party of the  Spartan  Army  Teleutias  march'd with the main Body to their Relief and charging furiously within Bowshot of the City his Men were very much gall'd and himself  kill'd  Teleutias kill'd  He is charg'd with more Passion and Rashness in this Enterprise than was suitable to his Post But however he might expose himself upon this Occasion  His Character  he had in the main behaved well in the Service of his Country and acquitted himself with Honour in both his Capacities of General and Admiral He was also rich and liberal and had endear'd himself so much to those who serv'd under him that upon his Return home in a former Expedition they flock'd about him to crown him with Wreaths and Garlands And  Xenophon says His manner of engaging the Affections of the Soldiers deserv'd more to be taken notice of than the Wealth he possess'd or the Dangers he underwent  But whatever his personal Merit was he ow'd a great deal to  Agesilaus  who was his half Brother and was chieFly instrumental in the raising and supporting him  The  Spartans  Succeeded By  Agesi  olis  as soon as they heard of his Death sent their King  Agesipolis  in his room He having collected the Forces which were much shatter'd and dispers'd by the last Action took  Torone  a Town in Alliance with the  Olynthians  and harass'd the Country but the Fatigue and extreme Heats of the Season threw him into a Fever  his Death  of which he died  Agesilaus  who had lived in good Friendship with him lamented his Loss There had indeed at his first setting out been a secret Emulation between them which  Agesilaus  perceiving easily got the better of and moulded him to his Purpose For being naturally modest and tractable but indolent withal and averse to Business his Colleague took care to cultivate in him this mild Disposition and in order to take off the Edge of his Ambition entertain'd him with Dogs and Horses and Loveaffairs and went so far as to recommend Boys to him and assist him in his Amours  He was succeeded in the Command by  Polybiades  Polybiades takes  Olynthus  Olym  who besieged  Olynthus  and reduced it by Famine The Conditions imposed on the Inhabitants were  That they shou'd have the same Friends and Foes with the  Spartans  and that they should join with them as Confederates in all their Wars  This War continued near three Years  The  Spartans  quarrel with the  P  siasians  and it was no sooner ended but the  Spartans  were call'd upon to chastise the  Phliasians  for having ill treated the Exiles who had lately been restored by  their Interposition They made their Complaints at  Sparta  and were fin'd for so doing But upon their repeated Instances for Protection the  Ephori  declared War and  Agesilaus  was sent to do them Justice He required of them to deliver up their Castle which they refusing to do he laid Siege to the City They made a very obstinate De  ence even to the imprisoning such as did but mention any thing of a Surrender 'till at length their Provisions failing them  Who are reduc'd by  Agesilaus  they were reduced to the last Extremity and sent to  Sparta  to obtain the best Terms they could In the mean time  Agesilaus  leFt a Garrison in the Town and re  urned home after he had spent above a Year and an half in this Expedition  The  Spartans  had by this time under colour of putting things upon that equal footing which was required by the Treaty gain'd such an In  rease of Power and Authority to themselves that there was no State in a Condition to make  ead against them But in the midst of this  ecurity they were alarmed from a Quarter where they least expected it The  Thebans  had  or four Years since the seizing of the Citadel  ubmitted to the  Spartan  Yoke  The  Thebans  recover the  Cadm  a Olymp  but they now  ook occasion by a very desperate Attempt to  hrow it off For which purpose there was a se  ret Correspondence carried on between the most  onsiderable of the Exiles at  Athens  and those  ho were well affected to them in  Thebes  and Measures were concerted between them by  Phyllidas  Secretary to the  Theban  Governors by whose Contrivan  e a competent Number of the Exiles were to get into the City and  Charon  a Man of the first Rank there offer'd his House for their Reception The Day being fix'd they set out from  Athens  and Twelve of the most active and resolute among them were detached to enter the City the rest remaining at a proper Distance to wait the Event The first who offer'd himself was  Pelopidas  who was young and daring and had been very zealous in encouraging the Design and by the Share he had in it gave a sufficient earnest of what might be further expected from him in the Service of his Country The next Man of Consequence was  M  +lon  who by some is said to have first projected the Affair with  Phyllidas  These two with their ten Associates dress'd themselves like Peasan  and beat about the Fields with Dogs and Huntingpoles as in search of Game By which means having pass'd unsuspected and convey'd them+selves into the City they met at  Charon  's House as the general Rendezvous where they were so  after join'd by Thirty six more of their Confe+derates It was concerted that  Phyllidas  sho  on that Day give a great Entertainment to  chias  and  Philip  the two Governors who we appointed by the  Spartans  and to make it  more compleat he had engaged to provide so  of the finest Women in the Town to give th  a Meeting Matters being thus prepar'd  Associates divided themselves into two Bands one of which led by  Charon  and  Mellon  were to attack  Archias  and his Company And having put on Womens Cloaths over their Armour with Pine and Poplar over their Heads to shade their Faces they took their Opportunity when the Guests were well heated with Wine to enter the Room and immediately stabb'd  Archias  and  Philip  with such others of the Company as were pointed out to them by  Phyllidas  A little before this Execution  Archias  received an Express from  Athens  with all the Particulars of the Conspiracy and the Courier conjured him in the Name of the Person who wrote the Letters that he should read them forthwith for that they contain'd Matter of great Importance But he laid them by unopen'd and with a Smile said  Business to morrow  which Words upon that Occasion grew into a Proverb  The other Band headed by  Pelopidas  and  Damoclides  went to attack  Leontiades  who was at home and in Bed They rush'd into his House by Surprise but he soon taking the Alarm leap'd up and with his Sword in his Hand received them at his Chamberdoor and stabb'd  Cephisodorus  who was the first Man that attempted to enter  Pelopidas  was the next who encounter'd him and after a long and difficult Dispute kill'd him From thence they went in pursuit of  Hypates  his Friend and Neighbour  and dispatch'd him likewise After which they join'd the other Band and sent to hasten the Exiles they had left in  Attica  The whole City was by this time fill'd with Terror and Confusion the Houses full of Lights and the Inhabitants running to and fro in the Streets in a wild distracted manner and waiting impatiently for Daylight that they might distinguish their Friends from their Foes and determine what course to take Early in the Morning the Exiles came in arm'd and  Pelopidas  appear'd with his Party in a General Assembly of the People encompass'd by the Priests carrying Garlands in their Hands proclaiming Liberty to the  Thebans  in general and exhorting them to fight for their Gods and their Country For tho' they had made such a prosperous Beginning the most difficult Part still remain'd whilst the Citadel was in the Possession of the  Spartans  with a Garrison of fifteen hundred Men besides a great Number of Citizens and others who had fled to them for Protection and declared themselves on their Side  Plutarch  who is very particular in the first Part of this Transaction which has been related chiefly from him passes over the taking the Citadel too slightly He only says that  Pelopidas  with  Charon  and  Mellon  block'd it up attack'd it and got possession of it before any Succours could arrive from  Sparta  But it is not probable that should be the Work of a Day or that it  should have been effected with so small a Force And therefore this Part is to be supplied from  Diodorus Siculus  who says that the  Athenians  early the next Morning after sent five thousand Foot and two thousand Horse to  Pelopidas  's Assistance and that several other Bodies of Troops came in from all the Cities of  Boeotia  to the Number of seven thousand that the Castle being besieged by this Army held out for several Days but surrender'd at last for want of Provisions Others say they capitulated more out of Fear than Necessity and that the Commander at his Return to  Sparta  was put to death for it However the Citadel upon which the whole depended was recovered and as the gaining that restored the  Thebans  to their former Liberty so it was the Foundation of their future Greatness  This Action bore so near a Resemblance to that of  Thrasybulus  whether we consider the Courage of the Actors the Hazards and Difficulties of the Undertaking the Manner in which it was conducted or the Success and Consequences with which it was attended that it was called  Its Sister  And  Pelopidas  proposed that Enterprise as a Pattern to the Exiles when he exhorted them not to content themselves with living in a lazy Dependence on the  Athenians  and to fawn for fear upon every smoothtongu'd Orator but to exert themselves like  Thrasybulus  and that as he had advanced from  Thebes  to break the Power of the Tyrants at  Athens  they should in like manner march from  Athens  to set  Thebes  at Liberty  The  Spartans  were so enraged and so far from giving up their usurped Dominion that they sent their King  Cleombrotus  in the Depth of Winter to make War upon the  Thebans  Whereupon the  Spartans  declare War against them  But after he had deseated some small straggling Parties he left the Prosecution of his Designs to  Sphodrias  who commanded in  Thespiae  The  Athenians  were afraid by entering into this Quarrel to draw the  Spartans  upon them and therefore withdrew their Protection and Assistance from the  Thebans  The  Thebans  on the other hand  The  Thebans  create a Quarrel bet  en  Athens  and  Spar  a  not thinking themselves able singly to cope with the  Spartans  contrived to create a Misunderstanding between these two States in order to bring over the  Athenians  to them Accordingly they practis'd underhand with  Sphodrias  and put him upon a Project of attacking the  Piraeus  as a thing that would redound to his Honour and be very advantageous and agreeable to his Principals He was brave and ambitious but rash withal and indiscreet and he was work'd up to it partly by flattering his Vanity and partly by Presents It was concerted  Ol  mp  that he should march in the dead of Night so as to be able to make his Attack upon the Place by break of Day But he fail'd in his Time and when he was got as far as  Ele  sis  the Design took Air and miscarried However  he had done enough to alarm and incense the  Athenians  who thereupon imprison'd the  Spartan  Ambassadors But the State disavow'd this Proceeding of their Officer and call'd him to an Account for it  Agesilaus  urg'd in his Behalf  That he was an honest Man and that the Commonwealth stood in need of such Soldiers  and got him acquitted which he is said to have done at the Intercession of his Son  Archidamus  who had a LoveAffair with  Cleonymus  the Son of  Sphodrias  This Attempt made in a profound Peace and without the least Provocation given was of the same kind with that of the  Cadm  a  tho' it had not the same Success and it was Matter of great Surprise that the Author of it should go unpunished It is therefore to be look'd upon as one of those glaring Instances of the Partiality of the  Spartan  Government in Cases wherein their Interest was concerned And the  Athenians  resented it accordingly For they immediately declared themselves on the Side of the  Thebans  and joining heartily with them drew to their Confederacy several of the Cities which were grown weary of the  Spartan  Tyranny  The  Spartans  Olymp  in order to retain those Places which had not yet revolted abated of their usual Severity to them  The Spartans invade  Boeotia  and sent  Agesilaus  and  Cleombrotus  by turns with a good Body of Troops into  Boeotia  where they made several Campaigns but did little more than shew themselves  and harass the Country with the Loss of many of their Men among whom was  Phaebidas  who since the Affair of the  Cadmea  commanded in the Garrison at  Thespioe  and afterwards in the Army upon the Absence of the  Spartan  Kings  The Man who signaliz'd himself most against the  Spartans  Are opposed by  Chabrias Olymp    was  Chabrias  the  Athenian  who had serv'd well at Sea and Land and was now pitch'd upon as the best Officer of his Time to oppose to  Agesilaus  who had enter'd  Boeotia  with eighteen thousand Foot and fifteen hundred Horse and whose Name struck such a Terror into the  Thebans  that they propos'd nothing more than standing upon their Defence and to that end possess'd themselves of an Hill near the City  Agesilaus  detach'd a Party of lightarm'd Men to provoke them to come down and give him Battle which they declining he drew out his whole Forces in order to attack them  Chabrias  His Successes  who commanded the Mercenaries on the Part of the  Thebans  order'd his Men to present themselves and keep their Ranks in close Order with their Shields laid down at their Feet and their Spears advanc'd and with one Leg put forward and the Knee upon the halfbent  Agesilaus  finding them prepar'd in this manner to receive him and that they stood as it were in De  iance of him thought fit to withdraw his Army and contented himself with ravaging the Country This was look'd upon as an extraordinary  Stratagem and  Chabrias  valu'd himself so much upon it that he procur'd his Statue to be erected in that Posture  The  Spartans  having done nothing considerable enough to answer the Losses and Expence of these Expeditions resolv'd to try their Fortune at Sea and fitted out a Fleet of seventy Sail under the Command of  Pollis  who endeavour'd to intercept a great Quantity of Corn design'd for  Athens  and had in a manner block'd up the City But  Chabrias  having Notice of this Design came up with the  Spartan  Fleet and having defeated it convoy'd the Transport Ships safe into the  Piraeus  Chabrias  acting offensively in his turn  The Victory at  Naxus  sail'd with the Fleet to  Naxus  and laid Siege to it and  Pollis  coming up to the Relief of the Island a very sharp Engagement ensu'd wherein the  Athenians  dispers'd the whole  Spartan  Fleet having destroy'd twentyfour of their Gallies and taken eight with the Loss of eighteen of their own  Chabrias  return'd with his Spoils to  Athens  and was highly honour'd this being the first Victory at Sea that had been obtain'd by the  Athenians  singly without the Assistance of the  Persian  since the  Peloponnesian  War And this had put them upon asserting their former Dominion at Sea  For this purpose they order'd their Fleet to sail round  Peloponnesus  Olymp  under the Conduct of  Timotheus  who was the Son of  Conon  and inherited  his Father's Virtues  The Successes of  Timotheus  He drew several Towns and Places on the Coast some by Force and others by Management and mild Treatment into the Alliance with  Athens  Whereupon the  Spartans  sent out  Nicolochus  with the Command of their Fleet to put a Stop to these Encroachments He was hot and daring and immediately fell in with the  Athenians  before his whole Number of Ships could join him But he was defeated and  Timotheus  erected a Trophy This Action happen'd near  Leucas  The  Thebans  taking Advantage of these Diversions at Sea recover'd all the Cities of  Boeotia  and invaded  Phocis  The  Spartans  grew every Day less terrible to them so that they began now to act offensively against them and had frequent Encounters with them And though they were not regular and decisive Battles they were such as serv'd to raise their Courage and gain them Experience and were introductory to those greater Actions which happen'd afterwards The Success of these little Engagements was generally on their Side and was chiefly owing to  Pelopidas  and of  Pelopidas  who signaliz'd himself in most of 'em In one of them at a Place call'd  Ta  agra  he slew the  Spartan  Commander with his own Hand But that which happen'd about the same Time at  Tegyra  was more remarkable  He had form'd a Design of surprising  Or  d  menus  The Battle  t  Tegyra  which was garrison'd by the  Spartans  and march'd against it with three hundred Foot and  ome Horse But receiving Intelligence that a great Body of  Spartans  were upon their March  o reinforce the Garrison he thought it adviseable  o retire In his Retreat he met this Reinforcement near  Tegyra  and being oppos'd by them he order'd his Horse who were in the Rear to advance and engage them relying on his Foot for the main Stress of the Battle The Attack was very furious on both Sides But  Gorgoleon  and  Theopompus  who commanded the  Spartans  soon sell and all who were near them were either kill'd or put to Flight which struck such a Terror into the rest of their Troops that they open'd a Passage for the  Thebans  to pursue their March But  Pelopidas  would not quit the Field till he had made a further Slaughter among 'em and thoroughly routed and dispers'd them He acquir'd more Reputation by this Retreat than he could have got by succeeding in his original Design against  Orchomenus  And it was a more signal Disgrace to the  Spartans  than they had hitherto met with for they had at least three times as many Men in the Field And it was never known before that in all their Wars whether against  Grecians  or  Barbarians  they had been beat by fewer Troops than their own or even by an equal Number It must indeed be allow'd that these three hundred Foot were the Flower of the  Theban  Army and they were distinguish'd by the Name of  The Sacred Battalion  The Sacred Battali    They were as remarkable for their Fidelity and  Affection to one another as they were for their Courage and in that respect were likewise call'd  The Band of Lovers  There are several fabulous Accounts concerning them But all that can be reasonably collected from them is that they were a brave determin'd Set of young Men who had vow'd perpetual Friendship and sworn to stand by one another to the last Drop of their Blood They were said to have been first rais'd by  Gorgidas  who was one of the Governors of  Boeotia  in Conjunction with  Pelopidas  and had a considerable Share in the Transactions of that Time He us'd them chiefly as a Guard to the Citadel but employ'd them occasionally in other Services of the War and upon an Engagement he chose to divide and mix them in the Ranks with the other Troops in order to animate them by their Example But  Pelopidas  found a better Effect in keeping them in one entire Body and after the Proofs they had given him of their Behaviour in this Action he constantly charg'd at the Head of them in the same manner without breaking and dispersing them They are said to have remain'd invincible till the Battle of  Cheronea  which happen'd some Years after when they were every Man of them cut down by the  Macedonian Phalanx  And the next Day  Philip  taking a View of the Field of Battle look'd on them with Surprise as they lay all together among the Slain and extolling their Virtue  p over them  It was this Battle of  Tegyra  says  Plutarch  which first convinc'd the  Grecians  that the Breed of martial Spirits is not confin'd to the Banks of the  Eurotas  but that true Courage and Bravery are the Growth of every Country where the Inhabitants are brought up with a Sense of Honour and Justice and are more afraid of the least Disgrace than of the greatest Danger  These Successes of the  Thebans  made the  Athenians  begin to think they gain'd Ground a little too fast and whatever Cause of Resentment they had against  Sparta  they did not care to carry it so far as to raise the Power of one State upon the Destruction of the other Which Consideration inclin'd them towards an Accomodation It happen'd at the same time that  Artaxerxes  wanting a Supply of  Grecian  Troops to assist him in his  Aegyptian  War and which could not easily be spar'd without putting an end to these intestine Broils sent his Ambassadors into  Greece  to renew the  Peace of Antalcidas  The Peace of Antalcidas renew'd  Olymp    which in the present Conjuncture met with very little Difficulty except from the  Thebans  who would not give up their Jurisdiction over the Cities of  Boeotia  The general Tenor of the Treaty was as before  That all the Cities for the future should be govern'd by their own Laws  with an additional Provision  That all the Garrisons should be withdrawn  which was accordingly executed by Commissioners appointed for that Purpose  During the short Respite that was by this Means given to the  Grecians  A Body of  Grecians  employ'd by the  Persians  against  Aegypt  Artaxerxes  engag'd twenty thousand of them in his Service against  Aegypt Pharnabazus  who had the Charge of the War and had been two Years in making Preparations for it had got together an Army of two hundred thousand Men besides this Body of  Grecians  with a proportionable Number of Shipping to act in concert with the Land Forces He sent to  Athens  to demand that  Chabrias  who then serv'd as a Voluntier with the  Aegyptians  might be recall'd home  Iphicrates  commands them  and that  Iphicrates  might be sent to command the  Grecians  both which Point  were readily complied with The general Rendezvous was at  Ace  afterwards call'd  Ptolemai    where it was resolv'd to attack  Pelusium  one o  the  Seven Mouths  of the  Nile  as the most convenient Passage into the Country But the  Aegyptians  had so long Notice given them to provide for their Defence that they had made that Place inaccessible both by Sea and Land Where upon  Pharnabazus  order'd the Fleet to  Mendesium  another  Mouth  of the  Nile  and made a Descent with three thousand Men who after a vigorous Resistance took the Place  Iphicrates  took the Fort likewise with those who had retir'd into it and being flush'd with this Success propos'd to go without Loss of Time to a  ack  Memphis  the capital City of  Aegypt  But  P  arnabazus  chose rather to stay till his whole Forces could come up in order to make sure Work of  it The other urg'd the Necessity of marching immediately against it and in order to cut off all further Pretences offer'd to do it with only his own Troops which being likewise refus'd it was plainly seen  Pharnabazus  is jealous of him  that  Pharnabazus  was jealous of his having too great a Share in the Honour of the Expedition Whilst this Matter was in Debate between them the  Aegyptians  put a strong Garrison into  Memphis  and drawing down the rest of their Forces against the  Persians  maintain'd their Ground and harass'd them till at length the Inundation of the  Nile  oblig'd them to quit the Country By these Means they lost the Prospect of taking  Memphis  the Consequence whereof must have been the Reduction of the whole Kingdom Such was the Fate of most of the  Persian  Expeditions which were generally ill concerted and worse conducted and were always attended with Delays which were chiefly occasion'd by their Generals Hands being tied up so that upon any sudden Emergency they often waited for Instructions from their Court till the Occasion was over And this was alledg'd by  Pharnabazus  in his Excuse to  Iphicrates  who expostulating with him upon the Operations of the War ask'd him  How it came to pass that he who was so quick in proposing his Measures was so slow in the Execution Because  said he  I am Master of my Words but the King is Master of my Actions  But this was not so much the Case of the present Miscarriage which was chiefly  owing to the Misunderstanding between the two Generals However  Pharnabazus  upon his Re  turn into  Asia  threw the whole Blame of it upo  Iphicrates  who did not think it proper there to justify himself He took warning from wha  had lately happen'd to  Conon  under the like Circumstances and therefore withdrew himself privately to  Athens Pharnabazus  sent his Complaint after him and the  Athenians  promis'd to punish him according as they should find he had deserv'd it But they found reason to be very well satisfied with his Behaviour and were so far from censuring it that soon after as a Mark of their Approbation they appointed him Admiral  In the mean time the several Cities of  Greece  especially those in  Peloponnesus  were no sooner put into a Condition of enjoying that Liberty which was now more fully restor'd to them but they fell into Tumults and Seditions among themselves with such Resentment of former Injuries upon those who had acted under the  Spartan  Administration that they banish'd their Persons and confiscated their Estates and created such further Disorders that the two States of  Athens  and  Sparta  sound themselves oblig'd to interpose in Behalf of those who were best affected towards'em and whose Quarrels they had formerly espoused  The Peace broke again in G  rerce  And this occasion'd another Rupture the Year after the Peace was concluded tho' it was not so general a one as before nor of so long Continuance  The first Contests were concerning  Zacynthus  and  Corcyra  Commotions at  Zacynthus  and  Corcyra  which were occasion'd chiefly by the  Spartan  Faction In the former of these Places the People had expell'd their Magistrates who flying to  Timotheus  for Protection he receiv'd them on board his Fleet and transported them back to the Island where by his further Assistance they got Possession of a strong Castle and maintain'd themselves against the Inhabitants The like Divisions subsisting in  Corcyra  the  Spartans  sent out  Mnasippus  with a Fleet under colour of assisting their Friends there But they knew of what Importance that Island was to the Recovery of their Dominion at Sea and their true Design was to secure it to themselves The Fraud being detected the Inhabitants in general united against them as their common Enemy and put themselves under the Protection of  Athens  But before they could receive any Relief from thence the  Spartans  had landed upon them and besieged them And when they found themselves straiten'd for want of Provisions they made a desperate sally wherein they kill'd  Mnasippus  with a good Number of his Men At length  Iphicrates  and  Timotheus  coming up with the  Athenian  Fleet took nine of the  Spartan  Gallies and put an end to these Commotions  About the same time the Inhabitants of  Plata√™a  applying to their old Friends the  Athenians  for their Protection and Alliance the  Thebans  took Offence at it and demolish'd the Town and  soon after did the same by  Thespiae  The  Thebans  demolish  Plataea  and  Thespiae  The  A  henians  were so highly incens'd at the Treatment of those two Cities which had deserv'd so well of the common Cause in the  Persian  War that they would act no longer in Conjunction with them and upon their breaking with them the Affairs of  Greece  took a new and unexpected Turn  Athens  and  Sparta  began now to think in earnest of enjoying some Repose themselves  Athens  and  Sparta  incline to Peace  and of giving it to the lesser States whose Quarrels had been promoted chiefly by them and made subservient to their Views of obtaining the Sovereignty of  Greece  This was undoubtedly the true Grounds of their Enmity tho' several other pretended Causes were asign'd of which the most plausible was the settling the other Cities and Republicks in a State of Freedom and Independency This was now in some measure effected and the  Spartans  having been forc'd to give up a great Part of the Power they had unjustly obtain'd the  Athenians  contented themselves with this Mark of their Submission especially since they had recover'd a great Part of what they had lost at Sea which had brought things to a pretty equal Balance The Truth is they had been at almost all the Charge and Hazard of the War exclusive of their Allies so that notwithstanding they had been successful in the main they had been sufficiently drain'd and harass'd and were therefore glad of so  avourable a Conjuncture to renew the former Treaty There  being at the same time nothing to apprehend on the Side of  Asia  where  Artaxerxes  was deeply engag'd in his  Aegyptian  War there was a general Disposition for Peace and the Negotiations were carried on successfully by the  Athenians  but it was rejected by the  Thebans  The  Thebans  aver se to it  and in such a manner as plainly shew'd they were now setting up for themselves and would no longer be consider'd as a subordinate State  They were naturally an hardy and robust People but had the Character of being heavy and stupid even to a Proverb And yet such Generals as  Epaminondas  and  Pelopides  and such Writers as  Pindar  and  Plutarch  one would think should have vindicated them from that Reproach However it is certain they had not hitherto exerted themselves in any Degree suitable to the Fame of their Heroes and Founders who by their Exploits partly Fabulous and partly Historical had given a Promise of what might be expected from their Descendants especially in a City of so great Antiquity and Renown as to have maintain'd a Siege even before that of  Troy  But they were far from answering these Expectations The  Thebans  were divided in Interest from the  Boeotians  during the  Persian  Wars which is assign'd as one Reason why they were so long kept under They basely deserted the common Cause of  Greece  at that Time to join with the  Barbarians  And when contrary to all human Probability that numerous Army was  defeated they apprehended the Power and Resentment of the  Athenians  who as being their Neighbours might under a Pretence of punishing their Treachery possess themselves of their Country This Necessity threw them under the Protection of the  Spartans  who chose rather to forgive the Friends of  Persia  than sacrifice the Enemies of  Athens  and accordingly enter'd into a League with them The  Thebans  were not ungrateful they did them very great Service in the  Peloponnesian  War and continu'd during the whole Course of it their good and faithful Allies Upon what Occasion they afterwards broke with them and were thereupon oblig'd to have Recourse to the  Athenians  has already been related It was a constant Maxim with them as they were deserted by one of those two States to fall in with the other and which Side soever they inclin'd to they were generally of Weight enough to turn the Balance However they had hitherto made no further use of that Weight than to secure themselves But they had been so constantly engag'd of late Years on one Side or the other according to the Exigencies of their Affairs that it had brought them into Discipline and fir'd their Ambition and the  Spartans  had principally contributed to it by their late srequent Expeditions against them It was an establish'd Point of Policy in the  Spartan  Government to avoid engaging too often with the same Enemy for fear of instructing them in  the Art of War And  Lycurgus  had for the same Reason expresly forbid it by his Laws But the Resentment of  Agesilaus  against the  Thebans  carried him on beyond any Consideration of that kind insomuch that finding his Colleague  Cleombrotus  averse to the  Theban  War he lead the Army himself notwithstanding that he had before claim'd the Privilege of his Age to excuse his Attendance And an Action happening wherein he was wounded  Antalcidas  reproach'd him  That he was well requited by the  Thebans  for having taught them to fight  In short they began now to look about them and enlarge their Views and finding themselves too much cramp'd up within their ancient Limits they laid hold of the present Conjuncture to extend their Dominion beginning as the other States had done by little Encroachments on their Neighbours  The Spirit which now appear'd among them  They are encourag'd by  Pelopidas  and  Epaminondas  had been rais'd by  Pelopidas  their late Deliverer from the  Spartan  Yoke and was seconded and supported by  Epaminondas  who tho' he had all the Qualities necessary for the Service of the Publick yet chose to lead a private Life in a constant Course of Virtue and the Study of Philosophy He had seldom appear'd in publick but in order to get himself excus'd from those Employments which were so eagerly courted by others But his extraordinary Merit no longer suffering him to enjoy his Retirement he was forc'd out of it and plac'd at the Head of the  Theban  Army  He had before this contracted an Intimacy with  Pelopidas  which was daily improv'd by the Correspondence of their Tempers and Principles and the ardent Zeal which they both express'd for the Good of their Country And they had upon some Occasions before this Time appear'd together in Action But  Pelopidas  having made a more early Figure in the Army the Success which the  Thebans  had hitherto met with was generally ascrib'd to him However  Epaminondas  had done enough to distinguish himself and they both now came to be consider'd in the same Light as Generals abroad and as Governors at home  When the Treaty propos'd by the  Athenians  was upon the Point of being executed the  Thebans  demanded to be comprehended in it under the Name of the  Boeotians  and to be expresly stiled so But the other contracting Powers would not agree to it  Agesilaus  particularly insisted upon their leaving  Boeotia  free and independent He was answer'd by  Epaminondas  who was there as Ambassador on the Part of the  Thebans That they the  Spartans  would do well to shew them the Example by setting free the Country of  Laconia  for that the Pretensions of the City of  Thebes  to the one were as well founded as those of the City of  Sparta  to the other  He urg'd farther not only in Behalf of the  Thebans  but of  Greece  in general  That  Sparta  had aggrandiz'd herself by War at the Expence of her Neighbours  That Peace might be obtain'd and such a  ne as might be solid and lasting but that it could not be otherwise so than by reducing all to an Equality  These Remonstrances however just they were yet so incens'd  Agesilaus  that he struck the Name of the  Thebans  out of the Treaty  Agesilaus  declares War against the Thebans  and declar'd War against them  The entering into a War in this manner was thought both by the  Spartans  and their Allies too hasty a Step and when it was at last and with some Difficulty decreed by the  Ephori  it was censur'd as an Act more of Passion than Judgment and as owing to the particular Pique  Agesilaus  had to the  Thebans  on whose Account he had been call'd out of  Asia  and thereupon he laid hold of all Opportunities of being reyeng'd on them However he took care at the same time to conclude a Peace with the rest of the  Grecians  tho' it was couch'd in so loose and general Terms as if it were intended only to serve the present Occasion lest any of them should  oin against him and that he might afterwards either observe or break it according as he should find it most for his Purpose This agrees with what he said to the other Ambassadors upon his dismissing them  That what could be amicably adusted should and that what was not otherwise to be remedied must be determin'd by the Sword it being too dissicult a Task to provide for every thing by  reaty  The  Thebans  were by this means left to them  elves and  Cleombrotus  lying then in  Phocis  wit ten thousand Foot and a thousand Horse th  Ephori  sent him Orders to march immediate  into  Boeotia  and at the same time they order' fresh Levies to be made in  Laconia  and amon  their Allies The  Thebans  tho' they were unde  the utmost Consternation and that all  Greece  general look'd upon them as lost prepar'd  stand upon their Defence  Epaminondas  was at  pointed Commander in Chief but there we  join'd with him at his own Request six other  as his Council or Assistants  Cleombrotus  in the mean time pursued h  March with great Diligence and went on  to a certain Victory However when he a  riv'd upon the Frontiers of  Boeotia  he sent un  der colour of justifying his Proceedings to d  mand of the  Thebans That they should restore if  Boeotian  Cities to their Liberty That they shou  rebuild  Plataea  and  Thespiae  which they had don  lish'd in the last War and that they should make g  all the Losses the Inhabitants had sustain'd E  minendas  return'd an Answer suitable to the D  mand  That the  Spartans  had nothing to do wi  Boeotia and  that the  Thebans  were not accom  table to them for their Conduct  There now remain'd nothing further to  done on either Side but to prepare for Actio  But just as the  Thebans  march'd out of the C  they were terrified by Omens and Prodiga  which they interpreted to portend ill Success to  hem  Epaminodas  by way of Encouragement repeated to them a Verse of  Homer  which implied    That there was one sure good  men to those who fought for their Country  One of these unlucky Auguries was a sudden  reat Clap of Thunder which they look'd up  n as a Warning from Heav'n and address'd  hemselves to their General to know his SentiMents upon it But he being more attentive  the Incampment of the  Spartan  Army than  the Thunder gave them no other Answer  han  That be wonder'd to see the Enemy bad  tch'd upon so bad a Piece of Ground when they  ight have posted themselves so much more advan  ageously  However to prevent any further Effets of this Superstition or Fear which was  mong the Troops he found it necessary to hu  our them a little and to take them in their own  ay Accordingly he invented other Counter  mens and Auguries and made use of old  rophecies and Predictions which he applied  the present Occasion and took care to have  hem explain'd in so favourable a manner that he Soldiers went on in full Confidence of Suc  ess and were eager to engage The next  oint in Debate was among the Generals  hether they should act defensively or march  p to the  Spartans  Camp and offer them  attle The Council of War upon this Occasion  consisted of  Epaminondas  and five of  Colleagues and they were equally divided Opinion But  Pelopidas  as some say came afterwards and by his Vote it was determin to give the Enemy Battle Accordingly  two Armies met in the Plain of  Leuctra  Town in  Boeotia  Archidamus  the Son of  Agesilaus  having join the  Spartans  with the new Levies had increas their Number to four and twenty Thousan  whereas the  Thebans  had at the most but  Thousand There was also a great Disproporti  in their Horse But the  Thebans  had vastly  Advantage both in the Quality of their Horse and in their Management of them  Epaminondas  endeavour'd to supply his W  of Troops by his Disposition  A M Olymp  The Batt  of  Leuctra  and by the V  gour of his Attack And taking to himself  Command of the Left Wing opposite to  Right of the Enemy commanded by  Cleomio  tus  he put the main Stress of the Battle the  concluding that is he could break that Body  Spartans  the rest would easily be put to the Ro  With this View he strengthen'd his Wing w  his heavyarm'd Infantry and the best of  other Troops by which Additions it was  M  n deep whereas that of the  Spartans  was b  twelve He closed it with the  Sacred Band  der the Command of  Pelopidas  and his Ho  he placed in the Front of it after the Example of  Cleombrotus  Having drawn off so ma  from his other Wing he order'd those who remain'd in it to fall back in a slanting Line as if they declin'd fighting and were making their Retreat which he did that they might not be left too much expos'd and that they might cover his Flank on the Right and be a Body of Reserve to him in case of need  He then advanc'd with his Wing extending  t obliquely in order to draw off the Right Wing of the  Spartans  from their main Body The Enemy perceiving his Design chang'd their Order of Battle and began to extend their Wing likewise with an Intent to surround  Epa  nondas  But before they could open and close their Divisions he took advantage of their forming themselves and began the Attack with the Horse And  Pelopidas  charging with him at the same time with incredible Speed and Bravery at the Head of his  Battalion  they follow'd she Horse and press'd so hard upon the  Spar  ans  that tho' they were of all the  Grecians  the most expert in recovering any Surprise or Disorder of that Kind their Skill was now quite passed Their Horse being not able to stand the Shock were forc'd back upon their Infantry which by this means was broke and thrown into a good deal of Confusion The  Thebans  having made this Impression with their Horse push'd on to  Cleombrotus  and open'd their Way to him with great Slaughter notwithstanding that the  Spartans  fought with their  wonted Bravery and held the Victory som  Time in Suspence At length  Cleombrotus  with  Dinon Sphodrias  his Son  Cleonyme  and other Officers of Note who came up  defend the Person of their King And  he was kill'd the Fight was renew'd with greater Rage and Obstinacy both to revenge  Death and to recover his Body This la  was a point of Honour with the  Spartan  which they could not for shame give up and  Epaminondas  chose rather to gratify them in it than to hazard the further Success of the Battle Wherefore he left them in possession of their dead King and went on to their other Wing which was commanded by  Archidamus  and consisted chiefly of the Allies who had not willingly been engaged in this Quarrel but were the more easily persuaded to it from the Weakness of the  Thebans  so that they thought they had little more to do than to take the Field and that they were to conquer without fighting or as  Diodorus  expresses it  without Dust But they were so dishearten'd at the Death of  Cleombrotus  and the Defeat of his Wing that they soon betook themselves to Flight and were follow'd by the rest of the Army  Ep  minondas  pursued them with great Slaughter 'till having compleated his Victory he remain'd Master of the Field and erected a Trophy There fell in the Battle four Thousand on the Side of  Sparta  whereof one Thousand were  Lacedamonians  and the Flower of their Army and four Hundred of them were Citizens of  Sparta  The  Thebans  lost in the whole but three Hundred Men  Epaminondas  had succeeded in every Part of this Action according to his Wish and according to the manner in which he had projected it His Skill and Conduct in this Battle and in that which succeeded it at  Manitinea  are look'd upon as Masterpieces in their kind And they who are curious that way may see the exact Plans of them as they are describ'd by a  Le Chevalier de Folard  late Author in his Comments upon  Polybius  This Battle was fought within twenty Days after the Conclusion of the Peace And as it was the sharpest of any that had happen'd during the Wars of the  Grecians  among themselves so it was more remarkable for the Number of the  slain there having seldom been above four or five hundred kill'd on the Side of the vanquish'd even in the Height of the Rivalship between  Athens  and  Sparta  when they fought with the most Rancour and Inveteracy The  Thebans  acquir'd more Glory by it than any of the Republicks had ever gain'd by any single Victory in those Wars And  Epaminondas  felt such a sudden Excess of Joy upon it that he went out of his usual Character and was hardly able to contain himself But the next Day upon cooler Thoughts he resum'd the Philosopher  and appear'd so pensive and melancholy that his Friends were very inquisitive to know the Cause of it He told them  He had suffered himself to be too much transported upon his Victory and that he was now undergoing a proper Chastisement for it  But his Command of himself upon this Occasion did not come up to that of the  Spartans  whose Behaviour after the Battle was so remarkably great that I question whether it can be parallel'd in the History of any Age or Country  If happen'd that when the News of the Defeat came to  Sparta  they were celebrating a Publick Festival in the City where there was a great Concourse of Strangers from several Parts of  Greece  The Behaviour of the  Spartans  after their Defeat  The  Ephori  who from the Accounts they had already received of the Battle could not but be sensible of the terrible Consequences of it yet gave Orders that the Solemnity of the Day should not be interrupted but privately sending the Names of the slain to each Family out of which they were lost they went on with the Sports and Ceremonies as if nothing had happen'd The next Morning when they were more fully informed of the Particulars the Fathers and Relations of the slain came out rejoicing in the Marketplace and saluting each other with a kind of Exultation On the contrary the Fathers of those who survived the Battle conceal'd themselves in their Houses and if any of them were upon any necessary Occasion obliged to  go abroad it was easily discover'd by their Looks that they were asham'd to own their Children The Women carried it still further the Mothers of the slain openly rejoicing chearfully making Visits to each other and assembling in a triumphant manner in the Temples whilst they who expected their Children home sat silent and dejected  But the Generality of the People were awaken'd by this Misfortune and consider'd it as a Blow that they should never be able to recover They began to despair when they found themselves without Troops deserted by their Allies and in a manner at the Mercy of the Conqueror especially when they were further informed that he design'd to invade  Peloponnesus  This occasion'd a general Murmuring and Repining It brought to their Remembrance the former Predictions of the Oracle  That they should suffer under a lame King  They consider'd further that they had given the Crown to this lame King in prejudice to the Right of  Leotychidas  his Nephew But notwithstanding these Reflections and that he had undoubtedly been the sole Author of their present Calamity he had still so much Credit with them that they renew'd the Confidence they they had formerly placed in him and submitted their Affairs entirely to his Determination either as to Peace or War  One great Point under their immediate Consideration was concerning those who had fled out of the Battle They were by the Law in that cafe to be degraded from all Honours and render'd infamous insomuch that it was a Disgrace to intermarry with them They were to appear publickly in mean and dirty Habits with patch'd and partycolour'd Garments and to go halfshav'd and whoever met them in the Streets might insult and beat them and they were not to make any Resistance This was so severe a Law and such Numbers had incurr'd the Penalties of it many of whom were of great Families and Interest that they apprehended the Execution of it might occasion some publick Commotions besides that these Citizens such as they were could very ill be spared at this time when they wanted to recruit the Army Under this Difficulty they gave  Agesilaus  a Power even over the Laws to dispense with them or to abrogate them or to enact such new ones as the present Exigency required He would not abolish or make any Variation in the Law itself but made a publick Declarntion That it should lie dormant for that single Day but revive and be in full Force again on the morrow and by that Expedient he saved the Citizens from Infamy  CHAP IV  From the Battle of Leuctra to the Battle of Mantinea Containing the Space of years  THE Fugitives being thus reinstated in the Army  Agesilaus  made an Inroad into  Arcadia  where he took a small Town belonging to the  Mantineans  and wasted the Territory but avoided engaging in any hazardous Enterprise doing no more at present than what was barely necessary to keep his Men in Action and to revive their Spirits and at the same time to shew that the Fortune of  Sparta  was not quite desperate  The  Thebans  in the mean time were endeavouring to improve their Victory and sent an Herald crown'd with a Garland to communicate it in Form to the  Athenians  and to demand their Assistance But they did not think this a Time to break with  Sparta  they found it a fit Opportunity to make themselves more absolutely Masters at Sea and if they could not carry it further so as to obtain the Sovereignty of  Greece  at least they thought it better to share in it with  Sparta  than to endanger the letting the '  Thebans  into the whole Upon  which Considerations they dismiss'd the Herald without giving him Audience  With these Views  Olymp  The  Athenians  take advanta a of this Overthrow of the  Spartans  they gave the  Spartans  to understand That as they had lost their Power it was expected they should lay aside their Haughtiness and Severity At the same time they took upon themselves to maintain the Peace which by the Deputies of the several Cities assembled at  Athens  they caused to be renew'd and retified in the Name of them and their Confederates The  Thebans  stood out as before and the  Eleans  now followed their Example objecting against the Freedom of several Towns which they pretended to be immediately under their Jurisdiction And several other States afterwards fell in with the  Thebans  Several States side with the  Thebans  some by Compulsion and more out of Inclination and Policy as they found they were most likely to be protected by them  Thebes  was now become the common  Asylum  for those who apprehended the Power of their Neighbours and more particularly of the  Spartans  The  Mantineans  about this time took occasion to rebuild their City  The  Mantineans  rebuild their City  which with the Assistance of the  Eleans  and some Part of the  Arcadians  they perfected and wall'd in as before And according to  Pausanias  the  Arcadians  in general by the Persuasion of  Epaminondas  out of several small Towns built one common City by the Name of  Megalopolis  tho'  Diodorus  places it two years lower upon  their great Overthrow by the  Spartans  Thus far the  Arcadians  had made a right and reasonable use of  Sparta  's being humbled But they and some other States when they found themselves restored according to the Treaty to the free Enjoyment of their own Laws and Forms of Government grew wanton and capricious and fell into such Dissensions among themselves as prov'd of worse Consequence to them than the Dominion of  Sparta  This was the Case of the  Tegeans  who had form'd a Scheme of uniting themselves with all the rest of the  Arcadians  Commotions in  Arcadia  into one Body of a Commonwealth with a General Council consisting of ten Thousand in whom there was to be lodg'd an absolute Power to determine all Matters relating to Peace and War But this Project occasion'd such Factions and Tumults among them that great Numbers were kill'd and above fourteen Hundred banish'd and it ended in bringing the  Spartans  again upon them under the old Pretence of restoring Exiles and in making their Country a Seat of War  Agesilaus  immediately took occasion from these intestine Divisions to send a Body of fifteen Hundred Men among them under the Command of  Polytropus  He possess'd himself of  There was another City of this Name in Boeotia  Orchomenus  A Battle at Orchomenus  which was well affected to  Sparta  and garrison'd it  Lycomedes  the  Arcadian  General  being about three to one stronger march'd up to him and offer'd him Battle under the Walls  Polytropus  accepted it and was kill'd with two hundred of his Men and the rest were forc'd back into the City However  Lycomedes  not doubting but the  Spartans  would come with a greater FoRce to revenge themselves did not think it adviseable to pursue his Victory without some further Assistance Accordingly he applied to the  Athenians  but they refus'd to join with him concluding as they had done before with regard to the  Thebans  that  Sparta  was low enough already and that it would be wrong Policy in them at this time to support any other State against her Hereupon the  Arcadians  had recourse to the  Thebans  who receiv'd them with open Arms and this was a great Addition to the Confederacy that was forming against  Sparta  About the Time of the civil Discord among the  Arcadians  concerning their new Form of Government there happen'd a more grievous Instance of the same kind at  Argos  Sedition at  Argos  where the Government being in the People the Orators or Demagogues as they were more properly call'd ftirt'd them up against the Nobility who to secure themselves against the Insults and Outrages to which they were expos'd enter'd into Conspiracy to destroy the  Democracy  Which being suspected by the Commons they put several to the Rack and extorted  from them a Confession of the whole Design Whereupon they murther'd Thirty of those who were principally concern'd without any Form of Trial And many false Accusations against others were dress'd up and aggravated by these Orators insomuch that there were above sixteen hundred of the greatest and richest Men of the City executed and their Estates confiscated At length the Orators whether they were struck with Remorse for the Cruelties they had oceasion'd or that they were afraid of being at last involv'd in the general Ruin began to slacken in their Prosecutions and the People from thence concluding that they had deserted their Cause murther'd such of them as they could find remaining in the City This was the greatest Massacre that had happen'd in any City of  Greece  and it was distinguished by the Name of  The Seytalism  from the manner in which it was executed by the knocking on the Head with Clubs And this Sedition was a very unlucky Conjuncture for that City which was so rich and powerful that she was in a Condition to dispute the Sovereignty of  Greece  This Opinion was confirm'd by  Jason  who putting in his Claim to it in behalf of the  Thessalians  made use of it as an Argument to them that the  Argives  were too much weaken'd with their intestine Broils to appear as Competitors  This  Jason  had a little Principality at  Pherae  Account of  Jason  of Thessaly  and having ambitious Views and extraordinary Skill in Military Affairs got himself to be declaR'd General of  Thessaly  with which Authority he had gain'd many of the neighbouring Countries into his Alliance and the  Thebans  courted him for his Assistance when they found themselves disappointed of it at  Athens  He appear'd ready to join them with a good Body of Troops but when it came to the Point he diverted them from pursuing their Victory advising them to use it with Moderation and not to make the  Spartans  desperate The  Spartans  on the other hand he persuaded to lie by a little till they had recover'd Breath and could fight upon more advantageous Temrs So that he acted rather as a Mediator than an Ally and there is Mention made of a Truce concluded between them by his Means but the Account of it is so differently related that it does not appear whether it were before or after the Battle of  Leuctra Jason's  Business was to manage so between those States that neither of them might grow too powerful and that he might make his Advantage of it in bringing about his own Designs which by his Mony Art and Eloquence he had in some measure effected But notwithstanding that he was eager in the Pursuit of his Ambition he endeavour'd to save Appearances and to preserve a good Character so that when he had injur'd or molested any of his Neighbours he would say  by way of Excuse  There is a Necessity for those to be unjust in small Matters who will act justly in great Ones  He was at the Head of an Army of ten thousand Horse and twenty thousand heavyarm'd Foot without reckoning the lightarm'd Soldiers And with this Force he might soon have been capable of giving Law to the rest of  Greece  But before he could make any Attempt towards it he was suddenly assassinated at the Instigation of his Brothers  Polydore  and  Polyphron  who jointly succeeded him But the latter kill'd the other and was soon after kill'd himself by his  Some make him his Brother  Nephew  Alexander  under the Pretence of revenging the Death of his Father  Polydore  By this Means  Alexander  possess'd himself of  Pherae  and became very oppressive and tyrannical But as I shall have occasion to mention him more particularly I would here only observe that from the Time of  Jason's  Death the  Thessalians  lost the Influence they had in the Affairs of  Greece  and the Prospect of obtaining the Sovereignty of it in their turn  The  Thebans  in the mean time having besides the late Accession of the  Arcadians  got the  Phocians Locrians Acarnanians Euboeans  and other neighbouring States under their Dependence were preparing to act offensively against the  Spartans  Olymp The  Thebans  act off  nsiverly against  Sparta  and under a Notion of assisting the  Arcadians  against them enter'd  Peloponnesus  where having join'd the  Arcadians  and the rest  of the Confederates they made up an Army  forty some say fifty thousand Men besides grea  Numbers who follow'd the Camp for Plunde  amounting in the whole to seventy thousand  Epaminondas  and  Pelopidas  having the Command of the Army divided it into four Bodies who broke into  Laconia  at four several Parts of it a  the same Time then made a general Rendezvou  at  Sellasia  and pursu'd their March with Fire an  Sword towards  Sparta Agesilous  was at this time in pursuit of the  Arcadians  after the Defeat of  Polytropus  But upon this Approach of the  Thebans  he immediately return'd to  Sparta  where he found the Inhabitants under the utmost Terror and Consternation and the more so because no Enemy had appear'd there in the Course of near six hundred Years since the  Dorians  as Descendants of  Hercules  first got Possession of the Country Hence it was that  Plato  said  The City of  Sparta  was like the  Temple of the Furies  which Nobody bad Courage enough to approach  And it was a frequent Saying of  Agesilaus himself That the Women of  Sparta  had never seen the Smoke of the Enemies Fire  which was now retorted upon him There was another Saying of  Antalicidas  to the same Purpose who being in Dispute with an  Athenian  about the Valour of the two nations the  Athenian  bragg'd  That his Countrymen bad often drove the  Spartans  from the River Cephisus Yes  said Antalcidas  but we never had Occasion to drive you from the Euro  s  But this was not the Case at present For  Epaminondas  at the Head of his Infantry pass'd that River tho' it was then swell'd to an unusual Heighth and tho' the  Spartans  taking that Opportunity to fall upon him cut off a good Number of his Men However he made good his Passage and march'd up to the Suburbs of the City where the Inhabitants were with great Difficulty restrain'd from rushing out in a confus'd and desperate manner upon the Enemy But  Agesilaus  upon this Occasion shew'd more Temper than ordinary he found it necessary to lay aside his Pride and Obstinacy and to play a saving Game He endeavour'd to quiet the Minds of the People so as to keep them within their Bounds and made the best Disposition he could of them for the Defence of the City It was thought proper in this Extrernity to proclaim That as many of the  Helots  as would enlift and form themselves into Companies should receive their Freedom and a thousand of them accepted the Offer  Xenophon  says six thousand which is not very improbable from the Circumstance he adds that when they were arm'd in a Body they made so formidable an Appearance that the  Spartans  themselves durst not trust them without placing a good Number of Mercenaries and other Troops as a Guard upon them  The  Thebans  being thus far advanc'd made a sort of Encampment near the City and endeavour'd to draw the  Spartans  out of it in order to a  pitch'd Battle But  Agesilaus  had retir'd to an E  minence in the Heart of the Town and intended nothing more than the Defence of it Hereupon they resolv'd to attack it and endeavour'd to tak  it by Storm  And attempt to take the City by Storm  but they found the Avenues so wel secured that they met with more Difficulty that they expected When at length they made at Irruption with their Horse the  Spartan  Horse oppos'd them and a Party of three hundred Foot who lay in Ambuscade sallying out upo  them at the same time  But are repuls'd  they were repuls'd with considerable Loss and discourag'd from making a second Attempt They contented themselves with encamping again without the City where they bid Defiance to the  Spartans  and challeng'd them to come out and give them Battle to which they return'd a very cool Answer  That they would not decline it when they saw a prop  Occasion  Then they reproach'd  Agesilaus  by Name as the Incendiary of the War and the Author of all the Mischief done to his Country But he resolv'd not to be provok'd he overlook'd all these personal Insults and Reflections as the Effects of Rage and Disappointment and would not suffer himself to be diverted from the only Point he had then in view which was the Security of the City and the Preservation of it at this Time was no less owing to this Command of himself than to his good Conduct in other Respects  The Behaviour of Ischolas the  Spartan  upon this Occasion  Behaviour of  Ischolas  deserves particular Notice He commanded one of the Detachments which were order'd out to secure the most important Passes but finding it too weak to stand the Attack of the Enemy he pick'd out the youngest of the Men and sent them back as a Reserve for the future Service of their Country and with the rest devoting himself after the Example of  Leonidas  to the publick Good he made a long and obstinate Defence and fought till they were all kill'd to a Man The  Thebans  proposing nothing further to themselves there decamp'd and after having plunder'd and laid waste all the Country return'd into  Arcadia  This Expedition had not answer'd the great Preparations that were made for it  Epaminondas  resoures the Messenians  But  Epaminondas  to make it the more memorable propos'd the restoring the Posterity of the old  Messeniens  who had near three hundred Years before been driven out by the  Spartans  and were settled in  Sicily Italy  and other Parts where they retain'd their ancient Customs and Manners and the  Dorick  Dialect By a general Consent of his Allies he invited them home to their native Country and their City was immediately rebuilt and peopled so that in a few Months it recover'd its former State and Grandeur and a strong Garrison was lest for its Defence The Territory was likewise divided by Lot among the new Inhabitants The resettling a People  who had made so considerable a Figure in to early Times of  Greece  did highly redound to th  Honour of  Epaminondas  and was a fresh Di  grace to the  Spartans  for having tamely suffer  the Loss of a Country of as large Extent as the own and the most fertile of any in  Greece  besides that they had been so long in Possession of it and held it as a Barrier against any Inv  sion on that Side And  Agesilaus  was so piqu'd  it that he made it the Grounds of continuing the War with the  Thebans  when they offer'd him Peace and the Consequence of his Refusal was that it very near occasion'd the Loss of  Spark  itself  The  Thebans  in their Return home met with some Opposition from  Iphicrates  who had been sent with twelve thousand  Athenians  to assist the  Spartans  in their Extremity but having loiter'd at  Corinth  he did not come up till the Business was over And afterwards he omitted to secure an important Pass call'd  Cenchreae  which would have given them a great deal of Disturbance in their Retreat His Conduct throughout in this Affair was blam'd which was the more remarkable in him because he never misbehav'd upon any other Occasion  Epaminondas  and  Pelopidas  Epaminondas  and  Pelopidas  imprison'd at their Return  at their Return to  Thebes  instead of receiving the Acknowledgements due to their Services were clap'd up as State Prisoners for having continu'd in their Command four Months longer than the Time  dimited by Law which took in almost the Whole of this Expedition from their first Entrance into  Peloponnesus  And as the Crime was Capital they were tried for it They had nothing to alledge in their Excuse for so manifest a Violation of the Law but the Advantages they had obtain'd for their Country so that they confess'd the Charge and submitted themselves to their Judges Their Enemies had used great Art and Industry to in  cense the People against them Which  Epaminondas  perceiving and that they were ready to pass Sentence of Death against him reminded them of the Battle of  Leuctra  and his other Exploits by which he had saved his Country and restor'd the Liberty of  Greece  And he made it his Request to have it inscrib'd upon his Tomb  stone  That for those Services he was punish'd with Death  This manner of reproaching them had so good an Effect that they were asham'd to proceed any further against him  They are tried and acquitted  and he was honourably acquitted as was likewise  Pelopidas  who being of a warmer Temper and spirited up by his Friends express'd his Resentment of this Usage and reveng'd himself upon  Meneclides  who was at the Bottom of this Prosecution and was a very able Speaker but loose in his Manners illnatur'd perverse and envious he was one of those who met at  Charon  's House upon the affair of the  Cadmea  and not thinking himself consider'd enough for his Share in that  Enterprize made it his Business upon all Occasions to accuse and calumniate his Superiors Even after the Trial he prevail'd so far as to get  Epaminondas  excluded for a Year from the Government of  Boeotia  But  Pelopidas  being more a Favourite with the People he went another way to work and endeavour'd to supplant him by setting up  Charon  against him which he contriv'd in the following manner There was a famous Painter of  Cyzicus  employ'd at  Thebes  in drawing a Battle but was forc'd away by the Revolt there before he had put the last Hand to it However the Picture remaining in the City  Meneclides  propos'd the hanging it up in some publick Place with an Inscription to perpetuate the Memory of a Victory obtain'd by  Charon  at  Plataea  tho' it was in reality no more than a Skirmish wherein forty  Spartan  were kill'd This Action happen'd a little before the Battle of  Leuctra  and the magnifying it in this manner was plainly with a Design to eclipse the Glory of that Day and to throw a Slurupon the two Generals who commanded  Pelepidas  therefore oppos'd the Motion which yet he did with great Art and Decency with regard to  Charon  to whom he gave all due Praise but at the same time he expos'd the Absurdity of the Proposal and the Malice and Impertinence of the Author of it which the People being sensible of laid so heavy a Fine upon him that  he was not able to pay it and from thenceforward he grew a common Disturber of the Government  But to return to the  Spartans  they had unexpectedly got rid of a very formidable Enemy But the Terror and Confusion they had been in the Sense of the Losses they had sustain'd and their Apprehensions of what further might happen  Cabals and Conspiracies in Sparta  had created a great deal of ill Blood among them and raised such a Spirit of murmuring and caballing against the Government that  Agesilaus  found it almost as difficult a Task to manage the People in the City as to keep the Enemy out of it  The Means by which  Agesilaus  suppress'd them  There was an Instance of this kind wherein he shew'd extraordinary Address and Presence of Mind Two hundred Malecontents had got into a strong Part of the Town call'd  Issorion  where they had seized the Temple of  Diana Agesilaus  would not employ Force against them not knowing how deep the Plot might be laid and how far it might spread but went muffled up in his Cloak with only one Servant and being come near the Rebels call'd out and told them  You have mistaken my Orders my Directions were not that you should all go in a Body to that Station but some of you should plant yourselves there and others there  at the same time pointing out to them different Parts of the City They went off accordingly without the least Suspicion to the Places which he mark'd  out to them and immediately upon their being thus dispers'd he order'd some of the Troops to possess themselves of that Post and caused about fifteen of the Conspirators to be apprehended and they were put to death the Night following This Conspiracy was follow'd by another of more dangerous Consequence wherein a great Number of the Citizens were engaged and had private Consultations every Night how to introduce a Change in the Government They were so strong a Party that it was neither safe to prosecute them publickly according to Law nor to let them go on and connive at them Wherefore  Agesilaus  took another course and with the Consent of the  Ephori  put them to death privately without Process which had never before been practised in  Sparta  But the present Exigency of Affairs seem'd to make it necessary for these Seditions happen'd about the Time of the  Theban  Expedition And to add to the Consternation the City was then under many of the  Helots  and Mercenaries at the same time deserted to the Enemy  But the  Spartans  having got over these domestick Difficulties and repuls'd the  Thebans  began now to look abroad and provide for their future Security They had got together a good Body of Auxiliaries from  Corinth  and other Parts of  Peloponnesus  But their chief Dependence was on the  Athenians  to whom they  had formally given up the Command at Sea in order to fix them in their Interest but they were not so sanguine in it as was expected so that what they did was rather to keep the  Thebans  under  The Command divided equally between  Athens  and  Sparta  than to assist the  Spartans  They now insisted on being upon the same Footing with them both at Sea and Land which they call'd Treating upon equal Terms And since nothing less would content them it was accordingly agreed that each State should command five Days alternately  This Agreement was no sooner made  The  Arcadians  renew the War  but the  Arcadians  renew'd the War They took  Pallene  in  Laconia  by Storm where they put above three hundred  Spartans  in Garrison to the Sword  Olymp    and ravag'd the Country After which they were join'd by the  Argives  and  Eleans  and the  Thebans  sent  Epaminodas  again to them with seven thousand Foot and five hundred Horse The  Athenians  being now in earnest sent  Chabrias  to oppose his Passage He join'd the  Spartans  with their Allies at  Corinth  where they made up an Army of twenty thousand Men to which there was afterwards an Addition of two thousand from  Sicily  who did good Service  Epaminondas  came up to force his Passage as he had done before into  Peloponnesus  but finding it shut up with a Wall and a deep Interechment across the  Isthmus  as at the Time of the Invasion by  Xerxes  he endeavour'd to draw the Enemy out into the Field which they declin'd  altho' they were near three times his number Whereupon he survey'd the Works and finding one Part where the  Spartans  were posted weaker than the rest he chose to make his main Attack there  Epaminondas  again invades  Peloponnesus  which he did with such Resolution and Bravery that after a very hot Dispute on both Sides he open'd the Passage and harass'd the Country  Sicyon  and some other Places having submitted to him  and assaults  Corinth  he pursu'd his March to  Corinth  where after some skirmishing he came up with his whole Strength and made so vigorous an Assault that the Inhabitants were in the utmost Despair  But is repulsed by  Chabrias  But  Chabrias  came out and stood the Shock and by the Advantage of the Ground and the constant fresh Supplies which he receiv'd from the City repuls'd the Enemy with great Loss whereupon they not only retreated from  Corinth  but quitted  Peloponnesus  And the Honour of this Defence was almost entirely owing to  Chabrias  Epaminodas  by one Part of his Conduct in this Expedition incurr'd the Displeasure of the State For notwithstanding his Bravery in forcing the Pass that was defended by the  Spartans  he was suspected of Partiality towards them for not having pursu'd and slaughter'd them when they were judg'd to be in his Power His Enemies aggravating the Matter and making it a Charge of Treachery got him turn'd out of the Government of  Boeotia  and reduc'd to the Condition of a private Man This Accusation was not  thought to be well founded enough for so severe a Censure However an Occasion offer'd soon after wherein his Service was so seasonable and so important that he easily wip'd off the Aspersion  It does not appear what Effect the dividing the Command between  Athens  and  Sparta  had upon this Invasion however it produc'd one good Consequence as it serv'd to weaken the Confederacy against them For it was now made use of as a Precedent by the  Arcadians  who were grown so elated with their Successes and put such a Value upon their Services against  Sparta  that they disdain'd to act any longer in Subordination to the  Thebans  This Spirit was rais'd in them by  Lycomedes  of  Mantinea  The  Arcadians  spirited up by  Lycomedes  who had been their General in most of their late Expeditions He was of great Birth and Fortune and being ambitious withal represented to them That the whole Country of  Peloponnesus  belong'd properly to them as the first ancient Inhabitants That they were the most numerous of any People in  Greece  and so stout and powerful that they had always been consider'd in the first Rank of Auxiliaries insomuch that the  Spartans  had never done any thing against  Athens  without them nor had the  Thebans  now appear'd against  Sparta  if they had not supported them That as they had formerly advanc'd the Affairs of the  Spartans  they were now doing the same for the  Thebans  and that in short if they did not insist upon  commanding in their Turn with them they might in the End find them  Spartans  too He had so inflam'd them with these Remonstrances and gain'd such an entire Credit with them that they easily agreed to every thing he propos'd and there was nothing so difficult that they were not ready to undertake This created a great Coldness and Jealousy on the Part of the  Thebans  And the  Eleans  at the same time were inclin'd to break with the  Arcadians  for refusing to deliver up to them some of their Towns which had been taken by the  Spartans  Whilst these Disputes were on foot  Fresh Overtures of Peace  the King of  Persia  sent to manage the Renewal of the Peace among the  Grecians  that they might be able to spare him such Succours as he had occasion for The chief Point in debate was the restoring  Messene  to the  Spartans  which the  Thebans  not agreeing to the Negotiations broke off and  Philiscus  of  Abydus  who was employ'd on the Part of the  Persians  return'd into  Asia  having left behind him two thousand Mercenaries with Mony to pay them for the Service of the  Spartans  At the same time they receiv'd a second Supply of two thousand Men from  Sicily  Agesilaus  on account of his Age got the Command of the Army transferr'd to his Son  Archidamus  who march'd against the  Arcadians  and in Return for what they had done the last Year in  Laconia  strom'd a Town call'd  Caryae  and  put the Garrison to the Sword from whence he proceeded to  Parrhasia  and destroy'd the Country about it The  Sicilian  Troops being now upon their Return home were intercepted by the  Messenians  and  Archidamus  coming up to their Relief was oppos'd by the  Arcadians  and  Argives  A signal Victory of the Spartans  but he charge'd them so furiously that he broke them at once and gain'd a Victory not easily to be accounted for It is said there fell above ten thousand of the Enemy without the Loss of one single Man on the Side of the  Spartans  and hence it was distinguish'd by the Name of  The Tearless Battle  The Joy upon the Arrival of the News at  Sparta  was so great that the People were not able to contain themselves This was the first remarkable Success they had met with since their Defeat at  Leuctra  which had made such an Impression on them that it is said  The Men were ever since asham'd to look their Wives in the Face  But this had given 'em new Life they went in Crouds to the Banks of the  Eurotas  full of Praise and Thanksgiving to the Gods as having wash'd off the Stain of that Action and restor'd their City to its ancient Splendor  Plutarch  remarks That this Excess of Joy too plainly discover'd the present Weakness of  Sparta  for that Victory was formerly so common to them that it was look'd upon as a thing of course The Soldiers did not boast of it nor were the Citizens exalted upon it so that in the most extraordinary Case they seldom sacrificed  any thing more than a Cock and the Messenger who brought them the News of a signal Victory at  Mantinea  in the time of the  Pel  ponnesian  War had no other Reward than a Piece of Salt Meat But this was re  an the  manner insomuch that the old King himself went out in Procession to meet and embr  ce his Son and was attended by the  Epheri  and the whole Senate and all with Tears of Joy in their Eyes  The  Thebans  and  Eleans  were far from being displea  'd at this Disaster which the  Arcadians  had brought upon themselves by their is  tim'd Vanity and Arrogance And this Defeat of them was follow'd by a further Train of Misfortunes  The  Thebens  in the mean time were daily increasing in Power  The  Thebans  increase in Power  which gave them great Credit and Influence among their Neighbours and  Pelopidas  was chiesly instrumental in it They were become Modeators of the Quarrels about the Succession in  Macedonia  where they had compos'd the Differences in the Royal Family and taken as Hostages at one time thirty and afterwards fifty young Men of the chief Families and with the former the King's Brother who was afterwards known by the Name of  Philip  of  Macedon  and Father of  Alexander the Great  They were likewise applied to by the  Thessalians  for Protection against the Tyranny of  Alexander  the  Pherean  whereupon  Pelopidas  was sent  as Ambassador to expostulate with him and bring him to Reason Upon his Return from  Macedonia  he went to  Pharsalus  in  Thessaly  in order to revenge the Treachery of some Mercenary Troops who had deserted him in that Expedition He was no sooner arriv'd there but  Alexander  appear'd before the Place with a great Army  Pelopidas  had but a few  Thessalian  Troops with him and imagining that  Alexander  came thither to justify himself and answer the Complaints that were made against him he and  Is  menias  who was join'd in Commission with him went alone and unarm'd to him not doubting but the Power and Authority of  Thebes  with their own personal Reputation and the publick Character with which they were invested would protect them against any Violence But the Tyrant finding them in his Power  P  lopidas  and I smeni  impris  n'd by  Alexander  of Pherae  seiz'd 'em and sent them Prisoners to  Pherae Polybius  calls  it an unpardonable Act of Imprudence and Rashness in  Pelopidas  to trust himself so far to one whom he knew to be so wicked and perfidious  Alexander  at first permitted every Body to see him with an Intent by making him a publick Spectacle to break his Spirit and humble him But it had a different Effect He sent to tell him in Defiance  That it was absurd in him daily to terment and put to Death so many innocent worthy Citizens and to spare him who he knew if ever he escaped out of his Hands would certainly make him suffer the Punishment due to his Crimes  The Tyrant surpris'd at his Intrepidity answer'd  Why is  Pelopidas  in so much baste to die  Which being reported to him he sent him this Reply  It is that thou may'st perish so much the sooner by becoming still more hateful to Gods and Men  From that time  Alexander  allow'd nobody to see or discourse with him but  Thebe  his Wife whose Curiosity was rais'd by the Account his Keepers had given her of his Behaviour Assoon as she was admitted to him she fell a weeping and said  I pity your Wife And I you  said he  who can bear with  Alexander  when you are not his Prisoner  This Reply affected her nearly and rous'd in her such a Sense of her Husband's ill Usge of her that she repeated her Visits to  Pelopidas  and complain'd freely to him of the many Outrages she had receiv'd He was not wanting on his Part to incense her still more against him till by Degrees he had work'd her up to the highest pitch of Hatred and Resentment These frequent Interviews had very much the Appearance of a Love Affair which she had chiefly promoted But there is no real Foundation to say that she went any further than to compassionate his Sufferings and to communicate her own in order to revenge them which accordingly she some time after accomplish'd  The  Thebans  resenting this Insult upon the Person of their Ambassador  The The  ans resent it  immediately sent an Army into  Thessaly  but the Generals through  ill Fortune or ill Conduct being not able to effect any thing were forc'd to retire  Alexander  pursuing them great Numbers of their Men were kill'd and it was owing to  Epaminondas  that the rest of them were not totally defeated He was at this time in Disgrace with the Government the Reason whereof has before been related and therefore he had no Command in this Expedition but serv'd as a common Soldier However when the Troops found themselves under these Difficulties which they attributed to the Incapacity of their Officers they oblig'd him to take upon him the Command He took the Horse and lightarm'd Foot and posting himself in the Rear repell'd and charg'd the Enemy by turns till he made good the Retreat The  Thebans  upon the Return of the Generals fin'd each of them ten thousand  Drachmas  and soon after sent  Epaminondas  in their room to repair this Dishonour and prosecute their Revenge  Alexander  was very much terrified at his second Arrival But he preserring the Safety of  Pelopidas  to all other Considerations avoided pushing things to an Extremity for fear of making him desperate so as turn all his Fury against his Prisoner and therefore lay hovering about with his Army so as to keep him in awe and yet give him an Opportunity of offering Satisfaction which had the Effect he propos'd He thought it too dishonourable a Part to enter into a Treaty of Alliance with one who was  look'd upon as a Monster of Mankind But granted a Truce of thirty Days in which tin having recover'd  Pelopidas  and  Ismenias  out his Hands  Pelopidas and Ismenias releas'd by Epaminondas  he withdrew his Forces He co  ducted the whole of this Affair with so muc  Courage and Capacity on the one hand and  much Prudence and Temper on the other th  it intirely restor'd him to the Favour and goo Opinion of his FellowCitizens and his generon  Behaviour in overlooking their unjust Resent  ment against him was not the least Part of hi  Praise in it  Pelopidas  notwithstanding this Accident ha  in the main been very successful in these Foreign Transactions and he had rais'd such an Opinion of the Justice and Integrity of the  Thebans  as well as of their Valour that they were easily tempted to pursue their Design of obtaining the Sovereignty of  Greece  The  Thebans  pursue their Design of obtaining the Sovereiguty of Greece  But finding they could not compass it by their Confederates at home they had recourse to  Persia  And they had now a good Pretence for it for the  Spartans  had before sent one thither to treat on their purt Whereupon the  Thebans  proposed it to their Confederates as expedient that each of them should depute some proper Person to assist there likewise in order to support their respective Interests Accordingly the  Arcadians Eleans  and  Argives  consented to it and  Pelopidas  was named on behalf of the  Thebans  which the  Athenians  being inform'd of  appointed Two on their part also But this was a Proof how much they were degenerated from the Virtue of their Ancestors For whatever mean Applications had before been made to the  Persians  by particular Persons or States there had been no Instance of a of a Congress of this kind where by a general Consent all the leading States of  Greece  were by their Representatives assembled in Form to discuss and settle their Demands on each other at the Court of  Persia  But this was the Case at present and the  Spartans  had chiefly contributed to it by the Peace of  Antalcidas  which had prepared the  Grecians  in general to receive the Yoke and to govern themselves according to the Edicts of that King whose Predecessors had been so shamefully bafled in their Attempts against them and who himself was so lately distress'd by those very  Spartans  when  Agesilaus  was ravaging in the Heart of his Empire  Pelopidas  being arrived with the other Ambassadors in  Persia  Negotiati ous in  Persia  so far ingratiated himself by his Address and the Fame of his Exploits that he was particularly distinguish'd from the rest of them and the King received him with most extraordinary Marks of Honour and Esteem He represented to him at his Audience That the  Thebans  had constantly from the Batt  e of  Plataea  to this present time adhered to the Crown of  Persia  and that the  Spartans  had  broke with them purely because they refused to join with them against him From thence he took occasion to mention their success at  Leuctra  with their invading  Laconia  and intimated that the late Overthrow of the  Arcadians  and  Argives  was owing to their not having been assisted by them The King was so well pleased with his Person and Discourse and was so well affected to the  Thebans  as the People on whom he could best depend that he readily granted his Demands The Substance whereof was  That the Liberty formerly granted to all the Towns should be confirmed That  Messene  in particular should remain free from the Jurisdiction of the  Spartans  That the  Athenians  should lay up their Fleet  and  that the  Thebans  should be look'd upon as the ancient heredilary Friends and Allies of  Persia  Pelopidas  gain'd great Credit by this Negotiation And the  Thebans  upon his return expecting to receive the Benefit of it caus'd the Deputies of all the Towns to be assembled at  Thebes  in order to their ratifying the Treaty But when the Oath for confirming it was tender'd to them they said  They came to hear the Articles read not to swear to them which they could not do without consulting their Principals  And  Lycomedes  objected in behalf of the  Arcadians  to the Place of their Meeting which he said ought to be where the Seat of the War was This Method not taking  effect the Cities were applied to separtely in hopes by that means to awe them into a Compliance But the  Corinthians  said plainly  They did not see any Occasion there was for the Treaty  and others following their Example nothing further was done in it so that the  Thebans  were all at once disappointed in their Views and  Artaxerxes  left them as he found them without engaging himself any further in their behalf which indeed he could not do at this time without arming the rest of  Greece  against him For his Partiality to the  Thebans  was now no less visible than the Designs of the  Thebans  themselves who had rais'd so much Jealousy by what they had already done that there was a general Disposition to unite against them and to make it a  Common Cause  The  Athenians  were particularly disgusted by that Article of the Treaty which was to restrain their Power at Sea and they shew'd their Resentment by putting to death  Timagoras  one of their Ambassadors upon his Return from  Persia  He was charged with having taken part with  Pelopidas  and not having acted in concert with his Colleague And as he was next to  Pelopidas  in favour with the King and had received rich Presents from him it was taken for granted that he had betray'd the Interests of his Country  The  Thebans  would not yet give over their Designs but finding they could not manage  the  Arcadians  Olymp  the  Theban  create fresh Disturbances in Peloponnesus  and the other  Pelopannesian  A lies to their Purpose endeavor'd to reduce ther  by means of their Neighbours the  Achaean  who had not yet taken any Part in the Qua  rel  Epaminondas  appearing as an Enemy among these latter they easily submitted to him and enter'd into an Engagement to act in Al  liance with him By which means the  Arca  dians  being distress'd on one Side by the  Achaans  and on the other by the  Spartans  made their Complaints of this Usage at  Thebes  and from hence arose fresh Commotions and Animosities in several Parts of  Peloponnesus  but not considerable enough to be particularly related The most remarkable Effects of them were at  Sicyon  Account of  E  ph  n  of S  cyon  where  Euphron  a Man of great Power took this Occasion to erect a Tyranny under colour of placing the Government in the People He had a natural Interest among the  Spartans  and cultivated the same with their Enemies and manag'd so on all Sides by betraying and sacrificing one Party to the other and by murthering and banishing the chief of the Magistrates and Nobility that he obtain'd his Ends and supported himself for some time 'till the People were afterwards divided against him and he was murther'd at  Thebes  by a Party of those whom he had banished  They who suffer'd most by these Disturbances were the  Phliasians  who were very much exposed by their Situation among the  Theban  Allies  Euphron  not only attack'd them himself but drew the whole Body of  Arcadians  and  Argives  upon them by whom they must have been swallow'd up if they had not been timely relieved by the  Athenians  under the Conduct of  Chares  But they had first undergone a Siege and made a vigorous Defence far beyond what could have been expected from a small City surrounded with so powerful Enemies The chief Quarrel against them was their steady Adherence to the  Spartans  for whose Sakes they had often been reduced to the greatest Streights and Necessities and yet never could be prevail'd upon from their first engaging with them to abandon their Interests insomuch that their Honour and Fidelity in this respect is said to be without Precedent  The  Athenians  had drawn a good deal of Work upon their Hands in supporting this little State and being dissatisfied that none of their Allies had assisted them in it the  Arcadians  took this Opportunity to propose an Alliance with them  A League between the Athenians and Arcadians  It was debated among them whether the accepting it were consistent with their Engagements to  Sparta  But it being consider'd as of equal Advantage to both States that the  Arcadians  should be drawn off from the  Thebans  the Treaty was concluded however it was so qualified that the  Athenians  were to assist the  Arcadians  with a Body of Horse  in case they were invaded without being obliged to join in the Invasion of  Laconia  This Treaty was set on foot and negotiated by  Lycomedes  Lycomedes  vrther'd  who soon after upon his Return from  Athens  was murther'd by a Party of Exiles He was a Man of great Designs and good Execution but had engaged his Countrymen in perpetual Quarrels to support his own Ambition and was undoubtedly the Author of all their late Misfortunes  The  Athenians  upon this new Accession acted a treacherous Part against  Corinth  which they were endeavouring to possess themselves of even whilst they had garrison'd it with their own Troops as Protectors and Allies But the  Corinthians  having notice of their Design immediately drew all the  Athenians  out of their Garrisons and discharg'd them  Chares  at the same time came up with his Fleet under colour of assisting them to compose Matters in the City They thank'd him for the Offer of his Service but would not trust him so far as to admit him into their Harbour These Proceedings dissolved the Alliance between the two States  The Alliance dissolv'd between  Athens  and  Corinth  and were a kind of Declaration of War on both Sides Whereupon the  Corinthians  thought it necessary to secure themselves by a Peace with the  Thebans  and requested of the  Spartans  to give their Consent to it which they readily granted not only to them but to all such others of their Consederates as desir'd it but declared at the same time that for  their own Part they would never lay down their Arms 'till  Messenia  should be restored to them in the Condition they received it from their Ancestors However the  Corinthians  with the  Phliasians  and some others concluded a Peace with the  Thebans  upon Condition  That every one should enjoy their own Artaxerxes  at the same time sent as a Mediator to settle once more the Tranquillity of  Greece  and prevail'd so far that all Parties and even the  Spartans  themselves were quiet for the present And this was call'd putting an end to the  Laconick  or  Boeotian  War  Olymp  A general Peace  after it had continued above five Years from the Battle of  Leuctra  There is a Disagreement among the Historians of this time concerning the Date of some of the principal Events betwen the Battle of  Leuctra  and this Peace but all the Occurrences which have been here related are generally allow'd to have happen'd within the Compass of these five Years  This last Treaty had no more than the Name and Appearance of a Peace which according to the present Situation of Affairs was not likely to be sincere or of any long Continuance The growing Power of  Thebes  could not but necessarily keep up the other Great States in Arms against her and the Lesser ones were so involv'd  Olymp  But is brole the next Year  either as Accessaries in their Quarrels or as Principals in their own that the very next Year fresh Disturbances broke out  The Flame was first kindled between the  Arcadians  and  Eleans  who had long contested their Right to  Triphylia  which belong'd properly to the latter and both Sides according to the Fortune of their Arms held possession of it by turns The  Eleans  being worsted upon this Occasion call'd upon the  Spartans  for Assistance and the  Arcadians  being supported by the  Athenians  harass'd the Country of  Elis  and took several Towns  In the Year following  Olymp    they encourag'd the  Pisaeans  upon some old fabulous pretence to claim a right of presiding at the  Olympick Games  and they accordingly took upon them to manage the Solemnity The  Eleans  to whom this Honour did undoubtedly belong resolved not to give it up  The  Eleans  defeat the  Arcadians  and  Argives    In the midst of the Exercises they fell upon the  Arcadians  with their whole Strength and with such Fury and Intrepidity that they soon routed them and then deseated a Body of two thousand  Argives  but being at length overpower'd retreated back to their City tho' with great Honour and Applause from the People who were conven'd from all parts of  Greece  to the Festival and during this Action stood as Spectators with their Crowns on their Heads The Behaviour of the  Eleans  upon this Occasion was the more remarkable because they had a very low Reputation for Arms and had done nothing like it before However the  Pisaeans  remaining  Conquerors went on with the Sports But the  Eleans  would not allow this  Olympiad  to have been duly celebrated or to be register'd in their Annals  Epaminodas  during these Transactions was wholly intent upon advancing the Honour of his Countrymen  Attempt of  Epaminondas  to gain the Dominion at Sea for the  Thebans  and proposed to them to try for the Dominion at Sea which he told them they might easily obtain as they were Sovereigns at Land And as a Proof of it he instanced in the Case of the  Spartans  who in the War with  Xerxes  had but ten Ships at Sea and yet had the Command over the  Athenians  who had two hundred The People came into his Proposal and having immediately order'd Preparations to be made for fitting out an hundred Gallies sent him to  Rhodes Chios  and  Byzantium  to solicite the Assistance of those Places and to fix them further in their Interest Which he easily effected notwithstanding that the  Athenians  had sent out a strong Squadron under the Command of  Laches  to oppose him But whatever Schemes of this kind they had formed they were diverted from pursuing them by the Part they took in the Quarrels among their Neighbours And the Death of  Epaminondas  happening soon after they lost the only Opportunity they ever had of becoming powerful at Sea  Whilst he was negotiating these Matters abroad some of the  Theban  Fugitives join'd  with the  Orchomenians  A Design to change the Government of Thebes  in a Design to change the Government of  Thebes  into an  Aristocracy  which being discover'd three hundred  Orchomenian  Horsemen who were to have put it in Execution were seized by Order of the  Theban  Magistrates and condemn'd to death They then sent a sufficient Force against  Orchomenus  where the Men were all put to the Sword the Women and Children sold for Slaves and the City razed to the Ground This was look'd upon as an Act of Cruelty not common among the  Grecians  and such as would not have happen'd if either  Epaminondas  or  Pelopidas  had been present They had always shewn great Humanity to those who were in their Power having never spilt the Blood of any Man they had conquer'd or deprived any City of its Liberty after they had taken it  The  Thessalians  still groaning under the Tyranny and Oppression of  Alexander  the  Pherean  took up Arms against him but being worsted in several Battles they begg'd Assistance of the  Thebans  who order'd seven thousand Men un  er the Command of  Pelopidas  Pelopidas  sent against  Alexander  of  Pherae  to their Relief But just as he was ready to march there happen'd a great Eclipse of the Sun from which the People according to the Ignorance and Superstition of the Times apprehended such strange Effects that  Pelopidas  thought it not adviseable to proceed with so great a Number of his Countrymen against the general  Opinion that the Expedition would prove fatal As to himself he was not at all moved at this  Phaenomenon  altho' he was supposed to be principally affected by it For the  Augurs  had made it portend his Death considering him as the  Sun  of  Thebes  that was to be eclipsed However he resolv'd to go on and march'd out with only three hundred Horsemen who attended him as Voluntiers and having join'd the  Thessalians  he encamp'd in the Face of the Enemy who was far superior to him in Numbers having an Army of above twenty thousand Men  The Battle at  Cynoscephalae  Near a Place call'd  Cynoscephalae  there were two Hills opposite to each other in the midst of the Plain and both Sides endeavour'd to get possession of them with their Foot  Pelopidas  at the same time order'd his Cavalry to charge that of the Enemy which he soon routed and pursued over the Plain But  Alexander  having gain'd the Hills and doing great Execution upon the  Thessalians  who attempted to force those Ascents  Pelopidas  was obliged to give over his Pursuit and march up to their Relief which so animated them that after two or three Charges the Enemy began to fall into Disorder and give way which  Pelopidas  perceiving cast his Eyes about in search of  Alexander  and having at length discover'd him in the right Wing rallying and encouraging his Men he was so inflamed at the Sight that he advanced before his Soldiers  crying out and challenging the Tyrant who retreated and shelter'd himself in the Ranks  Pelopidas  there upon grew desperate and charg'd the Enemy a  r  h great Numbers whereof as they advanc'd forwards he cut down with his own Hand But others at a distance shot through his Armour and wounded him and then they stabb'd him in the Breast with their Spears  Pelopidas  kill'd  The  Thessalians  seeing him in this Danger hasten'd down from the H  lls to his Assistance but came too late to save him However to revenge his Death they attack'd the Enemy so vigorously both with their Horse and Foot that they intirely routed them and kill'd above three thousand in the Pursuit And yet did they not look upon it as a Victory or think that any Success could compensate the Loss of their General The  Thebans  who were then present lamented over him in the tenderest and most affectionate manner calling him  Their Father Saviour  and  Instructor in every thing that was great and excellent  The  Thessalians  and other Allies not only sympathiz'd but vy'd with them in expressing their Concern and doing Honour to his Memory And the whole Army was so affected that they neither put off their Armour nor unbridled their Horses nor even dress'd their Wounds but ran to him and heap'd up the Spo  ls of the Enemy about his dead Body they cut off their Horses Manes and their  own Hair and such as retired to their Tents neither kindled a Fire nor took any kind of Refreshment In all the Cities through which the Body pass'd it was attended by the Magistrates with the Priests and Inhabitants car  ying Trophies Crowns and golden Armour After which the  Thessalians  begg'd it as a singular Favour of the  Thebans  that they might bury him and in the most pathetick Terms urg'd it as a sort of Right due to them as the greatest Sufferers  You indeed  said they  have lost a great General and in that we share in common with you But we have likewise lost in him all the Hopes of recovering our Liberty and under this heavy Misfortune our paying the last Honours to him may be some small Alleviation of our Sorrow  The  Thebans  granted their Request and they buried him with great Pomp and Splendor His Death as to the Manner of it was rather to be pitied than commended For he certainly expos'd himself more than he ought to have done But besides the natural Heat of his Temper which was not easily to be restrain'd he was animated with a more than ordinary Zeal in the Cause of Liberty especially at this Juncture when i  was in a manner deserted by the other Great States For the  Spartans  instead of exerting themselves as formerly in behalf of those who were injured were making a servile Court to  Dionysius  the Tyrant of  Sicily  and supplying him with Officers The  A  enian  were at the same time kept in Pay by this very  Alexander  and in Honour to him had erected his Statue This therefore  Pelopidas  thought the fairest Occasion of advancing his own and his Country's Honour and of making it appear to the rest of  Greece  that the  Thebans  were the only People who waged War t  succour the distress'd and to destroy all arbi  trary and unjust Government And this wa  the principal Motive of his entering upon this Expedition But besides these Considerations he was fired with Resentment against the Person of  Alexander  by whom he had been s  injuriously treated and could not forego such an Opportunity of endeavouring as well to re  venge himself of the Tyrant as to extirpa  the Tyranny  He was of one of the best Families in  Thebes  and came early to the Possession of a large Fortune  His Character  which he employ'd chiefly in the Relief o  such as wanted and deserved his Assistance Among the rest he pitch'd upon  Epaminondas  as proper Object of his Bounty but could neve  prevail with him to accept a Present from him Which had such an Effect upon him that h  chose to conform himself after his Example t  a plain frugal and laborious way of living an  there was in his Apparel and at his Table a  open unaffected Simplicity which he ever after wards maintain'd in the highest Posts of th  Government But notwithstanding this Regularity  and Appearance of Oeconomy his constant Attention to the Business of the Publick made him neglect his private Affairs and very much impair'd his Estate insomuch that having a great Number of Children to provide for his Friends took Occasion one Day to tell him  That Mony was a very necessary thing It is so indeed  said he  but it is for that Man yonder  pointing to one  Nicodemus  who was lame and blind There was a great Conformity of Manners between him and  Epaminondas  except that he delighted most in the Exercises of the Body and the other in those of the Mind But they had the same general Disposition to Virtue and the Love of their Country and this begat the strictest Friendship between them  Plutarch  dates the Beginning of it from the Siege of  Mantinea  soon after the  Peace of Antalcidas  The  Thebans  acting then in Alliance with  Sparta Epaminondas  and  Pelopidas  were engag'd together and their Wing giving way they kept their Ground and stood singly in each others Defence till  Pelopidas  being very much wounded fell among the Slain  Epaminondas  concluded him dead yet would not leave his Body in the Power of the Enemy but tho' he was wounded himself likewise maintain'd the Conflict till at length  Agesipolis  the  Spartan  King came up from the other Wing of the Army and rescu'd them both when to all Appearance they were lost This was an Action that must in all Probability have happen'd  before the Town was besieg'd and there is room to collect from  Pausanias  that it did so But it is not generally taken notice of nor any where particularly describ'd neither does it elsewhere appear that either of these two Generals had distinguish'd themselves so early in any Engagement However this Circumstance of their Lives in the manner it is attested may have its Weight and it is too remarkable a one to be omitted But however their Friendship began it was very sincere and lasting and the Success of their Atchievements was almost intirely owing to that perfect Union and good Correspondence that was always between them without any Jealousy of Command abroad or Rivalship in the Administration at home This good Agreement between them has been taken notice of in opposition to that Spirit of Dissension Envy and Rancour which formerly reign'd in  Athens  between  Aristides  and  Themistocles Cimon  and  Pericles Nicias  and  Alcibiades  who great as they were in other respects were always endeavouring to supplant and ruin one another and their personal Enmity was said to exceed that which they bore to the Enemies of their Country But yet it has been shewn that some of them knew how to sti  le their Jealousies upon Occasion and to curb and moderate their Resentment when the Affairs of the Publick requir'd it But there was no need of any Management of this kind between  the two Great Men we are now speaking of They had no private Views of their own they were above all Considerations of Mony and they had no Ambitions but for the Publick so that provided That were well served their Intention was answer'd and each of them look'd upon the others Success in it as his own As to what relates further to  Pelopidas  singly he was very strong and active and of indesatigable Industry he was bold and enterprising and so successful withal that he never lost one Battle He had so throughly established himself in the Favour and Affections of the People that he was chose thirteen times Governor of  Boeotia  or as  Diodorus  says without Interuption from the Time of the recovering the  Cadm√™a  Upon the whole he was at least the second Man of  Thebes  and in some respects may be consider'd as the First particularly with regard to the Affair of the  Cadm√™a  which was certainly the Foundation of the  Theban  Greatness He would indeed have persuaded  Epaminondas  to bear a part with him in that Undertaking but he declin'd it as an Action of too much Blood and Outrage He told him  That if the rest who were concern'd in it were as moderate as their Chief he should make no Scruple of joining with them but that some of them he foresaw would carry their Passion and Revenge too far and must necessarily involve the Innocent with the Guilty  However in the main he approv'd the Design as the Cause of Liberty and in some measure contributed towards the Success tho' he did not care to be engaged in the desperate Part of it  The  Thebans  as well to revenge the Death of  Pelopidas  as to improve the Victory of the  Thessalians  which they were not able to do of themselves forthwith sent to their Assistance seven thousand Foot and seven hundred Horse who soon defeated and broke to pieces the Remainder of  Alexander  's Army  Alexander  defeated and reduced to Terms  Whereupon he was compell'd to restore the Towns he ha  taken from the  Thessalians  and to withdraw his Garrisons out of all the other Places h  had unjustly seized and he was further obli  ged by Oath to take part with the  Theban  in their Wars whenever they should requir  it Upon these Conditions they permitted him to return in peace to his own Domini  ons where he continued about seven Year longer till he was grown so insupportable t  every Body about him that he was murther'd it  his Bed by his Wife and his Brothers  Is murther'd  H  dead Body was dragg'd about the Streets an  trodden under Foot and left as a Prey so the Dogs Nor were any Indignities of thi  kind though too much for him  Account of his Cruelt    who had been wont to bury some alive and to dress up other in Bears and Boars Skins to be baited an  shot at for his Diversion and who had surprise  nd massacred the Inhabitants of whole Cities which were in Friendship and Alliance with him But amidst these Cruelties there is one Instance recorded of him wherein he discover'd some little Sparks of Humanity and Remorse which yet he was far from valuing himself upon For seeing a famous Tragoedian act in the  Troades  of  Euripides  he went abruptly out of the Theatre but sent to bid the Actor go on with his Part for that he did not go out of any Dislike of his Performance but because he was asham'd that he who had never shewn any Concern for those he had murther'd should be seen to weep for the Sufferings of  Hecuba  and  Andromache  But to return to the  Thebans  they were still restlcss in their Pursuit of Power and sought all Opportunities of advancing themselves upon the Weakness or Divisions of the other States They who furnish'd them with the most plausible Pretence for stirring at this time  Olymp  Divisions among the  Arcadians  were the  Arcadians  who were quarrelling among themselves about some consecrated Mony which they had taken out of the Temple of  Olympia  during their Disputes with the  Eleans  and applied to the Payment of a select Body of their Troops call'd the  Epariti  The  Mantineans  protested against it as Sacrilege and brought over several of  The Council of Ten Thousand  who had at first consented to it to retract their Opinion and to agree with them that  it was a wicked thing which would sor ever brand them with Infamy and entail a Curs  upon their Posterity The debating this Matter was principally between the  Tegeans  and  Mantineans  and it wrought such Confusion between them and the rest of the  Arca  ians  that they thought it necessary for the Peace of the Community to make it up as well a  they could both with the  Eleans  and among themselves But the leading Men who had touch'd the Mony apprehending they might be call'd to an Account for it thought the best way of preventing such an Enquity would be to embroil Matters still more and theresore sent to the  Thebans  to let them know the  Arcadians  were upon the point of revolting to the  Spartans  if they did not speedily come in and put a Stop to it At the same time they sent Directions to a  Theban  Officer in  Tegea  to seize some of their own People as Disturbers of the Peace And accordingly great Numbers were apprehended and consin'd as Prisoners of the State But this occasion'd such a general Clamour that they were soon after discharg'd  and Complaint was made of it at  Thebes  as a Matter of Impeachment against the Officer for intermeddling in their Affairs and attempting to interrupt the good Correspondence between the Two States The more moderate among them who saw the Consequence of calling in a foreign Power to decide their Differences  protested against the  Thebans  marching their Troops into their Territories and did what they could to prevent it  Which the Thebans take advantage of  But the  The  ans  could not be prevail'd upon to let slip such an Opportunity of getting once more a footing in  Peloponnesus  which was their real Design and  Epaminondas  made no great Secret of it but he told them at the same time by way of Justification  That the  Thebans  had been drawn into the War on their Account that therefore they had acted treacherously with them in making Peace with  Athens  without their Consent however that when he should march his Army into  Peloponnesus  to assist his Friends there he should see what Proofs they the  Arcadians  would then give of their Fidelity  This was deliver'd in so magisterial and menacing a Stile that they who were best afsected to the  Thebans  did not like it and the  Mantineans  with such others as were concerned for the good of the Community and the general Safcty of  Peloponnesus  concluded there was no time to be lost in providing against the worst that could happen  Accordingly they sent to the  Athenians  and  Spartans  to apprise them of the Danger  Athens and Sparta  to assist the Mantine    and to ask their Assistance They immediately took the Alarm and enter'd into a strict Consederacy sor their common Defence And to prevent all Disputes about the Command in the Army it was agreed to divide it in such mannet  that each State was to have it within their own Territories This was a point the  Arcadians  had very much at heart But the  Spartans  being now so easily persuaded to give that up to them which they had so long contcsted with the  Athenians  even till they were reduced to the greatest Extremity was a plain Proof how much they were terrified with the Apprechensions of another Descent into  Peloponnesus  Epaminondas  in the mean time began his March with all the  Boeotians  some  Euboean    and a Body of  Thessalian  Horse expecting to be join'd by the  Argives Messenions  and many others upon his appearing among them Upon his first Arrival in  Peloponnesus  he lay for some time at  Nemea  a Town in the Te  itory of  Argos  where he might reasonably hope to intercept the  Athenians  in their March to join their Consederates but receiving Intelligence that they were to pass by Sea he removed to  which City with the greatest Part of  Areadia  immediately declared for him The  Spartans  with their Consederates had their general Rendezvous at  Mant    which they naturally imagin'd would be first attack'd as being the chief Seat of those who had revolted from the  Thebans  But whilst they were securing themselves on this Side  Epaininondas  considering that the City of  Spar  a  was in a manner drain'd for  this Expedition broke up privately  Epaminondas endeavours to surprise Sparta  and march'd all Night in order to surprise it But the Design being discover'd to  Agesilaus  as he was upon his March to  Mantinea  he sent immediate Notice of it to  Sparta  with Orders to put the Town in a Posture of Defence 'till he could come in to its Relief which he did with such Expedition that  Epaminondas  found him in the City ready to receive him That which is here related of  Agesilaus  is by  Diodo  us Siculus  ascribed to  Agis  the other  Spartan  King However that be it is certain that  Agesilaus  had a principal Part in the Defence of the City The few Forces in it were posted to the best Advantage that the Time and other Circumstances would admit of and the old Men and Boys were placed on the Tops of the Houses to annoy the Enemy with Darts and Stones  Epaminondas  tho' he found by this Disposition that his Design was discover'd yet made an Assault at several Parts of the City but met with the most vigorous Opposition  Ages  ans  saw there was now no room for that Caution or Cunning  But is  Agehlau    which had served him upon other Occasions Wherefore putting all upon a desperate Push he exerted himself far beyond what could be expected from his Years and by dint of Valour repuls'd the Enemy But great Part of the Glory of this Action was due to his Son  Archidamus  The  who having les  hundred Men with him was at all the  dangerous Passes where the Enemy press'd hardest He pass'd the River in open Defiance of the  Thebans  then march'd up an Eminence charg'd and routed those Soldiers who a  Xenophon  expresses it  breath'd Fire  and who so lately beat the  Spartans  when they had the Advantage both of the Ground and the Numbers He who signaliz'd himself most as a private Man  and of  Isadas  was  Isadas  the Son of  Phabidas  He was a very beautiful large and wellproportion'd Youth scarce arrived at the Age of  Manhood He had just anointed himself at Home when the Alarm being given he rush'd out without any Arms and almost naked then snatching a Spear in one Hand and a Sword in the other he broke into the thickest of his Enemies and bore down all before him The  Ephori  after the Action was over gave him a Garland as the Reward of his Gallantry but then to keep up the Rigour of their Discipline fined him a thousand  Drachmas  for going into the Battle unarmed  The  Spartan  Forces were now come up from  Mantinca  and were follow'd by most of the Confederates  so that  Epaminondas  finding nothing more to be done on that Side drew of his Army and turn'd towards  Mantinea  which he judged to be now quite desenceless For besides that the Troops were drawn out of it the Inhabitants were scatter'd about in the Fi  having taken that Opportunity whilst the War  was removed into another Quarter to get in their Harvest Wheresore he resolved to attack the Town and first order'd the Horse thither who found the People dispers'd in the manner they had been informed and all things to Appearance as they expected But it happen'd that six thousand  Athenian  Auxiliaries who coming by Sea knew nothing of what had pass'd at  Sparta  and having pass'd the  Isthmus  in order to join the Confederates as they supposed in  Mantinea  were just got into the Town and without staying to refresh themselves or their Horses march'd out and gave the  Thebans  Battle After an obstinate Dispute with some Loss on both Sides the  Athenians  got the better  Mantinea  reliev'd by the  Atheniens  and took those who were without the Walls under their Protection This Action was a very sharp one but not decisive and is to be consider'd rather as a Skirmish and a Prelude to what happen'd afterwards than as a Victory However it was of more immediate Consequence to the  Mantineans  who without such a seasonable and miraculous Relies must have been lost And  Hegelochus  who commanded this Body of  Athenians  obtain'd great Honour by making such a Stand against the  Thebans  who were much superior in Numbers and were also supported by the  Thessalian  Horse  Epaminondas  was very much piqu'd at the ill Success of these two last Enterprises which he  was asraid would lessen him in the Opinion of his Allies and sully the Glory of his former A  chievements and therefore thought himself obliged to attempt something further to support his own and his Country's Honour and to keep up the Spirits of those whom he had taken under his Protection And as the Time allotted him for this Expedition was very near expiring he had no time to lose Besides he was got so far into the Enemies Country and they were so well prepared sor him and watch'd his Motions so narrowly that he thought he could not easily secure his Retreat without fighting or that if he did it would be abandoning and sacrificing his Allies These Considerations determin'd him to proceed immediately to Action and by one decisive Battle either to make himself Master of  Peloponnesus  or to fall honourably in the Attempt  Accordingly  A M  upon the  Spartans  coming to the Relies of the  Mantincans  he prepar'd to attack them and this drew on a general Engagement of both the Armies with their respective Consederates That of the  Thebans  consisted of thirty thousand Foot and three thousand Horse which was more by a third Part both of Horse and Foot than the  Spartans  had with the  Athenians  and all the rest of their Associates The  Mantineans  as the War was in their Territori  were in the right Wing with the  Spartans  next to them the  Athenians  in the lest and the  Achaans  Eleans  and others of less Note made up the main Body The  Thebans  with the  Arcadians  chose the Left of their Army to oppose the Right of the Enemy the  Argives  were in the right and their main Body consisted of the  Euboeans Locrians Sicyonians Messenians Thessalians  and others And both the Armies were flank'd with their Horse  But after this Disposition  Epaminondas  took a Compass as if he declin'd fighting and then made his Troops halt and lay down their Arms with a shew of encamping at a small Distance from the Enemy hoping by this Feint to allay their Heat and take off the first Impression of their Fury and then to fall upon them by Surprise wich happen'd in a great measure as he expected For when he afterwards advanc'd towards them they had quitted their Arms and their Horses and were so dispers'd about that they had much ado to form themselves in time However they recover'd the Surprise and stood the Charge with great Resolution  Epaminondas  put the Issue of the Battle upon his left Wing as he did at  Leuctra  and his Scheme of breaking in upon the Enemy was much after the same manner by placing the best of his Men in Front then drawing them up close and narrowing them to a Point so as to penetrate like the Beak of a Gally as  Xenophon  expresses it The Engagement began with the Horse and it was very hot and obstinate till at length the  Athenians  who  bore the Brunt of it were so gall'd with the Darts and Slings of the  Thessalians  and so overpower'd with the Numbers of the  Thebans  that they were forc'd to give Way and to leave their Foot expos'd but yet they kept themselves in a Body so as not to break in upon them And in their Retreat meeting with a Detachment of the  Euboeans  and other Mercenaries whom  Epaminondes  had sent round to attack their Rear they fell in among them and cut them entirely to pieces The rest of the  Athenians  in that Wing were hard press'd by the  Argives  and the  Theben  Horse but some  Elean  Horse who had been posted in the Rear as a Body of Reserve coming up to their Relief they maintain'd their Ground Their Horse in the other Wing made the same vigorous Resistance but were forc'd at last to throw themselves in among their Foot for Protection  Upon this the Foot join'd Battle and sought with incredible Fury especially the  Spartans  and the  Thebans  who were more immediately concern'd in the Event of the Action and were never more in Earnest Their Lances being broke with the Violence of the Charge they clos'd in with their Swords and stood Foot to Foot neither Side abating of their Rage or giving back one Inch of Ground Which  Epaminondas  perceiving form'd a Troop of the most determin'd Men about him and putting himself at the Head of them made a very vigorous  Charge upon the  Lacedaemonian  Phalanx and wounded their General with the first Javelin he threw And his Troop pushing on with the same Ardour he soon broke the Enemy to pieces and then made such Havock among them that the Ground about him was cover'd with the Bodies of the Slain But advancing still forwards in order to make a thorough Rout of it the  Spartans  rallied and collected themselves into a Body pointing their whole Fury at him and throwing an infinite Number of Darts at him  Epaminondas kill'd  many of which he drew out of his Body and retorted at them till at last he was mortally wounded by a Javelin which was said to be thrown by  Gryllus  the Son of  Xenophon  who was afterwards kill'd himself in the same Battle But the Death of  Epaminondas  is by some ascrib'd to  Anticrates  a  Spartan  who as a Reward for so  minent a Piece of Service was exempted from all publick Offices and Taxes and  Plutarch  says there was one of his Descendants remaining in  his Time who enjoy'd the same Immunities The  Thebans  upon their General's falling renew'd the Attack in order to rescue his Body and after a very sharp Resistance on the Part of the  Spartans  carried it off This Missortune put an End to the Action and both Sides parted as it were by Consent  Xenophon  makes it entirely a drawn Battle and says that each Party  rected Trophies and ask'd leave to bury their Dead that neither of them took any Town  nor gain'd any Accession of Territory or any Encrease of Power and that Things remain'd just in the same Situation after the Battle as they were before But however exact and faithful he may be in the other Parts of his History he is thought upon this Occasion to have been a little prejudic'd and to have industriously avoided saying too much to the Advantage of the  Thebans  who had manifestly the Victory though they were in too much Concern and Confusion to pursue it and the only Grounds upon which the Enemy disputed it with them was on account of the  Euboeans  and others whom the  Athenians  in their Retreat had cut to pieces  Epaminondas  was carried alive into his Tent where assoon as he recover'd his Speech he ask'd his Friends about him  Whether the Enemy had taken his Shield from him  They told him  It was safe  and it being brought to him he kiss'd it He then ask'd  Which Side had the Victory  They told him  The  Thebans  All then  said he  is well  And soon after upon the drawing the Head of the Javelin out of his Body he sell as it were in the Arms of Victory and congramlating the good Fortune of his Country expired  There was something very great and solemn in these Circumstances of his Death  His Character  and suitable to that just and deliberate Firmness and Composure of Mind which he had shewn in all the Actions of his Life To consider him in all Respects as  a Soldier Statesman and Philosopher he was not only as  Cicero  esteems him the first Man of  Greece  but the greatest perhaps that any Age or Country has produc'd For all the several Virtues which others posses'd singly were united in him and in so perfect a Degree as to be without an Allay of any one Vice or Failing Besides his natural good Disposition he had all the Advantages of Education and was furnish'd with the best Masters not only for Eloquence and Philosophy but also for his Exercises and all the other lighter Accomplishments Hence it was that  Polymnis  his Father's House was at that time one of the best Schools in  Greece  and open to all the learned World He was indeed more liberal upon this Head of Expence than his Circumstancees would allow for tho' he was of one of the best Families in  Thebes  he died so poor as to leave his Son no other Fortune than what he had bestow'd on him in this manner It happen'd however that he neither wanted nor desired one For he had such a thorough Contempt of Riches that he did not leave enough to bury him He was in this as in many other Respects a Philosoper in Practice and Reality and was poor upon Choice and yet without any Affectation he View of being applauded for it  Jusian  says he was no more desirous of Fame than he was of Riches He did not indeed affc  Popularity or Applause he was so modest that all his great Offices were in a manner forc'd  upon him and his first Motive in all his Undertakings was the Honour of his Country But yet he had not an Insensibility of Glory with regard to himself as may appear from the Answer he made to his Friends about him when he was dying Among other Expressions of their Grief for the Loss of him they lamented his leaving no Children behind him  Yes  said he  I leave two fair Daughters the Victories of  Leuctra  and  Mantinea  to perpetuate my Memory  Upon another Occasion being ask'd  Whether he thought himseif or  Chabrias  or  Iphicrates  the better General 'Tis hard  said he  to judge while we live  There are other Instances to prove that he knew what was due to his Merit and that he did not decline Praise tho' he did not covet it He was covetous of nothing but his Time which he employ'd wholly in the Improvement of his Mind or in what he thought might be useful to the Publick and he made even his Diversions subservient to that End His Running Wrestling and other Exercises of that Kind were not used by him as they generally were by others barely for Amusement or the Glory of excelling in them but as Lessons of Instruction in the Art of War For which Reason he had an Aversion to sat Men in the Army and disbanded one  who  he said  would require three or four Shields to cover his Belly  He had an extraordinary Genius for War and had thoroughly studied the Theory of it before he enter'd upon Action It has appear'd  from his Disposition and his Manner of attacking both at  Leuctra  and  Mantinea  that he was particularly well skill'd in the  Tacticks  That which has set him in a Light above most of the  Grecian  Generals is the Difficulties and Discouragements which he met with upon his first Appearance in the World He had to do with a People who were sunk into a State of Sloth and Idleness and disposed to Slavery They were very low at that time in their Reputation for Arms And tho' they had taken some Part in the late Wars it was occasionally only and rather in order to support themselves by their Attachment to those who were best able to protect them than with a Sense of gaining Honour or asserting their Freedom They had but few Troops and those were without Spirit or Discipline and without Officers to conduct them This was not the Case of the great Captains who went before him especially those of  Athens  and  Sparta  who had Troops ready form'd and disciplin'd inur'd to Dangers and Fatigue sir'd with Ambition and the Love of their Country supported by their FellowCitizens and flush'd with Victory So that their Commanders had nothing more to do than to pursue the Track of Glory they were in and to carry on the Service in the Way they found it  Epaminondas  had none of these Advantages But by his Courage and Zeal and the Force of his Genius he supply'd the want of them and in effect created  an Army which being train'd up by his Instructions and animated by his Example soon shew'd the  Thebans  that they were capable of acting for themselves and fighting their own Battles From hence it was that from Auxillaries and Dependents they became Principals and put in for their Turn of Superiority in  Grecce  It must be allow'd that  Pelopidas  had pav'd the Way for him in effecting this Change and that he had been assisting to him in most of his great Enterprizes But without  Epimanondas  the Work had been left very imperfect It was his bold Defiance of the  Spartans  that brought on the Battle of  Leuctra  And he afterwards went further towards the reducing them than any one Man or than all the States of  Greece  together And tho' he did not throughly succeed in it he had so disabled and dispirited them that they never recover'd their former Reputation and Authority Among other Marks of their being humbled he had brought them to  lengthen their Monosyllables  as he himself express'd it in rallying them upon that assected and  I don't  I may be allow'd  But it seeme to be justified by the  which Taci  despotick Brevity with which they were wont to expres  mselves in their Answers to those who o  er'd to treat or expostulate with them His Military Virtues were still inferior to those which regarded either the Society or himself His Dis  edness was visible in every Circumstance of his  Life And nothing could ever shake his Integrity or slacken his Zeal sor the Publick The  Persians  knowing of what Consequence it was to fix him in their Interest sent  Diomedon  of  Cyzicus  to tempt him with a large Sum of Mony He first gain'd  Micythus  a particular Favourite of his and gave him five Talents to sound him upon it But  Epaminondas  rejected the Offer with Disdain and Indignation declaring That he would not put the Riches of the Universe in Competition with the Good of his Country You  Diomedon said he  don't know me and I am not surprized that you should form a Judgment of me from yourself for which Reason I forgive you but withal advise you to make the best of your Way home that you may not have an Opportunity of corrupting others As for you  said he addressing himself to  Micythus if you don't immediately restore him his Mony I'll deliver you up to the Magistracy His Generosity and Friendship have sufficiently appear'd in his Behaviour to  Pelopidas  He was judicious and grave but yet afsable he was continent patient of Injuries and very compassionate and to crown all he was strictly just and so sincere a Lover of Truth that he would not tell a Lye even in Jest He was also a very able Speaker and had gone further in his Search after Knowledge of all Kinds than most of the Pailosophers of his Time who were so by Profession And yet he did not value himself upon it or make any Shew of it and it was said of  him in this Respect  That Nobody knew more than he and spoke less  Study was indeed his darling Passion and he was so devoted to it that he may be consider'd almost as a single Instance of one who acquitted himself so well to the Publick against the natural Bent of his Inclination It was look'd upon as Matter of Astonishment that a Man who was so much hid from the World and buried as it were in Books should break out at once into so great and so tumultuous a Scene of Action that he should negotiate the Interests of his Country abroad manage the Government at home and lead an Army with such Success against the united Powers of  Greece  But he had a Capacity for every thing and applied himself to every thing and when he was once roused by a Sense of what the Publick expected from him he gave up his belov'd Retirement and was from thenceforwards in such continual Motion that Nobody every did so much in so short a Time When the  Thebans  were once brought into Action he resolv'd to keep them up to it If I am your General  said he  you must be Soldiers  Boeotia  as being an open flat Country  he told them  was the Stage of War and that they could keep it no longer than they had their Hands  upon their Shields  It was by these Maxims and this Conduct that he became the Support of his Country and a Pattern to the greatest Captains of the present and succeeding Times  Philopaemen  who is call'd the last of the  Grecians  made  it his Study to imitate him and is said to have come very little short of him in his Valour and Conduct and his Integrity But he was more rough and cholerick and had too much of the Soldier in his common Deportment whereas  Epaminondas  was cool and gentle and had nothing of Fierceness but in the Field Upon the whole he rais'd the Glory of  Thebes  to an Heighth beyond any of her Neighbours at that Time and that so suddenly that it was said to be born with him And it will appear by the Sequel of the Story how far it may be likewise said to have expir'd with him  THE GRECIAN HISTORY BOOK II  The Affairs of Greece from the Battle of Mantinea to the Death of Philip of Macedon Containing the Space of YEARS  CHAP I  From the Battle of Mantinea to the End of the Social War Containing the Space of YEARS  _THE Battle of  Mantinea  was the greatest that ever was fought by  Grecians  against  Gr  cians  the whole Strength of the Country being drawn out and ranged according to their different Interests And it was fought with an  Obstinacy equal to the Importance of it which was the fixing the Empire of  Greece  And this must of course have have been transferr'd to the  Thebans  upon their Victory if they had not lost the Fruits of it by the Death of their General who was the Soul of all their Counsels and Designs This blasted all their Hopes and put out their sudden Blaze of Power almost as soon as it was kindled However They did not presently give up their Pretensions They were still rank'd among the Leading States and made several further Struggles but they were faint and ineffectual and such as were rather for Life and Being than for Superiority and Dominion They proposed nothing further to themselves at present than an honourable Peace and this was according to the Opinion of  Epaminondas  himself who when he lay wounded in his Tent inquir'd after those whom he judged most proper to succeed him in the Command and finding they were kill'd in the Battle advised them to make Peace which they easily concluded for their Enemies were as weary of the War as themselves The Conditions were  The Peace renew'd by all but the  Spartans  That every one should retain what they were now in possession of and hold it independent of any other Power  Hereupon all the States of  Greece  enter'd into a League Offensive and Defensive excepting only the  Spartans  who refus'd to ratify the Treaty because the  Messenians  were included  in it This Opposition was rais'd chiefly by  Agesilaus  Agesilaus  censur'd for it  who was therefore look'd upon as stubborn and refractory and an unreasonable Protracter of the War especially as he had no Mony to carry it on but what he was to raise by Loans and heavy Taxes And his Stickling with so much Obstinacy at this Time for the Country of  Messenia  revived in the Minds of the People the great Extent of Territory and the great Dominion both by Sea and Land that he had lost since his Accession to the Throne  But whatever Censure he had incurr'd by this Proceeding  Olymp  His Transactions in  Aegypt  his next Enterprise which was the last Scene of his Life was still more blameable at least with regard to himself tho' it did not so much affect the Interest of his Country  Tachos  who had usurped the Kingdom of  Aegypt  being at War with the  Persians  engaged  Agesilaus  to assist him with a Body of  Spartans  Accordingly he enter'd into that Service expecting to have the sole Command of the Army Upon his Arrival in  Aegypt  all the great Officers of the Crown went to pay their Compliments to him and the whole Country flock'd down to the Shore to see the Man whose Reputation in Arms had made so much Noise in the World But they were much disappointed when instead of the great and awful Prince they look'd for they found a little old Man of a contemptible  Presence lying on the Grass his Cloaths threadbare and his Hair uncomb'd and rejecting their rich Presents of Sweetmeats and Perfumes which he told them they might give to his Slaves the  Helots  He join'd the  Aegyptian  Army which consisted of eighty thousand Men besides ten thousand hired Troops whereof one thousand were  Spartans  But  Tachos  deceiv'd him in his Expectations of being General and would allow him no other Command than that of the  Mercenaries  at Land committing to  Chabrias  who came in as a Voluntier from  Athens  the Charge of his Fleet and reserving to himself the chief Command over all  Agesilaus  was otherwise treated by him with so much Insolence and in a manner so much below his Spirit and Dignity that he took an Opportunity to fall in with  Nectanebus  his Son or rather his Nephew who had revolted from him and got himself to be proclaim'd King in his stead And the People being generally on his Side  Agesilaus  join'd with them and drove  Tathos  out of his Kingdom He had no sooner withdrawn himself but another Competitor started up and march'd against  Nectanebus  with an Army of an hundred thousand Men who shut him up in one of his Towns and laid Siege to it When the Works were pretty well advanc'd and the Lines of Circumvallation drawn almost round the Place  Nectanebus  threw himself among the  Grecians  and sallying  out by Night at the Gap where the Lines were unfinished drew up his Forces and easily routed those of the Enemy who were entangled and encompassed by their own Works This was owing intirely to the Advice and Conduct of  Agesilaus  who improved this Victory by several others 'till he had settled  Nectanebus  in full and quiet Possession of the Throne  Diodorus  relates this Part differently as if  Agesilaus  had reconcil'd himself to  Tachos  and reinstated him in the Kingdom But this rests singly upon his Authority and the other Account is more natural as well as more general  Agesilaus  acquitted himself extremely well as to the military Part of this Expedition but it does not in other Respects redound much to his Honour One chief Motive of his undertaking it was Gain which he cover'd under a pretence of supplying the Necessities of the State But the letting himself out to hire to a Barbarian and serving under an  Aegyptian  Rebel as a Captain only of a Band of  Mercenaries  was thought very unbecoming a  Spartan  King especially of his Age and Character He first made a mean Figure by entering into that Service and then a scandalous one by deserting it and joining with the Enemy of him whom he came to as an Auxiliary He endeavour'd to justify himself by several false Pretences and according to the common Plea of the  Spartans  in the like Cases call'd it Acting  for the Benefit of his Country But whatever Name he gave it it was certainly a foul Action and  Plutarch  calls it downright Treachery And it was more so in him because it was purely his own Act without being tied down by any express Orders from the Government of  Sparta  The Winter following  Nectanebus  dismiss'd him with great Marks of Civility and Gratitude for the Services he had done him and gave him two hundred and thirty Talents of Silver with which he sail'd homeward but was drove by Stress of Weather upon a desart Shore of  Africa  call'd  The Haven of Menelaus  where he sicken'd and died  His Death  being full eighty four Years old of which he had reigned forty one  He was so extraordinary a Man  and Character  and had so many mixt Qualities that besides what has been already observ'd of him in the course of the History it may be proper to take a more distinct View of him He set out in the World with strong Prejudices against him both as to his Person and his Pretensions The first of them he overcame by the Sprightliness of his Air and his Goodhumour with a way he had of jesting upon himself which prevented others using the same Freedom with him However he was so sensible of his Defects that he would not suffer any Picture or Statue to be made of him in his Lifetime and utterly for  id the doing it after his Death His Way  to the Throne was attended with greater Difficulties which yet he got over by his Spirit and Address and by the Assistance of his Friends particularly of  Lysander  who in effect put the Crown upon his Head And in that respect it was made a Charge of Ingratitude upon  Agesilaus  that he had afterwards upon a slight Pretence thrown him off But he himself was the Cause of it he valued himself too much upon his Services to him and his Behaviour to him in  Asia  has been shewn to be so arrogant and assuming that it might very well justify his sending him away from him when he found he could no longer act with him  Lysander  full of Resentment upon his Return form'd a powerful Party against him to break which he singled out the Ringleaders some of whom he sent away upon foreign Services others he got to be accused of Avarice and Injustice in their Employments and then made it his Business to bring them off thereby obliging them to become his Friends and so by degrees he wore out the Faction As he was a younger Son he was bred up with more Severity and Subjection than the immediate Heirs of the Crown and by the Obedience he paid to the Laws as a private Man he was better fitted for the Government when he came to it He made great court to the  Ephori  and the Senate even to a Shew of Reverence and by the Deference he paid to  their Power he secretly advanc'd his own and by that Means carried the Prerogative higher than any of his Predecessors But his Popularity grew at last suspected insomuch that he is said to have been fined by the  Ephori  for  monopolizing  the Citizens who were look'd upon as the common Goods of the Republick He was remarkable for his Continency and Moderation and kept up the old  Spartan  Plainness and Frugality even to Affectation not allowing his Wife and Daghter to distinguish themselves by their Dress and living in the same House that belong'd to  Aristodemus  his Predecessor above seven hundred Years before nor suffering so much as the Door of it to be repair'd Yet notwithstanding this rigid Appearance there was nothing of Stiffness or Moroseness in his Behaviour he treated every Body with Candour and Affability and had such a Complacency and Agreeableness in his Conversation as made him amiable to the last He was very sond of his Children and would often enter into their little Sports with them Being one Day surpriz'd by a Friend as he was riding with them on an Hobbyhorse  Say nothing of it  said he  till you are a Father yourself  He was generous to his Enemies not detracting any thing from their due Merit easily forgiving and never taking any unjust Advantage against them On the other hand he was too partial to his Friends whom in all Cases right or wrong he thought himself oblig'd to  support Of which there is an Instance in a Letter of his to  Idrieus  Prince of  Caria  wherein he says  If  Nicias  be innocent acquit him if he be guilty acquit him upon my account however be sure to acquit him  Of the same Kind was his interposing in Behalf of  Phaebidas  and  Sphodrias  and yet the Consequence of it was in a great measure the engaging  Sparta  in the  Leuctrian  War It was a Saying of his  That to be straitlaced in Point of Justice when one's Friend is concerned is only a Pretence for deserting him  Yet Nobody talk'd more of Justice upon other Occasions than he did insomuch that some about him expatiating one Day upon the Grandeur of the King of  Persia Wherein  said  Agesilaus does his Grandeur consist Or how is he greater than I am if he be not more just  By which he would have it understood that Justice was the Rule of all his Actions But he has not given many Instances of it especially in his publick Character wherein he was so different from what he was in his private Life that he may be consider'd as two different Persons His Failings in the latter were few and generally speaking goodnatur'd ones but in his Regal and Military Capacity his Passions were much stronger and his Faults more unpardonable The same aspiring Temper which he discover'd from his Childhood and by which he afterwards usurp'd the Crown carried him on to the last Stage of his Life and bore down all other Considerations  that stood in the Way of his Ambition And yet he manag'd so well that he pass'd the first thirty Years of his Reign in great Honour and Esteem But as he advanc'd further in Years he grew more perverse and arbitrary and withal more restless and impatient continually forming new Schemes of Action and never easy but in War and indeed he had admirable Talents for  t He was brave active and vigilant he had  nur'd himself to the Extremes of Heat and Cold and far'd as hard in other Respects as a private Centinel He was very careful to keep up the Courage of his Soldiers for which Purpose he would conceal or lessen the News of a Defeat in other Parts or sometimes substitute the Report of a Victory in the room of it He had a more  efin'd way of deceiving his Enemies by publishing his real Design of a March or an Attack so that they might take it for a Feint and consequently be unprepar'd for him Nobody knew better how to use the Advantages of Time and Place or to effect by Stratagem what he could not obtain by Force And notwithstanding his natural Impetuosity he could command himself upon Occasion and was either cool and tempe  rate or daring and desperate according as the Case requir'd of which he gave sufficient Proofs in his Defence of the City of  Sparta  His Behaviour upon that Occasion when the Whole was at Stake was great and glorious tho' it must be allow'd at the same time that he did  nothing more than what he ow'd to his Country whose Interests he had sacrificed to his implacable Hatred of the  Thebans  and  Messenians  and his insatiable Thirst of Revenge The  Spartans  were so sensible of his Abilities that when he was in  Asia  they constituted him Admiral as well as General which was an Honour they had never before conferr'd on one single Person His Power after that Expedition encreasing in Proportion to the Opinion they had of him he did what he would with them and brought them into such a Condition that they were forc'd to rely upon him and to stand or fall with him And tho' he sav'd them from immediate Destruction he had sufficiently drain'd and harass'd them and left them in a miserable declining State  Lysander  gave the first Shock to their Power by his Pride and  Agesilaus  quite broke it by his Obstinacy the first made them odious to their Neighbours and the latter made them contemptible And upon the Whole it may be said that  Sparta  ow'd her Downfal to the two greatest Men she ever bred  The Death of  Epaminondas  and the Peace which ensu'd upon it had slacken'd the Zeal of the principal Powers of  Greece  The indolent State of  Greece  and render'd 'em too secure The  Athenians  more particularly when they found themselves deliver'd from him who kept up their Emulation grew indolent and remiss and abandon'd themselves to their Ease and Pleasure being wholly taken up with  Shews Sports and Festivals They were naturally too much addicted to these Sorts of Amusement and they had formerly been encourag'd in them by  Pericles  who knew how to lead them by their Inclinations and took this Method to ingratiate himself with them and to divert them from inspecting too narrowly into his Administration But they now carried these Diversions to a much higher Pitch of Extravagance They had such a Passion for the Stage that it stifled in them all other Thoughts either of Business or of Glory Poets and Players were become their only Favourites and receiv'd the Esteem and Applause that was due to the Captains who had fought their Battles The very victualling of their Fleets and Armies was consum'd upon the Stage Their Singers and Dancers were pamper'd up with Marrow and other luscious Food whilst the Admiral and the Captains of the Ships had no other Provisions on board but Meal Cheese and Onions In short the Decorations and other Charges attending the Theatre were so excessive that  Plutarch  says  It cost more to represent some of the famous Pieces of  Sophocles  and  Euripides  than it had done to carry on the War against the Barbarians  And in order to support this Charge they seiz'd upon the Fund which had been set apart for the War with a Prohibition upon Pain of Death even to advise the applying it to any other Purpose They not only revers'd this Decree but went as far  the other way making it death to propose th  restoring the Fund to the Uses to which had before been appropriated under the sam  Penalties By diverting the Course of the Supplies in so extraordinary a manner and enter taining the idle Citizen at the Expence of th  Soldier and Mariner they seem'd to have n  Remains of that Spirit and Vigour which they had exerted in the  Persian  Wars when they demolish'd their Houses to furnish out a Navy an  when the Women stoned a Man to death who propos'd to appease the  Great King  as he was call'd by paying Tribute and doing Homag  to him  But whilst they were wrapt up in this slothful Security and had nothing immediately to apprehend from their old Enemies either in  Greece  or  Persia  they found themselves on a sudden engag'd with a People  Which the  Macedonians  take advantage of  who were hitherto obscure and in a manner barbarous These were the  Macedonians  who tho' they were hardy and warlike enough had never yet presum'd to intermeddle in the Affairs of  Greece  The Truth is they had enough to do at home to adjust the Quarrels about the Succession of their Kings and to defend themselves against the  Illyrians P  onians  and other powerful Neighbours But several Circumstances concur'd at this Time to raise them out of their Obscurity and to bring them into a new Scene of Action which by Degrees wrought such a thorough Change in the State of  Greece  that it will be necessary to take a cursory View of their Affairs and to consider them connectedly with those of the  Grecians  at least so far as may serve to shew by what Steps this Change was effected  They may also upon another Account seem to require a Place in the  Grecian  Story  How far they may be consider'd as Grecians  for their first Kings were of  Grecian  Extraction But they are not so much entitled to it from their Descent as from their Exploits by which the very Name of  Greece  was in a great measure lost and swallow'd up in that of  Macedonia  Before their later Atchievements which brought about this great Revolution they were no otherwise consider'd as a Part of  Greece  than many other Borderers who were originally planted from thence but having afterwards little or no Intercourse with their MotherCountry contracted the Habits and Manners of the Natives where they settled and from thence were look'd upon as one and the same People with them and in the same Degree of Barbarism This was the Case of most of the  Grecian  Colonies And therefore tho' I have had frequent occasion to mention them I have not enter'd further into their Story than as it has born relation to  Greece  either on account of their Wars or Alliances with it or of their being protected by it or becoming tributary to it or of such other Engagements and Dependences as have blended their Affairs with those of the  Gre cians  and made the Relation of them a necessary  Part of their History Thus much may suffice to account for my not having treated the most remarkable of these Colonies so fully and distinctly as might be expected from the Figure they have made in the World such as  Sicily Crete  and some others of the Islands with the  Lesser Asia  and several other Parts of the Continent But it ought to be consider'd that where their Fame and Grandeur has been owing more to their Transactions with other People than with the  Grecians  most of the Particulars concerning them do not fall within the Compass of my Design but belong more properly to a separate History of their own or to that of the Nation which they have had most to do with  The  Macedonians  were so call'd before the  Grecians  intermix'd with them  Their Original  And they were some time known by other Names which they receiv'd from the first Planters or principal Men either of the whole Country or of some particular Parts of it But the Accounts we have of these original Founders like those of the  Grecian  States are very fabulous and imperfect The first who is mention'd with any Degree of Certainty to have reign'd in  Macedonia  was  Caranus  by Birth an  Argive  and said to be the sixteenth in Descent from  Hercules  It was upon this Foundation that  Philip  grounded his Pretensions to be of the Race of  Hercules  and assum'd to himself Divine Honours wherein he carried his Vanity a great way tho' not so far as his Son did after him  Caranus  therefore is commonly reputed to have led forth a Body of his Countrymen  Their first Kings  by the Advice of the Oracle into these Parts where he settled and made himself King And yet  Herodotus  contrary to the Opinion of all the later Writers makes  Perdiccas  the first King  Sir Isaac Newton  reconciles this Difference by a very probable Conjecture that they were JointFounders of this Kingdom that they were both contemporary and of the Royal Family of  Argos  from whence they fled about the same Time and at first erected small Principalities in  Macedonia  which after the Death of  Caranus  became one under  Perdiccas  and that this Kingdom was founded about the th or th  Olympiad  From this Time the  Macedonians  were properly a  Grecian  Colony and among other Proofs of their being so it is observable that  Amyntas  which was the Name of some of their succeeding Kings was also a common Name among the  Argives  Another of their Kings was by virtue of their  Grecian  Extraction admitted to the  Olympick  Games But whatever Rights and Privileges this Nation claim'd as  Grecians  they were generally treated as  Barbarians  till such time as they carried their Arms into  Asia  and had trampled upon the Liberties of  Greece Caranus  having according to the general Account reign'd twentyeight Years the Succession was continu'd after him to the Times we are now treating of But there is very little worth Notice recorded of these Kings  they being chiefly employ'd in defending themselves against the Incursions of their Neighbours And as to their domestick Affairs they were remarkable only for the frequent Murthers and Usurpations which happen'd in the Royal Family  Amynlas  the Second  Amyntas Father of Philip  who was the Sixteenth in Descent from  Caranus  and the Father of that  Philip  whom we are now to treat of had much ado to support himself in the Throne he left it in a very tottering Condition and entail'd a  War with the  Illyrians  and  Olynthians  upon his Children By his Wife  Eurydice  he left three Sons who all in their turn succeeded to their Father  Alexander Perdiccas  and  Philip  he had also a natural Son call'd  Ptolemy Alorites  Some say he had a second Wife call'd  Gygaea  and by her had three more Sons  Archelaus Argaeus  or  Archideus  and  Menelaus  who were murder'd by  Philip  But this does not seem probable because  Eurydice  appears to have surviv'd  Amyntas  and to have been very active in the succeeding Reigns The Succession of  Alexander  and  Perdiccas  was strongly oppos'd first by  Pausanias  whose Father and himself had before usurp'd the Crown and then by their Brother  Plolemy  who is said to have murder'd  Alexander  and to have reign'd three Years upon his Death till he was afterwards slain himself by  Perdiccas Pausanias  was drove out by  Iphicrates  who at this Time happen'd to be sent by the  Athenians  with a small  Fleet into those Parts to make the necessary Dispositions for the Siege of  Amphipolis Eurydice  upon this Occasion accosted him in a very moving manner She brought her two Sons  Perdiccas  and  Philip  to him and putting one of 'em between his Arms and the other upon his Knee conjur'd him by the mutual Friendship that had pass'd between the two Nations and by the personal Kindness and Affection that her Husband had born to him that he would take these two Orphans into his Protection and defend them against the Invader But this Account of her Maternal Affection is by no means consistent with that which  Justin  gives of her That being in love with her Soninlaw who is understood to be  Ptolemy  she caus'd her own two Sons  Alexander  and  Perdiccas  to be murder'd in order to advance him to the Throne and that she had before attempted to destroy her Husband with the same View But the History of these two Kings  Alexander  and  Perdiccas  is so confus'd that not only the Transactions of one Reign seem to be ascrib'd to another but the Transactions themselves are also differently related As to  Ptolemy  the most plausible Account given of him is that upon his Competition with  Perdiccas  they referr'd themselves to  Pelopidas  who adjudging the Crown to the latter the other quitted his Pretensions And  Pelopidas  for the better Observance of this Agreement carried  Philip  with him among others as Hostage to  Thebes  There are other Occasions mention'd of his being given as an Hostage to the  Illyrians  both by his Father and his Brother  Alexander  However that be it is certain he was at  Thebes  at the Time of the Death of his Brother  Perdiccas  who according to the most general Accounts was kill'd in a Battle with the  Illyrians  This Accident brought him home  The Rise of Philip  and gave him an Opportunity of exerting those Talents by which he not only surpass'd all his Predecessors but eclips'd the Fame of all the  Grecians  of his Time tho' it must be confess'd that he receiv'd his first Impressions of Glory from 'em and that he ow'd a great deal to the Improvements he made under  Epaminondas  But besides these Advantages he had great natural Endowments and a Genius equal to the greatest Designs as may sussiciently appear from the Difficulties he had to encounter at his first setting out when he was scarce three and twenty Years old and the Means he us'd to overcome them  Perdiccas  had left a young Son to succeed him so that  Philip  had no immediate Prospect of coming to the Crown However upon the News of his Brother's Death he stole home privately from  Thebes  and taking Advantage of the Consternation the People were under and the Dangers they apprehended from an InsantReign  A M Olymp  He is dec  'd King  got himself at first declar'd Protector to his Nephew and soon after King in his stead And indeed the present Condition of the  Macedonians  requir'd  a Man of his Prudence and Activity For they were surrounded with as many Enemies as they had Neighbours The  Illyrians  flush'd with their late Victory were preparing to march against them with a strong Army the  Paeonians  were making daily Incursions upon them and at the same Time the Title to the Crown was contested by  Pausanias  and  Argaeus  the former whereof was supported by the  Thracians  and the latter by the  Athenians  who for that Purpose had sent out a good Fleet and three thousand Land Men  Under these Circumstaces with so many Enemies on his Hands at once and that before he was settled in the Throne his first Part was to make sure of his own People to gain their Affections and to raise their Spirits for they were very much dishearten'd having lost above four thousand Men in the late Action with the  Illyrians  He succeeded in these Points by the Artfulness of his Address and the Force of his Eloquence of which he was a great Master His next Step was to train and exercise them and reform their Discipline and it was at this Time that he instituted the famous  Macedonian Phalanx  He irstitutes the  Macedonian  Phalanx  which did so much Execution It was an Improvement upon the ancient Manner of fighting among the  Grecians  who generally drew up their Foot so close as to stand the Shock of the Enemy without being broken The compleat Phalanx was thought to contain above sixteen thousand  Men tho' it was also taken in general for any Company or Party of Soldiers and frequently for the whole Body of the Foot But this of  Philip's  Invention is describ'd by  Polybius  to be a long Square consisting of eight thousand Pikemen sixteen deep and five hundred in Front the Men standing so close together that the Pikes of the fifth Rank were extended three Foot beyond the Line of the Front The rest whose Distance from the Front made their Pikes useless rested them upon the Shoulders of those who stood before them and so locking them together in File press'd forwards to support and push on the former Ranks whereby the Asfault was render'd more violent and irresistible  In this Year died  Xenophon  Xenophon his Death and Character  and in the ninetieth Year of his Age Notwithstanding the Glory he had acquir'd by his  Persian  Expedition he was banish'd  Athens  for having been engag'd in it For  Cyrus  having been too great a Favourer of the  Spartans  the  Athenians  did not think he ought to receive any Countenance or Assistance from them in the Quarrel with his Brother  Artaxerxes  Thereupon  Xenophon  chose to return again into  Persia  where he join'd  Agesilaus  and there they contracted a strict Friendship which continu'd as long as they liv'd Upon which of these two Expeditions it was that the Sentence of Banishment was pass'd against him is not determin'd But he had by both of them incurr'd the Displeasure of his FellowCitizens  who look'd upon him as not being well affected to the Interest of his Country He has not by his Actions given any Marks of his Enmity against it But it is certain that he was a great Admirer of the  Spartan  Manners and Constitution and had a very indifferent Opinion of the  Athenian Democracy  Upon his second Return into  Greece  he resided at  Scillonte  a Town in the  Elean  Territory but at that Time under the Dominion of  Sparta  But upon the Invasion of  Laconia  by  Epaminondas  he quitted that Neighbourhood and retir'd to  Corinth  where he spent the Remainder of his Days It is to the Leisure he enjoy'd in these Places of Retreat that we owe most of his Historical and other Writings by which he appears to have possess'd more different Talents and to have been more thoroughly accomplish'd than any Man of his Time not only as a Captain Philosopher Orator and Historian but being likewise well skill'd in Politicks in Horsemanship and Hunting in Tillage and Planting He had also the Advantage of a very beautiful Person with a pleasing Aspect which bespoke that Candour and Simplicity for which he was so remarkable both in his Manners and his Writings  His Character as an Historian having already been describ'd in the Account I have given of the Authors from whom this History is collected I will here only add an Observation that he was the first Philosopher in  Greece  who wrote an  History And to this it may be ascrib'd that he has express'd Nature better than most other Historians of his Time His Conceptions were clear and that made his Diction so This regular way of thinking and digesting his Matter he learnt of  Socrates  under whom he studied Nothing is more to be admir'd in him than the Affection he bore to his Master And in this Part  Plato  agreed with him but there was otherwise no good Understanding between them Which is the more extraordinary because they were both equally of a mild and amiable Disposition and had no Enemies but such as their Virtue had created them The Cause assign'd by  Diogenes Laertius  for their Disagreement was a Rivalship in their Writings and in supprot of this Opinion it is said that  Xenophon  wrote his  Cyripaedia  as the Picture of a just Monarchy in Opposition to that which  Plato  had drawn of a perfect Commonwealth It is a Question among the Learned how far this Piece of  Xenophon  will bear being examin'd according to the strict Rules of History and whether it ought not rather to be look'd upon only as a more modest and instructive Species of Romance There is likewise great Allowance to be made for his Character of  Ageslaus  which is too much in the Stile of Panegyrick But his close Intimacy with that Prince had made him partial to his Failings He extols his personal Bravery and his other private Virtues and very justly  But he does not consider him enough in his publick Capacity as one who upon the Merit of his Services had got more Power into his Hands than was usually allow'd to the  Spartan  Kings and by his Rashness and Obstinacy had made an ill use of it almost to the Destruction of his Country  When  Philip  had made some proper Regulation of his Affairs at home he began to look abroad in order to divert the Storms which threaten'd him from all Quarters By Mony and Promises he made up Matters for the present with such of his Enemies as lay nearest to him and then turn'd his Forces against the  Athenians  Philip defeats the Athenians  who were march'd up to  Methone  to assist  Argaeus  He gave them Battle and defeated them and the Death of  Argaeus  who was kill'd in the Action put an End to that Dispute For he permitted the  Athenians  when they were in his Power to return home This Instance of his Moderation gain'd so far upon them that they soon after concluded a Peace with him which yet he observ'd no longer than it serv'd his Design of securing the other Part of his Dominions  Accordingly he march'd Northward  Olymp Subdues the Paeonians and the Illyrians  where he broke with the  Paeonians  and subdu'd them then fell upon the  Illyrains  and having kill'd above seven thousand of them in a pitch'd Battle oblig'd them to restore all their Conquests in  Macedonia  He had also shut up the Passage of  the  Thracians  but yet did not think it sufficiently secur'd without making himself Master of  Amphipolis  which was very commodiously situated on the River  Strymon  and was the  Key  of that Side of his Dominions  Seizes Amphipolis  He knew the Importance of it and therefore possess'd himself of it in the Beginning of his Reign This was the Grounds of his Quarrel with the  Athenians  who claim'd it as one of their Colonies and made such a Point of it that their setting up  Argaeus  against him was not so much for his own Sake or for the Credit of imposing a King upon the  Macedonians  as it was with a View to get the City restor'd to them by his Means in case he should have succeeded in his Pretensions  Philip  was sensible of their Drift and finding it necessary at that Time to keep some Measures with them would neither keep the Place himself nor let them have it but took a middle Course and declar'd it a Free City thereby leaving the Inhabitants to throw off their Dependence on their old Masters and making it appear to be their own Act But the City continu'd no longer in this State than till he found himself at liberty to make a more thorough Conquest of it which at this Time he easily effected  Olymp  thro' the Remissness of the  Athenians  who refus'd to send any Relief to it alledging in their Excuse that it would be a Breach of the Peace which they had concluded with  Philip  the Year before But the Truth is he trick'd them out of it by a Promise  of delivering it up to them But instead of keeping his Word with them he made further Encroachments by seizing on  Pydna  and  Potidea  the latter of which being garrison'd by  Atbenians  he drew them out and sent them home but dismiss'd them with such Marks of Civility as shew'd that he avoided coming to an open Rupture with that State at least till his Designs were more ripe for it tho' at the same time he did what he could to weaken them and drive them out of his Neighbourhood  Pydna and Potidaea  Pydna  with the Territory belonging to it he gave up to the  Olynthians  who were his Father's inverterate Enemies His Hands were too full at this time to revive the Quarrel against so rich and powerful a City whcih for three Years together had withstood the united Forces of  Sparta  and  Macedonia  he therefore chose to buy their Friendship for the present and to amuse them by the Delivery of this Town as he had done the  Athenians  by the Peace till he could attack them at more Advantage In this Step also he overreach'd the  Athenians  who were at the same time courting the Alliance of the  Olynthians  in order to maintain their sooting in those Parts Which Side soever the  Olynthians  inclin'd to they were strong enough to turn the Balance and therefore the gaining them became a Matter of great Contention between  Philip  and the  Athenians  The next Place he took  and Crenidae which be called Philippi  was  Crenidae  which he enlarg'd and call'd after his own Name  Philippi  and which afterwards was famous for the defeat of  Brutus  and  Cassius  There were near this Town some gold Mines which he work'd and drew out of them an immense Treasure The yearly Produce of them amounted to a thousand Talents which was reckon'd at that time considerably more than the Revenue of  Athens  and yet that was thought the richest State in  Greece  This was a very lucky Discovery for one who knew the Value and Use of Mony so well as he did He was by this means enabled to keep up a good Body of mercenary Troops at home with a great Number of Spies and Pensioners abroad and it was to this Fund that he ow'd a great Part of the Successes of his Reign  Philip  in this Progress of his Affairs met with little Opposition from the  Athenians  who had enough to do to support their Jurisdiction in other Parts  Factions in Eubaea compos'd by the Athenians  Euboea  being at this time divided into Factions one Party had recourse to them and the other to the  Thebans  who by this means got footing in the Island But the  Athenians  thought it of too great Importance to them to be given up For besides other Advantages they had formerly drawn a large Revenue from it However they did not exert themselves so vigorously as the Case requir'd 'till they were spirited up by  Timotheus What  said he  The  Thebans  in  Eubaea  and you still here They are in Action and you are  deliberating You have not spread the Seas with your Shipping you are not running down to the  Piraeus  you are not under Sail  This Manner of haranguing had the Effect he propos'd In five Days time they made the necessary Preparations and put to Sea forc'd the  Thebans  off the Island compos'd the Differences of the Inhabitants and brought them again under their Dependence  Demosthenes  takes particular notice of this Speech of  Timotheus  and quotes this Part of it as an Incentive to the  Athenians  upon a like Occasion when  Philip  was overrunning their Dominions in  Thrace  The  Athenians  had no sooner put an end to these Disturbances but  Byzantium  with the Islands of  Chios Cos  and  Rhodes  The Social War  revolted and confederated against them and from thence gave rise to that which was call'd  The War of the Allies  or  The Social War  They forthwith sent out  Chares  and  Chabrias  with Men and Shipping to reduce them Their first Attempt was upon  Chios  where  Chabrias  who commanded at Sea forc'd his Entrance into the Harbour  Attempt upon  Chios    but being deserted by the rest of the Fleet which put back to Sea he was immediately surrounded by the Enemy who beat upon him on all sides 'till his Ship was quite disabled and pierc'd through with the Enemies Beaks Whereupon the Men on board leap'd into the Sea to save themselves by swimming But he not thinking  it consistent with his Honour and the Duty of his Post to quit his Ship stood obstinately in the Defence of it 'till he was mortally wounded  Chabrias kill'd  Nepos  says contrary to the general Account of this Expedition that he served in it only as a private Man which if it were so would be the best Excuse that could be made for his Conduct in it For considering him as a Commander  His Character  it was certainly too unconcerted and too rash and desperate an Enterprise to be justified But it was agreeable to a Maxim of his own  That an Army of Stags led by a Lion was more formidable than an Army of Lions led by a Stag  He had another Maxim which shew'd more Prudence and Circumspection  That He was the best Commander who knew best what his Enemies were doing  However the Spirit he shew'd upon this Occasion with the many other Instances of his Bravery and Zeal for the Service of his Country may be sufficient to rank him with the Patriots of the best Ages of  Greece  Chares  with the LandForces had made some slight Attacks upon the Island but upon the Death of his Colleague he drew them off and put an end to the Campaign  Olymp  But the next Year great Preparations were made on both Sides for prosecuting the War with Vigour And the Allies having got together a Fleet of an hundred Sail harass'd and plunder'd several of the Islands under the Dominion of  Athens  and then besieg'd  Samos  Samos besieg'd by the Allies  The  Athenians  sent out  Chares  again with sixty Gallies and then reinforc'd them with sixty more under the Command of  Iphicrates  and  Timotheus  who were join'd in Commission with him They united their Forces and agreed to besiege  Byzantium  which drew the Allies from Samos to relieve it Hereupon the two Fleets met in the  Hellespont  But just as they were ready to engage there happen'd a violent Storm notwithstanding which  Chares  propos'd to proceed and join Battle but could not prevail with his Colleagues to come into it  Chares accuses his Colleagues of Treachery  whereupon he wrote to  Athens  to accuse them of Treachery and they were recall'd and order'd to answer it to the State  Chares  was now at liberty to act without Controul but instead of pursuing his Designs against the Islanders  and goes into Foreign Service  he went over to  Artabazus  the  Persian  Governor of some of the Provinces of  Asia minor  who had revolted from his Master and was reduced almost to the last Extremity by an Army of seventy thousand Men which was sent out against him  Chares  upon a Promise of being well rewarded engaged to assist him and having accordingly join'd their Forces they deseated the  Persians  But the King was so incens'd at it that he threaten'd to fit out a Fleet of three hundred Sail to support the Islanders in their War with the  Athenians  which so intimidated them that they  clapt up a Peace with the Allies upon their own Terms  Olymp A Peace with the Allies  which were  That for the future they should remain free and independent  This put an end to the  Social War  which had continued three Years tho' with very little Action on either Side at least not suitable to the Preparations that were made for it  The News of this Expedition of  Chares  was at first very well receiv'd by the Government of  Athens  in regard the Troops which were employ'd in it were paid by  Artabazus  and that indeed was the only pretence that could be made for undertaking it But when they found in what manner the  Persian  King resented it they made it a Charge of Treason against  Chares  for having exceeded his Commission  Chares accus'd but acquitted  and deserted the Service of his Country However he found means to secure a Party among the People who brought him off  Iphicrates  and  Timotheus  were more hardly dealt with  Iphicrates and Timotheus tried  and for that which had much les  the Appearance of a Crime in refusing to join with him in rushing headlong upon the Enemy in a Storm and combating the Elements But this Matter was so aggravated by  Chares  that they underwent a formal Trial for it and besides the revoking their Commissions had an heavy Fine impos'd on them This is the Account  Diodorus Siculus  gives of it But the Fact is by others related differently  and with more remarkable Circumstances  Timotheus fined  That  Timotheus  was fined an hundred Talents which being unable to pay he withdrew himself to  Chalcis  where he died The People soon after repenting of their Usage of him as it was generally the Case with them when it was too late remitted nine Parts of the Fine but exacted the other ten Talents of his Son  Conon  towards the Repair of their Walls It was an odd Circumstance and a Reproach to  Athens  that those Walls which had been rebuilt by  Conon  the Grandfather out of the Spoils l  e had taken from the Enemy should now be repair'd by a Fine unjustly rais'd upon  Conon  the Grandson  Iphicrates  apprehending the same Fate with  Timotheus  had introduced a Number of young Men into the Court arm'd with Daggers which they every now and then in the course of the Trial took care to expose to the View of his Judges in order to intimidate them This Menace had the Effect he propos'd and accordingly he was acquitted  I  hicrates acqu  tted  Being afterwards reproach'd with so violent a Proceeding he said  It would have been a Madness in him if after having succeeded in War for his FellowCitizens he should not have endeavour'd to do the same for himself  And certainly whatever Insult it was upon the publick Justice it was owing to the People themselves who by their capricious jealous and ungratesul Behaviour  towards their Generals had forc'd them to these Extremities For whatever their Conduct were they never knew when they were safe They were no longer regarded than they were wanted and when their Service was over it was approv'd or censur'd according as the Faction for or against them prevail'd In short they lay at the Mercy of every little designing  Demagogue  who had Art enough to inflame the Multitude Under these Discouragements it is not to be wonder'd at that many of them engag'd themselves in Foreign Service or went into a voluntary Exile insomuch that there were scarce any left to command at home This is to be look'd upon as one principal Cause of the Decay of the Power of  Athens  which began now too visibly to appear  Nepos  seems to fix it to this Period of Time and observes that  Chabrias Iphicrates  and  Timotheus  were the last of the  Athenian  Captains However it must be confess'd there were several considerable Men after them who occasionally signaliz'd themselves in the Defence or other necessary Service of their Country But it is certain there was not any Number or regular Succession of such as were able to keep up the ancient Spirit and Discipline of the Troops or the Grandeur of the Commonwealth  As to  Iphicrates  whether after his Trial he declined the Service or was laid aside by the  State we hear no more of his being employ'd either at home or abroad and yet he is said to have liv'd to a good old Age However  Diodorus  says he was dead when the great Battle of  Cehron√™a  was fought in the hundred and tenth  Olympiad  but without mentioning the Time and Circumstances of his Death and therefore we may reasonably suppose that he spent the Remainder of his Days in some  bscure Retirement  Character of Iphicrates  But whatever became of him he was at this time a great Loss to the Publick He had served on many Occasions and generally with Success which was chiefly  wing to his Skill and Prudence and his Service had been very useful and seasonable He was not so much noted for the Fame of his Exploits as for his Art and Improvements in the military Discipline wherein he was very exact and withal severe He was always upon his Guard and left as little room for Ac  idents as possible To this purpose when one ask'd him why he fortify'd his Camp which he had pitch'd in a Country belonging to his Confederates he replied  The worst Speech a General can make is I did not think  His Men were so perfect in their Exercise and so obedient to Command that when the Word was given to engage they knew their Business and did it of themselves as if every private Man had been directed by the ablest Ossicer This was particularly experienc'd in the War  at  Corinth  where he put a stop to the Progress of  Agesilaus  who would otherwise have overrun the States which were then in Alli ance with  Athens  The Men who served under him were known by the Name of th  Iphicratensian Troops  and were in the same degree of Esteem in  Greece  as the  Fabian  Sol  diers were in  Rome  He compared the several Parts of an Army to those of an human Body making the lightarm'd Infantry answer to the Hands the Cavalry to the Feet the main Body to the Breast and the General t  the Head He chang'd the Fashion of th  Arms and Accoutrements then in use contriving them chiefly for Ease and Expedition and after such a manner as should most effectually answer the Ends either of annoying or guarding against the Enemy But notwith standing these Proofs of his Diligence and Application he is said to have been naturally in dolent and impatient which does not seen very consistent with the Character of a Man who had work'd his way into the World and rais'd himself from nothing For he was of very mean Extraction some say a Shoemaker's Son and yet he carried it off with good Air when being reproach'd with it b  one of his Adversaries who was descended fro  Harmodius  'Tis true said he  The Lustre of  Family begins in me and that of yours ends  you  The first thing that brought him in  Repute was that in an Action wherein he was wounded he caught up one of his Encmies and carried him alive and in his Armour to his own Ship Besides the Advancement he made by his personal Merit he had the good Fortune to obtain in Marriage a Daughter of  Cotys  King of  Thrace  by whom he had a Son call'd  Menestheus  who yet seem'd to value himself more upon being the Son of an  Alhenian  Captain than of a  Thracian  Princess For being ask'd  To which of his Parents  e thought  e ow'd the greatest Obligation  he answer'd  To my Mother for that my Father did what he could to make me a  Thracian  but my Mother's Part was to make me an  Athenian  Iphicrates  in addition to his warlike Talents had the Reputation of a good Speaker But  Plutarch  blames him for going out of his Province and says he made himself ridiculous by getting Company to his House to declaim to them He likewise mentions an Instance of his being quite overpower'd by the Eloquence of his Antagonist But  Iphicrates  would not give it up  My Adversaries  said he  have the better Actor but mine is the better Play  Timotheus  Character of  Timotheus  in a War against this  Cotys  obtain'd great Booty to the Value of twelve hundred Talents which he deliver'd into the publick Treasury without reserving any Part of it to himself This was afterwards remember'd to the Shame of his Accusers when he  was fined an hundred Talents and forc'd to fly his Country because he was not able to pay it He was the more sensibly affected with this Misfortune because he had hardly known before what it was to suffer any He had generally succeeded in every thing he took in hand insomuch that some who envied him on that Score painted him asleep with Fortune by his Side and casting Nets over Cities He did not understand Raillery upon this head but insisted seriously That Fortune had no Share with him in his Victories but that they were owing intirely to his Merit  Hereupon  says Plutarch  The Goddess grew angry and forsook him  and adds  That from thenceforward nothing prosper'd with him  However in the main he was so successful that it is said the  Athenians  ow'd to him the Recovery of their Dominion at Sea He certainly contributed greatly towards it but his Father  Conon  had laid the Foundation of it by the Engagement at  Cnidus  after which there were other Circumstances concurr'd to the breaking the Power of the  Spartans  and it has been shewn in what manner the  Athenians  took advantage of the Necessity of their Affairs even when they were in Alliance with them against their common Enemics Besides the military Virtues of  Timotheus  wherein he was equal to his Father he was better skill'd in the Civil Part of the Administration He had by his Parts and Industry  attain'd to a good Degree of Knowledge of all kinds and excell'd particularly in the Art of speaking  In this first Year of the th  Olympiad Alexander the Great  was born On the same Day that  Philip  receiv'd the News of it he had an Account of a great Victory obtain'd by  Parmenio  his General against the  Illyrians  and likewise of his having gain'd the Prize in the  Olympick  Games Upon the Birth of his Son he wrote a Letter to  Aristotle  the Philosopher to acquint him with it and to recommend to him the Care of his Education which he did with the highest Compliment that could be made  I return Thanks to the Gods  said he  not so much for having given me a Son as for having given him me in the Age in which  Aristotle  lives  CHAP II  From the End of the Social War to the End of the Phocian War Containing the Space of Years  THE  Social  War was no sooner ended but another broke out of a longer Continuance and of much greater Consequence This was call'd The  Phocian  or  Sacred War  as being  rais'd and carried on upon a Motive  Religion and under that Pretence  Greece  be came by degrees universally involv'd in it The first Occasion of it arose from the  Phocians  Olymp The Grounds of the Phocian War  who having plough'd up a Piece of Ground belonging to the Temple of  Apollo  at  Delphi  their Neighbours exclaim'd against it as Sacrilege and it was adjudg'd so by the  Amphictyons  who were assembled as the  States General  of  Greece  for that purpose and an heavy Fine was impos'd on them Which being unable to pay they refus'd to submit to the Sentence alledging that the Care and Patronage of the Temple belong'd anciently to them and they quoted an Authority for it from  Homer  This Spirit of Opposition was rais'd by  Philomelus  a principal Man among them  Philomelus the Phocian General  who encourag'd them to take up Arms and acted as their General He first applied himself to the  Spartans  who had likewise been fined by the  Amphictyons  at the Instance of the  Thebans  after the Battle of  Leuctra  for having seiz'd the  Cadm√™a  For this reason they were very well dispos'd to join with him but did not yet think it proper to declare themselves However they encourag'd his Design and supplied him underhand with Mony by which means he rais'd Troops and without much Difficulty got possession of the Temple The chief Resistance he met with in the Neighbourhood  was from the  Locrians  but having worsted them he erased the Decree of the  Amphictyons  which was inscrib'd on the Pillars of the Temple However to strengthen his Authority and give a Colour to his Proceedings he thought it convenient to consult the Oracle and to procure an Answer in his Favour But when he applied to the Priestess for that Purpose she refus'd to officiate till being intimidated by his Threats she told him  The God left him at Liberty to act as be pleas'd  which he look'd upon as a good Answer and as such he took care to divulge it  This occasion'd another Assembly of the  Amphictyons  the Result whereof was a formal Decharation of War against the  Phocians  Greece divided in this War  And the Quarrel being now become more general the several States took Part in it according to their different Interests and Inclinations  Athens  and  Sparta  with some others of the  Peloponnesians  declar'd for the  Phicians  and the  Thebans Thessalians Locrians  and other neighbouring States against them  Philomelus  at his first setting out had made great Professions with regard to the Riches of the Temple which were immense that he would not touch any Part thereof and that he had no Design in making himself Master of the Temple but to restore the ancient Rights and Privileges of his Country But having now form'd his Alliances and being press'd for Mo  ny to support them he grew less scrupulous he broke into the Treasure and made it a Fund  for carrying on the War With this Supply he encreas'd the Pay of his Men and by that Encouragement got together a considerable Army He march'd with above ten thousand Horse and Foot against the  Locrians  The Transactions of the two first Years of it  and beat them not withstanding that they were supported by the  Thebans  He did the same by the  Thessalians  who were likewise join'd by their Neighbours But the  Thebans  at length coming up with thir+teen thousand Men put a Stop to his Progress As they had been the most active in procuring the Decree both against the  Spartans  and  Phocians  so they were now the most zealous and inveterate against them and pursu'd them wit  all the Rage and Rancour of a Religious War insomuch that having surpris'd a great Party o  the  Phocian  Mercenaries that was foraging the condemn'd and executed them as sacrilegiou  and accurs'd But the  Phocians  made Reprisal upon them and treating them in the same mar ner brought them to act more according to th  Law of Arms However the However the  Thebans  asterwar  had the Advantage of them in a woody Part  the Country and overpowering them with Nur  bers  lomelus    made a great Slaughter among them  Phlomelus  in the Pursuit was forc'd up a Precipic and drove to a Point of it where to avo falling into the Enemies Hands he threw him self headlong down the Rock tho'  Justin  say he was kill'd in the Battle But however the were he made so vigorous a Defence in tl  Action and had throughout conducted his Affairs so well that if his Cause had been better he might have been compar'd with the greatest Men of his Time But according to the Part he acted he was no otherwise look'd upon than as a bold and wicked Adventurer who stood in Defiance of Gods and Men and had involv'd his Country in a War to support him in his Impieties  These were the Transactions of the two first Years of the War during which time  Philip  was enlarging and securing his Frontier by taking in such Places as were either convenient for him or troublesome to him  Philip takes Methone and other Places  Of this latter kind was  Methone  which serving as a Refuge to his Enemies he took it by Storm and having demolish'd it annex'd the Lands to  Macedonia  During the Siege one of his Eyes was struck out with an Arrow and the Circumstance of it affected him more than the Wound itself For one  Aster  of  Amphipolis  having offer'd him his Service as an extraordinary Marksman who could take a Bird down flying  Well  said Philip  when I wage War with Sterlings I'll employ you  The Man was so nettled with this Answer that he threw himself into the Town and shot an Arrow at him with this Inscription on it  At  Philip'  s right Eye Philip  return'd it to him with another Inscription  That he would hang up  After  if he took the Town  and he was as good as his Word However he was so asham'd of this Accident that he did not  afterwards care to talk of an Eye and could no bear the mention of the Word  Cyclops  The  Thebans  concluding  Olymp Onomarchus succeeds Philomelus  that the Death  Philomelus  had deterr'd the  Phocians  from prose cuting the War withdrew their Forces But h  was succeeded by  Onomarchus  who was personally interested in carrying it on For the  Amphictyon  had laid several Fines upon him which he wa  not able to discharge He therefore gather'd up the Remains of the Army and recruited it For this Purpose he coin'd Mony with which he also confirm'd his Confederates and bought off some of his Enemies The  Thessalians  who were th  most formidable of them he engag'd to stand neuter But  Philip  soon after fix'd them in his Interest by freeing them from their Tyrants Their Case was that  Lycophron  of  Pherae  who succeeded his Brother  Alexander  after he had assisted in his Murther set out at first as their Deliverer and govern'd with Moderation busoon after treading in his Predecessors Steps the begg'd  Philip  's Assistance against him  Lycephron  at the same time had Recourse to the  Phocians  And thus by their Quarrel among the  selves they were drawn again into the Gener  one  Onomarchus  therefore as well in Behalf  the Tyrant as to support the Cause of the  Phcians  began the Hostilities He took sever Places and invading  Boeotia  the  Thebans  wet again call'd out to stop his further Progress which they did with some Difficulty having ju  before sent five thousand Men under the Command of  Pammenes  to the Assistance of  Artabazus  in  Asia  where they had good Success and did Honour to their Country  Onomarchus  in the mean time gain'd great Advantages against  Philip  in two several Actions  His Successes against Philip  and struck such a Terror into his Men that he had much ado to bring them again into the Field However being reinforc'd it came to a general Battle with twenty thousand Men on each Side  But at length is defeated taken and executed  Six thousand on the Side of the  Phocians  were kill'd on the Spot and three thousand taken Prisoners Among the former was  Onomarchus  whose Body  Philip  caus'd to be hang'd up and the Prisoners he order'd to be thrown into the Sea as guilty of the Sacrilege This rais'd an Opinion of his Zeal for Religion which he knew how to make a right use of And it pass'd likewise for a Mark of his Justice and Generosity with respect to the  Thessalians  who were by this Means restor'd to their Liberty For  Lycophron  went off upon the general Rout and he and his Brother  Pitholaus  quitted  Pherae  tho' afterwards they appear'd again in Arms and endeavour'd by Means of the  Phocians  to be reinstated The  Thessalians  very well deserv'd this Piece of Service For the Success of the Battle was owing chiefly to their Horse which  Philip  was so sensible of that he took care to maintain a constant Friendship and Alliance with them  and they had a great Part in the successive Victories of his Reign  Onmarchus  was succeede in the Command by his Brother  Phayllus  Olymp Succeeded by his Brother Phayllus  who took the same Methods that his Predecessors had done to support himself He had a great Command of Mony which being distributed very liberally he encreas'd the Number of his Confederates and easily got a fresh Supply of Mercenaries with which he march'd into  Boeotia  but was worsted there in three several Engagements From thence he remov'd into  Locris  where he had more equal Success and after he had taken some Towns he was seiz'd with a lingering Illness of which he died  The Course of the War had like to have been interrupted by a Quarrel between the  Spartans  and the Inhabitants of  Megalopolis  The Spartans create fresh Disturbances  The latter being unable to defend themselves call'd in the  Argives Sicyonians  and  Messenians  to their Assistance and the  Thebans  afterwards joining them they became an overmatch for the  Spartans  who thereupon borrow'd three thousand Foot of the  Phocians  and  Lycophron  with his Brother  Pitholaus  came in to them with a small Party of Horse But notwithstanding these Preparations after the taking a Town or two which occasion'd some sharp Engagements wherein the  Spartans  at length had the better a Truce was agreed upon and the Armies separated  Upon the Death of  Phayllus  Phalecus succeeds Phayllus  the Command was given to  Phalecus  the Son of  Onomarchus  who being very young  Mnaseas  was assign'd to him as his Director and was kill'd in the first Action that happen'd However the War was continu'd by Skirmishes and mutual Incursions and Depredations The  Thebans  had in this piqueering way got a good deal of Plunder But as the Burthen of the War lay chiefly upon them they were so drain'd  Olymp  that they were reduc'd to the last Extremity and sending to the King of  Persia  for a Supply he readily furnish'd ther with three hundred Talents  Philip  had not as yet been directly engag'd in this War For what he had done against  Onomarchus  was only by Accident and in Consequence of his protecting the  Thessalians  against their Tyrants However his Success in that Action and the general Esteem he had gain'd by his other Exploits had now enlarg'd his Views and put him upon endeavouring to gain a footing in  Greece  Philip prevented in his Design upon Thermopylae  In order to it under a Pretence of marching against the  Phocians  he attempted to possess himself of the famous Pass in the Streights of  Thermopyl  e  which he call'd  The Key of  Greece But the  Athenians  who were more immediately expos'd by this Passage took the Alarm and prevented him so that he was forc'd to wait a more fit Opportunity In the mean time he pursu'd his Conquests at home enlarging his Frontier towards  Thrace  taking  Towns upon the  Hellespont  and making such further Encroachments on all Sides as might facilitate his great and principal Design of invading  Greece  The stopping his Progress at  Thermopylae  The Rise and Character of Demosthenes  was owing chiefly to  Demosthenes  who had began to distinguish himself soon after the Conclusion of the  Social War  when the  Athenians  were alarm'd at the great Preparations which were making in  Persia  He afterwards appear'd in Behalf of the  Megalopolitans  and  Rhodians  that they might be protected and supported against  Sparta  or  Thebes  or any other State which might by such an Accession give Umbrage to  Athens  and destroy the Balance of Power But he began now to exert himself in a more extraordinary manner and he had from this time forwards so great a Share in the Affairs of the Publick that a particular Account of him besides the doing Justice to the Character of so wonderful a Man may serve in a great measure to explain and illustrate the History of the Times he liv'd in The chief Regard that has been paid to his Memory has generally been on account of his Eloquence But he was likewise a very able Statesman and a good Patriot and considering the Embassies and Expeditions the Treaties and Alliances and other various Negotiations wherein he was employ'd together with the Zeal and Integrity with which he acted in them it may be question'd whether he did not excel as much in those Capacities a  in that of an Orator tho' it must be confess'd that his Art of Speaking was the Foundation of his other Merit or at least the Means of producing it to Advantage and improving it But notwithstanding that he arriv'd to such a Perfection in this Art he set out under great Disadvantages For he had an Impediment in his Speech with a weak Voice and a short Breath and a very uncouth and ungracious Manner however by Dint of Resolution and infinite Pains he overcame all these Defects He would climb up steep and craggy Places to help his Wind and strengthen his Voice he would declaim with Pebbles in his Mouth to remedy the Imperfection in his Speech he would place  LookingGlass before him to correct the Aukwardness of his Gesture and he learn'd of the best Players the proper Graces of Action and Pronunciation which he thought of so much Consequence that he made the whole Art of  ratory in a manner to consist of them But whatever Stress he laid upon the exterior Part of  peaking he was also very careful about the  atter and the Stile the latter of which he  orm'd upon the Model of  Thucydides  whose History for that Purpose he transcrib'd eight seeral times He was so intent upon his Study  at he would often retire in  o a Cave of the  arth and shave half his Head so that he could  ot with Decency appear abroad 'till his Hair  s grown again He also accustom'd himself  to harangue at the Sea Shore where the Agita tion of the Waves form'd to him an Idea of the Commotions in a popular Assembly and serv'd to prepare and fortify him against them  From these several Kinds of Hardship which he impos'd upon himself it is plain that he was not born an Orator but was rather an Instance how far Parts and Application may go towards the forming a great Man in any Profession To add to which he had a great deal of Ambition to spur him on and that which heighten'd it or rather gave the first Rise to it was a famous Cause in a Matter of Dispute concerning  Or  pus  whether that City belong'd to the  Attick  of  the  Theban  Frontier  Callistratus  who pleaded in Behalf of the  Athenians  succeeded well and receiv'd extraordinary Applause which so af fected  Demosthenes  that from that Instant tho  he was then but sixteen Years old he fix'd hi  Resolution and turn'd his Thoughts wholly th  way And indeed the Study of Oratory was a that Time the readiest and almost the only Means of rising in the State His first Essay at the Bar was two Years after this Incident when he call'd his Guardians to account for im bezzling his Patrimony and recover'd some Par of it This encourag'd him some time after a harangue before the People in their publick Assem bly but he acquitted himself so ill that they hiss'd him However he ventur'd a second time but with no better Success than before so th  he went away ashamed and confounded and quite in Despair It was upon this Occasion that  Satyrus  the Player accosted him and in a friendly way encourag'd him to proceed With this View he ask'd him to repeat to him some Verses of  Sophocles or Euripides  which he accordingly did the other repeated them after him but with such a different Spirit and Cadence as made him sensible that he knew very little of Elocution But by his Instructions and his own Perseverance he at length made himself master of it and by the Methods beforemention'd he corrected the Imperfections which were born with him as well as the ill Habits which he had contracted It is not very clear wheter this Passage be rightly ascrib'd to  Saty  us  who seems to be confounded with  Neoptolemus  and  Andronicus  who were likewise famous Comedians and  Demosthenes  is said to have been instructed by all three of them  With these Advantages and Improvements he appear'd again in publick and succeeded so well that People flock'd from all Parts of  Greece  to hear him From hence he was look'd upon as the Standard of true Eloquence insomuch that none of his Countrymen have been put in Comparison with him nor even among the  Romans  any but  Cicero  And tho' it has been made a Question by the ancient Writers to which of the two they should give the Preference they have not ventur'd to decide it but have contented  themselves with describing their different Beauties and shewing that they were both perfect in their kind But to confine myself to  Demosthenes  hi kind of Eloquence was grave and austere lik  his Temper but withal masculine and sublime bold forcible and impetuous abounding with Metaphors Apostrophes and Interrogations which with his solemn way of invoking and appealing to the Gods the Planets the Elements and the  Manes  of those who sell at  Salamis  and  Marathon  had such a wonderful Effect upon his Hearers that they thought him inspir'd If he had not so much Softness and Insinuation as is often requisite in an Orator it was not that he wanted Art and Delicacy when the Cafe requir'd it he knew how to found the Inclinations of the People and to lead them to the Point he aim'd at and sometimes by seeming to propose that which was directly contrary to it But his chief Characteristick was Vehemence both in the Action and Expression and indeed that was the Qualification of all others most wanted at this time For the People were grown so insolent and imperious so factious and divided so jealous of the Power of the  Democracy  and withal  e  n k into a State of Pleasure and Indolence that no Arts of Persuasion would have been so effectual as that Spirit and Resolution that Force and Energy of  Demosthenes  to humble them to unite them and to rouse them into a Sense of their common Danger  But neither could  Demosthenes  himself have made such Impressions on them if his Talent of speaking had not been supported by their Opinion of his Integrity It was that which added Weight and Emphasis to every thing he said and animated the Whole It was that which chiefly engag'd their Attention and determin'd their Counsels when they were convinc'd that he spoke from his Heart and had no Interest to manage but that of the Community And this he gave the strongest Proofs of in his Zeal against  Philip  who said  He was of more Weight against him than all the Fleets and Armies of the  Athenians and that  he had no Enemy but  Demosthenes He was not wanting in his Endeavours to corrupt him as he had most of the leading Men in  Greece  but he withstood all his Offers and  Plutarch  says  all the Gold of  Macedonia  could not bribe him  And yet as inflexible as he was to  Philip  he became more pliable in the Reign of his Successor and gave occasion to his Enemies to accuse him of Bribery for which he was fin'd and imprison'd and afterwards banish'd This Charge against him has by some been thought a malicious and groundless Calumny and the rather because he was not allow'd to justify himself But the Fact is so generally related by others and with so many Circumstances that it is not easily to be resuted The Case in short was That  Harpalus  an Officer of  Allexander's  having imbezzled a great Part of  the Treasure that he had been entrusted with made up a Purse and retir'd with it to  Athens  for Protection It was debated by the People whether they should admit him for fear of incurring his Master's Displeasure and involving themselves in a War and  Demosthenes  considering it in that Light oppos'd it  Harpalus  to remove all Difficulties dispers'd his Mony pretty liberally among the Orators and as he was displaying his Wealth  Demosthenes  happen'd to fix his Eyes on a rich Gold Cup of the King's and admiring the Sculpture and Fashion ask'd the Price of it  Harpalus  took the Hint and at Night sent it home to him together with twenty Talents in Mony The next Day he appear'd in the Assembly muffled up about his Throat and when he was expected to speak to the Point in Question he made Signs that he had lost his Voice But his Transaction with  Harpalus  had taken Wind and when he found himself detected he rose up to excuse it but the People were so enrag'd that they would not hear him Whereupon a certain Wag stood up and said  What will ye not hear the King's Cupbearer  Others said  Surely the Orator had not been seiz'd that Night with a Silver Squinzy  and they had coin'd a  Word on purpose to express it  Demosthenes  could not stand this Contempt and Raillery of his FellowCitizens who had hitherto esteem'd and respected him even to a Sort of Reverence and it affected him the more  because he had piqu'd himself so much more than others upon the Rigidness of his Virtue which indeed was the chief Foundation of that extraordinary Respect which had been paid him But the Itch of Mony had infected him and this was not the only instance of his receiving Presents in a clandestine and unwarrantable manner As a further Argument that he did not despise Mony he was reproach'd with dealing in Bottomry which in those Days was look'd upon as a scandalous way of Traffick And therefore  Zeno  who likewise practis'd it some time after him gave it up as a thing that would hurt the Credit of his Philosophy But however  Demosthenes  was in some Degree tainted with the general Corruption of the Times he does not seem to have lov'd Mony so much for its own Sake as to serve the Ends of his Ambition Wherein he copied after  Pericles  whom he likewise chose to imitate in his manner of speaking He had not the Command as the other had of the publick Mony and therefore was not in a Capacity of doing so many great and popular Acts But he repair'd the City Walls sitted out Ships ransom'd Slaves married poor Maidens entertain'd the People with Shews and Sports and did such other things of that kind as were within the Compass of his private Fortune And this seems the most plausible way of accounting for the Methods he took to get Mony and to improve it  But whatever might be alledg'd in his Excuse as to Mony Matters he had another Failing which by his own confession he was guilty of and that was want of Courage as will be more particularly related in its proper Place In the mean time I would only observe the strange Inconsistency in the Composition of this Great Man who with such Constancy and Intrepidity oppos'd all the Measures of the Foreign and Domestick Enemies of his Country and who so often at the Hazard of his Life brav'd the Madness of the People in their Assemblies and yet could not stand an Enemy in the Field  He chose  says Plutarch  to swear by those who fell at  Maratnon  tho' he could not follow their Example  And what is still more extraordinary he afterwards refus'd Life when it was offer'd him and Nobody died with greater Fortitude These Frailties which I have mention'd could not but take off a great deal from the Lustre of his Chaacter insomuch that  Phocion  who succeeded him tho' in several Respects he was not equal to him besides that he was suspected to favour the  Macedonian  Interest yet being more remarkable for his personal Justice and Valour he was therefore look'd upon as the greater Man However  Demosthenes  such as he was did more Service to the State than any of his Contemporaries He was the chief Bulwark not only of  Athens  but of  Greece  in general and almost the only Obstacle to  Philip's  Designs of enslaving  it Which leads us now into an Enquiry how those Designs were laid and how far they succeeded  The two next Years of the  Phocian  War pass'd without any memorable Action tho' it was still continu'd by Skirmishes and mutual Depredations  Philip  had now no Part in it But when he found himself shut out of  Greece  by the  Athenians  he turn'd his Arms against those remote Places which depended on them either as Colonies or as Conquests and particularly against the  Olynthians  whom he had long look'd upon with an evil Eye but had courted and cajoled them whilst he was otherwise employ'd But he came now resolv'd entirely to reduce 'em  Olymp Philip's Design upon Olynthus  and advancing towards the City only sent them a short Message to let them know  That one of these two Points was become necessary either that they must quit  Olynthus  or he  Macedonia Whereupon they sent immediately to  Athens  for Relief The Matter was debated there with great Solemnity and  Demosthenes  was very earnest in supporting their Demand  Demosthenes presses the Athenians to relieve it  In the doing whereof he took occasion to lay open the Designs and Practices of  Philip  inveighing against him with great Bitterness and urging every thing that might serve to incense the People against him He describ'd him as a proud tyrannical Usurper  Desertbes Philip  and a common Disturber of Mankind without Faith or Confidence without any Principle of Honour or Justice or any Regard to  Laws Human or Divine Then as to the Danger they might apprehend from him he represented him likewise as politick vigilant indefatigable intrepid and fortunate who fought as successfully with his Mony as his Sword and knew how to corrupt where he could not conquer But lest from this Account of him he should appear so formidable to the People that they might be discourag'd from endeavouring to stop his Progress he shew'd him in another Light as vain presumptuous rash and imprudent forming Schemes without any Foundation and measuring the Vastness of his Designs only by the Standard of his Ambition From these different Views of him which were varied according to the different Impressions that were to be made upon the People we may collect almost the whole of his Character But the Orator in framing this Picture of him must be said to have drawn the Lines a little too strong and to have heighten'd the Colours too much by the Warmth of his Zeal and the Force of his Elocution And yet these Exaggerations were necessary at this Time in order to inflame the People For  Philip  had his Partizans among the Orators who combated and oppos'd every thing that was urg'd against him  One of the ablest and most zealous of them  Character of Demades  was  Demades  who was very ready and acute and remarkable for speaking  extempore  as any Occasion offer'd Herein he had manifestly the  Advantage of  Demosthenes  whose Works were said  to smell of the Lamp  And hence it was that  Theophrastus  being ask'd his Opinion of the two Orators answer'd  That  Demosthenes  was worthy of the City of  Athens  but that  Demades  was above it  However  Demosthenes  had upon some very important Occasions succeeded well in the unpremeditated way of haranguing but it being not his usual Method nor his natural Talent he discouraged the Practice of it And therein he made use of an artful Argument That to speak before the People in an abrupt manner and without due Preparation was not treating them with Respect that it had somewhat of an  Oligarchical  Principle in it and was rather bearing them down by Force than winning them by Persuasion As to  Demades  whatever his Wit and Parts were he was very mercenary and corrupt And when he was charg'd with it he said  He had often spoke against himself but never against his Country  But there is an Instance recorded of him wherein he seem'd rather to value himself upon it than to excuse it For meeting one day with a Player who had receiv'd a Talent as a Reward for a Part that he had excell'd in  It is not so extraodinary  said Demades  to have one Talent given you for speaking I had Ten given me for holding my Tongue  His prostituting himself in this manner was chiefly to support his Luxury For he was naturally profuse and gluttonous and  hence it was that when he was grown old  Antipater  compar'd him to a sacrificed Beast of which all the Parts were consum'd but the Tongue and the Paunch He was sometimes upon good Terms with  Demosthenes  according as it serv'd his present Purpose but the Rivaiship in their Profession with the different Cast of their Tempers and their Politicks made it impracticable for them to live in any real Friendship On the contrary they were generally at Variance and at length it came to an open Enmity which in the Sequel will appear to have cost  Demosthenes  his L  e  Another of the same Stamp with  Demades  and of Hyperides  was  Hyperides  both as to his Parts and Principles and his riotous Manner of living He had a more premeditated way of speaking but with the same kind of Wit and Acrimony tho' he was not so quick He is generally rank'd with  Demosthenes  and is mention'd as one of the Ten Principal Orators of that Age tho'  Plutarch  does not reckon him in that Number He took a great deal of pains to ingratiate himself with the People and had no Ties of Faith or Friendship but as they serv'd that End However he was not much in the Administration of Affairs 'till the Reign of  Alexander  And then he acted such a double Par  between the Patriot and the Traitor that he was at last ensnar'd by his own Politicks and sell a Sacrifice to the Resentment of  An  pater  Such were most of the leading Men in the Assemblies and such was generally their End To carry on their own private Views they inflamed the People and deluded them with false Colours 'till they had drawn them either into an unnecessary War or a bad Peace But sooner or later they suffer'd for it and were either made particular Marks of Vengeance or involved in the common Ruin of their Country This was more remarkably the Case at  Athens  which had been always look'd upon as the chief Seat of Eloquence and never abounded with so many eminent Speakers as at this time But that which was the Glory of this Commonwealth must at the same time be consider'd as one principal Cause that hasten'd its Downfall and drew along with it that of the other  Grecian  States  But to return to  Demosthenes  his steady and uniform Conduct supported him for many Years against  Demades  and the rest of his Antagonists and he got the better of them in the present Case of the  Olynthians  tho' he was not able to obtain such seasonable and effectual Relief for them as the Necessity of their Affairs required notwithstanding that he press'd it with all the Skill and Arguments that he was Master of  Demosthenes still presses the R  l  ef of Olynthus  He told the People how much they were oblig'd in Justice and Honour to support their Allies and how much their own Safety depended on it for that if  Olynthus  should be taken the next Attempt would be upon  Athens  He reproach'd them with their In  sensibility and Sloth to which he chiefly ascrib'  all  Philip's  Greatness and caution'd them agains  the Treachery and Enchantment of their Ora tors He advis'd them to reform Abuses to restore the Ancient Order and Discipline to serve in the Wars in person as they had for  merly done to lay aside their private Ani  mosities to unite against  Philip  as their com  mon Enemy and to furnish the necessary Supplies  But this latter was the great Point in question and that which had occasion'd most of their late Dissensions the Fund for the Wa  as has before been observ'd having been ap  plied to the Use of the Stage The Mony arising from this Fund was computed at a thou  sand Talents a Year and a certain Proportior of it was allotted to the Citizens to defra  the Charge of their Admittance into the The atre This Distribution having been continue  to them from the Time of  Pericles  they claim'  it now as their Right especially since they ha  lately obtain'd a Law which made it capital t  propose the restoring the Fund to the Uses so which it was originally granted Hence it was that upon any pressing Emergency extraordi  +nary Taxes were to be rais'd and they wer  laid so unequally and collected with so muc  Difficulty that they seldom answer'd the Se  vice for which they were intended The wealthier Sort complain'd that the Burthen lay wholly upon them and that the Publick Mony was squander'd away in Shews and Festivals for the Entertainment of the lower Rank of the Citizens who fat at their Ease and contributed nothing to the Support of the Publick either in their Purse or their Persons They retorted upon the Rich that they enjoy'd all the Honours and great Offices of the State exclusive of the common People and as they had the Law on their Side with Numbers to support it they gave little Attention to any Remonstrances that were made upon this Head  Demosthenes  who had nothing in view but the General Good thought it necessary to sound the People upon this Subject and enter'd as far into it as he could with Safety He propos'd that Commissioners should be appointed to inspect the Laws in general not in order to make new Ones for that there were already too many but that such of them as should be sound prejudicial to the Publick might be abolished At the same time he urg'd the present Necessity of raising Forces and mentioned the  Theatrical Mony  as the only proper Fund for it In Conclusion he told them plainly that the Law relating to it ought to be repeal'd However he took care to deliver it only as his Opinion without proposing it in form so as to subject himself to the Penalty  This was the Substance of the three famous Orations of  Demosthenes  upon occasion of three several Applications that the  Olynthians  made to  Athens  for Succours The first of them produced no Effect in their behalf Upon the second  Chares  was dispatch'd to them with thirty Gallies and two thousand Men But these being Hirelings and Strangers did them very little Service Which occasion'd theird Application wherein they desired true  Athenian  Troops whom they could better depend on And accordingly  Chares  was sent out again with seventeen Gallies and a Body of two thousand Foot and three hundred Horse compos'd intirely of the Citizens of  Athens  But the  Olynthians  continued block'd up and whatever Benefit they might have received from this last Sapply they were prevented by  Philip  who by the Correspondence he held in the Town had corrupted  Euthycrates  and  Lasthenes  the two chief Magistrates  Olynthus be  ay'd to Philip  who betray'd it into his hands He enter'd and plunder'd it and sold the Inhabitants among the rest of the Booty He also found in it his two Bastard Brothers whom he put to death as he formerly had the other of them being jealous of their supplanting him in the Throne This Circumstance of his Brothers is related only by  Justin  who also makes the harbouring them in the Town the Pretence for  Philip's  investing it He found in it Abundance of Treasure  which he reserv'd as a Fund for the gaining other Places in the same manner In the mean time he shew'd extraordinary Marks of Joy for the taking  Olynthus  as a Place of the greatest Importance He celebrated publick Games gave Shews and Festivals and made Presents to those who assisted at them  One of the remarkable Occurrences of this first Year of the th  Olympiad  Death and Character of Plato  was the Death of  Plato  which happen'd suddenly in the midst of an Entertainment that he had made for his Friends upon his Birthday which compleated the Eighty first Year of his Age By his Father's Side he was of Royal Extraction and by his Mother he was descended from  Solon  But he is not so much taken notice of for his high Birth as for the Figure he made in the World by his Philosophy He was a Scholar of  Socrates  but was more lively and fer  le in his Imagination more sublime and flo  d in his Diction and more copious and extensive in his Matter Instead of consining himself after his Example to the Study of Mo  ality only he took in the whole Compass of  hilosophy and had distinct Masters for each  rticular Branch of it To add to the Im  rovements he made under them he travell'd  nto  Italy Sicily Aegypt  and  Persia  In  In Aegypt  he  suppos'd to have been made acquainted with the  ooks of  Moses  by means of the  Jews  who were  try numerous there after the Captivity Hence it  was that  Clemens Alexandrinus  call'd him the  Attick Moses  And he appears in several Part  of his Works to have had some distinct No  tions of a supreme Being and of the Immor  tality of the Soul Some have pretended bu  upon a very shallow Foundation to discove  in him an Idea of the Trinity and other My  steries of Christianity But whatever Senti  ments he had above the common receiv'd Notions of the Religion of his Country the Example of  Socrates  had deterr'd him from de  claring himself too planly and therefore h  chose in the way of Dialogue to couch hi  Opinions under the Names of others But some say it was his extreme Modesty and Diff  dence of himself and the great Veneration he paid to his Master that made him imitate him in this Manner of writing and that for these Reasons it was that  Socrates  is made to speak wha  Plato  thought His Method of explaining thing  by Numbers he learnt in the  Pythagrorean  School in  Italy  and his manner of expressing him  self by Allegories and Symbols he took from the  Aegyptians  But those Parts of his Wri  tings appeear too mysterious and refined as doe  likewise his Doctrine of Ideas which notwith standing the many long Dissertations of th  Learned upon it seems to have been very littl  understood Upon his Return from his Tra  vels he was courted to take a part in the Go  vernment but he chose to lead a quiet and  contemplative Life and he pursued his Studies to the last Day of it The teaching Philosophy being at this time esteem'd very honourable he set up his School in the  Academy  just without the City and from thence he was stiled  The Founder of the Academick Sect  That he had no regard to the gainful Part of his Profession is plain from his Contempt of Riches For he divided his Estate which was very considerable among his Brothers reserving to himself only a little CountrySeat with a small Garden Notwithstanding his Application to Study he had none of that Gloominess and Austerity in his Temper which was common to most of his Profession On the contrary he was chearful and facetious and sometimes lov'd Raillery but it was always inoffensive and with good Manners and only to enliven the Conversation He prescrib'd the same Rules of Behaviour to his Scholars and hence it was that he recommended it so strongly to them  To sacrifice to the Graces  He was as universally belov'd and caress'd for his engaging Manner and the Easiness of his Temper as he was esteem'd and admir'd for his Knowledge After his Death Kings and Commonwealths erected Statues and dedicated Altars to him so that his Memory became sacred his Doctrine was establish'd and he has pass'd both with Pagans and Christians under the Name of  The Divine Plato  During the Transactions at  Olynthus  the  Phocian  War was continued But such a terrible Havock was made of the Treasure of the Temple that the  Phocians  themselves being at length grown asham'd of it appointed Commissarie  to inquire into it and turn'd  Phalecus  out o  the Command however he was restor'd to i  again after Justice had been done on those wh  had been employ'd as his Agents  Olymp The Punishment of those who had rifled the Temple  The Bull of the Mony had been entrusted with one  Phil  who was condemn'd and rack'd to death I  the Extremity of his Torture he named man  of his Accomplices who were likewife put t  death notwithstanding that they had given u  what was remaining in their Hands The Va  lue of what had been risled in the Course o  the War in Mony and rich Presents with o  ther things dedicated to the Use of the Tem  ple amounted in the whole to above ten thou  sand Talents which was an immense Sum and is said to be more than  Alexander  afterward found in the Treasury of the  Persians  Philip  had for the most part affected to ob  serve a Neutrality in this Quarrel But by th  small Part he had already acted in it it wa  easily seen that he intended to do more I  the mean time he left the contending Parties t  harass and weaken one another that he migh  afterwards fall in with those who could be  most use to him and the Case happen'd no  according to his Expectations For the  Theban  were so exhausted with the War that they were not able to carry it on to any Advantage and therefore had recose to him for his Assistance  The Thebans call in Philip to their Assistance  which he made no Difficulty of granting them This was a very lucky Circumstance for the promoting his Views but it was the most fatal Step the  Thebans  could have taken both with regard to themselves and the rest of  Greece  The ill Consequences of it  Their calling in one who was as yet to be look'd upon as a Foreigner and who only waited such an Opportunity was sacrificing every thing to their Obstinacy and Inveteracy against the  Phocians  it was giving up all those Marks of Superiority which they pretended to upon the Credit of their Victories under  Epaminondas  in short it was consigning themselves over to Slavery and forging their own Chains And with regard to the Publick the Consequences will appear to be still worse The  Thessalians  who had been inveigled by  Philip  ever since his Accession to the Throne were prevail'd upon to join in this new Confederacy And afterwards several other  Grecian  States when they sound themselves oppress'd by their Neighbours applicd to  Philip  for Relief as to a common Friend and Protector But this was not 'till he had a more immediate Influence in their Affairs by being admitted into the Assembly of the  Ampictyons  besides it was the  Thebans  who set them the Example and who are therefore  to be look'd upon as the principal Betrayers of the Liberties of  Greece  But tho'  Philip  had enter'd into these Engagements with the  Thebans  he consider'd that the  Phocians  were supported both by  Athens  and  Sparta  and therefore proceeded with Caution and Secrecy and took time to form his Measures accordingly Amidst these Deliberations it happen'd just as he could have wish'd that the  Athenians  being grown weary of a War which was so far from turning to their account that it only gave  Philip  a better Opportunity of wresting from them their Possession in  Thrace  had therefore sent to sound him upon a Peace  Athens negotiates a Peacewith Philip  Ctesiphon  and  Phrynon  who were employ'd in this Commission made their Report that he was not at all averse to it and thereupon  Demosthenes  with nine others were sent as Ambassadors to negotiate it They went as far in it as they were authoriz'd by their Instructions and return'd with  Antipater parmenio  and  Eurylochus  on the Part of  Philip  Soon after the Ten were dispatch'd back again with full Powers to put the last Hand to the Treaty  Demosthenes  in the first of these Embassies had met with some  Athenian  Prisoners in  Macedonia  whom he had promis'd to redeem at his own Expence and he took the present Opportunity for it In the mean time his Colleagues were to proceed with all Expedition in order to conclude with  Philip  but  they loiter'd by the way and were three Months in  Macedonia  before they had Access to  Philip  who was all that time ravaging the  Athenian  Dominions in  Thrace  When at last they got up to him he agreed to the Terms of the Treaty but still upon one Pretence or other deferr'd the Execution of it 'till at length being advanc'd with his Troops into  Thessaly  in order to proceed against the  Phocians  he found it necessary to conclude with the  Athenians  which at last is concluded  and accordingly ratified the Treaty  By these Delays which he gain'd by bribing all the Ambassadors in general except  Demosthenes  he had kept the  Athenians  in suspence 'till his other Designs were ripe for Execution However as the Peace was at last concluded the Generality of the People were well satisfy'd with it and the Ambassadors at their Return  Aeschines vouches for Philip's Promises  valued themselves upon the Success of their Negotiations  Aeschines  in particular who was one of them and was intirely devoted to  Philip  expatiated largely upon his Candour and Sincerity and vouch'd for his Performance of several things which he had promis'd in behalf of the Republick altho' they were not stipulated by the Treaty as that  Thespiae  and  Plataea  should be repeopled that in case he should subdue the  Phocians  he would not destroy them that he would put the  Thebans  upon a reasonable footing that  Oropus  should be secured to the  Athenians  and that  Euboea  should be given up  to them as an Equivalent for  Amphipolis  Demosthenes gives no Credit to them  Demosthenes  endeavour'd with his usual Frankness to convince the People how little Stress there was to be laid upon these Promises of  Philip  which he said were made only to amuse them and to divert them from his real Design which was to make himself Master of  Phocis  and that their suffering him to succeed in that would be giving up every thing But all that he could say upon this Occasion had no weight with them They were willing to be deceiv'd and  Aeschines  knew how to work upon their Credulity He was in the first Rank of Orators and disputed the Prize even with  Demosthenes  Account of the Contest between him and Aeschines  of which there was a famous Instance in the Contest concerning the Crown wherein the Abilities of these two great Men were display'd in their highest Lustre and engaged the Attention of all the learned Men of  Greece  The Case in short was That  Demosthenes  among other necessary Works that were committed to his Charge had the care of repairing the City Walls which he did partly at his own Expence and the People in Testimony of their Gratitude decreed him a Crown of Gold  Aeschines  being jealous of his Rival's Glory brought an Action against  Ctesiphon  as being the Author of the Decree and founded it upon a Pretence that  Demosthenes  had not pass'd his Accounts to the Publick and therefore was not capable by Law of receiving any Reward for his Services This  Fact happen'd in the hundred and tenth  Olympaid  about the Time of the Battle of  Cheron√™a  and the Suit was commenc'd soon after but it was not heard till several Years after  Philip  's Death when  Aeschines  taking Advantage of  De  mosthenes  whose Credit was then at a very low Ebb brought it on However  Demosthenes  prevail'd as well by the Justice of his Cause as by the Force of his Eloquence and  Aeschines  was so asham'd that he spent the Remainder of his Life in a voluntary Exile  Another famous Man  Character of Isocrates  who encourag'd the People in this peaceable Disposition and confirm'd them in their good Opinion of  Philip  was  Isocrates  who yet did it with an honest Intention He was a great Master of the Rules of Oratory and most of the great Men of his Time had been instructed by him But he declin'd speaking himself in publick having a weak Voice and a natural Diffidence and Timidity However he was not wholly unconcern'd in the Affairs of the Publick but his way of de  sivering his Sentiments upon them was in Wri  ting and in the Form of an Oration And in this manner he now address'd himself to  Philip  with whom he was upon some Terms of Friend  hip and Confidence but not otherwise than he thought consistent with the Duty of a good Ci  zen He explain'd to him the several Advan  ages that might be drawn from the Peace he  nd concluded with  Athens  His Advices to Philip  and told him that  in order to make a right use of it he should endeavour to compose the Differences still subsisting between the other States and to restore the general Tranquillity of  Greece  That the reconciling them to one another and then leaving them to the free Enjoyment of their Laws and their Liberty would endear him to them and would redound infinitely more to his Honour  than all the Conquests he could make He then advis'd him to turn his Arms against  Persia  as the proper Object of his Ambition intimating to him that the  Grecians  would readily act in Conjunction with him against their common and inveterate Enemy and that in that Case there would be no room to doubt of the Success For Proof whereof he instanc'd to him the Expedi+tion of  The Ten Thousand  with the glorious Cir+cumstances of their Retreat and that of  Ages  laus  afterwards who with a Body of  Spartan  only would have subdu'd the whole  Persia  Empire if he had not been diverted from it b  the Divisions of his Country He told him fur+ther that many who were prejudic'd against him  gave him the Character of an artful and desig  n+ing Prince and were of Opinion that whatever specious Pretences he made use of to disguise h  Approach towards them his real Intention w  to make himself Master of  Greece  He men+tion'd these things only as Reports and suc  as were injurious and without Foundation a  would not suffer himself to suppose that a Prin  who valu'd himself so much upon his being descended from  Hercules  the Deliverer of  Greece  would ever make an Attempt to enslave it However he exhorted him by a generous and disinterested Proceeding to contradict these Reports to govern his Subjects with Justice and Prudence and to give Peace to his Neighbours in short to set Bounds to his Ambition at home and to extend his Conquests in  Persia  The main Scope of this Oration was to divert him from attempting any thing that might give Umbrage to  Greece  and  Isocrates  chose this way of gaining upon him by Mildness and Complaisance but he was too easy and credulous  Demosthenes  was more a Man of Business and knew the World and  Philip  too well to imagine that one of his aspiring and intriguing Temper who had during his whole Reign fomented Divisions in  Greece  in order to reap the Benefit of it to himself would be prevail'd upon by any Reasoning of this Kind to give up his favourite Design which he had so long projected and which was now so near taking Effect However the Sincerity and long Experience of  Isocrates  who was now eightyeight Years old added great Weight to his Opinion which with the Impressions that  Aeschines  and the other Pensioners had made upon the People together with their own natural Aversion to War determin'd the Point so far in favour of  Philip  that he was suffer'd  quietly to pursue his March into  Phocis  Philip suffer'd to gain the Streights of Thermopylae  and to gain the Streights of  Thermopylae  He did not immediately discover what use he intended to make of his Entrance into  Greece  but went on according to his Agreement with the  Thebans  A M Olymp He puts an End to the Phocian War  to put an End to the  Phocian  War which he easily effected His Name and Appearance struck such a Terror among the  Phocians  that tho' they had lately receiv'd a Reinforcement of a thousand heavyarm'd  Spartans  under the Command of their King  Archidamus  they declin'd giving him Battle and sent to treat with him or rather to submit themselves to any Terms that he would give them He allow'd  Phalecus  to retire with eight thousand Men being Mercenaries into  Peloponnesus  but the rest who were the Inhabitants of  Phocis  were left at his Mercy As the disposing of them was a Matter wherein  Greece  in general was concern'd he did not think fit to act in it by his own private Authority but referr'd it to the  Amphictyons  whom he caus'd to be assembled for that Purpose But they were so much under his Influence that they serv'd only to give a Sanction to his Determinations They decreed  That all the Cities of  Phocis  should be demolish'd That they who had fled as being principally concern'd in the Sacrilege should be stigmatiz'd as accurs'd and proscrib'd a Outlaws That they who remain'd as Inhabitants should be dispers'd in Villages and oblig'd to pay  out of their Lands a yearly Tribute of sixty Talents till the Whole of what had been taken out of the Temple should be restor'd  They were likewise adjudg'd to lose their Seat in the Council of the  Amphictyons  wherein they had a double Voice This  Philip  got transferr'd to himself  He obtains a Seat among the Amphictyons  which was a very material Point and may be look'd upon as the principal Step towards his gaining that Authority which he afterwards exercis'd in the Affairs of  Greece  At the same time he gain'd in Conjunction with the  Thebans  and  Thessalians  and the Superintendency of the Pythian Games  the Superintendency of the  Pythian  Games which the  Corinthians  had forfeited for their having taken Part with the  Phocians  Thus did  Philip  without striking a Stroke put an End to this War after it had for ten Years together divided  Greece  against itself And besides the other Advantages that he had drawn from it he gain'd an universal Esteem and Applause for having vindicated the Honour of Religion  Diodorus Siculus  who generally abounds with Sentiments of Piety towards the Gods but with a great Mixture of Credulity and Superstition ascribes all the Success of his Affairs afterwards to this single Instance of his Zeal for Religion which in reality was nothing but Artifice and Hypocrisy He goes on to describe the several Judgments which befel those who were concern'd in the Sacrilege and descends even to their Wives who he says were made Examples of the Divine Vengeance for  having adorn'd themselves with Necklaces and o  ther Trinkets taken out of the Temple H  carries his Reflexions so far as to impute th  Loss of the Power and Liberty of the principa  Cities of  Greece  which happen'd afterwards un  der  Antipater  to their being engag'd in this Ac  of Profanation with the  Phocians  CHAP III  From the End of the Phocian War to the Battle of Cheron√™a Containing the Space of Years  PHILIP  having by these plausible Methods succeeded in this Expedition did not think it adviseable by attempting any thing further at present to fully the Glory he had acquir'd by it or to incense the Body of the  Grecians  against him Wherefore he return'd in a triumphan  manner to his own Dominions where we will leave him employ'd against his old Enemies the  Illyrians  to relate some remarkable Occurrence  which happen'd at this time in  Sicily  Affairs in Sicily  For tho  that Island be not strictly to be look'd upon as  Part of  Greece  yet the Tranfactions we are now speaking of as they were owing chiefly to th  Grecians  will naturally fall in with their Story And here it may be necessary to take a summary  View of the State of that Island  The first Inhabitants  without entering into the fabulous Accounts of the first Ages of it For  Sicily  like most other Nations had its Giants and Monsters Such were the  Cyclopes  and  Laestrigones  who are mention'd as the first Inhabitants To them succeeded the  Sicani  but whether they were Natives or transplanted from  Spain  is not clearly determin'd The next were the  Siculi  who being drove by the  Pelasgi  from that Part of  Latium  whereon  Rome  was built and finding no proper Seat on the Continent transported themselves as Adventurers to this Island where they became so far Masters as to give the Name to it which it has ever since retain'd  About three hundred Years after they were in Possession of the Island a considerable Number of  Grecians  settled themselves in it  The Grecians get footing three  These were the  Chalcidians  of  Euboea  and they were soon followed by a Body of  Corinthians  who possess'd themselves of  Syracuse  which from the Extent of its Buildings and the Conveniency and Capatiousness of the Harbour became the  Metropolis  of the Island tho' it was rivall'd by several other great Cities which were independent of That and of one another These Cities were originally govern'd by the People but as the Power of the leading Men among them encreas'd they fell by Degrees into  Aristocracies  and were afterwards erected into little Principalities and Tyrannies under the Command of single Persons  And it frequently happen'd that some one of these Tyrants of a more enterprising Genius than the rest aspir'd to the Conquest of the Whole  Such was the confus'd State of  Sicily  for several Ages before and after the  Grecians  had any footing in it  Summary Account of Syracuse  and the  Syracusians  underwent the same Changes and Interruptions in the Course of its Government as the other Parts of the Island Their first Tyrant was  Gelon  Gelon the first Tyrant  who taking Advantage of the Dissensions between the Magistrates and the People fell in with the former and under a Pretence of restoring them to their Dignities obtain'd the Sovereignty for himself However he made no ill use of his Power He signaliz'd himself by many great Actions both in Peace and War He not only strengthen'd and adorn'd the City and enlarg'd the Territory but sav'd the whole Island from falling into the Hands of the  Carthaginians  who had set their Heart upon the Conquest of it as lying so convenient for their Shipping and were further tempted by the Fruitfulness of the Soil and the Riches of the Inhabitants Accordingly under the common Pretence of assisting to compose the Differences among them they threw a vast Number of their own and other  African  Troops into the Island But their Designs were seen thro' and the several Cities uniting in their common Defence the  Carthaginians  were attack'd and defeated and are said to have lost an hundred  and fifty thousand Men in this Expedition The Honour of this Victory was ascrib'd chiefly to  Gelon  who had by this and many other Instances so far endear'd himself to the People that they suffer'd his Brothers  Hiero  and  Thrasybulus  to succeed him in their turns as lawful Princes  Is succeeded by his Brothers Hiero and Thrasy bulus  The former held it eleven Years and the latter ten Months But their Government became so odious to the People that they forc'd them to quit it and by this Means they recover'd their former Liberty which they enjoy'd near sixty Years  Another Usurpation by Dionysius the elder  till the elder  Dionysius  by his Bravery and Cunning usurp'd again upon them and supported himself for thirtyeight Years notwithstanding his many Acts of Violence and Cruelty  His Character  But he had some Qualities which were vere very useful to the Publick He greatly increas'd the Naval Force and was very zealous in prosecuting the War against the  Carthaginians  He had studied the Art of Speaking and found his account in it especially at his first setting out upon the foot of a Patriot But that which he chiefly apply'd himself to was Poetry which he affected to a Degree that made him ridiculous He was so full of his Performances of this kind that he not only courted Applause but extorted it by Rewards and Punishments In short he valu'd himself more upon his writing bad Verses than upon his gaining a Victory against the Enemies of his Country  He was succeeded by one of his Sons of the same Name  He is succeeded by his Son Dionysius  who inherited his Father's Vices but without his Spirit or Capacity However being of a milder Temper his Friends had Hope  of reclaiming him and of correcting those Failings in him which they look'd upon only as the Effects of a bad Education They who were principally employ'd in this Work  The Character of Dion  were  Dio  and  Plato  The former was his Brotherinlaw  and was so remarkable for his Honour and Virtue and Zeal for his Country that he was not only the greatest Man in  Sicily  but might be rank'd with the best Men in the best Age of  Greece  But he had a Rigidness and Austerity of the  Spartan  kind which was not very well suite  to the Task he had undertaken However be  ing associated with  Plato  who had a more en  gaging manner they us'd their joint Endeavour to give the young Prince a Tincture of Science and Literature and to instill into him Principle of Justice and Moderation and they had i  some measure succeeded in their Design B  his Flatterers and his own natural Disposition g  the better of all their Instructions and he soo  relaps'd into his former State of Indolence an  Sensuality The Consequence was that  Di  was disgrac'd and banish'd  who drives Dionysius into Italy  But he return'd ar  drove the Tyrant into  Italy  and by this Means p  the  Syracusians  into a Condition of reestablising themselves in their Freedom But instead improving this Opportunity they quarrelled wi  their Deliverer and upon an illgrounded Jealousy of his aspiring to the Government treated him with great Inhumanity and Ingratitude which he generously overlook'd and endeavour'd still to extricate them out of their Difficulties But he was soon after kill'd by means of  Calippus  an  Athenian  Dion  is killed by Calippus  who came over with him to assist him against  Dionysius  who succeeds in the Tyranny  but began now to set up for himself and by getting rid of  Dion  who was the chief Obstacle in his way succeeded in the Tyranny and held it about a Year  Dionysius  after ten Years Absence  Dionysius is restored  found Means to reinstate himself in the Government but he did not hold it long For his Sufferings instead of making him wiser and better had harden'd and exasperated him and he became more fierce and cruel than before Hereupon the People had Recourse to  Icetes  who was a Native of  Syracuse  but at that time govern'd the  Leontines  He readily espous'd their Quarrel against the Tyrant but it was in order to succeed him and with that View he enter'd into a secret League with the  Carthaginians  who lay hovering about the Island with a numerous Fleet This gave the  Syracusians  a fresh Alarm so that between their Oppressions and Divisions at home and their Appehensions of an Invasion from abroad they knew not who to apply to nor who to trust and they had brought themselves into these Streights by their own ill Conduct For they did not distinguish between their Friends  and their Foes they had all the Capriciousness and Insolence of a Free State without the Power in short they knew neither how to govern nor to obey  In this distracted State of their Affairs they turn'd their Thoughts towards  Greece  and applied for Relief to  Corinth  as being their MotherCountry and a common Patroness of Liberty The  Corinthians  sent them a favourable Answer and order'd a Body of Troops to be dispatch'd to them under the Command of  Timoleon  Timoleon  ordered to the Relief of the  Syracusians  who was of one of the best Families in  Corinth  and who besides his many other great Qualities had given a very extraordinary Instance of his Aversion to Tyranny  He had an Elder Brother named  Timophanes  Account of his former Conduct  whom he lov'd passionately and had rescued him in an Engagement against the  Argives  with the utmost Hazard of his own Life This Brother having afterwards the Command of the CityGuards made use of them to subvert the Government and declared himself King of  Corinth Timoleon  endeavour'd by all possible means to dissuade him from these violen  Measures and not being able of himself to bring him to Reason engag'd two of his Friends to assist him in it Upon their expostulating wit  him he first laugh'd at them and then a  they press'd him further he grew angry up  on which  Timoleon  finding that neither the Prayers and Entreaties nor their Arguments an  Menaces had any effect upon him retired at a little distance from him and stood weeping with his Face cover'd whilst the other Two drew their Swords and dispatch'd him  Diodorus Siculus  says  Timoleon  kill'd him with his own Hands in the Marketplace He relates this Story with several other different Circumstances But the Account which  Plutarch  gives of it from the Historians who liv'd at the time when the Fact was committed is more probable and more consistent and uniform as well as more to the Honour of  Timoleon  This Action was by some extoll'd and applauded as the highest pitch of human Virtue and by others condemn'd as a base and unnatural Parricide And  Timoleon  himself when he came to cool felt such a Remorse for it that he abandon'd himself to Despair and resolv'd to starve himself to death His Friends with great Importunity and even by Force prevail'd upon him to take some Sustenance and at length he promis'd them he would live but upon condition that he might quit the Service of the Publick and retire to some remote and desart Corner of the Country which he accordingly did and for near twelve Years together wander'd up and down the Fields by himself in this anxious and sorlorn Condition  He was return'd to  Corinth  when he was pitch'd upon for this Command and as he liv'd still in a retir'd way he would gladly have  declin'd it but that he did not think it consistent with the Duty he ow'd to his Country Before he set out he was told  That as to the Affair of his Brother the World would judge of it according to his Behaviour in this Expedition That if he acquitted himself well in it he would be said to have freed his Country from a Tyrant if otherwise he would be look'd upon as his Brother's Murtherer  Whilst he was preparing to embark there came Letters from  Icetes  to dissuade him from it  Icetes endeavours to prevent his landing in Sicily  as a dangerous and fruitless Attempt for that he would be intercepted in his Passage by the  Carthaginians  whom for want of receiving Succours in due time from  Corinth  he had been forced to call in to his Assistance against the Tyrant Whereupon  Timoleon  was forthwith order'd away with ten Gallies  Being arriv'd on the Coast of  Italy  Olymp He arrives on the Coast of  Italy    he receiv'd advice that  Icetes  had made himself Master of the greatest Part of  Syracuse  that he had forced the Tyrant into the Citadel and that the  Carthaginians  had orders to prevent his landing And accordingly at  Rhegium  he found twenty Gallies which had been detach'd from their Fleet for that purpose They had likewise Deputies on board from  Icetes  to acquaint him That the Affairs of  Sicily  being in a manner settled there would be no Occasion for his Assistance but however that in case he would send home his  Gallies with the Troops he might come up himself to  Syracuse  and share with him in his Conquests  Timoleon  had no Views of this kind but finding himself overpower'd he seem'd to hearken to their Proposal and to submit to it as a Case of Necessity  He lands in  Sicily  by a Stratagem  However he desir'd for Form sake and in order to justify his Conduct at his Return to  Corinth  that what had pass'd privately between them might be declared in a more open manner before the People of  Rhegium  as being common Friends to both Parties But the leading Men among them were in his Interest and this Demand of his was a concerted thing between them as a Project for his escaping out of their Hands To carry on this Design an Assembly was call'd and  Timoleon  and the Ambassadors together with the Captains of the  Carthaginian  Gallies were admitted to it But the People instead of entering upon the Business for which they were conven'd fell into tedious and trifling Debates about other Matters and spun out the Time 'till nine of the  Corinthian  Gallies got clear of the Harbour and put to Sea which  Timoleon  having secret notice of found means to slip unobserv'd through the Croud and having got on board the remaining Gally join'd the rest of his Squadron and he landed at  Tauromenium  in  Sicily  where  Andromachus  the Governor receiv'd him with open Arms and  with him in his Design of freeing the  Island But few of the other Towns as yet came in to him They had a general Distrust of all Foreign Commanders having found by Experience that they had been allured by them with fair Promises and afterwards been more oppress'd by them than by those from whom they pretended to deliver them The  Syracusians  had a better Opinion of him at least they had no body else to depend on And yet they had very little Hopes of Relief from him whilst  Icetes  was in possession of the Town  Dionysius  of the Citadel and the  Carthaginians  of the Harbour  His first Scene of Action was at  Adranum  a small City below Mount  Aetna  His Success at  Adranum  where the Inhabitants being divided one Party call'd in  Timoleon  to their Assistance and the other  Icetes  The former was glad to take this Opportunity of advancing further into the Country and the latter thought it so necessary to prevent him that he immediately march'd thither with a Detachment of five thousand Men  Timoleon  arriv'd there at the same time with his whole Strength which amounted to no more than twelve Hundred However taking advantage of the Enemy whilst they were fixing their Tents he fell upon them with great Fury and put them to flight having kill'd three hundred of them and taken double that Number of Prisoners together with their Camp and all their Baggage  This prosperous Beginning gave him great Credit  Olym  Other Places submit to him  and increas'd his Followers so that not only  Adranum  but most of the other neighbouring Towns submitted to him  Mamercus  Tyrant of  Catana  a Man of great Wealth and Power enter'd into Alliance with him and the City of  Messina  at the same time declared for him It likewise advanc'd his Affairs at  Syracuse  where  Dionysius  finding his Case desperate  Dionysius  surrenders himself  chose rather to give up himself and the Citadel to him as a Man of Honour and Bravery than to become a Prey to  Icetes  whom he despis'd for his Behaviour in the late Action Accordingly  Timoleon  sent four hundred Men to take possession of the Citadel and they gain'd their Entrance by Stealth and in small Companies They found there two thousand Soldiers whom  Dionysius  likewise gave up to them together with a vast Magazine of Stores and Arms for seventy thousand Men  As to  Dionysius  himself he was conducted out privately  Olymp  and is sent to  Corinth  and carried to  Timoleon  's Camp from whence he was transported to  Corinth  where he became a publick Spectacle People flock'd from all Parts to see the Man who had made so much Noise in  Sicily  and whose Name was become formidable even to  Greece  But he appear'd very easy and composed and without any Marks either of Terror or of Dignity Instead of endeavouring to retrieve his Affairs he fell into a mean way of Life  sauntering about in the Shops and the Shambles drinking in Taverns or squabbling with lewd Women in the Streets And at length being reduced to great Necessity he is said to have taught School for Bread  Timoleon  having met with such Success  Timoleon's further Successes  Icetes  was so terrify'd that he had sent for a further Supply of Forces from  Africa  and  Magon  the  Carthaginian  came over to him with an hundred and fifty Sail of Ships and sixty thousand Men Whereupon he block'd up the Citadel and march'd in order to besiege  Catana  likewise where  Timoleon  then lay But before he had made any Progress there he receiv'd advice that  Leon  a  Corinthian  who commanded in the Citadel at  Syracuse  had made a successful Sally that he had kill'd one part of the Besiegers and put the rest to flight and that having taken  Acradina  the strongest Quarter of the Town he had added Works to secure it and to join it to the Citadel  lcetes  immediately return'd to  Syracuse  and  Timoleon  having lately receiv'd a Supply of two thousand Foot and two hundred Horse from  Corinth  soon follow'd him  However he had as yet no more than four thousand Men to oppose to a numerous Army But there happen'd a lucky Incident which gave him great Encouragement Whilst he lay before the Town some of his  Corinthians  falling into company with a Party of Mercenaries  who serv'd under  Icetes  took occasion to expostulate with them upon their present Alliance with the  Carthaginians  They told them That as they were of the same  Grecian  Extraction with themselves they ought to be engaged in the same Interest and reproach'd them with endeavouring to put  Syracuse  and all Secily into the Hands of those who were not only  Barbarians  but the vilest and most inhuman Sort of them and such as they ought to  nite against as their common Enemy The Rumour of this Discourse was soon spread about the Camp and it had such an Effect upon  Magon  that for fear of being betray'd and sacificed he forthwith embark'd his Troops  The  Carthaginians  quit  Sicily  and was gone so suddenly that  Timoleon  's Men in a way of Pleasantry caus'd Proclamation to be made offering a Reward to any who should bring Tidings of the  Carthaginian  Fleet  Magon  at  is Return home being conscious of his Mis  ehaviour kill'd himself and the People were  o incens'd at him that they nail'd his Body upon a Cross  Timoleon  to improve this Advantage  Timoleon  attacks  Syracuse  made his Disposition for attacking the Town in three several Parts of it which he accordingly did the next Day and with such Vigour and Success that  Icetes  's Troops giving way  and gains it  he carried  t at the first Assault and  Plutarch  says there was not one  Corinthian  either kill'd or wounded  it The first thing he did upon this Victory  was to summon in the Inhabitants to demolist the Citadel  Demolisheth the Citadel  which he call'd  The Nest of Tyrants  They soon levell'd it with the Ground and from thence proceeded to pull down the Palace of their Usurpers to tear up their Tombs and to destroy every thing that might preserve an  Memorial of them In the Place where the Ci  tadel stood  Timoleon  order'd Courts of Justic  to be erected But whilst he was thus endea  vouring to give free Scope to the Laws and t  put the Government upon the ancient footing he found there were very few Inhabitants left t  enjoy the Benefit of it For what with the Divisions among themselves their Wars with th  Carthaginians  and the Oppression of their Go  vernors such Numbers of them had been de  story'd and forc'd away that the City was in manner become a Desart and the Grass grew i  the Streets And this was the Case of most  the great Towns in  Sicily  But as to  Syracus  the  Corinthians  at the Instance of  Timoleon  an  those few who remain'd there repeopled i  They sent to all the publick Assemblies of  Greec  and into  Asia  repeoples the City  and the Islands to notify Th  Syracuse  having recover'd its Liberty all suc  as were willing to go and settle there should  transported thither and should have the Lan  equally divided among them By this Enco  ragement they got together a Body of ten tho  sand which with those who had fled and we banish'd and others who flock'd in from  Parts to  Timoleon  amounted in the whole to sixty thousand This generous Proceeding of the  Corinthians  is taken particular notice of that when they had it in their Power to make themselves intire Masters of  Syracuse  they contented themselves with the Glory of saving and replenishing it and of being a second time the Founders of it  Timoleon  having thus far reestablish'd the Affairs of  Syracuse  Olymp  He proceeds to free the rest of the Island  march'd to the other Parts of the Island to free them likewise At  Leontium  be oblig'd  Icetes  to renounce his League with the  Carthaginians  and to demolish his Forts and then reduc'd him to the Condition of a private Man And  Leptines  of  Appollonia  surrendering himself up to him he spared his Life but sent him after  Dionysius  to  Corinth  But before he could root out all the Remains of arbitrary Government the  Carthaginians  to secure those Places which were still in their Interest  Is opposed again by the  Carthaginians  and to retrieve the Disgrace of their last Expedition sent an Army of seventy thousand Men with a Fleet of two hundred Sail besides  thousand Transport Ships laden with Chariots Engines of Battery and all kinds of Provisions These Forces landed at the Promontory of  Lily  aeum  under the Command of  Asdrubal  and  Hamilcar  and occasion'd such a general Consternation that  Timoleon  could raise but twelve thousand Men to make head against them  Plutarch  reduces them to seven thousand and says that  even of that Number one thousand deserted him in their March  However he went on to give the enemy Battle before they had got a thorough footing in th  Island and coming up with them in their Pa  sage over the River call'd  Crimesus  Olymp  The Battle at the River  Crimesus  he order'd his Horse to break into their Ranks before they were well form'd But they were so expos'd to the Chariots which were plac'd in the Front tha  Timoleon  drew them off and taking a side Compass with his whole Strength attack'd the Enemy in the Flank After the first Onset ther  happen'd a sudden Storm of Thunder and Lightning Wind Rain and Hail which drove full i  the Face of the  Carthaginians  and beat so furiously upon them that they could neither se  nor hear nor stand in their Ranks And  Timoleon  's Troops pouring in upon them whilst they were thus disorder'd made a great Slaughter among them and put the main Body to flight Some who had gain'd the Plain were overtaken and put to the Sword Great Numbers wer  cut to pieces as they were climbing the Hills They who made back to the River  ell in among others who were coming over to them and wer  promiscuously carried with them down the Current And others were plung'd into little Torrents and Rivulets which were occasion'd by th  Violence of the Storm and the overflowing o  the River where they roll'd about in the Mire  and were so encumber'd with their heavy Armour that they were not able to disengage themselves or to make any Defence In this manner their whole Army was distress'd on all Sides and every thing conspir'd to make it an entire Defeat  Timoleon  gains the Victory  There is some Variation in the Accounts that are given of this Action but not in the most material Circumstances of it There is likewise some Difference as to the Number of those who were kill'd and taken According to the highest Accounts of them there were above ten thousand slain besides three thousand who were Natives of  Carthage  of the best Families and Fortunes and of the most approv'd Valour They were look'd upon in the same Light as the  Sacred Band  of  Pelopidas  and went under the same Appellation There were also above fifteen thousand taken Prisoners together with the Camp and Baggage and a great Quantity of Gold and Silver Plate and other rich Booty  Timoleon  upon this Victory return'd to  Syra  use  But whilst he was endeavouring to perfect his Scheme of Government there  Further Attempts to restore the Tyranny  the Seeds of Tyranny which had not been thoroughly rooted out in the other Parts of the Island began to shoot up again The Cities of  Catana  and  Mess  a  with their Tyrants  Mamercus  and  Hippo  had revolted from him and  Icetes  tho' he had been sufficiently humbled took this Occasion to join with them and they invited the  Carthaginians  to come and make another Effort Accordingly  seventy Sail of Ships were dispatch'd under the Command of  Gisco  who likewise debauch'd some of the  Grecians  into his Service But this Expedition had no better Success than the former and serv'd only to hasten the putting an End to these Wars  but defeated by  Timoleon  For  Icetes Mamercus  and  Hippo  appearing again in Arms upon this Reinforcement  Timoleon  pursu'd them one after another and after he had kill'd several thousands of their Followers they were all three taken and executed The Wives and Children of  Icetes  were likewise condemn'd and executed by the  Syracusians  which was look'd upon as an ungenerous Part in  Timoleon  that he did not interpose in their Behalf But it was the Act of the People and was said to be done by way of Retaliation for the like Treatment of the Family of  Dion  whose Wife and Sister and Infant Son  Icetes  had caus'd to be thrown alive into the Sea  During these Transactions of  Timoleon  the  Carthaginians  sued to him for Peace and agreed among other Conditions to renounce all Leagues and Associations with any of the  Sicilian  Tyrants which he consider'd as the most effectual Means of suppressing them and it succeeded accordingly  Olymp  The publick Liberty restored  For soon after this Treaty they were utterly destroy'd and the publick Liberty was restor'd  Timoleon  having finish'd this great Work divested himself of his Authority and chose rather  to live as a private Man at  Syracuse  Timoleon  retires and lives private in  Syracuse  with the Pleasure of seeing so many thousands made happy in the Enjoyment of the Blessings he had procur'd for them than to grasp at any further Power in  Sicily  or to return in Triumph to  Greece  He was infinitely belov'd and honour'd by the  Syracusians  who in Memory of what he had done for them made a Decree  That in all their future Wars they should have a  Corinthian  Commander  And so long as  Timoleon  liv'd they made no Law or Treaty nor did any extraordinary Act of Government wherein he was not consulted As to what remains to be said concerning him it will fall in more properly with the Account of his Death which happen'd two Years later  During the former Part of these Commotions in  Sicily Philip  was gaining Ground upon the  Illyrians  and settling his Conquests at home But before the reestablishment of Affairs in that Island he had carried his Arms into  Thrace  and the  Hellespont  among the  Athenian  Colonies and Confederates and thereby given occasion to fresh Disturbances which should have been related in their due Order of Time but I have chose rather to do it now by way of Retrospect than to break into the Narration of what pass'd at  Syracuse  In the first Year of the th  Olympiad  he march'd into  Thessaly  and having clear'd out the Remains of Tyranny in the several Cities there he not only confirm'd the  Thessalians  in  his Interest but gain'd over many of their Neighbours  Having strengthen'd himself in these Parts he went the next Year into  Thrace  where he had form'd a Design against the  Chersonese  Philip  's Design against the  Chersonese  of  Thrace  This Peninsula had with some little Interruption been for many Years in the Hands of the  Athenians  But  Cotys  as being King of the Country had lately wrested it from them and left it in Succession to his Son  Chersobleptes  He not being able to defend himself against  Philip  gave it back to the  Athenians  reserving to himself only  Cardia  the capital City But  Philip  having soon after routed him of the rest of his Dominions the  Cardians  for fear of falling again under the Power of the  Athenians  threw themselves into his Protection  He is opposed by D    pithes  Diopithes  who was the Chief of the  Athenian  Colony lately sent to the  Chersonese  consider'd this Proceeding of  Philip  in supporting the  Cardians  as an Act of Hostility against  Athens  Whereupon he invaded the Maritime Part of  Thrace  and carried away a great deal of Botty  Philip  being at this time in the upper Part of the Country was not in a Condition to do himself Justice But he wrote to complain of it at  Athens  as an Infraction of the Peace and his Creatures there were not wanting on their Part to aggravate the Charge against  Diopithes  as having acted without Orders    and taken it upon himself to renew the War They likewise accus'd him o  committing Acts of Pyracy and of laying their  Allies under Contribution But whatever Grounds there were for this Part of the Accusation the Government of  Athens  was principally to blame in it For having no proper Fund for the War they sent out their Generals without Mony or Provisions and left them to shift for themselves and yet made them answerable for any Miscarriages that should happen for want of their being better supply'd This was a great Discouragement to the Service and put those who were employ'd in it upon pillaging and plundering in such a manner as they would otherwise have been asham'd of  Demosthenes  in an Harangue that he made upon the State of the  Chersonese  undertook the Defence of  Diopithes  Demosthenes defends him  And altho' that might be the principal Design of his Speech yet he enter'd into a great Variety of other Matter and laid open so much of the present Situation of Affairs both in  Athens  and several other States of  Greece  that it may be proper to give the Reader a short Account of it and the rather because it contains the Substance of what  Demosthenes  has said in some of his other Orations in the same manner and almost in the same Terms against  Philip  and his Partizans in the  Athenian  Assembly  He urg'd to the People in Behalf of  Diopithes  that he had done nothing but what his Necessities had forc'd him to and that he had only follow'd the Example of his Predecessors who had constantly laid the Islanders and other  Asiatick  Allies under Contribution and that they who paid it found their Account in it in having Convoys to secure them from Pyrates and otherwise to protect their Trade That instead of being question'd for using his Industry to procure that Subsistence for the Troops which he could not obtain from the Government they ought forthwith to send him a Reinforcement and to provide better for their Pay However he told them That whatever Exactions or Violences he had been guilty of he was their Officer and it was always in their Power to send for him home and to punish him as they found he deserv'd But he told them at the same time that this Accusation was made use of only as an Handle to divert them from inquiring into the Motions and Designs of  Philip  and inveighs against  Philip  who with a powerful Army in  Thrace  and upon the  Hellespont  was ravaging their Possessions debauching their Allies and stirring up against them both the  Grecians  and  Barbarians  That whilst he was engag'd in these Practices he was to be look'd upon as the first Aggressor and that they were not to think themselves secure because he was not come up to the  Piraeus  nor was attacking them in  Attica  Among other Arguments to induce them to make head against him he told them they had more to apprehend from him than their Neighbours had and he explain'd it to them by an artful Piece of Flattery  You must not imagine  said  he  that  Philip  will treat you in the same manner with the rest of the  Grecians  and that he will content himself with barely making Slaves of you No his Design is to destroy and extirpate you For he is sensible that a People who have so long known what it is to command will never bear Servitude and that you are incapable of doing it if you would He knows that you would be always struggling to break your Chains and that you would give him more Disturbance than all the rest of the World And therefore you may look upon it as an undoubted Maxim that he can intend nothing less than you total Ruin and Destruction  From thence he proceeded to inveigh against the Orators  and the Orators  for the treacherous Part they had acted upon these Proceedings of  Philip  and he did it with great Boldness and Acrimony by exposing their false Reasoning their false Zeal and their false Courage He told the People it was in vain to think of their being victorious abroad so long as they nourish'd in their Bosom these Pensioners and Creatures of their Enemy these domestick Foes who were as so many hidden Rocks and Shelves upon which they must one Day unavoidably suffer Shipwreck He went on to shew them that the insolent Behaviour of  Philip  towards them was wholly owing to these Haranguers who sav'd him the trouble of managing and undermining them as he did the other States with an Appearance at least of bearing them Goodwill and doing them good  Offices He instanc'd in the  Thessalians  tha tho' he had brought them under Subjection h  had taken some Pains to inveigle them into it and had strow'd the Way to it with Flowers by freeing them from their Tyrants and by re  storing them to their Seat among the  Amphictyons  That he had drawn the poor  Olynthians  into hi  Snare by heaping his Favours upon them and had lull'd them asleep by his Cession of  Potidae  to them That he had at present got the  Thebans  under his Dependence but that he had thought it proper to gild their Chains by putting them in the Possession of  B  eotia  by laying waste the Country of their Enemies the  Phocians  and by delivering them from a long and burthensome War  But why  says Demosthenes  does he not think it worth his while to amuse you with some such Marks of his Complaisance and his Bounty Why does he not endeavour to gain upon you by some real or pretended Benefits On the contrary he infringes your Treaties breaks into your Alliances and seizes your Possessions and does it with an high Hand without so much as attempting to excuse or dissemble it  He tells them the Reason of this Difference in  Philip  's Conduct with regard to them was because he had no need of keeping any Measures with them or of saving Appearances For that he knew he had a Party among them who were always ready to plead his Cause and to justify all his Proceedings  Athens  says Demosthenes  is the only City of  Greece  where a Man may with Impunity display his Eloquence in Defence and even in Praise of the common Enemy  He expatiated further upon the base and ungenerous Artifices of the Orators in persecuting their FellowCitizens  They  said he  who have no real Concern for the Welfare of the Publick may with Ease and Safety censure arraign and condemn They can always secure themselves from Danger by their inexhaustible Fund of Flattery and Dissimulation by their daily shifting and changing their Opinion according to the different Taste and Humour of the People and by disguising and concealing from them the weak and disorderly State of their Affaris  The truly brave and zealous Citizen he describes in another manner  That the only thing he has in view is the Peoples Interest that in order to promote it he opposes their Inclinations combats their Opinion and makes no Concessions to them out of Complaisance that he delivers his Mind freely and openly according to the best of his Judgment and makes himself accountable to them not only for the Reasonableness of his Advice but likewise for the Success of it Demosthenes  does not directly apply this Character to himself but it may be easily collected from what follows that he thought it belong'd to him  I know  says he  FellowCitizens as well as others how to flatter to accuse to proscribe and to practise all those other little Arts of gaining Credit with  you but I have a Soul above it I have no Avarice nor Ambition my chief Aim is to repeat and inculcate those Truths which because they are distasteful to you must therefore give my Rivals the Preference in your Favour and yet they are such as if you would hearken to them would give you the advantage over your Enemies It is to me a Part unworthy of a good Citizen to study ways of rising on a sudden to the highest Rank of Men in  Athens  when you are at the same time sinking to the lowest Rank of Men in  Greece  When he had thus endeavour'd to open their Eyes and to free them from their Dependence on the other Orators he press'd them to proceed forthwith to Action  It is my part  says he  to propose it is yours to resolve and to execute  He concludes with exhorting them to supply the Necessities of the State to keep their Troops on foot and in good Discipline to dispatch Ambassadors to all Parts with Instructions to communicate their Resolutions and to give notice of the common Danger that threaten'd  Greece  and thereupon to negotiate and conclude whatever should be thought requisite for the Service of the Commonwealth And above all he advis'd them to shew no Mercy to those who prostituted themselves for Gain to the Enemy of their Country  Whatever effect these Remonstrances had for the present  Philip  was not discourag'd from  making further Attempts  Philip  takes advantage of the Divisions in  Peloponnesus  And he was furnish'd with a Pretence for it by the Divisions which were now in  Peloponnesus  and they were owing chiefly to the  Spartans  who having little to do in the late Foreign Transactions were recovering their Strengh at home and according to their usual Practice as they increas'd in Power made use of it to insult and oppress their Neighbours The  Argives  and  Messenians  being at this time persecuted by them put themselves under the Protection of  Philip  and the  Thebans  joining with them they all together form'd a powerful Confederacy The natural Balance against it was an Union between  Athens  and  Sparta  which the  Spartans  press'd with great Earnestness as the only means for their common Security and  Philip  and the  Thebans  did all in their Power to prevent it  Demosthenes  spirits up the  Athenians  against him  But  Demosthenes  exerting himself upon this Occasion rous'd up the  Athenians  and put them so far upon their Guard that without coming to an open Rupture with  Philip  they oblig'd him to desist  This Storm in  Peloponnesus  was no sooner blown over but another happen'd which fell more immediately upon the  Athenians  and that was an Attempt upon  Euboea  Philip's  Attempt upon  Euboea  Philip  had long form'd a Design against this Island as being not only a rich Acquisition but an easy Passage into the Continent of  Attica  and in order now to execute it he had gain'd some of  the principal Men who suffer'd him to throw in a Body of  Macedonians  by means whereof he demolish'd some Places and fortified others and erected several petty Tyrants who acted in his Name and under his Authority  Plutarchus  of  Eretria  or  Clitarchus  as he is otherwise call'd sent to let the  Athenians  know That the Island must be lost if it were not immediately reliev'd Whereupon they dispatch'd some few Troops thither under the Command of  Phocion  This  Plutarchus  upon their Arrival chang'd his Opinion and made head against them However  Phocion  was not discourag'd he gave him battle and routed him and having gain'd a signal Victory return'd home He was succeeded in the Command by one  Molossus  who was not equal to it and suffer'd himself to be taken Prisoner But it does not appear that  Philip  prosecuted this War to any further Advantage  The Island preserve'd by  Phocion  so that the Recovery of the Island may be ascrib'd to  Phocion  He had before this Action given several Proos of his Courage and Capacity  His Character  but he began now to distinguish himself as a General and to bear a principal Part in the Affairs of the Government As he had Talents very well suited to both these Capacities he did not approve the modern Practice of allotting the Civil Power to one Sett of Men and the Military to another but was for having them united in the same Persons as they formerly were in  Solon  Aristides  and  Pericles  He had studied Philosophy under  Plato  and  Xenorates  and in Oratory he was upon a level with the best Speakers of his time He was not so pompous and diffuse as they but was better heard than most of them His Manner was plain and concise strong and pointed full of Matter and good Sense and always to the purpose When he was one Day in the Assembly observ'd to be very pensive and his Friends ask'd him the Reason of it  I am considering  said he  how to contract what I have to say  And  Demosthenes  who had a secret Jealousy of him was wont to call him  The Pruningbook of his Periods  This Brevity and Simplicity in his Diction was of the  Spartan  kind and he had still more of the  Spartan  in his manner of Deportment He had such a settled Composure in his Countenance that he was never seen either to laugh or cry He was grave and austere even to Moroseness insomuch that they who were Strangers to him did not care to accost him But this Severity was more in his Appearance than in his Temper For he was naturally very easy and conversable humane and beneficent and a great Patron of the distress'd even of those who had most oppos'd him His Friends reproving him for pleading in behalf of an ill Man He told them  The Innocent had no need of an Advocate  In the Camp he went very thinly clad and generally barefoot and he lived  at home with his Family much in the same coarse hardy way There is upon this occasion a remarkable Saying of his Wife who was noted for her Virtue and good Housewifery and being visited by an  Ionian  Woman of Distinction who shew'd her all her Jewels Embroidery and other rich Ornaments  For my part  said she to her  My only Ornament is my good Man  Phocion  who has commanded the  Athenians  now these twenty Years  He was not so happy in his Son who being inclined to Luxury and Excess he sent him to  Sparta  to be put into a stricter way of Education and  Demades  repoarch'd him with it publickly as an Attempt to introduce the  Spartan  Manners and Discipline He certainly had a very bad Opinion of the Manners of his Country and would gladly have reform'd them but he could not do it otherwise than by his Example and that was of small Force against so general a Corruption However as to his own particular it gain'd him an Awe and Attention from those who would not imitate him It created such an Opinion of him that he was chosen General upon Forty five several Expeditions and always in his Absence For tho' he did not decline the Service when he was call'd to it he never put himself in the way of it He was so far from making a servile court to the People or soothing them in their Follies that he took all Occasions of thwarting and opposing them  and he would never give up a point which he thought necessary for the Good or Safety of the Publick The Oracle having upon a certain Occasion told the  Athenians  That there was one Man in the City of a different Opinion from the rest and Enquiry being made who this should be  I  said Phocion  am the Man I am pleas'd with nothing that the Common People say or do  Another time when he had deliver'd his Opinion to them and found that it was generally approved  I wish  said he turning to his Friend  That what I have propos'd be not wrong  He was so tenacious in what he thought most adviseable that he would rather suffer himself to be treated as a Coward than enter into a War which did not appear to him to be just and necessary There is an Instance of this kind when being press'd to engage the Enemy at a disadvantage  No  said he  You cannot at this time make me valiant nor I you wise  The truth is he was naturally inclin'd to Peace and consider'd War no otherwise than as the means of procuring it He endeavour'd by several private Negotiations to put an end to the War with the  Macedonians  and herein he seem'd to act the Part of a Mediator But the Moderation and Complaisance which he shew'd in this Correspondence with the Enemies of his Country created a Suspicion of his being too well affected to them and at last it cost him his Life He certainly was upon good Terms with  Philip Alexander  and  Antipater  who all successively esteem'd and caress'd him and would have loaded him with Presents but he could not be prevail'd upon to accept any Upon this occasion  Antipater  was wont to say  I have two Friends at  Athens Phocion  and  Demades  of whom the former will not suffer me to gratify him at all and the other is never to be satisfy'd Phocion  upon the whole was one of the wisest and best sort of Men that  Athens  ever bred But the Steadiness of his Virtue and the Singularity of his Manners would not let him drive on with the Current of the Times he liv'd in and  Plutarch  mentions it as his Misfortune  That he came to the Helm when the Publick Bottom was just upon sinking  When  Philip  found his Affairs advance slowly in  Euboea  he thought fit to retreat and march'd back to  Thrace  in order to distress the  Athenians  in those Parts from whence they receiv'd a great Part of their Provisions With this View in the last Year of the th  Olympiad  he laid Siege to  Perinthus  Philip  besieges  Perinthus  and firmly attach'd to the  Athenians  He invested it with an Army of thirty thousand Men and having rais'd his Works to a great heighth so as to command those of the Enemy he made his Assault with all kinds of battering Engines The Inhabitants were no less active and resolute on their Part so that when  Philip  had made a Breach in the Wall which he thought  sufficient to gain his Entrance into the Town he found they had run up another Wall within side by means whereof together with the natural Advantage of the Place which rose up gradually in the Form of a Theatre they made a vigorous Defence and held out till they were reliev'd from  Byzantium  Philip  to cut off this Communication divided his Army and march'd with one half of it to form the Siege of  Byzantium  leaving the other to carry on that of  Perinthus  and  Byzantium  These violent Proceedings gave a general Alarm both in  Greece  and  Persia  The Lieutenants of the Provinces near the Coasts were order'd to assist the Besieg'd with what Forces they could spare The Islands of  Chios Cos  and  Rhodes  united in the same Design and the  Athenians  began now to exert themselves in earnest  Demosthenes  had before endeavour'd to awaken them out of their Lethargy and to convince them that the first Attack against  Perinthus  was an open Violation of the Peace And they so far gave Attention to him that  Chares  was sent out with a Fleet But he was a bad Man and of a mean Capacity and as such he was pitch'd upon by the Creatures of  Philip  for this Service He behav'd according to their Expectations and had so little Credit with the Allies of  Athens  upon the  Hellespont  that they did not care to admit him into their Ports But the People now being grown more sensible of their Danger thought it necessary to  appoint some other Commander on whom they could better depend and accordingly  Phocion  was order'd out with a fresh Supply of Forces  Philip  had hitherto endeavour'd by many specious Pretences to cover his Designs and to keep Measures with the  Athenians  But when he found they had taken the Alarm and were arming so many others against him he wrote them an expostulatory Letter  He endeavours to justify his Proceedings  wherein he charg'd them with the Infraction of their Treaties and with many other Injuries which he pretended to have receiv'd from them It was full of Complaints Reproaches and Menaces and was drawn in a very masterly manner with so much Art and Delicacy with such a Variety of Facts and such plausible Reasoning upon them and with such a Spirit of Majesty throughout the Whole that it may be look'd upon as one of the finest Pieces of Antiquity It was calculated for the Use of the Partizans at  Athens  so as to furnish them with Materials for pleading his Cause in the Assembly and the Intent of it was to try if it were yet too late to divert the People from pushing things to an Extremity The Point that he laid the greatest Stress upon was the engaging the  Persians  against him and this he imputed to the  Athenians  It does not clearly appear how far they were concern'd in it But it is certain that in order to check the Growth of his Power  Demosthenes  had prepar'd the People for an Alliance with  Persia  and still press'd it and  Pausanias  says that the  Persian  Troops which were employ'd on this occasion were commanded by  Apollodorus  an  Athenian  From such Circumstances as these  Philip  thought himself sufficiently warranted to remonstrate in the manner he did to the  Athenians  He told them  That by this Instance of their calling in the  Persians  and that at a time when he was in peace with them they had shewn more Hatred and Rancour against him than in cases of the most open and declared Enmity between them That they had acted in it contrary to all the Rules of Prudence and Policy and to the constant Practice not only of their Ancestors but of themselves likewise  And to this purpose he reminded them that they had some time since pass'd a formal Resolution to invite him to act in conjunction with them and the other  Grecians  against the  Persians  as  Barbarians  and as their common Enemy His applying these Appellations of  Barbarians  and Foreigners to the  Persians  was an artful way of disclaiming them with regard to himself and of blending together the Interests of  Greece  and  Macedonia  as if they were inseparable  Demosthenes  to prevent the Impressions this Letter might make upon the People  Demosthenes  refutes him  endeavour'd by way of Answer to expose the Fallacy of the Arguments contain'd in it They were founded wholly upon a Presumption that the  Athenians  were the Aggressors But it was notorious that  Philip  was taking their Places intercepting  their Provisions attacking their Allies and making every Day fresh Incroachments upon them and that in a time of profound Peace  as he calls it and before any Measures had been taken by the  Athenians  to oppose him This was the Truth of the Case and tha  which  Demosthenes  thought it more necessary to convince the People of than to go about to justify or to refute the Facts they wer  charg'd with He told them  The Lette  was wrote in a stile not suitable to th  People of  Athens  That it was a plain De  claration of War against them That  Philip  ha  long since made the same Declaration by his Ac  tions and that by the Peace he had conclude  with them he meant nothing further than a bar Cessation of Arms in order to gain time and t  take them more unprepared  From thence h  proceeded to his usual Topick of reproving them for their Sloth and for suffering them selves to be deluded by their Orators who wer  in  Philip  's Pay At the same time he advis'  them to change their Generals for that the who had ruin'd their Affairs were not ver  likely to retrieve them  Phocion  declar'd h  Opinion to the same effect concerning the Ge  nerals  Phocion  succeeds  Chares  in the Command  and it was upon this Occasion that h  was appointed to succeed  Chares  The  Byzantines  receiv'd him with great Mark  of Confidence and Friendship and he by act  ing in concert with them soon oblig'd  Philip  abandon his Design both upon  Byzantium  and  Perinthus  He raises both the Sieges  He also took some of his Ships recover'd several Places which he had garrison'd ravag'd the flat Part of the Country  and drives  Philip  out of the  Hellespont  and drove him out of the  Hellespont  It is said that the Siege of  Perinthus  was rais'd before by the  Persians  but whatever hand they had in it the Inhabitants of that Place as well as of  Byzantium  ascribed their Deliverance wholly to the  Athenians  and testified it in the most solemn manner giving them liberty to settle among them and intermarry with them and granting them greater Privileges and Immunities than their own Citizens enjoy'd They also consecrated Crowns and erected Statues to them The Inhabitants of the  Chersonese  in token of the like Deliverance rais'd Altars to the  Athenians  and decreed to them a Crown of Gold So terrible was the Name of  Philip  grown to the People in these Parts that they thought they could never give sufficient Proofs of their Gratitude to those who had freed them from him And as to himself his Disappointment in this Expedition with the Loss of a good Number of his Men was the greatest Mortification he had hitherto receiv'd This reduced him to his old Artifice of endeavouring to renew the Peace with  Athens  And he kept up the Appearance of negotiating it for the next two Years after the Siege of  Perinthus  But he was arming all the while and making new Infractions and  the subsequent Account of his Proceedings will shew that there was no way left of bringing things to a Determination but by the Sword  Without waiting the Result of his last Overture of the  Athenians  Philip's  Expedition into Scythia  he march'd against  Atheas  King of  Scythia  upon a pretence that he had not gratified him for the Assistance he had given him in his Wars against the  Istrians  The  Scythians  gave him battle but tho' they were far superior in Number he defeated them and carried off a great deal of Booty which consisted chiefly of Women and Children and Cattle and among the latter there were twenty thousand Mares for breeding In his Return the  Triballi  of  Moesia  pretending to a Share of the Spoil disputed his Passage and thereupon ensued a sharp Conflict wherein his Horse was kill'd under him and himself so wounded that he must have fallen into the Enemies hands if he had not been rescued by his Son  Alexander  who was with him in this Expedition and gave this early token of what might one Day be expected from him  The Peace in the mean time was under consideration at  Athens  His Overtures of Peace rejected at  Athens  and the People were divided concerning it according to the different Sentiments of their Leaders  Phocion  was for accepting it but was strongly oppos'd by  Demosthenes  and his Advice for rejecting it prevail'd When  Philip  sound the  Athenians  would not treat with him and that they were acting  offensively against him especially at Sea where they block'd up his Ports and put an intire stop to his Commerce  whereupon he forms new Alliances  he began to form new Alliances against them particularly with the  Thebans  and  Thessalians  without whom he knew he could not keep open his Passage into  Greece  At the same time he was sensible that his engaging these Powers to act directly against  Athens  and in his own personal Quarrel would have so bad an Aspect that they would not easily come into it For which reason he endeavour'd underhand to create new Disturbances in  Greece  and creates fresh Divisions in  Greece  that he might take such a part in them as would best answer his Views And when the Flame was kindled his Point was to appear rather to be call'd in as an Assistant than to act as a Principal  These fresh Commotions took their Rise from the  Locri Ozolae  who border'd upon the  Phocians  and were accus'd of the same Act of Profanation which they had committed in breaking up a piece of Ground belonging to the Temple of  Apollo  at  Delphi  And this Case was referr'd in the same manner as the former was to the  Amphictyons  who in order to form their Judgment upon the Matter in dispute went to take a view upon the Place but were so insulted and attack'd by the  Locrians  that they were forc'd to fly for it Hereupon both Sides had recourse to Arms and there was all the Appearance of a second  Holy War  But it was  not carried on with the same Zeal as the former it was ended almost as soon as it began and serv'd only to advance  Philip  's Authority in  Greece  His Designs promoted by Aeschines  This was owing chiefly to  Aeschines  who was secretly his Agent and had by his means got himself to be deputed on the part of  Athens  as one of the Members in the present Assembly of the  Amphictyons  When he found the War went on so heavily and that they who were to contribute towards it were very backward in sending in their Quota's he propos'd to the rest of the Deputies that the several States which they represented should either hire Foreign Troops and tax themselves to pay them or that in order to save that Trouble and Expence they should choose  Philip  for their General They readily swallow'd the Bait that was laid for them and agreed to the latter of these Proposals Hereupon a formal Embassy was sent to  Philip  to demand his Assistance in avenging the Honour of the Deity and to notify to him That the  Grecians  had by their Representatives in the Council of the  Amphictyons  Philip  chosen General against the  Locrians  chosen him their General for that purpose with full Power to proceed in the manner he should judge most proper  Philip  did not want much Persuasion to accept the Offer of that which he had so eagerly pursu'd and which was in effect the Completion of all his other Designs He unmediately got his Troops together and began  his March But instead of going on to chastise the  Lorcrians  He seizes upon Elat√™a  he made a sudden turn and seiz'd upon  Elat√™a  a capital City of  Phocis  which was very well situated for awing the  Thebans  of whom he began to grow jealous and for preparing his way to  Atheans  But by so extraordinary a Step as this he fairly threw off the Mask and bad defiance to the whole Body of the  Grecians  The  Athenians  alarm'd at it  The News of it arriving at  Athens  in the Evening the Trumpets sounded the Alarm and the City was fill'd with Terror and Amazement The next Morning the Assembly met and all the Generals and Orators assisted at it But when it was expected that some of the Members should rise to offer their Advice upon the present Exigency every body sat mute and confounded The Crier made Proclamation and demanded according to the usual Form  Who of them was dispos'd to speak  No body yet offering the same Question was several times repeated but still to no purpose At length  They are animated by  Demosthenes  in this general dead Silence  Demosthenes  rose up and endeavour'd to dispel their Fears and to animate them for their Defence The most immediate Danger they apprehended from  Philip  was his late Alliance with the  Thebans  and this was the point that  Demosthenes  labour'd chiefly to clear up to them and to make it appear that the  Thebans  were not so strongly attach'd to him as they imagin'd  For  if it were so  said he  we should not now have heard of his being at  Elat√™a  but in  Attica To which he added  That however the  Thebans  might before have been deluded by him this last Proceeding of his had more fully open'd their Eyes It is true  said he  some part of them he had gain'd by Mony and Artifice and he has drawn down his Troops to keep them in heart and to intimidate the rest who are the greatest Part and who have hitherto oppos'd him and would still continue to do so if they had any Prospect of being supported  Wherefore he propos'd That all who were able to bear Arms should march out of the City and make a general Rendezvous at  Eleusis  as well to set an Example to the rest of  Greece  for asserting the common Liberty as to shew the  Thebans  in particular that they were ready to protect and assist them And in regard to that inveterate Enmity and Rancour which had so long subsisted between  Athens  and  Thebes  he advis'd the People to suppress it for the present and not to revive the Memory of past Injuries which he told them would only serve to hinder or retard that Union and good Correspondence which were now become so necessary for their mutual Preservation He further propos'd That Ambassadors should be sent to the several States of  Greece  to make it a common Cause but especially and in the first place to the  Thebans  as they were more immediately expos'd and as they were the Barrier to  Athens  The Assembly readily agreed to this Advice of  Demosthenes  and pursuant thereto a Decree in form was drawn up with an additional Clause That a Fleet of two hundred Sail should be fitted out to cruize near  Thermopylae  There being no time to be lost in this Negotiation with the  Thebans  His Negotiation with the  Thebans  Ambassadors were forthwith dispatch'd to them with  Demosthenes  at the head of them and they were met by others on the part of  Philip  Python  opposes him  The principal of them was  Python  who was a  Byzantine  by Birth and had been made a free Citizen of  Athens  but was now in  Philip  's Interest He was a very able and forcible Speaker and therefore was upon this occasion oppos'd to  Demosthenes  The  Macedonians  were heard first the Preference being given to them as Friends and Allies They set out with large Encomiums upon  Philip  and after a long Recital of the many Benefits and Advantages the  Thebans  had receiv'd from him and the many Injuries and Provocations they had receiv'd from  Athens  they endeavour'd to excite their Gratitude on the one hand and to fire their Resentment on the other They also tempted them with the Hopes of Booty which they told them they should find in great abundance in  Attica  and that they would at the same time prevent the ravaging their own Country and making it the Seat of the War which would be the necessary Consequence of their entering into an Alliance with  Athens  Upon the whole they propos'd to them in the alternative either that they should join with  Philip  in the Invasion of  Attica  or that they should sit still and give him a free Passage thorugh  Boeotia  Demosthenes  by way of Reply used the same king of Reasoning with the  Thebans  as he had done with the  Athenians  to convince them of the Necessity of proceeding against  Philip  as their common Enemy For that whatever Words or Pretences he made use of his Designs were too visible from his Actions He instanc'd particularly in the manner of his seizing upon  Elat√™a  He told them  That in case he should succeed so far as to conquer  Attica Thebes  would suffer in its Turn That he would go on from one City and one Province to another and would never stop 'till he had made himself Master of the whole  The  Thebans  were not very inclinable to enter into any Engagements on either side They had too lively a Sense of the Miseries they had undergone especially whilst the Wounds they had receiv'd in the  Phocian  War were still fresh upon them But  Demosthenes  fired them to such a degree that they were no longer Masters of themselves The Force of his Eloquence upon this Occasion is said  to have cast a Mist over their Understanding to have carried them away like a Whirlwind and to have work'd them up to a sort of Enthusiasm  Insomuch that laying aside all  Fear and Gratitude  The  Thebans  enter into an Alliance with  Athens  and other prudential Considerations they declar'd themselves for the Alliance with  Athens  That which animated  Demosthenes  next to his Zeal for the publick Safety was his having to do with a Man of  Python  's Abilities and he some time after took occasion to value himself upon the Victory he had obtained over him  I did not give way  said he  to the boasting  Python  when he would have bore me down with a Torrent of Words  Demosthenes  values himself upon his Success  He gloried more in the Success of this Negotiation than of any other he had been employ'd in and spoke of it as his Masterpiece in Politicks It was certainly of the greatest Importance to  Athens  at this time when  Philip  seem'd fully bent on her Destruction and when she had no other immediate Prospect of Relief but from the gaining the  Thebans Demosthenes  therefore to do himself Justice put the People in mind of the Danger they had escap'd He told them  It was he who had dispersed that Cloud which hung over the City and that by this Instance of his unwearied Diligence and Zeal for the Publick he had exceeded all that had been done by the greatest Orators of former Ages  He was generally more modest than he appears to have been in this Case But it must be consider'd that what he said upon this Occasion was some time after in his Defence against  Aeschines  who by his artful and invidious insinuations had put him under a Necessity of enumerating his Services  to the Commonwealth and of setting them in the strongest Light they would bear  When  Philip  found himself thus disappointed of the  Thebans  Philip's Artifices to avoid fighting  he sued again to the  Athenians  for Peace but they saw his Drift too plainly to trust him and were too much exasperated to hearken to any Terms of Accommodation However he resolved to stand it out with them and both Sides prepared for Battle But before it came to Action he try'd another Stratagem which was by bribing the Oracle to terrify them with fatal Omens and predictions concerning the Event of it  Demosthenes  to prevent these Warnings making any deep Impression treated them with the utmost Contempt and it was upon this Occasion that he charged the Priestess with  Philippizing  He put the  Thebans  in mind of their  Epaminondas  and the  Athenians  of  Pericles  who he told them were govern'd by Reason and good Sense and would not suffer themselves to be carried away by such idle superstitious Fancies which they look'd upon only as a Cloak for Cowardice The  Athenians  were so eager for the War that they easily got the better of these frightful Apprehensions and  Demosthenes  had by his las  Treaty gain'd such an Ascendant both ove  them and the  Thebans  that they submitted them+selves intirely to his Directions  Accordingly they took the Field  Olymp  The Battle at  Cheron√™a  and encamp'd together near  Cheron√™a  in  Boeotia  where  Philip  met them with thirty thousand Foot and two thousand Horse He was somewhat superior to them in Numbers and more so in the Goodness of his Officers He gave the Command of the left Wing of his Army to his Son  Alexander  but in regard to his Youth he placed the best of his Officers about him and the right Wing he took to himself In the  Grecian  Army the  Thebans  were on the right and the  Athenians  on the left At Sunrising the two Armies join'd Battle and behav'd with such equal Courage and Bravery that it was long before any Impression was made on either side till at length  Alexander  exerting himself in an extraordinary manner broke in upon the  Sacred Band  of the  Thebans  and cut them to Pieces after which the rest of that Wing were easily routed  Philip  who had to do with the  Athenians  forc'd them likewise to give way But they soon recover'd their Ground and  Lysicles  who in Conjunction with  Chares  commanded the  Athenian  Troops push'd forwards into the Centre of  Philip  's Army where imagining himself victorious he cry'd out to his Men  Come on let us pursue them to  Macedonia  Philip  observing what pass'd and that  Lysicles  instead of attacking his Phalanx in Flank when he had so fair an Opportunity went on a wild disorderly Pursuit said cooly  The Athenians  don't know how to conquer  And thereupon h  drew up his Phalanx on a little Eminence from whence he pour'd down upon them and takin  them both in Flank and Rear  Philip  gains the Victory  intirely route them It was upon this Occasion that  De  mosthenes  threw down his Arms and was one  the first who fled And there is a ridiculou  Circumstance told of him that in his Flight hi  Clothes catching hold of a Bush he took it fo an Enemy and cry'd out for Quarter Ther  were above a thousand  Athenians  kill'd in th  Action and above two thousand taken Prisoners and the Loss on the Part of the  Thebans  was much the same  Philip  was transported with this Victory beyond measure  His Behaviour upon it  and having drank to Excess at an Entertainment which he gave upon that Occasion went into the Field of Battle where he insulted over the Slain and upbraided the Prisoners with their Misfortunes He leap'd and danc'd about in a frantick manner and with an Air of Burlesque sung the Beginning of the Decree which  Demosthenes  had drawn up as a Declaration of the War against him  Demades  who was in the Number of the Prisoners had the Courage to reproach him with this unge  nerous Behaviour telling him  That Fortune ha  given him the Part of  Agamemnon  but that h  was acting that of  Thersites He was so struck with the Justness of this Reproof that i  wrought a thorough Change in him and he  was so far from being offended at  Demades  that he immediately gave him his Liberty and shew'd him afterwards great Marks of Honour and Friendship He likewise releas'd all the  Athenian  Captives and without Ransom and when they found him so generously dispos'd towards them they made a Demand of their Baggage with every thing else that had been taken from them but to that  Philip  reply'd  Surely they think I have not beat them  This Discharge of the Prisoners was ascrib'd in a great measure to  Demades  who is said to have new modell'd  Philip  and to have soften'd his Temper with the  Attick Graces  as  Diodorus  expresses it And  Philip  himself acknowledg'd upon another Occasion that his frequent Converse with the  Athenian  Orators had been of great use to him in correcting his Morals  Justin  represents his Carriage after the Battle in a very different Light as that he took abundance of Pains to dissemble his Joy that he affected great Modesty and Compassion and was not seen to laugh that he would have no Sacrifice no Crowns nor Perfumes that he forbad all kind of Sports and did nothing that might make him appear to the Conquerors to be elated nor to the Conquer'd to be insolent But this Account seems to have been confounded with others which were given of him after his being reform'd by  Demades  It is certain that after his first Transport was over and that he began to recollect himself he shew'd great Humanity  to the  Athenians  and that in order stil  to keep measures with them he renew'd the Peace  He renews the Peace with  Athens  But the  Thebans  who had renounc'd their Alliance with him he treated in another manner He  His Severity towards the  Thebans  who affected to be as much Master of his Allies as of his Subjects could not easily pardon those who had deserted him in so critical a Conjuncture Wherefore he not only took Ransom for their Prisoners but made them pay for leave to bury their Dead It is further said that either by the Sword or by Banishment he clear'd the City of the principal Men who had stood in Opposition to him and confiscated their Goods That he recall'd all such as had been banish'd for espousing his Interest and made 'em Judges and Magistrates with a Power of Life and Death over those who had been the Authors of their Exile After these Severities and after having plac'd a strong Garrison over them he granted them a Peace  CHAP IV  From the Battle of Cheron√™a to the Death of Philip of Macedon Containing the Space of above One Year  THE Generality of the  Athenians  were not much dejected upon this Overthrow especially since  Philip  had shewn so much Moderation  towards them But they who saw further into the Consequences of it were not very easy in their present Situation  Isocrates  was more particularly affected with the Loss and Disgrace they had suffer'd and was so apprehensive that  Philip  would make some further use of his Victory that he chose rather to starve himself to death  Isocrates  starves himself  than to survive the Liberty of his Country Which is a sufficient Proof that his Intimacy with  Philip  which has before been mention'd was with an Intent to serve the Commonwealth and that his End was good tho' he was mistaken in the Means of attaining it and in the Man he had to deal with The Truth is he was not conversant enough in publick Affairs His proper Province was his School wherein he succeeded beyond any Man of his Time and he got so much Mony by it that he was oblig'd to build a Gally and maintain it at his own Charge  Plutarch  condemns him for his unactive and recluse way of Life and sets him in a very pedantick Light That he sat poring at home in his Study when every Body else was in Arms That instead of sharpening his Sword and his Spear and brightning up his Helmet he was adapting ranging and polishing his Words and Sentences and that he was three  Olympiads  in composing  His Panegyrick  one single Oration  How  says he  would that Man have been terrified at the clattering of Weapons or the routing of a Phalanx who was so afraid of  suffering one Vowel to clash with another or to pronounce a Word where the Syllables were uneven  But notwithstanding this Piece of Raillery he was generally respected and admir'd not only as a perfect Master in his Profession but as a thorough Wellwisher to his Country  The Enemies of  Demosthenes  were not wanting on this Occasion to accuse him as the Author of their Misfortunes But the Generality of the People still retain'd their former good Opinion of him  The Conduct of  Demosthenes  approved  and not only acquitted him of all that had been laid to his Charge but restor'd him to the Management of their Affairs and put themselves wholly under his Care and Guidance to provide for their future Security As a further Instance of their Regard for him they pitch'd upon him as the most proper Person to speak the Funeral Oration upon the Interment of the Slain Nothing could be a stronger Mark of their Approbation of his Services than the appointing him who had advis'd the War to celebrate the Memory of those who were kill'd in it And it is mention'd to the Honour of the People likewise that contrary to their usual Practice they had distinguish'd so rightly in the present Case of  Demosthenes  and judg'd of him according to the Zeal and Intention of his Service and not according to the Success  This Defeat was attributed chiefly to the ill Conduct of the Generals  Lysicles put to death  Lysicles  and  Chares  the former whereof the  Athenians  put to death  t the Instance of  Lycurgus  who had great Credit and Influence with the People but was a se  ere Judge and a most bitter Accuser  You  Lysicles said he  was General of the Army a thousand Citizens are slain two thousand taken Primers a Trophy has been erected to the Dishonour  f this City and all  Greece  is enslav'd You had the Command when all these things happen'd and yet you dare to live and view the Light of the  um and blush not to appear publickly in the Forum  Lysicles  who are born the Monument of your Country's Shame  Character of  Lycurgus  the Orator  This  Lycurgus  was one of the Orators of the first Rank and free from the general Corruption which then reign'd among them He manag'd the publick Treasure for twelve Years with great Uprightness and had all his Life long the Reputation of a Man of Honour and Virtue He encreas'd the Shipping supply'd the Arsenal drove the bad Men out of the City and fram'd several good Laws He kept an ex  ct Register of every thing he did during his Administration and when that was expir'd he caus'd it to be fix'd up to a Pillar that every Body might be at liberty to inspect it and to censure his Conduct He carried this Point so far that in his last Sickness he order'd himslef to be carried to the Senatehouse to give a publick Account of all his Actions and after he had refuted one who accus'd him there he went home and died Notwithstanding the Austerity of his Temper he was a great Encourager of  the Stage which tho' it had been carried to a Excess that was mainfestly hurtful to the Publick he still look'd upon as the best School to instru and polish the Minds of the People And this end he kept up a Spirit to Emulation mong the Writers of Tragedy and erected t  Statues of  Aeschylus Sophocles  and  Euripides  left three Sons who were unworthy of him an behav'd so ill that they were all put in Prison but  Demosthenes  out of regard to the Memory  their Father got them discharg'd  It does not appear  And of  Chares  that  Chares  underwent an Prosecution for his Share in this Action tho  according to his general Character he deserv'd  as much or more than his Colleague For he had no Talents for Command and was very little different from a common Soldier  Timotheus  sai  of him  That instead of being a General he was fitter to carry the General's Baggage  His Perso  indeed was of that robust kind of Make and  was that which serv'd in some measure to recommend him to the People But he was more Man of Pleasure than Fatigue In his Militar Expeditions he was wont to carry with him Band of Musick and he defray'd the Expenc  of it out of the Soldiers Pay Notwithstanding his want of Abilities he had a thorough goo  Opinion of himself He was vain and positiv  bold and boisterous a great Undertaker an  always ready to warrant Success but his P  formances seldom answer'd and hence it wa  that  Chares  's  Promises  became a Proverb And yet as little as he was to be depended on he had his Partizans among the People and among the Orators by whose Means he got himself to be frequently employ'd and others to be excluded who were more capable As he had no true Merit of his own he could the less bear it in those who had This was the Grounds of his malicious Charge against  Iphicrates  and  Timotheus  and the manner in which it was carried on has already been mention'd as a Reproach to the Commonwealth In short he was a bad Man as well as a bad Officer and did very little real Service or Honour to his Country either at home or abroad  This Year  Olymp  The Death and Character  of Timoleon  being the last of the hundred and tenth  Olympiad  died  Timoleon  He had some time before lost his Sight which he bore very patiently and the  Syracusians  to alleviate his Affliction and to shew their Respect and Gratitude to him went in great Numbers to visit him and carried with them all the Strangers in those Parts to entertain them with the Sight of their great Benefactor Notwithstanding his Blindness he continu'd to the last to give his Attention to the Publick When any Matter of Moment came before the Assembly he was conducted to the Theatre in a Sort of Carr and was usher'd in with the joyful Acclamations and Benedictions of the People and when he had deliver'd his Opinion they were always determin'd  by it He was buried at the Charge of the Publick with great Pomp and with a general Lamentation and Anniversary Games were in stituted to do Honour to his Memory Tha  which endear'd him so much to the  Syracusians  besides the great things he had done for them was his living and dying among them as thei  common Father and as a Native of  Sicily  without regard to the Honours and Applause that he might have receiv'd upon his return to  Greece  But he was a wise and moderate Man as well as valiant and fortunate he knew where to stop and how to enjoy the Fruits of his Conquests There is hardly an Instance of any other  Grecian  who after such Success went quietly to his Grave without exposing himself further so as to fall a Sacrifice either to his own Ambition or to the Insolence and Ingratitude of his Countrymen  Plutarch  observes a remarkable Difference between the Atchievements of  Timoleon  and those of his Contemporaries That in those of  Timotheus Agesilaus Pelopidas  and even of  Epaminondas  who was the Pattern that  Timoleon  copied after there was a certain Stiffness Labour and Struggling which took off from the Merit and Lustre of them but that those of  Timolcon  were like the Poetry of  Homer  and the Painting of  Nicomachus  which besides the Strength and Beauty that they had in common with others were more free and easy more gracesul and more masterly We can never too much admire and extol the  easy Progress that he made with an handful of Men in  Sicily  by driving out the Tyrants dispersing the numerous Fleets and Armies of the  Carthaginians  and taking  Syracuse  one of the strongest Cities of the World and which had so long withstood all the Power of  Athens  tho' it must be confess'd that it was not so well fortified nor so well defended now as in the Time of the  Peloponnesian  War But tho' his Actions were so generally applauded it happen'd once that two of the  Syracusians  who were popular Speakers brought a Charge against him for some Part of his Conduct as General and one of 'em demanded that he should give Security for his Appearance which the People were highly offended at as thinking that in his Case the ordinary Forms of Justice ought to be dispensed with But he would not suffer himself to be exempted from a due Observance of the Laws which he had taken so much Pains to enforce against others However when the Matter came to be heard he treated it as a Piece of Calumny and instead of going about to refute it he only thank'd the Gods that they had granted his Request for that he had liv'd to see the  Syracusians  now at Liberty to say whatever they thought fit He lest them in full Possession of the Liberty both of speaking and acting and they enjoy'd it about twenty Years till the ill use they made of it gave Rise to the Tyranny  of  Agathocles  who brought them again into their former Condition  The Battle of  Cheron√™a  was so decisive tha  from thence we may date the Downfal of the Liberties of  Greece  For tho'  Philip  did not pursue his Advantage so far as might naturally have been expected yet the Terror of his Arms kept the whole Country in awe and pav'd the Way to its more intire Subjection  Philip  proposes an Expedition against  Persia  The Point which he had in view and which he had long form'd in his Thoughts was an Expedition against  Persia  And as this was not easily to be carried on without the Assistance of the  Grecians  he engag'd them under a Pretence of revenging the Wrongs they had receiv'd from the  Barbarians  to join with him in it and got himself to be declar'd their Captain General  and is declared Captain General  which was a principal Motive with him in this Undertaking  But whilst he was making the necessary Preparations for this war he was diverted from it by the Affairs of his Family He suffer'd great Uneasiness with his Wife  Olympias  He divorces  Olympias  who was of a turbulent jealous and revengeful Temper and had also given him strong Suspicions of her Chastity insomuch that tho' there was no formal Proof against her he made it a Pretence to divorce her  Marries  Cleopatra  and married  Cleopatra  a very beautiful young Woman and Niece to  Attalus  one of his principal Officers  Attalus  was transported with the Honour done to his Family and being heated with Wine at the Marriage Feast said publickly  The  Macedonians  ought now to invoke the Gods that the new Queen might bring  Philip  a lawful Successor Alexander  who was before disgusted at the Treatment his Mother had met with was now more thorougly provok'd at that which so nearly concern'd himself  What  said he  Do you then take me for a Bastard  And in a Rage threw his Cup at him which  Attalus  return'd  Philip  who sat at another Table was so incens'd at what had pass'd  uarrels with his Son  Alexander  that he drew his Sword and run at his Son as the Disturber of the Feast but being lame he fell down and gave the Company time to interpose But  Alexander  was not to be pacified they had much ado to keep him from destroying himself He was so far from submitting himself to his Father that he rallied him upon his Fall  In troth  said he  the  Macedonians  are mighty well fitted with a General to conduct them out of  Europe  into  Asia  who is not able to go from one Table to another without danger of breaking his Neck  With this Sarcasm he quitted the Room and retir'd to  Illyrium  having first carried his Mother to  Epirus  But this Affair was afterwards made up by Means of  Demaratus  a  Corinthian  who being in great Credit and Confidence with  Philip  made him sensible that he had gone too far in his Resentment against his Son and thereupon was sent to bring him back  Philip  soon after this Accident met with another of the same kind which prov'd more fatal to him  The Marriage of his Daughter  Cleopatra  This happen'd upon the Marriage of his Daughter  Cleopatra  with  Alexander  King of  Epirus  and Brother of  Olympias Philip  to add to the Solemnity of the Nuptials and to do himself Honour upon his intended Expedition which he had still very much at Heart made a most magnificent Entertainment and invited all the most considerable Men of  Greece  taking this Opportunity to testify his Gratitude for their having chosen him their General The several Cities from whence they came were not wanting on their Part to compliment him on the Occasion and to flatter his Vanity They vy'd with one another in sending him Crowns of Gold and  Athens  was not less zealous and devoted to him than the rest The next Day after the Feast there were publick Shews to be exhibited and  Philip  went in great Pomp to assist at them being dress'd in a white Robe and his Nobles and Guards attending him in the form of a Procession There were carry'd before him twelve Images of the Gods of exquisite sine Workmanship and a thirteenth was added which was more splendid than the rest and was to represent himself as One among the Number of the Deities But in the Heighth of the Solemnity amidst the joyful Acclamations of a numberless Croud of Spectators from all Parts and just as his Statue enter'd the  Theatre the Ceremony was interrupted by  Pausanias  a young  Macedonian  Nobleman He had some time before been grosly affrnoted by  Attalus  who after he had made him drunk carnally abused him and then prostituted him to others  Pausanias  made his Complaint to the King and demanded Justice But  Philip  did not care to hearken to an Accusation against the Queen's Uncle The young Man renew'd his Suit and was so importunate for Redress that at last  Philip  to pacify him gave him a Commission of the first Rank in his Guards  Pausanias  did not look upon this as a Satisfaction for the Injury he had receiv'd and tho' he stifled his Revenge for some time he took the present Occasion of executing it in the most publick manner upon the Person of the King  Philip  had order'd his Guards both before and behind to keep at a proper Distance from him so as to leave him room enough to appear more conspicuously to the People and as he march'd alone in that intermediate Space  Pausanias  made up to him drew his Dagger and stabb'd him  Philip  kill'd  by Pausanias  and left him dead upon the Spot  Pausanias  had Horses ready for his Escape and had like to have succeeded in it but one of his Feet being hamper'd in a Vinc he was taken and cut to Pieces  Olympias  is said to have provided the Horses for this purpose  Olympias  accessary to the Murther  and was look'd upon not only as privy to the Murther but as the chief Promoter of it Neither was  Alexander  himself quite free from Suspicion But his Mother was so far from concealing the Part she had in it that she affected to make it publick and was only afraid lest the Proofs should not appear strong enough against her The very Night she went to assist at the King's Funeral she caus'd a Crown of Gold to be put upon the Head of  Pausanias  whilst he was hanging upon a Cross Some Days after she buried him and erected a Tomb for him and appointed an Anniversaryday to be kept in Honour of his Memory She likewise consecrated the Dagger with which he committed the Fact Then she turn'd her Rage against  Cleopatra  for whom she had been divorced and having murther'd her Infant Child at her Breast caus'd her to be hang'd From these and several other Instances which might be given of her Cruelty and Revenge it may easily be believ'd that she was more than consenting to the Assassination of the King and that she made use of the Resentment of  Pausanias  to satisfy her own  The News of  Philip  's Death was a joyful Surprise in  Greece  and particularly in  Athens  where the People crown'd themselves with Garlands  The manner in which the News of  Philip'  s Death was receiv'd at  Athens  and decreed a Crown to  Pausanias  They sacrific'd to the Gods for their Deliverance and sung Songs of Triumph as if  Philip  had been slain by them in Battle But this Excess of Joy did ill become them It was look'd upon as an ungenerous and unmanly Insult upon the  Ashes of a murther'd Prince and of one whom they just before had rever'd and crouch'd to in the most abject manner These immoderate Transports were rais'd in them by  Demosthenes  who having the first Intelligence of  Philip  's Death went into the Assembly unusually gay and chearful with a Chaplet on his Head and in a rich Habit tho' it were then but the seventh Day after the Death of his Daughter From this Circumstance  Plutarch  at the same time that he condemns the Behaviour of the  Athenians  in general upon this Occasion takes an Handle to justify  Demosthenes  and extols him as a Patriot for not suffering his Domestick Afflictions to interfere with the Goodfortune of the Commonwealth But he certainly might have acted the Part of a good Citizen with more Decency and Composure and more to the Honour of himself and his Country  This Accident happen'd to  Philip  in the forty seventh Year of his Age  A M Olymp  and the twenty fifth of his Reign during which time he was constantly in Action 'till by Degrees he chang'd the whole Face of Affairs both in  Greece  and  Macedonia  The Steps by which he advanc'd  His Character  were firm and sure but withal so slow and imperceptible that he seem'd to have no great Share of Ambition and yet in reality Nobody had more but Nobody had it so much under Command nor knew so well how to disguise it  It was varnish'd over as as his Actions in general were with false Colours it had the Appearance of Justice and Humanity and Beneficence to Mankind in protecting the Innocent redressing the Injur'd and extirpating Tyranny But his Acts of this kind were only plausible Methods of advancing his own Grandeur and Authority and of subverting the Publick Liberty under a Pretence of defending it  He was admirably well qualified for the part he acted For he had an equal Mixture of Fire and Phlegm which serv'd to correct each other The first put him upon forming great Designs and the latter conducted him in the Execution of them so that his Success was owing chiefly to this due Temperament which made him cautious without Fear and bold without Rashness When he had taken his point he kept it always in view and conceal'd it from every body else For he trusted no body further than was necessary he had Favourites but no Confidents He was his own Minister his own General and his own Treasurer and as he had all the Capacity Vigilance and Activity which these several Offices requir'd he was intirely Master of his own Schemes and of the Execution of them Which  Demosthenes  takes notice of as a particular Advantage that he had over the  Athenians  by being so secret in his Deliberations and so uncontroul'd in his Actions And the Case was much  the same in the other Republicks where Matters of the most secret Importance were canvass'd and debated in their popular Assemblies the Resolutions taken upon those Debates were made publick and the Hands of those who were to executed them were tied up and by these means they generally lost their Effect especially with regard to  Philip  who knew so well the Constitution of  Greece  and the Use that was to be made of such a Method of proceeding  He look'd upon all means of attaining his ends to be justifiable and he had Expedients of all kinds and for all Occasions He knew all the different ways that were to lead him to his Mark but he generally chose that which was most dark and intricate and out of the common Road He lov'd Feints and Stratagems for the Pleasure of deceiving and he valued himself less upon the Success of a Battle than of a Negotiation For which reason he seldom employ'd Force 'till his Artifices fail'd him And yet when he found himself obliged to have recourse to Arms no body behaved with more Bravery and Intrepidity nor with better Conduct  Plutarch  therefore bears too hard upon him when speaking of him by way of comparison with  Epaminondas  He says He had none of the principal Virtues of that Great Man and among his other Defects mentions his want of Courage But there does not appear to be the  least Foundation for this Charge and it has been refuted by his greatest Enemy  Demosthenes  who describes him with his Eye out his Collarbone broke his Hand and his Leg maim'd and then adds That he had seen this  Philip  thus wounded from Head to Foot still ready to throw himself into the midst of Dangers and to sacrifice the rest of his Body in the further Pursuit of Glory  He infused the same Spirit into his Soldiers who were so animated by his Example and so inured to Action that he could always depend on them He had also a way of gaining their Affections He would call them his Comrades and treat them otherwise with great Familiarity and he did it in such a manner as neither to lessen his Authority nor relax the Discipline They were grown so hardy and expert under him that the  Macedonian  Troops were reckon'd at this time almost as much superior to the  Grecians  as the  Grecians  were to the  Persians  These were the Men whom  Clytus  afterwards reproach'd  Alexander  with when he told him  It was his Father's Troops by which he had conquer'd Alexander  was too sensible of the truth of it  and it cost the old Man his Life  If  Philip  had been equal in other respects to what he was in the Field he had made a glorious Figure But his Tricks and Subterfuges and deep Dissimulation his gross Bribery Trea  chery and Breach of Faith which make up the main of his Character have cast such a Shade over his real good Qualities that they are hardly to be distinguish'd and have given occasion to call even his military Virtues in question But in that respect he was undoubtedly superior to all the Captains of his time And he had otherwise great Talents He had a fine Understanding with a strong and clear Judgment great Prudence and Foresight great Variety of Learning and other acquir'd Knowledge He spoke and wrote with great Ease Propriety and Dignity but with too much Art and Subtilty For there was Design and Insincerity in every thing he said whether he were in jest or in earnest He always promis'd more than he intended to perform and he had as little regard to his Oath as to his Promise To this purpose he had a Saying  That Children were to be cheated with Playthings and Men with Oaths  And yet notwithstanding this impious Maxim of his he made a great Shew of Religion and it was that which gain'd him his first footing in  Greece  in the  Phocian  War Among his other Arts of Hypocrisy by which he impos'd upon the World we may reckon that of his being attended every Morning by a Servant to put him in mind of his Mortality His Friendships were govern'd wholly by his Interest They were only mercenary Engagements that he had  enter'd into with bad Men and for bad Ends and when they had serv'd his Purpose he had done with them This was the Case of most of his Agents who sold their Country to him he paid them their Price and then discarded them for he lov'd the Treason but not the Traytor  Of which there was a memorable Instance in his Treatment of the two Magistrates who betray'd  Olynthus  to him When they found themselves universally scouted and contemn'd for that Act of Treachery and even by the common Soldiers in his own Army they applied to him for Protection and Redress but he gave them a very short Answer and a very cutting one  O  said he  you must not mind what such blunt Fellows say who call every thing by its own Name  He had a particular Faculty of setting two Friends at variance and by that means of getting into their Confidence And this was his main Artifice in the carrying on his Designs against  Greece  by sowing Jealousies fomenting Quarrels and playing one State against another and when he had by these Methods broke into their Alliances and separated their Interests the remaining Part was not difficult His hardest Task was with the  Athenians  with whom he was continually either fighting or treating And tho' they had 'till his time the Reputation of a more resined Wit than their Neighbours and of more Sagacity Penetration and Attention  to their Interests yet he found means to amuse and confound them to delude and insatuate them to corrupt and divide them  He was not so taken up in the pursuit of his Ambition but that he found time for his Pleasures wherein he indulg'd himself in a very dissolute and licentious manner and in this part of his Life he acted openly and without Reserve He lov'd Riot and Drunkenness and Intemperance of all kinds and encourag'd them so much in others that he was surrounded with a Set of lewd Parasites and Debauchees Players Buffoons and Pantomimes who engross'd all his Favours and shar'd all his Bounty but amidst these Excesses he had or affected to have some Sense of Shame so that when he had committed any Acts of Violence or Injustice he would easily bear Reproof and often repair the Injury There was a Woman who put her self in his way after he had been sitting long at Table and demanded justice of him He heard her Case and determin'd against her  Then  said she  I will appeal What From your King  said  Philip And who is it you would appeal to To  Philip  when he is sober  she replied Whereupon he examin'd the Afsair over again and finding he had given a wrong Judgment made a new one in her Favour Another Woman had long solicited an Audience of him upon a like Occasion and being  put off from time to time with a pretence that he was not at leisure she could bear no longer but said to him  If you have not time to do me Justice cease to be King  He was so far from resenting her manner of reproaching him that he immediately redress'd her Grievance and from thenceforwards he became more exact in giving Audience to his Subjects There was another Instance of a good sort of Man whom he was advis'd to banish for having spoken ill of him  No  said  Philip Let me consider first whether I have not given him Occasion for it  And being afterwards inform'd that he had never given him any Mark of his Favour and that he was in bad Circumstances he reliev'd him When the Man had tasted of his Bounty he chang'd his Note and spoke as much in his Praise which gave occasion to  Philip  to make another Reflection  That Kings have it in their own power to be belov'd or hated  He has given several other Proofs of his  swallowing Injuries  as  Longinus  calls it and some remarka  Instances of his Clemency and Forbearan  have been already mention'd in the Recit  of his Actions  Thus by a Mixture of some good Qualities with a great many bad ones he accomplish'd his Ends so far at least that he had throughly open'd the Way to the Destruction of the Liberties of  Greece  and laid the Foundation of all his  Son's Glory And if the Actions of each of them be duly weigh'd it will be found that  Philip  's Part was the more difficult of the two For it was certainly easier to conquer  Asia  with the Assistance of the  Grecians  than to break the Power of the  Grecians  who had so often beat the  Asiaticks  Wherefore we may venture to pronounce That tho'  Alexander  was the greater Conqueror  Philip  was the greater Man However they were both form'd for the Task they undertook If  Philip  had liv'd to pass over into  Asia  his artful and deliberate Valour would not in all Likelihood have had so good an Effect there as the Heroick Ardour and Impetuosity of his Son which bore down every thing that oppos'd him and which carried him on with such Rapidity through the whole Body of the  Persian  Empire But however  Philip  might have succeeded in that Expedition it seems pretty extraordinary that he should think of entring upon it before he had made a more intire Conquest of  Greece  which was certainly his original Plan and the Point in which all his other Views center'd And his Success at  Cheron√™a  had given him the  airest Prospect he ever had of subduing the whole Country It had put the  Athenians  and the  Thebans  so far in his Power that they were expecting every Hour to have his Yoke impos'd on them  As to the  Spartans  tho' they had avoided entering into the Quarrel it is hardly to be suppos'd they would tamely have submitted to him After the Battle he wrote them an haughty Letter to try how they would relish his Authority  But in Answer to it their King  Archidamus  the Son of  Agesilaus  sent him word  That if he measur'd his Shadow he would find it no bigger after his Victory than it was before  The Answer they sent him to another Letter of the same kind was  Dionysius to Corinth  However they were not in a Condition singly to make Head against him and the other subordinate States were so weak and disunited and withal so indolent and remiss that there was no immediate Appearance of forming any considerable League against him But whether he thought the  Grecians  were still too formidable for him to act in open Defiance of them and that his Shew of Moderation and Humanity and his Arts of Insinuation were easier and safer Methods of gaining further Ground upon them or whether he really contented himself with the having humbled them and with the Honour of presiding in their Great Council and of leading them forth to Battle under the Title of their General it is certain that he did not pursue his first Scheme of Conquest against them nor make use of the Advantages that he had then in his Hands He had still lest them in a Condition  to recover their former Liberty if they had had any Remains of their former Spirit But that was so broken and decay'd that they became an easy
