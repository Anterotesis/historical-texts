 BOADICIA  A TRAGEDY As it is acted at the THEATREROYAL IN  DRURYLANE  By Mr GLOVER  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in Pallmall and M COOPER in Paternosterrow  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr MOSSOP  BESIDE his native Thames our poet long  Hath hung his silent harp and hush'd his song  Kind Commerce whisper'd "See my blissful state  "And to no smiles but mine resign thy fate  "Beneath the pregnant branches rest awhile  "Which by my culture spread this favour'd isle  "On that fair tree the fruits of ev'ry coost  "All which the Ganges and the Volga boast  "All which the sun's luxuriant beam supplies  "Or slowly ripens under frozen skies  "In mix'd variety of growth arise  "The copious leaves beneficence diffuse  "Which on affliction drops restoring dews  "And birds of hope among the loaded sprays  "Tune with enchantment their alluring lays  "To cheer despondence and th' inactive raise  "Rest here she cry'd and smiling time again  "May string thy lyre and I approve the strain"  At length his muse from exile he recalls  Urg'd by his patrons in Augusta's walls  Those gen'rous traders who alike sustain  Their nation's glory on th' obedient main  And bounteous raise affliction's drooping train  They who benignant to his toils afford  Their shelt'ring favour have his muse restor'd  They in her future fame will justly share  But her disgrace herself must singly bear  Calm bours of learned leisure they have giv'n  And could no more for genius is from heav'n  To open now her longhid roll she tries  When vary'd forms of pictur'd passions rise  Revenge and pride their furies first unfold  By artless virtue fatally controll'd  Scenes wrought with gentler pencils then succeed  Where love persuades a faithful wife to bleed  Where join'd to publick cares domestic woe  Is seen from manly fortitude to flow  But if her colours mock the candid eye  By spurious tincts unmix'd with nature's dye  Ye friendly hands restrain your fruitless aid  And with just censure let her labours fade  Dramatis personae  DUMNORIX  by  Mr GARRICK  TENANTIUS  Mr BURTON  EBRANCUS  Mr MOZEEN  FLAMINIUS  Mr HAVARD  AENOBARBUS  Mr MOSSOP  BOADICIA  Mrs PRITCHARE  VENUSIA  Mrs CIBBER  ROMAN AMBASSADOR ICENIANS and TRINOBANTIANS  SCENE  the  British  camp before the tent of  Dumnorix  BOADICIA  ACT I  SCENE  the First  BOADICIA DUMNORIX ICENIANS TRINOBANTIANS  and  ROMAN  Ambassadors  ROMAN  Ambassador  SUETONIUS leader of the Roman arms  With gentlest greetings to th' Icenian queen  And Dumnorix the Trinobantian chief  Sends health and proffers friendship Let the wrongs  The mutual wrongs sustain'd by Rome and Britain  BOADICIA  May stern Andate war's victorious goddess  Again resign me to your impious rage  If e'er I blot my suff'rings from remembrance  If e'er relenting mercy cool my vengeance  Till I have driv'n you to our utmost shores  And cast your legions on the crimson'd beach  Your costly dwellings shall be sunk in ashes  Your fields be ravag'd your aspiring bulwarks  O'erturn'd and levell'd to the meanest shrub  Your gasping matrons and your children's blood  With mingled streams shall dye the British sword  Your captive warriors victims at our altars  Shall croud each temple's spacious round with death  Else may each pow'r to whom the Druids bend  Annul my hopes of conquest and revenge  DUMNORIX  to the Ambassador  You come to offer terms Stand forth and answer  Did not Prasutagus her dying lord  On your insatiate emperor bestow  Half of his rich possessions vainly deeming  The rest might pass unpillag'd to his children  What did you then ye savage sons of rapine  You seiz'd the whole inheritance by force  Laid waste our cities with the servile scourge  Disgrac'd a royal matron you deflow'r'd  Her spotless daughters stole our noblest youth  To serve your pride and luxury in Rome  Our priests you butcher'd and our hoary elders  Profan'd our altars our religious groves  And the baseimage of your Caesar thrust  Among the gods of Britain and by heav'n  Do you repair to these victorious tents  With proffer'd peace and friendship  ROMAN  Ambassador  Yes to treat  As faith benevolence and justice dictate  DUMNORIX  How shall we treat with those whose impious hands  Have rent the sacred bands of mutual trust  How shall we treat with those whose stony hearts  Compassion cannot melt nor shame controll  Nor justice awe nor piety restrain  Nor kindness win nor gratitude can bind  ROMAN  Ambossador  Thou art a stranger to our gen'ral's virtues  No pillager like Catus but a soldier  To calm and sober discipline inur'd  He would redress not widen your complaints  DUMNORIX  Can he restore the violated maid  To her untainted purity and fame  Can he persuade inexorable death  To yield our slaughter'd elders from the grave  No nor by soothing tales elude our vengeance  ROMAN  Ambassador  Yet hear us calmly e'er from yonder hills  You call the legions of imperial Rome  And wake her eagles which would sleep in peace  BOADICIA  Begone and bear defiance to your legions  Tell them I come that Boadicia comes  Fierce with her wrongs and terrible in vengeance  To roll her chariot o'er their firmest ranks  To mix their soaring eagles with the dust  And spurn their pride beneath her horses hoofs  ROMAN  Ambassador  Then be prepar'd for war  BOADICIA  We are prepar'd  Come from your hills ye fugitive remains  Of shatter'd cohorts by their fear preserv'd  Th' embattled nations of our peopled isle  Yet fresh from sev'nty thousand slaughter'd Romans  Shall add yon refuse to the purple heap  And yet amid triumphant desolation  Though flames each Roman colony devour  Though each distracted matron view her infant  Grasp with its tender hands the piercing spear  Though your grey fathers to the falchion's edge  Each feeble head surrender my revenge  Will pine unsated and my greatness want  Redress proportion'd to a queen's disgrace  DUMNORIX  Go and report this answer to Suetonius  Too long have parents sighs the cries of orphans  And tears of widows signalized your sway  Since your ambitious Julius first advanc'd  His murd'rous standard on our peaceful shores  At length unfetter'd from his patient sloth  The British genius lifts his pond'rous hands  To hurl with ruin his collected wrath  For all the wrongs a century hath borne  In one black period on the Roman race  ROMAN  Ambassador  Yet e're we part your price of ransom name  For the two captive Romans  BOADICIA  Not the wealth  Which loads the palaces of sumptuous Rome  Shall bribe my fury Hence and tell your legions  The hungry ravens which inhabit round  The chalky cliffs of Albion shall assemble  To feast upon the limbs of these your captains  Shall riot in the gore of Roman chiefs  These Masters of the World Produce the pris'ners  To an  Icenian  SCENE  the Second  BOADICIA DUMNORIX ICENIANS TRINOBANTIANS ROMAN AMBASSADORS AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  in Chains  BOADICIA  to the Ambassador  Stay if thou will't and see our victims fall  AENOBARBUS  to  BOADICIA  Dart not on me thy fiery eyes barbarian  Vain are thy efforts to dismay a Roman  Life is become unworthy of my care  And these vile limbs by galling chains dishonour'd  I give most freely to the wolves and thee  ROMAN  Ambassador  Mistaken queen the Romans do not want  These instigations nor thy proud defiance  To meet your numbers in the vale below  AENOBARBUS  to the Ambassador  Then wherefore do'st thou linger here in vain  Commend us to Suetonius bid him streight  Arrange his conquering legions in the field  There teach these rash barbarians to repent  Of their disdain and wish for peace too late  ROMAN  Ambassador  to  AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  Yes to Suetonius and the Roman camp  These heavy commendations will we bear  That for two gallant countrymen our love  And indignation at their fate may sharpen  Each weapon's point and strengthen ev'ry nerve  Till humbled Britain have appeas'd their shades  SCENE  the Third  BOADICIA DUMNORIX ICENIANS TRINOBANTIANS AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  AENOBARBUS  Come let us know our fate  BOADICIA  Prepare for Death  AENOBARBUS  Then cease to loiter savage  DUMNORIX  to  AENOBARBUS  Now by heav'n  Wert thou no Roman I could save and love thee  That dauntless spirit in another breast  And in a blameless cause were truly noble  But shews in thee the murderer and ruffian  AENOBARBUS  Thy hate or favour are alike to me  FLAMINIUS  to  DUMNORIX  May I demand illustrious Trinobantian  Why must we fall because uncertain war  Hath made us captives  DUMNORIX  If in open battle  With gen'rous valour to have fac'd our arms  Were all our charge against thee thou mightst rest  Secure of life but leading thee to die  Is execution on a gen'ral robber  AENOBARBUS  to  FLAMINIUS  And dost thou meanly sue to these barbarians  FLAMINIUS  to  DUMNORIX  Though our rapacious countrymen have drawn  Your just resentment we are guiltless borh  BOADICIA  to  FLAMINIUS  So are ten thousand infants whom the name  The single name of Roman shall condemn  Like thee to perish by th' unsparing sword  FLAMINIUS  Yet more than guiltless we may plead desert  With Boadicia  BOADICIA  Insolent pretension  A Roman plead desert with Boadicia  This shall enlarge the portion of thy suff'rings  For this not only shall thy blood embrue  Andate's shrine but torture shall be added  And fury wanton in thy various pains  AENOBARBUS  to  BOADICIA  Produce thy tortures them and thee we scorn  TENANTIUS  to the  TRINOBANTIANS  Fall back with rev'rence Trinobantian soldiers  See who advances from your gen'ral's tent  SCENE  the Fourth  BOADICIA DUMNORIX ICENIANS TRINOBANTIANS AENOBARBUS FLAMINIUS  and  VENUSIA  VENUSIA  Victorious sister may th' unresting labour  Of fortune weave new honours to adorn thee  And Dumnorix thy colleague and my lord  But if amid these warlike consultations  Ere yet the order'd pomp of battle moves  A supplicating sound may reach thy ear  Stoop from thy glory to an act of mercy  Thy doom pronounc'd on these unhappy captives  BOADICIA  Ha  VENUSIA  Their deservings and thy daughter's pray'r  Mix'd with my own compassion from the tent  Have call'd me forth a suitor to thy pity  That thou would'st hear and spare them  BOADICIA  Spare these captives  DUMNORIX  Why this request Venusia  VENUSIA  Give them hearing  They can unfold a story which demands  Your whole attention  DUMNORIX  Let us hear Proceed  To  Flam  FLAMINIUS  The Romans' late injustice we abhorr'd  Nor join'd the band of spoilers In that season  We chanc'd one day to wander through the forest  Which parts our confines from th' Icenian land  We found a beauteous virgin in our way  BGADICIA  Wretch dost thou hope to barter with our sister  For thy base life  FLAMINIUS  I fear not death O queen  But dread dishonour ev'n among my foes  AENOBARBUS  to  FLAMINIUS  Death is thy terrour reason else would teach thee  No gratitude with cruelty can dwell  FLAMINIUS  Deep in that wood we met the lovely maid  Chac'd by a brutal soldier At our threats  He soon retreated To our home we led her  From insult guarded sent her back with honour  Nor was she less than Boadicia's daughter  VENUSIA  Now dearest sister whose successful standard  Not valour more than equity upholds  And thou my husband who dost rise in arms  Oppressive deeds in others to chastise  From your own guiding justice will you stray  And blend deservers with the herd of guilt  DUMNORIX  And are you Romans Yes we will Venusia  Repay their worthy deed Strike off their fetters  BOADICIA  What do I hear A British chief's command  Whoe'er unchains a Roman on mankind  Lets loose oppression insolence and rapine  Sets treason falshood vice and murder free  VENUSIA  Yet these preserv'd thy Emmeline from shame  BOADICIA  Not less the victim of eternal shame  Was she conducted to their hateful mansion  To guard her honour and be less than ruffians  Had been repugnant to their name and race  But fear of me compell'd them to release her  Then shall two Romans nurs'd in fraud and falshood  From childhood train'd to each flagitious deed  By colour'd pleas to shun the fate they merit  Here find regard against the thousand mouths  Of Boadicia's suff'rings No this moment  Shall they expire in torture  VENUSIA  Yet reflect  Of all the paths which lead to human bliss  The most secure and grateful to our steps  With mercy and humanity is mark'd  The sweettongu'd rumour of a gracious deed  Can charm from hostile hands th' uplifted blade  The gall of anger into milk transform  And dress the brows of enmity in smiles  BOADICIA  Still dost thou dare Venusia  DUMNORIX  Gently sister  And trust me these resemble virtuous men  BOADICIA  Was not I virtuous whom the Romans lash'd  Were not my violated children virtuous  Bear them this instant to the fiercest rack  And while their trembling limbs are strain'd with torture  While thro' the cruel agony of pain  The bloody drops bedew their shiv'ring cheeks  Tell them how gentle are the pangs they feel  To those the soul of Boadicia prov'd  When Roman rage her naked limbs expos'd▪  And mark'd her flesh with everduring shame  DUMNORIX  to the Britons  Withhold your Hands  BOADICIA  What means the Trinobantian  DUMNORIX  To save thy benefactors and proclaim  Whate'er by valour we extort from fortune  We yet deserve by justice  BOADICIA  To contend  With Boadicia and protect her foes  Did she awaken thy ignoble sloth  Which else without resentment of thy wrongs  Had slept obscure at home  DUMNORIX  Forbear Be calm  BOADICIA  Yes under bondage thou hadst tamely bow'd  Had not I fir'd thy slow inactive soul  DUMNORIX  Not with unbridled passion I confess  I wield the sword and mount the warlike car  With careful eyes I view'd our suff'ring isle  And meditated calmly to avenge her  Unmov'd by rage my soul maintains her purpose  Through one unalter'd course and oft before  As I have guided thy unruly spirit  Against its wildness will I now protect thee  And from a base inhuman action save thee  BOADICIA  Thy boasted calmness is the child of fear  Thou tremblest to exasperate the foe  Well was it Britons in our former conquests  That I presided o'er the scene of slaughter  Else had those thousands of the Roman youth  Whose bodies lie extended on our fields  Stood at this hour a threatning host against you  Come then ye warriors follow your conductress  And drag these slaves to death  DUMNORIX  They will not move  Fix'd with amazement at thy matchless frenzy  Do thou revere these warriors who with scorn  Observe thy folly  VENUSIA  Husband sister hear  Oh if my humbled voice my prostrate limbs  If tears and sighs of anguish may atone  For this pernicious discord I have rais'd  BOADICIA  to  VENUSIA  Hence with thy despicable sighs and tears  To  Dumnorix  And thou presumptuous what invidious power  Foe to thy safety animates thy pride  Still to contend with Boadicia's wrath  DUMNORIX  No by Andate I contend not with thee  At this important season when the soldier  Thirsts for the conflict it would ill become me  To trifle here in discord with a woman  Nay do not swell that haughty breast in vain  When once the sacred evidence of justice  Illuminates my bosom on a rock  Which neither tears can soften nor the gusts  Of passion move my resolution stands  BOADICIA  Now heav'n fulfil my curses on thy head  May ev'ry purpose of thy soul be frustrate  May infamy and ruin overtake thee  May base captivity and chains o'erwhelm thee  May shameful crimson from thy shoulders start  Like mine dishonour'd with the servile scourge  With pain all shiv'ring and thy flesh contracting  Low mayst thou crouch beneath th' expected stroke  Ev'n from the hands thou sav'st  TENANTIUS  Alas great princess  Divert this wrath against th' impending foe  Whose formidable ranks will soon descend  From yonder hill  BOADICIA  to the Britons  Ungrateful and perfidious  Now would I draw my spirit from your camp  Leave you with him defenceless and expos'd  Then should your shatter'd chariots be o'erthrown  Your jav'lins broken and in hasty flight  Far from your trembling hands the buckler cast  Did not th' insatiate thirst which burns my soul  To empty ev'ry vein of Roman blood  Protect you traitors from my indignation  But by th' ensanguin'd altars of Andate  Thou Dumnorix be sure shall't rue this day  For thou henceforward art to me a Roman  SCENE  the Fifth  DUMNORIX VENUSIA TENANTIUS EBRANCUS TRINOBANTIANS AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  VENUSIA  Oh Dumnorix  DUMNORIX  Let not this frantic woman  Grieve thy mild natureRomans cease to fear  These are my tents retire in safety thither  SCENE  the sixth  DUMNORIX VENUSIA TENANTIUS EBRANCUS  and  TRINOBANTIANS  DUMNORIX  to  TENANTIUS  Do thou go forth this instant and command  Each ardent youth to gird his falchion round him  His pond'rous spear to loosen from the turf  And  race the target firmly on his a  m  His car let ev'ry charioteer prepare  His warlike seat each combatant assume  That ev'ry banner may in battle wave  Ere the sun reaches his meridian height  SCENE  the seventh  DUMNORIX VENUSIA EBRANCUS  and  TRINOBANTIANS  VENUSIA  My lord and husband  DUMNORIX  Wherefore dost thou hold me  And in my passage thy endearments plant  I must prepare this moment to confront  The foul and ghastly face of cruel war  And by the gods I rather court at present  That shape of horrour than thy beauteous form  Then go thou dear intruder and remove  Thy softness from me  VENUSIA  I will stay no longer  Than brave Tenantius hath perform'd thy orders  Long have I known thy valour skill'd to throw  The rapid dart and lift th' unconquer'd shield  A confidence like this hath still diffus'd  Enough of firmness thro' my woman's heart  Ne'er to molest thee with a woman's fears  This day excepted now my weakness governs  And terror too importunate will speak  Hast thou encounter'd yet such mighty powers  As down that mountain suddenly will rush  From ev'ry part the Romans are assembled  All vers'd in arms and terrible in valour  DUMNORIX  Tell me thou lovely coward am not I  As terrible or falls the Roman sword  On the tough buckler and the crested helm  With deadlier weight than mine away and fear not  Secure and calm repose thee in thy tent  Think on thy husband and believe he conquers  Amid the rage of battle he will think  On thee for thee he draws the martial blade  For thy lov'd infants gripes the pointed ash  Go and expect me to return victorious  Thy hand shall dress my wounds and all be well  VENUSIA  Far better be our fortune than for thee  To want that office from my faithful hand  Or me to stain thy triumphs with my tears  DUMNORIX  Fear not I tell thee when thou seest my limbs  With dust bespread my brows with glorious sweat  And some distinguish'd wound to grace my breast  Thou in the fulness of thy love shallt view me  And swear I seem most comely in thy fight  Thy virtue then shall shew me worthier of thee  Than did thy fondness on our nuptial day  VENUSIA  It shall be so All wounded thou shalt find  My heart prepar'd to stifle its regret  And smooth my forehead with obedient calmness  Yet hear me further something will I offer  More than the weak effects of female dread  Thou go'st to fight in discord with thy colleague  It is a thought which multiplies my fears  DUMNORIX  Well urg'd thou dearest counsellor who best  Canst heal this mischief Let thy meekness try  The soft persuasion of a private conf'rence  To win from error a bewilder'd sister  While none are present to alarm her pride  VENUSIA  I go but trembling doubt my vain attempt  Unless commissioned with thy dear injunctions  My soul exerted to perform thy pleasure  Could give persuasion all my force of duty  SCENE  the eighth  DUMNORIX EBRANCUS TRINOBANTIANS  and  TENANTIUS  DUMNORIX  Hark we are summon'd  TENANTIUS  Ev'ry band is form'd  The Romans too in close arrangement stand  DUMNORIX  You warriors destin'd to begin the onset  My Trinobantians it is time to seek  Th'embattled foe And you alljudging gods  Look down benignant on a righteous cause  Indeed we cannot give you like the Romans  A proud and sumptuous off'ring we abound not  In marble temples or in splendid altars  Yet though we want this vain luxurious pomp  Rough though we wander on the mountain's head  Through the deep vale and o'er the craggy rock  We still demand your favour we can shew  Hands which for justice draw th'avenging steel  Firm hearts and manners undebas'd by fraud  To you my dauntless friends what need of words  Your cities have been sack'd your children slain  Your wives dishonour'd lo on yonder hills  You see the spoilers there the ruffians stand  Your hands are arm'd then follow and revenge  End of the first Act  ACT II  SCENE  the First  FLAMINIUS  and  AENOBARBUS  FLAMINIUS  HO Aenobarbus thou mayst now come forward  What has thy angry soul been brooding o'er  AENOBARBUS  Well thou hast su'd and hast obtain'd thy suit  Of these Barbarians meanly hast implor'd  Thy wretched life and hast it Must I thank thee  For this uncommon privilege to stand  A tame spectator of the Roman shame  To see exulting savages o'erturn  Our walls and ramparts see them with the spoils  Of our waste dwellings with our captive eagles  And ancient trophies ravish'd from our temples  March in rude triumph o'er the gods of Rome  FLAMINIUS  What thou hadst rather die  AENOBARBUS  And thou hadst rather  Live like a dog in chains than die with courage  Thou most unworthy of the Roman name  FLAMINIUS  Did those who now inhabit Rome deserve  The name of Romans did the ancient spirit  Of our forefathers still survive among us  I should applaud this bold contempt of life  Our ancestors who liv'd while  Rome  was free  Might well prefer a noble fate to chains  They lost a blessing we have never known  Born and inur'd to servitude at home  We only change one master for another  And Dumnorix is far beyond a Nero  AENOBARBUS  Meanst thou to mock me  FLAMINIUS  No I mean to shew  Thy stern opinions suit not with the times  AENOBARBUS  Still by our valour we control the world  And in that duty will I match the foremost  If our forefathers' manners be neglected  Free from that blame I singly will maintain them  My sentiments are moulded by my spirit  Which wants thy pliant qualities to yield  With ev'ry gust of fortune rude or mild  And crouch beneath example base or worthy  FLAMINIUS  Well if thou canst not brook a British master  AENOBARBUS  No nor thy wanton folly will I brook  Which sports alike with slavery or freedom  Insensible of shame  FLAMINIUS  Suppose I free thee  AENOBARBUS  Free me  FLAMINIUS  This day if fortune be propitious  AENOBARBUS  Ha do not cheat me with delusive fables  And trifle with my bonds  FLAMINIUS  By all my hopes  I do not trifle  AENOBARBUS  Willt thou give my bosom  Once more to buckle on the soldier's harness  And meet in battle our insulting foes  Shall my keen falchion gore the flying rout  And raise a bleeding trophy to revenge  For each indignity which Rome hath borne  Hold me no longer in suspence instruct me  From whence these hopes proceed  FLAMINIUS  Thou know'st I lov'd  The British princess  AENOBARBUS  Hast thou rais'd my hopes  To freedom future victory and honour  And dost thou talk of love  FLAMINIUS  That love shall save us  Thou saw'st the gentle Emmeline but now  Stole to our tent and gave her tend'rest welcome  Unchang'd I found her soft and artless still  The gen'rous maid already hath suggested  The means of flight The battle once begun  While ev'ry Briton is intent on war  Herself will guide us to a place of safety  AENOBARBUS  Now I commend thee  FLAMINIUS  Thou approv'st then  AENOBARBUS  Ay  FLAMINIUS  And see the joyful moment is approaching  See where th'unnumber'd Trinobantians spread  In rude disorder o'er the vale beneath  Whose broad extent this eminence commands  Mark their widewaving multitude confus'd  With mingling standards and tumultuous cars  But far superior to the rest behold  The brave and gen'rous Dumnorix erect  With eager hope his lofty jav'lin shakes  And with unpolish'd majesty adorns  The front of war  AENOBARBUS  I mark the rabble well  And soon shall view the Romans from their station  Between those woods which shade the adverse hills  Sweep with resistless ardour to the vale  And trample o'er the savages like dust  FLAMINIUS  That smiling vale with pity I contemplate  And wish more gentle footsteps might be seen  To press its verdure and that softer notes  Than war's terrific clamours might be tun'd  From those surrounding shades to join the murmurs  Of that fair channel whose sonorous bed  Receives the stream descending from this grove  To form the limpid maze which shines below  AENOBARBUS  I see it glist'ning in the noonday sun  But British gore will change its glassy hue  FLAMINIUS  Oh might we rather on its friendly banks  Erect a grateful monument to peace  That she her sway resuming might afford me  To clasp the gallant Dumnorix and stile him  My friend my benefactor and preserver  Stand from before this tempest while it passes  SCENE  the second  BOADICIA ICENIANS AENOBAREUS  and  FLAMINIUS  at a distance  BOADICIA  Oh I could drive this jav'lin thro' my heart  To ease its tortures Disobey'd Controll'd  Ev'n in my army's sight Malignant pow'rs  If such there be who o'er revenge preside  Who steel the breast with everduring hate  And aid black rancour in its purpos'd mischief  Be present now and guide my indignation  pauses  The Trinobantians are advanc'd before me  Let them sustain the onset let the Romans  On Dumnorix with ev'ry cohort press  Till he entreat for Boadicia's aid  Then shall my eager eyes enjoy his ruin  And when th'insulting boaster is o'erthrown  His bands dispers'd or gasping in the dust  Then will I rush exulting in my car  Like fierce Andatè on the weary'd foe  Lead rout and slaughter thro' a tide of gore  Impel my clotted wheels redeem the day  And from the mouth of danger snatching conquest  Crown my revenge with glory  SCENE  the third  BOADICIA ICENIANS AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  at a distance and  VENUSIA  VENUSIA  Stand apart  At my request Icenians▪ O unbend  To  Boad  That louring brow and hear a suppliant sister  So prone to errour is our mortal frame  Time could not step without a trace of horrour  If wary nature on the human heart  Amid its wild variety of passions  Had not impress'd a soft and yielding sense  That when offences give resentment birth  The kindly dews of penitence may raise  The seeds of mutual mercy and forgiveness  BOADICIA  Weak wretch and yet whose impotence aspires  To mix in warlike councils and determine  The fate of captives won in fields of death  Thou wouldst do better to reserve thy tears  Thou shall't have cause for penitential torrents  VENUSIA  They will not wait a second birth of woe  At thy severity they burst already  Why turns on me that formidable aspect  Wont with commanding sternness to behold  Its foes abash'd and victory its vassal  Yet how much brighter is the wreath of glory  When interwove with clemency and justice  Thou go'st to battle there obtain renown  But learn compassion from my tears nor think  Benignity enfeebles or dishonours  The most exalted valour  BOADICIA  Shall the tears  Of abject importunity detain me  While vengeance striding from his grizly den  With fell impatience grinds his iron teeth  And waits my nod to satisfy his hunger  Hence to th' employment of thy feeble distaff  VENUSIA  Not skill'd like thee in war's ennobling toils  Inferiour praise and humbler tasks I court  And own my safety in thy loftier virtues  Yet not like thee with unforgiving wrath  Could I resign a sister to her grief  At this tremendous hour so near deciding  The fate of both One gentle word bestow  And I will leave thee with obedient haste  Nay I will seek the altars and request  That in the future triumphs of this day  Heav'n may refuse to Dumnorix a share  And give thee all  BOADICIA  Does Dumnorix consent  To sacrifice the Romans art thou mute  Still does he brave me but your favour'd captives  Shall not escape They soon shall join the victims  Which this unconquer'd jav'lin shall reserve  To solemnize the fall of Rome's dominion  Then to my glory Dumnorix shall bend  In sight of Britain shall his baffled pride  The pomp of public sacrifice behold  Behold and pine You take a band of soldiers  To an  Icenian  Watch well around the Trinobantian tents  And guard these Romans as your lives I tell thee  To  Venus  Their gore shall yet besmear Andate's altar  VENUSIA  In silent awe I heard thy first resentment  Yet hop'd the well known accents of affection  In kindness whisper'd to thy secret ear  Might to thy breast recal its exil'd pity  That gentle inmate of a woman's heart  BOADICIA  Durst thou presumptuous entertain a thought  To give this bosom nerv'd with manly strength  The weak sensations of a female spirit  VENUSIA  When I remind thy elevated soul  That we by mutual interests are but one  And by th' indissoluble ties of birth  Are those sensations weak which nature prompts  With justice strengthen'd can her pow'rful voice  Find no persuasion  BOADICIA  None Provoke no more  With plaintive murmurs my indignant ear  Thou and thy husband authors of my shame  Before th' assembled chiefs may rest assur'd  No prayers shall soften no attonement bribe  And no submission shall appease the wrong  May desolation trample on my dwelling  A second time rapacious force again  And insult revel through my inmost chambers  If I forgive you Thou hast food for anguish  Go and indulge its appetite at leisure  VENUSIA  Yes I will hasten to the holy shrine  There wring my hands and melt in copious sorrow  Not for my injur'd self but thee remorseless  To mourn thy faded honours which deform'd  By harsh injustice to thy blameless friends  Ne'er will revive in beauty Not success  Not trophies rising round thee not the throng  Of circling captives and their conquer'd standards  Nor glorious dust of victory can hide  From just reproach thy unrelenting scorn  While none deplore thee but the wrong'd Venusia  SCENE  the fourth  BOADICIA ICENIANS AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  at a distance  BOADICIA  Stern pow'r of war my patroness and guide  To thee each captive Roman I devote  Come then vindictive goddess in thy terrours  O'erwhelm with wrath his sacrilegious head  Who would defraud thy altars O confound  His ranks his steeds his chariots and thy favour  To me thy martial votaress confine  In sex like thee and glowing with thy fires  SCENE  the fifth  AENOBARBUS  and  FLAMINIUS  AENOBARBUS  Do thou come forward now and say what terrours  Has thy dejected soul been brooding o'er  Yon furious dame who fill'd thee so with dread  Is marching onward Raise thy head and look  See where ev'n now with sullen pride she mounts  Her martial seat yet wondrous slow by heav'n  Her car descends nor soon will reach the vale  Thou lookst desponding Art thou still dismay'd  Thinkst thou yon dreadful woman will return  From us she moves though slowly then take comfort  FLAMINIUS  Far other cares than terrour fill my breast  AENOBARBUS  What means this languor Wherefore heaves that sigh  FLAMINIUS  O Aenobarbus willt thou bear my weakness  I see the moment of deliv'rance near  Yet pine with grief  AENOBARBUS  Whate'er the folly be  With which thy bosom teems the gods confound it  FLAMINIUS  To see the dearest object of my soul  Just see her after such a tedious absence  Then vanish from her sight perhaps for ever  When these reflections rise the sweet exchange  From bonds to freedom which to her I owe  Is mix'd with bitterness and joy subsides  AENOBARBUS  Why didst thou leave the fair Italian fields  Thou silken slave of Venus what could move  Thee to explore these boist'rous northern climes  And change yon radiant sky for Britain's clouds  What dost thou here effeminate by heav'n  Thou shouldst have loiter'd in Campania's villas  And in thy garden nurs'd with careful hands  The gaudyvested progeny of Flora  Or indolently pac'd the pebbled shore  And ey'd the beating of the Tuscan wave  To waste thy irksome leisure Will't thou tell me  What thou dost here in Britain dost thou come  To sigh and pine could Italy afford  No food for these weak passions must thou traverse  Such tracts of land and visit this cold region  To love and languish answer me what motive  First brought thee hither but forbear to urge  It was in quest of honour for the god  Of war disclaims thee  FLAMINIUS  Well suppose I answer  That friendship drew me from the golden Tiber  With thee to combat this inclement sky  Will it offend thee  AENOBARBUS  No I am thy friend  And I will make a Roman of thee still  But let me see no languishing dejection  More on thy brow nor hear unmanly sighs  Gods can'st thou dream of love When yonder s  e  The Roman legions all array'd for battle  Are now descending see their dreaded eagles  Their dazzling helmets and their crimson plumes  A grove of jav'lins glitters down the steep  They point their terrours on th' astonish'd foe  Soon will they charge the Britons in the vale  And with th' auspicious glories of this day  Enrich the annals of imperial Rome  O curst captivity with double weight  I feel thee now malicious fate to suffer  A Roman thus to stand confin'd in bondage  And see the triumphs which he cannot share  By heav'n Flaminius I will never bear it  Where is thy Briton Will she lead us hence  Else by the god of war unarm'd I rush  To join the glorious scene which opens there  FLAMINIUS  I see her coming and will fly to meet her  AENOBARBUS  Our time is short remember do not dally  SCENE  the sixth  AENOBARBUS  I have a thought lyes rip'ning in my breast  And teems with future glory if the fight  Prove undecisive and these tents subsist  Soon will I bid thee hostile camp farewell  Thou saw'st me come in thraldom I depart  A fugitive if ever I return  Thou shallt receive me in another guise  Then shallt thou feel me when my shining helm  Shall strike cold terrour through thy boldest guards  And from its lofty crest destruction shake  End of the second Act  ACT III  SCENE  the first  FLAMINIUS  and  AENOBARBUS  FLAMINIUS  OUR lovely guide attends us Thy impatience  Hath call'd me loit'rer  AENOBARBUS  Thou mayst loiter still  Thou canst not hasten nor retard our fate  Which is irrevocably fix'd  FLAMINIUS  What say'st thou  AENOBARBUS  I say prepare to die If Boadicia  Return once more our destiny is fix'd  Whate'er her merciless revenge may purpose  Elate with conquest or incens'd by loss  If on the rack to strain our bursting sinews  If from the bleeding trunks to lop our lim  s  Or with slow fires protract the hours of pain  We must abide it all Collect thy spirit  And like a Roman dauntless wait thy doom  FLAMINIUS  I hear thee but thy meaning  AENOBARBUS  Hear again  Before the tent some paces as I stood  And joyful saw the Trinobantian guard  Of us neglectful from this quarter drawn  To view th'impending battle on a sudden  A curs'd Icenian cast his jealous eye  Athwart my steps then call'd a num'rous band  Who prowl around us as a destin'd prey  FLAMINIUS  Malicious fortune  AENOBARBUS  Now thou seest my meaning  FLAMINIUS  Our flight were vain while these observe us  AENOBARBUS  True  What has thy tame submission now avail'd  Thy abject supplication to barbarians  Hadst thou with courage met thy fate at first  We had been dead ere now  FLAMINIUS  To view the sun  Thro' his gay progress from the morn till even▪  Possess my friends my parents and my love  Within the circle of my native walls  Were joys I deem'd well worthy of my care  But since that care is fruitless I can leave  This light my friends my parents love and country  As little daunted at my fate as thou  Tho' not so unconcern'd  AENOBARBUS  O Mars and Vesta  Is it a vision which you raise before me  To charm my eyes Behold a scene Flaminius  To cheer a Roman in the gasp of death  The Britons are defeated look Flaminius  Back from the vale in wild tumultuous flight  Behold their numbers sweeping tow'rd the hill  Already some are swarming up its side  To reach their camp for shelter pale dismay  With hostile rage pursue their broken rear  While massacre unchidden cloys his famine  And quaffs the blood of nations O in vain  Dost thou oppose thy bosom to the tide  Of war and brandish that recover'd standard  Vain is thy animating voice to those  Whom fear makes deaf O Dumnorix thy toils  Are fruitless Britain in the scale of fate  Yields to the weight of Rome Now life farewell  Shine on bright Phoebus those who rest behind  To share thy splendours while I sink in darkness  Are far beneath my envy I resign  These eyes with pleasure to eternal shades  They now have seen enough  FLAMINIUS  Whence this despair  A blind confusion fills the spacious camp  Already consternation hath dispers'd  Our guard Ev'n Dumnorix retiresHe comes  Avoid himTrust me I am well instructed  And will conduct thee to a safe retreat  SCENE  the second  DUMNORIX  with a standard  Thou hardkept remnant of our shatter'd fortune  Stand there before the partial eye of heav'n  Which has preferr'd the Romans' splendid altars  To the plain virtue of a British heart  Presumptuous frenzy Why is heav'n reproach'd  O Boadicia thou perfidious mischief  SCENE  the third  DUMNORIX  and  VENUSIA  VENUSIA  Now let my duty o'er my fear prevail  Fill my whole breast with tenderness and heal  With sweetest comfort thy distress  DUMNORIX  My wife  Thou most unlike to you degen'rate woman  Her country's bane  VENUSIA  I tremble at thy words  DUMNORIX  Be not dismay'd the camp is still our own  Night is impending and the Romans halt  VENUSIA  But what of Boadicia  DUMNORIX  Hear and mourn  The Trinobantians scarce had fill'd the vale  When from a narrow pass between the woods  Forth burst the Romans wedg'd in deep array  I found our struggle vain and sent for aid  To Boadicia she with scorn reply'd  I did not want th' assistance of a woman  Nor left her station till my broken ranks  Were driv'n among th' Icenians in a moment  All was confusion slaughter and defeat  SCENE  the fourth  DUMNORIX VENUSIA  and  BOADICIA  DUMNORIX  Gods art thou safe  VENUSIA  Oh most unhappy sister  When last we parted cruel were thy words  A sure presage of endless grief to me  Yet my desponding spirit ne'er foreboded  That thou couldst deviate from a prosp'rous course  When ev'ry gale conspir'd to swell thy glory  BOADICIA  Throw not on me the crime of envious fortune  DUMNORIX  Dost thou blame fortune traitress  BOADICIA  Then the blame  Take on thy single head  DUMNORIX  Avoid my sight  BOADICIA  Thou ledst the van  DUMNORIX  Avaunt  BOADICIA  Thou fledst the first  Now findst too late th'importance of a woman  DUMNORIX  Too true I find a woman curs'd with pow'r  To blast a nation's welfare Heavenly rulers  How have the Britons merited this shame  Have we with fell ambition like the Romans  Unpeopled realms and made the world a desart  Have we your works defac'd or how deserv'd  So large a measure of your bitt'rest wrath  That you should cloath this spirit of a wolf  In human form and blend her lot with ours  BOADICIA  Beset with perils as I am pursu'd  By rout and havoc to th'encirc'ling toyl  Untam'd by this reverse my lofty soul  Upbraiding still thy arrogance demands  Who spar'd the captive Romans Who provok'd  My just resentment Who in pow'r in name  And dignity inferior but elate  With blind presumption and by envy stung  Dar'd to dispute with me supreme command  Then pale and trembling turn'd his back on danger  VENUSIA  O once united by the friendliest ties  And leaders both of nations shall this land  Still view its bulwarks tott'ring with disunion  Enhance the public and their own misfortunes  Thou my complacent lord wert wont to smooth  That manly front at pity's just complaint  And thou entrusted with a people's welfare  A queen and warrior let disdain no more  Live in the midst of dangersee Venusia  Upon her knees  DUMNORIX  Shall thy perfections kneel  To this  VENUSIA  Oh stop nor give resentment utt'rance  In such a cause the proudest knee might sue  To less than BoadiciaTurn not from me  To  Boadicia  Look on a prostrate sister Think thou hear'st  Our children's plaintive notes enforce my pray'r  And Albion's genius mix his solemn moan  That lamentations through thy ears resound  From all the wives and mothers of those thousands  Whose limbs lie stretch'd on yonder fields of death  Those wretched wives and mothers oh reflect  But for the fatal discord of this day  With other looks with other cries and gestures  With diff  rent transports and with diff'rent tears  Might have receiv'd their sons and husbands home  Than they will now survey their pale remains  Which there lye mangled by the Roman sword  To feed the raven's hungeryet relent  Yet let restoring union close our wounds  And to repair this ruin be thy praise  DUMNORIX  Rise rise Thy mildness whose persuasive charm  No cruelty but hers could hear unmov'd  In vain would render placable and wise  That malice inhumanity and frenzy  Which have already wasted such a store  Of glory and success  BOADICIA  Oh  DUMNORIX  Dost thou groan  BOADICIA  No no I do not feel a moment's pain  DUMNORIX  Thy words are false Thy heart o'erflows with anguish  BOADICIA  No I despise both thee and fortune still  DUMNORIX  By heav'n I know distraction rends thy soul  And to its view presents th' approaching scene  Of shame and torture when th' indignant Romans  Exact a tenfold vengeance for their suff'rings  And when thou passest through their streets in chains  The just derision of insulting foes  A frantic woman who resign'd her hopes  And to indulge an empty pride betray'd  Her children friends and country then recal  What once was Boadicia fall'n how low  From all her honours by her folly fall'n  From pow'r from empire victory and glory  To vilest bonds and ignominious stripes  BOADICIA  May curses blast thee worse than I can utter  And keener pangs than whips or shackles seize thee  VENUSIA  Oh sister how unseemly is this rage  Whom dost thou load with these ungen'rous curses  Thy faithful friend thy counsellour and brother  Whom thou hast injur'd injur'd past the pow'r  Of reparation Dost thou call for whips  To print those venerable limbs with shame  For bonds to humble that majestic head  Which foes themselves must honour yet if chains  Must be our fate what cruel hand hath forg'd them  But thine alone thy hand hath heap'd destruction  On him thy once rever'd ally on me  On my poor children guiltless of offence  And on thy own who claim'd protection ftom thee  Yet thou obdurate to thy rage a prey  Dost chide remorse and pity from thy breast  DUMNORIX  to  BOADICIA  Source of thy own afflictions to behold thee  Distracted thus thus fall'n and lost to see  Thus strongly painted on thy lab'ring features  The pangs thou feel'st within awakes compassion  BOADICIA  Ha nodivine Andate shall uphold me  Above thy pity Think'st thou Boadicia  Is thus deserted by her patron goddess  Thus void of all resources think so still  And be deceiv'd Ev'n now I feel her aid  aside  I feel her  ere the warlike queen inspires  My pregnant soul the mighty plan is forming  It grows it labours in my ardent bosom  It springs to life and calls for instant action  Lead on exert thee goddess till the furies  Which heretofore have thunder'd at thy heels  Start at the newborn horrours of this night  SCENE  the fifth  DUMNORIX  and  VENUSIA  VENUSIA  Oh Dumnorix how virtue hath recoil'd  Upon itself my interposing pity  Thy manly firmness in a gen'rous act  Gave these disasters being  DUMNORIX  I forbid thee  To blame thy virtues which the gods approve  And I revere Now leave me to conce  t  With our surviving chiefs the means of safety  VENUSIA  Oh that like me compliant at thy word  Peace a benign companion would attend  And moderate thy cares while I depart  SCENE  the sixth  DUMNORIX  Have I been guilty answer me my heart  Who now wouldst burst my agonizing breast  Hath Dumnorix been guilty willt thou Britain  To me impute the horrours of this day  Perhaps a Roman's policy had yielded  And to a colleague's cruelty and pride  Had sacrific'd humanity and justice  I did not so and Albion is destroy'd  Yet O be witness all ye gen'rous spirits  So lately breathing in those heaps of death  That in this day's extremity and peril  Your Dumnorix was mindful of his charge  My shiver'd javelin my divided shield  And blunted sword be witness for your master  You were not idle in that dreadful hour  Nor ev'n amid the carnage pil'd around me  Will I relinquish my pursuit of hope  Hope may forsake meFor myself I fear not  But my VenusiaHa prepare my soul  There is thy struggle on her tender mind  To graft thy firmness which can welcome death  And hold it gain when liberty is lost  End of the third Act  ACT IV  SCENE  the First  DUMNORIX  TILL good Tenantius and the rest return  I have been led by solitary care  To you dark branches spreading o'er the brook  Which murmurs through the camp this mighty camp  Where once two hundred thousand sons of war  With restless dins awak'd the midnight hour  Now horrid stillness in the vacant tents  Sits undisturb'd and these incessant rills  Whose pebbled channel breaks their shallow stream  Fill with their melancholly sound my ears  As if I wander'd like a lonely hind  O'er some dead fallow far from all resort  Unless that ever and anon a groan  Bursts from a soldier pillow'd on his shield  In torment or expiring with his wounds  And turns my fix'd attention into horrour  Venusia comesThe hideous scene around me  Now prompts the hard but necessary duty  Yet how to name thee death without thy terrours  SCENE  the second  DUMNORIX  and  VENUSIA  VENUSIA  Thou didst enjoin my absence I departed  With illtim'd care if now returning  DUMNORIX  No  VENUSIA  Alas deepplung'd in sadness still I find thee  DUMNORIX  Dost thou come nearer Thou hast seen this day  How thy perfidious thy invet'rate sister  Hath stain'd my glory and my fortune baffled  Thou hast received me vanquish'd who before  Was us'd to greet thee with the sound of conquest  Now tell me truly am I still the same  In my Venusia's eyes  VENUSIA  What means my lord  DUMNORIX  Am I still lov'd and honour'd as before  VENUSIA  Canst thou suspect that fortune rules my love  Thy pow'r and honours may be snatch'd away  Thy wide possessions pass to other lords  And frowning heav'n resume whate'er it gave  All but my love which ne'er shall know decay  But ev'n in ruin shall augment its fondness  DUMNORIX  Then will my dictates be regarded still  VENUSIA  Impart this moment thy rever'd commands  And if it prove within my slender pow'r  To ease thy troubles I will bless the gods  And unrepining to our fate submit  DUMNORIX  Think not my own calamities distress me  I can encounter fortune's keenest malice  But oh for thee Venusia  VENUSIA  Do not fear  While in these faithful arms I hold my lord  I never shall complain Let ev'ry ill  Let ruin and captivity oe'rtake me  With thee I will be happy  DUMNORIX  Ha Venusia  Could thou and I find happiness together  Depriv'd of freedom Dost thou mark  VENUSIA  I do  DUMNORIX  Thou art most fair but could thy lovely face  Make slavery look comely Could the touch  Of that soft hand convey delight to mine  With servile fetters on  VENUSIA  Why dost thou gaze  So stedfastly upon me  DUMNORIX  I would have thee  Reflect once more upon the loss of freedom  VENUSIA  It is the heaviest sure of human woes  DUMNORIX  Learn one thing more and though relentless heav'n  Its care withdraws from this illdestin'd isle  Thou in the fall of nations shallt be safe  Oh heed Venusia never did thy welfare  Raise in my breast such tender cares before  Else from the public danger would I spare  These precious moments to assist thy virtue  VENUSIA  Thou mak'st me all attention  DUMNORIX  Reach thy hand  Now while I hold thee do I bless Andate  That this free hand protected by my sword  Hath not yet known the shameful doom of bondage  VENUSIA  Nor shall I know it thy unshaken valour  Will be my safeguard still  DUMNORIX  If fate confounds  My utmost efforts can I then protect thee  VENUSIA  Why dost thou lead me to despair Why fill  My breast with terrours Never did I see thee  Till this sad hour thus hopeless and dejected  Oh how shall I a woman weak and fearful  Sustain my portion of the gen'ral woe  If thou in perils exercis'd and war  Dost to ill fortune bow thy gallant spirit  DUMNORIX  Think not Venusia I abandon hope  No on the verge of ruin will I stand  And dauntless combat with our evil fate  Nor till its rancour bear me to the bottom  My soul shall ever entertain despair  But as the wisest and the best resolv'd  Cannot controll the doubtful chance of war  I would prepare thee for the worst event  VENUSIA  Fly where thou willt my faithful steps shall follow  I can pursue thy course with naked feet  Though roaming o'er the rough and pointed crags  Or through the pathless tract of deepest woods  By thy dear hand supported would Ipass  Through the cold snow which hides the mountain's brow  And o'er the frozen surface of the vale  DUMNORIX  Thou best of women I believe thou wouldst  Believe thy constant heart would teach those limbs  Thus soft and gentle to support all hardship  And hold with me society in toil  But should we want the wretched pow'r to fly  What then  VENUSIA  What then  DUMNORIX  The Romans may surround us  VENUSIA  How wouldst thou act in such a dreadful season  DUMNORIX  Ne'er shall the hands of Dumnorix endure  The shame of fetters ne'er shall Rome behold  This breast which honourable war hath seam'd  Pant with the load of bondage gen'rous wounds  Ye deep engraven characters of glory  Ye faithful monitors of Albion's cause  Oft when you midnight anguish hath rebuk'd  Oblivious slumber from my watchful pillow  And in her danger kept my virtue waking  You when that office can avail no more  Will look more graceful on my deathcold bosom  Than to be shewn before the scoffing Romans  Should they behold that Dumnorix in shackles  Whom once they dreaded on the field of war  VENUSIA  Assist me heav'n  DUMNORIX  Speak out I watch to hear thee  My pow'rs are all suspended with attention  VENUSIA  What shall I do  DUMNORIX  Explain thy thoughts  VENUSIA  I cannot  DUMNORIX  Why canst thou not Remember who thou art  And who thy husband is  VENUSIA  The first of men  Join'd to the least deserving of her sex  DUMNORIX  View thy own heart be conscious of thy merit  And in its strength confiding be secure  That thou art worthy of the greatest man  And not unequal to the noblest task  VENUSIA  O I will struggle to assist that claim  Yet dearest lord extend thy whole indulgence  Nor undeserving of thy love esteem me  While trembling thus  DUMNORIX  I know thy native softness  Yet wherefore dost thou tremble Speak my love  VENUSIA  O I have not thy courage not been us'd  Like thee to meet the dreadful shape of death  I never felt the anguish of a wound  Thy arm hath still kept danger at a distance  If now it threatens and my heart no more  Must treat with safety it is new to me  DUMNORIX  It is my love My tenderness implies  No expectation that thy gentle mind  Should be at once familiariz'd with fate  Not insurmountable I hold our danger  But to provide against delusive fortune  That thou mayst bear unterrify'd the lot  Which best shall suit thy dignity and name  Demands thy care take counsel of thy virtue  VENUSIA  I will  DUMNORIX  And arm thy breast with resolution  VENUSIA  Indeed I will and ask the gracious gods  To fill my heart with constancy and spirit  And shew me worthy of a man like thee  Perhaps their succour thy rever'd injunction  And high example may controll my terrours  But oh what pow'r shall sooth another care  Than life more precious and a keener pang  Than death's severest agony relieve  The sad remembance of my helpless infants  Our love's dear pledges who before me rise  In orphan woe defenceless and forsaken  And all my borrow'd fortitude dissolve  DUMNORIX  Thou perfect pattern of maternal fondness  And conjugal compliance rest assur'd  That care was never absent from my soul  Confide in me thy children shall be safe  VENUSIA  How safe  DUMNORIX  Shall live in safety Thou shallt know  Mean time retire Our anxious chiefs return'd  Wait my commands and midnight is advancing  SCENE  the third  DUMNORIX  She goesher love and duty will surmount  This hideous TaskO morning bright in hope  Clos'd by a night of horrour which reduces  This poordear woman yet in blooming years  Bless'd in her husband in her offspring bless'd  Perhaps to cut her stem of being short  With her own tender handIf ever tears  Might sort with valour nor debase a soldier  It would be nowHa whither do I plunge  SCENE  the Fourth  DUMNORIX EBRANCUS TENANTIUS  and  TRINOBANTIANS  DUMNORIX  Well my brave friends what tidings  EBRANCUS  Through thy quarter  With weary steps and mourning have we travers'd  A silent desart of unpeopled tents  Quite to the distant station of th' Icenians  Their chiefs we found in council round their queen  The multitude was arming twenty thousand  Were yet remaining and unhurt by war  Unlike our Trinobantians who unaided  The fatal onset bore Those huge battalions  Which Rome so dreaded are alas no more  DUMNORIX  Be not dejected Far the greater part  Are fled for shelter to their native roofs  And will rejoin us when with force repair'd  We may dispute our island still with Rome  But have you gain'd access to Boadicia  EBRANCUS  We have  DUMNORIX  What said she  EBRANCUS  She approv'd thy counsel  DUMNORIX  You told her then my purpose to retreat  Through yonder forest  EBRANCUS  To herself alone  We told it  DUMNORIX  I commend you You have sav'd us  A conference both needless and unpleasing  EBRANCUS  She further bade us note how all th' Icenians  Were then in arms and ready to advance  DUMNORIX  Return and tell her let thy phrase Ebrancus  Be soft and humble e're two hours be wasted  We must begin our march Do you explore  To the other  Trinobantians  The secret passage and with winged haste  Bring back your tidings Thou Tenantius wait  SCENE  the fifth  DUMNORIX  and  TENANTIUS  DUMNORIX  To thee my inmost bosom I must open  And to thy friendship trust my tend'rest cares  Thou must pursue thy journey heed me well  Quite through the forestDost thou know the pass  TENANTIUS  Yes where those gushing waters leave the grove  To seek the valley deeper in the shade  From the same fountain flows a smaller brook  Whose secret channel through the thicket winds  And will conduct me farther down the v  le  DUMNORIX  Which once attain'd proceed and gain my dwelling  Give me thy honest handCome nearer soldier  Thy faithful bosom would I clasp to mine  Perhaps thy general and thou may never  Embrace again  TENANTIUS  What means my fearless chief  Why hast thou call'd this unaccustom'd moisture  Into thy soldier's eyes  DUMNORIX  Thou dost not weep  My gallant vet'ranI have been to blame  A tenderness resulting from a care  Which struggles here subdu'd me for a moment  This shall be soon discharg'd and all be well  I have two boysIf after all my efforts  I speak not prompted by despair but caution  Rome should prevail against me and our hopes  Abortive fall thou take these helpless infants  With thee transport them to our northern frontier  And hide them deep in Caledonian woods  There in their growing years excite and cherish  The dear remembrance of their native fields  That to redeem them from th' Italian spoiler  If e'er some kind occasion should invite  Forth from their covert they may spring undaunted  Ne'er let the race of Dumnorix divert  One thought from Albion to their own repose  Remind them often of their father's toils  Whom thou leav'st grappling to the last with fortune  And if beneath this island's mould'ring state  I to avoid disgraceful chains must sink  Fain would my spirit in the hope depart  That on the ruins which surround my fall  A new born structure may hereafter stand  Rais'd by my virtue living in my sons  End of th  fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE  the First  VENUSIA  A Hollow sound of tumult strikes my ear  Perhaps the howl of some nightroaming wolves  Who wak'd by hunger from their gloomy haunts  Are trooping forth to make their fell repast  On my freshbleeding countrymen whose limbs  O'erspread the valley Shall I mourn your fall  Lost friends who couch'd in death forget your cares  I who may shortly join your ghastly band  Unless that forest yield its friendly aid  O hope sweet flatt'rer whose delusive touch  Sheds on afflicted minds the balm of comfort  Relieves the load of poverty sustains  The captive bending with the weight of bonds  And smooths the pillow of disease and pain  Send back th' exploring messenger with joy  And let me hail thee from that friendly grove  SCENE  the second  VENUSIA  and  DUMNORIX  DUMNORIX  Why hast thou left thy couch  VENUSIA  I heard a sound  Like tumult at a distance  DUMNORIX  So did I  As near the op'ning pass I stood to watch  Our messenger's return  SCENE  the third  VENUSIA DUMNORIX  and  EBRANCUS  DUMNORIX  to  EBRANCUS  What means this haste  Why lookst thou pale  EBRANCUS  With thy instructions charg'd  I sought th'Icenian quarter All around  Was solitude and silence When I call'd  No voice reply'd To Boadicia's tent  With fearful haste I trod Her daughters there  I found in consternation I enquir'd  The cause they answer'd only with their tears  Till from the princess Emmeline at last  I learn'd that all th' Icenians were that hour  In silent march departed but their course  She could not tell me that her furious mother  Had with a fell determin'd look enjoin'd them  To wait her pleasure which should soon be known  Mean time to rest immoveable and mute  SCENE  the fourth  VENUSIA DUMNORIX EBRANCUS  and an  ICENIAN  carrying a bowl  VENUSIA  My Dumnorix defend me  DUMNORIX  Ha what means  This wild demeanourwillt thou speak Icenian  Fear not my love thy Dumnorix is near  What is that bowl thou carry'st  ICENIAN  If ought appears disorder'd in my gesture  Which ill becomes the reverence I owe thee  Charge that demerit to my horrid errand  And not to me  VENUSIA  What will befal us now  DUMNORIX  to the  ICENIAN  Willt thou begin  ICENIAN  I come from Boadicia  DUMNORIX  Where is she  ICENIAN  Far advanc'd o'er yonder vale  DUMNORIX  With what intention  ICENIAN  To assail the Romans  DUMNORIX  Assail the Romans  ICENIAN  To surprize their camp  At this dead hour with unexpected slaughter  Before she march'd to me this secret charge  In words like these she gave "Observe our course  "When I have pass'd the camp's extremest verge  "Back to my daughters and Venusia speed  "Tell them I go our fortune to restore  "If unsuccessful never to return  "Should that stern doom attend me bid them take  "The last best gift which dying I can leave them  "That of my blood no part may prove dishonour'd  "The Trinobantian of his Roman friends  "So well deserving may accept their grace"  This said with wild emotion in her breast  Her visage black'ning with despair and horrour  She streight committed to my trembling hands  Two fatal bowls which flow with poison'd streams  I have acc  mplish'd half my horrid task  With Boadicia's daughters  DUMNORIX  Frantic woman  Who hopes with fury and despair to match  The vigilance and conduct of Suetonius  ICENIAN  From this illfated hand receive the draught  Whose hue and odour warrant it the juice  Of that benumbing plant the Druids gather  That plant whose drowsy moisture lulls the sense  And with a silent influence expels  The unresisting spirit from her seat  DUMNORIX  Mistaken woman did she deem Venusia  Was unprovided of this friendly potion  Perfo  m thy orders bear it to my tent  Thou mayst not want it yettake comfort love  SCENE  the fifth  VENUSIA DUMNORIX EBRANCUS  and a second  ICENIAN  Second  ICENIAN  Oh Dumnorix  DUMNORIX  Icenian spare thy voice  Thy flight thy terrour and thy wounds interpret  Too plainly  Second  ICENIAN  We are vanquish'd  DUMNORIX  I believe thee  Second  ICENIAN  Oh I have much to tell theebut I faint  DUMNORIX  to  EBRANCUS  Conduct him hence and learn the whole event  SCENE  the sixth  VENUSIA  and  DUMNORIX  VENUSIA  On you celestial arbiters we call  Now as we stand environ'd by distress  Now weigh our actions past deform'd or fair  If e'er oppression hath defil'd his valour  In help and pity to the woes of others  Our hearts been scanty and our hands reserv'd  Let our transgressions ratify our doom  Else with your justice let our merits plead  To hold its shield before us and repel  These undeserv'd misfortunes  DUMNORIX  Heav'n may hear  And through that forest lead us still to safety  Ha no each pow'r against us is combin'd  What but their anger levell'd at our heads  Could bring Tenantius back so strictly charg'd  To seek our homeThe intercepting foes  Have seiz'd the secret pass  VENUSIA  Whose guardian care  Now to the gloomy shelter of a desart  To solitary innocence and peace  Will guide our friendless orphans  DUMNORIX  True Venusia  Through ev'ry trial heav'n is pleas'd to lead us  Droop notone comfort never can forsake us  The mind to virtue train'd in ev'ry state  Rejoicing grieving dying must possess  Th'exalted pleasure to exert that virtue  SCENE  the seventh  VENUSIA DUMNORIX  and  TENANTIUS  VENUSIA  Speak speak Tenantius  TENANTIUS  We pursu'd our course  But had not travell'd far before we heard  The sound of footsteps dashing through the brook  Whose winding channel marks the secret way  Not long we stood in wonder ere a troop  Of Romans sally'd forth and made us captives  DUMNORIX  Why then farewell to what was left of hope  TENANTIUS  Not so my lord  VENUSIA  Speak what resource is left  TENANTIUS  We were conducted to the Roman leaders  One fierce and haughty gentler far the other  Who calm'd his stern companion gave us comfort  Nam'd thee with rev'rence then an earnest zeal  Disclosing for thy safety and requesting  A short but friendly conference between you  With courtesy dismiss'd us  VENUSIA  Is he near  TENANTIUS  Hard by he waits impatient for an answer  Just where the pass is open to the tent  DUMNORIX  What would the Roman  VENUSIA  Hasten back Tenantius  And say that Dumnorix consents to parley  DUMNORIX  Ha trust our freedom in a Roman's pow'r  TENANTIUS  Unarm'd and single will the Roman join thee  DUMNORIX  O ineffectual effort  VENUSIA  Only see him  If but to parley for thy children's safety  Weak as I am unequal to these conflicts  I would embrace destruction ere request thee  Once to comply with ought below thy greatness  DUMNORIX  Let him approach  SCENE  the eighth  VENUSIA DUMNORIX  and  EBRANCUS  DUMNORIX  What hast thou learnt my soldier  EBRANCUS  Like ours th'Icenian force is all destroy'd  DUMNORIX  And Boadicia  EBRANCUS  Nought of her I know  But that she found the Roman host embattled  Which she had fondly deem'd immers'd in sleep  DUMNORIX  And so is fall'n a victim to her folly  Retire  SCENE  the ninth  VENUSIA DUMNORIX TENANTIUS  and  FLAMINIUS  TENANTIUS  to  FLAMINIUS  Thy helmet cast aside restores thee  To my remembrance Lo thy benefactors  FLAMINIUS  Brave Dumnorix  DUMNORIX  My captive  FLAMINIUS  Yes Flaminius  Who owes to thy humanity his life  DUMNORIX  Where hast thou hid thee from my notice rather  Whence now return'st ennobled with command  No more in thraldom but a Roman leader  FLAMINIUS  Amid the tumult of your late defeat  We sought th'adjacent forest thence we pass'd  The vale below and reach'd the Roman tents  DUMNORIX  And now are masters o our late retreat  Had I been cruel Britain had been safe  FLAMINIUS  Was this an act unworthy of a soldier  DUMNORIX  Our woes are all the progeny of folly  Not charg'd to thee or fortune  VENUSIA  Heav'n well pleas'd  Perhaps ordain'd this unforeseen event  That our benevolence to brave Flaminius  Its due return of gratitude should find  FLAMINIUS  The life you gave me to your mutual welfare  I here devote My influence my pow'r  My thoughts my care to soften your afflictions  Shall all combine Surrender to your friend  Before Suetonius with his legions pours  On your defenceless camp who long in arms  Hath stood expecting the appointed signal  Which he enjoin'd us with the dawn to rear  DUMNORIX  Though thou didst well accepting life from me  That gift from thee must Dumnorix refuse  FLAMINIUS  Thou willt not rob my gratitude of pow'r  To shew how well thy goodness was bestow'd  DUMNORIX  Thou canst not shew it If thou sav'st my life  Canst thou from bonds protect me and a triumph  FLAMINIUS  Alas I cannot  DUMNORIX  Wouldst thou see me led  A sullen captive and through haughty Rome  Inglorious count my paces to the clink  Of my own chains this faithful woman too  VENUSIA  Like thee disdains a being so preserv'd  FLAMINIUS  O let me water with my tears your feet  If ev'ry drop which issues from my heart  Could from the doom you justly scorn secure you  Before you now the purple sluice should open  Yet let my knees in humblest adoration  Before such elevated virtue bend  O godlike Britons my acknowledg'd patrons  And benefactors if my soul retain not  Your memory for ever dear and sacred  May disappointment poverty and shame  Deform my life and pining sickness close  My youthful eyes untimely in the grave  DUMNORIX  Thou seem'st of all the Romans to possess  A heart which feels for others Rise and hear  Though we reject the wretched boon of life  Thou may'st Flaminius yet repay our bounty  FLAMINIUS  Then will I ask no other grace from heav'n  DUMNORIX  We have two children  VENUSIA  O my bleeding heart  My poor deserted infants whom these arms  No more must cherish nor my lulling voice  Hush in the quiet of my sheltring bosom  DUMNORIX  aside  Yet shall not this unman me I will feel  A father's anguish but conceal the pain  To  Flam  Know then I meant this faithful friend Tenantius  Should traverse yonder wood and bear my sons  Far from these borders to extremest north  Where they might dwell secure nor share the ills  Doom'd to their parents Willt thou let him pass  FLAMINIUS  I will and Jove be witness to my word  DUMNORIX  Give thy last charge Venusia to Tenantius  One word apart with thee my Roman friend  As thou art gen'rous answer me with truth  When willt thou make thy signal  FLAMINIUS  At the dawn  Whose beams though faint already tinge the east  DUMNORIX  What time will bring your legions near this tent  FLAMINIUS  An hour at farthest  DUMNORIX  I have heard Flaminius  Of your forefather's spirit how they fell  Oft on their swords to shun ignoble bondage  This part have we to act and friendly Roman  When thou shallt see our cold remainsmy own  Are little worth attentionOh remember  Venusia's goodness and her gentle clay  Defend from shame and insult  FLAMINIUS  Thou dost pierce  My heartI cannot answerbut believe  These tears sincere  DUMNORIX  Enough Perform thy promise  Thy obligations will be then discharg'd  Farewell Fulfill thy gen'ral's commands  SCENE  the tenth  VENUSIA DUMNORIX  and  TENANTIUS  VENUSIA  to  TENANTIUS  Thou future parent of my orphan babes  Soon as their gen'rous minds imbibe thy precepts  And thy example warms their budding virtues  Do not forget to tell them that no perils  Nor death in all its terrous can efface  Maternal love that their illfated mother  Amid this awful season of distress  Wept but for them and lost her fears in fondness  DUMNORIX  We have been long companions brave Tenantius  Thy leader I once fortunate and great  And thou my faithful and intrepid soldier  Nay do not weepwe have not time for wailing  By thy approv'd fidelity and love  Thy chief just ent'ring death's unfolded gates  Stops and once more conjures thee to retain  This his last charge in memoryhis children  SCENE  the eleventh  VENUSIA  and  DUMNORIX  DUMNORIX  The sun is ris'n All hail thou last of days  To this nighfinish'd being Radiant pow'r  Thou through thy endless journey mayst proclaim  That Dumnorix dy'd free for thou shallt view it  Behold th' appointed signal from the grove  Just as Flaminius warn'd us is appear'd  To call Suetonius and his legions on  Come desolation tyranny resort  To thy new seat come slavery and bend  The neck of Albion all her sons debase  And ancient virtue from their hearts expel  Now then ye honour'd mansions of our fathers  Ye hallow'd altars and ye awful groves  The habitation of our gods farewell  And yet the guilty auth'ress of these woes  Deserves a share of praise who still retaining  One unextinguish'd spark of gen'rous honour  Scorn'd to remain spectatress or partaker  Of Albion's fall and dying still is free  Need I say more Venusia  VENUSIA  Oh my lord  DUMNORIX  Why heaves that sigh  VENUSIA  Alas I am a woman  DUMNORIX  True a defenceless woman and expos'd  To keener sorrow by thy matchless beauty  That charm which captivates the victor's eye  Yet helpless to withstand his savage force  Throws wretched woman under double ruin  But wherefore this Thy virtue knows its duty  VENUSIA  Stay but a little  DUMNORIX  aside  Would I might for years  But die that thoughtFalse tenderness away  Thou British genius who art now retiring  From this lost region yet suspend thy flight  And in this conflict lend me all thy spirit  We only ask thee to be free and die  Well my Venusia is thy soul resolv'd  Or shall I still afford a longer pause  VENUSIA  Though my weak sex by nature is not arm'd  With fortitude▪ like thine of this be sure  That dear subjection to thy honour'd will  Which hath my life directed ev'n in death  Shall not forsake me and thy faithful wife  Shall with obedience meet thy last commands  But canst thou tell me is it hard to die  DUMNORIX  Oh rather ask me if to live in shame  Captivity and sorrow be not hard  VENUSIA  Oh miserable  DUMNORIX  In a foreign land  The painful toils of servitude to bear  From an imperious mistress  VENUSIA  Dreadful thought  DUMNORIX  Or be insulted with the hateful love  Of some proud master  VENUSIA  Oh proceed  No further  DUMNORIX  From thy native seat of dwelling  From all the known endearments of thy home  From parents children friends andhusband torn  VENUSIA  Stop there and reach the potion nor to drink  The cure of troubles will I longer pause  SCENE  the twelfth  VENUSIA  For ev'ry pass'd possession of delight  Both in my offspring and their godlike sire  A dying matron bends her grateful knee  Ye all disposing pow'rs as now these blessings  Must reach their period to my sons transfer  That copious goodness I have shar'd so long  Through my resigning soul that promise breathe  And my last moments comfort thus with peace  SCENE  the thirteenth  VENUSIA  and  DUMNORIX  with a bowl  DUMNORIX  aside seeing  Venusia  on her knees  Now resolution now be doubly arm'd  He gives her the bowl and she drinks  Now stand awhile before the fanning breeze  So with its subtle energy the potion  Less rudely stealing on the pow'rs of life  Will best perform its office to remove  Pain fear and grief for ever from thy breast  How dost thou fare Venusia  VENUSIA  I perceive  No alteration Every sense remains  Yet unimpair'd Then while these moments last  Let me on thee direct my eyes to gaze  While unobstructed still their sight endures  Let me receive thee to my faithful bosom  Before my heart is motionless and cold  Speak to me Dumnorix my lord my husband  Give one kind accent to thy dying wife  Ere yet my ears be frozen and thy voice  Be heard no longer join thy lip to mine  While I can feel thy last and tend'rest kisses  DUMNORIX  Yes I will utter to thy dying ear  All my fond heart sustain thee on my bosom  And cheer thy parting spirit in its flight  Oh wheresoe'er thy fleeting breath shall pass  Whate'er new body as the Druids sing  Thou shallt inform hereafter still thy soul  Thou gentle kind and everpleasing creature  Shall bear its own felicity along  Still in its native sweetness shall be bless'd  And in its virtue which can thus subdue  The fear of death still brave the pow'r of fortune  But thou beginst to droop  VENUSIA  My eyes grow dizzy  DUMNORIX  aside  Keep firm my heart  VENUSIA  A heaviness like sleep  O'ercomes my sensesEvery limb is faint  Thy voice is scarce distinguish'd in my ears  DUMNORIX  Indeed  VENUSIA  Alas thou lookst so kindly on me  My weak and darken'd sight deceives me sure  Or thy fond eye did never yet o'erflow  With tenderness like this  DUMNORIX  I never view'd thee  For the last time  VENUSIA  Look look upon me still  Why dost thou turn thy face away  DUMNORIX  For nothing  VENUSIA  Nay thou art weeping Dumnorixand wherefore  Wouldst thou conceal thy tears  DUMNORIX  I cannot hide them  VENUSIA  And dost thou weep  DNMNORIX  I do  VENUSIA  Then didst thou love me  With such excess of fondnessFor Venusia  Do these soft streams bedew that awful face  DUMNORIX  Love thee Behold when Albion groans around me  Yet thou these springs of tenderness canst open  To wet the cheeks of British Dumnorix  VENUSIA  Oh extacy which stops my parting soul  And gives it vigour to enjoy these transports  Once more receive me to thy breast  DUMNORIX  Venusia  VENUSIA  Thy tenderness makes death delightful to me  Oh I would speakwould answer to thy kindness  My fault'ring tongue  DUMNORIX  What sayst thou  VENUSIA  Cease to grieve  No pain molests meev'ry thought is calm  Support my drowsy burthen to that couch  Where deathserenely smiles  SCENE  the fourteenth  FLAMINIUS  speaking to the Romans behind the Scene  My warlike friends  Keep backour troops on ev'ry side advance  I cannot long controll them Yet I tremble  To enter thereBy heav'n he lives and sees me  SCENE  the fifteenth  FLAMINIUS  and  DUMNORIX  with his sword drawn  DUMNORIX  Importunate Flaminius Art thou come  To rob my dying moments of their quiet  FLAMINIUS  Forgive the crime of ignoranceForgive  Since accident hath join'd us once again  If strong compassion at thy fate yet pleads  DUMNORIX  What when Venusia is no more  FLAMINIUS  No more  DUMNORIX  No and be further lesson'd by a Briton  Who since his union with the best of women  Hath never known an interval from love  And at this solemn pause yet melts in fondness  While death's black curtain shrouds my cold Venusia  Of dearer value doth my soul esteem her  Than should those eyes rekindle into lustre  And ev'ry charm revive with double pow'r  Of winning beauty if alone to shine  Amid the gloom of bondage  FLAMINIUS  I will urge  No morefarewelour legions hover nigh  SCENE  the sixteenth  DUMNORIX  Now in my breast resume thy wonted seat  Thou manly firmness which so oft has borne me  Through ev'ry toil and danger O return  Rise o'er my sorrow and compleat thy last  Thy highest task to close a life of glory  They comeBe swift my swordBy thee to fall  Near that dear clay extended best becomes  A soldier's courage and a husband's love  SCENE  the last  AENOBARBUS FLAMINIUS  and  ROMANS  AENOBARBUS  To Boadicia's quarter I advanc'd  At thy request who since her last defeat  Blind with despair and disappointed fury  Fled to her tent expiring there I found her  With one illfated daughter both by poison  Nor had the friendly Emmeline escap'd  But by the swift prevention of my hand  Dost thou not thank me whose suggestion prompted  Our quick return to seize the secret pass  Thou gav'st me freedom love and fame repay thee  FLAMINIUS  If thou couldst add that Dumnorix surviv'd  AENOBARBUS  looking into the tent  Thou seest the Gods have otherwise decreed  Forbear to mingle vain regret with conquest  He hath done nobly Fair befal his urn  Death is his triumph which a captive life  Had forfeited to Rome with all the praise  Now from the virtuous to his ashes due  FLAMINIUS  Then art thou fall'n at last thou mighty tow'r  And more than Roman edifice of glory  See too Venusia pale in death's embrace  Presents her faded beauties Lovely ruin  Of ev'ry grace and virtue once the seat  The last kind office from my hand receive  Which shall unite thee to thy husband's side  And to one grave your mingling reliques trust  There soon a hallow'd monument shall rise  Insculptur'd laurel with the myrtle twin'd  The wellwrought stone adorning shall proclaim  His gen'rous valour and thy faithful love  End of the last act  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mr HAVARD  NOW we have shewn the fatal fruits of strife  A hero bleeding with a virtuous wife  A field of war embru'd with nation's gore  Which to the dust the hopes of Albion bore  If weak description and the languid flow  Of strains unequal to this theme of woe  Have fail'd to move the sympathyzing breast  And no soft eyes their melting sense exprest  Not all the wit this after scene might share  Can give success where you refus'd a tear  Much less if haply still the poet's art  Hath stol'n persuasive to the feeling heart  Will he with fancy's wanton hand efface  From gen'rous minds compassion's pleasing trace  Nor from their thoughts while pensive they pursue  This maze of sorrow snatch the moral clue  If yet to him those pow'rs of sacred song  To melt the heart and raise the mind belong  Dar'd he to hope this sketch of early youth  Might stand th'award of nature and of truth  Encourag'd thus hereafter might he soar  With double strength and loftier scenes explore  And following fortune through her various wiles  Shew struggling virtue dress'd in tears or smiles  Perhaps his grateful labours would r  quite  With frequent off'rings one propitious night
