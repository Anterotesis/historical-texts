 LINES c  By  THOMAS PAINE  THE Rain pours down the City looks forlorn  And gloomy subjects suit the howling morn  Close by my sire with door and window fast  And safely shelter'd from the driving blast  To gayer thoughts I bid a days adieu  To spend a scene of solitude with you  So oft has black Revenge engros'd the care  Of all the leisure hours man finds to spare  So oft has guilt in all her thousand dens  Call'd for the vengeance of chastising Pens  That while I fain would ease my heart on you  No thought is left untold no passion new  From flight to flight the mental path appears  Worn with the steps of near six thousand years  And fill  d througout with every scene of pain  From CAIN to G***** and back from G***** to CAIN  Alike in cruelty alike in hate  In guilt alike but more alike in fate  Both curs'd supremely for the blood they drew  Each from the rising world while each was new  Go second CAIN true likeness of the first  And strew thy blasted head with homely dust  In ashes sitin wretched sackcloth weep  And with unpitied sorrows cease to slee    Go haunt the tombs and single out the place  Where earth itself shall suffer a disgrace  Go spell the letters on some mouldring urn  And ask if he who sleeps there can return  Go count the numbers that in sile  lie  And learn by study what it is to die  For sure that heartif any heart you own  Conceits that man expires without a Groan  That he who lives receives from you a grace  Or death is nothing but a change of place  That peace is dull that joy from sorrow springs  And War the Royal raree shew of things  Else why these s  enes that wound the feeling mind  This sport of deaththis Cockpit of Mankind  Why sobs the widow in perpetual pain  Why cries the Orphan"Oh my Father's slain"  Why hangs the Sire his paralytic head  And nods with manly grief"My Son is dead"  Why drops the tears from off the sisters cheek  And sweetly tells the sorrows she would speak  Or why in lonely steps does pensive John  To all the neighbours tell "Poor masters gone"  Oh could I paint the passion I can feel  Or point a horror that would wound like steel  To thy unfeeling unrelenting mind  I'd send a torture and relieve mankind  Thou that art husband father brother all  The tender names which kindred learn to call  Yet like an image carv'd in massey stone  Thou bear'st the shape but sentiment has't none  Allied by dust and figure not by mind  Thou only herd'st but liv'st not with mankind  And prone to love like some outrageous ape  Thou know'st each class of beings by their shape  Since then no hopes to civilize remain  And all petitions have gone forth in vain  One prayer is left which dreads no proud reply  That  he  who made thee breath will make thee die  COMMON SENSE  Passages for Insertion
