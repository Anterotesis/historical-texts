A brief Account OF THE CHIEF PECULIARITIES OF THE  ENGLISH CONSONANTS  By the late Rev Mr T S  AN APPENDIX c    B  is mute before  t  or after  m  in the same syllable as  debt lamb  c    C  sounds soft like  s  when followed by  e i  or an apostrophe denoting the absence of  e  as  cedar city danc'd  c  C  sounds like  sh  when followed by  ea ia ie  or  io  making different syl∣lables as  ocean ancient precious social  c except  society  CC  when followed by  e  or  i  sounds like  x  as in  accept accident  c  C  is mute in  indict victuals scene scent science sciatica scissors scission scy∣mitar  scythe  and the proper names  Scyros Scylla  and  Scythia  In all other cases  c  sounds hard like  k    Ch  when properly English has the same sound with the Italian  c  before  e  or  i  Example  child chain  c  It sounds also like  sh  in words de∣rived from the French as  chaise Champaigne  c and like  k  in words of Greek extraction as  Christ school stomach archangel  c pro∣nounced  arkangel  But if  arch  comes before a consonant  ch  has then its proper English sound as in  archbishop  Ch  in  loch  sounds like  f  Ch  is mute in  drachm schedule  and  schism    D  is mute before  ge  as in  judge bridge  c also in  soldier    F  in  of  sounds like  v    G  sounds  soft  like  j  before  e i  or an  apostrophe  and  hard  like the Greek γ in all other cases  Example  Angel rage rag'd giant ginger  c  Exceptions to  g  's sounding soft  In the participles passive of words ending in  g  hard and also where∣ever  g  is doubled it continues hard notwithstanding the vowels  e  or  i  or an  apostrophe  as in  dragg'd begging digging  c  In the termination  ger  wherever it makes a distinct syllable  g  sounds hard as in  anger finger longer stronger  c in which kind of words it may be observed that the  g  sounds double so as to belong to both syllables  Derivatives in  er ed  or  ing  from pri∣mitives in  ng  retain the  g  hard as  singing singer  from  sing hanging hanger  from  hang winged  or  wing'd  from  wing  c in which kind of words it may be observed that  g  sounds  single  and belongs to the  first syllable only  In the following words  g  is hard notwithstanding it comes before  e  or  i  viz  geese gewgaw geld gelt Gertrude get  with its compounds  gibberish gibbous giddy gift gig gig∣gle gild girl give forgive gilt gimb∣let gimp gird girt girdle begin  gizzard Gideon Gibbons Gilbert  and  Gilpin  G is mute before  n  in the same sylla∣ble as  guash sign sovereign  c also in  phlegm seraglio  and  bagnio    Gh  sounds like  g  hard in  ghost  and like  ff  in  cough lough laugh laughter rough slough tough trough  and  e∣nough  In other words it is mute    H  is mute in  hour honour honest heir herb humour hostler thyme John Thomas Thomasin  and  Thames  Also in Greek words when preceded by R as  rheum rhyme rhetoric myrrh  c and lastly at the end of words as  ah hah Isaiah Sarah  c    K  is mute before  n  in the same syllable as in  knave know knight  c    L  is mute in  balk talk walk stalk halm calm calf calves falcon half  alves holme  an island and  Holmes  a surname  psalm qualm salmon could should  and  would    N  is mute after  m  in the same sylla∣ble as  hymn autumn solemn  c    P  is mute before  s  and between  m  and  t  as  psalm tempt  c    Ph  is always sounded like  f  except in  Stephen nephew  and  phial  where it sounds like  v  Ph  is mute in  phthisic  and is pro∣nounced  tizzic    Q  is always followed by  u  and when it begins a syllable sounds like  cw  by which as Mr Johnson ob∣serves our Saxon ancestors well expressed it But in termina∣tions from the Latin  quus  and also in words of French extrac∣tion it sounds like  k  Example  Oblique antique quoif conquer risque traffique  c some of which words are now more commonly spelt with  c  or  k  as  coif risk traf∣fic  c    S  sounds like  z  In the third persons singular of all verbs and the plural number of all nouns as in  has was tries bees times  c  In pronouns possessive as  his hers theirs  and also when prece∣ded by the comma denoting posses∣sion as  father's mother's Tom's  Will's  c Also in the particle  as  Exceptions to the two last Sections  S  has its proper sound when preceded by  c k ck f p q  or  t  which admit not the sound of  z  so easily after them as in  speaks beats rocks Jack's Dick's Gilbert's cock's spur cat's paw  c    S  sounds like  z  preceded by a li∣quid in the same syllable as  dam∣sel crimson Thames Jersey Guern∣sey  c and also    S  between two vowels most commonly sounds like  z  as  daisy reprisal pleasant please rosin  c  Except  house mouse louse goose geese sausage purchase promise case ma∣son bason basis phasis  and  thesis  Except also substantives in  use  de∣rived from Latin verbs as  use a∣buse disuse refuse excuse  c and adjectives derived from the parti∣ciples passive of some Latin verbs as  recluse profuse abstruse  c  Lastly Except also the words con∣tained in the next section but one where  s  sounds like  zh  II  S  and  ss  sound like  sh  in  sure  with its compounds  issue tissue fissure pressure Russian  c also in the terminations  assion ession ission ussion  as in  passion impression mis∣sion concussion  c  III  S  when preceded by a vowel and followed by  ion  or  ian  sounds like  zh  as  invasion Ephesian vision de∣lusion  c But if it be preceded by a consonant it sounds like  sh  as in  conversion Persian  c  S  sounds also like  zh  before  ier  as  osier hosier glasier brasier  c and in the words  leisure measure pleasure  and  treasure  S  is mute in  isle Lisle Carlisle island viscount  and  demesne    T  before  io  or  ia  making part of the same syllable with  i  sounds like  sh  as  nation cautious Egyp∣tian satiate  c But if  t  be∣long to the former syllable its re∣tains  its proper sound as  question fustian combustion  c  T  is mute in words ending with  stle  as  castle thistle bristle  c  Th  has two sounds the one soft as in  thy  the other hard like the Greek θ as in  thigh  I  Th  sounds soft  st in  thence there  with their com∣pounds  then that the thee these this those thus thou thy thine their theirs them though although beneath bequeath betroth mouths tythe seythe wreath booth  and in the verbs  bathe mouth seeth loathe soothe  and  breathe  dly Wherever it occurs between two vowels as  father mother  c except words of Greek extraction and also derivatives from words ending with  th  hard as  earthen  from  earth  c  dly  Th  sounds soft when placed be∣tween  r  and a vowel as  burthen murther  c though in such words  d  is often pronounced instead of  th  as  murder burden  In other cases  th  sounds  hard  Th  is mute in  asthma  with its deriva∣tives    W  is mute before  r  in the same sylla∣ble as  write wrath  c also in  sword swoon  and  answer  with their compounds and derivatives  The other consonants have the same powers as in other languages  The  Lord's Prayer  the  Creed  and the  Ten Commandments c  divided into syl∣lables according to the  rule for spel∣ling  recommended by the learned Bishop Lowth with references placed to those syllables which are  exceptions  to the several  rules  laid down in this book respecting the pronunciation of vowels and diphthongs  The LORD's PRAYER  OUR Fáther    which art in
