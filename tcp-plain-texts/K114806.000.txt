LONG has the Muse her tale delay'd  Has stopt to talk of Johnny's trade  Wife daughter mother too of John  And quite forgot to travel on  Long has the Muse with trembling fear  View'd the sad scene that now is near  Hung back indeed from very fright  And shrunk and started at the sight  As the tall steed if he should spy  Some unknown form of danger nigh  Starts from his path his eyeballs glare  His feet fly prancing in the air  Round on the spot and round he wheels  Upright upon his meer hind heels  So have we started at the view  Of what our John is now to do  Have gaily frisk'd it round and round  Nor gain'd as you an inch of ground  Come gentle Muse the tale declare  Sing how this bold advent'rous pair  With mother brave and willing daughter  March'd to the borders of the water  Sing how they trod the beech so steep  Gaz'd at the wonders of the deep  And stopt to view as in a trance  The awful ocean's vast expanse  Then gaz'd at ev'ry passing boat  Till they quite long'd to get on float  The Boatmen as they cross the Strand  Spring from an alehouse just at hand  All on the party down they burst  And each is sure that he was first  Oh how they press and fill the ground  And push and elbow all around  Each to a Lady makes his suit  Till Nancy starts as at a brute  While prudent Johnny marching down  Hires a snug boat for half a crown  Of smaller size but stiff and tight  And having seen that all is right  Rallies his daughter claims his wife  Bursts thro' the crowd and ends the strife  And now with selfcomplacent grin  The favor'd Boatman hands them in  But first he plants as is his rule  On the wave's edge his little stool  And while he begs them to take care  Presents his elbow high in air  All in they stept all down they sat  All safe all even and all  lat  The Boatman pushes off the boat  Was e'er such treasure all afloat  And now amid the sun's bright gleam  See how they cut the silver stream  See how the breeze begins to play  See how it wafts them far away  Scarce had the party left the shore  When Ruffman longs to spare his oar  Points to the bench where lies a sail  And begs to profit by the gale  At first the Boatman's words appal  And all the female faces fall  And Madam bets ten thousand pound  "This instant we shall be drown'd"  Mean time old Ruffman with a sneer  Forbids each vain and silly fear  Talks of the seas that he hath cross'd  Beaten and blown and tempest tost  Tells of his dangers now no more  While a green youth in days of yore  Of feats perform'd by way of fun  And boasts of matches he has won  Then drops his tone and quite allays  All the new fears he seem'd to raise  Pleads his great care asserts his skill  Begs each dear Lady'll dread no ill  For if he keeps the rope in hand  The water's just as safe as land  Thus all objections down he beat  And now the awful sail is set  Ah how they plough the whit'ning seas  So fine so glorious is the breeze  How fresh and cooling too the air  While the sail shades them from the glare  The Boatman who a while before  Sat coatless heated at the oar  Now lolls his ease observes the wind  Steers with one careful hand behind  While his right fist holds hard the sa  Resists or humours well the gale  Then halfappearing to turn back  At once he stops and makes a tack  Points at the distant and once more  And seems to run you right ashore  But ere he lets you quite touch ground  Again he spins his vessel round  And shifts across with skill so nice  The flutt'ring canvas in a trice  Scuds o'er the spacious seas again  Again he plows the mighty main  Again the less'ning shore retires  Woods hills depart and distant spires  While the bright sun yon clouds between  Shines forth and gilds the glorious scene  The party eas'd of all their fright  Gaze round and round with sweet delight  Praise with one voice both land and seas  And now they languish for a breeze  Dread lest the slack'ning wind should fail  And welcome every growing gale  Swift o'er the swelling waves they fly  And pleasure beams in ev'ry eye  But ah how oft with genial fun  While the gay course of life we run  And fancy as we taste the treat  Our human bliss is now compleat  How oft in that same favor'd hour  Does the whole sky begin to lour  The cheering sunshine's pass'd away  There comes a dreary doleful day  Afflictions gather like a cloud  The swelling tempest roars aloud  While from yon threat'ning heav'ns so dark  It thunders round our little bark  Unskill'd to struggle thro' the breeze  We toss in new and troubled seas  And life's gay morning all so bright  Ends in some woeful tale at night  THE END OF THE THIRD PART
