versibus annos  Moeoniumque bibat foelici pectore fontem  PETR  LONDON  Printed by W BOWYER for BERNARD LINTOTT between the  TempleGates    THE NINTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Embassy to  Achilles  AGamemnon  after the last Day's Defeat proposes to the  Greeks  to quit the Siege and return to their Country  Diomed  opposes this and  Nestor  seconds him praising his Wisdom and Resolution He orders the Guard to be strengthen'd and a Council summon'd to deliberate what Measures were to be follow'd in this Emergency  Agamemnon  pursues this Advice and  Nestor  farther prevails upon him to send Ambassadors to  Achilles  in order to move him to a Reconciliation  Ulysses  and  Ajax  are made choice of who are accompanied by old  Phoenix  They make each of them very moving and pressing Speeches but are rejected with Roughness by  Achilles  who notwithstanding retains  Phoenix  in his Tent The Ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the Camp and the Troops betake themselves to sleep  This Book and the next following take up the Space of one  Night  which is the twenty seventh from the beginning of the Poem The  Scene  lies on the Seashore the Station of the  Grecian  Ships  THE NINTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THUS joyful  Troy  maintain'd the Watch of Night  While Fear pale Comrade of inglorious Flight  And heav'nbred Horror on the  Grecian  part  Sate on each Face and sadden'd ev'ry heart  As from its cloudy Dungeon issuing forth  A double Tempest of the West and North  Swells o'er the Sea from  Thracia  's frozen Shore  Heaps Waves on Waves and bids th'  Aegean  roar  This way and that the boiling Deeps are tost  Such various Passions urg'd the troubled Host  Great  Agamemnon  griev'd above the rest  Superior Sorrows swell'd his Royal Breast  Himself his Orders to the Heralds bears  To bid to Council all the  Grecian  Peers  But bid in Whispers These surround their Chief  In solemn Sadness and majestic Grief  The King amidst the mournful Circle rose  Down his wan Cheek a briny Torrent flows  So silent Fountains from a Rock's tall Head  In sable Streams softtrickling Waters shed  With more than vulgar Grief he stood opprest  Words mixt with Sighs thus bursting from his Breast  Ye Sons of  Greece  partake your Leader's Care  Fellows in Arms and Princes of the War  Of partial  Jove  too justly we complain  And heav'nly Oracles believ'd in vain  A safe Return was promis'd to our toils  With Conquest honour'd and enrich'd with Spoils  Now shameful flight alone can save the Host  Our Wealth our People and our Glory lost  So  Jove  decrees Almighty Lord of all  Jove  at whose Nod whole Empires rise or fall  Who shakes the feeble Props of human Trust  And Tow'rs and Armies humbles to the Dust  Haste then for ever quit these fatal Fields  Haste to the Joys our native Country yields  Spread all your Canvas all your Oars employ  Nor hope the Fall of heav'ndefended  Troy  He said deep Silence held the  Grecian  Band  Silent unmov'd in dire Dismay they stand  A pensive Scene 'till  Tydeus'  warlike Son  Roll'd on the King his Eyes and thus begun  When Kings advise us to renounce our Fame  First let him speak who first has suffer'd Shame  If I oppose thee Prince thy Wrath withhold  The Laws of Council bid my Tongue be bold  Thou first and thou alone in Fields of Fight  Durst brand my courage and defame my might  Nor from a Friend th' unkind Reproach appear'd  The  Greeks  stood witness all our Army heard  The Gods O Chief from whom our honours spring  The Gods have made thee but by halves a King  They gave thee Scepters and a wide Command  They gave Dominion o'er the Seas and Land  The noblest Pow'r that might the World controul  They gave thee nota brave and virtuous Soul  Is this a Gen'ral's Voice that would suggest  Fears like his own to ev'ry  Grecian  Breast  Confiding in our want of Worth he stands  And if we fly 'tis what our King commands  Go thou inglorious from th' embattel'd Plain  Ships thou hast store and nearest to the Main  A nobler Care the  Grecians  shall employ  To combate conquer and extirpate  Troy  Here  Greece  shall stay or if all  Greece  retire  My self will stay till  Troy  or I expire  My self and  Sthenelus  will fight for Fame  God bad us fight and 'twas with God we came  He ceas'd the  Greeks  loud Acclamations raise  And Voice to Voice resounds  Tydides'  Praise  Wise  Nestor  then his Rev'rend Figure rear'd  He spoke the Host in still Attention heard  O truly great in whom the Gods have join'd  Such Strength of Body with such Force of Mind  In Conduct as in Courage you excell  Still first to act what you advise so well  Those wholsome Counsels which thy Wisdom moves  Applauding  Greece  with common Voice approves  Kings thou canst blame a bold but prudent Youth  And blame ev'n Kings with Praise because with Truth  And yet those Years that since thy Birth have run  Would hardly stile thee  Nestor  's youngest Son  Then let me add what yet remains behind  A Thought unfinish'd in that gen'rous Mind  Age bids me speak nor shall th'Advice I bring  Distast the People or offend the King  Curs'd is the Man and void of Law and Right  Unworthy Property unworthy Light  Unfit for publick Rule or private Care  That Wretch that Monster who delights in War  Whose Lust is Murder and whose horrid Joy  To tear his Country and his Kind destroy  This Night refresh and fortify thy Train  Between the Trench and Wall let Guards remain  Be that the Duty of the young and bold  But thou O King to Council call the old  Great is thy Sway and weighty are thy Cares  Thy high Commands must spirit all our Wars  With  Thracian  Wines recruit thy honour'd Guests  For happy Counsels flow from sober Feasts  Wise weighty Counsels aid a State distrest  And such a Monarch as can chuse the best  See what a Blaze from hostile Tents aspires  How near our Fleet approach the  Trojan  Fires  Who can unmov'd behold the dreadful Light  What Eye beholds 'em and can close to night  This dreadful Interval determines all  To morrow  Troy  must flame or  Greece  must fall  Thus spoke the hoary Sage the rest obey  Swift thro' the Gates the Guards direct their way  His Son was first to pass the lofty Mound  The gen'rous  Thrasymed  in Arms renown'd  Next him  Ascalaphus Iäalmen  stood  The double Offspring of the WarriorGod  Deipyrus Aphareus Merion  join  And  Lycomed  of  Creon  's noble Line  Sev'n were the Leaders of the nightly Bands  And each bold Chief a hundred Spears commands  The Fires they light to short Repasts they fall  Some line the Trench and others man the Wall  The King of Men on publick Counsels bent  Conven'd the Princes in his ample Tent  Each seiz'd a Portion of the Kingly Feast  But stay'd his Hand when Thirst and Hunger ceast  Then  Nestor  spoke for Wisdom long approv'd  And slowly rising thus the Council mov'd  Monarch of Nations whose superior Sway  Assembled States and Lords of Earth obey  The Laws and Scepters to thy Hand are giv'n  And Millions own the Care of thee and Heav'n  O King the Counsels of my Age attend  With thee my Cares begin in thee must end  Thee Prince it fits alike to speak and hear  Pronounce with Judgment with Regard give ear  To see no wholsom Motion be withstood  And ratify the best for publick Good  Nor tho' a meaner give Advice repine  But follow it and make the Wisdom thine  Hear then a Thought not now conceiv'd in hast  At once my present Judgment and my past  When from  Pelides'  Tent you forc'd the Maid  I first oppos'd and faithful durst dissuade  But bold of Soul when headlong Fury fir'd  You wrong'd the Man by Men and Gods admir'd  Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end  With Pray'rs to move him or with Gifts to bend  To whom the King With Justice hast thou shown  A Prince's Faults and I with Reason own  That happy Man whom  Jove  still honours most  Is more than Armies and himself an Host  Blest in his Love this wond'rous Hero stands  Heav'n fights his War and humbles all our Bands  Fain wou'd my Heart which err'd thro' frantic Rage  The wrathful Chief and angry Gods assuage  If Gifts immense his mighty Soul can bow  Hear all ye  Greeks  and witness what I vow  Ten weighty Talents of the purest Gold  And twice ten Vases of refulgent Mold  Sev'n sacred Tripods whose unfully'd Frame  Yet knows no Office nor has felt the Flame  Twelve Steeds unmatch'd in Fleetness and in Force  And still victorious in the dusty Course  Rich were the Man whose ample Stores exceed  The Prizes purchas'd by their winged Speed  Sev'n lovely Captives of the  Lesbian  Line  Skill'd in each Art unmatch'd in Form divine  The same I chose for more than vulgar Charms  When  Lesbos  sunk beneath the Hero's Arms  All these to buy his Friendship shall be paid  And join'd with these the long contested Maid  With all her Charms  Briseis  I resign  And solemn swear those Charms were never mine  Untouch'd she stay'd uninjur'd she removes  Pure from my Arms and guiltless of my Loves  These instant shall be his and if the Pow'rs  Give to our Arms proud  Ilion  's hostile Tow'rs  Then shall he store when  Greece  the Spoil divides  With Gold and Brass his loaded Navy's sides  Besides full twenty Nymphs of  Trojan  Race  With copious Love shall crown his warm Embrace  Such as himself will chuse who yield to none  Or yield to  Helen  's heav'nly Charms alone  Yet hear me farther When our Wars are o'er  If safe we land on  Argos  fruitful Shore  There shall he live my Son our Honours share  And with  Orestes'  self divide my Care  Yet morethree Daughters in my Court are bred  And each well worthy of a Royal Bed  Laodice  and  Iphigenia  fair  And bright  Chrysothemis  with golden Hair  Her let him choose whom most his Eyes approve  I ask no Presents no Reward for Love  My self will give the Dow'r so vast a Store  As never Father gave a Child before  Sev'n ample Cities shall confess his Sway  Him  Enope  and  Phaerae  him obey  Cardamyle  with ample Turrets crown'd  And sacred  Pedasus  for Vines renown'd  Aepea  fair the Pastures  Hyra  yields  And rich  Antheia  with her flow'ry Fields  The whole Extent to  Pylos'  sandy Plain  Along the verdant Margin of the Main  There Heifers graze and lab'ring Oxen toil  Bold are the Men and gen'rous is the Soil  There shall he reign with Pow'r and Justice crown'd  And rule the tributary Realms around  All this I give his Vengeance to controul  And sure all this may move his mighty Soul  Pluto  the grizly God who never spares  Who feels no Mercy and who hears no Pray'rs  Lives dark and dreadful in deep Hell's Abodes  And Mortals hate him as the worst of Gods  Great tho' he be it fits him to obey  Since more than his my Years and more my Sway  The Monarch thus the Rev'rend  Nestor  then  Great  Agamemnon  glorious King of Men  Such are thy Offers as a Prince may take  And such as fits a gen'rous King to make  Let chosen Delegates this Hour be sent  My self will name them to  Pelides'  Tent  Let  Phaenix  lead rever'd for hoary Age  Great  Ajax  next and  Ithacus  the sage  Yet more to sanctify the Word you send  Let  Hodius  and  Eurybates  attend  Now pray to  Jove  to grant what  Greece  demands  Pray in deep Silence and with purest Hands  He said and all approv'd The Heralds bring  The cleansing Water from the living Spring  The Youth with Wine the sacred Goblets crown'd  And large Libations drench'd the Sands around  The Rite perform'd the Chiefs their Thirst allay  Then from the Royal Tent they took their way  Wise  Nestor  turns on each his careful Eye  Forbids t' offend instructs them to apply  Much he advis'd them all  Ulysses  most  To deprecate the Chief and save the Host  Thro' the still Night they march and hear the roar  Of murm'ring Billows on the sounding Shore  To  Neptune  Ruler of the Seas profound  Whose liquid Arms the mighty Globe surround  They pour forth Vows their Embassy to bless  And calm the Rage of stern  Aeacides  And now arriv'd where on the sandy Bay  The  Myrmidonian  Tents and Vessels lay  Amus'd at Ease the godlike Man they found  Pleas'd with the solemn Harp's harmonious Sound  The wellwrought Harp from conquer'd  Thebae  came  Of polish'd Silver was its costly Frame  With this he sooths his angry Soul and sings  Th' immortal Deeds of Heroes and of Kings  Patroclus  only of the Royal Train  Plac'd in his Tent attends the lofty Strain  Full opposite he sate and listen'd long  In Silence waiting till he ceas'd the Song  Unseen the  Grecian  Embassy proceeds  To his high Tent the great  Ulysses  leads  Achilles  starting as the Chiefs he spy'd  Leap'd from his Seat and laid the Harp aside  With like Surprize arose  Menaetius'  Son  Pelides  grasp'd their Hands and thus begun  Princes all hail whatever brought ye here  Or strong Necessity or urgent Fear  Welcome tho'  Greeks  for not as Foes ye came  To me more dear than all that bear the Name  With that the Chiefs beneath his Roof he led  And plac'd in Seats with purple Carpets spread  Then thus  Patroclus  crown a larger Bowl  Mix purer Wine and open ev'ry Soul  Of all the Warriors yonder Host can send  Thy Friend most honours these and these thy Friend  He said  Patroclus  o'er the blazing Fire  Heaps in a Brazen Vase three Chines entire  The Brazen Vase  Automedon  sustains  Which Flesh of Porker Sheep and Goat contains  Achilles  at the genial Feast presides  The Parts transfixes and with Skill divides  Mean while  Patroclus  sweats the Fire to raise  The Tent is brightned with the rising Blaze  Then when the languid Flames at length subside  He strows a Bed of glowing Embers wide  Above the Coals the smoaking Fragments turns  And sprinkles sacred Salt from lifted Urns  With Bread the glitt'ring Canisters they load  Which round the Board  Menaetius'  Son bestow'd  Himself oppos'd t'  Ulysses  full in sight  Each Portion parts and orders ev'ry Rite  The first fat Off'rings to th'Immortals due  Amidst the greedy Flames  Patroclus  threw  Then each indulging in the social Feast  His Thirst and Hunger soberly represt  That done to  Phaenix Ajax  gave the Sign  Not unperceiv'd  Ulysses  crown'd with Wine  The foaming Bowl and instant thus began  His Speech addressing to the Godlike Man  Health to  Achilles  happy are thy Guests  Not those more honour'd whom  Atrides  feasts  Tho' gen'rous Plenty crown thy loaded Boards  That  Agamemnon  's regal Tent affords  But greater Cares sit heavy on our Souls  Not eas'd by Banquets or by flowing Bowls  What Scenes of Slaughter in yon Fields appear  The dead we mourn and for the living fear  Greece  on the Brink of Fate all doubtful stands  And owns no Help but from thy saving Hands  Troy  and her Aids for ready Vengeance call  Their threat'ning Tents already shade our Wall  Hear how with Shouts their Conquest they proclaim  And point at ev'ry Ship their vengeful Flame  For them the Father of the Gods declares  Theirs are his Omens and his Thunder theirs  See full of  Jove  avenging  Hector  rise  See Heav'n and Earth the raging Chief defies  What Fury in his Breast what Light'ning in his Eyes  He waits but for the Morn to sink in Flame  The Ships the  Greeks  and all the  Grecian  Name  Heav'ns how my Country's Woes distract my Mind  Lest Fate accomplish all his Rage design'd  And must we Gods our Heads inglorious lay  In  Trojan  Dust and this the fatal Day  Return  Achilles  oh return tho' late  To save thy  Greeks  and stop the Course of Fate  If in that Heart or Grief or Courage lies  Rise to redeem ah yet to conquer rise  The Day may come when all our Warriors slain  That Heart shall melt that Courage rise in vain  Regard in time O Prince divinely brave  Those wholsome Counsels which thy Father gave  When  Peleus  in his aged Arms embrac'd  His parting Son these Accents were his last  My Child with Strength with Glory and Success  Thy Arms may  Juno  and  Minerva  bless  Trust that to Heav'nbut thou thy Cares engage  To calm thy Passions and subdue thy Rage  From gentler Manners let thy Glory grow  And shun Contention the sure Source of Woe  That young and old may in thy Praise combine  The Virtues of Humanity be thine  This now despis'd Advice thy Father gave  Ah check thy Anger and be truly brave  If thou wilt yield to great  Atrides'  Pray'rs  Gifts worthy thee his Royal Hand prepares  If notbut hear me while I number o'er  The proffer'd Presents an exhaustless Store  Ten weighty Talents of the purest Gold  And twice ten Vases of refulgent Mold  Sev'n sacred Tripods whose unsully'd Frame  Yet knows no Office nor has felt the Flame  Twelve Steeds unmatch'd in Fleetness and in Force  And still victorious in the dusty Course  Rich were the Man whose ample Stores exceed  The Prizes purchas'd by their winged Speed  Sev'n lovely Captives of the  Lesbian  Line  Skill'd in each Art unmatch'd in Form divine  The same he chose for more than vulgar Charms  When  Lesbos  sunk beneath thy conqu'ring Arms  All these to buy thy Friendship shall be paid  And join'd with these the long contested Maid  With all her Charms  Briseis  he'll resign  And solemn swear those Charms were only thine  Untouch'd she stay'd uninjur'd she removes  Pure from his Arms and guiltless of his Loves  These instant shall be thine and if the Pow'rs  Give to our Arms proud  Ilion  's hostile Tow'rs  Then shalt thou store when  Greece  the Spoil divides  With Gold and Brass thy loaded Navy's sides  Besides full twenty Nymphs of  Trojan  Race  With copious Love shall crown thy warm Embrace  Such as thy self shall chuse who yield to none  Or yield to  Helen  's heav'nly Charms alone  Yet hear me farther When our Wars are o'er  If safe we land on  Argos  fruitful Shore  There shalt thou live his Son his Honours share  And with  Orestes'  self divide his Care  Yet morethree Daughters in his Court are bred  And each well worthy of a Royal Bed  Laodice  and  Iphigenia  fair  And bright  Chrysothemis  with golden Hair  Her shalt thou wed whom most thy Eyes approve  He asks no Presents no Reward for Love  Himself will give the Dow'r so vast a Store  As never Father gave a Child before  Sev'n ample Cities shall confess thy Sway  Thee  Enope  and  Phaerae  thee obey  Cardamyle  with ample Turrets crown'd  And sacred  Pedasus  for Vines renown'd  Aepea  fair the Pastures  Hyra  yields  And rich  Antheia  with her flow'ry Fields  The whole Extent to  Pylos'  sandy Plain  Along the verdant Margin of the Main  There Heifers graze and lab'ring Oxen toil  Bold are the Men and gen'rous is the Soil  There shalt thou reign with Pow'r and Justice crown'd  And rule the tributary Realms around  Such are the Proffers which this Day we bring  Such the Repentance of a suppliant King  But if all this relentless thou disdain  If Honour and if Int'rest plead in vain  Yet some Redress to suppliant  Greece  afford  And be amongst her guardian Gods ador'd  If no Regard thy suff'ring Country claim  Hear thy own Glory and the Voice of Fame  For now that Chief whose unresisted Ire  Made Nations tremble and whole Hosts retire  Proud  Hector  now th' unequal Fight demands  And only triumphs to deserve thy Hands  Then thus the Goddessborn  Ulysses  hear  A faithful Speech that knows nor Art nor Fear  What in my secret Soul is understood  My Tongue shall utter and my Deeds make good  Let  Greece  then know my Purpose I retain  Nor with new Treaties vex my Peace in vain  Who dares think one thing and another tell  My Heart detests him as the Gates of Hell  Then thus in short my fixt Resolves attend  Which nor  Atrides  nor his  Greeks  can bend  Long Toils long Perils in their Cause I bore  But now th' unfruitful Glories charm no more  Fight or not fight a like Reward we claim  The Wretch and Hero find their Prize the same  Alike regretted in the Dust he lies  Who yields ignobly or who bravely dies  Of all my Dangers all my glorious Pains  A Life of Labours lo what Fruit remains  As the bold Bird her helpless Young attends  From Danger guards them and from Want defends  In Search of Prey she wings the spacious Air  And with th' untasted Food supplies her Care  For thankless  Greece  such Hardships have I brav'd  Her Wives her Infants by my Labours sav'd  Long sleepless Nights in heavy Arms I stood  And sweat laborious Days in Dust and Blood  I sack'd twelve ample Cities on the Main  And twelve lay smoaking on the  Trojan  Plain  Then at  Atrides'  haughty Feet were laid  The Wealth I gather'd and the Spoils I made  Your mighty Monarch these in Peace possest  Some few my Soldiers had himself the rest  Some Present too to ev'ry Prince was paid  And ev'ry Prince enjoys the Gift he made  I only must refund of all his Train  See what Preheminence our Merits gain  My Spoil alone his greedy Soul delights  My Spouse alone must bless his lustful Nights  The Woman let him as he may enjoy  But what's the Quarrel then of  Greece  to  Troy  What to these Shores th' assembled Nations draws  What calls for Vengeance but a Woman's Cause  Are fair Endowments and a beauteous Face  Belov'd by none but those of  Atreus'  Race  The Wife whom Choice and Passion both approve  Sure ev'ry wise and worthy Man will love  Nor did my fair one less Distinction claim  Slave as she was my Soul ador'd the Dame  Wrong'd in my Love all Proffers I disdain  Deceiv'd for once I trust not Kings again  Ye have my Answerwhat remains to do  Your King  Ulysses  may consult with you  What needs he the Defence this Arm can make  Has he not Walls no human Force can shake  Has he not fenc'd his guarded Navy round  With Piles with Ramparts and a Trench profound  And will not these the Wonders he has done  Repell the Rage of  Priam  's single Son  There was a time 'twas when for  Greece  I fought  When  Hector  's Prowess no such Wonders wrought  He kept the Verge of  Troy  nor dar'd to wait  Achilles'  Fury at the  Scaean  Gate  He try'd it once and scarce was sav'd by Fate  But now those ancient Enmities are o'er  To morrow we the fav'ring Gods implore  Then shall you see our parting Vessels crown'd  And hear with Oars the  Hellespont  resound  The third Day hence shall  Pthia  greet our Sails  If mighty  Neptune  send propitious Gales  Pthia  to her  Achilles  shall restore  The Wealth he left for this detested Shore  Thither the Spoils of this long War shall pass  The ruddy Gold the Steel and shining Brass  My beauteous Captives thither I'll convey  And all that rests of my unravish'd Prey  One only valu'd Gift your Tyrant gave  And that resum'd the fair  Lyrnessian  Slave  Then tell him loud that all the  Greeks  may hear  And learn to scorn the Wretch they basely fear  For arm'd in Impudence Mankind he braves  And meditates new Cheats on all his Slaves  Tho' shameless as he is to face these Eyes  Is what he dares not if he dares he dies  Tell him all Terms all Commerce I decline  Nor share his Council nor his Battel join  For once deceiv'd was his but twice were mine  Nolet the stupid Prince whom  Jove  deprives  Of Sense and Justice run where Frenzy drives  His Gifts are hateful Kings of such a Kind  Stand but as Slaves before a noble Mind  Not tho' he proffer'd all himself possest  And all his Rapine cou'd from others wrest  Not all the golden Tydes of Wealth that crown  The manypeopled  Orchomenian  Town  Not all proud  Thebes'  unrival'd Walls contain  The World's great Empress on th'  Aegyptian  Plain  That spreads her Conquests o'er a thousand States  And pours her Heroes thro' a hundred Gates  Two hundred Horsemen and two hundred Cars  From each wide Portal issuing to the Wars  Tho' Bribes were heap'd on Bribes in Number more  Than Dust in Fields or Sands along the Shore  Should all these Offers for my Friendship call  'Tis he that offers and I scorn them all  Atrides'  Daughter never shall be led  An illmatch'd Consort to  Achilles'  Bed  Like golden  Venus  tho' she charm'd the Heart  And vy'd with  Pallas  in the Works of Art  Some greater  Greek  let those high Nuptials grace  I hate Alliance with a Tyrant's Race  If Heav'n restore me to my Realms with Life  The rev'rend  Peleus  shall elect my Wife  Thessalian  Nymphs there are of Form divine  And Kings that sue to mix their Blood with mine  Blest in kind Love my Years shall glide away  Content with just hereditary Sway  There deaf for ever to the martial Strife  Enjoy the dear Prerogative of Life  Life is not to be bought with Heaps of Gold  Not all  Apollo  's  Pythian  Treasures hold  Or  Troy  once held in Peace and Pride of Sway  Can bribe the poor Possession of a Day  Lost Herds and Treasures we by Arms regain  And Steeds unrival'd on the dusty Plain  But from our Lips the vital Spirit fled  Returns no more to wake the silent dead  My Fates long since by  Thetis  were disclos'd  And each alternate Life or Fame propos'd  Here if I stay before the  Trojan  Town  Short is my Date but deathless my Renown  If I return I quit immortal Praise  For Years on Years and longextended Days  Convinc'd tho' late I find my fond Mistake  And warn the  Greeks  the wiser Choice to make  To quit these Shores their native Seats enjoy  Nor hope the Fall of Heav'ndefended  Troy  Jove  's Arm display'd asserts her from the Skies  Her Hearts are strengthen'd and her Glories rise  Go then to  Greece  report our fixt Design  Bid all your Counsels all your Armies join  Let all your Forces all your Arts conspire  To save the Ships the Troops the Chiefs from Fire  One Stratagem has fail'd and others will  Ye find  Achilles  is unconquer'd still  Go thendigest my Message as ye may  But here this Night let rev'rend  Phaenix  stay  His tedious Toils and hoary Hairs demand  A peaceful Death in  Pthia  's friendly Land  But whether he remain or sail with me  His Age be sacred and his Will be free  The Son of  Peleus  ceas'd The Chiefs around  In Silence wrapt in Consternation drown'd  Attend the stern Reply Then  Phaenix  rose  Down his white Beard a Stream of Sorrow flows  And while the Fate of suff'ring  Greece  he mourn'd  With Accents weak these tender Words return'd  Divine  Achilles  wilt thou then retire  And leave our Hosts in Blood our Fleets on Fire  If Wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless Mind  How shall thy Friend thy  Phaenix  stay behind  The Royal  Peleus  when from  Pthia  's Coast  He sent thee early to th'  Achaian  Hoast  Thy Youth as then in sage Debates unskill'd  And new to Perils of the direful Field  He bade me teach thee all the ways of War  To shine in Councils and in Camps to dare  Never ah never let me leave thy side  No Time shall part us and no Fate divide  Not tho' the God that breath'd my Life restore  The Bloom I boasted and the Port I bore  When  Greece  of old beheld my youthful Flames  Delightful  Greece  the Land of lovely Dames  My Father faithless to my Mother's Arms  Old as he was ador'd a Stranger's Charms  I try'd what Youth could do at her Desire  To win the Damsel and prevent my Sire  My Sire with Curses loads my hated Head  And cries Ye Furies barren be his Bed  Infernal  Jove  the vengeful Fiends below  And ruthless  Proserpine  confirm'd his Vow  Despair and Grief distract my lab'ring Mind  Gods what a Crime my impious Heart design'd  I thought but some kind God that Thought supprest  To plunge the Ponyard in my Father's Breast  Then meditate my Flight my Friends in vain  With Pray'rs entreat me and with Force detain  On fat of Rams black Bulls and brawny Swine  They daily feast with Draughts of fragrant Wine  Strong Guards they plac'd and watch'd nine Nights entire  The Roofs and Porches flam'd with constant Fire  The tenth I forc'd the Gates unseen of all  And favour'd by the Night o'er leap'd the Wall  My Travels thence thro' spacious  Greece  extend  In  Pthia  's Court at last my Labours end  Your Sire receiv'd me as his Son caress'd  With Gifts enrich'd and with Possessions bless'd  The strong  Dolopians  thenceforth own'd my Reign  And all the Coast that runs along the Main  By Love to thee his Bounties I repay'd  And early Wisdom to thy Soul convey'd  Great as thou art my Lessons made thee brave  A Child I took thee but a Hero gave  Thy Infant Breast a like Affection show'd  Still in my Arms an everpleasing Load  Or at my Knee by  Phoenix  wouldst thou stand  No Food was grateful but from  Phoenix'  Hand  I pass my Watchings o'er thy helpless Years  The tender Labours the compliant Cares  The Gods I thought revers'd their hard Decree  And  Phoenix  felt a Father's Joys in thee  Thy growing Virtues justify'd my Cares  And promis'd Comfort to my silver Hairs  Now by thy Rage thy fatal Rage resign'd  A cruel Heart ill suits a manly Mind  The Gods the only great and only wise  Are mov'd by Off'rings Vows and Sacrifice  Offending Man their high Compassion wins  And daily Pray'rs attone for daily Sins  Pray'rs  are  Jove  's Daughters of celestial Race  Lame are their Feet and wrinkled is their Face  With humble Mien and with dejected Eyes  Constant they follow

ancient Fact unfold  A great Example drawn from Times of old  Hear what our Fathers were and what their Praise  Who conquer'd their Revenge in former Days  Where  Calydon  on rocky Mountains stands  Once fought th'  Aetolian  and  Curetian  Bands  To guard it those to conquer these advance  And mutual Deaths were dealt with mutual Chance  The silver  Cynthia  bade  Contention  rise  In Vengeance

is always ours  This Night let due Repast refresh our Pow'rs  For Strength consists in Spirits and in Blood  And those are ow'd to gen'rous Wine and Food  But when the rosy Messenger of Day  Strikes the blue Mountains with her golden Ray  Rang'd at the Ships let all our Squadrons shine  In flaming Arms a longextended Line  In the dread Front let great  Atrides  stand  The first in Danger as in high Command  Shouts of Acclaim the list'ning Heroes raise  Then each to Heav'n the due Libations pays  Till Sleep descending o'er the Tents bestows  The grateful Blessings of desir'd Repose  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Ninth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE NINTH BOOK  I  WE have here a new Scene of Action opened the Poet has hitherto given us an Account of what happened by Day only the two following Books relate the Adventures of the Night  It may be thought that  Homer  has crowded a great many Actions into a very short Time In the ninth Book a Council is conven'd an Embassy sent a considerable Time passes in the Speeches and Replies of the Embassadors and  Achilles  In the tenth Book a second Council is call'd after this a Debate is held  Dolon  is intercepted  Diomed  and  Ulysses  enter into the Enemy's Camp kill  Rhesus  and bring away his Horses And all this done in the narrow Compass of one Night  It must therefore be remember'd that the ninth Book takes up the first Part of the Night only that after the first Council was dissolv'd there pass'd some time before the second was summon'd as appears by the Leaders being awakened by  Menelaus  So that it was almost Morning before  Diomed  and  Ulysses  set out upon their Design which is very evident from the Words of  Ulysses  Book ℣  So that altho' a great many Incidents are introduc'd yet every thing might easily have been perform'd in the allotted Time  II  VERSE  From  Thracia  's Shore    Homer  has been suppos'd by  Eratosthenes  and others to have been guilty of an Error in saying that  Zephyrus  or the West Wind blows from  Thrace  whereas in Truth it blows toward it But the Poet speaks so either because it is fabled to be the Rendezvous of all the Winds or with respect to the particular Situation of  Troy  and the  Aegean  Sea Either of these Replies are sufficient to solve that Objection  The particular Parts of this Comparison agree admirably with the Design of  Homer  to express the Distraction of the  Greeks  the two Winds representing the different Opinions of the Armies one Part of which were inclin'd to return the other to stay  Eustathius  III  VERSE  But bid in Silence    The Reason why  Agamemnon  commands his Heralds to summon the Leaders in Silence is for fear the Enemy should discover their Consternation by reason of their Nearness or perceive what their Designs were in this Extremity  Eustathius  IV  VERSE Agamemnon  's Speech    The Criticks are divided in their Opinion whether this Speech which is word for word the same with that he makes in  Lib  be only a Feint to try the Army as it is there or the real Sentiments of the General  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  explains it as the former with whom Madam  Dacier  concurs she thinks they must be both counterfeit because they are both the same and believes  Homer  would have varied them had the Design been different She takes no notice that  Eustathius  is of the contrary  Opinion as is also Monsieur  de la Motte  who argues as if he had read him  "  Agamemnon  says he in the second Iliad thought himself assured of Victory from the Dream which  Jupiter  had sent to him and in that Confidence was desirous to bring the  Greeks  to a Battel But in the ninth Book his Circumstances are changed he is in the utmost Distress and Despair upon his Defeat and therefore his Proposal to raise the Siege is in all Probability sincere If  Homer  had intended we should think otherwise he would have told us so as he did on the former Occasion and some of the Officers would have suspected a Feint the rather because they had been impos'd upon by the same Speech before But none of them suspect him at all  Diomed  thinks him so much in earnest as to reproach his Cowardice  Nestor  applauds  Diomed  's Liberty and  Agamemnon  makes not the least Defence for himself  Dacier  answers that  Homer  had no Occasion to tell us this was counterfeit because the Officers could not but remember it to have been so before and as for the Answers of  Diomed  and  Nestor  they only carry on the same Feint as  Dionysius  has prov'd whose Reasons may be seen in the following Note  I do not pretend to decide upon this Point but which way soever it be I think  Agamemnon  's Design was equally answer'd by repeating the same Speech So that the Repetition at least is not to be blamed in  Homer  What obliged  Agamemnon  to that Feint in the second Book was the Hatred he had incurred in the Army by being the Cause of  Achilles  's Departure this made it but a necessary Precaution in him to try before he came to a Battel whether the  Greeks  were dispos'd to it And it was equally necessary in case the Event should prove unsuccessful to free himself from the Odium of being the occasion of it Therefore when they were now actually defeated to repeat the same Words was the readiest way to put them in mind that he had propos'd the same Advice to them before the Battel and to make it appear unjust that their ill Fortune should be charged upon him See the  th  and  th  Notes on the second Iliad  V  VERSE  The Speech of  Diomed  I shall here translate the Criticism of  Dionysius  on this Passage He asks  "What can be the Drift of  Diomed  when he insults  Agamemnon  in his Griefs and Distresses For what  Diomed  here says seems not only very ill tim'd but inconsistent with his own Opinion and with the Respect he had shewn in the beginning of this very Speech  If I upbraid thee Prince thy Wrath withhold  The Laws of Council bid my Tongue be bold  This is the Introduction of a Man in Temper who is willing to soften and Excuse the Liberty of what is to follow and what Necessity only obliges him to utter But he subjoins a Resentment of the Reproach the King had formerly thrown upon him and tells him that  Jupiter  had given him Power and Dominion without Courage and Virtue These are things which agree but ill together that  Diomed  should upbraid  Agamemnon  in his Adversity with past Injuries after he had endur'd his Reproaches with so much Moderation and had reproved  Sthenelus  so warmly for the contrary Practice in the fourth Book If any one answer that  Diomed  was warranted in this Freedom by the Bravery of his warlike Behaviour since that Reproach he supposes this Hero very ignorant how to demean himself in Prosperity The Truth is this whole Accusation of  Diomed  's is only a Feint to serve the Designs of  Agamemnon  For being desirous to persuade the  Greeks  against their Departure he effects that Design by this counterfeited Anger and License of Speech And seeming to resent that  Agamemnon  should be capable of imagining the Army would return to  Greece  he artificially makes use of these Reproaches to cover his Argument This is farther confirm'd by what follows when he bids  Agamemnon  return if he pleases and affirms that the  Grecians  will stay without him Nay he carries the Matter so  far as to boast that if all the rest should depart himself and  Sthenelus  alone would continue the War which would be extremely childish and absurd in any other View than this  VI  VERSE  The Speech of  Nestor  "  Nestor  continues  Dionysius  seconds the Oration of  Diomed  We shall perceive the Artifice of his Discourse if we reflect to how little Purpose it would be without this Design He praises  Diomed  for what he has said but does it not without declaring that he had not spoken fully to the Purpose and fallen short in some Points which he ascribes to his Youth and promises to supply them Then after a long Preamble when he has turn'd himself several ways as if he was sporting in a new and uncommon Vein of Oratory he concludes by ordering the Watch to their Stations and advising  Agamemnon  to invite the Elders of the Army to a Supper there out of many Counsels to chuse the best All this at first Sight appears absurd But we must know that  Nestor  too speaks in Figure  Diomed  seems to quarrel with  Agamemnon  purely to gratify him but  Nestor  praises his Liberty of Speech as it were to vindicate a real Quarrel with the King The End of all this is only to move  Agamemnon  to supplicate  Achilles  and to that End he so much commends the young Man's Freedom In proposing to call a Council only of the eldest he consults the Dignity of  Agamemnon  that he might not be expos'd to make this Condescension before the younger Officers And he concludes by an artful Inference of the absolute Necessity of applying to  Achilles  from the present Posture of their Affairs  See what a Blaze from hostile Tents aspires  How near our Fleets approach the  Trojan  Fires  This is all  Nestor  says at this time before the general Assembly of the  Greeks  but in his next Speech when the Elders only are present he explains the whole Matter at  large and openly declares that they must have Recourse to  Achilles  Dion Hal    p    Plutarch de aud Poetis  takes notice of this Piece of Decorum in  Nestor  who when he intended to move for a Mediation with  Achilles  chose not to do it in publick but propos'd a private Meeting of the Chiefs to that End If what these two great Authors have said be consider'd there will be no room for the trivial Objection some Moderns have made to this Proposal of  Nestor  's as if in the present Distress he did no more than impertinently advise them to go to Supper  VII  VERSE  They gave thee Sceptres  c  This is the Language of a brave Man to affirm and say boldly that Courage is above Scepters and Crowns Scepters and Crowns were indeed in former Times not hereditary but the Recompence of Valour With what Art and Haughtiness  Diomed  sets himself indirectly above  Agamemnon Eustathius  VIII  VERSE  And nearest to the Main    There is a secret Stroke of Satyr in these Words  Diomed  tells the King that his Squadron lies next the Sea insinuating that they were the most distant from the Battel and readiest for Flight  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  God bade us fight and 'twas with God we came    This is literal from the  Greek  and therein may be seen the Style of holy Scripture where 'tis said that they  come with God  or that they are not come  without God  meaning that they did not come without his Order  Numquid sine Domino ascendi in terram istam  says  Rabshekah  to  Hezekiah  in  Isaiah  ℣ This Passage seems to be very beautiful  Homer  adds it to shew that the Valour of  Diomed  which puts him upon remaining alone with  Sthenelus  when all the  Greeks  were gone is not a Rash and mad Boldness but a reasonable one and founded on the Promises of God himself who cannot lye  Dacier  X  VERSE  Oh truly great    Nestor  could do no less than commend  Diomed  's Valour he had lately been a Witness of it when he was preserv'd from falling into the Enemy's Hands till he was rescu'd by  Diomed Eustathius  XI  VERSE  Curs'd is the Man    Nestor  says the same Author very artfully brings in these Words as a general Maxim in order to dispose  Agamemnon  to a Reconciliation with  Achilles  He delivers it in general Terms and leaves the King to make the Application This Passage is translated with Liberty for the Original comprizes a great deal in a very few Words      it will be proper to give a particular Explication of each of these  says  Eustathius  signifies one who is a Vagabond or Foreigner The  Athenians  kept a Register in which all that were born were enroll'd whence it easily appear'd who were Citizens or not  therefore signifies one who is depriv'd of the Privilege of a Citizen  is one that had forfeited all Title to be protected by the Laws of his Country  one that has no Habitation or rather one that was not permitted to partake of any Family Sacrifice For  is a Family Goddess and  Jupiter  sometimes is called    There is a sort of Gradation in these Words  signifies a Man that has lost the Privileges of his Country  those of his own Tribe and  those of his own Family  XII  VERSE  Between the Trench and Wall    It is almost impossible to make such Particularities as these appear with any tolerable Elegance in Poetry And as they cannot be rais'd so neither must they be omitted This particular Space here mention'd between the Trench and Wall is what we must carry in our Mind thro' this and the following Book Otherwise we shall be at a loss to know the exact Scene of the Actions and Councils that follow  XIII  VERSE  The Fires they light    They lighted up a Fire that they might not seem to be under any Consternation but to be upon their Guard against any Alarm  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  When Thirst and Hunger ceast    The Conduct of  Homer  in this Place is very remarkable he does not fall into a long Description of the Entertainment but complies with the Exigence of Affairs and passes on to the Consultation  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  And make the Wisdom thine    Eustathius  thought that  Homer  said this because in Councils as in the Army all is attributed to the Princes and the whole Honour ascrib'd to them but this is by no means  Homer  's Thought What he here says is a Maxim drawn from profoundest Philosophy That which often does Men the most harm is Envy and the Shame of yielding to Advice which proceeds from others There is more Greatness and Capacity in following good Advice than in proposing it by executing it we render it our own and we ravish even the Property of it from its Author and  Eustathius  seems to incline to this Thought when  he afterwards says  Homer  makes him that follows good Advice equal to him that gives it but he has not fully express'd himself  Dacier  XVI  VERSE  At once my present Judgment and my past    Nestor  here by the word  means the Advice he gave at the time of the Quarrel in the first Book He says as it was his Opinion then that  Agamemnon  ought not to disgrace  Achilles  so after the maturest Deliberation he finds no Reason to alter it  Nestor  here launches out into the Praises of  Achilles  which is a secret Argument to induce  Agamemnon  to regain his Friendship by shewing the Importance of it  Eustathius  XVII  VERSE  This wondrous Hero    It is remarkable that  Agamemnon  here never uses the Name of  Achilles  tho' he is resolv'd to court his Friendship yet he cannot bear the mention of his Name The Impression which the Dissention made is not yet worn off tho' he expatiates in Commendation of his Valour  Eustathius  XVIII  VERSE  If Gifts immense his mighty Soul can bow    The Poet says  Eustathius  makes a wise Choice of the Gifts that are to be proffer'd to  Achilles  Had he been ambitious of Wealth there are golden Tripods and ten Talents of Gold to bribe his Resentment If he had been addicted to the Fair Sex there was a King's Daughter and seven fair Captives to win his Favour Or if he had been ambitious of Greatness there were seven wealthy Cities and a Kingly Power to court him to a Reconciliation But he takes this way to shew us that his Anger was stronger than all his other Passions It is farther observable that  Agamemnon  promises these Presents at three different times first at this Instant  secondly on the taking of  Troy  and lastly after their Return to  Greece  This Division in some degree multiplies them  Dacier  XIX  VERSE  Ten weighty Talents    The ancient Criticks have blamed one of the Verses in the Enumeration of these Presents as not sufficiently flowing and harmonious the Pause is ill placed and one word does not fall easily into the other This will appear very plain if we compare it with a more numerous Verse  The Ear immediately perceives the Musick of the former Line every Syllable glides smoothly away without offending the Ear with any such Roughness as is found in the second The first runs as swiftly as the Wind which it describes but the latter is a broken interrupted uneven Verse But it is certainly pardonable in this Place where the Musick of Poetry is not necessary the Mind is entirely taken up in learning what Presents  Agamemnon  intended to make  Achilles  and is not at leisure to regard the Ornaments of Versification and even those Pauses are not without their Beauties as they would of Necessity cause a Stop in the Delivery and so give time for each Particular to sink into the Mind of  Achilles Eustathius  XX  VERSE  Sev'n sacred Tripods    There were two kinds of Tripods in the one they used to boil Water the other was entirely for Shew to mix Wine and Water in says  Athenaeus  the first were called  or Cauldrons for common Use and made to bear the Fire the other were  and made chiefly for Ornament It may be ask'd why this could be a proper Present for  Achilles  who was a martial Man and  regarded nothing but Arms It may be answer'd that these Presents were very well suited to the Person to whom they were sent as Tripods in ancient Days were the usual Prizes in Games and they were given by  Achilles  himself in those which he exhibited in Honour of  Patroclus  the same may be said of the female Captives which are also among the Prizes in the Games of  Patroclus Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  Twelve Steeds unmatch'd    From hence it is evident that Games us'd to be celebrated in the  Grecian  Army during the Time of War perhaps in Honour of the deceas'd Heroes For had  Agamemnon  sent  Achilles  Horses that had been victorious before the beginning of the  Trojan  War they would by this time have been too old to be of any Value  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE Laodice  and  Iphigenia c  These are the Names of  Agamemnon  's Daughters among which we do not find  Electra  But some affirm says  Eustathius  that  Laodice  and  Electra  are the same as  Iphianassa  is the same with  Iphigenia  and she was called so either by way of Sirname or by reason of her Complexion which was    flava  or by way of Derision  quasi  because she was an old Maid as appears from  Euripides  who says that she remain'd long a Virgin  And in  Sophocles  she says of herself    I wander a disconsolate unmarry'd Virgin  which shews that it was ever look'd upon as a Disgrace to continue long so  XXIII  VERSE  I ask no PresentsMy self will give the Dow'r    For in  Greece  the Bridegroom before he marry'd was obliged to make two Presents one to his betroth'd Wife and the other to his Father in Law This Custom is very ancient it was practised by the  Hebrews  in the time of the Patriarchs  Abraham  's Servant gave Necklaces and Earrings to  Rebecca  whom he demanded for  Isaac Genesis    Shechem  Son of  Hamor  says to  Jacob  and his Sons whose Sister he was desirous to espouse  "Ask me never so much Dowry and Gifts  Genesis  For the Dowry was for the Daughter This Present serv'd for her Dowry and the other Presents were for the Father In the first Book of  Samuel    Saul  makes them say to  David  who by reason of his Poverty said he could not be Son in Law to the King  "The King desireth not any Dowry  And in the two last Passages we see the Presents were commonly regulated by the Father of the Bride There is no mention in  Homer  of any Present made to the Father but only of that which was given to the married Daughter which was call'd  The Dowry which the Father gave to his Daughter was called  Wherefore  Agamemnon  says here    Dacier  XXIV  VERSE Pluto  the grizly God who never spares    The meaning of this may be gather'd from  Aeschylus  cited here by  Eustathius  Death is the only God who is not mov'd by Offerings whom you cannot conquer by Sacrifices and Oblations and therefore he is the only God to whom no Altar is erected and no Hymns are sung  XXV  VERSE  Let  Phoenix  lead    How comes it to pass that  Phoenix  is in the  Grecian  Camp when undoubtedly he retir'd with his Pupil  Achilles Eustathius  says the Ancients conjectur'd that he came to the Camp to see the last Battel and indeed nothing is more natural to imagine than that  Achilles  would be impatient to know the Event of the Day when he was himself absent from the Fight and as his Revenge and Glory were to be satisfied by the ill Success of the  Grecians  It is highly probable that he sent  Phoenix  to enquire after it  Eustathius  farther observes  Phoenix  was not an Embassador but only the Conductor of the Embassy This is evident from the Words themselves which are all along deliver'd in the dual Number and farther from  Achilles  's requiring  Phoenix  to stay with him when the other two departed  XXVI  VERSE  Great  Ajax  next and  Ithacus  the sage    The Choice of these Persons is made with a great deal of Judgment  Achilles  could not but reverence the venerable  Phoenix  his Guardian and Tutor  Ajax  and  Ulysses  had been disgrac'd in the first Book Line as well as he and were therefore Instances of that Forgiveness they came to ask besides it was the greatest Honour that could be done to  Achilles  to send the most worthy Personages in the Army to him  Ulysses  was inferior to none in Eloquence but to  Nestor Ajax  was second to none in Valour but to  Achilles  Ajax  might have an Influence over him as a Relation by Descent from  Aeacus Ulysses  as an Orator To these are join'd  Hodius  and  Eurybates  two Heralds which tho it were not customary yet was necessary in this Place both to certify  Achilles  that this Embassage was the Act of  Agamemnon  himself and also to make these Persons who had been Witnesses before God and Man of the Wrong done to  Achilles  in respect to  Briseis  Witnesses also of the Satisfaction given him  Eustathius  XXVII  VERSE  Much he advis'd them all  Ulysses  most    There is a great Propriety in representing  Nestor  as so particularly applying himself on this Occasion to  Ulysses  Tho' he of all Men had the least need of his Instructions yet it is highly natural for one wise Man to talk most to another  XXVIII  VERSE  Pleas'd with the solemn Harp's harmonious Sound    "  Homer  says  Plutarch  to prove what an excellent Use may be made of Musick feign'd  Achilles  to compose by this means the Wrath he had conceiv'd against  Agamemnon  He sung to his Harp the noble Actions of the Valiant and the Atchievements of Heroes and Demigods a Subject worthy of  Achilles Homer  moreover teaches us in this Fiction the proper Season for Musick when a Man is at leisure and unemploy'd in greater Affairs For  Achilles  so valorous as he was had retir'd from Action thro' his Displeasure to  Agamemnon  And nothing was better suited to the martial Disposition of this Hero than these heroick Songs that prepared him for the Deeds and Toils he afterwards undertook by the Celebration of the like in those who had gone before him Such was the ancient Musick and to such Purposes it was apply'd  Plut of Musick  The same Author relates in the Life of  Alexander  that when the Lyre of  Paris  was offer'd to that Prince he made answer  "He had little Value for it but much desired that of  Achilles  on which he sung the Actions of Heroes in former Times  XXIX  VERSE  Princes all hail    This short Speech is wonderfully proper to the Occasion and to the Temper of the Speaker One is under a great Expectation of what  Achilles  will say at the Sight of these Heroes and I know nothing in Nature that could satisfy it but the very thing he here accosts them with  XXX  VERSE  Mix purer Wine    The Meaning of this word  is very dubious some say it signifies warm Wine from    ferveo  According to  Aristotle  it is an Adverb and implies to mix Wine  quickly  And others think it signifies pure Wine In this last Sense  Herodotus  uses it    Which in  English  is thus  "When the  Spartans  have an Inclination to drink their Wine pure and not diluted they propose to drink after the Manner of the  Scythians  some of whom coming Embassadors to  Sparta  taught  Cleomenes  to drink his Wine unmix'd  I think this Sense of the Word is most natural and  Achilles  might give this particular Order not to dilute the Wine so much as usually because the Embassadors who were brave Men might be suppos'd to be much fatigu'd in the late Battel and to want a more than usual Refreshment  Eustathius  See  Plutarch Symp l    c    XXXI  VERSE Patroclus  o'er the blazing Fire  c  The Reader must not expect to find much Beauty in such Descriptions as these they give us an exact Account of the Simplicity of that Age which for all we know might be a Part of  Homer's  Design there being no doubt a considerable Change of Customs in  Greece  from the Time of the  Trojan  War to those wherein our Author lived and it seem'd demanded of him to omit nothing that might give the  Greeks  an Idea of the Manners of their Predecessors But however that Matter stood it should methinks be a Pleasure to a modern Reader to see how such mighty Men whose Actions have surviv'd their Persons three thousand Years liv'd in the earliest Ages  of the World The Embassadors found this Hero says  Eustathius  without any Attendants he had no Ushers or Waiters to introduce them no servile Parasites about him The latter Ages degenerated into these Pieces of State and Pageantry  The Supper also is describ'd with an equal Simplicity three Princes are busied in preparing it and they who made the greatest Figure in the Field of Battel thought it no Disparagement to prepare their own Repast The Objections some have made that  Homer  's Gods and Heroes do every thing for themselves as if several of those Offices were unworthy of them proceeds from the corrupt Idea of modern Luxury and Grandeur Whereas in truth it is rather a Weakness and Imperfection to stand in need of the Assistance and Ministry of others But however it be methinks those of the nicest Taste might relish this Entertainment of  Homer  's when they consider these great Men as Soldiers in a Camp in whom the least Appearance of Luxury would have been a Crime  XXXII  VERSE Patroclus  o'er the blazing Fire    Madam  Dacier  's general Note on this Passage deserves to be transcribed  "  Homer  says she is in the right not to avoid these Descriptions because nothing can properly be called vulgar which is drawn from the Manner and Usages of Persons of the first Dignity and also because in his Tongue even the Terms of Cookery are so noble and of so agreeable a Sound and he likewise knows how to place them so well as to extract a perfect Harmony from them So that he may be said to be as excellent a Poet when he describes these small Matters as when he treats of the greatest Subjects 'Tis not so either with our Manners or our Language Cookery is left to Servants and all its Terms so low and disagreeable even in the Sound that nothing can be made of them that has not some Taint of their Meanness This great Disadvantage made me at first think of abridging this Preparation of the Repast but when I had well consider'd  it I was resolv'd to preserve and give  Homer  as he is without retrenching any thing from the Simplicity of the heroick Manners I do not write to enter the List against  Homer  I will dispute nothing with him my Design is only to give an Idea of him and to make him be understood The Reader will therefore forgive me if this Description has none of its original Graces  XXXIII  VERSE  In a Brazen Vase    The word  signifies the Vessel and not the Meat itself as  Euphorion  conjectured giving it as a Reason that  Homer  makes no mention of boiled Meat But this does not hinder but that the Meat might be parboil'd in the Vessel to make it roast the sooner This with some other Notes on the Particulars of this Passage belong to  Eustathius  and Madam  Dacier  ought not to have taken to herself the Merit of his Explanations  XXXIV  VERSE  And sprinkles sacred Salt    Many Reasons are given why Salt is called sacred or divine but the best is because it preserves things incorrupt and keeps them from Dissolution  "So Thunder says  Plutarch Sympos l    qu  is called divine because Bodies struck with Thunder will not putrify besides Generation is divine because God is the Principle of all things and Salt is most operative in Generation  Lycophron  calls it  For this Reason  Venus  was feign'd by the Poets to spring from the Sea  XXXV  VERSE  To  Phoenix Ajax  gave the Sign    Ajax  who was a rough Soldier and no Orator is impatient to have the Business over He makes a Sign to  Phoenix  to begin but  Ulysses  prevents him Perhaps  Ulysses  might flatter himself that his Oratory  would prevail upon  Achilles  and so obtain the Honour of making the Reconciliation himself Or if he were repuls'd there yet remain'd a second and third Resource in  Ajax  and  Phoenix  who might renew the Attempt and endeavour to shake his Resolution There would still be some hopes of Success as one of these was his Guardian the other his Relation One may farther add to these Reasons of  Eustathius  that it would have been improper for  Phoenix  to have spoken first since he was not an Embassador and therefore  Ulysses  was the fitter Person as being impower'd by that Function to make an Offer of the Presents in the Name of the King  XXXVI  VERSE  Health to  Achilles  There are no Discourses in the Iliad better placed better tim'd or that give a greater Idea of  Homer  's Genius than these of the Embassadors to  Achilles  These Speeches are not only necessarily demanded by the Occasion but disposed with Art and in such an Order as raises more and more the Pleasure of the Reader  Ulysses  speaks the first the Character of whose Discourse is a welladdress'd Eloquence so the Mind is agreeably engag'd by the Choice of his Reasons and Applications  Achilles  replies with a magnanimous Freedom whereby the Mind is elevated with the Sentiments of the Hero  Phoenix  discourses in a manner touching and pathetick whereby the Heart is moved and  Ajax  concludes with a generous Disdain that leaves the Soul of the Reader inflamed This Order undoubtedly denotes a great Poet who knows how to command Attention as he pleases by the Arrangement of his Matter and I believe it it not possible to propose a better Model for the happy Disposition of a Subject These Words are Monsieur  de la Motte  's and no Testimony can be more glorious to  Homer  than this which comes from the Mouth of an Enemy  XXXVII  VERSE  Not those more honour'd whom  Atrides  feasts    I must just mention  Dacier  's Observation With what Cunning  Ulysses  here slides in the odious Name of  Agamemnon  as he praises  Achilles  that the Ear of this impetuous Man might be familiariz'd to that Name  XXXVIII  VERSE  He waits but for the Morn to sink in Flame The Ships the  Greeks c  There is a Circumstance in the Original which I have omitted for fear of being too particular in an Oration of this Warmth and Importance but as it preserves a Piece of Antiquity I must not forget it here He says that  Hector  will not only fire the Fleet but bear off the  Statues of the Gods  which were carv'd on the Prows of the Vessels These were hung up in the Temples as a Monument of Victory according to the Custom of those Times  XXXIX  VERSE  But hear me while I number o'er The proffer'd Presents    Monsieur  de la Motte  finds fault with  Homer  for making  Ulysses  in this Place repeat all the Offers of  Agamemnon  to  Achilles  Not to answer that it was but necessary to make known to  Achilles  all the Proposals or that this distinct Enumeration serv'd the more to move him I think one may appeal to any Person of common Taste whether the solemn Recital of these Circumstances does not please him more than the simple Narration could have done which Monsieur  de la Motte  would have put in its stead  Ulysses made all the Offers  Agamemnon  had commission'd him  XL  VERSE Achilles  's Speech    Nothing is more remarkable than the Conduct of  Homer  in this Speech of  Achilles  He begins with some degree of Coolness as in respect to the Embassadors whose Persons he esteem'd yet even there his Temper just shews itself in the Insinuation that  Ulysses  had dealt artfully with him which in two Periods rises into an open Detestation of all Artifice He then falls into a sullen Declaration of his Resolves and a more sedate Representation of his past Services but warms as he goes on and every Minute he but names his Wrongs flies out into Extravagance His Rage awaken'd by that Injury is like a Fire blown by a Wind that sinks and rises by fits but keeps continually burning and blazes but the more for those Intermissions  XLI  VERSE  As the bold Bird  c  This Simile says  La Motte  must be allow'd to be just but was not fit to be spoken in a Passion One may answer that the Tenderness of the Comparison renders it no way the less proper to a Man in a Passion it being natural enough the more one is disgusted at present the more to recollect the Kindness we have formerly shewn to those who are ungrateful  Eustathius  observes that so soft as the Simile seems it has nevertheless its  fiertè  for  Achilles  herein expresses his Contempt for the  Greeks  as a weak defenceless People who must have perished if he had not preserved them And indeed if we consider what is said in the preceding Note it will appear that the Passion of  Achilles  ought not as yet to be at the Height  XLII  VERSE  I sack'd twelve ample Cities    Eustathius  says that the Anger of  Achilles  not only throws him into Tautology but also into Ambiguity For says he these Words  may either signify that he destroy'd twelve Cities with his Ships or barely Cities with twelve Ships But  Eustathius  in this Place is like many other Commentators who can see a Meaning in a Sentence that never enter'd into the Thoughts of an Author It is not easy to conceive how  Achilles  could have express'd himself more clearly There is no doubt but  agrees with the same word that  does in the following Line which is certainly  and there is a manifest Enumeration of the Places he had conquer'd by Sea and by Land  XLIII  VERSE  The Wife whom Choice and Passion both approve Sure ev'ry wise and worthy Man will love    The Argument of  Achilles  in this Place is very apropos with Reference to the Case of  Agamemnon  If I translated it verbatim I must say in plain  English Every honest Man loves his Wife  Thus  Homer  has made this rash this fiery Soldier govern'd by his Passions and in the Rage of Youth bear Testimony to his own Respect for the Ladies But it seems  Poltis  King of  Thrace  was of another Opinion who would have parted with two Wives out of pure Goodnature to two meer Strangers as I have met with the Story somewhere in  Plutarch  When the  Greeks  were raising Forces against  Troy  they sent Embassadors to this  Poltis  to desire his Assistance He enquir'd the Cause of the War and was told it was the Injury  Paris  had done  Menelaus  in taking his Wife from him  "If that be all said the good King let me accomodate the Difference Indeed it is not just the  Greek  Prince should lose a Wife and on the other side it is pity the  Trojan  should want one Now I have two Wives and to prevent all this Mischief I'll send one of them to  Menelaus  and the other to  Paris  It is a shame this Story is so little known and that poor  Poltis  yet remains uncelebrated I cannot but recommend him to the modern Poets  XLIV  VERSE  Your King  Ulysses  may consult with you    Achilles  still remembers what  Agamemnon  said to him when they quarrel'd  Other brave Warriors will be left behind to follow me in Battel  as we have seen in the first Book He answers here without either sparing  Ajax  or  Ulysses  as much his Friends as they are they have their Share in this Stroke of Raillery  Eustathius  XLV  VERSE  Has he not Walls    This is a bitter Satyr says  Eustathius  against  Agamemnon  as if his only Deeds were the making of this Wall this Ditch these Pallisades to defend himself against those whom he came to besiege There was no need of these Retrenchments whilst  Achilles  fought But as  Dacier  observes this Satyr does not affect  Agamemnon  only but  Nestor  too who had advis'd the making of these Retrenchments and who had said in the second Book  If there are a few who separate themselves from the rest of the Army let them stay and perish  ℣ Probably this had been reported to  Achilles  and that Hero revenges himself here by mocking these Retrenchments  XLVI  VERSE Pthia  the third Day hence  c  Monsieur  de la Motte  thinks the mention of these minute Circumstances not to agree with the passionate Character of the Speaker that  he shall arrive at  Pthia  in three Days  that  he shall find there all the Riches he left when he came to the Siege  and that  he shall carry other Treasures home Dacier  answers that we need only consider the present Situation of  Achilles  and his Cause of Complaint against  Agamemnon  and we shall be satisfied here is nothing but what is exactly agreeable to the Occasion To convince the Embassadors that he will return home  he instances the Easiness of doing it in the Space of three Days  Agamemnon  had injur'd him in the Point of Booty he therefore declares he had sufficient Treasures at home and that he will carry off Spoils enough and Women enough to make amends for those that Prince had ravish'd from him Every one of these Particulars marks his Passion and Resentment  XLVII  VERSE  One only valu'd Gift your Tyrant gave    The Injury which  Agamemnon  offer'd to  Achilles  is still uppermost in his Thoughts he has but just dismiss'd it and now returns to it again These Repetitions are far from being Faults in  Achilles  's Wrath whose Anger is perpetually breaking out upon the same Injury  XLVIII  VERSE  Kings of such a kind Stand but as Slaves before a noble Mind    The Words in the  Greek  are  I despise him as a Carian  The  Carians  were People of  Boeotia  the first that sold their Valour and were ready to fight for any that gave them their Pay This was look'd upon as the vilest of Actions in those heroical Ages I think there is at present but one Nation in the World distinguish'd for this Practice who are ready to prostitute their Hands to kill for the highest Bidder  Eustathius  endeavours to give many other Solutions of this Place as that  may be mistaken for  from    pediculus  but this is too mean and trivial to be  Homer  's Sentiment There is more Probability that it comes from    and so  by the Change of the  Eta  into  Alpha  and then the Meaning will be that  Achilles  hates him as much as Hell or Death agreeable to what he had said a little before  VERSE  Not all proud  Thebes c  These several Circumstances concerning  Thebes  are thought by some not to suit with that Emotion with which  Achilles  here is suppos'd to speak but the contrary will appear true if we reflect that nothing is more usual for Persons transported with Anger than to insist and return to such Particulars as most touch them and that Exaggeration is a Figure extremely natural in Passion  Achilles  therefore by shewing the Greatness of  Thebes  its Wealth and Extent does in Effect but shew the Greatness of his own Soul and of that insuperable Resentment which renders all these Riches tho' the greatest in the World contemptible in his Sight when he compares them with the Indignity his Honour has receiv'd  L  VERSE  Proud  Thebes'  unrival'd Walls  c  "The City which the  Greeks  call  Thebes  the  Aegyptians Heliopolis  says  Diodorus lib    part  was in Circuit a hundred and forty Stadia adorned with stately Buildings magnificent Temples and rich Donations It was not only the most beautiful and noble City of  Aegypt  but of the whole World The Fame of its Wealth and Grandeur was so celebrated in all Parts that the Poet took notice of it in these Words    Tho' others affirm it had not a hundred Gates but several vast Porches to the Temples from whence the City was call'd the  Hundredgated  only as having many Gates Yet it is certain it furnished twenty thousand Chariots of War for there were a hundred Stables along the River  from  Memphis  to  Thebes  towards  Lybia  each of which contain'd two hundred Horses the Ruins whereof are shewn at this Day The Princes from time to time made it their care to beautify and enlarge this City to which none under the Sun was equal in the many and magnificent Treasures of Gold Silver and Ivory with innumerable Colossus's and Obelisques of one entire Stone There were four Temples admirable in Beauty and Greatness the most ancient of which was in Circuit thirteen Stadia and five and forty Cubits in Heighth with a Wall of four and twenty Foot broad The Ornaments and Offerings within were agreeable to this Magnificence both in Value and Workmanship The Fabrick is yet remaining but the Gold Silver Ivory and precious Stones were ransack'd by the  Persians  when  Cambyses  burn'd the Temples of  Aegypt  There were found in the Rubbish above three hundred Talents of Gold and no less than two thousand three hundred of Silver  The same Author proceeds to give many Instances of the Magnificence of this great City The Description of the Sepulchres of their Kings and particularly that of  Osymanduas  is perfectly astonishing to which I refer the Reader  Strabo  farther informs us that the Kings of  Thebes  extended their Conquests as far as  Scythia Bactria  and  India  LI  VERSE  Not all  Apollo  's  Pythian  Treasures    The Temple of  Apollo  at  Delphos  was the richest Temple in the World by the Offerings which were brought to it from all Parts there were Statues of massy Gold of a human Size Figures of Animals in Gold and several other Treasures A great Sign of its Wealth is that the  Phocians  pillag'd it in the Time of  Philip  the Son of  Amyntas  which gave Occasion to the holy War 'Tis said to have been pillag'd before and that the great Riches of which  Homer  speaks had been carried away  Eustathius  LII  VERSE  The vital Spirit bled Returns no more    Nothing sure could be better imagin'd or more strongly paint  Achilles  's Resentment than this Commendation which  Homer  puts into his Mouth of a long and peaceable Life That Hero whose very Soul was possessed with Love of Glory and who prefer'd it to Life itself lets his Anger prevail over this his darling Passion He despises even Glory when he cannot obtain that and enjoy his Revenge at the same time and rather than lay this aside becomes the very Reverse of himself  LIII  VERSE  My Fates long since by  Thetis  were disclos'd    It was very necessary for  Homer  to put the Reader more than once in mind of this Piece of  Achilles  's Story There is a Remark of Monsieur  de la Motte  which deserves to be transcribed entire on this Occasion  "The Generality of People who do not know  Achilles  by the Iliad and who upon a most noted Fable conceive him invulnerable all but in the Heel find it ridiculous that he should be placed at the Head of Heroes so true it is that the Idea of Valour implies it always from Danger  "Should a Giant well arm'd fight against a Legion of Children whatever Slaughter he should make the Pity any one would have for them would not turn at all to any Admiration of him and the more he should applaud his own Courage the more one would be offended at his Pride  "  Achilles  had been in this Case if  Homer  besides all the Superiority of Strength he has given him had not found the Art of putting likewise his Greatness of Soul out of all Suspicion  "He has perfectly well succeeded in feigning that  Achilles  before his setting out to the  Trojan  War was sure of meeting his Death The Destinies had proposed to him by the  Mouth of  Thetis  the Alternative of a long and happy but obscure Life if he stay'd in his own State or of a short but glorious one if he embrac'd the Vengeance of the  Greeks  He wishes for Glory in Contempt of Death and thus all his Actions all his Motions are so many Proofs of his Courage he runs in hastening his Exploits to a Death which he knows infallibly attends him what does it avail him that he routs every thing almost without Resistance It is still true that he every Moment encounters and faces the Sentence of his Destiny and that he devotes himself generously for Glory  Homer  was so sensible that this Idea must force a Concern for Hero that he scatters it throughout his Poem to the end that the Reader having it always in view may esteem  Achilles  even for what he performs without the least Danger  LIV  VERSE  How shall thy Friend thy  Phoenix  stay behind    This is a strong Argument to persuade  Achilles  to stay but dress'd up in the utmost Tenderness the venerable old Man rises with Tears in his Eyes and speaks the Language of Affection He tells him that he would not be left behind him tho' the Gods would free him from the Burthen of old Age and restore him to his Youth But in the midst of so much Fondness he couches a powerful Argument to persuade him not to return home by adding that his Father sent him to be his Guide and Guardian  Phoenix  ought not therefore to follow the Inclinations of  Achilles  but  Achilles  the Directions of  Phoenix Eustathius  "The Art of this Speech of  Phoenix  says  Dionysius    lib  consists in his seeming to agree with all that  Achilles  had said  Achilles  he sees will depart and he must go along with him but in assigning the Reasons why he must go with him he proves that  Achilles  ought not to depart And thus while he seems only to shew his Love to his Pupil in his Inability to stay behind him he indeed challenges the other's Gratitude for the Benefits he had confer'd upon him in his Infancy and  Education At the same time that he moves  Achilles  he gratifies  Agamemnon  and that this was the real Design which he disguised in that manner we are inform'd by  Achilles  himself in the Reply he makes For  Homer  and all the Authors that treat of this Figure generally contrive it so that the Answers made to these kind of Speeches discover all the Art and Structure of them  Achilles  therefore asks him  Is it for him these Tears are taught to flow  For him these Sorrows for my mortal Foe  You see the Scholar reveals the Art and Dissimulation of his Master and as  Phoenix  had recounted the Benefits done him he takes off that Expostulation by promising to divide his Empire with him as may be seen in the same Answer  LV  VERSE  He sent thee early to th'  Achaian  Host    Achilles  says  Eustathius  according to some of the Ancients was but twelve Years old when he went to the Wars of  Troy    and it may be gather'd from what the Poet here relates of the Education of  Achilles  under  Phoenix  that the Fable of his being tutor'd by  Chiron  was the Invention of latter Ages and unknown to  Homer  Mr  Bayle  in his Article of  Achilles  has very well proved this He might indeed as he grew up have learn'd Musick and Physick of  Chiron  without having him formally as his Tutor for it is plain from this Speech that he was put under the Direction of  Phoenix  as his Governor in Morality when his Father sent him along with him to the Siege of  Troy  LVI  VERSE  My Father faithless to my Mother's Arms  c  Homer  has been blamed for introducing two long Stories into  this Speech of  Phoenix  this concerning himself is said not to be in the proper Place and what  Achilles  must needs have heard over and over It also gives say they a very ill Impression of  Phoenix  himself and makes him appear a very unfit Person to be a Teacher of Morality to the young Hero It is answer'd that tho'  Achilles  might have known the Story before in general 'tis proboble  Phoenix  had not till now so pressing an Occasion to make him discover the Excess his Fury had transported him to in attempting the Life of his own Father The whole Story tends to represent the dreadful Effects of Passion and I cannot but think the Example is the more forcible as it is drawn from his own Experience  LVII  VERSE  To win the Damsel    The Counsel that this Mother gives to her Son  Phoenix  is the same that  Achitophel  gave to  Absolom  to hinder him from ever being reconcil'd to  David Et ait Achitophel ad Absolom ingredere ad concubinos patris tui quas dimisit ad custodiendam domum ut cum audierit omnis Israel quod foedaveris patrem tuum roborentur tecum manus eorum  Sam  Dacier  LVIII  VERSE  Prevent my Sire    This Decency of  Homer  is worthy Observation who to remove all the disagreeable Ideas which might proceed from this Intrigue of  Phoenix  with his Father's Mistress took care to give us to understand in one single word that  Amyntor  had no share in her Affections which makes the Action of  Phoenix  the more excusable He does it only in Obedience to his Mother in order to reclaim his Father and oblige him to live like her Husband Besides his Father had yet no Commerce with this Mistress to whose Love he pretended Had it been otherwise and had  Phoenix  committed this sort of Incest  Homer  would neither have presented this Image to his Reader nor  Peleus  chosen  Phoenix  to be Governor to  Achilles Dacier  LIX  VERSE  Infernal  Jove  The  Greek  is  The Ancients gave the Name of  Jupiter  not only to the God of Heaven but likewise to the God of Hell as is seen here and to the God of the Sea as appears from  Aeschylus  They thereby meant to shew that one sole Deity governed the World and it was to teach the same Truth that the ancient Statuaries made Statues of  Jupiter  which had three Eyes  Priam  had one of them in that manner in the Court of his Palace which was there in  Laomedon  's Time After the taking of  Troy  when the  Greeks  shar'd the Booty it fell to  Sthenelus  's Lot who carry'd it into  Greece Dacier  LX  VERSE  Despair and Grief distract  c  I have taken the Liberty to replace here four Verses which  Aristarchus  had cut out because of the Horror which the Idea gave him of a Son who is going to kill his Father but perhaps  Aristarchus  's Niceness was too great These Verses seem to me necessary and have a very good Effect for  Phoenix  's Aim is to shew  Achilles  that unless we overcome our Wrath we are expos'd to commit the greatest Crimes He was going to kill his own Father  Achilles  in the same manner is going to let his Father  Phoenix  and all the  Greeks  perish if he does not appease his Wrath  Plutarch  relates these four Verses in his Treatise of reading the Poets and adds  "  Aristarchus  frightned at this horrible Crime cut out these Verses but they do very well in this Place and on this Occasion  Phoenix  intending to shew  Achilles  what Wrath is and to what abominable Excesses it hurries Men who do not obey Reason and who refuse to follow the Counsels of those that advise them  These sort of Curtailings from  Homer  often contrary to all Reason gave room to  Lucian  to feign that being in the fortunate Islands he ask'd  Homer  a great many Questions Among other things says he in  his second Book of his true History  "I ask'd him whether he had made all the Verses which had been rejected in his Poem He assur'd me they were all his own which made me laugh at the impertinent and bold Criticisms of  Zenodorus  and  Aristarchus  who had retrench'd them  Dacier  LXI  VERSE  I pass my Watchings o'er thy helpless Years    In the Original of this Place  Phoenix  tells  Achilles  that as he placed him in his Infancy on his Lap  he has often cast up the Wine he had drank upon his Cloaths  I wish I had any Authority to say these Verses were foisted into the Text For tho' the Idea be indeed natural it must be granted to be so very gross as to be utterly unworthy of  Homer  nor do I see any Colour to soften the Meanness of it such Images in any Age or Country must have been too nauseous to be described  LXII  VERSE Pray'rs  are  Jove  's Daughters    Nothing can be more beautiful noble or religious than this divine Allegory We have here Goddesses of  Homer  's Creation he sets before us their Pictures in lively Colours and gives these fancy'd Beings all the Features that resemble Mankind who offer Injuries or have Recourse to Prayers  Prayers are said to be the Daughters of  Jove  because it is he who teaches Man to pray They are lame because the Posture of a Suppliant is with his Knee on the Ground They are wrinkled because those that pray have a Countenance of Dejection and Sorrow Their Eyes are turn'd aside because thro' an awful Regard to Heaven they dare not lift them thither They follow  Ate  or  Injury  because nothing but Prayers can attone for the Wrongs that are offer'd by the injurious  Ate  is said to be strong and swift of Foot  c  because injurious Men are swift to do Mischief This is the Explanation of  Eustathius  with whom  Dacier  agrees but when she allows the Circumstance of Lameness to intimate the Custom of  kneeling in Prayer she forgets that this contradicts her own Assertion in one of the Remarks on Iliad where she affirms that no such Custom was used by the  Greeks  And indeed the contrary seems inferred in several Places of  Homer  particularly where  Achilles  says in the  th  Verse of the eleventh Book  The  Greeks  shall stand round his Knees supplicating to him  The Phrases in that Language that signify praying are deriv'd from the Knee only as it was usual to lay hold on the Knee of the Person to whom they supplicated  A modern Author imagines  Ate  to signify  divine Justice  a Notion in which he is single and repugnant to all the Mythologists Besides the whole Context in this Place and the very Application of the Allegory to the present Case of  Achilles  whom he exhorts to be moved by Prayers notwithstanding the Injustice done him by  Agamemnon  makes the contrary evident  LXIII  VERSE  Not  Greece  nor all her Fortunes    Plato  in the third Book of his Republick condemns this Passage and thinks it very wrong that  Phoenix  should say to  Achilles  that if they did not offer him great Presents he would not advise him to be appeas'd but I think there is some Injustice in this Censure and that  Plato  has not rightly enter'd into the Sense of  Phoenix  who does not look upon these Presents on the side of Interest but Honour as a Mark of  Agamemnon  's Repentance and of the Satisfaction he is ready to make wherefore he says that Honour has a mighty Power over great Spirits  Dacier  LXIV  VERSE  Permit not these to sue and sue in vain    In the Original it is  I am pretty confident there is not any manner of speaking like this used throughout all  Homer  nor two Substantives so odly coupled to a Verb as  and  in this Place We may indeed meet with such little Affectations in  OvidAurigam  puriter animaque rotisque Expulit  and the like but the Taste of the Ancients in general was too good for these Fooleries I must have leave to think the Verse    c  an Interpolation the Sense is compleat without it and the latter part of the Line  seems but a Tautology after what is said in the six Verses preceding  LXV  VERSE  Let me my Son an ancient Fact unfold    Phoenix  says  Eustathius  lays down as the Foundation of his Story that great Men in former Ages were always appeas'd by Presents and Entreaties and to confirm this Position he brings  Meleager  as an Instance but it may be objected that  Meleager  was an ill chosen Instance being a Person whom no Entreaties could move The Superstructure of this Story seems not to agree with the Foundation  Eustathius  solves the Difficulty thus  Homer  did not intend to give an Instance of a Hero's Compliance with the Entreaties of his Friends but to shew that they who did not comply were Sufferers themselves in the End So that the Connection of the Story is thus The Heroes of former Times were used always to be won by Presents and Entreaties  Meleager  only was obstinate and suffer'd because he was so  The Length of this Narration cannot be taxed as unseasonable it was at full Leisure in the Tent and in the Night a time of no Action Yet I cannot answer but the Tale may be tedious to a modern Reader I have translated it therefore with all possible Shortness as will appear upon a Comparison The Piece itself is very valuable as it preserves to us a Part of ancient History that had otherwise been entirely lost as  Quintilian  has remark'd The same great Critick commends  Homer  's manner of relating it  Narrare quis significantius potest quam qui Curetum Aetolorumque praelia exponit lib    c    LXVI  VERSE Alcyone  a Name to show  c  It appears says Madam  Dacier  by this Passage and by others already observ'd that the  Greeks  often gave Names as did the  Hebrews  not only with respect to the Circumstances but likewise to the Accidents which happen'd to the Fathers and Mothers of those they named Thus  Cleopatra  is called  Alcyone  from the Lamentations of her Mother I cannot but think this Digression concerning  Idas  and  Marpessa  too long and not very much to the Purpose  LXVII  VERSE  She paints the Horrors of a conquer'd Town  The Heroes slain the Palaces o'erthrown  The Matrons ravish'd the whole Race enslav'd    It is remarkakable with what Art  Homer  here in a few Words sums up the Miseries of a City taken by Assault  It had been unpardonable for  Cleopatra  to have made a long Representation to  Meleager  of these Miseries when every Moment that kept him from the Battel could not be spared It is also to be observed how perfectly the Features of  Meleager  resemble  Achilles  they are both brave Men ambitious of Glory both of them describ'd as giving Victory to their several Armies while they fought and both of them implacable in their Resentment  Eustathius  LXVIII  VERSE Achilles  's Answer to  Phoenix  The Character of  Achilles  is excellently sustain'd in all his Speeches To  Ulysses  he returns a flat Denial and threatens to leave the  Trojan  Shores in the Morning To  Phoenix  he gives a much gentler Answer and begins to mention  Agamemnon  with less Disrespect  After  Ajax  had spoken he seems determined not to depart but yet refuses to bear Arms till it is to defend his own Squadron Thus  Achilles  's Character  is every where of a Piece He begins to yield and not to have done so would not have spoke him a Man to have made him perfectly inexorable had shewn him a Monster Thus the Poet draws the Heat of his Passion cooling by slow Degrees which is very natural To have done otherwise had not been agreeable to  Achilles  's Temper nor the Reader's Expectation to whom it would have been shocking to have seen him passing from the greatest Storm of Anger to a quiet Calmness  Eustathius  LXIX  VERSE  While Life's warm Spirit beats within my Breast    Eustathius  observes here with a great deal of Penetration that these Words of  Achilles  include a sort of Oracle which he does not understand For it sometimes happens that Men full of their Objects say things which besides the Sense natural and plain to every Body include another supernatural which they themselves do not understand and which is understood by those only who have Penetration enough to see thro' the Obscurity of it Thus  Oedipus  often speaks in  Sophocles  and holy Scripture furnishes us with great Examples of Enthusiastick Speeches which have a double Sense Here we manifestly see that  Achilles  in speaking a very simple and common thing foretells without thinking of it that his Abode on that fatal Shore will equal the Course of his Life and consequently that he shall die there and this double Meaning gives a sensible Pleasure to the Reader  Dacier  LXX  VERSE  The Speech of  Ajax  I have before spoken of this short Soldierlike Speech of  Ajax Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  says of it  "that the Person who entreats most and with most Liberty who supplicates most and presses most is  Ajax  It is probable that  Ajax  rises up when he speaks the word  Let us go  He does not vouchsafe to address himself to  Achilles  but turns himself to  Ulysses  and speaks with a martial Eloquence  LXXI  VERSE  The Price of Blood discharg'd    It was the Custom for the Murderer to go into Banishment one Year but if the Relations of the Person murthered were willing the Criminal by paying them a certain Fine might buy off the Exile and remain at home It may not be amiss to observe that    quasi  properly signifies a Mulct paid for Murder  Ajax  sums up this Argument with a great deal of Strength We see says he a Brother forgive the Murder of his Brother a Father that of his Son But  Achilles  will not forgive the Injury offer'd him by taking away one captive Woman  Eustathius  LXXII  VERSE  Revere the Roof and to thy Guests be kind    Eustathius  says there is some Difficulty in the Original of this Place Why should  Ajax  draw an Argument to influence  Achilles  by putting him in mind to reverence his own Habitation The latter Part of the Verse explains the former We says  Ajax  are under your Roof and let that protect us from any ill Usage send us not away from your House with Contempt who came hither as Friends as Supplicants as Embassadors  LXXIII  VERSE  Well hast thon spoke but at the Tyrant's Name My Rage rekindles    We have here the true Picture of an angry Man and nothing can be better imagin'd to heighten  Achilles  's Wrath he owns that Reason would induce him to a Reconciliation but his Anger is too great to listen to Reason He speaks with respect to them but upon mentioning  Agamemnon  he flies into Rage Anger is in nothing more like Madness than that Madmen will talk sensibly enough upon any indifferent Matter but upon the mention of the  Subject that caused their Disorder they fly out into their usual Extravagance  LXXIV  VERSE  Such was his Word    It may be ask'd here why  Ulysses  speaks only of the Answer which  Achilles  made him at first and says nothing of the Disposition to which the Discourses of  Phoenix  and  Ajax  had brought him The Question is easily answer'd it is because  Achilles  is obstinate in his Resentment and that if at length a little mov'd by  Phoenix  and shaken by  Ajax  he seem'd dispos'd to take Arms it is not out of regard to the  Greeks  but only to save his own Squadron when  Hector  after having put the  Greeks  to the Sword shall come to insult it Thus this inflexible Man abates nothing of his Rage It is therefore prudent in  Ulysses  to make this Report to  Agamemnon  to the End that being put out of hopes of the Aid with which he flatter'd himself he may concert with the Leaders of the Army the Measures necessary to save his Fleet and Troops  Eustathius  LXXV  VERSE  Why should we Gifts  c  This Speech is admirably adapted to the Character of  Diomed  every word is animated with a martial Courage and worthy to be deliver'd by a gallant Soldier He advis'd fighting in the beginning of the Book and continues still in that Opinion and he is no more concern'd at the Speech of  Achilles  now than he was at that of  Agamemnon  before  THE TENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The NightAdventure of  Diomed  and  Ulysses  UPON the Refusal of  Achilles  to return to the Army the Distress of  Agamemnon  is describ'd in the most lively manner He takes no Rest that Night but passes thro' the Camp awaking the Leaders and contriving all possible Methods for the publick Safety  Menelaus Nestor Ulysses  and  Diomed  are employ'd in raising the rest of the Captains They call a Council of War and determine to send Scouts into the Enemy's Camp to learn their Posture and discover their Intentions  Diomed  undertakes this hazardous Enterprize and makes choice of  Ulysses  for his Companion In their Passage they surprize  Dolon  whom  Hector  had sent on a like Design to the Camp of the  Grecians  From him they are inform'd of the Situation of the  Trojan  and Auxiliary Forces and particularly of  Rhesus  and the  Thracians  who were lately arrived They pass on with Success kill  Rhesus  with several of his Officers and seize the famous Horses of that Prince with which they return in Triumph to the Camp  The same Night continues the  Scene  lies in the two Camps  THE TENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  ALL Night the Chiefs before their Vessels lay  And lost in Sleep the Labours of the Day  All but the King with various Thoughts opprest  His Country's Cares lay rowling in his Breast  As when by Light'nings  Jove  's Aetherial Pow'r  Foretells the ratling Hail or weighty Show'r  Or sends soft Snows to whiten all the Shore  Or bids the brazen Throat of War to roar  By fits one Flash succeeds as one expires  And Heav'n flames thick with momentary Fires  So bursting frequent from  Atrides  ' Breast  Sighs following Sighs his inward Fears confest  Now o'er the Fields dejected he surveys  From thousand  Trojan  Fires the mounting Blaze  Hears in the passing Wind their Music blow  And marks distinct the Voices of the Foe  Now looking backwards to the Fleet and Coast  Anxious he sorrows for th' endanger'd Host  He rends his Hairs in sacrifice to  Jove  And sues to Him that ever lives above  Inly he groans while Glory and Despair  Divide his Heart and wage a doubtful War  A thousand Cares his lab'ring Breast revolves  To seek sage  Nestor  now the Chief resolves  With him in wholsome Counsels to debate  What yet remains to save th' afflicted State  He rose and first he cast his Mantle round  Next on his Feet the shining Sandals bound  A Lion's yellow Spoils his Back conceal'd  His warlike Hand a pointed Javelin held  Meanwhile his Brother prest with equal Woes  Alike deny'd the Gifts of soft Repose  Laments for  Greece  that in his Cause before  So much had suffer'd and must suffer more  A Leopard's spotted Hide his Shoulders spread  A brazen Helmet glitter'd on his Head  Thus with a Javelin in his Hand he went  To wake  Atrides  in the Royal Tent  Already wak'd  Atrides  he descry'd  His Armour buckling at his Vessel's side  Joyful they met the  Spartan  thus begun  Why puts my Brother his bright Armour on  Sends he some Spy amidst these silent Hours  To try yon' Camp and watch the  Trojan  Pow'rs  But say what Hero shall sustain that Task  Such bold Exploits uncommon Courage ask  Guideless alone through Night's dark Shade to go  And 'midst a hostile Camp explore the Foe  To whom the King In such Distress we stand  No vulgar Counsels our Affairs demand  Greece  to preserve is now no easy part  But asks high Wisdom deep Design and Art  For  Jove  averse our humble Vows denies  And bows his Head to  Hector  's Sacrifice  What Eye has witness'd or what Ear believ'd  In one great Day by one great Arm atchiev'd  Such wond'rous Deeds as  Hector  's Hand has done  And we beheld the last revolving Sun  What Honours the belov'd of  Jove  adorn  Sprung from no God and of no Goddess born  Yet such his Acts as  Greeks  unborn shall tell  And curse the Battel where their Fathers fell  Now speed thy hasty Course along the Fleet  There call great  Ajax  and the Prince of  Creet  Our self to hoary  Nestor  will repair  To keep the Guards on Duty be his Care  For  Nestor  's Influence best that Quarter guides  Whose Son with  Merion  o'er the Watch presides  To whom the  Spartan  These thy Orders born  Say shall I stay or with Dispatch return  There shalt thou stay the King of Men reply'd  Else may we miss to meet without a Guide  The Paths so many and the Camp so wide  Still with your Voice the sloathful Soldiers raise  Urge by their Father's Fame their future Praise  Forget we now our State and lofty Birth  Not Titles here but Works must prove our Worth  To labour is the Lot of Man below  And when  Jove  gave us Life he gave us Woe  This said each parted to his sev'ral Cares  The King to  Nestor  's sable Ship repairs  The sage Protector of the  Greeks  he found  Stretch'd in his Bed with all his Arms around  The variouscolour'd Scarf the Shield he rears  The shining Helmet and the pointed Spears  The dreadful Weapons of the Warrior's Rage  That old in Arms disdain'd the Peace of Age  Then leaning on his Hand his watchful Head  The hoary Monarch rais'd his Eyes and said  What art thou speak that on Designs unknown  While others sleep thus range the Camp alone  Seek'st thou some Friend or nightly Centinel  Stand off approach not but thy Purpose tell  O Son of  Neleus  thus the King rejoin'd  Pride of the  Greeks  and Glory of thy Kind  Lo here the wretched  Agamemnon  stands  Th' unhappy Gen'ral of the  Grecian  Bands  Whom  Jove  decrees with daily Cares to bend  And Woes that only with his Life shall end  Scarce can my Knees these trembling Limbs sustain  And scarce my Heart support its Load of Pain  No Taste of Sleep these heavy Eyes have known  Confus'd and sad I wander thus alone  With Fears distracted with no fix'd Design  And all my People's Miseries are mine  If ought of use thy waking Thoughts suggest  Since Cares like mine deprive thy Soul of Rest  Impart thy Counsel and assist thy Friend  Now let us jointly to the Trench descend  At ev'ry Gate the fainting Guard excite  Tir'd with the Toils of Day and Watch of Night  Else may the sudden Foe our Works invade  So near and favour'd by the gloomy Shade  To him thus  Nestor  Trust the Pow'rs above  Nor think proud  Hector  's Hopes confirm'd by  Jove  How ill agrees the Views of vain Mankind  And the wise Counsels of th' eternal Mind  Audacious  Hector  if the Gods ordain  That great  Achilles  rise and rage again  What Toils attend thee and what Woes remain  Lo faithful  Nestor  thy Command obeys  The Care is next our other Chiefs to raise  Ulysses Diomed  we chiefly need  Mages  for Strength  Oïleus  fam'd for Speed  Some other be dispatch'd of nimbler Feet  To those tall Ships remotest of the Fleet  Where lie great  Ajax  and the King of  Crete  To rouse the  Spartan  I my self decree  Dear as he is to us and dear to thee  Yet must I tax his Sloath that claims no share  With his great Brother in this martial Care  Him it behov'd to ev'ry Chief to sue  Preventing ev'ry Part perform'd by you  For strong  Necessity  our Toils demands  Claims all our Hearts and urges all our Hands  To whom the King With Rev'rence we allow  Thy just Rebukes yet learn to spare them now  My gen'rous Brother is of gentle kind  He seems remiss but bears a valiant Mind  Thro' too much Def'rence to our Sov'reign Sway  Content to follow when we lead the way  But now our Ills industrious to prevent  Long e'er the rest he rose and sought my Tent  The Chiefs you nam'd already at his Call  Prepare to meet us near the Navywall  Assembling there between the Trench and Gates  Near the NightGuards our chosen Council waits  Then none said  Nestor  shall his Rule withstand  For great Examples justify Command  With that the venerable Warrior rose  The shining Greaves his manly Legs inclose  His purple Mantle golden Buckles join'd  Warm with the softest Wool and doubly lin'd  Then rushing from his Tent he snatch'd in hast  His steely Lance that lighten'd as he past  The Camp he travers'd thro' the sleeping Crowd  Stopp'd at  Ulysses'  Tent and call'd aloud  Ulysses  sudden as the Voice was sent  Awakes starts up and issues from his Tent  What new Distress what sudden Cause of Fright  Thus leads you wandring in the silent Night  O prudent Chief the  Pylian  Sage reply'd  Wise as thou art be now thy Wisdom try'd  Whatever means of Safety can be sought  Whatever Counsels can inspire our Thought  Whatever Methods or to fly or fight  All all depend on this important Night  He heard return'd and took his painted Shield  Then join'd the Chiefs and follow'd thro' the Field  Without his Tent bold  Diomed  they found  All sheath'd in Arms his brave Companions round  Each sunk in Sleep extended on the Field  His Head reclining on his bossy Shield  A Wood of Spears stood by that fixt upright  Shot from their flashing Points a quiv'ring Light  A Bull's black Hide compos'd the Hero's Bed  A splendid Carpet roll'd beneath his Head  Then with his Foot old  Nestor  gently shakes  The slumb'ring Chief and in these Words awakes  Rise Son of  Tydeus  to the brave and strong  Rest seems inglorious and the Night too long  But sleep'st thou now when from yon' Hills the Foe  Hangs o'er the Fleet and shades our Walls below  At this soft Slumber from his Eyelids fled  The Warrior saw the hoary Chief and said  Wond'rous old Man whose Soul no Respite knows  Tho' Years and Honours bid thee seek Repose  Let younger  Greeks  our sleeping Warriors wake  Ill fits thy Age these Toils to undertake  My Friend he answer'd gen'rous is thy Care  These Toils my Subjects and my Sons might bear  Their loyal Thoughts and pious Loves conspire  To ease a Sov'reign and relieve a Sire  But now the last Despair surrounds our Host  No Hour must pass no Moment must be lost  Each single  Greek  in this conclusive Strife  Stands on the sharpest Edge of Death or Life  Yet if my Years thy kind Regard engage  Employ thy Youth as I employ my Age  Succeed to these my Cares and rouze the rest  He serves me most who serves his Country best  This said the Hero o'er his Shoulders slung  A Lion's Spoils that to his Ankles hung  Then seiz'd his pond'rous Lance and strode along  Meges  the bold with  Ajax  fam'd for speed  The Warrior rouz'd and to th' Entrenchments led  And now the Chiefs approach the nightly Guard  A wakeful Squadron each in Arms prepar'd  Th' unweary'd Watch their list'ning Leaders keep  And couching close repell invading Sleep  So faithful Dogs their fleecy Charge maintain  With Toil protected from the prowling Train  When the gaunt Lioness with Hunger bold  Springs from the Mountains tow'rd the guarded Fold  Thro'breaking Woods her rust'ling Course they hear  Loud and more loud the Clamours strike their Ear  Of Hounds and Men they start they gaze around  Watch ev'ry Side and turn to ev'ry Sound  Thus watch'd the  Grecians  cautious of Surprize  Each Voice each Motion drew their Ears and Eyes  Each Step of passing Feet increas'd th'Affright  And hostile  Troy  was ever full in Sight  Nestor  with Joy the wakeful Band survey'd  And thus accosted thro' the gloomy Shade  'Tis well my Sons your nightly Cares employ  Else must our Host become the Scorn of  Troy  Watch thus and  Greece  shall liveThe Hero said  Then o'er the Trench the following Chieftains led  His Son and godlike  Merion  march'd behind  For these the Princes to their Council join'd  The Trenches past th' assembl'd Kings around  In silent State the Consistory crown'd  A Place there was yet undefil'd with Gore  The Spot where  Hector  stop'd his Rage before  When Night descending from his vengeful Hand  Repriev'd the Relicks of the  Grecian  Band  The Plain beside with mangled Corps was spread  And all his Progress mark'd by Heaps of dead  There sate the mournful Kings when  Neleus'  Son  The Council opening in these Words begun  Is there he said a Chief so greatly brave  His Life to hazard and his Country save  Lives there a Man who singly dares to go  To yonder Camp or seize some stragling Foe  Or favour'd by the Night approach so near  Their Speech their Counsels and Designs to hear  If to besiege our Navies they prepare  Or  Troy  once more must be the Seat of War  This could he learn and to our Peers recite  And pass unharm'd the Dangers of the Night  What Fame were his thro' all succeeding Days  While  Phoebus  shines or Men have tongues to praise  What Gifts his grateful Country would bestow  What must not  Greece  to her Deliv'rer owe  A sable Ewe each Leader should provide  With each a sable Lambkin by her side  At ev'ry Rite his Share should be increas'd  And his the foremost Honours of the Feast  Fear held them mute Alone untaught to fear  Tydides  spokeThe Man you seek is here  Thro' yon' black Camps to bend my dang'rous way  Some God within commands and I obey  But let some other chosen Warrior join  To raise my Hopes and second my Design  By mutual Confidence and mutual Aid  Great Deeds are done and great Discov'ries made  The Wise new Prudence from the Wise acquire  And one brave Hero fans another's Fire  Contending Leaders at the Word arose  Each gen'rous Breast with Emulation glows  So brave a Task each  Ajax  strove to share  Bold  Merion  strove and  Nestor  's valiant Heir  The  Spartan  wish'd the second Place to gain  And great  Ulysses  wish'd nor wish'd in vain  Then thus the King of Men the Contest ends  Thou first of Warriors and thou best of Friends  Undaunted  Diomed  what Chief to join  In this great Enterprize is only thine  Just be thy Choice without Affection made  To Birth or Office no respect be paid  Let Worth determine here The Monarch spake  And inly trembled for his Brother's sake  Then thus the Godlike  Diomed  rejoin'd  My Choice declares the Impulse of my Mind  How can I doubt while great  Ulysses  stands  To lend his Counsels and assist our Hands  A Chief whose Safety is  Minerva  's Care  So fam'd so dreadful in the Works of War  Blest in his Conduct I no Aid require  Wisdom like his might pass thro' Flames of Fire  It fits thee not before these Chiefs of Fame  Reply'd the Sage to praise me or to blame  Praise from a Friend or Censure from a Foe  Are lost on Hearers that our Merits know  But let us hasteNight rolls the Hours away  The red'ning Orient shows the coming Day  The Stars shine fainter on th'Aetherial Plains  And of Night's Empire but a third remains  Thus having spoke with gen'rous Ardour prest  In Arms Terrific their huge Limbs they drest  A twoedg'd Faulchion  Thrasymed  the brave  And ample Buckler to  Tydides  gave  Then in a leathern Helm he cas'd his Head  Short of its Crest and with no Plume o'erspread  Such as by Youths unus'd to Arms are worn  No Spoils enrich it and no Studs adorn  Next him  Ulysses  took a shining Sword  A Bow and Quiver with bright Arrows stor'd  A wellprov'd Casque with Leather Braces bound  Thy Gift  Meriones  his Temples crown'd  Soft Wool within without in order spread  A Boar's white Teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his Head  This from  Amyntor  rich  Ormenus'  Son  Autolychus  by fraudful Rapine won  And gave  Amphydamas  from him the Prize  Molus  receiv'd the Pledge of social Ties  The Helmet next by  Merion  was possess'd  And now  Ulysses'  thoughtful Temples press'd  Thus sheath'd in Arms the Council they forsake  And dark thro' Paths oblique their Progress take  Just then in sign she favour'd their Intent  A longwing'd Heron great  Minerva  sent  This tho' surrounding Shades obscur'd their View  By the shrill Clang and whistling Wings they knew  As from the Right she soar'd  Ulysses  pray'd  Hail'd the glad Omen and address'd the Maid  O Daughter of that God whose Arm can wield  Th' avenging Bolt and shake the dreadful Shield  O thou for ever present in my way  Who all my Motions all my Toils survey  Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy Shade  Safe by thy Succour to our Ships convey'd  And let some Deed this signal Night adorn  To claim the Tears of  Trojans  yet unborn  Then Godlike  Diomed  prefer'd his Pray'r  Daughter of  Jove  unconquer'd  Pallas  hear  Great Queen of Arms whose Favour  Tydeus  won  As thou defend'st the Sire defend the Son  When on  Aesopus'  Banks the banded Pow'rs  Of  Greece  he left and sought the  Theban  Tow'rs  Peace was his Charge receiv'd with peaceful Show  He went a Legat but return'd a Foe  Then help'd by thee and cover'd by thy Shield  He fought with numbers and made numbers yield  So now be present Oh celestial Maid  So still continue to the Race thine Aid  A youthful Steer shall fall beneath the Stroke  Untam'd unconscious of the galling Yoke  With ample Forehead and with spreading Horns  Whose taper tops refulgent Gold adorns  The Heroes pray'd and  Pallas  from the Skies  Accords their Vow succeeds their Enterprize  Now like two Lions panting for the Prey  With deathful Thoughts they trace the dreary way  Thro' the black Horrors of th' ensanguin'd Plain  Thro' Dust thro' Blood o'er Arms and Hills of Slain  Nor less bold  Hector  and the Sons of  Troy  On high Designs the wakeful Hours employ  Th' assembled Peers their lofty Chief inclos'd  Who thus the Counsels of his Breast propos'd  What glorious Man for high Attempts prepar'd  Dares greatly venture for a rich Reward  Of yonder Fleet a bold Discov'ry make  What Watch they keep and what Resolves they take  If now subdu'd they meditate their Flight  And spent with Toil neglect the Watch of Night  His be the Chariot that shall please him most  Of all the Plunder of the vanquish'd Host  His the fair Steeds that all the rest excell  And his the Glory to have serv'd so well  A Youth there was among the Tribes of  Troy  Dolon  his Name  Eumedes'  only Boy  Five Girls beside the rev'rend Herald told  Rich was the Son in Brass and rich in Gold  Not blest by Nature with the Charms of Face  But swift of Foot and matchless in the Race  Hector  he said my Courage bids me meet  This high Atchievement and explore the Fleet  But first exalt thy Sceptre to the Skies  And swear to grant me the demanded Prize  Th' immortal Courses and the glitt'ring Car  That bear  Pelides  thro' the Ranks of War  Encourag'd thus no idle Scout I go  Fulfill thy Wish their whole Intention know  Ev'n to the Royal Tent pursue my way  And all their Counsels all their Aims betray  The Chief then heav'd the golden Sceptre high  Attesting thus the Monarch of the Sky  Be witness thou immortal Lord of all  Whose Thunder shakes the dark aerial Hall  By none but  Dolon  shall this Prize be born  And him alone th' immortal Steeds adorn  Thus  Hector  swore the Gods were call'd in vain  But the rash Youth prepares to scour the Plain  Across his Back the bended Bow he flung  A Wolf's grey Hide around his Shoulders hung  A Ferret's downy Fur his Helmet lin'd  And in his Hand a pointed Javelin shin'd  Then never to return he sought the Shore  And trod the Path his Feet must tread no more  Scarce had he pass'd the Steeds and  Trojan  Throng  Still bending forward as he cours'd along  When on the hollow way th' approaching Tread  Ulysses  mark'd and thus to  Diomed  O Friend I hear some Step of hostile Feet  Moving this way or hast'ning to the Fleet  Some Spy perhaps to lurk beside the Main  Or nightly Pillager that strips the slain  Yet let him pass and win a little Space  Then rush behind him and prevent his Pace  But if too swift of Foot he flies before  Confine his Course along the Fleet and Shore  Betwixt the Camp and him our Spears employ  And intercept his hop'd return to  Troy  With that they step'd aside and stoop'd their head  As  Dolon  pass'd behind a Heap of dead  Along the Path the Spy unwary flew  Soft at just distance both the Chiefs pursue  So distant they and such the Space between  As when two Teams of Mules divide the Green  To whom the Hind like Shares of Land allows  When now few Furrows part th' approaching Ploughs  Now  Dolon  list'ning heard them as they past  Hector  he thought had sent and check'd his hast  Till scarce at distance of a Javelin's throw  No Voice succeeding he perceiv'd the Foe  As when two skilful Hounds the Lev'ret winde  Or chase thro' Woods obscure the trembling Hinde  Now lost now seen they intercept his way  And from the Herd still turn the flying Prey  So fast and with such Fears the  Trojan  flew  So close so constant the bold  Greeks  pursue  Now almost on the Fleet the Dastard falls  And mingles with the Guards that watch the Walls  When brave  Tydides  stopp'd a gen'rous Thought  Inspir'd by  Pallas  in his Bosom wrought  Lest on the Foe some forward  Greek  advance  And snatch the Glory from his lifted Lance  Then thus aloud Whoe'er thou art remain  This Javelin else shall fix thee to the Plain  He said and high in Air the Weapon cast  Which wilful err'd and o'er his Shoulder past  Then fix'd in Earth Against the trembling Wood  The Wretch stood prop'd and quiver'd as he stood  A sudden Palsy seiz'd his turning Head  His loose Teeth chatter'd and his Colour fled  The panting Warriors seize him as He stands  And with unmanly Tears his Life demands  O spare my Youth and for the Breath I owe  Large Gifts of Price my Father shall bestow  Vast Heaps of Brass shall in your Ships be told  And Steel well temper'd and refulgent Gold  To whom  Ulysses  made this wise Reply  Whoe'er thou art be bold nor fear to die  What moves thee say when Sleep has clos'd the Sight  To roam the silent Fields in dead of Night  Cam'st thou the Secrets of our Camp to find  By  Hector  prompted or thy daring Mind  Or art some Wretch by hopes of Plunder led  Thro' Heaps of Carnage to despoil the dead  Then thus pale  Dolon  with a fearful Look  Still as he spoke his Limbs with Horror shook  Hither I came by  Hector  's Words deceiv'd  Much did he promise rashly I believ'd  No less a Bribe than great  Achilles'  Car  And those swift Steeds that sweep the Ranks of War  Urg'd me unwilling this Attempt to make  To learn what Counsels what Resolves you take  If now subdu'd you fix your Hopes on Flight  And tir'd with Toils neglect the Watch of Night  Bold was thy Aim and glorious was the Prize    Ulysses  with a scornful Smile replies  Far other Rulers those proud Steeds demand  And scorn the Guidance of a vulgar Hand  Ev'n great  Achilles  scarce their Rage can tame  Achilles  sprung from an immortal Dame  But say be faithful and the Truth recite  Where lies encamp'd the  Trojan  Chief to Night  Where stand his Coursers In what Quarter sleep  Their other Princes tell what Watch they keep  Say since this Conquest what their Counsels are  Or here to combat from their City far  Or back to  Ilion  's Walls transfer the War  Ulysses  thus and thus  Eumedes'  Son  What  Dolon  knows his faithful Tongue shall own  Hector  the Peers assembling in his Tent  A Council holds at  Ilus'  Monument  No certain Guards the nightly Watch partake  Where e'er yon' Fires ascend the  Trojans  wake  Anxious for  Troy  the Guard the Natives keep  Safe in their Cares th' auxiliar Forces sleep  Whose Wives and Infants from the Danger far  Discharge their Souls of half the Fears of War  Then sleep those Aids among the  Trojan  Train  Enquir'd the Chief or scatter'd o'er the Plain  To whom the Spy Their Pow'rs they thus dispose  The  Paeons  dreadful with their bended Bows  The  Carians Caucons  the  Pelasgian  Host  And  Leleges  encamp along the Coast  Not distant far lie higher on the Land  The  Lycian Mysian  and  Maeonian  Band  And  Phrygia  's Horse by  Thymbras'  ancient Wall  The  Thracians  utmost and apart from all  These  Troy  but lately to her Succour won  Led on by  Rhesus  great  Eioneus'  Son  I saw his Coursers in proud Triumph go  Swift as the Wind and white as WinterSnow  Rich silver Plates his shining Car infold  His solid Arms refulgent flame with Gold  No mortal Shoulders suit the glorious Load  Celestial  Panoply  to grace a God  Let me unhappy to your Fleet be born  Or leave me here a Captive's Fate to mourn  In cruel Chains till your Return reveal  The Truth or Falshood of the News I tell  To this  Tydides  with a gloomy Frown  Think not to live tho' all the Truth be shown  Shall we dismiss thee in some future Strife  To risk more bravely thy now forfeit Life  Or that again our Camps thou may'st explore  Noonce a Traytor thou betray'st no more  Sternly he spoke and as the Wretch prepar'd  With humble Blandishment to stroke his Beard  Like Light'ning swift the wrathful Faulchion flew  Divides the Neck and cuts the Nerves in two  One Instant snatch'd his trembling Soul to Hell  The Head yet speaking mutter'd as it fell  The furry Helmet from his Brow they tear  The Wolf's grey Hide th'unbended Bow and Spear  These great  Ulysses  lifting to the Skies  To fav'ring  Pallas  dedicates the Prize  Great Queen of Arms receive this hostile Spoil  And let the  Thracian  Steeds reward our Toil  Thee first of all the heav'nly Host we praise  Oh speed our Labours and direct our ways  This said the Spoils with dropping Gore defac'd  High on a spreading Tamarisk he plac'd  Then heap'd with Reeds and gather'd Boughs the Plain  To guide their Footsteps to the Place again  Thro' the still Night they cross the devious Fields  Slipp'ry with Blood o'er Arms and Heaps of Shields  Arriving where the  Thracian  Squadrons lay  And eas'd in Sleep the Labours of the Day  Rang'd in three Lines they view the prostrate Band  The Horses yok'd beside each Warrior stand  Their Arms in order on the Ground reclin'd  Thro' the brown Shade the fulgid Weapons shin'd  Amidst lay  Rhesus  stretch'd in Sleep profound  And the white Steeds behind his Chariot bound  The welcome Sight  Ulysses  first descries  And points to  Diomed  the tempting Prize  The Man the Coursers and the Car behold  Describ'd by  Dolon  with the Arms of Gold  Now brave  Tydides  now thy Courage try  Approach the Chariot and the Steeds untye  Or if thy Soul aspire to fiercer Deeds  Urge thou the Slaughter while I seize the Steeds  Pallas  this said her Hero's Bosom warms  Breath'd in his Heart and strung his nervous Arms  Where e'er he pass'd a purple Stream pursu'd  His thirsty Faulchion fat with hostile Blood  Bath'd all his Footsteps dy'd the Fields with Gore  And a low Groan remurmur'd thro' the Shore  So the grim Lion from his nightly Den  O'erleaps the Fences and invades the Pen  On Sheep or Goats resistless in his way  He falls and foaming rends the guardless Prey  Nor stopp'd the Fury of his vengeful Hand  Till twelve lay breathless of the  Thracian  Band  Ulysses  following as his Part'ner slew  Back by the Foot each slaughter'd Warrior drew  The milkwhite Coursers studious to convey  Safe to the Ships he wisely clear'd the way  Lest the fierce Steeds not yet to Battels bred  Should start and tremble at the Heaps of dead  Now twelve dispatch'd the Monarch last they found  Tydides'  Faulchion fix'd him to the Ground  Just then a deathful Dream  Minerva  sent  A warlike Form appear'd before his Tent  Whose visionary Steel his Bosom tore  So dream'd the Monarch and awak'd no more  Ulysses  now the snowy Steeds detains  And leads them fasten'd by the silver Reins  These with his Bow unbent he lash'd along  The Scourge forgot on  Rhesus  Chariot hung  Then gave his Friend the Signal to retire  But him new Dangers new Atchievements fire  Doubtful he stood or with his reeking Blade  To send more Heroes to th' infernal Shade  Drag off the Car where  Rhesus  Armour lay  Or heave with manly Force and lift away  While unresolv'd the Son of  Tydeus  stands  Pallas  appears and thus her Chief commands  Enough my Son from farther Slaughter cease  Regard thy Safety and depart in Peace  Haste to the Ships the gotten Spoils enjoy  Nor tempt too far the hostile Gods of  Troy  The Voice divine confess'd the martial Maid  In haste he mounted and her Word obey'd  The Coursers fly before  Ulysses'  Bow  Swift as the Wind and white as WinterSnow  Not unobserv'd they pass'd the God of Light  Had watch'd his  Troy  and mark'd  Minerva  's Flight  Saw  Tydeus'  Son with heav'nly Succour blest  And vengeful Anger fill'd his sacred Breast  Swift to the  Trojan  Camp descends the Pow'r  And wakes  Hippocoon  in the MorningHour  On  Rhesus'  side accustom'd to attend  A faithful Kinsman and instructive Friend  He rose and saw the Field deform'd with Blood  An empty Space where late the Coursers stood  The yetwarm  Thracians  panting on the Coast  For each he wept but for his  Rhesus  most  Now while on  Rhesus'  Name he calls in vain  The gath'ring Tumult spreads o'er all the Plain  On Heaps the  Trojans  rush with wild affright  And wond'ring view the Slaughters of the Night  Mean while the Chiefs arriving at the Shade  Where late the Spoils of  Hector  's Spy were laid  Ulysses  stopp'd to him  Tydides  bore  The Trophee dropping yet with  Dolon  's Gore  Then mounts again again their nimble Feet  The Coursers ply and thunder tow'rds the Fleet  Old  Nestor  first perceiv'd th' approaching Sound  Bespeaking thus the  Grecian  Peers around  Methinks the Noise of tramp'ling Steeds I hear  Thick'ning this way and gath'ring on my Ear  Perhaps some Horses of the  Trojan  Breed  So may ye Gods my pious Hopes succeed  The great  Tydides  and  Ulysses  bear  Return'd triumphant with this Prize of War  Yet much I fear ah may that Fear be vain  The Chiefs outnumber'd by the  Trojan  Train  Perhaps ev'n now pursu'd they seek the Shore  Or oh perhaps those Heroes are no more  Scarce had he spoke when lo the Chiefs appear  And spring to Earth the  Greeks  dismiss their Fear  With Words of Friendship and extended Hands  They greet the Kings and  Nestor  first demands  Say thou whose Praises all our Host proclaim  Thou living Glory of the  Grecian  Name  Say whence these Coursers by what Chance bestow'd  The Spoil of Foes or Present of a God  Not those fair Steeds so radiant and so gay  That draw the burning Chariot of the Day  Old as I am to Age I scorn to yield  And daily mingle in the martial Field  But sure till now no Coursers struck my Sight  Like these conspicuous thro' the Ranks of Fight  Some God I deem conferr'd the glorious Prize  Blest as ye are and fav'rites of the Skies  The Care of him who bids the Thunder roar  And  Minerva  her whose Fury bathes the World with Gore  Father not so sage  Ithacus  rejoin'd  The Gifts of Heav'n are of a nobler kind  Of  Thracian  Lineage are the Steeds ye view  Whose hostile King the brave  Tydides  slew  Sleeping he dy'd with all his Guards around  And twelve beside lay gasping on the Ground  These other Spoils from conquer'd  Dolon  came  A Wretch whose Swiftness was his only Fame  By  Hector  sent our Forces to explore  He now lies headless on the sandy Shore  Then o'er the Trench the bounding Coursers flew  The joyful  Greeks  with loud Acclaim pursue  Strait to  Tydides'  high Pavilion born  The matchless Steeds his ample Stalls adorn  The neighing Coursers their new Fellows greet  And the full Racks are heap'd with gen'rous Wheat  But  Dolon  's Armour to his Ships convey'd  High on the painted Stern  Ulysses  laid  A Trophy destin'd to the blueey'd Maid  Now from nocturnal Sweat and sanguine Stain  They cleanse their Bodies in the neighb'ring Main  Then in the polish'd Bath refresh'd from Toil  Their Joints they supple with dissolving Oil  In due Repast indulge the genial Hour  And first to  Pallas  the Libations pour  They sit rejoicing in her Aid divine  And the crown'd Goblet foams with Floods of Wine  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Tenth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TENTH BOOK  I  IT is observable says  Eustathius  that the Poet very artfully repairs the Loss of the last Day by this nocturnal Stratagem and it is plain that such a Contrivance was necessary The Army was dispirited and  Achilles  inflexible but by the Success of this Adventure the Scale is turn'd in favour of the  Grecians  II  VERSE  All but the King  c  Homer  here with a very small Alteration repeats the Verses which begin the second Book He introduces  Agamemnon  with the same Pomp as he did  Jupiter  he ascribes to him the same Watchfulness over Men as he exercis'd over the Gods and  Jove  and  Agamemnon  are the only Persons awake while Heaven and Earth are asleep  Eustathius  III  VERSE  Or sends soft Snows    Scaliger  's Criticism against this passage that it never lightens and snows at the same time is sufficiently refuted by Experience See  Bossu  of the Epic Poem  lib    c  and  Barnes  's Note on this Place  IV  VERSE  Or bids the brazen Throat of War to roar    There is something very noble and sublime in this Image The  vast Jaws of War  is an Expression that very poetically represents the Voraciousness of War and gives us a lively Idea of an insatiate Monster  Eustathius  V  VERSE  By fits one Flash succeeds  c  It requires some Skill in  Homer  to take the chief Point of his Similitudes he has often been misunderstood in that respect and his Comparisons have frequently been strain'd to comply with the Fancies of Commentators This Comparison which is brought to illustrate the Frequency of  Agamemnon  's Sighs has been usually thought to represent in general the Groans of the King whereas what  Homer  had in his view was only the quick Succession of them  VI  VERSE  Now o'er the Fields  c  Aristotle  answers a Criticism of some Censurers of  Homer  on this Place They asked how it was that  Agamemnon  shut up in his Tent in the Night could see the  Trojan  Camp at one view and the Fleet at another as the Poet represents it It is says  Aristotle  only a metaphorical manner of Speech  To cast one's Eye  means but  to reflect upon  or  to revolve in one's Mind  and that employ'd  Agamemnon  's Thoughts in his Tent which had been the chief Object of his Eyes the Day before  VII  VERSE  He rends his Hairs in sacrifice to  Jove  I know this Action of  Agamemnon  has been taken only as a common Expression of Grief and so indeed it was render'd by  Accius  as cited by  Tully Tusc quaest l    Scindens dolore identidem intonsam comam  But whoever reads the Context will I believe be of Opinion that  Jupiter  is mention'd here on no other Account than as he was apply'd to in the offering of these Hairs in an humble Supplication to the offended Deity who had so lately manifested his Anger  VIII  VERSE  He rose and first he cast his Mantle round    I fancy it will be entertaining to the Reader to observe how well the Poet at all times suits the Descriptions to the Circumstances of the Persons We must remember that this Book continues the Actions of one Night the whole Army is now asleep and the Poet takes this Opportunity to give us a Description of several of his Heroes suitable to their proper Characters  Agamemnon  who is every where describ'd as anxious for the Good of his People is kept awake by a fatherly Care for their Preservation  Menelaus  for whose sake the  Greeks  had suffer'd so greatly shares all their Misfortunes and is restless while they are in danger  Nestor  a provident wise old Man sacrifices his Rest even in the Extremity of Age to his Love for his Country  Ulysses  a Person next to  Nestor  in Wisdom is ready at the first Summons he finds it hard while the  Greeks  suffer to compose himself to Sleep but is easily awak'd to march to its Defence But  Diomed  who is every where describ'd as a daring Warrior sleeps unconcern'd at the Nearness of the Enemy and is not awaked without some Violence He is said to be asleep but he sleeps like a Soldier in compleat Arms  I could not pass over one Circumstance in this Place in Relation to  Nestor  It is a Pleasure to see what Care the Poet takes of his favourite Councellor He describes him lying  in a soft Bed wraps him up in a warm Cloak to preserve his Age from the Coldness of the Night but  Diomed  a gallant young Hero sleeps upon the Ground in open Air and indeed every Warrior is dress'd in Arms peculiar to that Season The Hide of a Lion or Leopard is what they all put on being not to engage an Enemy but to meet their Friends in Council  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Sends he some Spy  c  Menelaus  in this Place starts a Design which is afterwards proposed by  Nestor  in Council the Poet knew that the Project would come with greater Weight from the Age of the one than from the Youth of the other and that the Valiant would be ready to execute a Design which so venerable a Counsellor had form'd  Eustathius  X  VERSE  Such wondrous Deeds as  Hector  's Hand  c  We hear  Agamemnon  in this Place launching into the Praises of a gallant Enemy but if any one think that he raises the Actions of  Hector  too high and sets him above  Achilles  himself this Objection will vanish if he considers that he commends him as the bravest of mere Men but still he is not equal to  Achilles  who was descended from a Goddess  Agamemnon  undoubtedly had  Achilles  in his Thoughts when he says  Sprung from no God  c  But his Anger will not let him even name the Man whom he thus obliquely praises  Eustathius  proceeds to observe that the Poet ascribes the gallant Exploits of  Hector  to his Piety and had he not been favour'd by  Jove  he had not been thus victorious  He also remarks that there is a double Tautology in this Speech of  Agamemnon  as  and  This proceeds from the Wonder which the King endeavours to express at the Greatness of  Hector  's Actions He labours to make his Words answer the great Idea he had conceiv'd of them and while his Mind dwells upon the same Object he falls into the same manner of expressing it This is very natural to a Person in his Circumstances whose Thoughts are as it were pent up and struggle for an Utterance  XI  VERSE  The Paths so many  c  'Tis plain from this Verse as well as from many others that the Art of Fortification was in some degree of Perfection in  Homer  's Days Here are Lines drawn that traverse the Camp ev'ry way the Ships are drawn up in the manner of a Rampart and sally Ports made at proper Distances that they might without Difficulty either retire or issue out as the Occasion should require  Eustathius  XII  VERSE  Seek'st thou some Friend or nightly Centinel    It has been thought that  Nestor  asks this Question upon the Account of his Son  Thrasymedes  who commanded the Guard that Night He seems to be under some Apprehension lest he should have remitted the Watch And it may also be gather'd from this Passage that in those Times the Use of the Watchword was unknown because  Nestor  is oblig'd to crowd several Questions together before he can learn whether  Agamemnon  be a Friend or an Enemy The Shortness of the Questions agrees admirably with the Occasion upon which they were made it being necessary that  Nestor  should be immediately inform'd who he was who pass'd along the Camp If a Spy that he might stand upon his Guard if a Friend that he might not cause an Alarm to be given to the Army by multiplying Questions  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  Lo here the wretched  Agamemnon  stands    Eustathius  observes that  Agamemnon  here paints his Distress in a very pathetical manner while the meanest Soldier is at rest the General wanders about disconsolate and is superior now in nothing so much as in Sorrow but this Sorrow proceeds not from a base abject Spirit but from a generous Disposition he is not anxious for the Loss of his own Glory but for the Sufferings of his People It is a noble Sorrow and springs from a commendable Tenderness and Humanity  XIV  VERSE  My gen'rous Brother is of gentle Kind    Agamemnon  is every where represented as the greatest Example of brotherly Affection and he at all times defends  Menelaus  but never with more Address than now  Nestor  had accus'd  Menelaus  of Sloath the King is his Advocate but pleads his Excuse only in part He does not entirely acquit him because he would not contradict so wise a Man as  Nestor  nor does he condemn him because his Brother at this time was not guilty but he very artfully turns the Imputation of  Nestor  to the Praise of  Menelaus  and affirms that what might seem to be Remissness in his Character was only a Deference to his Authority and that his seeming Inactivity was but an Unwillingness to act without Command  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  A Wood of Spears stood by  c  The Picture here given us of  Diomed  sleeping in his Arms with his Soldiers about him and the Spears sticking upright in the Earth has a near Resemblance to that in the first Book of  Samuel  Ch ℣ Saul  lay sleeping within the Trench and his Spear stuck in the Ground at his Bolster but  Abner  and the People lay round about him  XVI  VERSE  From yon' Hill the Foe  c  It is necessary if we would form an exact Idea of the Battels of  Homer  to carry in our Minds the Place where each Action was fought It will therefore be proper to enquire where that Eminence stood upon which the  Trojans  encamp'd this Night  Eustathius  is inclinable to believe it was  Callicolone  the Situation of which you will find in the Map of  Homer  's Battels but it will appear from what  Dolon  says ℣ of  Hector  's being encamp'd at the Monument of  Ilus  that this Eminence must be the  Tumulus  on which that Monument was situate and so the old Scholiast rightly explains it  XVII  VERSE  But now the last Despair surrounds our Host    The different Behaviour of  Nestor  upon the same Occasion to different Persons is worthy Observation  Agamemnon  was under a Concern and Dejection of Spirit from the Danger of his Army To raise his Courage  Nestor  gave him hopes of Success and represented the State of Affairs in the most favourable view But he applies himself to  Diomed  who is at all times enterprizing and incapable of Despair in a far different manner He turns the darkest side to him and gives the worst Prospect of their Condition This Conduct says  Eustathius  shews a great deal of Prudence 'tis the Province of Wisdom to encourage the dishearten'd with hopes and to qualify the forward Courage of the daring with Fears that the Valour of the one may not sink thro' Despair nor that of the other fly out into Rashness  XVIII  VERSE  And now the Chiefs approach the nightly Guard    It is usual in Poetry to pass over little Circumstances and carry on the greater  Menelaus  in this Book was sent to  call some of the Leaders the Poet has too much Judgment to dwell upon the trivial Particulars of his performing his Message but lets us know by the Sequel that he had performed it It would have clogg'd the poetical Narration to have told us how  Menelaus  waked the Heroes to whom he was dispatched and had been but a Repetition of what the Poet had fully describ'd before He therefore says the same Author drops these Particularities and leaves them to be supply'd by the Imagination of the Reader 'Tis so in Painting the Painter does not always draw at the full length but leaves what is wanting to be added by the Fancy of the Beholder  XIX  VERSE  So faithful Dogs  c  This Simile is in all its Parts just to the Description it is meant to illustrate The Dogs represent the Watch the Flock the  Greeks  the Fold their Camp and the wild Beast that invades them  Hector  The Place Posture and Circumstance are painted with the utmost Life and Nature  Eustathius  takes notice of one Particular in this Description which shews the manner in which their Centinels kept the Guard The Poet tells us that they  sate down with their Arms in their Hands  I think that this was not so prudent a Method as is now used it being almost impossible for a Man that stands to drop asleep whereas one that is seated may easily be overpower'd by the Fatigue of a long Watch  Eustathius  XX  VERSE  Then o'er the Trench the following Princes led    The Reason why  Nestor  did not open the Council within the Trenches was with a design to encourage the Guards and those whom he intended to send to enter the  Trojan  Camp It would have appear'd unreasonable to send others over the Entrenchments upon a hazardous Enterprize and not to have dared himself to set a Foot beyond them This also could  not fail of inflaming the Courage of the  Grecian  Spies who would know themselves not to be far from Assistance while so many of the Princes were passed over the Ditch as well as they  Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  Is there he said a Chief so greatly brave    Nestor  proposes his Design of sending Spies into the  Trojan  Army with a great deal of Address He begins with a general Sentence and will not choose any one Hero for fear of disgusting the rest Had  Nestor  named the Person he would have paid him a Complement that was sure to be attended with the Hazard of his Life and that Person might have believ'd that  Nestor  exposed him to a Danger which his Honour would not let him decline while the rest might have resented such a Partiality which would have seem'd to give the Preference to another before them It therefore was Wisdom in  Nestor  to propose the Design in general Terms whereby all the gallant Men that offer'd themselves satisfy'd their Honour by being willing to share the Danger with  Diomed  and it was no Disgrace to be left behind after they had offer'd to hazard their Lives for their Country  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE  Or seize some straggling Foe    It is worthy Observation with how much Caution  Nestor  opens this Design and with how much Courage  Diomed  accepts it  Nestor  forms it with Coolness but  Diomed  embraces it with Warmth and Resolution  Nestor  only proposes that some Man would approach the Enemy and intercept some straggling  Trojan  but  Diomed  offers to penetrate the very Camp  Nestor  was afraid lest no one should undertake it  Diomed  overlooks the Danger and presents himself as willing to march against the whole Army of  Troy Eustathius  XXIII  VERSE  To Birth or Office no respect be paid    Eustathius  remarks that  Agamemnon  artfully steals away his Brother from Danger the Foundness he bears to him makes him think him unequal to so bold an Enterprize and prefer his Safety to his Glory He farther adds that the Poet intended to condemn that faulty Modesty which makes one sometimes prefer a Nobleman before a Person of more real Worth To be greatly born is an Happiness but no Merit whereas personal Virtues shew a Man worthy of that Greatness to which he is not born  It appears from hence how honourable it was of old to go upon these Parties by Night or undertake those Offices which are now only the Task of common Soldiers  Gideon  in the Book of  Judges  as  Dacier  observes goes as a Spy into the Camp of  Midian  tho' he was at that time General of the  Israelites  XXIV  VERSE  Blest in his Conduct    There requir'd some Address in  Diomed  to make his Choice without offending the  Grecian  Princes each of them might think it an Indignity to be refus'd such a Place of Honour  Diomed  therefore chuses  Ulysses  not because he is braver than the rest but because he is wiser This part of his Character was allow'd by all the Leaders of the Army and none of them thought it a Disparagement to themselves as they were Men of Valour to see the first Place given to  Ulysses  in Point of Wisdom No doubt but the Poet by causing  Diomed  to make this Choice intended to insinuate that Valour ought always to be temper'd with Wisdom to the end that what is design'd with Prudence may be executed with Resolution  Eustathius  XXV  VERSE  It fits thee not to praise me or to blame    The Modesty of  Ulysses  in this Passage is very remarkable tho' undoubtedly he deserved to be praised yet he interrupts  Diomed  rather than he would be a Hearer of his own Commendation What  Diomed  spoke in Praise of  Ulysses  was utter'd to justify his Choice of him to the Leaders of the Army otherwise the Praise he had given him would have been no better than Flattery  Eustathius  XXVI  VERSE  Night rolls the Hours away  The Stars shine fainter on th' Aetherial Plains  And of Night's Empire but a third remains    It has been objected that  Ulysses  is guilty of a threefold Tautology when every word he utter'd shews the Necessity of being concise If the Night was nigh spent there was the less time to lose in Tautologies But this is so far from being a fault that it is a Beauty  Ulysses  dwells upon the Shortness of the time before the Day appears in order to urge  Diomed  to the greater Speed in prosecuting the Design  Eustathius  XXVII  VERSE  But a third remains    One ought to take notice with how much Exactness  Homer  proportions his Incidents to the time of Action These two Books take up no more than the Compass of one Night and this Design could not have been executed in any other Part of it The Poet had before told us that all the Plain was enlightned by the Fires of  Troy  and consequently no Spy could pass over to their Camp till they were almost sunk and extinguish'd which could not be till near the Morning  'Tis observable that the Poet divides the Night into three Parts from whence we may gather that the  Grecians  had  three Watches during the Night The first and second of which were over when  Diomed  and  Ulysses  set out to enter the Enemy's Camp  Eustathius  XXVIII  VERSE  A twoedg'd Faulchion  Thrasymed  the brave  c  It is a very impertinent Remark of  Scaliger  that  Diomed  should not have gone from his Tent without a Sword The Expedition he now goes upon could not be foreseen by him at the time he rose He was awak'd of a sudden and sent in haste to call some of the Princes Besides he went but to Council and even then carry'd his Spear with him as  Homer  had already inform'd us I think if one were to study the Art of cavilling there would be more occasion to blame  Virgil  for what  Scaliger  praises him giving a Sword to  Euryalus  when he had one before  Aen  ℣  XXIX  VERSE  Then in a Leathern Helm    It may not be improper to observe how conformably to the Design the Poet arms these two Heroes  Ulysses  has a Bow and Arrows that he might be able to wound the Enemy at a distance and so retard his Flight till he could overtake him and for fear of a Discovery  Diomed  is arm'd with an Helmet of Leather that the glittering of it might not betray him  Eustathius  There is some Resemblance in this whole Story to that of  Nisus  and  Euryalus  in  Virgil  and as the Heroes are here successful and in  Virgil  unfortunate it was perhaps as great an Instance of  Virgil  's Judgment to describe the unhappy Youth in a glittering Helmet which occasion'd his Discovery as it was in  Homer  to arm his successful one in the contrary manner  XXX  VERSE  A wellprov'd Casque    Mr  Barnes  has a pretty Remark on this Place that it was probably from this  Description  that the ancient Painters and Tragic Poets constantly represented  Ulysses  with the  Pileus  on his Head but this Particularity could not be preserved with any Grace in the Translation  XXXI  VERSE  This from  Amyntor c  The Succession of this Helmet descending from one Hero to another is imitated by  Virgil  in the Story of  Nisus  and  Euryalus  Euryalus phaleras Rhamnetis aurea bullis  Cingula Tiburti Remulo ditissimus olim  Quae mittit dona hospitio cum jungeret absens  Caedicus ille suo moriens dat habere nepoti  Post mortem bello Rutuli pugnamque potiti  It was anciently a Custom to make these military Presents to brave Adventurers So  Jonathan  in the first Book of  Samuel stript himself of the Robe that was upon him and gave it to  David  and his Garments even to his Sword and his Bow and his Girdle  Ch ℣  XXXII  VERSE Ulysses  hail'd the glad Omen    This Passage sufficiently justifies  Diomed  for his Choice of  Ulysses Diomed  who was most renown'd for Valour might have given a wrong Interpretation to this Omen and so have been discourag'd from proceeding in the Attempt For tho' it really signify'd that as the Bird was not seen but only heard by the Sound of its Wings so they should not be discover'd by the  Trojans  but perform Actions which all  Troy  should hear with Sorrow yet on the other hand it might imply that as they discovered the Bird by the Noise of its Wings so they should be betray'd by the Noise they should make in the  Trojan  Army The Reason why  Pallas  does not send the Bird that is sacred to her self but the Heron is because it is a Bird of  Prey and denoted that they should spoil the  Trojans Eustathius  XXXIII  VERSE  Thro' Dust thro' Blood  c  Zenophon  has imitated this Passage but what the Poet gives us in one Line the Historian portracts into several Sentences    c  "When the Battel was over one might behold the Ground dy'd red with Blood and cover'd with the Dead Spears broken and drawn Swords some on the Ground some in the Bodies of the slain  Eustathius  XXXIV  VERSE  Nor less bold  Hector c  It is the Remark of  Eustathius  that  Homer  sends out the  Trojan  Spy in this Place in a very different manner from the  Grecian  ones before Having been very particular in describing the Counsel of the  Greeks  he avoids tiring the Reader here with parallel Circumstances and passes it in general Terms In the first a wise old Man proposes the Adventure with an Air of Deference in the second a brave young Man with an Air of Authority The one promises a small Gift but very honourable and certain the other a great one but uncertain and less honourable because 'tis given as a Reward So that  Diomed  and  Ulysses  are inspired with the Love of Glory  Dolon  is possest with a Thirst of Gain They proceed with a sage and circumspect Valour he with Rashness and Vanity they go in Conjunction he alone they cross the Fields out of the Road he follows the common Track In all this there is a Contraste that is admirable and a Moral that strikes every Reader at first Sight  XXXV  VERSE Dolon  his Name    'Tis scarce to be conceiv'd with what Conciseness the Poet has here given us the Name the Fortunes the Pedigree the Office the Shape the Swiftness  of  Dolon  He seems to have been eminent for nothing so much as for his Wealth tho' undoubtedly he was by Place one of the first Rank in  Troy Hector  summons him to this Assembly amongst the Chiefs of  Troy  nor was he unknown to the  Greeks  for  Diomed  immediately after he had seiz'd him calls him by his Name Perhaps being an Herald he had frequently pass'd between the Armies in the Execution of his Office  The Ancients observ'd upon this Place that it was the Office of  Dolon  which made him offer himself to  Hector  The Sacred Character gave him hopes that they would not violate his Person should he happen to be taken and his Riches he knew were sufficient to purchase his Liberty besides all which Advantages he had hopes from his Swiftness to escape any Pursuers  Eustathius  XXXVI  VERSE  Not blest by Nature with the Charms of Face    The Original is  Which some ancient Criticks thought to include a Contradiction because the Man who is illshap'd can hardly be swift in running taking the word  as apply'd in general to the Air of the whole Person But  Aristotle  acquaints us that word was as proper in regard to the Face only and that it was usual with the  Cretans  to call a Man with a handsome Face  So that  Dolon  might want a good Face and yet be wellshap'd enough to make an excellent Racer  Poet c    XXXVII  VERSE  Swear to grant me  c  It is evident from this whole Narration that  Dolon  as a Man of no Worth or Courage his Covetousness seems to be the sole Motive of his undertaking this Exploit and whereas  Diomed  neither desir'd any Reward nor when promis'd requir'd any Assurance of  it  Dolon  demands an Oath and will not trust the Promise of  Hector  he every where discovers a base Spirit and by the Sequel it will appear that this vain Boaster instead of discovering the Army of the Enemy becomes a Traytor to his own  Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  Th' immortal Coursers and the glitt'ring Car    Hector  in the foregoing Speech promises the best Horses in the  Grecian  Army as a Reward to any one who would undertake what he propos'd  Dolon  immediately demands those of  Achilles  and confines the general Promise of  Hector  to the particular Horses of that brave Hero  There is something very extraordinary in  Hector  's taking a solemn Oath that he will give the Chariots and Steeds of  Achilles  to  Dolon  The Ancients says  Eustathius  knew not whose Vanity most to wonder at that of  Dolon  or  Hector  the one for demanding this or the other for promising it Tho' we may take notice that  Virgil  lik'd this Extravagance so well as to imitate it where  Ascanius  without being asked promises the Horses and Armour of  Turnus  to  Nisus  on his undertaking a like Enterprize  Vidisti quo Turnus equo quibus ibat in armis  Aureus ipsum illum clypeum cristasque rubentes  Excipiam sorti jam nunc tua praemia Nise  Unless one should think the Rashness of such a Promise better agreed with the Ardour of this youthful Prince than with the Character of an experienc'd Warrior like  Hector  XXXIX  VERSE  Such the Space between As when two Teams of Mules  c  I wonder  Eustathius  takes no notice of the manner of Ploughing used by the Ancients which is describ'd in these Verses and of which we have the best Account from  Dacier  She is not satisfied with the Explanation given by  Didymus  that  Homer  meant the Space which Mules by their Swiftness gain upon Oxen that plow in the same Field  "The  Grecians  says she did not plow in the manner now in use They first broke up the Ground with Oxen and then plow'd it more lightly with Mules When they employed two Plows in a Field they measured the Space they could Plow in a Day and set their Plows at the two ends of that Space and those Plows proceeded toward each other This intermediate Space was constantly fix'd but less in Proportion for two Plows of Oxen than for two of Mules because Oxen are slower and toil more in a Field that has not been yet turn'd up whereas Mules are naturally swifter and make greater speed in a Ground that has already had the first Plowing I therefore believe that what  Homer  calls  is the Space left by the Husbandmen between two Plows of Mules which till the same Field And as this Space was so much the greater in a Field already plow'd by Oxen he adds what he says of Mules that they are swifter and fitter to give the second Plowing than Oxen and therefore distinguishes the Field so plowed by the Epithet of  deep  For that Space was certain of so many Acres or Perches and always larger than in a Field as yet untill'd which being heavier and more difficult requir'd the Interval to be so much the less between two Plows of Oxen because they could not dispatch so much Work  Homer  could not have serv'd himself of a juster Comparison for a thing that pass'd in the Fields at the same time he shews his Experience in the Art of Agriculture and gives his Verses a most agreeable Ornament as indeed all the Images drawn from this Art are peculiarly entertaining  This manner of measuring a Space of Ground by a Comparison from Plowing seems to have been customary in those times from that Passage in the first Book of  Samuel  Ch ℣  And the first Slaughter which  Jonathan  and his Armourbearer made was about twenty Men within as it were half a Furrow of an Acre of Land which a Yoke of Oxen might plow  XL  VERSE  Quiver'd as he stood  c  The Poet here gives us a very lively Picture of a Person in the utmost Agonies of Fear  Dolon  's Swiftness forsakes him and he stands shackled by his Cowardice The very Words express the thing he describes by the broken Turn of the  Greek  Verses And something like it is aimed at in the  English      XLI  VERSE  Be bold nor fear to die    'Tis observable what Caution the Poet here uses in reference to  Dolon Ulysses  does not make him any Promises of Life but only bids him very artfully not to think of dying So that when  Diomed  kills him he was not guilty of a Breach of Promise and the Spy was deceiv'd rather by the Art and Subtlety of  Ulysses  than by his Falshood  Dolon  's Understanding seems entirely to be disturb'd by his Fears he was so cautious as not to believe a Friend just before without an Oath but here he trusts an Enemy without so much as a Promise  Eustathius  XLII  VERSE  Urg'd me unwilling    'Tis observable that the Cowardice of  Dolon  here betrays him into a Falshood Tho'  Eustathius  is of Opinion that the word in the Original means no more than  contrary to my Judgment  XLIII  VERSE  Where lies encamp'd    The Night was now very far advanc'd the Morning approach'd and the two Heroes had their whole Design still to execute  Ulysses  therefore  complies with the Necessity of the Time and makes his Questions very short tho' at the same time very full In the like manner when  Ulysses  comes to shew  Diomed  the Chariot of  Rhesus  he uses a sudden Transition without the usual Form of speaking  XLIV  VERSE  No certain Guards    Homer  to give an Air of Probability to this Narration lets us understand that the  Trojan  Camp might easily be enter'd without a Discovery because there were no Centinels to guard it This might happen partly thro' the Security which their late Success had thrown them into and partly thro' the Fatigues of the former Day Besides which  Homer  gives us another very natural Reason the Negligence of the auxiliar Forces who being Foreigners had nothing to lose by the Fall of  Troy  XLV  VERSE  Where e'er yon Fires ascend    This is not to be understood of those Fires which  Hector  commanded to be kindled at the beginning of this Night but only of the houshold Fires of the  Trojans  distinct from the Auxiliars The Expression in the Original is somewhat remarkable but implies those People that were Natives of  Troy  and  signifying the same thing So that  and  mean to have Houses or Hearths in  Troy Eustathius  XLVI  VERSE  Divides the Neck    It may seem a Piece of Barbarity in  Diomed  to kill  Dolon  thus in the very Act of supplicating for Mercy  Eustathius  answers that it was very necessary that it should be so for fear if he had defer'd his Death he might have cry'd out to the  Trojans  who hearing his Voice would have been upon their guard  XLVII  VERSE  Just then a deathful Dream  Minerva  sent    All the Circumstances of this Action the Night  Rhesus  buried in a profound Sleep and  Diomed  with the Sword in his Hand hanging over the Head of that Prince furnish'd  Homer  with the Idea of this Fiction which represents  Rhesus  dying fast asleep and as it were beholding his Enemy in a Dream plunging a Sword into his Bosom This Image is very natural for a Man in this Condition awakes no farther than to see confusedly what environs him and to think it not a Reality but a Vision  Eustathius Dacier  XLVIII  VERSE  And wakes  Hippocoon  Apollo  's waking the  Trojans  is only an Allegory to imply that the Light of the Morning awaken'd them  Eustathius  XLIX  VERSE  Old  Nestor  first perceiv'd  c  It may with an Appearance of Reason be ask'd whence it could be that  Nestor  whose Sense of hearing might be suppos'd to be impair'd by his great Age should be the first Person among so many youthful Warriors who hears the Tread of the Horse's Feet at a distance  Eustathius  answers that  Nestor  had a particular Concern for the Safety of  Diomed  and  Ulysses  on this Occasion as he was the Person who by proposing the Undertaking had exposed them to a very signal Danger and consequently his extraordinary Care for their Preservation did more than supply the Disadvantage of his Age This agrees very well with what immediately follows for the old Man breaks out into a Transport at the Sight of them and in a wild sort of Joy asks some Questions which could not have proceeded from him but while he was under that happy Surprize  Eustathius  L  VERSE  Of  Thracian  Lineage  c  It is observable says  Eustathius  that  Homer  in this Place unravels the Series of this Night's Exploits and inverts the Order of the former Narration This is partly occasion'd by a Necessity of  Nestor  's Enquiries and partly to relate the same thing in a diffeway that he might not tire the Reader with an exact Repetition of what he knew before  LI  VERSE  And twelve beside  c  How comes it to pass that the Poet should here call  Dolon  the thirteenth that was slain whereas he had already number'd up thirteen besides him  Eustathius  answers that he mentions  Rhesus  by himself by way of Eminence Then coming to recount the  Thracians  he reckons twelve of 'em so that taking  Rhesus  separately  Dolon  will make the thirteenth  LII  VERSE  They cleanse their Bodies in the Main  c  We have here a Regimen very agreeable to the Simplicity and Austerity of the old heroic Times These Warriors plunge into the Sea to wash themselves for the salt Water is not only more purifying than any other but more corroborates the Nerves They afterwards enter into a Bath and rub their Bodies with Oil which by softening and moistening the Flesh prevents too great a Dissipation and restores the natural Strength  Eustathius  LIII  VERSE  In due Repast  c  It appears from hence with what Preciseness  Homer  distinguishes the Time of these Actions 'Tis evident from this Passage that immediately  after their Return it was Daylight that being the Time of taking such a Repast as is here describ'd  LIV  I cannot conclude the Notes to this Book without observing that what seems the principal Beauty of it and what distinguishes it among all the others is the Liveliness of its Paintings The Reader sees the most natural NightScene in the World he is led step by step with the Adventurers and made the Companion of all their Expectations and Uncertainties We see the very Colour of the Sky know the Time to a Minute are impatient while the Heroes are arming our Imagination steals out after them becomes privy to all their Doubts and even to the secret Wishes of their Hearts sent up to  Minerva  We are alarmed at the Approach of  Dolon  hear his very Footsteps assist the two Chiefs in pursuing him and stop just with the Spear that arrests him We are perfectly acquainted with the Situation of all the Forces with the Figure in which they lie with the Disposition of  Rhesus  and the  Thracians  with the Posture of his Chariot and Horses The marshy Spot of Ground where  Dolon  is killed the Tamarisk or aquatic Plants upon which they hang his Spoils and the Reeds that are heap'd together to mark the Place are Circumstances the most Picturesque imaginable And tho' it must be owned that the human Figures in this Piece are excellent and disposed in the properest Actions I cannot but confess my Opinion that the chief Beauty of it is in the Prospect a finer than which was never drawn by any Pencil  THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The third Battel and the Acts of  Agamemnon  AGamemnon  having arm'd himself leads the  Grecians  to Battel  Hector  prepares the  Trojans  to receive them while  Jupiter Juno  and  Minerva  give the Signals of War  Agamemnon  bears all before him and  Hector  is commanded by  Jupiter  who sends  Iris  for that purpose to decline the Engagement till the King shall be wounded and retire from the Field He then makes a great Slaughter of the Enemy  Ulysses  and  Diomed  put a stop to him for a while but the latter being wounded by  Paris  is obliged to desert his Companion who is encompass'd by the  Trojans  wounded and in the utmost danger till  Menelaus  and  Ajax  rescue him  Hector  comes against  Ajax  but that Hero alone opposes Multitudes and rallies the  Greeks  In the mean time  Machaon  in the other Wing of the Army is pierced with an Arrow by  Paris  and carry'd from the Fight in Nestor's Chariot  Achilles  who overlook'd the Action from his Ship sends  Patroclus  to enquire which of the  Greeks  was wounded in that manner  Nestor  entertains him in his Tent with an Account of the Accidents of the Day and a long Recital of some former Wars which he remember'd tending to put  Patroclus  upon persuading  Achilles  to fight for his Countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in Achilles's Armour  Patroclus  in his Return meets  Eurypilus  also wounded and assists him in that Distress  This Book opens with the eight and twentieth Day of the Poem and the same Day with its various Actions and Adventures is extended thro' the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth Books The  Scene  lies in the Field near the Monument of  Ilus  THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THE Saffron Morn with early Blushes spread  Now rose refulgent from  Tithonus'  Bed  With newborn Day to gladden mortal Sight  And gild the Courts of Heav'n with sacred Light  When baleful  Eris  sent by  Jove  's Command  The Torch of Discord blazing in her Hand  Thro' the red Skies her bloody Sign extends  And wrapt in Tempests o'er the Fleets descends  High on  Ulysses'  Bark her horrid Stand  She took and thunder'd thro' the Seas and Land  Ev'n  Ajax  and  Achilles  heard the Sound  Whose Ships remote the guarded Navy bound  Thence the black Fury thro' the  Grecian  Throng  With Horror sounds the loud  Orthian  Song  The Navy shakes and at the dire Alarms  Each Bosom boils each Warrior starts to Arms  No more they sigh inglorious to return  But breathe Revenge and for the Combat burn  The King of Men his hardy Host inspires  With loud Command with great Example fires  Himself first rose himself before the rest  His mighty Limbs in radiant Armour drest  And first he cas'd his manly Legs around  In shining Greaves with silver Buckles bound  The beaming Cuirass next adorn'd his Breast  The same which once King  Cinyras  possest  The Fame of  Greece  and her assembled Host  Had reach'd that Monarch on the  Cyprian  Coast  'Twas then the Friendship of the Chief to gain  This glorious Gift he sent nor sent in vain  Ten Rows of azure Steel the Work infold  Twice ten of Tin and twelve of ductile Gold  Three glitt'ring Dragons to the Gorget rise  Whose imitated Scales against the Skies  Reflected various Light and arching bow'd  Like colour'd Rainbows o'er a show'ry Cloud    Jove  's wond'rous Bow of three celestial Dyes  Plac'd as a Sign to Man amid the Skies  A radiant Baldrick o'er his Shoulder ty'd  Sustain'd the Sword that glitter'd at his side  Gold was the Hilt a silver Sheath encas'd  The shining Blade and golden Hangers grac'd  His Buckler's mighty Orb was next display'd  That round the Warrior cast a dreadful Shade  Ten Zones of Brass its ample Brims surround  And twice ten Bosses the bright Convex crown'd  Tremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its Field  And circling Terrors fill'd th' expressive Shield  Within its Concave hung a silver Thong  On which a mimic Serpent creeps along  His azure Length in easy Waves extends  Till in three Heads th' embroider'd Monster ends  Last o'er his Brows his fourfold Helm he plac'd  With nodding Horsehair formidably grac'd  And in his Hands two steely Javelins wields  That blaze to Heav'n and lighten all the Fields  That instant  Juno  and the martial Maid  In happy Thunders promis'd  Greece  their Aid  High o'er the Chief they clash'd their Arms in Air  And leaning from the Clouds expect the War  Close to the Limits of the Trench and Mound  The fiery Coursers to their Chariots bound  The Squires restrain'd The Foot with those who wield  The lighter Arms rush'd forward to the Field  To second these in close Array combin'd  The Squadrons spread their sable Wings behind  Now Shouts and Tumults wake the tardy Sun  As with the Light the Warriors Toils begun  Ev'n  Jove  whose Thunder spoke his Wrath distill'd  Red Drops of Blood o'er all the fatal Field  The Woes of Men unwilling to survey  And all the Slaughters that must stain the Day  Near  Ilus'  Tomb in Order rang'd around  The  Trojan  Lines possess'd the rising Ground  There wise  Polydamas  and  Hector  stood  Aeneas  honour'd as a guardian God  Bold  Polybus Agenor  the divine  The BrotherWarriors of  Antenor  's Line  With youthful  Acamas  whose beauteous Face  And fair Proportion match'd th' etherial Race  Great  Hector  cover'd with his spacious Shield  Plies all the Troops and orders all the Field  As the red Star now shows his sanguine Fires  Thro' the dark Clouds and now in Night retires  Thus thro' the Ranks appear'd the Godlike Man  Plung'd in the Rear or blazing in the Van  While streamy Sparkles restless as he flies  Flash from his Arms as Light'ning from the Skies  As sweating Reapers in some wealthy Field  Rang'd in two Bands their crooked Weapons wield  Bear down the Furrows till their Labours meet  Thick fall the heapy Harvests at their Feet  So  Greece  and  Troy  the Field of War divide  And falling Ranks are strow'd on ev'ry side  None stoop'd a Thought to base inglorious Flight  But Horse to Horse and Man to Man they fight  Not rabid Wolves more fierce contest their Prey  Each wounds each bleeds but none resign the Day  Discord with Joy the Scene of Death descries  And drinks large Slaughter at her sanguin Eyes  Discord alone of all th' immortal Train  Swells the red Horrors of this direful Plain  The Gods in peace their golden Mansions fill  Rang'd in bright Order on th'  Olympian  Hill  But gen'ral Murmurs told their Griefs above  And each accus'd the partial Will of  Jove  Meanwhile apart superior and alone  Th' eternal Monarch on his awful Throne  Wrapt in the Blaze of boundless Glory sate  And fix'd fulfill'd the just Decrees of Fate  On Earth he turn'd his allconsid'ring Eyes  And mark'd the Spot where  Ilion  's Tow'rs arise  The Sea with Ships the Fields with Armies spread  The Victor's Rage the dying and the dead  Thus while the MorningBeams increasing bright  O'er Heav'ns pure Azure spread the growing Light  Commutual Death the Fate of War confounds  Each adverse Battel goar'd with equal Wounds  But now what time in some sequester'd Vale  The weary Woodman spreads his sparing Meal  When his tir'd Arms refuse the Axe to rear  And claim a Respite from the Sylvan War  But not till half the prostrate Forests lay  Stretch'd in long Ruin and expos'd to Day  Then nor till then the  Greeks  impulsive Might  Pierc'd the black  Phalanx  and let in the Light  Great  Agamemnon  then the Slaughter led  And slew  Bienor  at his People's Head  Whose Squire  Oïleus  with a sudden spring  Leap'd from the Chariot to revenge his King  But in his Front he felt the fatal Wound  Which pierc'd his Brain and stretch'd him on the Ground  Atrides  spoil'd and left them on the Plain  Vain was their Youth their glitt'ring Armour vain  Now soil'd with Dust and naked to the Sky  Their snowy Limbs and beauteous Bodies lie  Two Sons of  Priam  next to Battel move  The Product one of Marriage one of Love  In the same Car the BrotherWarriors ride  This took the charge to combat that to guide  Far other Task than when they wont to keep  On  Ida  's Tops their Father's fleecy Sheep  These on the Mountains once  Achilles  found  And captive led with pliant Osiers bound  Then to their Sire for ample Sums restor'd  But now to perish by  Atrides'  Sword  Pierc'd in the Breast the baseborn  Isus  bleeds  Cleft thro' the Head his Brother's Fate succeeds  Swift to the Spoil the hasty Victor falls  And stript their Features to his Mind recalls  The  Trojans  see the Youths untimely die  But helpless tremble for themselves and fly  So when a Lion ranging o'er the Lawns  Finds on some grassy Lare the couching Fawns  Their Bones he cracks their reeking Vitals draws  And grinds the quiv'ring Flesh with bloody Jaws  The frighted Hind beholds and dares not stay  But swift thro' rustling Thickets bursts her way  All drown'd in Sweat the panting Mother flies  And the big Tears roll trickling from her Eyes  Amidst the Tumult of the routed Train  The Sons of false  Antimachus  were slain  He who for Bribes his faithless Counsels sold  And voted  Helen  's Stay for  Paris'  Gold  Atrides  mark'd as these their Safety sought  And slew the Children for the Father's Fault  Their headstrong Horse unable to restrain  They shook with Fear and drop'd the silken Rein  Then in their Chariot on their Knees they fall  And thus with lifted Hands for Mercy call  Oh spare our Youth and for the Life we owe  Antimachus  shall copious Gifts bestow  Soon as he hears that not in Battel slain  The  Grecian  Ships his captive Sons detain  Large Heaps of Brass in Ransome shall be told  And Steel welltemper'd and persuasive Gold  These Words attended with a Flood of Tears  The Youths address'd to unrelenting Ears  The vengeful Monarch gave this stern Reply  If from  Antimachus  ye spring ye die  The daring Wretch who once in Council stood  To shed  Ulysses'  and my Brother's Blood  For proffer'd Peace And sues his Seed for Grace  No die and pay the Forfeit of your Race  This said  Pisander  from the Car he cast  And pierc'd his Breast supine he breath'd his last  His Brother leap'd to Earth but as he lay  The trenchant Faulchion lopp'd his Hands away  His sever'd Head was toss'd among the Throng  And rolling drew a bloody Trail along  Then where the thickest fought the Victor flew  The King's Example all his  Greeks  pursue  Now by the Foot the flying Foot were slain  Horse trod by Horse lay foaming on the Plain  From the dry Fields thick Clouds of Dust arise  Shade the black Host and intercept the Skies  The brasshoof'd Steeds tumultuous plunge and bound  And the thick Thunder beats the lab'ring Ground  Still slaught'ring on the King of Men proceeds  The distanc'd Army wonders at his Deeds  As when the Winds with raging Flames conspire  And o'er the Forests roll the Flood of Fire  In blazing heaps the Grove's old Honours fall  And one refulgent Ruin levells all  Before  Atrides'  Rage so sinks the Foe  Whole Squadrons vanish and proud Heads lie low  The Steeds fly trembling from his waving Sword  And many a Car now lighted of its Lord  Wide o'er the Field with guideless Fury rolls  Breaking their Ranks and crushing out their Souls  While his keen Faulchion drinks the Warriors Lives  More grateful now to Vulturs than their Wives  Perhaps great  Hector  then had found his Fate  But  Jove  and Destiny prolong'd his Date  Safe from the Darts the Care of Heav'n he stood  Amidst Alarms and Deaths and Dust and Blood  Now past the Tomb where ancient  Ilus  lay  Thro' the mid Field the routed urge their way  Where the wild Figs th' adjoining Summit crown  That Path they take and speed to reach the Town  As swift  Atrides  with loud Shouts pursu'd  Hot with his Toil and bath'd in hostile Blood  Now near the Beechtree and the  Scaean  Gates  The Hero haults and his Associates waits  Meanwhile on ev'ry side around the Plain  Dispers'd disorder'd fly the  Trojan  Train  So flies a Herd of Beeves that hear dismay'd  The Lion's roaring thro' the midnight Shade  On Heaps they tumble with successless haste  The Savage seizes draws and rends the last  Not with less Fury stern  Atrides  flew  Still press'd the Rout and still the hindmost slew  Hurl'd from their Cars the bravest Chiefs are kill'd  And Rage and Death and Carnage load the Field  Now storms the Victor at the  Trojan  Wall  Surveys the Tow'rs and meditates their Fall  But  Jove  descending shook th'  Idaean  Hills  And down their Summits pour'd a hundred Rills  Th' unkindled Light'ning in his Hand he took  And thus the manycolour'd Maid bespoke  Iris  with haste thy golden Wings display  To Godlike  Hector  this our Word convey  While  Agamemnon  wastes the Ranks around  Fights in the Front and bathes with Blood the Ground  Bid him give way but issue forth Commands  And trust the War to less important Hands  But when or wounded by the Spear or Dart  That Chief shall mount his Chariot and depart  Then  Jove  shull string his Arm and fire his Breast  Then to her Ships shall flying  Greece  be press'd  Till to the Main the burning Sun descend  And sacred Night her awful Shade extend  He spoke and  Iris  at his Word obey'd  On Wings of Winds descends the various Maid  The Chief she found amidst the Ranks of War  Close to the Bulwarks on his glitt'ring Car  The Goddess then O Son of  Priam  hear  From  Jove  I come and his high Mandate bear  While  Agamemnon  wastes the Ranks around  Fights in the Front and bathes with Blood the Ground  Abstain from Fight yet issue forth Commands  And trust the War to less important Hands  But when or wounded by the Spear or Dart  The Chief shall mount his Chariot and depart  Then  Jove  shall string thy Arm and fire thy Breast  Then to her Ships shall flying  Greece  be prest  Till to the Main the burning Sun descend  And sacred Night her awful Shade extend  She said and vanish'd  Hector  with a Bound  Vaults from his Chariot on the trembling Ground  In clanging Arms He grasps in either Hand  A pointed Lance and speeds from Band to Band  Revives their Ardour turns their Steps from flight  And wakes anew the dying Flames of Fight  They stand to Arms the  Greeks  their Onset dare  Condense their Pow'rs and wait the coming War  New Force new Spirit to each Breast returns  The Fight renew'd with fiercer Fury burns  The King leads on all fix on him their Eye  And learn from him to conquer or to die  Ye sacred Nine Celestial Muses tell  Who fac'd him first and by his Prowess fell  The great  Iphidamas  the bold and young  From sage  Antenor  and  Theano  sprung  Whom from his Youth his Grandsire  Cisseus  bred  And nurs'd in  Thrace  where snowy Flocks are fed  Scarce did the Down his rosy Cheeks invest  And early Honour warm his gen'rous Breast  When the kind Sire consign'd his Daughter's Charms    Theano  's Sister to his youthful Arms  But call'd by Glory to the Wars of  Troy  He leaves untasted the first Fruits of Joy  From his lov'd Bride departs with melting Eyes  And swift to aid his dearer Country flies  With twelve black Ships he reach'd  Percope  's Strand  Thence took the long laborious March by Land  Now fierce for Fame before the Ranks he springs  Tow'ring in Arms and braves the King of Kings  Atrides  first discharg'd the missive Spear  The  Trojan  stoop'd the Javelin pass'd in Air  Then near the Corselet at the Monarch's Heart  With all his Strength the Youth directs his Dart  But the broad Belt with Plates of Silver bound  The Point rebated and repell'd the Wound  Encumber'd with the Dart  Atrides  stands  Till grasp'd with Force he wrench'd it from his Hands  At once his weighty Sword discharg'd a Wound  Full on his Neck that fell'd him to the Ground  Stretch'd in the Dust th' unhappy Warrior lies  And Sleep eternal seals his swimming Eyes  Oh worthy better Fate oh early slain  Thy Country's Friend and virtuous tho' in vain  No more the Youth shall join his Consort's side  At once a Virgin and at once a Bride  No more with Presents her Embraces meet  Or lay the Spoils of Conquest at her Feet  On whom his Passion lavish of his Store  Bestow'd so much and vainly promis'd more  Unwept uncover'd on the Plain he lay  While the proud Victor bore his Arms away  Coon Antenor  's eldest Hope was nigh  Tears at the Sight came starting from his Eye  While pierc'd with Grief the muchlov'd Youth he view'd  And the pale Features now deform'd with Blood  Then with his Spear unseen his Time he took  Aim'd at the King and near his Elbow strook  The thrilling Steel transpierc'd the brawny Part  And thro' his Arm stood forth the barbed Dart  Surpriz'd the Monarch feels yet void of Fear  On  Coon  rushes with his lifted Spear  His Brother's Corps the pious  Trojan  draws  And calls his Country to assert his Cause  Defends him breathless on the smoaking Field  And o'er the Body spreads his ample Shield  Atrides  marking an unguarded Part  Transfix'd the Warrior with his brazen Dart  Prone on his Brother's bleeding Breast he lay  The Monarch's Faulchion lopp'd his Head away  The social Shades the same dark Journey go  And join each other in the Realms below  The vengeful Victor rages round the Fields  With ev'ry Weapon Art or Fury yields  By the long Lance the Sword or pond'rous Stone  Whole Ranks are broken and whole Troops o'erthrown  This while yet warm distill'd the purple Flood  But when the Wound grew stiff with clotted Blood  Then grinding Tortures his strong Bosom rend  Less keen those Darts the fierce  Ilythiae  send  The Pow'rs that cause the teeming Matron's Throes  Sad Mothers of unutterable Woes  Stung with the Smart all panting with the Pain  He mounts the Car and gives his Squire the Rein  Then with a Voice which Fury made more strong  And Pain augmented thus exhorts the Throng  O Friends O  Greeks  assert your Honours won  Proceed and finish what this Arm begun  Lo angry  Jove  forbids your Chief to stay  And envies half the Glories of the Day  He said the Driver whirls his lengthful Thong  The Horses fly the Chariot smoaks along  Clouds from their Nostrils the fierce Coursers blow  And from their Sides the Foam descends in Snow  Shot thro' the Battel in a Moment's Space  The wounded Monarch at his Tent they place  No sooner  Hector  saw the King retir'd  But thus his  Trojans  and his Aids he fir'd  Hear all ye  Dardan  all ye  Lycian  Race  Fam'd in close Fight and dreadful Face to Face  Now call to Mind your ancient Trophies won  Your great Forefathers Virtues and your own  Behold the Gen'ral flies deserts his Pow'rs  Lo  Jove  himself declares the Conquest ours  Now on yon' Ranks impell your foaming Steeds  And sure of Glory dare immortal Deeds  With Words like these the fiery Chief alarms  His fainting Host and ev'ry Bosom warms  As the bold Hunter chears his Hounds to tear  The brindled Lion or the tusky Bear  With Voice and Hand provokes their doubting Heart  And springs the foremost with his lifted Dart  So Godlike  Hector  prompts his Troops to dare  Nor prompts alone but leads himself the War  On the black Body of the Foes he pours  As from the Cloud's deep Bosom swell'd with Show'rs  A sudden Storm the purple Ocean sweeps  Drives the wild Waves and tosses all the Deeps  Say Muse when  Jove  the  Trojan  's Glory crown'd  Beneath his Arm what Heroes bit the Ground  Assaeus Dolops  and  Autonous  dy'd  Opites  next was added to their side  Then brave  Hipponous  fam'd in many a Fight  Opheltius Orus  sunk to endless Night  Aesymnus Agelaus  all Chiefs of Name  The rest were vulgar Deaths unknown to Fame  As when a western Whirlwind charg'd with Storms  Dispells the gather'd Clouds that  Notus  forms  The Gust continu'd violent and strong  Rolls sable Clouds in Heaps on Heaps along  Now to the Skies the foaming Billows rears  Now breaks the Surge and wide the bottom bares  Thus raging  Hector  with resistless Hands  O'erturns confounds and scatters all their Bands  Now the last Ruin the whole Host appalls  Now  Greece  had trembled in her wooden Walls  But wise  Ulysses  call'd  Tydides  forth  His Soul rekindled and awak'd his Worth  And stand we deedless O eternal Shame  Till  Hector  's Arm involve the Ships in Flame  Haste let us join and combat side by side  The Warrior thus and thus the Friend reply'd  No martial Toil I shun no Danger fear  Let  Hector  come I wait his Fury here  But  Jove  with Conquest crowns the  Trojan  Train  And  Jove  our Foe all human Force is vain  He sigh'd but sighing rais'd his vengeful Steel  And from his Car the proud  Thymbraeus  fell  Molion  the Charioteer pursu'd his Lord  His Death ennobled by  Ulysses'  Sword  There slain they left them in eternal Night  Then plung'd amidst the thickest Ranks of Fight  So two wild Boars outstrip the foll'owing Hounds  Then swift revert and Wounds return for Wounds  Stern  Hector  's Conquests in the middle Plain  Stood check'd a while and  Greece  respir'd again  The Sons of  Merops  shone amidst the War  Tow'ring they rode in one refulgent Car  In deep Prophetic Arts their Father skill'd  Had warn'd his Children from the  Trojan  Field  Fate urg'd them on the Father warn'd in vain  They rush'd to Fight and perish'd on the Plain  Their Breasts no more the vital Spirit warms  The stern  Tydides  strips their shining Arms  Hypirochus  by great  Ulysses  dies  And rich  Hippodamus  becomes his Prize  Great  Jove  from  Ide  with Slaughter fills his Sight  And level hangs the doubtful Scale of Fight  By  Tydeus'  Lance  Agastrophus  was slain  The farfam'd Hero of  Paeonian  Strain  Wing'd with his Fears on Foot he strove to fly  His Steeds too distant and the Foe too nigh  Thro' broken Orders swifter than the Wind  He fled but flying left his Life behind  This  Hector  sees as his experienc'd Eyes  Traverse the Files and to the Rescue flies  Shouts as he past the crystal Regions rend  And moving Armies on his March attend  Great  Diomed  himself was seiz'd with Fear  And thus bespoke his Brother of the War  Mark how this way yon' bending Squadrons yield  The Storm rolls on and  Hector  rules the Field  Here stand his utmost ForceThe Warrior said  Swift at the Word his pondrous Javelin fled  Nor miss'd its Aim but where the Plumage danc'd  Raz'd the smooth Cone and thence obliquely glanc'd  Safe in his Helm the Gift of  Phoebus'  Hands  Without a Wound the  Trojan  Hero stands  But yet so stunn'd that stagg'ring on the Plain  His Arm and Knee his sinking Bulk sustain  O'er his dim Sight the misty Vapours rise  And a short Darkness shades his swimming Eyes  Tydides  follow'd to regain his Lance  While  Hector  rose recover'd from the Trance  Remounts his Car and herds amidst the Crowd  The  Greek  pursues him and exults aloud  Once more thank  Phoebus  for thy forfeit Breath  Or thank that Swiftness which outstrips the Death  Well by  Apollo  are thy Pray'rs repaid  And oft' that partial Pow'r has lent his Aid  Thou shalt not long the Death deserv'd withstand  If any God assist  Tydides'  Hand  Fly then inglorious but thy Flight this Day  Whole Hecatombs of  Trojan  Ghosts shall pay  Him while he triumph'd  Paris  ey'd from far  The Spouse of  Helen  the fair Cause of War  Around the Field his feather'd Shafts he sent  From ancient  Ilus'  ruin'd Monument  Behind the Column plac'd he bent his Bow  And wing'd an Arrow at th' unwary Foe  Just as he stoop'd  Agastrophus  's Crest  To seize and drew the Corselet from his Breast  The Bowstring twang'd nor flew the Shaft in vain  But pierc'd his Foot and nail'd it to the Plain  The laughing  Trojan  with a joyful Spring  Leaps from his Ambush and insults the King  He bleeds he cries some God has sped my Dart  Would the same God had fixt it in his Heart  So  Troy  reliev'd from that widewasting Hand  Shall breathe from Slaughter and in combat stand  Whose Sons now tremble at his darted Spear  As scatter'd Lambs the rushing Lion fear  He dauntless thus Thou Conqu'ror of the Fair  Thou Womanwarrior with the curling Hair  Vain Archer trusting to the distant Dart  Unskill'd in Arms to act a manly Part  Thou hast but done what Boys or Women can  Such Hands may wound but not incense a Man  Nor boast the Scratch thy feeble Arrow gave  A Coward's Weapon never hurts the Brave  Not so this Dart which thou may'st one Day feel  Fate wings its Flight and Death is on the Steel  Where this but lights some noble Life expires  Its Touch makes Orphans bathes the cheeks of Sires  Steeps Earth in purple gluts the Birds of Air  And leaves such Objects as distract the Fair  Ulysses  hastens with a trembling Heart  Before him steps and bending draws the Dart  Forth flows the Blood an eager Pang succeeds  Tydides  mounts and to the Navy speeds  Now on the Field  Ulysses  stands alone  The  Greeks  all fled the  Trojans  pouring on  But stands collected in himself and whole  And questions thus his own unconquer'd Soul  What farther Subterfuge what Hopes remain  What Shame inglorious if I quit the Plain  What Danger singly if I stand the Ground  My Friends all scatter'd all the Foes around  Yet wherefore doubtful Let this Truth suffice  The Brave meets Danger and the Coward flies  To die or conquer proves a Hero's Heart  And knowing this I know a Soldier's Part  Such Thoughts revolving in his careful Breast  Near and more near the shady Cohorts prest  These in the Warrior their own Fate inclose  And round him deep the steely Circle grows  So fares a Boar whom all the Troop surrounds  Of shouting Huntsmen and of clam'rous Hounds  He grinds his Iv'ry Tusks he foams with Ire  His sanguine Eyeballs glare with living Fire  By these by those on ev'ry Part is ply'd  And the red Slaughter spreads on ev'ry side  Pierc'd thro' the Shoulder first  Deiopis  fell  Next  Ennomus  and  Thoon  sunk to Hell  Chersidamas  beneath the Navel thrust  Supinely falls and grasps the bloody Dust  Charops  the Son of  Hippasus  was near  Ulysses  reach'd him with the fatal Spear  But to his Aid his Brother  Socus  flies  Socus  the brave the gen'rous and the wise  Near as he drew the Warrior thus began  O great  Ulysses  muchenduring Man  Not deeper skill'd in ev'ry martial Slight  Than worn to Toils and active in the Fight  This Day two Brothers shall thy Conquest grace  And end at once the great  Hippasian  Race  Or thou beneath this Lance must press the Field  He said and forceful pierc'd his spacious Shield  Thro' the strong Brass the ringing Javelin thrown  Plow'd half his side and bar'd it to the Bone  By  Pallas'  Care the Spear tho' deep infix'd  Stop'd short of Life nor with his Entrails mix'd  The Wound not mortal wise  Ulysses  knew  Then furious thus but first some Steps withdrew  Unhappy Man whose Death our Hand shall grace  Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy Race  No longer check my Conquests on the Foe  But pierc'd by this to endless Darkness go  And add one Spectre to the Realms below  He spoke while  Socus  seiz'd with sudden Fright  Trembling gave way and turn'd his Back to Flight  Between his Shoulders pierc'd the following Dart  And held its Passage thro' the panting Heart  Wide in his Breast appear'd the grizly Wound  He falls his Armour rings against the Ground  Then thus  Ulysses  gazing on the Slain  Fam'd Son of  Hippasus  there press the Plain  There ends thy narrow Span assign'd by Fate  Heav'n owes  Ulysses  yet a longer Date  Ah Wretch no Father shall thy Corps compose  Thy dying Eyes no tender Mother close  But hungry Birds shall tear those Balls away  And hov'ring Vulturs scream around their Prey  Me  Greece  shall honour when I meet my Doom  With solemn Fun'rals and a lasting Tomb  Then raging with intolerable Smart  He writhes his Body and extracts the Dart  The Dart a Tyde of spouting Gore pursu'd  And gladden'd  Troy  with Sight of hostile Blood  Now Troops on Troops the fainting Chief invade  Forc'd he recedes and loudly calls for Aid  Thrice to its pitch his lofty Voice he rears  The wellknown Voice thrice  Menelaus  hears  Alarm'd to  Ajax Telamon  he cry'd  Who shares his Labours and defends his side  O Friend  Ulysses'  Shouts invade my Ear  Distress'd he seems and no Assistance near  Strong as he is yet one oppos'd to all  Oppress'd by Multitudes the best may fall  Greece  robb'd of him must bid her Hosts despair  And feel a Loss not Ages can repair  Then where the Cry directs his Course he bends  Great  Ajax  like the God of War attends  The prudent Chief in sore Distress they found  With Bands of furious  Trojans  compass'd round  As when some Huntsman with a flying Spear  From the blind Thicket wounds a stately Deer  Down his cleft Side while fresh the Blood distills  He bounds aloft and scuds from Hills to Hills  Till Life's warm Vapour issuing thro' the Wound  Wild MountainWolves the fainting Beast surround  Just as their Jaws his prostrate Limbs invade  The Lion rushes thro' the woodland Shade  The Wolves tho' hungry scour dispers'd away  The Lordly Savage vindicates his Prey  Ulysses  thus unconquer'd by his Pains  A single Warrior half an Host sustains  But soon as  Ajax  heaves his Tow'rlike Shield  The scatter'd Crowds fly frighted o'er the Field  Atrides'  Arm the sinking Hero stays  And sav'd from Numbers to his Car conveys  Victorious  Ajax  plies the routed Crew  And first  Doryclus Priam  's Son he slew  On strong  Pandocus  next inflicts a Wound  And lays  Lysander  bleeding on the Ground  As when a Torrent swell'd with wintry Rains  Pours from the Mountains o'er the delug'd Plains  And Pines and Oaks from their Foundations torn  A Country's Ruins to the Seas are born  Fierce  Ajax  thus o'erwhelms the yielding Throng  Men Steeds and Chariots roll in Heaps along  But  Hector  from this Scene of Slaughter far  Rag'd on the left and rul'd the Tyde of War  Loud Groans proclaim his Progress thro' the Plain  And deep  Scamander  swells with Heaps of Slain  There  Nestor  and  Idomeneus  oppose  The Warrior's Fury there the Battel glows  There fierce on Foot or from the Chariot's Height  His Sword deforms the beauteous Ranks of Fight  The Spouse of  Helen  dealing Darts around  Had pierc'd  Machaon  with a distant Wound  In his right Shoulder the broad Shaft appear'd  And trembling  Greece  for her Physician fear'd  To  Nestor  then  Idomeneus  begun  Glory of  Greece  old  Neleus'  valiant Son  Ascend thy Chariot haste with speed away  And great  Machaon  to the Ships convey  A wise Physician skill'd our Wounds to heal  Is more than Armies to the publick Weal  Old  Nestor  mounts the Seat Beside him rode  The wounded Offspring of the healing God  He lends the Lash the Steeds with sounding Feet  Shake the dry Field and thunder tow'rd the Fleet  But now  Cebriones  from  Hector  's Car  Survey'd the various Fortune of the War  While here he cry'd the flying  Greeks  are slain  Trojans  on  Trojans  yonder load the Plain  Before great  Ajax  see the mingled Throng  Of Men and Chariots driv'n in Heaps along  I know him well distinguish'd o'er the Field  By the broad glitt'ring of the sev'nfold Shield  Thither O  Hector  thither urge thy Steeds  There Danger calls and there the Combat bleeds  There Horse and Foot in mingled Deaths unite  And Groans of Slaughter mix with Shouts of Fight  Thus having spoke the Driver's Lash resounds  Swift thro' the Ranks the rapid Chariot bounds  Stung by the Stroke the Coursers scour the Fields  O'er Heaps of Carcasses and Hills of Shields  The Horses Hoofs are bath'd in Heroes Gore  And dashing purple all the Car before  The groaning Axle sable Drops distills  And mangled Carnage clogs the rapid Wheels  Here  Hector  plunging thro' the thickest Fight  Broke the dark  Phalanx  and let in the Light  By the long Lance the Sword or pondrous Stone  The Ranks lie scatter'd and the Troops o'erthrown  Ajax  he shuns thro' all the dire Debate  And fears that Arm whose Force he felt so late  But partial  Jove  espousing  Hector  's Part  Shot heav'nbred Horror thro' the  Grecian  's Heart  Confus'd unnerv'd in  Hector  's Presence grown  Amaz'd he stood with Terrors not his own  O'er his broad Back his moony Shield he threw  And glaring round by tardy Steps withdrew  Thus the grim Lion his Retreat maintains  Beset with watchful Dogs and shouting Swains  Repuls'd by Numbers from the nightly Stalls  Tho' Rage impells him and tho' Hunger calls  Long stands the show'ring Darts and missile Fires  Then sow'rly slow th' indignant Beast retires  So turn'd stern  Ajax  by whole Hosts repell'd  While his swoln Heart at ev'ry Step rebell'd  As the slow Beast with heavy Strength indu'd  In some wide Field by Troops of Boys pursu'd  Tho' round his Sides a wooden Tempest rain  Crops the tall Harvest and lays waste the Plain  Thick on his Hide the hollow Blows resound  The patient Animal maintains his Ground  Scarce from the Field with all their Efforts chas'd  And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last  On  Ajax  thus a Weight of  Trojans  hung  The Strokes redoubled on his Buckler rung  Confiding now in bulky Strength he stands  Now turns and backward bears the yielding Bands  Now stiff recedes yet hardly seems to fly  And threats his Followers with retorted Eye  Fix'd as the Bar between two warring Pow'rs  While hissing Darts descend in Iron Show'rs  In his broad Buckler many a Weapon stood  Its Surface bristled with a quiv'ring Wood  And many a Javelin guiltless on the Plain  Drinks the dry Dust and thirsts for Blood in vain  But bold  Eurypylus  his Aid imparts  And dauntless springs beneath a Cloud of Darts  Whose eager Javelin launch'd against the Foe  Great  Apisaon  felt the fatal Blow  From his torn Liver the red Current flow'd  And his slack Knees desert their dying Load  The Victor rushing to despoil the Dead  From  Paris'  Bow a vengeful Arrow fled  Fix'd in his nervous Thigh the Weapon stood  Fix'd was the Point but broken was the Wood  Back to the Lines the wounded  Greek  retir'd  Yet thus retreating his Associates fir'd  What God O  Grecians  has your Hearts dismay'd  Oh turn to Arms 'tis  Ajax  claims your Aid  This Hour he stands the Mark of hostile Rage  And this the last brave Battel he shall wage  Haste join your Forces from the gloomy Grave  The Warrior rescue and your Country save  Thus urg'd the Chief a gen'rous Troop appears  Who spread their Bucklers and advance their Spears  To guard their wounded Friend While thus they stand  With pious Care great  Ajax  joins the Band  Each takes new Courage at the Hero's Sight  The Hero rallies and renews the Fight  Thus rag'd both Armies like conflicting Fires  While  Nestor  's Chariot far from Fight retires  His Coursers steep'd in Sweat and stain'd with Gore  The  Greeks  Preserver great  Machaon  bore  That Hour  Achilles  from the topmost Height  Of his proud Fleet o'erlook'd the Fields of Fight  His feasted Eyes beheld around the Plain  The  Grecian  Rout the slaying and the slain  His Friend  Machaon  singled from the rest  A transient Pity touch'd his vengeful Breast  Strait to  Maenetius'  muchlov'd Son he sent  Graceful as  Mars Patroclus  quits his Tent  In evil Hour Then Fate decreed his Doom  And fix'd the Date of all his Woes to come  Why calls my Friend thy lov'd Injunctions lay  Whate'er thy Will  Patroclus  shall obey  O first of Friends  Pelides  thus reply'd  Still at my Heart and ever at my Side  The Time is come when yon' despairing Host  Shall learn the Value of the Man they lost  Now at my Knees the  Greeks  shall pour their Moan  And proud  Atrides  tremble on his Throne  Go now to  Nestor  and from him be taught  What wounded Warrior late his Chariot brought  For seen at distance and but seen behind  His Form recall'd  Machaon  to my Mind  Nor could I thro' yon' Cloud discern his Face  The Coursers past me with so swift a Pace  The Hero said His Friend obey'd with haste  Thro' intermingled Ships and Tents he past  The Chiefs descending from their Car he found  The panting Steeds  Eurymedon  unbound  The Warriors standing on the breezy Shore  To dry their Sweat and wash away the Gore  Here paus'd a moment while the gentle Gale  Convey'd that Freshness the cool Seas exhale  Then to consult on farther Methods went  And took their Seats beneath the shady Tent  The Draught prescrib'd fair  Hecamede  prepares  Arsinous'  Daughter grac'd with golden Hairs  Whom to his aged Arms a Royal Slave  Greece  as the Prize of  Nestor  's Wisdom gave  A Table first with azure Feet she plac'd  Whose ample Orb a brazen Charger grac'd  Honey newpress'd the sacred Flow'r of Wheat  And wholsome Garlick crown'd the sav'ry Treat  Next her white Hand an antique Goblet brings  A Goblet sacred to the  Pylian  Kings  From eldest Times emboss'd with Studs of Gold  Two Feet support it and four Handles hold  On each bright Handle bending o'er the Brink  In sculptur'd Gold two Turtles seem to drink  A massy Weight yet heav'd with ease by him  When the brisk Nectar overlook'd the Brim  Temper'd in this the Nymph of Form divine  Pours a large Potion of the  Pramnian  Wine  With Goat'smilk Cheese a flav'rous Taste bestows  And last with Flour the smiling Surface strows  This for the wounded Prince the Dame prepares  The cordial Bev'rage rev'rend  Nestor  shares  Salubrious Draughts the Warrior's Thirst allay  And pleasing Conference beguiles the Day  Mean time  Patroclus  by  Achilles  sent  Unheard approach'd and stood before the Tent  Old  Nestor  rising then the Hero led  To his high Seat the Chief refus'd and said  'Tis now no Season for these kind Delays  The great  Achilles  with Impatience stays  To great  Achilles  this Respect I owe  Who asks what Hero wounded by the Foe  Was born from combat by thy foaming Steeds  With Grief I see the great  Machaon  bleeds  This to report my hasty Course I bend  Thou know'st the fiery Temper of my Friend  Can then the Sons of  Greece  the Sage rejoin'd  Excite Compassion in  Achilles'  Mind  Seeks he the Sorrows of our Host to know  This is not half the Story of our Woe  Tell him not great  Machaon  bleeds alone  Our bravest Heroes in the Navy groan  Ulysses Agamemnon Diomed  And stern  Eurypylus  already bleed  But ah what flatt'ring Hopes I entertain  Achilles  heeds not but derides our Pain  Ev'n till the Flames consume our Fleet he stays  And waits the rising of the fatal Blaze  Chief after Chief the raging Foe destroys  Calm he looks on and ev'ry Death enjoys  Now the slow Course of allimpairing Time  Unstrings my Nerves and ends my manly Prime  Oh had I still that Strength my Youth possess'd  When this bold Arm th'  Epeian  Pow'rs oppress'd  The Bulls of  Elis  in glad Triumph led  And stretch'd the great  Itymonaeus  dead  Then from my Fury fled the trembling Swains  And ours was all the Plunder of the Plains  Fifty white Flocks full fifty Herds of Swine  As many Goats as many lowing Kine  And thrice the Number of unrival'd Steeds  All teeming Females and of gen'rous Breeds  These as my first Essay of Arms I won  Old  Neleus  glory'd in his conqu'ring Son  Thus  Elis  forc'd her long Arrears restor'd  And Shares were parted to each  Pylian  Lord  The State of  Pyle  was sunk to last Despair  When the proud  Elians  first commenc'd the War  For  Neleus'  Sons  Alcides'  Rage had slain  Of twelve bold Brothers I alone remain  Oppress'd we arm'd and now this Conquest gain'd  My Sire three hundred chosen Sheep obtain'd  That large Reprizal he might justly claim  For Prize defrauded and insulted Fame  When  Elis'  Monarch in the publick Course  Detain'd his Chariot and victorious Horse  The rest the People shar'd my self survey'd  The just Partition and due Victims pay'd  Three Days were past when  Elis  rose to War  With many a Courser and with many a Car  The Sons of  Actor  at their Army's Head  Young as they were the vengeful Squadrons led  High on a Rock fair  Thryoëssa  stands  Our utmost Frontier on the  Pylian  Lands  Not far the Streams of fam'd  Alphaeus  flow  The Stream they pass'd and pitch'd their Tents below  Pallas  descending in the Shades of Night  Alarms the  Pylians  and commands the Fight  Each burns for Fame and swells with martial Pride  My self the foremost but my Sire deny'd  Fear'd for my Youth expos'd to stern Alarms  And stopp'd my Chariot and detain'd my Arms  My Sire deny'd in vain On foot I fled  Amidst our Chariots For the Goddess led  Along fair  Arene  's delightful Plain  Soft  Minyas  rolls his Waters to the Main  There Horse and Foot the  Pylian  Troops unite  And sheath'd in Arms expect the dawning Light  Thence e'er the Sun advanc'd his noonday Flame  To great  Alphaeus'  sacred Source we came  There first to  Jove  our solemn Rites were paid  An untam'd Heifer pleas'd the blueey'd Maid  A Bull  Alphaeus  and a Bull was slain  To the blue Monarch of the wat'ry Main  In Arms we slept beside the winding Flood  While round the Town the fierce  Epeians  stood  Soon as the Sun with allrevealing Ray  Flam'd in the Front of Heav'n and gave the Day  Bright Scenes of Arms and Works of War appear  The Nations meet there  Pylos Elis  here  The first who fell beneath my Javelin bled  King  Augias'  Son and Spouse of  Agamede  She that all Simple's healing Virtues knew  And ev'ry Herb that drinks the Morning Dew  I seiz'd his Car the Van of Battel led  Th'  Epeians  saw they trembled and they fled  The Foe dispers'd their bravest Warrior kill'd  Fierce as a Whirlwind now I swept the Field  Full fifty captive Chariots grac'd my Train  Two Chiefs from each fell breathless to the Plain  Then  Actor  's Sons had dy'd but  Neptune  shrouds  The youthful Heroes in a Veil of Clouds  O'er heapy Shields and o'er the prostrate Throng  Collecting Spoils and slaught'ring all along  Thro' wide  Buprasian  Fields we forc'd the Foes  Where o'er the Vales th'  Olenian  Rocks arose  Till  Pallas  stopp'd us where  Alisium  flows  Ev'n there the hindmost of their Rear I slay  And the same Arm that led concludes the Day  Then back to  Pyle  triumphant take my way  There to high  Jove  were publick Thanks assign'd  As first of Gods to  Nestor  of Mankind  Such then I was impell'd by youthful Blood  So prov'd my Valour for my Country's Good  Achilles  with unactive Fury glows  And gives to Passion what to  Greece  he owes  How shall he grieve when to th' eternal Shade  Her Hosts shall sink nor his the Pow'r to aid  O Friend my Memory recalls the Day  When gath'ring Aids along the  Grecian  Sea  I and  Ulysses  touch'd at  Pthia  's Port  And enter'd  Peleus'  hospitable Court  A Bull to  Jove  he slew in sacrifice  And pour'd Libations on the flaming Thighs  Thy self  Achilles  and thy rev'rend Sire  Menoetius  turn'd the Fragments on the Fire  Achilles  sees us to the Feast invites  Social we sit and share the genial Rites  We then explain'd the Cause on which we came  Urg'd you to Arms and found you fierce for Fame  Your ancient Fathers gen'rous Precepts gave  Peleus  said only this"My Son be brave  Menoetius  thus "Tho' great  Achilles  shine  "In Strength superior and of Race divine  "Yet cooler Thoughts thy elder Years attend  "Let thy just Counsels aid and rule thy Friend  Thus spoke your Father at  Thessalia  's Court  Words now forgot tho' now of vast Import  Ah try the utmost that a Friend can say  Such gentle Force the fiercest Minds obey  Some fav'ring God  Achilles'  Heart may move  Tho' deaf to Glory he may yield to Love  If some dire

Proud  Troy  may tremble and desist from War  Press'd by fresh Forces her o'erlabour'd Train  Shall seek their Walls and  Greece  respire again  This touch'd his gen'rous Heart and from the Tent  Along the Shore with hasty Strides he went  Soon as he came where on the crouded Strand  The publick Mart and Courts of Justice stand  Where the tall Fleet of great  Ulysses  lies  And Altars to the guardian Gods arife  There sad he met the brave  Evaemon  's Son  Large painful Drops from all his Members run  An Arrow's Head yet rooted in his Wound  The fable Blood in Circles mark'd the Ground  As faintly reeling he confess'd the Smart  Weak was his Pace but dauntless was his Heart  Divine Compassion touch'd  Patroclus'  Breast  Who sighing thus his bleeding Friend addrest  Ah hapless Leaders of the  Grecian  Host  Thus must ye perish on a barb'rous Coast  Is this your Fate to glut the Dogs with Gore  Far from your Friends and from your native Shore  Say great  Eurypylus  shall  Greece  yet stand  Resists she yet the raging  Hector  's Hand  Or are her Heroes doom'd to die with Shame  And this the Period of our Wars and Fame  Eurypylus  replies No more my Friend  Greece  is

sage  Chiron  Sire of  Pharmacy  Once taught  Achilles  and  Achilles  thee  Of two fam'd Surgeons  Podalirius  stands  This Hour surrounded by the  Trojan  Bands  And great  Machaon  wounded in his Tent  Now wants that Succour which so oft' he lent  To him the Chief What then remains to do  Th' Event of Things the Gods alone can view  Charg'd by  Achilles'  great Command I fly  And bear with haste the  Pylian  King's Reply  But thy Distress this Instant claims Relief  He said and in his Arms upheld the Chief  The Slaves their Master's slow Approach survey'd  And Hides of Oxen on the Floor display'd  There stretch'd at length the wounded Hero lay  Patroclus  cut the forky Steel away  Then in his Hands a bitter Root he bruis'd  The Wound he wash'd the Styptick Juice infus'd  The closing Flesh that Instant ceas'd to glow  The Wound to torture and the Blood to flow  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Eleventh Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE ELEVENTH BOOK  I  AS  Homer  's Invention is in nothing more wonderful than in the great Variety of Characters with which his Poems are diversify'd so his Judgment appears in nothing more exact than in that Propriety with which each Character is maintain'd But this Exactness must be collected by a diligent Attention to his Conduct thro' the whole and when the Particulars of each Character are laid together we shall find them all proceeding from the same Temper and Disposition of the Person If this Observation be neglected the Poet's Conduct will lose much of its true Beauty and Harmony  I fancy it will not be unpleasant to the Reader to consider the Picture of  Agamemnon  drawn by so masterly an Hand as that of  Homer  in its full length after having seen him in several Views and Lights since the beginning of the Poem  He is a Master of Policy and Stratagem and maintains a good Understanding with his Council which was but necessary considering how many different and independent Nations and Interests he had to manage He seems fully conscious of his own superior Authority and always knows the time when to exert it He is personally very valiant but not without some Mixture of Fierceness Highly resentful of the Injuries done  his Family even more than  Menelaus  himself Warm both in his Passions and Affections particularly in the Love he bears his Brother In short he is as  Homer  himself in another Place describes him both a good King and a great Warrior  It is very observable how this Hero rises in the Eye and Esteem of the Reader as the Poem advances It opens with many Circumstances very much to the Disadvantage of his Character he insults the Priest of  Apollo  and outrages  Achilles  but in the second Book he grows sensible of the Effects of his Rashness and takes the Fault entirely upon himself In the fourth he shews himself a skilful Commander by exhorting reproving and performing all the Offices of a good General In the eighth he is deeply touch'd by the Sufferings of his Army and makes all the Peoples Calamities his own In the ninth he endeavours to reconcile himself to  Achilles  and condescends to be the Petitioner because it is for the publick Good In the tenth finding those Endeavours ineffectual his Concern keeps him the whole Night awake in contriving all possible Methods to assist them And now in the eleventh as it were resolving himself to supply the want of  Achilles  he grows prodigiously in his Valour and performs Wonders in his single Person  Thus we see  Agamemnon  continually winning upon our Esteem as we grow acquainted with him so that he seems to be like that Goddess the Poet describes who was low at the first but rising by degrees at last reaches the very Heavens  II  VERSE  When baleful  Eris c  With what a wonderful Sublimity does the Poet begin this Book He awakens the Reader's Curiosity and sounds an Alarm to the approaching Battel With what Magnificence does he usher in the Deeds of  Agamemnon  He seems for a while to have lost all  view of the main Battel and lets the whole Action of the Po'em stand still to attend the Motions of this single Hero Instead of an Herald he brings down a Goddess to inflame the Army instead of a Trumpet or such warlike Musick  Juno  and  Minerva  thunder over the Field of Battel  Jove  rains down Drops of Blood and averts his Eyes from such a Scene of Horrors  By the Goddess  Eris  is meant that Ardour and Impatience for the Battel which now inspir'd the  Grecian  Army They who just before were almost in Despair now burn for the Fight and breath nothing but War  Eustathius  III  VERSE Orthian  Song    This is a kind of an  Odaic  Song invented and sung on purpose to fire the Soul to noble Deeds in War Such was that of  Timotheus  before  Alexander the Great  which had such an Influence upon him that he leap'd from his Seat and laid hold on his Arms  Eustathius  IV  VERSE  King  Cinyras  'Tis probable this Passage of  Cinyras  King of  Cyprus  alludes to a true History and what makes it the more so is that this Island was famous for its Mines of several Metals  Eustathius  V  VERSE  Arching bow'd  c  Eustathius  observes that the Poet intended to represent the bending Figure of these Serpents as well as their Colour by comparing them to Rainbows  Dacier  observes here how close a Parallel this Passage of  Homer  bears to that in  Genesis  where God tells  Noah I have set my Bow in the Clouds that it may be for a Sign of the Covenant between me and the Earth  VI  VERSE  The Foot and those who wield The lighter Arms rush forward    Here we see the Order of Battel is inverted and opposite to that which  Nestor  proposed in the fourth Book For it is the Cavalry which is there sustain'd by the Infantry here the Infantry by the Cavalry But to deliver my Opinion I believe it was the Nearness of the Enemy that obliged  Agamemnon  to change the Disposition of the Battel He would break their Battalions with his Infantry and complete their Defeat by his Cavalry which should fall upon the Flyers  Dacier  VII  VERSE  Red Drops of Blood    These Prodigies with which  Homer  embellishes his Poetry are the same with those which History relates not as Ornaments but as Truths Nothing is more common in History than Showers of Blood and Philosophy gives us the Reason of them The two Battels which had been fought on the Plains of  Troy  had so drench'd them with Blood that a great Quantity of it might be exhal'd in Vapours and carry'd into the Air and being there condens'd fall down again in Dews and Drops of the same Colour  Eustathius  VIII  VERSE  As the red Star    We have just seen at full length the Picture of the General of the  Greeks  Here we see  Hector  beautifully drawn in Miniature This proceeded from the great Judgment of the Poet 'twas necessary to speak fully of  Agamemnon  who was to be the chief Hero of this Battel and briefly of  Hector  who had so often been spoken of at large before This is an Instance that the Poet well knew when to be concise and when to be copious It is impossible that any thing should be more happily imagin'd than this Similitude It is so lively that we see  Hector  sometimes shining in Arms at the Head of his Troops and then immediately lose Sight of him while he retires in the Ranks of the Army  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  As sweating Reapers    'Twill be necessary for the understanding of this Similitude to explain the Method of Mowing in  Homer  's Days They mowed in the same manner as they plowed beginning at the Extremes of the Field which was equally divided and proceeding till they met in the middle of it By this means they rais'd an Emulation between both Parties which should finish their Share first If we consider this Custom we shall find it a very happy Comparison to the two Armies advancing against each other together with an exact Resemblance in every Circumstance the Poet intended to illustrate  X  VERSE  What time in some sequester'd Vale The weary Woodman  c  One may gather from hence that in  Homer  's Time they did not measure the Day by Hours but by the Progression of the Sun and distinguish'd the Parts of it by the most noted Employments as in the of the  Odysseis  ℣ from the rising of the Judges and here from the dining of the Labourer  It may perhaps be entertaining to the Reader to see a general Account of the Mensuration of Time among the Ancients which I shall take from  Spondanus  At the beginning of the World it is certain there was no Distinction of Time but by the Light and Darkness and the whole Day was included in the general Terms of the Evening and the Morning  Munster  makes a pretty Observation upon this Custom Our longliv'd Forefathers says he had not so much occasion to be exact Observers how the Day pass'd as their frailer Sons whose Shortness of Life makes it necessary to distinguish every Part of Time and suffer none of it to slip away without their Observation  It is not improbable but that the  Chaldaeans  many Ages after the Flood were the first who divided the Day into Hours they being the first who applied themselves with any Success to Astrology The most ancient Sundial we read of is that of  Achaz  mention'd in the second Book of Kings Ch about the Time of the building of  Rome  But as these were of no use on clouded Days and in the Night there was another Invention of measuring the Parts of Time by Water but that not being sufficiently exact they laid it aside for another by Sand  'Tis certain the Use of Dials was earlier among the  Greeks  than the  Romans  'twas above three hundred Years after the building of  Rome  before they knew any thing of them But yet they had divided the Day and Night into twenty four Hours as appears from  Varro  and  Macrobius  tho' they did not count the Hours as we do numerically but from Midnight to Midnight and distinguish'd them by particular Names as by the Cock crowing the Dawn the Midday  c  The first Sundial we read of among the  Romans  which divided the Day into Hours is mention'd by  Pliny lib    cap  fixt upon the Temple of  Quirinus  by  L Papyrius  the Censor about the  th  Year of the Wars with  Pyrrhus  But the first that was of any Use to the Publick was set up near the  Rostra  in the  Forum  by  Valerius Messala  the Consul after the taking of  Catana  in  Sicily  from whence it was brought thirty Years after the first had been set up by  Papyrius  but this was still an imperfect one the Lines of it not exactly corresponding with the several Hours Yet they made use of it many Years till  Q Marcius Philippus  placed another by it greatly improved but these had still one common Defect of being useless in the Night and when the Skies were overcast All these Inventions being thus ineffectual  Scipio Nasica  some Years afterwards measur'd the Day and Night into Hours from the dropping of Water  Yet near this time it may be gather'd that Sundials were very frequent in  Rome  from a Fragment preserv'd by  Aulus Gellius  and ascrib'd to  Plautus  The Lines are so beautiful that I cannot deny the Reader the Satisfaction of seeing them They are supposed to be spoken by an hungry Parasite  upon a Sight of one of these Dials  Ut illum Dii perdant primus qui horas repperit  Quique adeo primus statuit heic solarium  Qui mihi comminuit misero articulatim diem  Nam me puero uterus hic erat solarium  Multo omnium istorum optimum verissumum  Ubi iste monebat esse nisi cum nihil erat  Nunc etiam quod est non est nisi Soli lubet  Itaque adeo jam oppletum est oppidum solariis  Major pars populi aridi reptant fame  We find frequent mention of the  Hours  in the Course of this Poem but to prevent any Mistake it may not be improper to take notice that they must always be understood to mean the Seasons and not the Division of the Day by Hours  XI  VERSE  The  Greeks  impulsive Might    We had just before seen that all the Gods were withdrawn from the Battel that  Jupiter  was resolv'd even against the Inclinations of them all to honour the  Trojans  Yet we here see the  Greeks  breaking thro' them The Love the Poet bears to his Countrymen makes him aggrandize their Valour and overrule even the Decrees of Fate To vary his Battels he supposes the Gods to be absent this Day and they are no sooner gone but the Courage of the  Greeks  prevails even against the Determination of  Jupiter Eustathius  XII  VERSE  Naked to the Sky    Eustathius  refines upon this Place and believes that  Homer  intended by particularizing the Whiteness of the Limbs to ridicule the effeminate Education of these unhappy Youths But as such an Interpretation may be thought below the Majesty of an Epic Poem and a kind of Barbarity to insult the unfortunate I thought it better to give the Passage an Air of Compassion As the  Words are equally capable of either meaning I imagin'd the Reader would be more pleas'd with the Humanity of the one than with the Satyr of the other  XIII  VERSE  These on the Mountains once  Achilles  found    Homer  says  Eustathius  never lets any Opportunity pass of mentioning the Hero of his Poem  Achilles  He gives here an Instance of his former Resentment and at once varies his Poetry and exalts his Character Nor does he mention him cursorily he seems unwilling to leave him and when he pursues the Thread of the Story in a few Lines takes occasion to speak again of him This is a very artful Conduct by mentioning him so frequently he takes care that the Reader should not forget him and shews the Importance of that Hero whose Anger is the Subject of his Poem  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Antimachus  who once in Council stood  To shed  Ulysses  and my Brother's Blood    'Tis observable that  Homer  with a great deal of Art interweaves the true History of the  Trojan  War in his Poem He here gives a Circumstance that carries us back from the tenth Year of the War to the very beginning of it So that altho' the Action of the Poem takes up but a small Part of the last Year of the War yet by such Incidents as these we are taught a great many Particulars that happen thro' the whole Series of it  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  Lopp'd his Hands away    I think one cannot but compassionate the Fate of these Brothers who suffer for the Sins of their Father notwithstanding the Justice which the Commentators find in this Action of  Agamemnon  And I can much less imagine that his cutting off their Hands was  meant for an express Example against Bribery in Revenge for the Gold which  Antimachus  had received from  Paris Eustathius  is very refining upon this Point but the grave  Spondanus  outdoes them all who has found there was an excellent Conceit in cutting off the Hands and Head of the Son the first because the Father had been for  laying Hands  on the  Grecian Embassadors  and the second because it was from his  Head  that the Advice proceeded of detaining  Helena  XVI  VERSE  Now by the Foot the flying Foot  c  After  Homer  with a poetical Justice has punish'd the Sons of  Antimachus  for the Crimes of the Father he carries on the Narration and presents all the Terrors of the Battel to our view We see in the lively Description the Men and Chariots overthrown and hear the Tramplings of the Horses Feet Thus the Poet very artfully by such sudden Alarms awakens the Attention of the Reader that is apt to be tired and grow remiss by a plain and more cool Narration  XVII  VERSE  The Brasshoof'd Steeds    Eustathius  observes that the Custom of shoeing Horses was in use in  Homer  's Time and calls the Shoes  from the Figure of an HalfMoon  XVIII  VERSE  More grateful now to Vulturs than their Wives    This is a Reflection of the Poet and such an one as arises from a Sentiment of Compassion and indeed there is nothing more moving than to see those Heroes who were the Love and Delight of their Spouses reduc'd suddenly to such a Condition of Horror that their very Wives dare not look upon them I was very much surprized to find a Remark of  Eustathius  upon this which seems very wrong and unjust He  would have it that there is in this Place an  Ellipsis  "For says he which comprehends a severe Raillery  Homer  would imply that those dead Warriors were now more agreeable to Vulturs than they had ever been in all their Days to their Wives  This is very ridiculous to suppose that these unhappy Women did not love their Husbands is to insult them barbarously in their Affliction and every Body can see that such a Thought in this Place would have appear'd mean frigid and out of Season  Homer  always endeavours to excite Compassion by the Grief of the Wives whose Husbands are kill'd in the Battel  Dacier  XIX  VERSE  Now past the Tomb where ancient  Ilus  lay    By the Exactness of  Homer  's Description we see as in a Landscape the very Place where this Battel was fought  Agamemnon  drives the  Trojans  from the Tomb of  Ilus  where they encamp'd all the Night that Tomb stood in the middle of the Plain From thence he pursues them by the wild FigTree to the BeechTree and from thence to the very  Scaean  Gate Thus the Scene of Action is fix'd and we see the very Rout through which the one retreats and the other advances  Eustathius  XX  VERSE Iris  with haste thy golden Wings display    'Tis evident that some such Contrivance as this was necessary The  Trojans  we learn from the beginning of this Book were to be victorious this Day But if  Jupiter  had not now interpos'd they had been driven even within the Walls of  Troy  By this means also the Poet consults both for the Honour of  Hector  and that of  Agamemnon Agamemnon  has time enough to shew the Greatness of his Valour and it is no Disgrace to  Hector  not to encounter him when  Jupiter  interposes  Eustathius  observes that the Poet gives us here a Sketch of what is drawn out at large in the Story of this whole Book  This he does to raise the Curiosity of the Reader and make him impatient to hear those great Actions which must be perform'd before  Agamemnon  can retire and  Hector  be victorious  XXI  VERSE  Ye sacred Nine    The Poet to win the Attention of the Reader and seeming himself to be struck with the Exploits of  Agamemnon  while he recites them who when the Battel was rekindled rushes out to engage his Enemies invokes not one Muse as he did in the beginning of the Poem but as if he intended to warn us that he was about to relate something surprizing he invokes the whole Nine and then as if he had received their Inspiration goes on to deliver what they suggested to him By means of this Apostrophe the Imagination of the Reader is so fill'd that he seems not only present but active in the Scene to which the Skill of the Poet has transported him  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE Iphidamas  the bold and young    Homer  here gives us the History of this  Iphidamas  his Parentage the Place of his Birth and many Circumstances of his private Life This he does to diversify his Poetry and to soften with some amiable Embellishments the continual Horrors that must of Necessity strike the Imagination in an uninterrupted Narration of Blood and Slaughter  Eustathius  XXIII  VERSE Theano  's Sister    That the Reader may not be shock'd at the Marriage of  Iphidamas  with his Mother's Sister it may not be amiss to observe from  Eustathius  that Consanguinity was no Impediment in  Greece  in the Days of  Homer  Nor is  Iphidamas  singular in this kind of Marriage for  Diomed  was married to his own Aunt as well as he  XXIV  VERSE  The fierce  Ilythiae  These  Ilythiae  are the Goddesses that  Homer  supposes to preside over ChildBirth He arms their Hands with a kind of an Instrument from which a pointed Dart is shot into the distressed Mother as an Arrow is from a Bow So that as  Eris  has her Torch and  Jupiter  his Thunder these Goddesses have their Darts which they shoot into Women in Travail He calls them the Daughters of  Juno  because she presides over the MarriageBed  Eustathius  Here says  Dacier  we find the Style of the holy Scripture which to express a severe Pain usually compares it to that of Women in Labour Thus  David Pain came upon them as upon a Woman in Travail  and  Isaiah They shall grieve as a Woman in Travail  and all the Prophets are full of the like Expressions  XXV  VERSE  Lo angry  Jove  forbids your Chief to stay    Eustathius  remarks upon the Behaviour of  Agamemnon  in his present Distress  Homer  describes him as rack'd with almost intolerable Pains yet he does not complain of the Anguish he suffers but that he is obliged to retire from the Fight  This indeed as it prov'd his undaunted Spirit so did it likewise his Wisdom Had he shew'd any unmanly Dejection it would have dispirited the Army but his Intrepidity makes them believe his Wound less dangerous and renders them not so highly concern'd for the Absence of their General  XXVI  VERSE  Say Muse when  Jove  the  Trojan  's Glory crown'd    The Poet just before has given us an Invocation of the Muses to make us attentive to the great Exploits of  Agamemnon  Here we have one with regard to  Hector  but this last may perhaps be more easily accounted for than the  other For in that after so solemn an Invocation we might reasonably have expected Wonders from the Hero whereas in Reality he kills but one Man before he himself is wounded and what he does afterwards seems to proceed from a frantic Valour arising from the Smart of the Wound We do not find by the Text that he kills one Man but overthrows several in his Fury and then retreats So that one would imagine he invoked the Muses only to describe his Retreat  But upon a nearer view we shall find that  Homer  shews a commendable Partiality to his own Countryman and Hero  Agamemnon  He seems to detract from the Greatness of  Hector  's Actions by ascribing them to  Jupiter  whereas  Agamemnon  conquers by the Dint of Bravery And that this is a just Observation will appear by what follows Those  Greeks  that fall by the Sword of  Hector  he passes over as if they were all vulgar Men He says nothing of them but that they dy'd and only briefly mentions their Names as if he endeavour'd to conceal the Overthrow of the  Greeks  But when he speaks of his favourite General  Agamemnon  he expatiates and dwells upon his Actions and shews us that those that fell by his Hand were all Men of Distinction such as were the Sons of  Priam  of  Antenor  and  Antimachus  'Tis true  Hector  kill'd as many Leaders of the  Greeks  as  Agamemnon  of the  Trojans  and more of the common Soldiers but by particularizing the Deaths of the Chiefs of  Troy  he sets the Deeds of  Agamemnon  in the strongest Point of Light and by his Silence in respect to the Leaders whom  Hector  slew he casts a Shade over the Greatness of the Action and consequently it appears less conspicuous  XXVII  VERSE  But wise  Ulysses  call'd  Tydides  forth    There is something instructive in the most seemingly common Passages of  Homer  who by making the wise  Ulysses  direct the brave  Diomed  in all the Enterprizes of the last Book and by maintaining the same Conduct in this intended to shew this Moral that Valour should always be under the Guidance of  Wisdom Thus in the eighth Book when  Diomed  could scarce be restrain'd by the Thunder of  Jupiter Nestor  is at hand to moderate his Courage and this Hero seems to have made a very good use of those Instructions his Valour no longer runs out into Rashness tho' he is too brave to decline the Fight yet he is too wise to fight against  Jupiter  XXVIII  VERSE  Great  Diomed  himself was seiz'd with Fear    There seems to be some Difficulty in these Words This brave Warrior who has frequently met  Hector  in the Battel and offer'd himself for the single Combat is here said to be seiz'd with Fear at the very Sight of him This may be thought not to agree with his usual Behaviour and to derogate from the general Character of his Intrepidity But we must remember that  Diomed  himself has but just told us that  Jupiter  fought against the  Grecians  and that all the Endeavours of himself and  Ulysses  would be in vain This Fear therefore of  Diomed  is far from being dishonourable it is not  Hector  but  Jupiter  of whom he is afraid  Eustathius  XXIX  VERSE Ilus'  Monument    I thought it necessary just to put the Reader in mind that the Battel still continues near the Tomb of  Ilus  By a just Observation of that we may with Pleasure see the various Turns of the Fight and how every Step of Ground is won or lost as the Armies are repuls'd or victorious  XXX  VERSE  Just as he stoop'd  Agastrophus  's Crest  To seize and draw the Corselet from his Breast    One would think that the Poet at all times endeavour'd to condemn the Practice of stripping the Dead during the Heat of Action He frequently describes the Victor wounded while  he is so employ'd about the Bodies of the slain Thus in the present Book we see  Agamemnon Diomed Ulysses Elephenor  and  Eurypylus  all suffer as they strip the Men they slew and in the sixth Book he brings in the wise  Nestor  directly forbidding it  Eustathius  XXXI  VERSE  But pierc'd his Foot    It cannot but be a Satisfaction to the Reader to see the Poet smitten with the Love of his Country and at all times consulting its Honour This Day was to be glorious to  Troy  but  Homer  takes care to remove with Honour most of the bravest  Greeks  from the Field of Battel before the  Trojans  can conquer Thus  Agamemnon Diomed  and  Ulysses  must bleed before the Poet can allow his Countrymen to retreat  Eustathius  XXXII  VERSE  The laughing  Trojan  Eustathius  is of Opinion that the Poet intended to satyrize in this Place the unwarlike Behaviour of  Paris  Such an effeminate Laugh and Gesture is unbecoming a brave Warrior but agrees very well with the Character of  Paris  He is before said to be more delighted with the soft amorous Lyre than with the warlike Sound of the Battel Nor do I remember that in the whole Iliad any one Person is describ'd in such an indecent Transport tho' upon a much more glorious or successful Action He concludes his ludicrous Insult with a Circumstance very much to the Honour of  Diomed  and very much to the Disadvantage of his own Character who reveals to an Enemy the Fears of  Troy  and compares the  Greeks  to Lions and the  Trojans  to Sheep  Diomed  is the very reverse of him he despises and lessens the Wound he receiv'd and in the midst of his Pain would not gratify his Enemy with the little Joy he might give him by letting him know it  XXXIII  VERSE  And questions thus his own unconquer'd Soul    This is a Passage which very much strikes me We have here a brave Hero making a noble Soliloquy or rather calling a Council within himself when he was singly to encounter an Army 'Tis impossible for the Reader not to be in Pain for so gallant a Man in such an imminent Danger he must be impatient for the Event and his whole Curiosity must be awaken'd till he knows the Fate of  Ulysses  who scorn'd to fly tho' encompass'd by an Army  XXXIV  VERSE  By  Pallas'  Care    It is a just Observation that there is no Moral so evident or so constantly carry'd on through the Iliad as the Necessity Mankind at all times has of divine Assistance Nothing is perform'd with Success without particular mention of this  Hector  is not sav'd from a Dart without  Apollo  or  Ulysses  without  Minerva Homer  is perpetually acknowledging the Hand of God in all Events and ascribing to that only all the Victories Triumphs Rewards or Punishments of Men Thus the grand Moral he laid down at the Entrance of his Poem    The Will of God was fulfill'd  runs thro' his whole Work and is with a most remarkable Care and Conduct put into the Mouths of his greatest and wisest Persons on every Occasion  Homer  generally makes some peculiar God attend on each Hero For the Ancients believ'd that every Man had his particular Tutelary Deity these in succeeding Times were called  Daemons  or  Genii  who as they thought were given to Men at the Hour of their Birth and directed the whole Course of their Lives See  Cebes  's  Tablet Menander  as he is cited by  Ammianus Marcellinus  styles them    the invisible Guides of Life  XXXV  VERSE  Fam'd Son of  Hippasus  Homer  has been blam'd by some late Censurers for making his Heroes address Discourses to the Dead Passion says  Dacier  dictates these Speeches and it is generally to the dying not to the dead that they are address'd However one may say that they are often rather Reflections than Insults Were it otherwise  Homer  deserves not to be censured for feigning what Histories have reported as Truth We find in  Plutarch  that  Mark Antony  upon Sight of the dead Body of  Brutus  stopp'd and reproach'd him with the Death of his Brother  Caius  whom  Brutus  had kill'd in  Macedonia  in Revenge for the Murder of  Cicero  I must confess I am not altogether pleas'd with the Railleries he sometimes uses to a vanquish'd Warrior which Inhumanities if spoken to the dying would I think be yet worse than after they were dead  XXXVI  VERSE  And hov'ring Vulturs scream around their Prey    This is not literally translated what the Poet says gives us the most lively Picture imaginable of the Vulturs in the Act of tearing their Prey with their Bills They beat the Body with their Wings as they rend it which is a very natural Circumstance but scarce possible to be copy'd by a Translator without losing the Beauty of it  XXXVII  VERSE  Me  Greece  shall honour when I meet my Doom With solemn Funerals    We may see from such Passages as these that Honours paid to the Ashes of the dead have been greatly valued in all Ages This posthumous Honour was paid as a publick Acknowledgment that the Person deceas'd had deserv'd well of his Country and consequently was an Incitement to the living to imitate his Actions In this view there is no Man but would be ambitious of them not as they  are Testimonies of Titles or Riches but of distinguish'd Merit  XXXVIII  VERSE  Great  Ajax  like the God of War attends    The Silence of other Heroes on many Occasions is very beautiful in  Homer  but peculiarly so in  Ajax  who is a gallant rough Soldier and readier to act than to speak The present Necessity of  Ulysses  requir'd such a Behaviour for the least Delay might have been fatal to him  Ajax  therefore complying both with his own Inclinations and the urgent Condition of  Ulysses  makes no Reply to  Menelaus  but immediately hastens to his Relief The Reader will observe how justly the Poet maintains this Character of  Ajax  throughout the whole Iliad who is often silent when he has an Opportunity to speak and when he speaks 'tis like a Soldier with a martial Air and always with Brevity  Eustathius  XXXIX  VERSE  A wise Physician    The Poet passes a very signal Commendation upon Physicians The Army had seen several of the bravest of their Heroes wounded yet were not so much dispirited for them all as they were at the single Danger of  Machaon  But the Person whom he calls a Physician seems rather to be a Surgeon The cutting out of Arrows and applying Anodynes being the Province of the latter However as  Eustathius  says we must conclude that  Machaon  was both a Physician and Surgeon and that those two Professions were practised by one Person  It is reasonable to think from the Frequency of their Wars that the Profession in those Days was chiefly Chirurgical  Celsus  says expressly that the  Diaetetic  was long after invented but that  Botany  was in great Esteem and Practice appears from the Stories of  Medea Circe  c We often find mention among the most ancient Writers of Women eminent in that Art as of  Agamede  in this very Book ℣ who is said like  Solomon  to have known the Virtues of every Plant  that grew on the Earth and of  Polydamne  in the fourth Book of the  Odysseis  ℣  c  Homer  I believe knew all that was known in his Time of the Practice of these Arts His Methods of extracting of Arrows stanching of Blood by the bitter Root fomenting of Wounds with warm Water applying proper Bandages and Remedies are all according to the true Precepts of Art There are likewise several Passages in his Works that shew his Knowledge of the Virtues of Plants even of those Qualities which are commonly tho 'perhaps erroneously ascribed to them as of the  Moly  against Enchantments the Willow which causes Barrenness the  Nepenthe c  XL  VERSE  But partial  Jove c  The Address of  Homer  in bringing off  Ajax  with Decency is admirable He makes  Hector  afraid to approach him He brings down  Jupiter  himself to terrify him so that he retreats not from a Mortal but a God  This whole Passage is inimitably just and beautiful we see  Ajax  drawn in the most bold and strong Colours and in a manner alive in the Description Wee see him slowly and sullenly retreat between two Armies and even with a Look repulsing the one and protecting the other There is not one Line but what resembles  Ajax  the Character of a stubborn but undaunted Warrior is perfectly maintain'd and must strike the Reader at the first view He compares him first to the Lion for his Undauntedness in Fighting and then to the Ass for his stubborn Slowness in retreating tho' in the latter Comparison there are many other Points of Likeness that enliven the Image The Havock he makes in the Field is represented by the tearing and trampling down the Harvests and we see the Bulk Strength and Obstinacy of the Hero when the  Trojans  in respect to him are compared but to Troops of Boys that impotently endeavour to drive him away  Eustathius  is silent as to those Objections which have been rais'd against this last Simile for a pretended Want of Delicacy  This alone is Conviction to me that they are all of a later Date For else he would not have fail'd to have vindicated his favourite Poet in a Passage that had been applauded many hundreds of Years and stood the Test of Ages  But Monsieur  Dacier  has done it very well in his Remarks upon  Aristotle  "In the time of  Homer  says that Author an Ass was not in such Circumstances of Contempt as in ours The Name of that Animal was not then converted into a Term of Reproach but it was a Beast upon which Kings and Princes might be seen with Dignity And it will not be very discreet to ridicule this Comparison which the holy Scripture has put into the Mouth of  Jacob  who says in the Benediction of his Children Issachar  shall be as a strong Ass  Monsieur  de la Motte  gives up this Point and excuses  Homer  for his Choice of this Animal but is unhappily disgusted at the Circumstance of the Boys and the obstinate Gluttony of the Ass which he says are Images too mean to represent the determin'd Valour of  Ajax  and the Fury of his Enemies It is answer'd by Madam  Dacier  that what  Homer  here images is not the Gluttony but the Patience the Obstinacy and Strength of the Ass as  Eustathius  had before observ'd To judge rightly of Comparisons we are not to examine if the Subject from whence they are deriv'd be great or little noble or familiar but we are principally to consider if the Image produc'd be clear and lively if the Poet has the Skill to dignify it by poetical Words and if it perfectly paints the thing it is intended to represent A Company of Boys whipping a Top is very far from a great and noble Subject yet  Virgil  has not scrupled to draw from it a Similitude which admirably expresses a Princess in the Violence of her Passion  Ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo  Quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum  Intenti ludo exercent ille actus habena  Curvatis fertur spatiis stupet inscia supra  Impubesque manus mirata volubile buxum  Dant animos plagae  c  Aen lib  However upon the whole a Translator owes so much to the Taste of the Age in which he lives as not to make too great a Complement to a former and this induced me to omit the mention of the word  Ass  in the Translation I believe the Reader will pardon me if on this Occasion I transcribe a Passage from Mr  Boileau  's Notes on  Longinus  "There is nothing says he that more disgraces a Composition than the Use of mean and vulgar Words insomuch that generally speaking a mean Thought express'd in noble Terms is more tolerable than a noble Thought express'd in mean ones The Reason whereof is that all the World are not capable to judge of the Justness and Force of a Thought but there's scarce any Man who cannot especially in a living Language perceive the least Meanness of Words Nevertheless very few Writers are free from this Vice  Longinus  accuses  Herodotus  the most polite of all the  Greek  Historians of this Defect and  Livy Salust  and  Virgil  have not escaped the same Censure Is it not then very surprizing that no Reproach on this Account has been ever cast upon  Homer  tho' he has compos'd two Poems each more voluminous than the  Aeneid  and tho' no Author whatever has descended more frequently than he into a Detail of little Particularities Yet he never uses Terms which are not noble or if he uses humble Words or Phrases it is with so much Art and Industry that as  Dionysius  observes they become noble and harmonious Undoubtedly if there had been any Cause to charge him with this Fault  Longinus  had spared him no more than  Herodotus  We may learn from hence the Ignorance of those modern Criticks who resolving to judge of the  Greek  without the Knowledge of it and never reading  Homer  but in low and inelegant Translations impute the Meannesses of his Translators to the Poet himself and ridiculously blame a Man who spoke in one Language for speaking what is not elegant in another They ought to know that the Words of different Languages are not always exactly correspondent and it may often happen that a Word which is very noble in  Greek  cannot be render'd in another Tongue but by one  which is very mean Thus the word  Asinus  in  Latin  and  Ass  in  English  are the vilest imaginable but that which signifies the same Animal in  Greek  and  Hebrew  is of Dignity enough to be employed on the most magnificent Occasions In like manner the Terms of a  Hogherd  and  Cowkeeper  in our Language are insufferable but those which answer to them in  Greek  and  are graceful and harmonious and  Virgil  who in his own Tongue entitled his Eclogs  Bucolica  would have been ashamed to have called them in ours the  Dialogues of Cowkeepers  XLI  VERSE  Back to the Lines the wounded  Greek  retires    We see here almost all the Chiefs of the  Grecian  Army withdrawn  Nestor  and  Ulysses  the two great Counsellors  Agamemnon Diomed  and  Eurypylus  the bravest Warriors all retreated So that now in this Necessity of the  Greeks  there was occasion for the Poet to open a new Scene of Action or else the  Trojans  had been victorious and the  Grecians  driven from the Shores of  Troy  To shew the Distress of the  Greeks  at this Period from which the Poem takes a new Turn 'twill be convenient to cast a View on the Posture of their Affairs All human Aid is cut off by the Wounds of their Heroes and all Assistance from the Gods forbid by  Jupiter  Whereas the  Trojans  see their General at their Head and  Jupiter  himself fights on their side Upon this Hinge turns the whole Poem the Distress of the  Greeks  occasions first the Assistance of  Patroclus  and then the Death of that Hero draws on the Return of  Achilles  It is with great Art that the Poet conducts all these Incidents He lets  Achilles  have the Pleasure of seeing that the  Greeks  were no longer able to carry on the War without his Assistance and upon this depends the great Catastrophe of the Poem  Eustathius  XLII  VERSE  That Hour  Achilles c  Tho' the Resentment of  Achilles  would not permit him to be an Actor in  the Battel yet his Love of War inclines him to be a Spectator And as the Poet did not intend to draw the Character of a perfect Man in  Achilles  he makes him delighted with the Destruction of the  Greeks  because it conspired with his Revenge That Resentment which is the Subject of the Poem still prevails over all his other Passions even the Love of his Country for tho' he begins now to pity his Countrymen yet his Anger stifles those tender Emotions and he seems pleas'd with their Distress because he judges it will contribute to his Glory  Eustathius  XLIII  VERSE  His Friend  Machaon c  It may be ask'd why  Machaon  is the only Person whom  Achilles  pities  Eustathius  answers that it was either because he was his Countryman a  Thessalian  or because  Aesculapius  the Father of  Machaon  presided over Physick the Profession of his Preceptor  Chiron  But perhaps it may be a better Reason to say that a Physician is a publick Good and was valued by the whole Army and it is not improbable but he might have cured  Achilles  of a Wound during the Course of the  Trojan  Wars  XLIV  VERSE  Now at my Knees the  Greeks  shall pour their Moan    The Poet by putting these Words into the Mouth of  Achilles  leaves room for a second Embassy and since  Achilles  himself mentions it one may think it would not have been unsuccessful But the Poet by a more happy Management makes his Friend  Patroclus  the Advocate of the  Greeks  and by that means his Return becomes his own Choice This Conduct admirably maintains the Character of  Achilles  who does not assist the  Greeks  thro' his Kindness to them but from a Desire of Revenge upon the  Trojans  His present Anger for the Death of his Friend blots out the former one for the Injury of  Agamemnon  and as he separated from the Army in a Rage so he joins it again in the like Disposition  Eustathius  XLV  VERSE  And took their Seats beneath the shady Tent    The Poet here steals away the Reader from the Battel and relieves him by the Description of  Nestor  's Entertainment I hope to be pardon'd for having more than once repeated this Observation which extends to several Passages of  Homer  Without this Piece of Conduct the Frequency and Length of his Battels might fatigue the Reader who could not so long be delighted with continued Scenes of Blood  XLVI  VERSE  A Goblet sacred to the  Pylian  Kings    There are some who can find out a Mystery in the plainest things they can see what the Author never meant and explain him into the greatest Obscurities  Eustathius  here gives us a very extraordinary Instance of this Nature The Bowl by an Allegory figures the World the spherical Form of it represents its Roundness the  Greek  word which signifies the  Doves  being spell'd almost like the  Pleiades  is said to mean that Constellation and because the Poet tells us the Bowl was studded with Gold those Studs must needs imply the Stars  XLVII  VERSE  Yet heav'd with ease by him    There has ever been a great Dispute about this Passage nor is it apparent for what Reason the Poet should tell us that  Nestor  even in his old Age could more easily lift this Bowl than any other Man This has drawn a great deal of Raillery upon the old Man as if he had learnt to lift it by frequent Use an Insinuation that  Nestor  was no Enemy to Wine Others with more Justice to his Character have put another Construction upon the Words which solves the Improbability very naturally According to this Opinion the word which is usually supposed to signify  another Man  is render'd  another old Man  meaning  Machaon  whose Wound made him incapable to lift it This would have taken away the Difficulty without any Violence to the Construction But  Eustathius  tells us the Propriety of Speech would require the word to be not  but  when spoken but of two But why then may it not signify any other  old  Men  XLVIII  VERSE  Pours a large Potion    The Potion which  Hecamede  here prepares for  Machaon  has been thought a very extraordinary one in the Case of a wounded Person and by some Criticks held in the same Degree of Repute with the  Balsam of Fierabras  in  Don Quizot  But it is rightly observed by the Commentators that  Machaon  was not so dangerously hurt as to be obliged to a different Regimen from what he might use at another time  Homer  had just told us that he stay'd on the Seaside to refresh himself and he now enters into a long Conversation with  Nestor  neither of which would have been done by a Man in any great Pain or Danger His Loss of Blood and Spirits might make him not so much in fear of a Feaver as in want of a Cordial and accordingly this Potion is rather alimentary than medicinal If it had been directly improper in this Case I cannot help fancying that  Homer  would not have fail'd to tell us of  Machaon  's rejecting it Yet after all some Answer may be made even to the grand Objection that Wine was too inflammatory for a wounded Man  Hippocrates  allows Wine in acute Cases and even without Water in Cases of Indigestion He says indeed in his Book of ancient Medicine that the Ancients were ignorant both of the good and bad Qualities of Wine and yet the Potion here prescrib'd will not be allow'd by Physicians to be an Instance that they were so for Wine might be proper for  Machaon  not only as a Cordial but as an  Opiate Asclepiades  a Physician who flourish'd at  Rome  in the Time of  Pompey  prescribed Wine in Feavers and even in Phrenzies to cause Sleep  Caelius Aurelianus lib    c    XLIX  VERSE  Can then the Sons of  Greece c  It is customary with those who translate or comment on an Author to use him as they do their Mistress they can see no Faults or rather convert his very Faults into Beauties but I cannot be so partial to  Homer  as to imagine that this Speech of  Nestor  's is not greatly blameable for being too long He crouds Incident upon Incident and when he speaks of himself he expatiates upon his own great Actions very naturally indeed to old Age but unseasonably in the present Juncture When he comes to speak of his killing the Son of  Augeas  he is so pleas'd with himself that he forgets the Distress of the Army and cannot leave his favourite Subject till he has given us the Pedigree of his Relations his Wife's Name her Excellence the Command he bore and the Fury with which he assaulted him These and many other Circumstances as they have no visible Allusion to the Design of the Speech seem to be unfortunately introduc'd In short I think they are not so valuable upon any other Account as because they preserve a Piece of ancient History which had otherwise been lost  What tends yet farther to make this Story seem absurd is what  Patroclus  said at the beginning of the Speech that he  had not leisure even to sit down  so that  Nestor  detains him in the Tent standing during the whole Narration  They that are of the contrary Opinion observe that there is a great deal of Art in some Branches of the Discourse that when  Nestor  tells  Patroclus  how he had himself disobey'd his Father's Commands for the sake of his Country he says it to make  Achilles  reflect that he disobeys his Father by the contrary Behaviour That what he did himself was to retaliate a small Injury but  Achilles  by fighting may save the  Grecian  Army He mentions the Wound of  Agamemnon  at the very beginning with an Intent to give  Achilles  a little Revenge and that he may know how much his greatest Enemy has suffer'd by his Absence There are many other Arguments brought in the Defence of particular Parts and it  may not be from the Purpose to observe that  Nestor  might designedly protract the Speech that  Patroclus  might himself behold the Distress of the Army Thus every Moment he detain'd him enforced his Arguments by the growing Misfortunes of the  Greeks  Whether this was the Intention or not it must be allowed that the Stay of  Patroclus  was very happy for the  Greeks  for by this means he met  Eurypylus  wounded who confirm'd him into a Certainty that their Affairs were desperate without  Achilles  's Aid  As for  Nestor  's second Story it is much easier to be defended it tends directly to the Matter in hand and is told in such a manner as to affect both  Patroclus  and  Achilles  the Circumstances are well adapted to the Person to whom they are spoken and by repeating their Father's Instructions he as it were brings them in seconding his Admonitions  L  VERSE  The Bulls of  Elis  in glad Triumph led    Elis  is the whole Southern Part of  Peloponnesus  between  Achaia  and  Messenia  it was originally divided into several Districts or Principalities afterwards it was reduc'd to two the one of the  Elians  who were the same with the  Epeians  the other of  Nestor  This Remark is necessary for the understanding what follows In  Homer  's Time the City  Elis  was not built  Dacier  LI  VERSE  At the publick Course Detain'd his Chariot    'Tis said that these were particular Games which  Augeas  had establish'd in his own State and that the  Olympic  Games cannot be here understood because  Hercules  did not institute them till he had kill'd this King and deliver'd his Kingdom to  Phyleus  whom his Father  Augeas  had banish'd The Prizes of these Games of  Augeas  were Prizes of Wealth as golden Tripods  c  whereas the Prizes of the  Olympic  Games were only plain Chaplets of Leaves or Branches Besides 'tis probable  Homer  knew nothing of these Chaplets given at  the Games nor of the triumphal Crowns nor of the Garlands wore at Feasts if he had he would some where or other have mentioned them  Eustathius  LII  VERSE  The Sons of  Actor  These are the same whom  Homer  calls the two  Molions  namely  Eurytus  and  Cteatus Thryoëssa  in the Lines following is the same Town which he calls  Thryon  in the Catalogue The River  Minyas  is the same with  Anygrus  about half way between  Pylos  and  Thryoëssa  call'd  Minyas  from the  Minyans  who liv'd on the Banks of it It appears from what the Poet says of the Time of their March that it is half a Day's March between  Pylos  and  Thryoëssa Eustathius Strabo lib    LIII  VERSE  There to high  Jove  were publick Thanks assign'd  As first of Gods to  Nestor  of Mankind    There is a Resemblance between this Passage and one in the sacred Scripture where all the Congregation  blessed the Lord God of their Fathers and bowed down their Heads and worshipped the Lord and the King  Chron  LIV  VERSE Peleus  said only this"My Son be brave    The Conciseness of this Advice is very beautiful  Achilles  being hasty active and young might not have burthen'd his Memory with a long Discourse Therefore  Peleus  comprehends all his Instructions in one Sentence But  Menoetius  speaks more largely to  Patroclus  he being more advanc'd in Years and mature in Judgment and we see by the manner of the Expression that he was sent with  Achilles  not only as a Companion but as a Monitor of which  Nestor  puts him in mind to shew that it is rather his Duty to give good Advice to  Achilles  than to follow his Caprice and espouse his Resentment  Eustathius  LV  VERSE  Ah try the utmost  c  It may not be ungrateful to the Reader to see at one view the Aim and Design of  Nestor  's Speech By putting  Patroclus  in mind of his Father's Injunctions he provokes him to obey him by a like Zeal for his Country By the mention of the Sacrifice he reprimands him for a Breach of those Engagements to which the Gods were Witnesses By saying that the very Arms of  Achilles  would restore the Fortunes of  Greece  he makes a high Complement to that Hero and offers a powerful Insinuation to  Patroclus  at the same time by giving him to understand that he may personate  Achilles Eustathius  LVI  VERSE  If ought from Heav'n withhold his saving Arm    Nestor  says this upon account of what  Achilles  himself spoke in the ninth Book and it is very much to the Purpose for nothing could sooner move  Achilles  than to make him think it was the general Report in the Army that he shut himself up in his Tent for no other reason but to escape Death with which his Mother had threaten'd him in discovering to him the Decrees of the Destinies  Dacier  LVII  VERSE  Of two fam'd Surgeons    Tho'  Podalirius  is mention'd first for the sake of the Verse both here and in the Catalogue  Machaon  seems to be the Person of the greatest Character upon many Accounts Besides it is to him that  Homer  attributes the Cure of  Philoctetes  who was lame by having let an Arrow dipt in the Gall of the  Hydra  of  Lerna  fall upon his Foot a plain Mark that  Machaon  was an abler Physician than  Chiron  the Centaure who could not cure himself of such a Wound  Podalirius  had a Son named  Hypolochus  from whom the famous  Hippocrates  was descended  LVIII  VERSE  But this Distress this Instant claims Relief    Eustathius  remarks that  Homer  draws a great Advantage for the Conduct of his Poem from this Incident of the Stay of  Patroclus  for while he is employ'd in the friendly Task of taking Care of  Eurypylus  he becomes an Eyewitness of the Attack upon the Entrenchments and finds the Necessity of using his utmost Efforts to move  Achilles  THE TWELFTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Battel at the  Grecian  Wall  THE  Greeks  being retir'd into their Entrenchments  Hector  attempts to force them but it proving impossible to pass the Ditch  Polydamas  advises to quit their Chariots and manage the Attack on Foot The  Trojans  follow his Counsel and having divided their Army into five Bodies of Foot begin the Assault But upon the Signal of an Eagle with a Serpent in his Talons which appear'd on the left Hand of the  Trojans Polydamas  endeavours to withdraw them again This  Hector  opposes and continues the Attack in which after many Actions  Sarpedon  makes the first Breach in the Wall  Hector  also casting a Stone of a vast Size forces open one of the Gates and enters at the Head of his Troops who victoriously pursue the  Grecians  even to their Ships  THE TWELFTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  WHile thus the Hero's pious Cares attend  The Cure and Safety of his wounded Friend  Trojans  and  Greeks  with clashing Shields engage  And mutual Deaths are dealt with mutual Rage  Nor long the Trench or lofty Walls oppose  With Gods averse th' illfated Works arose  Their Pow'rs neglected and no Victim slain  The Walls were rais'd the Trenches sunk in vain  Without the Gods how short a Period stands  The proudest Monument of mortal Hands  This stood while  Hector  and  Achilles  rag'd  While sacred  Troy  the warring Hosts engag'd  But when her Sons were slain her City burn'd  And what surviv'd of  Greece  to  Greece  return'd  Then  Neptune  and  Apollo  shook the Shore  Then  Ida  's Summits pour'd their wat'ry Store  Rhesus  and  Rhodius  then unite their Rills  Caresus  roaring down the stony Hills  Aesepus Granicus  with mingled Force  And  Zanthus  foaming from his fruitful Source  And gulphy  Simois  rolling to the Main  Helmets and Shields and Godlike Heroes slain  These turn'd by  Phoebus  from their wonted ways  Delug'd the Rampire nine continual Days  The Weight of Waters saps the yielding Wall  And to the Sea the floating Bulwarks fall  Incessant Cataracts the Thund'rer pours  And half the Skies descend in sluicy Show'rs  The God of Ocean marching stern before  With his huge Trident wounds the trembling Shore  Vast Stones and Piles from their Foundation heaves  And whelms the smoaky Ruin in the Waves  Now smooth'd with Sand and levell'd by the Flood  No Fragment tells where once the Wonder stood  In their old Bounds the Rivers roll again  Shine 'twixt the Hills or wander o'er the Plain  But this the Gods in later Times perform  As yet the Bulwark stood and brav'd the Storm  The Strokes yet echo'd of contending Pow'rs  War thunder'd at the Gates and Blood distain'd the Tow'rs  Smote by the Arm of  Jove  with dire Dismay  Close by their hollow Ships the  Grecians  lay  Hector  's Approach in ev'ry Wind they hear  And  Hector  's Fury ev'ry moment fear  He like a Whirlwind toss'd the scatt'ring Throng  Mingled the Troops and drove the Field along  So 'midst the Dogs and Hunter's daring Bands  Fierce of his Might a Boar or Lion stands  Arm'd Foes around a dreadful Circle form  And hissing Javelins rain an Iron Storm  His Pow'rs untam'd their bold Assault defy  And where he turns the Rout disperse or die  He foams he glares he bounds against them all  And if he falls his Courage makes him fall  With equal Rage encompass'd  Hector  glows  Exhorts his Armies and the Trenches shows  The panting Steeds impatient Fury breathe  But snort and tremble at the Gulph beneath  Just on the Brink they neigh and paw the Ground  And the Turf trembles and the Skies resound  Eager they view'd the Prospect dark and deep  Vast was the Leap and headlong hung the Steep  The bottom bare a formidable Show  And bristled thick with sharpen'd Stakes below  The Foot alone this strong Defence could force  And try the Pass impervious to the Horse  This saw  Polydamas  who wisely brave  Restrain'd great  Hector  and this Counsel gave  Oh thou brave Leader of our  Trojan  Bands  And you confed'rate Chiefs from foreign Lands  What Entrance here can cumb'rous Chariots find  The Stakes beneath the  Grecian  Walls behind  No Pass thro' those without a thousand Wounds  No Space for Combat in yon' narrow Bounds  Proud of the Favours mighty  Jove  has shown  On certain Dangers we too rashly run  If 'tis his Will our haughty Foes to tame  Oh may this Instant end the  Grecian  Name  Here far from  Argos  let their Heroes fall  And one great Day destroy and bury all  But should they turn and here oppress our Train  What Hopes what Methods of Retreat remain  Wedg'd in the Trench by our own Troops confus'd  In one promiscuous Carnage crush'd and bruis'd  All  Troy  must perish if their Arms prevail  Nor shall a  Trojan  live to tell the Tale  Hear then ye Warriors and obey with speed  Back from the Trenches let your Steeds be led  Then all alighting wedg'd in firm Array  Proceed on Foot and  Hector  lead the way  So  Greece  shall stoop before our conqu'ring Pow'r  And this if  Jove  consent her fatal Hour  This Counsel pleas'd the Godlike  Hector  sprung  Swift from his Seat his clanging Armour rung  The Chief's Example follow'd by his Train  Each quits his Car and issues on the Plain  By Orders strict the Charioteers enjoin'd  Compell the Coursers to their Ranks behind  The Forces part in five distinguish'd Bands  And all obey their sev'ral Chief's Commands  The best and bravest in the first conspire  Pant for the Fight and threat the Fleet with Fire  Great  Hector  glories in the Van of these  Polydamas  and brave  Cebriones  Before the next the graceful  Paris  shines  And bold  Alcathous  and  Agenor  joins  The Sons of  Priam  with the third appear  Deiphobus  and  Helenus  the Seer  In Arms with these the mighty  Asius  stood  Who drew from  Hyrtacus  his noble Blood  And whom  Arisba  's yellow Coursers bore  The Coursers fed on  Selle  's winding Shore  Antenor  's Sons the fourth Battalion guide  And great  Aeneas  born on fountfull  Ide  Divine  Sarpedon  the last Band obey'd  Whom  Glaucus  and  Asteropaeus  aid  Next him the bravest at their Army's Head  But he more brave than all the Hosts he led  Now with compacted Shields in close Array  The moving Legions speed their headlong way  Already in their Hopes they fire the Fleet  And see the  Grecians  gasping at their Feet  While ev'ry  Trojan  thus and ev'ry Aid  Th'Advice of wise  Polydamas  obey'd  Asius  alone confiding in his Car  His vaunted Coursers urg'd to meet the War  Unhappy Hero and advis'd in vain  Those Wheels returning ne'er shall mark the Plain  No more those Coursers with triumphant Joy  Restore their Master to the Gates of  Troy  Black Death attends behind the  Grecian  Wall  And great  Idomeneus  shall boast thy Fall  Fierce to the left he drives where from the Plain  The flying  Grecians  strove their Ships to gain  Swift thro' the Wall their Horse and Chariots past  The Gates halfopen'd to receive the last  Thither exulting in his Force he flies  His following Host with Clamours rend the Skies  To plunge the  Grecians  headlong in the Main  Such their proud Hopes but all their Hopes were vain  To guard the Gates two mighty Chiefs attend  Who from the  Lapiths  warlike Race descend  This  Polypaetes  great  Perithous'  Heir  And that  Leonteus  like the God of War  As two tall Oaks before the Wall they rise  Their Roots in Earth their Heads amidst the Skies  Whose spreading Arms with leafy Honours crown'd  Forbid the Tempest and protect the Ground  High on the Hills appears their stately Form  And their deep Roots for ever brave the Storm  So graceful these and so the Shock they stand  Of raging  Asius  and his furious Band  Orestes Acamas  in Front appear  And  Oenomaus  and  Thoon  close the Rear  In vain their Clamours shake the ambient Fields  In vain around them beat their hollow Shields  The fearless Brothers on the  Grecians  call  To guard their Navies and defend the Wall  Ev'n when they saw  Troy  's sable Troops impend  And  Greece  tumultuous from her Tow'rs descend  Forth from the Portals rush'd th' intrepid Pair  Oppos'd their Breasts and stood themselves the War  So two wild Boars spring furious from their Den  Rouz'd with the Cries of Dogs and Voice of Men  On ev'ry side the crackling Trees they tear  And root the Shrubs and lay the Forest bare  They gnash their Tusks with Fire their Eyeballs roll  Till some wide Wound lets out their mighty Soul  Around their Heads the whistling Javelins sung  With sounding Strokes their brazen Targets rung  Fierce was the Fight while yet the  Grecian  Pow'rs  Maintain'd the Walls and mann'd the lofty Tow'rs  To save their Fleet the last Efforts they try  And Stones and Darts in mingled Tempests fly  As when sharp  Boreas  blows abroad and brings  The dreary Winter on his frozen Wings  Beneath the lowhung Clouds the Sheets of Snow  Descend and whiten all the Fields below  So fast the Darts on either Army pour  So down the Rampires rolls the rocky Show'r  Heavy and thick resound the batter'd Shields  And the deaf Eccho rattles round the Fields  With Shame repuls'd with Grief and Fury driv'n  The frantic  Asius  thus accuses Heav'n  In Pow'rs immortal who shall now believe  Can those too flatter and can  Jove  deceive  What Man could doubt but  Troy  's victorious Pow'r  Should humble  Greece  and this her fatal Hour  But look how Wasps from hollow Crannies drive  To guard the Entrance of their common Hive  Dark'ning the Rock while with unweary'd Wings  They strike th'Assailants and infix their Stings  A Race determin'd that to Death contend  So fierce these  Greeks  their last Retreats defend  Gods shall two Warriors only guard their Gates  Repell an Army and defraud the Fates  These empty Accents mingled with the Wind  Nor mov'd great  Jove  's unalterable Mind  To Godlike  Hector  and his matchless Might  Was ow'd the Glory of the destin'd Fight  Like Deeds of Arms thro' all the Forts were try'd  And all the Gates sustain'd an equal Tide  Thro' the long Walls the stony Show'rs were heard  The Blaze of Flames the Flash of Arms appear'd  The Spirit of a God my Breast inspire  To raise each Act to Life and sing with Fire  While  Greece  unconquer'd kept alive the War  Secure of Death confiding in Despair  And all her guardian Gods in deep Dismay  With unassisting Arms deplor'd the Day  Ev'n yet the dauntless  Lapithae  maintain  The dreadful Pass and round them heap the slain  First  Damasus  by  Polypoetes'  Steel  Pierc'd thro' his Helmet's brazen Vizor fell  The Weapon drank the mingled Brains and Gore  The Warrior sinks tremendous now no more  Next  Ormenus  and  Pylon  yield their Breath  Nor less  Leonteus  strows the Field with Death  First thro' the Belt  Hippomachus  he goar'd  Then sudden wav'd his unresisted Sword  Antiphates  as thro' the Ranks he broke  The Faulchion strook and Fate pursu'd the Stroke  Iämenus Orestes Menon  bled  And round him rose a Monument of Dead  Meantime the bravest of the the  Trojan  Crew  Bold  Hector  and  Polydamas  pursue  Fierce with Impatience on the Works to fall  And wrap in rowling Flames the Fleet and Wall  These on the farther Bank now stood and gaz'd  By Heav'n alarm'd by Prodigies amaz'd  A signal Omen stopp'd the passing Host  Their martial Fury in their Wonder lost  Jove  's Bird on sounding Pinions beat the Skies  A bleeding Serpent of enormous Size  His Talons truss'd alive and curling round  He stung the Bird whose Throat receiv'd the Wound  Mad with the Smart he drops the fatal Prey  In airy Circles wings his painful way  Floats on the Winds and rends the Heav'ns with Cries  Amidst the Host the fallen Serpent lies  They pale with Terror mark its Spires unroll'd  And  Jove  's Portent with beating Hearts behold  Then first  Polydamas  the Silence broke  Long weigh'd the Signal and to  Hector  spoke  How oft my Brother thy Reproach I bear  For Words well meant and Sentiments sincere  True to those Counsels which I judge the best  I tell the faithful Dictates of my Breast  To speak his Thought is ev'ry Freeman's Right  In Peace and War in Council and in Fight  And all I move deferring to thy Sway  But tends to raise that Pow'r which I obey  Then hear my Words nor may my Words be vain  Seek not this Day the  Grecian  Ships to gain  For sure to warn us  Jove  his Omen sent  And thus my Mind explains its clear Event  The Victor Eagle whose sinister Flight  Retards our Host and fills our Hearts with Fright  Dismiss'd his Conquest in the middle Skies  Allow'd to seize but not possess the Prize  Thus tho' we gird with Fires the  Grecian  Fleet  Tho' these proud Bulwarks tumble at our Feet  Toils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed  More Woes shall follow and more Heroes bleed  So bodes my Soul and bids me thus advise  For thus a skilful Seer would read the Skies  To him then  Hector  with Disdain return'd  Fierce as he spoke his Eyes with Fury burn'd  Are these the faithful Counsels of thy Tongue  Thy Will is partial not thy Reason wrong  Or if the Purpose of thy Heart thou vent  Sure Heav'n resumes the little Sense it lent  What coward Counsels would thy Madness move  Against the Word the Will reveal'd of  Jove  The leading Sign th' irrevocable Nod  And happy Thunders of the fav'ring God  These shall I slight and guide my wav'ring Mind  By wand'ring Birds that flit with ev'ry Wind  Ye Vagrants of the Sky your Wings extend  Or where the Suns arise or where descend  To right to left unheeded take your way  While I the Dictates of high Heav'n obey  Without a Sign his Sword the brave Man draws  And asks no Omen but his Country's Cause  But why should'st thou suspect the War's Success  None fears it more as none promotes it less  Tho' all our Chiefs amid yon' Ships expire  Trust thy own Cowardice to 'scape their Fire  Troy  and her Sons may find a gen'ral Grave  But thou can'st live for thou can'st be a Slave  Yet should the Fears that wary Mind suggests  Spread their cold Poison thro' our Soldier's Breasts  My Javelin can revenge so base a Part  And free the Soul that quivers in thy Heart  Furious he spoke and rushing to the Wall  Calls on his Host his Host obey the Call  With Ardour follow where their Leader flies  Redoubling Clamours thunder in the Skies  Jove  breaths a Whirlwind from the Hills of  Ide  And Drifts of Dust the clouded Navy hide  He fills the  Greeks  with Terror and Dismay  And gives great  Hector  the predestin'd Day  Strong in themselves but stronger in his Aid  Close to the Works their rigid Siege they laid  In vain the Mounds and massy Beams defend  While these they undermine and those they rend  Upheave the Piles that prop the solid Wall  And Heaps on Heaps the smoaky Ruins fall  Greece  on her Ramparts stands the fierce Alarms  The crowded Bulwarks blaze with waving Arms  Shield touching Shield a longrefulgent Row  Whence hissing Darts incessant rain below  The bold  Ajaces  fly from Tow'r to Tow'r  And rouze with Flame divine the  Grecian  Pow'r  The gen'rous Impulse ev'ry  Greek  obeys  Threats urge the fearful and the valiant Praise  Fellows in Arms whose Deeds are known to Fame  And you whose Ardour hopes an equal Name  Since not alike endu'd with Force or Art  Behold a Day when each may act his Part  A Day to fire the brave and warm the cold  To gain new Glories or augment the old  Urge those who stand and those who faint excite  Drown  Hector  's Vaunts in loud Exhorts of Fight  Conquest not Safety fill the Thoughts of all  Seek not your Fleet but sally from the Wall  So  Jove  once more may drive their routed Train  And  Troy  lie trembling in her Walls again  Their Ardour kindles all the  Grecian  Pow'rs  And now the Stones descend in heavier Show'rs  As when high  Jove  his sharp Artill'ry forms  And opes his cloudy Magazine of Storms  In Winter's bleak uncomfortable Reign  A Snowy Inundation hides the Plain  He stills the Winds and bids the Skies to sleep  Then pours the silent Tempest thick and deep  And first the Mountain Tops are cover'd o'er  Then the green Fields and then the sandy Shore  Bent with the Weight the nodding Woods are seen  And one bright Waste hides all the Works of Men  The circling Seas alone absorbing all  Drink the dissolving Fleeces as they fall  So from each side increas'd the stony Rain  And the white Ruin rises o'er the Plain  Thus Godlike  Hector  and his Troops contend  To force the Ramparts and the Gates to rend  Nor  Troy  could conquer nor the  Greeks  would yield  Till great  Sarpedon  tow'r'd amid the Field  For mighty  Jove  inspir'd with martial Flame  His matchless Son and urg'd him on to Fame  In Arms he shines conspicuous from afar  And bears aloft his ample Shield in Air  Within whose Orb the thick BullHides were roll'd  Pond'rous with Brass and bound with ductile Gold  And while two pointed Javelins arm his Hands  Majestick moves along and leads his  Lycian  Bands  So press'd with Hunger from the Mountain's Brow  Descends a Lion on the Flocks below  So stalks the lordly Savage o'er the Plain  In sullen Majesty and stern Disdain  In vain loud Mastives bay him from from afar  And Shepherds gaul him with an Iron War  Regardless furious he pursues his way  He foams he roars he rends the panting Prey  Resolv'd alike divine  Sarpedon  glows  With gen'rous Rage that drives him on the Foes  He views the Tow'rs and meditates their Fall  To sure Destruction dooms th' aspiring Wall  Then casting on his Friend an ardent Look  Fir'd with the Thirst of Glory thus he spoke  Why boast we  Glaucus  our extended Reign  Where  Xanthus'  Streams enrich the  Lycian  Plain  Our num'rous Herds that range the fruitful Field  And Hills where Vines their purple Harvest yield  Our foaming Bowls with purer Nectar crown'd  Our Feasts enhanc'd with Music's sprightly Sound  Why on those Shores are we with Joy survey'd  Admir'd as Heroes and as Gods obey'd  Unless great Acts superior Merit prove  And vindicate the bount'ous Pow'rs above  'Tis ours the Dignity they give to grace  The first in Valour as the first in Place  That when with wond'ring Eyes our martial Bands  Behold our Deeds transcending our Commands  Such they may cry deserve the sov'reign State  Whom those that envy dare not imitate  Could all our Care elude the gloomy Grave  Which claims no less the fearful than the brave  For Lust of Fame I should not vainly dare  In fighting Fields nor urge thy Soul to War  But since alas ignoble Age must come  Disease and Death's inexorable Doom  The Life which others pay let us bestow  And give to Fame what we to Nature owe  Brave tho' we fall and honour'd if we live  Or let us Glory gain or Glory give  He said his Words the list'ning Chief inspire  With equal Warmth and rouze the Warrior's Fire  The Troops pursue their Leaders with Delight  Rush to the Foe and claim the promis'd Fight  Menestheus  from on high the Storm beheld  Threat'ning the Fort and black'ning in the Field  Around the Walls he gaz'd to view from far  What Aid appear'd t'avert th' approaching War  And saw where  Teucer  with th'  Ajaces  stood  Of Fight insatiate prodigal of Blood  In vain he calls the Din of Helms and Shields  Rings to the Skies and ecchos thro' the Fields  The brazen Hinges fly the Walls resound  Heav'n trembles roar the Mountains thunders all the Ground  Then thus to  Thoos  hence with speed he said  And urge the bold  Ajaces  to our Aid  Their Strength united best may help to bear  The bloody Labours of the doubtful War  Hither the  Lycian  Princes bend their Course  The best and bravest of the hostile Force  But if too fiercely there the Foes contend  Let  Telamon  at least our Tow'rs defend  And  Teucer  haste with his unerring Bow  To share the Danger and repell the Foe  Swift as the Word the Herald speeds along  The lofty Ramparts through the martial Throng  And finds the Heroes bath'd in Sweat and Gore  Oppos'd in Combat on the dusty Shore  Ye valiant Leaders of our warlike Bands  Your Aid said  Thoos    Peteus'  Son demands  Your Strength united best may help to bear  The bloody Labours of the doubtful War  Thither the  Lycian  Princes bend their Course  The best and bravest of the hostile Force  But if too fiercely here the Foes contend  At least let  Telamon  those Tow'rs defend  And  Teucer  haste with his unerring Bow  To share the Danger and repell the Foe  Strait to the Fort great  Ajax  turn'd his Care  And thus bespoke his Brothers of the War  Now valiant  Lycomede  exert your Might  And brave  Oïleus  prove your Force in Fight  To you I trust the Fortune of the Field  Till by this Arm the Foe shall be repell'd  That done expect me to compleat the Day  Then with his sev'nfold Shield he strode away  With equal Steps bold  Teucer  press'd the Shore  Whose fatal Bow the strong  Pandion  bore  High on the Walls appear'd the  Lycian  Pow'rs  Like some black Tempest gath'ring round the Tow'rs  The  Greeks  oppress'd their utmost Force unite  Prepar'd to labour in th' unequal Fight  The War renews mix'd Shouts and Groans arise  Tumultuous Clamour mounts and thickens in the Skies  Fierce  Ajax  first th' advancing Host invades  And sends the brave  Epicles  to the Shades  Sarpedon  's Friend Across the Warrior's way  Rent from the Walls a rocky Fragment lay  In modern Ages not the strongest Swain  Could heave th' unwieldy Burthen from the Plain  He poiz'd and swung it round then toss'd on high  It flew with Force and labour'd up the Sky  Full on the  Lycian  's Helmet thund'ring down  The pond'rous Ruin crush'd his batter'd Crown  As skilful Divers from some airy Steep  Headlong descend and shoot into the Deep  So falls  Epicles  then in Groans expires  And murm'ring to the Shades the Soul retires  While to the Ramparts daring  Glaucus  drew  From  Teucer  's Hand a winged Arrow flew  The bearded Shaft the destin'd Passage found  And on his naked Arm inflicts a Wound  The Chief who fear'd some Foe's insulting Boast  Might stop the Progress of his warlike Host  Conceal'd the Wound and leaping from his Height  Retir'd reluctant from th' unfinish'd Fight  Divine  Sarpedon  with Regret beheld  Disabl'd  Glaucus  slowly quit the Field  His beating Breast with gen'rous Ardour glows  He springs to Fight and flies upon the Foes  Alcmäon  first was doom'd his Force to feel  Deep in his Breast he plung'd the pointed Steel  Then from the yawning Wound with Fury tore  The Spear pursu'd by gushing Streams of Gore  Down sinks the Warrior with a thund'ring Sound  His brazen Armour rings against the Ground  Swift to the Battlement the Victor flies  Tugs with full force and ev'ry Nerve applies  It shakes the pond'rous Stones disjointed yield  The rowling Ruins smoak along the Field  A mighty Breach appears the Walls lie bare  And like a Deluge rushes in the War  At once bold  Toucer  draws the twanging Bow  And  Ajax  sends his Javelin at the Foe  Fix'd in his Belt the feather'd Weapon stood  And thro' his Buckler drove the trembling Wood  But  Jove  was present in the dire Debate  To shield his Offspring and avert his Fate  The Prince gave back not meditating Flight  But urging Vengeance and severer Fight  Then rais'd with Hopes and fir'd with Glory's Charms  His fainting Squadrons to new Fury warms  O where ye'  Lycians  is the Strength you boast  Your former Fame and ancient Virtue lost  The Breach lies open but your Chief in vain  Attempts alone the guarded Pass to gain  Unite and soon that hostile Fleet shall fall  The Force of pow'rful Union conquers all  This just Rebuke inflam'd the  Lycian  Crew  They join they thicken and th' Assault renew  Unmov'd th' embody'd  Greeks  their Fury dare  And fix'd support the Weight of all the War  Nor could the  Greeks  repell the  Lycian  Pow'rs  Nor the bold  Lycians  force the  Grecian  Tow'rs  As on the Confines of adjoining Grounds  Two stubborn Swains with Blows dispute their Bounds  They tugg they sweat but neither gain nor yield  One Foot one Inch of the contended Field  Thus obstinate to Death they fight they fall  Nor these can keep nor those can win the Wall  Their manly Breasts are pierc'd with many a Wound  Loud Strokes are heard and ratling Arms resound  The copious Slaughter covers all the Shore  And the high Ramparts drop with human Gore  As when two Scales are charg'd with doubtful Loads  From side to side the trembling Balance nods  While some laborious Matron just and poor  With nice Exactness weighs her woolly Store  Till pois'd aloft the resting Beam suspends  Each equal Weight nor this nor that descends  So stood the War till  Hector  's matchless Might  With Fates prevailing turn'd the Scale of Fight  Fierce as a Whirlwind up the Walls he flies  And fires his Host with loud repeated Cries  Advance ye  Trojans  lend your valiant Hands  Hast to the Fleet and toss the blazing Brands  They hear they run and gath'ring at his Call  Raise scaling Engines and ascend the Wall  Around the Works a Wood of glitt'ring Spears  Shoots up and all the rising Host appears  A pond'rous Stone bold  Hector  heav'd to throw  Pointed above and rough and gross below  Not two strong Men th' enormous Weight could raise  Such Men as live in these degen'rate Days  Yet this as easy as a Swain could bear  The snowy Fleece he toss'd and shook in Air  For  Jove  upheld and lighten'd of its Load  Th' unweildy Rock the Labour of a God  Thus arm'd before the folded Gates he came  Of massy Substance and stupendous Frame  With Iron Bars and Brazen Hinges strong  On lofty Beams of solid Timber hung  Then thund'ring thro' the Planks with forceful Sway  Drives the sharp Rock the solid Beams give way  The Folds are shatter'd from the crackling Door  Leap the resounding Bars the flying Hinges roar  Now rushing in the furious Chief appears  Gloomy as Night and shakes two shining Spears  A dreadful Gleam from his bright Armour came  And from his Eyeballs flash'd the living Flame  He moves a God resistless in his Course  And seems a Match for more than mortal Force  Then pouring after thro' the gaping Space  A Tyde of  Trojans  flows and fills the Place  The  Greeks  behold they tremble and they fly  The Shore is heap'd with Death and Tumult rends the Sky  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Twelfth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TWELFTH BOOK  I  IT may be proper here to take a general View of the Conduct of the Iliad The whole Design turns upon the Wrath of  Achilles  that Wrath is not to be appeas'd but by the Calamities of the  Greeks  who are taught by their frequent Defeats the Importance of this Hero For in Epic as in Tragic Poetry there ought to be some evident and necessary Incident at the winding up of the Catastrophe and that should be founded upon some visible Distress This Conduct has an admirable Effect not only as it gives an Air of Probability to the Relation by allowing Leisure to the Wrath of  Achilles  to cool and die away by degrees who is every where describ'd as a Person of a stubborn Resentment and consequently ought not to be easily reconcil'd but also as it highly contributes to the Honour of  Achilles  which was to be fully satisfy'd before he could relent  II  VERSE  Without the Gods how short a Period  c  Homer  here teaches a Truth conformable to sacred Scripture  and almost in the very Words of the Psalmist  Unless the Lord build the House they labour in vain that build it  III  VERSE  Then  Neptune  and  Apollo c  This whole Episode of the Destruction of the Wall is spoken as a kind of Prophecy where  Homer  in a poetical Enthusiasm relates what was to happen in future Ages It has been conjectur'd from hence that our Author flourish'd not long after the  Trojan  War for had he lived at a greater Distance there had been no occasion to have Recourse to such extraordinary means to destroy a Wall which would have been lost and worn away by Time alone  Homer  says  Aristotle  foresaw the Question might be ask'd how it came to pass that no Ruins remain'd of so great a Work and therefore contrived to give his Fiction the nearest Resemblance to Truth Inundations and Earthquakes are sufficient to abolish the strongest Works of Man so as not to leave the least Remains where they stood But we are told this in a manner wonderfully noble and poetical We see  Apollo  turning the Course of the Rivers against the Wall  Jupiter  opening the Cataracts of Heaven and  Neptune  rending the Foundations with his Trident That is the Sun exhales the Vapours which descend in Rain from the Air or  Aether  this Rain causes an Inundation and that Inundation overturns the Wall Thus the Poetry of  Homer  like Magick first raises a stupendous Object and then immediately causes it to vanish  What farther strengthens the Opinion that  Homer  was particularly careful to avoid the Objection which those of his own Age might raise against the Probability of this Fiction is that the Verses which contain this Account of the Destruction of the Wall seem to be added and interpolated after the first writing of the Iliad by  Homer  himself I believe the Reader will incline to my Opinion if he considers the manner in which they are introduced both here and in the seventh Book where first this Wall is mention'd There describing how it was made he ends with this Line  After which is inserted the Debate of the Gods concerning the Method of its Destruction at the Conclusion whereof immediately follows a Verse that seems exactly to connect with the former  In like manner in the present Book after the fourth Verse  That which is now the thirty sixth seems originally to have follow'd    c  And all the Lines between which break the Course of the Narration and are introduced in a manner not usual in  Homer  seem to have been added for the Reason abovesaid I do not insist much upon this Observation but I doubt not several will agree to it upon a Review of the Passages  IV  VERSE  Nine continual Days    Some of the Ancients thought it incredible that a Wall which was built in one Day by the  Greeks  should resist the joint Efforts of three Deities nine Days To solve this Difficulty  Crates  the  Mallesian  was of Opinion that it should be writ    one day  But there is no occasion to have Recourse to so forc'd a Solution it being sufficient to observe that nothing but such an extraordinary Power could have so entirely ruin'd the Wall that not the least Remains of it should appear but such a one as we have before said  Homer  stood in need of  Eustathius  V  VERSE  The Forces part in five distinguish'd Bands    The  Trojan  Army is divided into five Parts perhaps because there were five Gates in the Wall so that an Attack might be made upon every Gate at the same Instant By this means the  Greeks  would be obliged to disunite and form themselves into as many Bodies to guard five Places at the same time  The Poet here breaks the Thread of his Narration and stops to give us the Names of the Leaders of every Battalion By this Conduct he prepares us for an Action entirely new and different from any other in the Poem  Eustathius  VI  VERSE Asius  alone confiding in his Car    It appears from hence that the three Captains who commanded each Battalion were not subordinate one to the other but commanded separately each being impower'd to order his own Troop as he thought fit For otherwise  Asius  had not been permitted to keep his Chariot when the rest were on Foot One may observe from hence that  Homer  does not attribute the same regular Discipline in War to the barbarous Nations which he had given to his  Grecians  and he makes some use too of this Defect to cast the more Variety over this part of the Description  Dacier  VII  VERSE  Unhappy Hero  c  Homer  observes a poetical Justice in Relation to  Asius  he punishes his Folly and Impiety with Death and shews the Danger of despising wise Counsel and blaspheming the Gods In Pursuance of this Prophecy  Asius  is killed in the thirteenth Book by  Idomeneus  VIII  VERSE  This  Polypoetes  And that  Leonteus c  These Heroes are the Originals of  Pandarus  and  Bitias  in  Virgil  We see two gallant Officers exhorting their Soldiers to act bravely but being deserted by them they execute their own Commands and maintain the Pass against the united Force of the Battalions of  Asius  Nor does the Poet transgress the Bounds of Probability in the Story The  Greeks  from above beat off some of the  Trojans  with Stones and the Gateway being narrow it was easy to be defended  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  The Speech of  Asius  This Speech of  Asius  is very extravagant He exclaims against  Jupiter  for a Breach of Promise not because he had broken his Word but because he had not fulfill'd his own vain Imaginations This Conduct tho' very blameable in  Asius  is very natural to Persons under a Disappointment who are ever ready to blame Heaven and turn their Misfortunes into a Crime  Eustathius  X  VERSE Jove  's Bird on sounding Pinions  c  Virgil  has imitated this Passage in the eleventh  Aeneid  ℣  Utque volans altè raptum cum fulva draconem  Fert aquila implicuitque pedes atque unguibus haesit  Saucius at serpens sinuosa volumina versat  Arrectisque horret squamis sibilat ore  Arduus insurgens illa haud minùs urget obunco  Luctantem rostro simul aethera verberat alis  Which  Macrobius  compares with this of  Homer  and gives the Preference to the Original on account of  Virgil  's having neglected to specify the  Omen His praetermissis quod sinistra veniens vincentium prohibebat accessum accepto à serpente  morsu praedam dolore dejecit factoque Tripudio solistimo cum clamore dolorem testante praetervolat quae animam Parabolae dabant velut exanime in latinis versibus corpus remansit Sat l    c  But methinks this Criticism might have been spared had he consider'd that  Virgil  had no Design or occasion to make an  Omen  of it but took it only as a natural Image to paint the Posture of two Warriors strugling with each other  XI  VERSE  The Speech of  Polydamas  The Address of of  Polydamas  to  Hector  in this Speech is admirable He knew that the daring Spirit of that Hero would not suffer him to listen to any mention of a Retreat He had already storm'd the Walls in Imagination and consequently the Advice of  Polydamas  was sure to meet with a bad Reception He therefore softens every Expression and endeavours to flatter  Hector  into an Assent and tho' he is assured he gives a true Interpretation of the Prodigy he seems to be diffident but that his personated Distrust may not prejudice the Interpretation he concludes with a plain Declaration of his Opinion and tells him that what he delivers is not Conjecture but Science and appeals for the Truth of it to the Augurs of the Army  Eustathius  XII  VERSE  The Speech of  Hector  This Speech of  Hector  's is full of Spirit His Valour is greater than the Skill of  Polydamas  and he is not to be argu'd into a Retreat There is something very heroic in that Line  His Sword the brave Man draws  And asks no Omen but his Country's Cause  And if any thing can add to the Beauty of it it is in being so well adapted to the Character of him who speaks it who is every where describ'd as a great Lover of his Country  It may seem at the first View that  Hector  uses  Polydamas  with too much Severity in the Conclusion of his Speech But he will be sufficiently justify'd if we consider that the Interpretation of the Omen given by  Polydamas  might have discourag'd the Army and this makes it necessary for him to decry the Prediction and insinuate that the Advice proceeded not from his Skill but his Cowardice  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  To right to left unheeded take your way    Eustathius  has found out four Meanings in these two Lines and tells us that the Words may signify East West North and South This is writ in the true Spirit of a Critick who can find out a Mystery in the plainest Words and is ever learnedly obscure For my part I cannot imagine how any thing can be more clearly express'd I care not says  Hector  whether the Eagle flew on the right towards the Sunrising which was propitious or on the left towards his setting which was unlucky  XIV  VERSE Jove  rais'd a Whirlwind    It is worth our Notice to observe how the least Circumstance grows in the Hand of a great Poet In this Battel it is to be supposed that the  Trojans  had got the Advantage of the Wind of the  Grecians  so that a Cloud of Dust was blown upon their Army This gave room for this Fiction of  Homer  which supposes that  Jove  or the Air rais'd the Dust and drove it in the Face of the  Grecians Eustathius  XV  VERSE  Till great  Sarpedon c  The Poet here ushers in  Sarpedon  with Abundance of Pomp He forces him upon the Observation of the Reader by the Greatness of the Description and raises our Expectations of him intending to make him perform many remarkable Actions in the Sequel  of the Poem and become worthy to fall by the Hand of  Patroclus Eustathius  XVI  VERSE  So press'd with Hunger from the Mountain's Brow Descends a Lion    This Comparison very much resembles that of the Prophet  Isaiah  Ch ℣ where God himself is compared to a Lion  Like as the Lion and the young Lion roaring on his Prey when a Multitude of Shepherds is call'd forth against him he will not be afraid of their Voice nor abase himself for the Noise of them So shall the Lord of Hosts come down that he may fight upon Mount  Sion Dacier  XVII  VERSE  The Speech of  Sarpedon  to  Glaucus  In former Times Kings were look'd upon as the Generals of Armies who to return the Honours that were done them were oblig'd to expose themselves first in the Battel and be an Example to their Soldiers Upon this  Sarpedon  grounds his Discourse which is full of Generosity and Nobleness We are says he honour'd like Gods and what can be more unjust than not to behave our selves like Men he ought to be superior in Virtue who is superior in Dignity What Strength is there and what Greatness in that Thought it includes Justice Gratitude and Magnanimity Justice in that he scorns to enjoy what he does not merit Gratitude because he would endeavour to recompense his Obligations to his Subjects and Magnanimity in that he despises Death and thinks of nothing but Glory  Eustathius Dacier  XVIII  VERSE  Could all our Care  c  There is not a more forcible Argument than this to make Men contemn Dangers and seek Glory by brave Actions Immortality  with eternal Youth is certainly preferable to Glory purchas'd with the Loss of Life but Glory is certainly better than an ignominious Life which at last tho' perhaps late must end It is ordain'd that all Men shall die nor can our escaping from Danger secure us Immortality it can only give us a longer Continuance in Disgrace and even that Continuance will be but short tho' the Infamy everlasting This is incontestable and whoever weighs his Actions in these Scales can never hesitate in his Choice But what is most worthy of Remark is that  Homer  does not put this in the Mouth of an ordinary Person but ascribes it to the Son of  Jupiter Eustathius Dacier  XIX  VERSE  Whose fatal Bow the strong  Pandion  bore    It is remarkable that  Teucer  who is excellent for his Skill in Archery does not carry his own Bow but has it born after him by  Pandion  I thought it not improper to take notice of this by reason of its Unusualness It may be suppos'd that  Teucer  had chang'd his Arms in this Fight and comply'd with the Exigence of the Battel which was about the Wall He might judge that some other Weapon might be more necessary upon this Occasion and therefore committed his Bow to the Care of  Pandion Eustathius  XX  VERSE  A Rocky Fragment  c  In this Book both  Ajax  and  Hector  are describ'd throwing Stones of a prodigious Size But the Poet who loves to give the Preference to his Countrymen relates the Action much to the Advantage of  Ajax Ajax  by his natural Strength performs what  Hector  could not do without the Assistance of  Jupiter Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  Not two strong Men    The Difference which our Author makes between the Heroes of his Poem and the  Men of his Age is so great that some have made use of it as an Argument that  Homer  liv'd many Ages after the War of  Troy  But this Argument does not seem to be of any Weight for supposing  Homer  to have writ two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty Years after the Destruction of  Troy  this Space is long enough to make such a Change as he speaks of Peace Luxury or Effeminacy would do it in a much less Time  Dacier  XXII  VERSE  Swift to the Battlement the Victor flies    From what  Sarpedon  here performs we may gather that this Wall of the  Greeks  was not higher than a tall Man From the great Depth and Breadth of it as it is described just before one might have concluded that it had been much higher But it appears to be otherwise from this Passage and consequently the Thickness of the Wall was answerable to the Wideness of the Ditch  Eustathius  XXIII  VERSE  As on the Confines of adjoining Ground    This Simile says  Eustathius  is wonderfully proper it has one Circumstance that is seldom to be found in  Homer  's Allusions it corresponds in every Point with the Subject it was intended to illustrate The Measures of the two Nighbours represent the Spears of the Combatants The Confines of the Fields shews that they engag'd hand to hand and the Wall which divides the Armies gives us a lively Idea of the large Stones that were fix'd to determine the Bounds of adjoining Fields  XXIV  VERSE  As when two Scales  c  This Comparison is excellent on account of its Justness for there is nothing better represents an exact Equality than a Balance But  Homer  was particularly exact in having neither describ'd a Woman of Wealth and Condition for such a one is never very exact  not valuing a small Inequality nor a Slave for such a one is ever regardless of a Master's Interest But he speaks of a poor Woman that gains her Livelihood by her Labour who is at the same time just and honest for she will neither defraud others nor be defrauded her self She therefore takes care that the Scales be exactly of the same Weight  It was an ancient Tradition and is countenanced by the Author of  Homer  's Life ascribed to  Herodotus  that the Poet drew this Comparison from his own Family being himself the Son of a Woman who maintain'd her self by her own Industry He therefore to extol her Honesty a Qualification very rare in Poverty gives her a Place in his Poem  Eustathius  FINIS  blazon
