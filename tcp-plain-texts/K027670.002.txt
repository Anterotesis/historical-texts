 LETTERS OF THE LATE Rev Mr LAURENCE STERNE To his most intimate FRIENDS  WITH A FRAGMENT in the Manner of  Rabelais    To which are prefixed Memoirs of his Life and Family Written by HIMSELF And published by his Daughter Mrs MEDALLE  In THREE VOLUMES  VOL II  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand  LETTERS  LETTER XXVII To Lady D  Paris  July  I Will not send your ladyship the trifles you bid me purchase without a line I am very well pleased with Parisindeed I meet with so many civilities amongst the people here that I must sing their praisesthe French have a great deal of urbanity in their composition and to stay a little  time amongst them will be agreeableI splutter French so as to be understoodbut I have had a droll adventure here in which my Latin was of some service to meI had hired a chaise and a horse to go about seven miles into the country but  Shandean like  did not take notice that the horse was almost dead when I took himBefore I got half way the poor animal dropp'd down deadso I was forced to appear before the Police and began to tell my story in French which was that the poor beast had to do with a worse beast than himself namely  his master  who had driven him all the day before Jehu like and that he had neither had corn or hay  therefore I was not to pay for the horsebut I might as well have whistled as have spoke French and I believe my Latin was equal to my uncle Toby's Lilabulerobeing not understood because of it's purity but by dint of words I forced my judge to do me justiceno common thing by the way in FranceMy wife and daughter are arrivedthe latter does nothing but look out of the window and complain of the torment of being frizledI wish she may ever remain a child of natureI hate children of art  I hope this will find your ladyship welland that you will be kind enough  to direct to me at Toulouse which place I shall set out for very soon I am with truth and sincerity  Your Ladyship's Most faithful L STERNE  LETTER XXVIII To Mr E  Paris  July  Dear Sir  MY wife and daughter arrived here safe and sound on Thursday and are in high raptures with the speed and pleasantness of their journey and particularly of all they see and meet with here But in their journey from York to Paris nothing has given them a more sensible and lasting pleasure than the marks of kindness they received from you and Mrs EThe friendship good will and politeness  of my two friends I never doubted to me or mine and I return you both all a grateful man is capable of which is merely my thanks I have taken however the liberty of sending an Indian taffety which Mrs E must do me the honour to wear for my wife's sake who would have got it made up but that Mr Stanhope the Consul of Algiers who sets off tomorrow morning for London has been so kind I mean his lady as to take charge of it and we had but just time to procure it and had we miss'd that opportunity as we should have been obliged to have left it behind us at Paris we knew not when or how to get it to our friendI  wish it had been better worth a paragraph If there is any thing we can buy or procure for you here intelligence included you have a right to command mefor I am yours with my wife and girl's kind love to you and Mrs E  LAU STERNE  LETTER XXIX To T H S Esq  Toulouse  August  My dear H  BY the time you have got to the end of this long letter you will perceive that I have not been able to answer your last 'till nowI have had the intention of doing it almost as often as my prayers in my head'tis thus we use our best friendswhat an infamous story is that you have told meAfter some little remarks on it the rest of my letter will go on like silk **** is a good natured  old easy fool and has been deceived by the most artful of her sex and she must have abundance of impudence and charlatanery to have carried on such a farce I pity the old man for being taken in for so much moneya man of sense I should have laughed atMy wife saw her when in town and she had not the appearance of poverty but when she wants to melt **** heart she puts her gold watch and diamond rings in her drawerBut he might have been aware of her I could not have been mistaken in her characterand 'tis odd she should talk of her wealth to one and tell another the reverseso good night to herAbout a week  or ten days before my wife arrived at Paris I had the same accident I had at Cambridge of breaking a vessel in my lungs It happen'd in the night and I bled the bed full and finding in the morning I was likely to bleed to death I sent immediately for a surgeon to bleed me at both armsthis saved me and with lying speechless three days I recovered upon my back in bed the breach healed and in a week after I got outThis with my weakness and hurrying about made me think it high time to haste to ToulouseWe have had four months of such heats that the oldest Frenchman never remembers the like'twas as hot as  Nebuchadnezzar  's  oven  and never has relaxed one hourin the height of this 'twas our destiny or rather destruction to set out by way of Lyons Montpellier  c  to shorten I trow our sufferingsGood Godbut tis overand here I am in my own house quite settled by M's aid and goodnatured offices for which I owe him more than I can express or know how to pay at present'Tis in the prettiest situation in Toulouse with near two acres of gardenthe house too good by half for uswell furnished for which I pay thirty pounds a yearI have got a good cookmy wife a decent  femme de chambre  and a good looking  laquais  The Abbé has planned our expences  and set us in such a train we cannot easily go wrongtho' by the bye the D is seldom found sleeping under a hedge Mr Trotter dined with me the day before I left ParisI took care to see all executed according to your directionsbut Trotter I dare say by this has wrote to youI made him happy beyond expression with your crazy tales and more so with its frontispieceI am in spirits writing a crazy chapterwith my face turned towards thy turret'Tis now I wish all warmer climates countries and every thing else at that separates me from our paternal seat  ce sera là où reposera ma cendreet ce sera là où mon cousin viendra repondre  les pleurs dues à notre amitié  I am taking asses milk three times a day and cows milk as oftenI long to see thy face again once moregreet the Col kindly in my name and thank him cordially from me for his many civilities to Madame and Mademoiselle Shandy at York who send all due acknowledgments The humour is over for France and Frenchmen but that is not enough for your affectionate cousin L S  A year will tire us all out I trow but thank heaven the post brings me a letter from my AnthonyI felicitate you upon what Messrs the Reviewers allow youthey have too much judgement  themselves not to allow you what you are actually possess'd of  "talents wit and humour"  Well write on my dear cousin and be guided by thy own fancyOh how I envy you all at Crazy CastleI could like to spend a month with youand should return back again for the vintageI honour the man that has given the world an idea of our parental seat'tis well doneI look at it ten times a day with a  quando te aspiciam  Now farewellremember me to my beloved Colgreet Panty most lovingly on my behalf and if Mrs C and Miss C  c  are at G greet them likewise with a holy kissSo God bless you  LETTER XXX To Mr F at Paris  Toulouse  August  My dear F  AFTER many turnings  alias  digressions to say nothing of downright overthrows stops and delays we have arrived in three weeks at Toulouse and are now settled in our houses with servants c about us and look as composed as if we had been here seven yearsIn our journey we suffered so much from the heats it gives me pain to remember  itI never saw a cloud from Paris to Nismes half as broad as a twentyfour sols pieceGood God we were toasted roasted grill'd stew'd and carbonaded on one side or other all the wayand being all done enough  assez cuits  in the day we were eat up at night by bugs and other unswept out vermin the legal inhabitants if length of possession gives right of every inn we lay atCan you conceive a worse accident than that in such a journey in the hottest day and hour of it four miles from either tree or shrub which could cast a shade of the size of one of Eve's fig leavesthat we should break a hind wheel into  ten thousand pieces and be obliged in consequence to sit five hours on a gravelly road without one drop of water or possibility of getting anyTo mend the matter my two postillions were two doughhearted fools and fell a cryingNothing was to be done By heaven quoth I pulling off my coat and waistcoat something shall be done for I'll thrash you both within an inch of your livesand then make you take each of you a horse and ride like two devils to the next post for a cart to carry my baggage and a wheel to carry ourselvesOur luggage weighed ten quintals'twas the fair of Baucaireall the world was going or returningwe  were ask'd by every soul who pass'd by us if we were going to the fair of BaucaireNo wonder quoth I we have goods enough  vous avez raison mes amis    Well here we are after all my dear friendand most deliciously placed at the extremity of the town in an excellent house well furnish'd and elegant beyond any thing I look'd for'Tis built in the form of a hotel with a pretty court towards the townand behind the best gardens in Toulouse laid out in serpentine walks and so large that the company in our quarter usually come to walk there in the evenings for  which they have my consent  "the more the merrier"  The house consists of a good  salle à manger  above stairs joining to the very great  salle à compagnie  as large as the Baron D'Holbach's three handsome bedchambers with dressing rooms to thembelow stairs two very good rooms for myself one to study in the other to see companyI have moreover cellars round the court and all other officesOf the same landlord I have bargained to have the use of a countryhouse which he has two miles out of town so that myself and all my family have nothing more to do than to take our hats and remove from the one to the otherMy  landlord is moreover to keep the gardens in orderand what do you think I am to pay for all this neither more or less than thirty pounds a yearall things are cheap in proportionso we shall live for very very littleI dined yesterday with Mr H he is most pleasantly situated and they are all wellAs for the books you have received for D the bookseller was a fool not to send the bill along with themI will write to him about itI wish you was with me for two months it would cure you of all evils ghostly and bodilybut this like many other wishes both for you and myself must have its completion elsewhereAdieu my  kind friend and believe that I love you as much from inclination as reason for  I am most truly yours L STERNE  My wife and girl join in compliments to youmy best respects to my worthy Baron d'Holbach and all that societyremember me to my friend Mr Panchaud  LETTER XXXI To J H S Esq  Toulouse  Oct  My dear H  I Received your letter yesterdayso it has been travelling from Crazy Castle to Toulouse full eighteen daysIf I had nothing to stop me I would engage to set out this morning and knock at Crazy Castle gates in three days less timeby which time I should find you and the colonel Panty c all alonethe season I most wish and like to be with you  I rejoice from my heart down to my reins that you have snatch'd so many happy and sunshiny days out of the hands of the blue devilsIf we live to meet and join our forces as heretofore we will give these gentry a drubbingand turn them for ever out of their usurped citadelsome legions of them have been put to flight already by your operations this last campaignand I hope to have a hand in dispersing the remainder the first time my dear cousin sets up his banners again under the square towerBut what art thou meditating with axes and hammers  "  I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart  "  and thou lovest the sweet  visions of architraves friezes and pediments with their tympanums and thou hast found out a pretence  à raison de cinq cent livres sterling  to be laid out in four years c c so as not to be felt which is always added by the D as a bait to justify thyself unto thyselfIt may be very wise to do thisbut 'tis wiser to keep one's money in one's pocket whilst there are wars without and rumours of wars withinSt advises his disciples to sell both coat and waistcoatand go rather without shirt or sword than leave no money in their scrip to go to Jerusalem withNow those  quatre ans consecutifs  my dear Anthony are the most precious  morsels of thy  life to come  in this world and thou wilt do well to enjoy that morsel without cares calculations and curses and damns and debtsfor as sure as stone is stone and mortar is mortar c 'twill be one of the many works of thy repentanceBut after all if the Fates have decreed it as you and I have some time supposed it on account of your generosity  "  that you are never to be a monied man  "  the decree will be fulfilled whether you adorn your castle and line it with cedar and paint it within side and without side with vermilion or not  et cela etant  having a bottle of Frontiniac and glass at my right hand I drink dear  Anthony to thy health and happiness and to the final accomplishments of all thy lunary and sublunary projectsFor six weeks together after I wrote my last letter to you my projects were many stories higher for I was all that time as I thought journeying on to the other worldI fell ill of an epidemic vile fever which killed hundreds about meThe physicians here are the errantest charlatans in Europe or the most ignorant of all pretending foolsI withdrew what was left of me out of their hands and recommended my affairs entirely to Dame NatureShe dear goddess has saved me in fifty different pinching bouts and I begin to have  a kind of enthusiasm now in her favour and in my own That one or two more escapes will make me believe I shall leave you all at last by translation and not by fair death I am now stout and foolish again as a happy man can wish to beand am busy playing the fool with my uncle Toby who I have got soused over head and ears in loveI have many hints and projects for other works all will go on I trust as I wish in this matterWhen I have reaped the benefit of this winter at ToulouseI cannot see I have any thing more to do with it therefore after having gone with my wife and girl to Bagnieres I shall return from  whence I cameNow my wife wants to stay another year to save money and this opposition of wishes tho' it will not be as sour as lemon yet 'twill not be as sweet as sugar candyI wish T would lead Sir Charles to Toulouse 'tis as good as any town in the South of Francefor my own part 'tis not to my tastebut I believe the ground work of my  ennui  is more to the eternal platitude of the French characterslittle variety no originality in it at allthan to any other causefor they are very civilbut civility itself in that uniform wearies and bodders one to deathIf I do not mind I shall grow most stupid and sententious  Miss Shandy is hard at it with musick dancing and French speaking in the last of which she does  à marveille  and speaks it with an excellent accent considering she practices within sight of the Pyrenean MountainsIf the snows will suffer me I propose to spend two or three months at Barege or Bagnieres but my dear wife is against all schemes of additional expenceswhich wicked propensity tho' not of despotick power yet I cannot suffertho' by the bye laudable enoughBut she may talkI will do my own way and she will acquiesce without a word of debate on the subjectWho can say so much in praise of his wife Few  I trowM is out of town vintagingso write to me  Monsieur Sterne gentilhomme Anglois  'twill find meWe are as much out of the road of all intelligence here as at the Cape of Good Hopeso write a long nonsensical letter like this now and then to mein which say nothing but what may be shewn tho' I love every paragraph and spirited stroke of your pen others might not for you must know a letter no sooner arrives from England but curiosity is upon her knees to know the contentsAdieu dear H believe me  Your affectionate L STERNE  We have had bitter cold weather here these fourteen dayswhich has obliged us to sit with whole pagells of wood lighted up to our noses'tis a dear articlebut every thing else being extreme cheap Madame keeps an excellent good house with  soupe boulli roti  c c for two hundred and fifty pounds a year  LETTER XXXII To Mr F at Paris

Toulouse  March  Dear F  THO' that's a mistake I mean the date of the place for I write at Mr H's in the country and have been there with my people all the weekhow does Tristram do you say in yours to himfaith but sosothe worst of human maladies is povertythough that is a second lyefor poverty  of spirit is worse than poverty of purse by ten thousand per centI inclose you a remedy for the one a

safe by last postI was not surprised much with your account of Lord ***** being obliged to give wayand for the rest all follows in courseI suppose you will endeavour to fish and catch something for yourself  in these troubled watersat least I wish you all a reasonable man can wish for himselfwhich is wishing enough for youall the rest is in the brainMr Woodhouse who you know is also herehe is a most amiable worthy man and I have the pleasure of having him much with mein a short time he proceeds to ItalyThe first week in June I decamp like a patriarch with my whole houshold to pitch our tents for three months at the foot of the Pyrenean Hills at Bagnieres where I expect much health and much amusement from the concourse of adventurers from all corners of the earthMrs M sets out at the same time for another part of the  Pyrenean Hills at Coutrayfrom whence to ItalyThis is the general plan of operation hereexcept that I have some thoughts of spending the winter at Florence and crossing over with my family to Leghorn by waterand in April of returning by way of Paris homebut this is a sketch only for in all things I am governed by circumstancesso that what is fit to be done on Monday may be very unwise on SaturdayOn all days of the week believe me yours  With unfeigned truth L STERNE  PS  All compliments to my Parisian friends  LETTER XXXVII To the same  Toulouse  April  My dear F  LAST post my agent wrote me word he would send up from York a bill for fourscore guineas with orders to be paid into Mr Selwin's hands for me This he said he would expedite immediately so 'tis possible you may have had advice of itand 'tis possible also the money may not be paid this fortnight therefore as I  set out for Bagnieres in that time be so good as to give me credit for the money for a few posts or so and send me either a rescription for the money or a draught for itat the receipt of which we shall decamp for ten or twelve weeksYou will receive twenty pounds more on my account which send alsoSo much for thatas for pleasureyou have it all amongst you at Pariswe have nothing here which deserves the nameI shall scarce be tempted to sojourn another winter at Toulousefor I cannot say it suits my health as I hoped'tis too moistand I cannot keep clear of agues hereso that if I stay the next winter on  this side of the water'twill be either at Nice or Florenceand I shall return to England in AprilWherever I am believe me dear F that I am  Yours faithfully L STERNE  Madame and Mademoiselle present their best complimentsRemember me to all I regard particularly Messrs Pd and the rest of your  houshold    LETTER XXXVIII To the same  Toulouse  May  Dear Sir  I Took the liberty three weeks ago to desire you would be so kind as to send me fourscore pounds having received a letter the same post from my Agent that he would order the money to be paid to your correspondent in London in a fortnightIt is some disappointment to me that you have taken no notice of my letter especially as I told you we waited for the money  before we set out for Bagnieresand so little distrust had I that such a civility would be refused me that we have actually had all our things pack'd up these eight days in hourly expectation of receiving a letterPerhaps my good friend has waited till he heard the money was paid in Londonbut you might have trusted to my honourthat all the cash in your iron box and all the bankers in Europe put together could not have tempted me to say the thing  that is not  I hope before this you will have received an account of the money being paid in LondonBut it would have been taken kindly if you had wrote me word you would  transmit me the money when you had received it but no sooner for Mr R of Montpellier tho' I know him not yet knows enough of me to have given me credit for a fortnight for ten times the sum  I am dear F your friend and hearty wellwisher L STERNE  I saw the family of the H yesterday and asked them if you was in the land of the livingThey said yeafor they had just received a letter from youAfter all I heartily forgive youfor you have done me a signal service in mortifying me  and it is this I am determined to grow rich upon it  Adieu and God send you wealth and happinessAll compliments to Before April next I am obliged to revisit your metropolis in my way to England  LETTER XXXIX To the same  Toulouse  June  My dear F  I This moment received yoursconsequently the moment I got it I sat down to answer itSo much for a logical inference  Now believe me I had never wrote you so testy a letter had I not both loved and esteemed youand it was merely in vindication of the rights of friendship that I wrote in a way as  if I was hurtfor neglect me in your heart I knew you could not without cause which my heart told me I never hador will ever give youI was the best friends with you that ever I was in my life before my letter had got a league and pleaded the true excuse for my friend  "That he was oppressed with a multitude of business"  Go on my dear F and have but that excuse so much do I regard your interest that I would be content to suffer a  real evil  without future murmuringbut in truth my disappointment was partly chimerical at the bottom having a letter of credit for two hundred pounds from a person I never saw by mebut  which out of a nicety of temper I would not make any use ofI set out in two days for Bagnieres but direct to me to Brousse who will forward all my lettersDear F adieuBelieve me  Yours affectionately L STERNE  LETTER XL To the same  Toulouse  June  Dear F  LUCKILY just before I was stepping into my chaise for Bagnieres has a strayed fifty pound bill found its way to me so I have sent it to its lawful owner inclosedMy noodle of an agent instead of getting Mr Selwin to advise you he had received the money which would have been enough has got a bill for it and sent it rambling to the furthest part  of France after me and if it had not caught me just now it might have followed me into Spain for I shall cross the Pyreneans and spend a week in that kingdom which is enough for a fertile brain to write a volume uponWhen I write the history of my travelsMemorandum I am not to forget how honest a man I have for a banker at ParisBut my dear friend when you say you dare trust me for what little occasions I may have you have as much faith as honestyand more of both than of good policyI thank you however ten thousand timesand except such liberty as I have lately taken with youand that too at a pinchI say  beyond that I will not trespass upon your good nature or friendliness to serve meGod bless you dear F  I am yours whilst L STERNE  LETTER XLI To the same  Montpellier  Oct  Dear F  I Am ashamed I have not taken an opportunity of thanking you before now for your friendly act of civility in ordering Brousse your correspondent at Toulouse in case I should have occasion to pay me fifteen hundred livreswhich as I knew the offer came from your heart I made no difficulty of acceptingIn my way thro' Toulouse to Marseilles where  we have been but neither liking the place nor Aix particularly the latter it being a parliament town of which Toulouse has given me a surfeit we have returned here where we shall reside the winterMy wife and daughter purpose to stay a year at least behind meand when winter is over to return to Toulouse or go to Montaubon where they will stay till they return or I fetch themFor myself I shall set out in February for England where my heart has been fled these six monthsbut I shall stay a fortnight with my friends at Paris tho' I verily believe if it was not for the pleasure of seeing and chattering with you I should pass on directly  to Brussels and so on to Rotterdam for the sake of seeing Holland and embark from thence to LondonBut I must stay a little with those I love and have so many reasons to regardyou cannot place too much of this to your own scoreI have had an offer of going to Italy a fortnight agobut I must like my subject as well as the terms neither of which were to my mindPray what English have you at Paris where is my young friend Mr F We hear of three or four English families coming to us hereIf I can be serviceable to any you would serve you have but to writeMr H has sent my friend W's pictureYou have seen the  original or I would have sent it youI believe I shall beg leave to get a copy of my own from yours when I come in  propria persona  till when God bless you my dear friend and believe me  Most faithfully yours L STERNE  LETTER XLII To the same  Montpellier  Jan  My dear Friend  YOU see I cannot pass over the fifth of the month without thinking of you and writing to youThe last is a periodical habitthe first is from my heart and I do it oftner than I rememberhowever from both motives together I maintain I have a right to the pleasure of a single linebe it only to tell me how your watch goesYou know how much happier  it would make me to know that all things belonging to you went on wellYou are going to have them all to yourself I hear and that Mr S is true to his first intention of leaving businessI hope this will enable you to accomplish yours in a shorter time that you may get to your long wished for retreat of tranquillity and silenceWhen you have got to your fireside and into your armchair and by the by have another to spare for a friend and are so much a sovereign as to sit in your furr'd cap if you like it tho' I should not for a man's ideas are at least the cleaner for being dress'd decently why then it will be a miracle if I do not glide in like a  ghost upon youand in a very unghostlike fashion help you off with a bottle of your best wine  January It does not happen every day that a letter begun in the most perfect health should be concluded in the greatest weaknessI wish the vulgar high and low do not say it was a judgement upon me for taking all this liberty with  ghosts  Be it as it mayI took a ride when the first part of this was wrote towards Perenasand returned home in a shivering fit tho' I ought to have been in a fever for I had tired my beast and he was as unmoveable as Don Quixote's wooden horse and my  arm was half dislocated in whipping himThis quoth I is inhumanNo says a peasant on foot behind me I'll drive him homeso he laid on his posteriors but 'twas needlessas his face was turn'd towards Montpellier he began to trotBut to return this fever has confined me ten days in my bedI have suffered in this scuffle with death terriblybut unless the spirit of prophecy deceive meI shall not die but livein the mean time dear F let us live as merrily but  as innocently  as we canIt has ever been as good if not better than a bishoprick to meand  I desire no other  Adieu my dear friend and believe me yours  L S  Please to give the inclosed to Mr Tand tell him I thank him cordially from my heart for his great  goodwill    LETTER XLIII To the same  Montpellier  Jan  My dear Friend  HEARING by Lord R who in passing thro' here in his way to Madrid has given me a call that my worthy friend Mr Fox was now at ParisI have inclosed a letter to him which you will present in course or direct to himI suppose you are full of Englishbut in short we are here as if in another world where unless some stray'd soul arrives we know nothing  of what is going on in yoursLord Gr I suppose is gone from Paris or I had wrote also to him I know you are as busy as a bee and have few moments to yourselfnevertheless bestow one of them upon an old friend and write me a lineand if Mr F is too idle and has ought to say to me pray write a second line for himWe had a letter from Miss P this week who it seems has decamp'd for ever from Paris  All is for the best  which is my general reflection upon many things in this worldWell I shall shortly come and shake you by the hand in St Sauveurif still you are thereMy wife returns to Toulouse and purposes to  spend the summer at BagnieresI on the contrary go and visit my wife the church in YorkshireWe all live the longerat least the happierfor having things our own wayThis is my conjugal maximI own 'tis not the best of maximsbut I maintain 'tis not the worst Adieu dear F and believe me  Yours with truth L STERNE  LETTER XLIV To Mrs F  Montpellier  Feb  I AM preparing my dear Mrs F to leave France for I am heartily tired of itThat insipidity there is in French characters has disgusted your friend YorickI have been dangerously ill and cannot think that the sharp air of Montpellier has been of service to meand so my physicians told me when they had me under their hands for above a monthif you stay any longer here Sir it  will be fatal to youAnd why good people were you not kind enough to tell me this soonerAfter having discharged them I told Mrs S that I should set out for England very soon but as she chuses to remain in France for two or three years I have no objection except that I wish my girl in EnglandThe states of Languedoc are met'tis a fine rareeshew with the usual accompanyments of fiddles bears and puppetshewsI believe I shall step into my postchaise with more alacrity to fly from these sights than a Frenchman would to fly to themand except a tear at parting with my little slut I shall be in high spirits and every step I take  that brings me nearer England will I think help to set this poor frame to rights Now pray write to me directed to Mr F at Paris and tell me what I am to bring you overHow do I long to greet all my friends few do I value more than yourselfMy wife chuses to go to Montauban rather than stay here in which I am truely passiveIf this should not find you at Bath I hope it will be forwarded to you as I wish to fulfill your commissionsand so adieuAccept every warm

going to leave a few poor sheep here in the wilderness for fourteen daysand from pride and naughtiness of heart to go see what is doing at Scarboroughstedfastly meaning afterwards to lead a new life

the acknowledgments of your attention and kind services to her I will not believe these arose from the D of A's letters nor mine Surely  she needed no  recommendationthe truest and most honest compliment I can pay you is to say they came from your own good heart only you was introduced  to the objectfor the rest follow'd in courseHowever let me cast in my mite of thanks to the treasury which belongs to good natured actions I have been with Lord Gy these three weeks at Scarboroughthe pleasures of which I found somewhat more exalted than those of Bagnieres last yearI am now returned to my Philosophical Hut to finish Tristram which I calculate will be ready for the world about Christmas at which time I decamp from hence and fix my head quarters at London for the winterunless my

week a letter from Mrs S from Montauban in which she tells me she has occasion for fifty pounds immediatelyWill you send an order to your correspondent at Montauban to pay her so much cashand I will in three weeks send as much to BecketBut as her purse is low for God's sake write directlyNow you must do something equally essentialto rectify a mistake in the mind of your correspondent there who it seems gave her a hint not long ago  "  that she was separated  from me for life  Now as this is not true in the first place and may give a disadvantageous impression of her to those she lives amongst'twould be unmerciful to let her or my daughter suffer by it so do be so good as to undeceive himfor in a year or two she proposes and indeed I expect it with impatience from her to rejoin meand tell them I have all the confidence in the world she will not spend more than I can afford and I only mention'd two hundred guineas a yearbecause 'twas right to name some certain sum for which I beg'd you to give her creditI write to you of all my most intimate concerns as to a brother  so excuse me dear F God bless youBelieve me  Yours affectionately L STERNE  Compliments to Mr Panchaud

would write to Mademoiselle  N to make as good a copy from it as she possibly couldwith a view to do her service hereand I would remit her the priceI really believe it would be the parent of a dozen portraits to her if she executes it with the spirit of the original in your handsfor it will be seen by manyand as my phiz is as remarkable as myself if she preserves the true character of both it will do her honour and service tooWrite me a line about this and tell me you are well and happyWill you present my kind respects to the worthy BaronI shall send him one of the best impressions of my

receiv'd a letter from C who has been very ill and is coming down to stay a week or ten  days with meNow I know he is ambitious of being better acquainted with you and longs from his soul for a sight of you in your own castleI cannot do otherwise than bring him with menor can I gallop away and leave him an empty house to pay a visit to from London as he comes half express to see meI thank you for the care of my northern vintageI fear after all I must give it a fermentation on the other side of the Alps which is better than being on the lees with itbut  nous verrons  yet I fear as it has got such hold of my brain and comes upon it like an armed man at nightsI must give way for quietness sake or be hagridden with  the conceit of it all my life longI have been  Missridden  this last week by a couple of romping girls  bien mises et comme il faut  who might as well have been in the house with me tho' perhaps not my retreat here is too quiet for them but they have taken up all my time and have given my judgment and fancy more airings than they wantedThese things accord not well with sermon makingbut 'tis my vile errantry as Sancho says and that is all that can be made of itI trust all goes swimmingly on with your alum that the works amuse you and call you twice out at least a dayI shall see them I trust in ten days or thereaboutIf  it was any way possible I would set out this

LII To Mr F at P  York  November  My dear Friend  THREE posts before I had the favour of yours which is come to hand this moment I had wrote to set Mrs S right in her mistakeThat you had any money of mine in your handsbeing very sensible that the hundred pounds I had sent you thro' Becket's hands was but about what would balance with youThe reason of her error was owing to my writing her word I would send you a  bill in a post or two for fifty poundswhich my finances falling short just then I deferr'dso that I had paid nothing to any onebut was however come to York this day and I have sent you a draught for a hundred poundsin honest truth a fortnight ago I had not the cashbut I am as honest as the king as Sancho Pança says  only not so rich    Therefore if Mrs S should want thirty louis more let her have themand I will balance all which will not be much with honour at Christmas when I shall be in London having now just finish'd my two volumes of TristramI have some thoughts of  going to Italy this yearat least I shall not defer it above anotherI have been with Lord Granby and with Lord Shelburne but am now sat down till December in my sweet retirementI wish you was sat down as happily and as free of all worldly caresIn a few years my dear F I hope to see you a real country gentleman tho' not altogether exiled from your friends in Londonthere I shall spend every winter of my life in the same lap of contentment where I enjoy myself nowand wherever I gowe must bring three parts in four of the treat along with usIn short we must be happy withinand then few things  without us make much differenceThis is my Shandean philosophyYou will read a comic account of my journey from Calais thro' Paris to the Garonne in these volumesmy friends tell me they are done with spiritit must

London  March  Dear G  I Threatened you with a letter in one I wrote a few weeks ago to Foley but to my shame be it spoken I lead such a life of dissipation I have never had a moment to myself which has not been broke in upon by one engagement or impertinence or anotherand as plots thicken towards the latter end of a piece I find unless I take pen and ink just now I shall not be able to do it  till either I am got into the country or you to the city You are teized and tormented too much by your correspondents to return to us and with accounts how much your friends and how much your Theatre wants youso that I will not magnify either our loss or yoursbut hope cordially to see you soonSince I wrote last I have frequently stept into your housethat is as frequently as I could take the whole party where I dined along with meThis was but justice to you as I walk'd in as a witbut with regard to myself I balanced the account thusI am sometimes in my friend 's house but he is always in Tristram Shandy'swhere my  friends say he will continue and I hope the prophecy true for my own immortality even when he himself is no more  I have had a lucrative winter's campaign hereShandy sells wellI am taxing the publick with two more volumes of sermons which will more than double the gains of ShandyIt goes into the world with a prancing list of  de toute la noblesse  which will bring me in three hundred pounds exclusive of the sale of the copyso that with all the contempt of money which  ma façon de penser  has ever impress'd on me I shall be rich in spite of myself but I scorn you  must know in the high  ton  I take at present to pocket all this trashI set out to lay a portion of it in the service of the world in a tour round Italy where I shall spring game or the duce is in the diceIn the beginning of September I quit England that I may avail myself of the time of vintage when all nature is joyous and so saunter philosophically for a year or so on the other side the AlpsI hope your pilgrimages have brought Mrs G and yourself back  à la fleur de jeunesse  May you both long feel the sweets of it and your friends with youDo dear friend make my kindest wishes and

my dear friendfoul befal the man who hurts a hair of your headand so full was I of that very sentiment that my letter had not been put into the postoffice ten minutes before my heart smote me and I sent to recall itbut failedYou are sadly to blame Shandy for this quoth I leaning with my head on my hand as I recriminated upon my false delicacy in  the affairG's nerves if he has any left are as fine and delicately spun as thy ownhis sentiments as honest and friendlythou knowest Shandy that he loves theewhy wilt thou hazard him a moment's pain Puppy fool coxcomb jackass c cand so I balanced the account to your favour before I received it drawn up in  your way  I say  your way  for it is not stated so much to your honour and credit as I had passed the account beforefor it was a most lamented truth that I never received one of the letters your friendship meant me except whilst in ParisO how I congratulate you for the anxiety the world has and continues  to be under for your returnReturn return to the few who love you and the thousands who admire youThe moment you set your foot upon your stagemark I tell it youby some magic irresisted power every fibre about your heart

othersAs so many men of genius favour me with their names also I will quarrel with Mr He and call him deist and what not unless I have his name tooMy love to Lord WYour name F I have put in as a

STERNE  LETTER LVI To Mr W  Coxwould  May  AT this moment am I sitting in my summer house with my head and heart full not of my uncle Toby's amours with the widow Wadman but my sermonsand your letter has drawn me out of a pensive moodthe spirit of it  pleaseth me  but in this solitude what can I tell or write to you but about myselfI am glad that you are in love'twill cure you at least of the spleen which has a bad  effect on both man and womanI myself must ever have some dulcinea in my headit harmonises the souland in those cases I first endeavour to make the lady believe so or rather I begin first to make myself believe that I am in lovebut I carry on my affairs quite in the French way sentimentally  "  l'amour  " say they "  n'est rien sans sentiment  "  Now notwithstanding they make such a pother about the  word  they have no precise idea annex'd to itAnd so much for that same subject called loveI must tell you how I have just treated a French gentleman of fortune in France who took a liking to my daughterWithout any ceremony  having got my direction from my wife's banker he wrote me word that he was in love with my daughter and desired to know what  fortune  I would give her at present and how much at my  death  by the bye I think there was very little  sentiment  on  his side  My answer was  "Sir I shall give her ten thousand pounds the day of marriagemy calculation is as followsshe is not eighteen you are sixtytwothere goes five thousand poundsthen Sir you at least think her not uglyshe has many accomplishments speaks Italian French plays upon the guittar and as I fear you play upon no instrument whatever I think you  will be happy to take her at my terms for here finishes the account of the ten thousand pounds"  I do not suppose but he will take this as I mean that isa flat refusalI have had a parsonage house burnt down by the carelessness of my curate's wifeas soon as I can I must rebuild it I trowbut I lack the means at presentyet I am never happier than when I have not a shilling in my pocketfor when I have I can never call it my own Adieu my dear friendmay you enjoy better health than me tho' not better spirits for that is impossible  Yours sincerely L STERNE  My compliments to the Col  LETTER LVII To Mr F at Paris  York  July  My dear Sir  I Wrote some time in spring to beg you would favour me with my account I believe you was set out from Paris and that Mr Garrick brought the letter with himwhich possibly he gave you In the hurry of your business you might forget the contents of it and in the hurry of mine in town though I called once I could not get to see you I decamp for  Italy in September and shall see your face at Paris you may be surebut I shall see it with more pleasure when I am out of debtwhich is your own fault for Becket has had money left in his hands for that purposeDo send Mrs Sterne her two last volumes of Tristram they arrived with your's in spring and she complains she has not got themMy best services to Mr PanchaudI am busy composing two volumes of sermonsthey will be printed in September though I fear not time enough to bring them with me Your name is amongst the list of a few of my honorary subscriberswho subscribe for loveIf you see Baron D'Holbach  and Diderot present my respects to themIf the Baron wants any English books he will let me know and I will bring them with meAdieu  I am truly your's L STERNE  LETTER LVIII To Mrs Mds  Coxwould  July  THE first time I have dipped my pen into the inkhorn for this week past is to write to you and to thank you most sincerely for your kind epistleWill this be a sufficient apology for my letting it be ten days upon my table without answering itI trust it willI am sure my own feelings tell me so because I felt it impossible to do any thing that is ungracious towards youIt is not every  hour or day or week of a man's life that is a fit season for the duties of friendshipsentiment is not always at handpride and folly and what is called business oftentimes keep it at a distanceand without sentiment what is friendshipa name a shadowBut to prevent a misapplication of this though why should I fear it from so kind and gentle a spirit as your'syou must know that by carelessness of my curate or his wife or his maid or some one within his gates the parsonagehouse at Sutton was burnt to the ground with the furniture that belonged to me and a pretty good collection of books the loss three hundred and fifty pounds  The poor man with his wife took the wings of the next morning and fled awaythis has given me real vexation for so much was my pity and esteem for him that as soon as I heard of this disaster I sent to desire he would come and take up his abode with me till another habitation was ready to receive himbut he was goneand as I am told through fear of my persecutionHeavens how little did he know of me to suppose I was among the number of those wretches that heap misfortune upon misfortuneand when the load is almost insupportable still to add to the weight God who reads my heart knows it to be truethat I wish rather to share  than to encrease the burthen of the miserableto dry up instead of adding a single drop to the stream of sorrowAs for the dirty trash of this world I regard it notthe loss of it does not cost me a sigh for after all I may say with the Spanish Captain that I am as good a gentleman as the king only not quite so rich  But to the point Shall I expect you here this summerI much wish that you may make it convenient to gratify me in a visit for a few weeksI will give you a roast fowl for your dinner and a clean tablecloth every dayand tell you a story by way of desertin the heat of the day we will  sit in the shadeand in the evening the fairest of all the milkmaids who pass by my gate shall weave a garland for youIf I should not be so fortunate contrive to meet me the beginning of OctoberI shall stay a fortnight after and then seek a kindlier climateThis plaguy cough of mine seems to gain ground and will bring me to my grave in spight of mebut while I have strength to run away from it I willI have been wrestling with it for these twenty years pastand what with laughter and good spirits have prevented its giving me a fallbut my antagonist presses closer than ever upon meand I have nothing left on my side but another  journey

go to Naples and see whether  the air of that place will not set this poor frame to rightsAs to the project of getting a bear to lead I think I have enough to do to govern myselfand however profitable

upand thought no more about it  But there is more goes to the healing of a wound than this comes toa wound unless 'tis a wound not worth talking of but by the bye mine is must give you some pain afterNature will take her own way with itit must fermentit must digest  The story you told me of Tristram's pretended tutor this morningMy letter by right should have set out with this sentence and then the simile would not have kept you a moment in suspence  This vile story I saytho' I then saw both how and where it woundedI felt little from it at firstor to speak more honestly tho' it ruins my simile I felt a great deal of pain from it but affected an air usual on such accidents of less feeling than I had  I have now got home to my lodgings since the play you astonished me in it and have been unwrapping this selfsame wound of mine and shaking my head over it this half hour  What the devilis there no one learned blockhead throughout the many schools of misapplied science in the Christian World to make a  tutor  of for my Tristram  Ex quovis ligno non fit  Are we so run out of stock that there is no one lumberheaded muddleheaded mortarheaded puddingheaded  chap  amongst our doctorsIs there no one single wight of much reading and no learning amongst the many children in my  mother's  nursery who bid high for this chargebut I must disable my judgment by choosing a Wn

all the immortality I intended him O dear Mr G  Malice is ingeniousunless where the excess of it outwits itselfI have two comforts in this stroke of itthe first is that this one is partly of this kind and secondly that it is one of the number of those which so unfairly brought poor Yorick to his graveThe report might draw blood of the author of Tristram Shandybut could not harm such a man as the author of the Divine LegationGod bless him though by the bye and according to the natural course of descents the blessing should come from him to me  Pray have you no interest lateral or collateral to get me introduced to his Lordship  Why do you ask  My dear Sir I have no claim to such an honour but what arises from the honour and respect which in the progress of my work will be shewn the world I owe to so great a man  Whilst I am talking of owingI wish my dear Sir that any body would tell you how much I am indebted to youI am determined never to do it myself or say more upon the subject than this that I am yours  L STERNE  End of Vol II
