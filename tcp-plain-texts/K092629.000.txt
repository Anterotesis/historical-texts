of Knowledge to whom the various Parts of Learning will be more justly adapted  As then every Part of the COMMONPRAYER speaks the Breathings of the greatest of Saints the earliest Antiquity and the soundest Faith so a Treatise on any Part of it will be most suitably patronized by a Lover of our Church and a Practiser of her Doctrines by one skill'd in her Offices and unshaken in her Faith I hope therefore you'll excuse the Freedom of a Dedication since the Nature of this Performance calls for your Protection of it  Or whether you are considered as sprung from a  Great Ornament  of our Church From one learned in Antiquity truly Orthodox primitive in his Example and holy in his Life Or whether as you are allied to that  Noble Family  which gives Examples to the World of the earliest Virtue and a lasting Piety of Veneration for the Church and Esteem for her Clergy of such as rejoyce in doing  Good Works  to the one and Deeds of  Hospitality  to the other your Right to this Treatise is not a little strengthned  But when together with these I reflect on your placing me in your Friendship and Familiarity and the many kind and affectionate Offices you have done me you'll easily pardon my Choice as it affords me so just a Patron and gives me an Opportunity of somewhat acknowledging your many Favours to  SIR  Your most obliged and Most humble Servant  HENRY BOURNE  THE PREFACE  _THE Design of the following Pages is to shew the Relation the  COLLECTS EPISTLES  and  GOSPELS  from the first Sunday in  Advent  till  TrinitySunday  have to their Respective Times and Seasons and what Connection and Agreement every  COLLECT EPISTLE  and  GOSPEL  for the Sundays after  Trinity  till  Advent  have among themselves And this I hope may be of some Service not only as it is exceedingly delightful to the Mind to consider the Order and Fitness and Harmony of these Offices but as it will make them have that Esteem and Regard paid them they justly deserve as it will speak clearly the Wisdom of the Church in so compiling them as it will instruct in a  due Knowledge of Times and Seasons and make them be a more  Reasonable Service  than they usually are with the most of People  Bishop  Sparrow  and Mr  Wheatley  in their excellent Treatises of the  CommonPrayer  have both of them treated of this in the Sundays before  Trinity  But then what they have wrote on this Subject is lodged in a Book which is not easily got by those who will reap the greatest Benefit from a Work of this Nature I have therefore considered in as narrow a Compass as I conveniently could both the  Offices  before and after  Trinity  in the Manner above mentioned And this I have done not only from such Hints and Passages of the Moderns particularly the two great Men abovementioned as give any but also from the ancient  RITUALISTS  I hope it will be no Fault that it comes after so many much more valuable and learned Treatises on the  CommonPrayer  as it aims at nothing more than the Instruction of the Ignorant in this Part of it which as far as I know has not hitherto been so published as to be of Service to them  Of  ADVENT  _THE Word  Advent  signifies  Coming  and is appropriated to the Time preceeding  Christmass  Hug a San Vict Lib    c    to commemorate that Time in which the Messiah was so much expected and also to prepare us for his Coming in the Flesh For this Season is to  ChristmassDay  what  John  the  Baptist  was to our Lord  a Forerunner and Preparer of the Way  It is observable that the Church in celebrating the most remarkable Histories of our Saviour's Life and Death hath followed the Order they were done in and plac'd them answerable to their respective Times Thus she commemorates his Nativity before his Death and his Death before his Resurrection and Ascension And this is the Reason why the Office of our Lord's Advent precedes the other Offices of the Church  viz  Because his Coming in the Flesh was prior to all the Transactions the other Offices were compil'd of And as by the  Advent  of our Lord there was a Renovation of Things agreeable to that of St  John  Rev  xxi  Behold I make all Things new  so the Church in Honour of his  Advent  begins her Year of Offices at the Time of Renovation  THIS  Advent  lies in four Weeks tho' as the Ritualists tell us these four Weeks are never held intire  The Church  say they  hath set these apart to denote and point out the  Fourfold Coming  of Christ and that the last is  ChristmassEve they say is no Part of  Advent  and therefore the last Week is never compleat  incompleat because when he makes his last Appearance the Glory of his Saints shall have no End The first Week  say they  of this Holy Season represents to us his Coming in the Flesh of which it was said  Mat  xxi  Hosanna to the Son of  David  Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord  The second denotes his Coming and Descent into the Hearts of the Faithful of which it is said  John  xiv  We will come unto him and make our Abode with him  and of which also that in the  Prophet  relates to  Habb  ii  Tho' it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry  The third signifies his  Third Advent  which is in the Hour of Death to which that of St  James  relates  Be ye also Patient stablish your Hearts for the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh  The fourth is an Emblem of his last Coming when he shall come in Majesty to judge the World of which it is said in the Propet  Isai  iii  The Lord will enter into Judgment with the Ancients of his People  THUS the Church delineates these four Comings of our Saviour in her setting apart the four Weeks of these Seasons Tho' it is observable in her Offices appointed for them she only commemorates two of them  viz  his Coming in  the Flesh and his Coming to Judgment for his Coming in the  Flesh  and his Coming into the  Hearts of good Men  are in Effect but one Coming as are also his Coming at  the Hour of Death and in the Day of Judgment  Of the  COLLECTS  THE Collects are most of them of great Antiquity as is evident from many Authorities They are so called either  Microl c    because the Priest that officiated collected into them the Devotions of the People or as being used upon the People's being collected or gathered together or as others think and with greater Probability because of their being chiefly collected from the Epistles and Gospels But however this be they are the Breathings of the Holiest Times and have been used by the best of Men and must therefore be acknowledged of great Benefit and Advantage  Of the  EPISTLES  and  GOSPELS  THE  Epistles  and  Gospels  are of equal Antiquity with the Collects and are ranged in an admirable Order following each other in a natural Series of Things and expressing the History of the Season they relate to They are divided as the Year is into two Parts the one beginning at  Advent  and ending at  Trinity Sunday  the other then beginning and ending at  Advent  The Former shews us the Example of our Lord the Latter instructs us how to follow his Example  The first Sunday in  Advent  _THE Collect for this Day is taken out of the  Epistle  and  Gospel  and has a twofold View the one to remind us of his Coming in the  Flesh  the other of his Coming to  Judgment  It therefore implores the  Grace  of God that now in our Saviour's first  Advent  when he came to visit us as  the Prophet  intimates in the  Gospel in great Humility  we  may so cast off the Works of Darkness  mentioned in the  Epistle  that at his second Coming we may rise to the Life of Light and Glory  The EPISTLE is an Exhortation to Love which is in Effect the Fulfilling of the whole Law And this it also excites us to from the present Consideration of Things  That now it is high Time to awake out of Sleep The Night is far spent the Day is at Hand  Which tho' first of all wrote by the Apostle to the Christian Converts to shake off their Sleep and Drowsiness and excite them to Vigilancy and Activity in the christian Life And tho' the  Night  here will undoubtedly signifie the Time of Life in which we grope about and wander in  Darkness in Comparison of that Day we shall afterwards behold  Cor  i  when the Vail shall be taken away and  we shall  no longer  see through a Glass darkly  yet it also must remind us of the Circumstances of the present Season and bring into our Minds that Night which hung upon the World before our Saviour's Coming and how it was dispelled and driven away by the  Dayspring from on high  When then these Words are read  the Night is far spent  c Our Hearts should be filled with Joy and Comfort For they should represent to us the World's long lying in Darkness that now the Shadows are fleeing away and that the Sun of Righteousness is approaching That the Nativity of the Messiah the Saviour of the World is near  The GOSPEL of our Saviour's Riding to  Jerusalem  has been the Peculiar of this first Sunday in Advent  Microl de Eccles Obs c    from ancient Times It seems indeed rather proper for  PalmSunday  which was the Day he made this Journey on to his Passion and is accordingly used by some Churches But yet when we consider the Words  Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest i e  blessed be his Coming in the Flesh for which is due the greatest Hosannahs we may see manisestly its Harmony to the Season in the  Bish Spar Rat Dur lib    c    Opinion of both the Ancient and Moderns and also how agreeable it is to the Epistle which tells us  Now is our Salvation near the Day is at Hand  c  The second SUNDAY in  Advent  THE Collect is taken out of the Epistle which mentions that  whatever Things were written aforetime were written for our Learning that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have hope  And therefore it says a little after  as it is written  and so mentions some Prophecies relating to our Saviour's first Coming into the World The Collect therefore will appear very suitable for the Time if it be consider'd as a Petition to God that we may receive all  Coll  his holy World  and at this Season that Part of it in particular which Prophesies of our Lord's first Coming into the World that  me may be  Fpist  comforted by it and ever hold fast the blessed  Epist  Hope of everlasting Life  The EPISTLE treats of our Lord's first Advent and in a particular Manner how he came to save us of the  Gentile  World and mentions some Prophecies relating to us that we may be  comforted  by them and  Epist  glorifie God for his Mercy  As first that in the th  Psalm For this Cause I will confess to the among the  Gentiles  and sing Praises unto thy Name  And that in  Deuteronomy  the xxxii  Rejoyce ye  Gentiles  with his People  And again  Psalm  the cxvii  Praise him all ye  Gentiles  and laud him all ye People  And lastly  Isaiah  in his xi Chapter says  There shall be a Root of  Jesse  and he that shall rise to reign over the  Gentiles  in him shall the  Gentiles  trust  The GOSPEL treats of our Lord's second Coming to judge the World as the Epistle did of his first Coming into it Which may teach us That those Men who will not receive the First Coming of their Saviour will be compell'd to acknowledge Him at his Second They who will not  Epist  confess to him among the  Gentiles  shall have  Gosp  Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those Things which are coming on the Earth  at the Day of Judgment But on the contrary  Epist  they who are filled with all Joy and Peace in believing and abound in Hope through the Power of the Holy Ghost when  Gosp  these Things begin to come to pass they shall look up and lift up their Heads because their Redemption draweth nigh  Thus the Church in this Day's Office prepares us for the first Coming of our Lord by threatening us with the Terrors of his Second by assuring us we must bear the Troubles of that  EvilDay  if we answer not the End and Design of our Saviour's first Coming by leading holy and religious Lives  The third SUNDAY in  Advent  THIS Week being the last of the  Four Seasons  or  Ember Weeks  set apart by the Church for the Dedicating of the Seasons to God and imploring his Blessing upon the Ordinations then perform'd the Church hath made the Collect suitable to this Occasion Not that she forgets our Saviour's first Advent but along with it takes Notice of the Practice of this Season  THE Collect is taken out of the Epistle and Gospel and is a Petition to our Lord that  Epist  the Ministers and Stewards of his Mysteries  may in like Manner  Gosp  prepare his Way  against his Coming to Judgment as  Gosp  his Messenger at his first Coming prepar'd it before him  The EPISTLE treats of the Ministers of God's Word and of our Saviour's second Advent shewing the Dignity of their Office and how wrong it is in the World to throw its Censures upon them as is frequently done that they should be left to the Judgement of the Lord who when he comes the second Time to  Mat  xviii  take an Account of his Servants will render to every One according to their Works  The GOSPEL treats of our Saviour's first Coming and gives us the History of  John  's Sending two of his Disciples to him who were to learn from himself  Whether it was he that should come or they were to look for another  This the Baptist did not to satisfy any Doubt of his own for he was perfectly convinc'd of the Truth of our Saviour's Mission but that as he was shortly to leave the World his Disciples who were not as yet fully satisfied might be convinc'd and become his Disciples  THE Close of this Gospel  Behold I send my Messenger c  seems to have been the chief Reason of the Church's Using this Gospel at this Season that it might teach us that the Way of the Lord was to be prepared by his Messenger and that therefore we must expect this Messenger before the Lord himself come  THE Character our Saviour gives of  John  of his Constancy in the Faith and his Austerity of Life makes the Gospel also answerable to the  Ember Season  The fourth SUNDAY in  Advent  THE Collect prays for Christ's  Coming and Succour  in a most ardent Manner that the  Sins and Wickedness  which stop us in our christian Race may be removed through  Grace and Mercy  the Consequents of our Saviour's Coming in the Flesh  The EPISTLE does as it were point out the Coming of our Lord not as at a Distance but in hast and immediately  The Lord is at Hand  How seasonably therefore does it advise us  to Rejoyce in the Lord  As it were exhorting us to be chearful because of the  Messiah  's near and speedy Coming into the World  As the GOSPEL of the last Sunday told us of the Messenger who should prepare the Way before our Lord's Coming so the present Gospel shews us this Messenger in the Exercise of his Errand in an actual Preparation for Christ's Coming and  making straight the Way of the Lord  And these Words  There standeth One among you whom ye know not he it is who coming  c are very agreeable to the Season They do all but bring the Messiah And as the Epistle tells us  That he is at Hand  so here the Gospel tells us as it were that his Manifestation is so near that he is  even just now among  us  but we know him not yet  Which is answering exactly the  Nearness of this Sunday to Christmassday before which Time  we knew him not  CHRISTMASSDAY  HE whom we have been expecting in this Season of Advent and whom the Offices of that Season spoke of as Coming has now really come and appear'd in the World and therefore the Offices speak no longer of a State of Expectancy but of a State of Fruition They speak not of him as coming but really come  THE Collect mentions him as born at this Time and prays that we may be regenerated and made the Children of God by Adoption and Grace and be daily renewed by the Holy Spirit which are the Benefits of Christ's Birth  The EPISTLE speaks of his being actually come into the World and assures us  That in these last Days  God hath  spoken unto us by his Son  The GOSPEL also answers the Season as it speaks of our Saviour's being come into the World  He was in the World and He came unto his own  Saint  STEPHEN'S  Day  THERE are several Reasons given for the Placing of this and the two following Festivals in the Order they now stand immediately after Christ's Nativity and before the Rest  of the Saints The most probable of which seems to be this as our Lord in his Gospel says  If any Man will come after me let him take up his Cross and follow me  So it hath pleased the Wisdom of the Church that those who took up their Cross and followed him by Martyrdom should be first in his Retinue Now there are three Sorts of Martyrdom one in  Will  and in  Deed  another in  Will  not in  Deed  the other in  Deed  not in  Will  Saint  Stephen  's Martyrdom being therefore the First and Highest of those it hath deservedly the first Place after our Saviour Yesterday says St  Austin  we celebrated the Birth Day of the  King of Martyrs  born in the World and to Day the  first of Martyrs  going out of the World It was fit the Immortal should first take upon him Flesh for Mortals that so the  Mortal  might despise Death for the  Immortal  The Lord was therefore born to die for his Servant that the Servant might not fear to die for his Lord Christ was born in Earth that  Stephen  might be born in Heaven  THE Collect acknowledging  with the Martyr of the Day  the Divinity of our Lord prays to him in Imitation of the Martyr that in  all our Sufferings here for the Testimony of the Truth  we may with him  look up stedfastly into Heaven and by Faith behold the Glory which shall be revealed And being filled with the Holy Ghost  as he was  we may learn  from him to pray for our Persecutors to our Lord  who standeth at the Right Hand of God  as he saw him to Succour those who suffer for him  The EPISTLE is the Story of  Stephen  's Martyrdom  The GOSPEL is very suitable to the Occasion as it mentions our Saviour's Prophecy of the Treatment that his Followers should have among the Jews especially as it speaks of their  stoneing them which were sent unto them  and in instancing  Chron  II XXIV  Zacharias  who was stoned to Death and as it also makes mention of  Abel  who was the  Protomartyr  of the Old Testament as St  Stephen  was of the New  Saint  JOHN'S  Day  THE Festival of St  John  stands next to that of St  Stephen  because his Martyrdom was next in Kind to that of St  Stephen  's that is he was a Martyr in  Will  tho' not in  Deed  For he was miraculously delivered from the Caldron of  Boiling Oil  which he was thrown into at  Rome  coming out without any Maim or Hurt  THE Collect from the Light mentioned in the Epistle prays for the Illumination of the Church that it may be enlightened by the mysterious Doctrines of the Apostle of this Day and so walk in that  Light  as at last to obtain that  Light  which we are told in the Epistle is  God  The EPISTLE mentions  the Doctrine of this holy Apostle and Evangelist  which the Collect prays the Church may be enlightened by  viz  the Doctrine of our Lord's Divinity which he so sublimely treats of in his Gospel beginning it in the same Manner he begins the present Epistle It was the Handling of this lofty Doctrine  that made him be compar'd to an Eagle flying within the Clouds beyond the narrow Sight of Men and for which also he has the peculiar Character of  John  the  Divine  The GOSPEL is that famous Passage where our Saviour Answers the Curiosity of  Peter  about the Death of  John If I will that he tarry 'till I come what is that to thee Follow thou me  Which though some of them interpreted that  John  therefore should not die yet we have both the Word of  John  himself which teaches us that  Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee  And also Ecclesiastical History assuring us that he did die For he dy'd twentyeight Years after our Lord came to destroy the City  Jerusalem  which is the Coming spoken of in the Gospel  The  INNOCENTS  Day  NEXT to the Feast of St  John  stands the Day of the  Holy Innocents  Their Martyrdom being that of the last Kind a Martyrdom in  Deed  not in  Will  They shewed not forth the Praise of the Lord in speaking but in dying for him For for his Sake and in his Stead were they slain Thus beautifully and wisely are these Festivals placed after the Birth of Christ They answer as it were the Church's Description of him in the  Canticles  Cant  v  My beloved is White and Ruddy and the Chiefest among ten thousand  For he is white in the Chastity and Purity of  John  ruddy in the  Blood of  Stephen  and the Chiefest among ten thousand by the suffering Innocents  THE Collect prays God who out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings hast ordained Strength and made the Infants of  Bethlehem  to give him Glory by their Deaths  to mortify in us all Vices  that we may have the Innocency of this Day's Martyrs and be so strengthened with his Grace that if call'd upon to suffer we may be constant in the Faith even to Death and so may glorify his Holy Name  The EPISTLE is no doubt a Discription of the whole Church in Christ but yet there are several Things in it suitable to this Occasion as it describes in particular the Martyrs of the Day for it says  These are they which are not defiled with Women for they are Virgins These were redeemed from among Men being the first Fruits unto God and to the Lamb And in their Mouth was found no Guile For they were without Fault before the Throne of God  The GOSPEL give's the History of  Joseph  's Flight into  Egypt  with our Lord and the Murdering of the Children of  Bethlehem  The SUNDAY after  Christmass  IT was usual in the primitive Times for some Part of the Offices of great Festivals to be repeated every Day 'till the Octave or eighth Day after which was the last Day of its being repeated and the End of the Festival The  Church therefore in Imitation of this ancient Custom has the Collect of ChristmassDay for this Day also which generally falls within the Octave of Christmass Bishop  Sparrow  tells us the Observation of Octaves is done out of Honour to the Feast and that greater Solemnities have some Days after them to continue the Memory of them  THE Reason of their being lengthen'd to eight Days is taken from the  Jews  who observ'd some of their higher Festivals for the  Amar Gor Lib    c    same Number of Days it being thought by the primitive Church that those Jewish Feasts which were only the Shadow should by no Means exceed their Feasts which were the Substance  BUT according to others there  Rupert de Divin Offic Lib    c    b Juon Carnot Serm de Circum  c  is a mystical Meaning in the Observation of Octaves and that is that the Octave is an Emblem of the Mystical eight Day which is the Day of the Resurrection For as on that Day we shall return to our former Innocence so the Church as an Emblem of it repeats on the Octave and the Days between the Festival and it some of the first Days Office thereby teaching us that if we continue in the Worship of God after being regenerated by Baptism we shall on the Octave of the Resurrection after the seven Days of our Life have passed away return to our first Purity and Holiness  The EPITLE treats of our Saviour's Birth and mentions the Advantages accruing to us from thence That whereas before the Church of  God  like an Heir under Age differed nothing from a Servant  being burthened with Ceremonies and the Observations of the Law it was now by the Coming of his Son arriv'd at Maturity and freed from those Incumbrances so that its Members  are  no more  Servants  But Sons and Heirs of God through Christ  THE Church seems to have chosen this EPISTLE with a View to our Saviour's Infancy  For the Heir under Age differing nothing from a Servant tho' he be Lord of all  is no obscure or mean Remembrancer of our Saviour's Condition at this time  Heb  i  who was appointed Heir of all Things and  Phil  ii  yet took upon him the Form of a Servant  tho' he  Acts  x  was Lord of all  The GOSPEL also treats of our Saviour's Birth and is an Explication of  God's  Epist  sending forth his Son made of a Woman when the fullness of Time was come  For it relates to the Human Nature of our Lord as that of ChristmassDay does to the Divine  The  CIRCUMCISIONS  of CHRIST  THIS Day tho' the Octave of Christmassday  Isidor c    de Eccl Offic  was formerly observed a Fast by the Church because of those Sports and abominable Customs practis'd on it by the Heathen in Honour of their God  Janus  Afterwards it was changed into the Feast of the Circumcision it being the  Day from the Nativity of our Lord and therefore the Day on which he was circumcised according to the Command given to  Abraham  Gen  xvii  He that is eight Days old shall be circumcised among you  THE Collect is a Petition to God that  as he made his own Son to be circumcised  so he would grant us the  Circumcision of the Spirit  which is  the Cutting off from our Hearts and Members all worldly Lusts  That as our Lord by the Circumcision of the Flesh was obedient to the Law so we by  the Circumcision of the Spirit may be obedient to his Will  The EPISTLE also is very suitable to the Festival as it shews who they are that are the Blessed of God whether those of the Circumcision or those of the Uncircumcision That those who follow the Faith of our  Father Abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised  will have Righteousness imputed unto them as he had and be numbered among the  Blessed  tho' they are not of the Circumcision  The GOSPEL is also very proper for the Occasion which as it mentions the  Circumcising of the Child after eight Days  is exactly suitable to the Feast of the Circumcision  Of the  EPIPHANY  _THIS Day is called by the Church  the Epiphany  which in  Greek  signifies  Manifestation  It is called in our CommonPrayer Book particularly  the Manifestation of Christ to the  Gentiles because on this Day our Lord was manifested to the Gentile World by the appearing of  a Star  to the Wise Men in the East that they might be conducted to Worship their Saviour  THE Collect is very suitable and full of Devotion and begs of God who by a Star manifested his Son Jesus to the Gentiles to grant us after this Life the Fruition of himself whom we only know now by Faith  The EPISTLE answers the Nature of the Season and tells us  that the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs and of the same Body and Partakers of his Promise in Christ by the Gospel and that St  Paul  preach'd among the Gentiles the unsearchble Riches of Christ  The GOSPEL is the History of the Star's Appearing to the  Wise men in the East  and how it guided them to the Place where our Saviour was  BUT this is not the only  Manifestation  which the Church commemorates this Day there are other two besides one the  Manifestation  of the most  glorious Trinity  at his  Baptism  the other that of his own  Divinity  when he turn'd the Water into Wine  at the Marriage of  Cana  in Gallilee  The First of these the Church commemorates in the second Lesson at  Morning Prayer  and the  Latter  in the second Lesson at  Evening  The Reason why the Church celebrates these three  Manifestations  on this Day of the  Epiphany  is because they all happened upon this same Day  Durand Lib de Fest Ep  tho' in different Years  The first SUNDAY after the  Epiphany  THE Collect prays that we may have a right Knowledge of our Duty and sufficient Strength to perform it  The EPISTLE mentions the Things the Collect prays for and is first an Exhortation to Mortification and Chastity dly to the  Renewing of our Minds  and thereby in Effect to hope Prayer and Obedience dly to Unity  as we are Members one of another  Now these three Things are the Virtues pointed out to us by the Wise Men's Offerings The  Myrrh  they offer'd signifies the First The  Incense  they offer'd signifies the Second And the  Gold  they offered signifies the Third How suitable then is this  Epistle  to this Season For in the Gospel for the  Epiphany  we have the  Wise Men  making their  Offerings and in this Epistle for the Sunday following we are exhorted to imitate them  The GOSPEL of this Day is also very suitable to the Season For as this Sunday is the next after the  Epiphany  so the First memorable Action we meet with of our Saviour in his younger Years is this of his Coming up to  Jerusasalem  at  Twelve Years of Age  and disputing with the  Jewish  Doctors At  Comber in Catechis  thirteen Years of Age the Jews were wont to bring their Children to the House of God there to be publickly examined and being then approv'd they were then declared to be  Children of the Precept  that is obliged to keep the Law And whereas our Saviour came up at twelve Years old it was because of his Pregnancy according to that saying of the Rabbins  the Ingenious do run before the Command  IT is observalbe that as from  Christmass to Epiphany  the Church in her Offices sets forth Christ's Humanity so from the  Epiphany  to  Septuagesima  she sets forth his Divinity In the present Gospel it is  Manifested  when he says to his Mother  Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's Business  For he says in another Place  all Things that the Father hath are mine  and therefore he attests that in the same Manner the Temple belonged to his Father it belonged to him  Bed in Dom post Epiph  The second SUNDAY after the  Epiphany  THE Collect having acknowledged God who wrought the Miracle in the Gospel  to be the Governour of all Things in Heaven and Earth  prays  that the would mercifully hear the Supplications of his People and grant them that Peace all the Days of their Life  which the Epistle puts them into the Method of acquiring  The EPISTLE also is conformable to our Saviour's Goodness in the Gospel and adviseth us to a Right Use of the  Gifts  God hath bestowed on us of whatsoever Kind they be that we should not keep them to our selves but make them of Service and Advantage to others  That we should be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love and of the same Mind one towards another  The GOSPEL gives us and Example of our Saviour's Goodness in supplying the Wants and Necessities of others by his  Turning the Water into Wine  It is used on this Day as being the History of our Saviour's first Miracle and therefore what most naturally follows his Going up to  Jerusalem  And because also it manifests as is observ'd above the  Sundays after the Epiphany  do manifest the Divinity of our Lord For it is only in the Power of God to change the Nature of Things  The third SUNDAY after the  Epiphany  THE Collect considering the  Mercy  of our Lord in the Gospel desires God  mercifully to look upon our Infirmities  and from his  Gosp  Putting forth his Hand to cleanse the Leper  it prays that he would be pleased  to stretch forth his Right Hand  to defend us in Dangers and help us in Necessities  Durand in Domin    post Epiph  The EPISTLE tho' at first Sight it seems not any Way agreeable to the Gospel yet if taken in the mystical Sense will appear very suitable to it For as the Gospel relates our Saviour's Cure of the Leper so the Epistle tells us how we may prevent the  Leprosy of Sin Be not wise in your own Conceits  will teach us how to prevent the Leprosy of Pride and  recompence to no Man Evil for Evil  how we may not be infected with Envy and Malice  The GOSPEL is the History of our Lord's Curing the  Leper  and the Centurion's Servant who was sick of the  Palsie  It seems to have been pitched upon as suitable after our Lord's  Epiphany  as being a clear Manifestation of his Divinity In the Cure of the  Leper  he shewed forth his Almighty Power and in curing the other at a Distance he gave an undeniable Proof of his Omnipresence  The fourth SUNDAY after the  Epiphany  THE Collect is founded upon the Gospel and because  we are set  as were the Disciples of our Lord amidst Waves and Storms and since  through the Weakness of our Nature  we often as they did imagine  we perish  it therefore prays God  to support us in all Dangers and carry us through all Temptations  as our Lord supported his Disciples in the midst of Seas and Tempests  The EPISTLE if rightly consider'd is not  nsuitable to the Gospel It speaks the Power  f Christ upon Earth by  His Ministers  as the Gospel does that of his own Word upon the  ea and as by the later he asswages the Winds  nd Waves and makes  a great Calm  so by the  ormer he asswages the swelling Waves of a  empestuous World and becalms and quiets  he Madness of the People  The GOSPEL seems to have been chosen  or this Season because it is a Manifestation of our Saviour's Divinity His Commanding of the Winds and Seas speaks him to be no other than He at  whose Word the stormy Wind ariseth and  steth up the Waves thereof and who maketh the Storm to cease so that the Waves thereof are still  The fifth SUNDAY after the  Epiphany  THE Collect prays for such Holy Men as are mentioned in the Epistle for  the merciful and meek and charitable  which constitute  the Church  and Houshold of GOD  THE EPISTLE exhorts us to be Part of that  Houshold  by putting on the Bowels of  Mercy and Kindness and above all Charity which is the very Bond of perfectness  The GOSPEL under a Parable mentions the last  Manifestation or Epiphany of our Saviour  viz his Coming to Judgment when the  Tares  will be burnt but the  Wheat gathered into the Barn  The Angels who are here called the  Reapers  shall at the  Time of Harvest  or at the End of the World gather together the  Tares  which are the Emblems of the Wicked that they may be burnt But they shall gather the  Wheat  that is just Men into God's  Barn to the general Assembly of the first Born where  Thes  iv  they shall ever be with the Lord  THE  Collect  then of this Day prays for the Safety of good Men The  Epistle  advises us to be of their Number and the  Gospel  shews the Greatness of their Reward  The sixth SUNDAY after the  Epiphany  Wheatley Com Prayer  THE Collect Epistle and Gospel for this Sunday were all  added at the last Review 'till when if there happened to be six Sundays after the  Epiphany  the  Collect Epistle and Gospel  for the fifth Sunday was repeated  The Office therefore for this Sunday is of the same Nature with that of the last and treats of our Saviour's last Epiphany when he comes to judge the Quick and the Dead  THE Collect desires God in the Words of the  Epistle whose Son was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil and make us the Sons of God that having this Hope we may purify our selves even as he is pure and that when our Lord shall appear in the Power and great Glory  mentioned in the Gospel we may enjoy what the  Epistle tells us will be the Portion of good Men viz  to be made like unto him  in his eternal and glorious Kingdom  The EPISTLE very suitably to the Season of the  Epiphany  mentions our Saviour's first Mafestation and tells us  He was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil  And it also very suitably as this is the last Sunday after the Epiphany in Conformity to the Gospel takes notice of our Saviour's last Appearance and tells us  We shall then be like him and see him as he is  The GOSPEL treats of the last Epiphany of our Saviour and is therefore very fitly adapted to this Sunday it being as it was just now observ'd in the Epistle the last Sunday after the  Epiphany  The Collect prays that we may be with him in his Kingdom The Epistle shews  that if we would see him as he is we must purifie our selves  c The Gospel opens the Scene of the Day of Judgment and our Lord's last Epiphany and shews that those the  Collect  prays for and the  Epistle  gives advice to  will be gathered together by the Angels from the four Winds from the one End of Heaven to the other  Septuagesima  Sunday  THERE are many Reasons given by the  Roman Ritualists  for the Names of this and the two following Sundays the most probable of which seems both to them and others to be  propter Consequentiam Numerandi  For the fin  Sunday in Lent being called  Quadragesima  because it is about forty Days from  Easter  the Sunday before is called  Quinquagesima  because  Quinquagesima  is the next round Number abo  Quadragesima  And so in like Manner the  ther two Sundays as they are still further r  +moved from  Easter  so they answer to the ne  great Numbers and are therefore called  Sex  gesima  and  Septuagesima  THE Design of the Church in setting ap  this Time was to prepare her Members for  Lent Fast  And therefore former the  Dur in Septuag  Regulars  began to fast after  Septuagesima  the  Greeks  after  Sex  gesima  the  Clergy  after  Quinquagesima  and  whole Christian Church on  AshWednesday  THE Collect very seasonably prays to be d  livered from Sin and Punishment which we  never be freed from without the Struggles a  Hardships of Mortification  The EPISTLE therefore persuades us  the Exercise of the Duties of the Christian Li  which are here represented to us under the Na  of a  Race  Teaching us  That as they who str  for the Mastery in a Race are temperate in  Things  so should we be in all our Conversation  We should keep under our Body and bring  into Subjection  by Acts of Pennance and Mortification if we would receive the Prize here me  tioned  The incorruptible Crown  The GOSPEL assures us that the Rewar  is not to be acquir'd without Labour that the Toil of the Christian Life is absolutely Necessary to the Gaining of the Heavenly and that without our  Cross  we shall wear no  Crown If we stand idle in the MarketPlace all the Day long we have no Wages to expect in the Evening  but  if we labour in the Vineyard we shall receive our Penny  Sexagesima  Sunday  THE Collect is a Prayer to God for his Aid and Assistance in all Dangers and Adversities that we may be supported by his  Power  as was the  Apostle St Paul  in all the Adversities the  Epistle  mentions  The EPISTLE before persuades us to the Duty of Pennance and Austerity and the present Epistle gives us a noble Example for our Imitation that of the Sufferings of the  Great St Paul  who by having in him  that Trust  which the  Collect  mentions surmounted the greatest of Dangers and bravely underwent the most mortifying Pennance  He suffered Stripes and Imprisonment and Deaths oft he was beaten and stoned and suffered Shipwrack a Night and a Day he had been in the Deep  in a Word he endur'd the greatest Hardships of Earth and Sea Nor were his voluntary Sufferings much Inferiour  He was more abundant in Labours than others in Journeying often in Weariness and Painfulness in Watchings and Fastings often in Cold and Nakedness  The GOSPEL is the Parable of the Sower and answers of the Epistle in telling us the Dangers we are in when we neglect the Duties the Apostle St  Paul  was so eminent an Example of For it is observable that the  Seed  fell in four Places and brought forth but in one which as it intimates to us that scarce one in four attain Salvation so it lets us plainly see the Necessity of Mortification especially when it tells us  That they on the good Ground bring forth Fruit with Patience  The Higher they rise in Piety the greater will be their Tryals the nearer they are to Heaven the greater are their Temptations  But  Luke  xxi  in their Patience they possess their Soulds till  Acts  xiv  through much Tribulation they enter into the Kingdom of God  Quinquagesima  Sunday  THE Collect for this Sunday prays for the most excellent Gift of Charity which is so beautifully commended in the Epistle  The EPISTLE is very suitably chosen by the Church For the two last Sundays having proposed to our Imitation in the Coming  Lent  some of the sublimest Acts of Mortification and given us one of the greatest Examples of it she now treats of Charity the very Bond of Peace and of all Virtues to shew us that all the Doings of Austerity and Pennance  without Charity are nothing Worth  The GOSPEL teaches us the Story of the Blind Beggar to add to our Charity Faith that we may rightly perform the Duties recommended to us  Spar Rat  For by Faith our Darkness is enlightened as the Blind Man's Eyes were who wisely desired that he might see for in Sight of God consists our Happiness  One of the Ritualists observes that these three Gospels are placed in a very rational Order In  Septuagesima  says he the  Vineyard  is dressed in  Sexagesima  the  Seed  is sown and in  Quinquagesima  the  Fruit  of Light is gathered the Light of that Place  which needs no Candle neither the Light of the Sun  ASHWEDNESDAY  THE Word  Lent  in the Saxon Tongue signifies  Spring  and because this Time of Fasting begins in the  Spring  it therefore borrows its Name from the Season and is called  Lent  THIS Fast is of such great Antiquity that is seems to have been used from the Days of the Apostles It is of forty Days Continuance beginning at  Ashwednesday  and ending at  Easterday  the Sundays excepted which were always Festivals in Memory of our Saviour's Resurrection  THE Reason of its continuing forty Days is because that forty Days were of old the allowed and stated Times of great Fasts Witness the Fasts of  Moses  and  Elias  But the chief Reason with us is that our Saviour Fasted forty Days  IT always ends at  Easters  to point out to us that as our Saviour's Sufferings were done away at his Resurrection so after the Troubles of this Life which are shadowed out by the Time of  Lent  we shall enjoy Peace and Rest and a glorious Resurrection which are shadowed out to us by  Easter  THIS is called  Ash Wednesday  Wheat Com Prayer  from a Custom in the ancient Discipline the Loss of which Custom or Godly Discipline our Church laments in her Office for this Day called the  Commination  which began to be very early exercised on this Day an Account whereof we have in  Gratian  as follows  ON the first Day of  Lent  the Penitents were to present themselves before the  Bishop  cloathed with Sackcloth with naked Feet and Eyes turn'd to the Ground And this was to be done in the Presence of the principal Clergy of the Diocess who were to judge of the Sincerity of their Repentance These introduced them into the Church where the Bishop all in Tears and the Rest of the Clergy repeated the seven Penitential Psalms Then rising from Prayers they threw Ashes upon them and covered their Heads with Sackcloth and then with mournful Sighs declar'd to them that as  Adam  was thrown out of Paradise so they must be thrown out of the Church Then the Bishop commanded the Officers to turn them out of the Church Doors and all the Clergy followed after repeating that Curse upon  Adam In the Sweat of thy Brows thou shalt eat thy Bread  THE Collect for this Day prays that God would send us  new and contrite Hearts  that we may lament our Sins in a sincere and unfeigned Manner and so obtain the Pardon and Remission of them  THE Portion of Scripture for the Epistle is taken out of the Prophet  Joel  and exhorts us to what the Collect prays for  viz to turn to the Lord with all our Hearts to fast and weep and mourn and to rent our Hearts  And then to rest assured that the  God of all Mercy will repent him of the Evil  and give us perfect Remission and Forgiveness  The GOSPEL cautions us to be sorrowful in the Manner the Epistle mentions lest if we appear only with the external Signs of Sorrow we receive the Reward of the Hypocrites  who only disfigure their Faces that they may appear to Men to fast  It may also teach us that as we hope God will be merciful to us we should also be merciful to the Poor by giving to them what we save by Fasting If we do so we lay up  Treasure in Heaven  if not it is only  Treasure which the Moth and Rust doth corrupt  c  The first Sunday in  Lent  THE Collect is a Prayer to Christ which shews the Church believes him to be God It is very suitable to this Season of Fasting and Abstinence and prays our Lord that in Imitation of his Fasting  forty Days and forty Nights  we may  by his Grace use such Abstinence as to subdue the Flesh to the Spirit and so ever obey his Godly Motions  The EPISTLE exhorts us to  Patience in all Things  belonging to our Spiritual Warfare whether  we be in Afflictions in Watchings in Fastings  or whatever Condition else  The GOSPEL is the History of our Saviour's being tempted and his Conquest over Temptations and is therefore highly suitable for our Entrance on our spiritual Combat in this Season of Lent our great  Day of Battle  as it emboldens and animates us with the Hopes of Victory against our spiritual Enemies For we know in that  he himself suffered and was tempted he is able to succour them which are tempted  THE Epistle and Gospel are also not unsuitable to the  There be four  EmberWeeks  call'd in Latin  Jejunia Quatuor temporum  The Fasts of the four Seasons because they were kept in the four Parts of the Year  Spring Summer Autumn Winter  The First of these begins upon  Wednesday  next after  AshWednesday  the d upon  Wednesday  next after  Whitsunday  the d upon  Wednesday  next after  HolyCross Sept  The last upon  Wednesday  next after St  Lucy Dec  The Days of Fasting and Prayers in those Weeks are  Wednesday Friday  and  Saturday Wednesday  because then our Lord was betrayed by  Judas Fryday  because then he was crucified  Saturday  because then we represent the Apostles Sorrows for the Loss of their Lord lying in the Grave The Causes of such religious Fastings and Prayers were formerly many as namely That Christians in these religious Duties might let the World know that they were as devout as the  Jews  had formerly been whose Custom it was to observe four solemn Fasts  Zach  that they might dedicate to God as the first Fruits the Beginning of the several Seasons of the Year set a part to his religious Worship and by this Means obtain God's Blessing upon them the Remainders of those Times But the principal Cause was for Preparation to the solemn Ordination of Ministers Holy Church imitating the Apostles Practice who when they were to set  apart Men to the Ministry prayed and fasted  before they laid on their Hands  Act  xiii  Spar Rat Com  Pr  EmberWeek  beginning on this Day The Epistle shews how a Minister should behave himself in his Calling and the Gospel what he must expect to meet with after he has enter'd on it No sooner did our Saviour enter on his publick Ministry than he was  tempted of the Devil  and we know  the Servant is not greater than his Lord  The second SUNDAY in  Lent  THE Collect after acknowledging from the Petition of the Woman in the Gospel  viz Lord help me  that we have no Power of our selves  to help our selves  prays God that he would keep us outwardly in our Bodies from all Adversities and inwardly in our Souls from all evil Thoughts  The EPISTLE exhorts us to avoid all Uncleaness and be studious of Holiness which is undoubtedly very fit Advice at this Season when we are more particularly assaulted  both outwardly in our Bodies and inwardly in our Souls  The GOSPEL put us into the Method of obtaining what the Epistle persuades us to by giving us the Story of our Lord's Curing the Woman and  Canaan  's Daughter that was vexed  with a Devil As she by her steady Faith and earnest Prayer crying  Have Mercy on me O Lord thou Son of  David  and Lord help me  got the Devil thrown out of her Daughter so may we in like Manner be disposess'd of the  uncle all Spirit  of Lust and Incontinence  The third SUNDAY in  Lent  THE Collect with a View to the  Finger of God  and  that stronger Man  mentioned in the Gospel desires God to stretch forth  the right Hand of his Majesty  to be our Defence against all our Enemies  AS the Season of Pennance is thus far advanced the Church is careful that her Sons should not flag but rise in their Piety and therefore the Epistle does not only persuade us to  avoid Fornication  and Sins of a deeper Colour  but even foolish Talking and Jesting which are not convenient  both as they are unbecoming the Gravity of this penitential Season and are sinful in their own Nature  The GOSPEL confirms the Advice of the Epistle and Endeavours after our Continuance in our holy Violences by shewing us the Danger of  II  Pet      falling from our own Stedfastness and how needful it is for us to grow in Grace  For it assures us  If the unclean Spirit which hath been once cast out of a Man eater into him again the last State of that Man is then worse than the First  This GOSPEL as it aims at our Keeping out the unclean Spirit when he is once dispossessed is very fitly placed after that of the last Sunday which shews us the Way of getting him cast out  The fourth SUNDAY in  Lent  IN the last Sundays Office the Church laid before us the Danger of Lapsing from the Austerities of the Season and having now brought us to the  This Sunday is called MidlentSunday  Middle of the thorny Way of Mortification she chears and comforts us with the  End of our Journey and the Promise of Refreshment  lest we faint upon the Road  THE Collect having acknowledged that for our evil Deeds we worthily deserve to be punished prays God that we may mercifully be  relieved  by the Comfort of his Grace  The EPISTLE encourages us to go on chearfully in our holy Pennance and Hardships as it tells us of  the  Jerusalem  which is above which is free  from all these Troubles and where we shall be  relieved  with everlasting Comforts  The GOSPEL tells of Christ's  Relieving  the five Thousand miraculously intimating to us that after the Hunger we suffer here we shall be refreshed by our Lord  For blessed are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness for they shall be filled  There is also another Reason  of this Gospels being read at this Time which see in the th Sunday after Trinity  THIS Sunday is also called  Dominica de Panibus the Sunday of the Loaves  or  Dominica Refectionis  the Sunday of  Refreshment  Because it does not treat of Mortification but tells of the  heavenly  Jerusalem and that Refreshment our Saviour will there give us Mr  Wheatley  says  or perhaps it is so called from the first Lesson in the Morning which gives us the History of  Joseph  's Entertaining his Brethren  And he adds  That the Appointment of the Gospel and the first Lesson for this Day might probably give the first Rise to a Custom still retain'd in many Parts of  England  and well known by the Name of  Midlenting or Mothering  The fifth SUNDAY in  Lent  THIS Sunday is called  PassionSunday  because as the Ritualists tell us what the  Jews  transacted on  GoodFriday  was begun on Yesterday Evening  From  John  ii  that Day it was that they took Council together to put him to Death and after this Jesus walked no more openly among the  Jews  till  PalmSunday On this Sunday therefore is very justly celebrated the Beginning of his Passion  Durand in Dom Pass Rup in Dom Pass  which follows on  GoodFriday  as a Corps after a pompous Train of Mourners  THE Collect prays that God of His Mercy would preserve our Bodies and Souls  The EPISTLE relates to our Saviour's Passion and tells us of the Benefit we have obtained  by the Shedding of his Blood How he thereby entered into the holy Place and obtained eternal Redemption for us that we might receive the Promise of eternal Inheritance  It very suitably  Rupert de Div Offic  l c  represents to us what is to come as it were at the Day of our Lord's Passion  viz  a Dereliction of the old  Jewish  Priesthood  By the Mediator himself of the new Covenant and the High Priest of a New Sacrifice  The GOSPEL says Bp  Sparrow  treats of our Lord's being slandered by the  Jews  which must needs be a Thorn in his Side and a Part of his Passion  And some of the Ritualists observe That this Gospel in it's mystical Meaning is somewhat answerable to the Epistle For when it is said  Then took they up Stones to cast at him  it is added  Then Jesus hid himself and went out of the Temple  By which is represented that  Truth is self  was hid to them because they dispised his Words and that he had now forsaken the  Jewish Temple  and was as the Epistle has it  become an High Priest of good Things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with Hands  And when our Lord says in the Gospel  which of you convinceth me of Sin  It is agreeable to that of St  Paul  in the Epistle  That Christ offered himself without Spot to God  The sixth SUNDAY in  Lent  THIS Sunday has the Name of  PalmSunday  because it was on this Day our Lord rode in Triumph to  Jerusalem  when the People took  John  xii  the Branches of  PalmTrees  and went forth to meet him and cryed  Hosanna Blessed is the King of  Israel  that cometh in the Name of the Lord  It was a Custom in the ancient Church to go in Procession on this Day bearing  Palms  in their Hands and it was also observed in our own till the  Reformation  when it was abolished because of the Superstitions attending it  THE Collect from these Words in the Epistle  Epist  Let this same Mind be in you which was in Christ JesusWho was made in the Likeness of Men and humbled himself and became obedient to Death even the Death of the Cross  prays God  Coll  Who sent our Savior Jesus Christ to take upon him our Flesh and to suffer Death upon the Cross that all Mankind should follow the Example of his great Humility  that he would mercifully grant that we may follow his Example or  Epist  be of the same Mind with him  and so partake of his  Resurrection  The EPISTLE advises to what the Collect prays for when it says  let this same Mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus  that is do ye  humble  your selves as he did and so ye may be partakers as it were the Sunday following of his Resurrection  The GOSPEL is the History of our Saviour's Passion and gives us the Particulars of what the Epistle recommends to our Imitation The  Gospel  then shews our Lord's Patience and Sufferings the  Epistle  persuades us to imitate them and the  Collect  prays for God's assistance in following his Example  THIS Week is called the  Great  the  Holy  and the  painful Week  The  Great  as being that in which were transacted the great Affairs of Man's Salvation the  Holy  as being that which was spent in the Exercise of Prayer Meditation frequenting the Church stricter Fasting then usual and greater Actions of Charity and the  painful  as being that in which our Lord underwent such exceeding Pains and Tortures for the Sins of the whole World Our Church comes as near as she can to the Devotions of the ancient Christians in this Week of Humiliation by setting apart for every Day a particular Service suitable to the Occasion  The Thursday before  Easter  THIS Day is called  MaundyThursday  from that  new Commandment  our Lord gave his Disciples to love one another On this Day he  washed  his Disciples  Feet  and therefore the second Lesson for the Morning is the History of that Transaction On this Day also he instituted the Sacrament of his  Body and Blood  and therefore the  Epistle  gives an Account of that  Institution The Gospel is very suitable being as the others the History of our Saviour's Passion  THIS  Spar Rat  Day the Penitents that were put out of the Church upon  AshWednesday  were received again into it for this Reason chiefly because on this Day our Lord was apprehended and bound which Binding wrought our Deliverance and Freedom  THE Form of reconciling Penitents was in short this The Bishop goes out to the Doors of the Church where the Penitents lie prostrate upon the Earth and thrice in the Name of Christ he calls them  Come come come ye Children hearken to me I will teach you the Fear of the Lord  Then after he had prayed for them and admonished them he reconciles them and brings them into the Church The Penitents thus received trim their Heads and Beards and laying of their penitential Weeds they recloath themselves in handsome Apparel  THE Church Doors were wont to be set open all this Day to signifie that penitent Sinners coming from  North  or  South  or any Quarter of the World shall be received to Mercy and the Churches Favour  GOODFRIDAY  THIS Day is called  Good Friday  from the Good we received o  it  viz  the Redemption of our Souls by the Death of our Lord  IT is to be observed with the strictest Fasting tho' the Passion of our Lord was the Cause of all our Joy If  Dur i Paras    it be asked why we do so when the  Saints Days  are observed as Feasts  and right dear i the Sight of the Lord is the Death of his Saints  and when the Apostle St  Paul glories in the Cros of Christ  I answer because he dy'd for our Sins as says the Prophet  Isaiah for the Transgressio of my People was he stricken  we ought therefor to be sorrowful rather than joyous and Fast ra+ther than Feast lest we be more obdurate tha  the  Rocks  themselves who  rent  at his Passion  THE Church on this Day prays God  to look upon his Family  the  Church  for which Christ dyed to receive our Prayers which we offer for all Estates of Men within it and to have Mercy upon all  Jews Turks Infidels and Hereticks  without it that they may be converted and saved  Dur Ibid  Christ prayed not only for his Friends but also for his Enemies and therefore this Day the Church in Imitation of him prays for all  The EPISTLE shews the Sacrifices under the  Jewish Law  incapable of attoning for the Sins of Men for it tells us  It is not possible that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats should take away Sins  that those were only  the Shadow of good Things to come  and did but typifie the great Sacrifice of our Saviour Christ which he offered up this Day for the Sins of the Whole World  Epist  When God had no Pleasure in burnt Offerings and Sacrifices for Sin then said he Lo I come in the Volumn of the Book it is written of me to do thy will O God  The  Rupert de Divini Offic  Lib c  GOSPEL for this Day is not only taken out of St  John  because in Order it follows the other Evangelists it not having been wrote till after he return'd from the Isle of  Patmos  where he was banished to and consequently wrote later than these of the other  Evangelists  but also because he was present at the Crucifixion whilst the other Disciples were not For as he says of himself and as St  Jerome  writeth he  being known to the High Priest  did therefore follow him with great Confidence and stood by the Cross  For  John  xix  there stood by the Cross of Jesus his Mother and his Mother's Sister and when Jesus saw his Mother and the Disciple standing whom Jesus loved he said unto his Mother Woman behold thy Son Then said he to that Disciple behold thy Mother and from that Hour that Disciple took her to his own Home  And a little after he says  v  And he that saw it bear Record and his Record is true  This Gospel is therefore taken out of St  John  rather than the others because he was an Eyewitness of the Passion  Sparrow  Which Example should teach us not to be ashamed nor afraid of the Cross of Christ  EASTEREVE  THIS Day was observed in the ancient Church as one of the strictest Fasts in the Year in Memory of our Saviour's Lying in the Grave and the Sorrow of the Apstoles  Who when the Bridegroom was taken away from them  did fast in those Days  The Church of  England  in Imitation of that advises us also to a strict Fast in private and calls us to the Place of Worship by the publick Office of the Day to imploy our selves in meditating on our Saviour's  Burial and Descent into Hell  THE Collect prays in a most moving and solemn Manner that  Rom  vi  as we are baptised into Christ's Death  so by continual mortifying our corrupt Affections  We  Rom  vi  may be buried with him  and not fear the Grave but pass joyfully thro' it to our Resurrection  The EPISTLE treats of the Descent of our Saviour's Soul into Hell that is into the Mansions of holy Souls  Where  Epist  he went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison  Where  By  Taylor  's Antiq Christ on the Resur  he communicated to them the Mysteries of the Gospel the Secrets of the Kingdom the Things hidden from eternal Ages and taught them to look up to the Glories purchased by his Passion and made the Term of their Expectation be his second Coming and the Object of their Hope the Glories of the Beatifick Vision  The GOSPEL treats of our Saviour's Body as the Epistle does of his Soul and is an Account of his  Burial  as the Gospel of Yesterday was of his  Death  It tells us also of what happened after he was interr'd and ends in such a Manner by telling us  That they went and made the Sepulchre sure sealing the Stone and setting a Watch  that we leave reading it with heavy Hearts and forced away as it were mourning from the Sepulchre  EASTERDAY  _THE Word  Easter  comes from the  Saxon  Word  Oster  which signifies to  rise  or from the Name of a Goddess which the  Saxons  worshipped at this Time of the Year called  Easter  IT is the highest of Festivals as bringing us the comfortable News of our Lord's and in due Time of our own Resurrection In the Season before the Church was in Mourning and Sorrow an Emblem of the Troubles of the present Life but now on the Day of her Saviour's Resurrection the Emblem of our future Happiness in the Kingdom of Heaven she is in the compleatest Joy Whereas therefore it was always Customary in the primitive Times to be in Sorrow for the Season of  Lent  especially in the  Holy Week  when they beheld the  Passion  and bewailed at the  Cross  and sat weeping by the  Sepulchre  it was now usual to shew Tokens of the greatest Joy and therefore their morning Salutation was  The Lord is Risen  and the Answer was  The Lord is Risen indeed  or  and  hath appeared to  Simon In Imitation of this our Church begins her Office of Praise with Salutations of the same Nature  Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the Feast  c  Christ being raised from the Dead dyeth no mo  e  c  Christ is risen from the Dead and become  c  THE Collect having acknowledged that God through his Son his conquer'd Death and set open to us the Heavens prays that the good Desires of a Joyful Resurrection which are owing to his Grace may by his continual Help be brought to good Effect  The EPISTLE directs us how to obtain what the Collect prays for when it advises us  To mortifie our Members which are upon the Earth and to set our Affections on the Things above for if we be risen with Christ we must seek those Things which are above  The GOSPEL very suitably gives us the earliest Account of his Resurrection and Mentions the first Evidences of it  EASTER  Monday  IN the primitive Times the Feast of  Easter  was solemnized even till  Whitsunday  in honour of our Lord's Resurrection afterwards the whole Week following was observed which our Church approves of by appointing a Preface in the CommunionOffice for eight Days following  tho' she hath only appointed an Epistle and Gospel for the Monday and Tuesday  The EPISTLE gives and Account of our Saviour's Resurrection from St  Peter  who tells us  That he was raised up the third Day that he was seen of them whom God had chosen Witnesses and that they eat and drank with him after his Resurrection  THIS Epistle is conveniently and judiciously placed before this Gospel as it contains the Words of  Peter  who had the Honour of seeing his Lord before  the two Disciples  or any of the Apostles  The GOSPEL is the History of what happened on the Afternoon of our Saviour's Resurrection  viz  his Walking to  Emmaus  with the  two Disciples  and his  Discovering himself to them in the Breaking of Bread  EASTER  Tuesday  THIS EPISTLE also is an Account of our Lord's Resurrection from the Mouth of  Peter  shewing as the  Epistle  Yesterday did that he was raised from the Dead  and that he was seen of them his Witnesses many Days  The GOSPEL tells us what happened in the Evening of our Lord's Resurrection how when the  Disciples  were come from  Emmaus  Jesus himself  stood in the midst of them and saith unto them Peace be unto you  The first Sunday after  Easter  THIS Sunday is called  LowSunday  because it is  Easter  repeated  Spar Rat  the  Octave  of  Easter  but the Sunday before is  HighEaster  and this a lower Feast  LowEaster  THE Collect prays for such Purity and Holiness as may intitle us to a Share in our Lord's Resurrection  The EPISTLE adviseth those  who are born of God  or Baptized into the Faith of Christ to  overcome the World  as they promised when they were Baptized  THE Reason why the Church chuses this Epistle for this Season is because it was proper for those who were Baptised on  The Ancients had only two Times of Baptizing viz the  Eves  of  Easter  and  Whitsunday  except in Cases of Necessity  Ber Augiens c  EasterEve  who came to Church every Day in  EasterWeek  with  These  Lights  were an Emblem of the Ilumination they had acquired by Baptism and the  White Vestures  otherwise called  Chrisms  were an Emblem of their inward Purity by Baptism The Vestures being laid aside this Day gives if the Name of  Dominica in albis  or  the Sunday of saying aside the White Vestures  Lights  before them and clad in white Vestures which they laid aside  this Day  in the Church that they might rise up in Judgment against them if they afterwards violated the Faith they professed in their Baptism This Epistle therefore was very suitable as putting them in Mind of what they promised  The GOSPEL is answerable to the Season and as the Sunday is  LowSunday  or  LowEaster  so it treats of our Lord's Resurrection  The second SUNDAY after  Easter  Durand in Dom Secu a Pasch  AS by the Resurrection not only the young and newly Baptized were instructed but also the Grown and the Mature This Sunday therefore treats of those who are arrived at Maturity as the Sunday before did of those who had not so far advanced It treats of the Pastors of the Church and shews them how they must follow the Example of the Lord as the other instructed the Newborn Christians how they should imitate Christ's Resurrection by Pureness and Holiness of Life  THE Collect from these Words in the Epistle  because also Christ suffered for us leaving us an Example that we should follow his Steps  having acknowledged  that God gave his only Son to be unto us both a Sacrifice for Sin and also an Example of a godly Life  prays God to send us his Grace that we may be thankful for the Benefit of his Dying for us and may also follow his Steps  THE EPISTLE shews to all the Example of our Lord's Patience and Holiness that they may follow his Steps For it tells us  that he suffered for us that he was reviled that he bore our Sins in is own Body on the Tree  and it also shews us his Manner of bearing Sufferings  he did  no Sin neither was any Guile found in his Mouth her viled not he threatned not but committed himself to him who judgeth righteously  And so he  suffered and took it patiently which was acceptable with God  The GOSPEL in a more particular Manner relates to the  Pastors and Bishops  of the Church and sets before them our blessed Lord  the good Shepherd  for their Imitation  The Epistle and it are parallel in several Places The Gospel tells us that  Jesus  is  the good Shepherd  the Epistle that he is the  Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls  The Gospel that  he layeth down his Life for his Sheep  The Epistle  that he bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree  The Gospel shews the Master foretelling  that he hath other Sheep which are not of this Fold and that them also he wou'd bring and they should hear his Voice and they should be one Fold and one Shepherd  The Epistle shews the Servants fulfilling the Prophecy of their Lord when it says  Ye were as Sheep going astray but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your Souls  The third SUNDAY after  Easter  IT is observable that the Collect and Epistle of this Day have a particular View to Baptism which was undoubtedly to remind the newly baptized at  Easter  what Obligations they lay under to perform their Duty  Sparr Rat Microl c    THE Ancients were wont to observe an Anniversary in Commemoration of their Baptism which was called  Pascha Annotinum  They that were baptized at  Easter  the Year before came the Year following the same Day to Church and solemnly with Oblations and other Religious Offices commemorated the Anniversary Day of their  NewBirth  Tho' our Church does not in every particular observe the same Custom yet she draws near to the ancient Practice in this solemn tho' general Anniversary Commemoration of Baptism this Day minding us all this Day of our Baptism and our Vow made therein and praying to God to enable us all to keep it  THE Collect is very suitable to this Commemoration of the Church and prays God wh  enlightens by Baptism  that all those who ha  been admitted into the Fellowship of Christ's Religion  or baptized into the Faith of Christ may perform the Promises and Vows made in their Baptism  The EPISTLE is also very suitable and persuades the  NewBorn  or those whom God hath brought  Coll  from Error to the Light of his Truth  to walk as Childeren of Light and to live up to what they vowed in their Baptism  Epist  by abstaining from  the Lusts of the Flesh and having an honest Conversation among the Gentiles  The GOSPEL is answerable to the Season  of our Lord's Being in the World after his Resurrection till the Ascension  A little while and ye shall not see me  is to say in a little while I shall be laid in my Grave and so be taken from your Eyes  and again a little while and ye shall see me  is to say you shall see me again for a little while after my Resurrection  A little while and ye shall weep and lament  for my Death but after my Resurrection  your Sorrow shall be turn'd into Joy  This Gospel therefore should represent to us the Joyfulness of this Time by the Joy the Apostles had after our Lord was risen  The fourth SUNDAY after  Easter  THE Collect considering that the Epistle says  every good and every perfect Gift cometh down from above  c and therefore that whatsoever good we do is owing to the Gifts  and Will  of God  Epist  who of his own Will begat the Apostles with the Word of Truth that they might be a Kind of FirstFruits of his Creatures  acknowledges God to be  Almighty  and  that he alone can order the unruly Wills and Affections of sinful Men  and then it prays that he would Grant the like unto his People that they loving the Things which he commands and desiring that which he does promise may have their Hearts fixed upon such heavenly Objects as redound to them from Christ's Resurrection and the Holy Ghost the promised Comforter  The EPISTLE telling us that  every good and perfect Gift cometh  own from the Father of  Lights  does thereby teach us that the  HolySpirit  and his blessed Fruits are the Gifts of God and  cometh down  from him And as it tells us that  God of his own Will begat the Apostles with the Word of Truth c  so it confirms the Promise of Christ to his Apostles in this Day's Gospel viz  Gosp  when the Spirit of Truth was come he should Guide them into all Truth  This Epistle therefore is very suitable to this Season in which we read the Promise of the Comforter  The GOSPEL also is very suitable to this Season of our Lord's  Going in and out for forty Days  among his Disciples In the Gospel before he tells them of his Being with them  a little while  in the present Gospel he tells them he must shortly go away to sent unto them  the Spirit of Truth to guide them into all Truth  The fifth SUNDAY after  Easter  THIS Sunday has the Name of  Rogation Sunday  and is so called because of the  Three Days  following it being set apart by the Church as Days of Abstinence and putting up of  Rogations and Litanies  which are Requests and Supplications to God  THE Reason of this Exercise at this Time is that our Hearts and Minds may be the better prepared to  Ascend with Christ  the  Thursday  following and that the Fruits of the Earth which at this Time are young and tender may avoid being hurt that God would avert his Judgments  from them and let us enjoy them in due Season  THE Collect observing in the Gospel that  Whatsoever we ask the Father in Christ's Name we shall receive  acknowledges that  it is God from whom all good Things  come and then prays that he would send his Holy Ghost into our Hearts that by  his Holy Inspiration  we may be purified with good Thoughts and obtain Strength and Power to bring them to good Effect  The EPISTLE teaches us how we may obtain the  Comforter  the Collect prays for  viz by being Doers of the World and not Hearers  only For they who hear the Word only are like the  Seed  which fell upon the  Wayside  on the Rock and among the  Thorns  which were  trodden down withered away  and  choaked But  Epist  the Doers of the  Word  are  Sexag  Sun  they which hear the Word of God and keep it  are the  Seed  which fell on good Ground which brings  forth Fruit with Patience  And therefore  Epist  not a forgetful Hearer but a Doer of the Work shall be blessed in his Deed  or shall obtain the promised Comforter  The GOSPEL before acquaints us with our Lord's Leaving the World and sending to us the  Comforter  The present Gospel shews us how we may obtain him  ask and ye shall receive that your Joy may be full  This is therefore very suitable for the Sunday before the Ascension as it assures us that our Lord did not ascend till he had promised us a Comforter in his Stead and shewed us the Way of obtaining the Promise  The  Spar Rat  GOSPEL is concerning  Rogations  teaching us how to ask of God so as we may obtain and withal foretells his approaching Ascension  THE  Fast  this Week is voluntary for there is no Fast commanded betwixt Easter and Whitsunday all that Time being spent in Joy on Account of the Lord's Resurrection  ASCENSIONDAY  THE Church having celebrated the Resurrection of her Saviour doth in a regular Course of Things come to his Ascension She shews him telling hid Disciples how he would be in the World  a little while  then talking of his  Going away  then sending to us the  Comforter  and lastly shewing us the Way and Method of obtaining him And having thus celebrated these Things in her Gospels for each Sunday she now celebrates the Day of his Ascension after all when he visibly ascended into the Heavens with his Humane Nature after he had been with his Disciples forty Days upon Earth  THE Collect prays that God would send us Grace to imitate as much as we are able the Ascension of our Saviour that as he really ascended in his Humane Nature so we may also ascend in our Hearts and Minds and dwell continually with him there  The EPISTLE gives us a particular Account  of our Lord's Ascension in the Presence of his Disciples how after he had been with them forty Days he assembled them together and having assured them he would send them the Comforter he ascended into Heaven  The GOSPEL also is the History of our  Lord's Ascension  and tells us in a particular Manner how he ascended into the Heavens and when he came there that  he sat down at the Right Hand of God  The SUNDAY after  AscensionDay  THIS Week has the Name of  ExpectationWeek  because now the Apostles  expected  the fulfilling of our Saviour's Promise of the Comforter  If I go away I will send the Comforter to you  THE Collect is very suitable to the Season and in Imitation of the Condition the Apostles were in at this Time prays as the Apostles may be supposed to have done that God  would not leave us comfortless  but send to us  the Holy Ghost to comfort us and exalt us into the same Place whither our Saviour Christ is gone before  The EPISTLE considering what the Collect prays for  viz  that we may obtain the  Comforter and be exalted into the Heavens  shews us the Way of obtaining both the one and the other  If we be sober and watch unto Prayer  as it advises us following the Examples of the Apostles  at this Time  Gosp  The Comforter will come unto us  according to what our Lord himself tells us as it were a little before his  Ascension ask and ye shall receive  Durand in Dominic p  st Ascens  and by  good Works by Charity and Mercy  which it also exhorts us to we may fly after our Saviour into the Heavens as it were from  the Mount of Olives  The GOSPEL is the Promise of the Comforter which the Epistle exhorts to pray for and which therefore our Church does pray for in this Day's Collect It is suitable to this Time as it is the Promise of the  Comforter  the  Apostles  were now  expecting  WHITSUNDAY  THIS Day is called  Whitsunday  because of that  Light  the Apostles were illuminated with by the Descent of the Holy Ghost But it is chiefly so called because the new baptized were wont at this Time to be cloathed with  White Garments  It has the Name of Pentecost because there are Fifty Days between  Easter  and  Whitsunday  as it was Fifty Days between the  Passover  and the Jewish Pentecost Among the  Jews  it was celebrated because the Law was then given on  Mount Sinai  and among the  Christians  because on this Day the Holy Ghost was given to the Church  The last Sunday the Church being as it were in  Expectation  of the Coming of the Comforter prayed in the  Collect  that God would send him but now the Comforter being come she prays in this Day's Collect that God would send  her a true Judgment in all Things and everlasting Joy in the Comfort of that Holy Spirit  The EPISTLE is the Relation of the Wonderful Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles on this Day of  Pentecost when he sat upon Each of them  in the Shape of  Cloven Tongues  like as of Fire and gifted them with speaking in all Languages  the wonderful Works of God  The GOSPEL is very suitable for the Festival as being our Saviour's Promise of the Comforter which the Epistle tells us he sent down on his Church on this Day  MONDAY in  WhitsunWeek  THE Collect is the same with that of Yesterday it having been always Customary in the Week following any  great Festival  to repeat some part of its Office  THIS Week is not celebrated quite through in a Festival Manner as was the Week of  Easter  the former Part of it is only  Festival  the latter Part is  East  The former is  Festival  because of the  Descent of the  Holy Ghost and because also the Church at this  Hugh de Sanct Vic in V  g  l pe  ec  Season performed the Office of Baptism to Converts But the later was spent in  Fasting  because of the  EmberDays  the  Wednesday Friday  and  Saturday  following which were always observed a Fast in Conformity to the Apostles fasting before Ordination  Act  xiii  AS then the Church at this Season not only celebrates the Descent of the Holy Ghost but likewise performed the Solemn Acts of  Baptism  and  Ordination  and also  Confirmation  at this Season so in her Offices for the Days attending this great Festival she solemnizes the Feast and Commemorates the Church's Practice  The EPISTLE mentions the Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the  Gentiles  as  Peter  was preaching to them and at the Close it mentions Baptism telling us how the Gentiles were  Baptized in the Name  of the Lord The Epistle therefore is very agreeable to the Season in which we commemorate both the Descent of the  Holy Spirit  and the Custom of the Church of Baptizing at this Season And therefore it lays before the  Newly Baptized  the Necessity of  walking as Children of Light  and believing in Christ  For he that believeth shall not perish but hath everlasting Life but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God  TUESDAY in  WhitsunWeek  THE Epistle suitable to the Custom of  Baptizing  at this Season and of  Confirming  which was also now used is concerning Baptism  and Confirmation and is also very proper for the Practice of the Church at the latter Part of the Week the Time of fasting and praying for an holy and regular Ministry It tells us therefore that  when the Apostles had heard that  Samaria  had received the Word of God they sent to them  Peter  and  John  who when they had laid their Hands on them they received the Holy Ghost Philip  had  Baptized  them but being only in the Inferior Orders he could not give them  Confirmation  which was the Province of  Peter  and  John  they being Bishop or of the Highest Order We may see therefore how agreeable this is to the Custom of  Ordaining  at this Time For it teaches us that there is a Difference of Orders because there is a Difference of Power  Philip  could  baptize  but he could not  confirm  which shews that the Power of  Ordaining  being at least equally great with that of  Confirming  can be lodged no where but in the Bishop or the highest Order This Epistle then mentions  Baptism  the Descent of the  Holy Ghost Confirmation  and lastly inferrs the Validity of an  Episcopal Ordination  which is going to be performed at this Time and so is highly suitable to the Season  The GOSPEL answerable to he  EmberWeek  and the Ordination shews which are the lawfully appointed Ministers of God which are not which are the  Shepherds  of the Sheep which are the  Thieves and Robbers  Those who enter not into the Sheepfold by Christ who is the  Door  and consequently by those whom Christ sent  as he himself was sent  but  climbeth up some other Way  are the  Thieves  and  Robbers  Trinity  SUNDAY  _THIS is called  TrinitySunday  because on it is celebrated the Festival of the  Holy Trinity  It is celebrated at this Time as coming in at the Close of the Festivals which have been dedicated to the several Persons of the Godhead  Duran in Dom San Tr  On the  Nativity  is celebrated the Festival of the  Father  for the  Nativity  is called the Festival of the  Father  On  Easterday  the Festival of the Son and on  Whitsunday  the Festival of the  Holy Ghost  and therefore very fitly on this Day in celebrated the Feast of the  Trinity  to shew that those three Persons are  one God  For as the Church by observing these Days separate to the Persons in the  Ever Blesse Trinity  shews her Faith in the  Unity in Trinity  so by the Observation of this in particular she shews her Faith in the Trinity in Unity Another Reason for observing this particular Time for the Celebration of this Festival is because the Lord had no sooner ascended into Heaven and the Holy Ghost descended upon the Church than the Knowledge of the most glorious Trinity became more conspicuous than ever it was before  THE  The Collects of the Book of  Common Prayer  may arm us with a Compendious Ejaculatory Prayer of the Church's Composure pertinent to all Occasions which may be of excellent Use to those who desire to be always on their Guard against the Enemy of their Souls Thus on the third Sunday after  Easter  we pray for  Sincerity  On AshWednesday for  Contrition  On this Day for a right and firm Faith c Dr  Comber  Bishop  Fox  the Founder of  Corpus Christi  College in  Oxford  obliges all his Fellows to repeat this Day's Collect every Morning and Evening of their whole Life as a Necessary Part of their private Devotions  Ex M S Dr Ellison  Collect prays to God that he would keep his Servants in the stedfast Confession of the True Faith  the Unity in Trinity and Trinity in Unity  THIS Sunday in the ancient Church having been the last of the Days of  Baptism  at this Season of  Pentecost  the  Rupert de Offic Sanct Trinit  Epistle has Relation to Baptism particularly in that Part of it  and before the Throne there was a Sea of Glass like to Christal  which the Ritualist says signifies the Baptism of a pure Confession and a solid Faith But however it is still very fit for the Season as having in it that angelical Hymn  Holy Holy Holy Lord God Almighty  which is it self a Proof of the Trinity in Unity  The GOSPEL also suitable to the Custom of Baptizing at this Season of  Pentecost  treats of Baptism and shews the great Necessity of it  Verily verily I say unto you except a Man be born of Water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God  which is exactly answerable to the Epistle and is as much as to say that we must sail through the  Sea of Glass  there mentioned  before we arrive at the Port of Happiness or  enter into the Kindom of God  mentioned in the Gospel But however tho' it answers the Epistle so exactly in the Custom of the Church of Baptizing at this Season yet it is still very proper for this Festival of the Blessed Trinity For the Three Persons of the Godhead are mentioned in it in whose Names the whole Church is baptized  The first Sunday after  Trinity  THE whole Time from  Advent  to  TrinitySunday  having been chiefly spent in Commemorating the most remarkable Transactions of our Saviour's Life and Death the Offices appointed by the Church were always answerable to the Occasion And having celebrated the Mysteries of our Redemption and proposed to our Imitation the Example of our Lord she comes now in the Offices from  Trinity Sunday  to  Advent  to instruct us in our Duty that we may follow rightly the Example which has been given us The Epistles and Gospels therefore of the following Sundays are instructive of an Holy Life teaching us the Road of Virtue and how we may avoid the Byways of Vice And tho' they are not suited to the Sundays they were fixed to as the others before TrinitySunday are to their respective Seasons that being impracticable yet the Office for each Sunday has generally an agreeable Harmony and Fitness in itself the Collect Epistle and Gospel having  for the most Part some Likeness and Analogy to one another  THE Collect considering from a View of the  rich Man's  uncharitable Behaviour in the Gospel  Coll  The Weakness of our mortal Nature  and therefore how of our selves  Coll  we are able to do no good Thing  prays God that he would  grant us the Help of his Grace that  Coll  we may keep his Commandments or the Commandment of loving our Brother  mentioned in the Epistle which will enable us  to  Coll  please God both in Will and Deed  The EPISTLE tell us  how God sent his Son into the World that he was the Propitiation for our Sins  and how after that  he gave us of his Spirit  by which is mentioned in short the great Acts of our Redemptions  viz  our Saviour's Brith and Death and the Coming of the Holy Ghost which by the Way is very suitable for the first Sunday after  Trinity  From those Acts of Love and Mercy it exhorts to Charity which the  Rich Man  in the Gospel wanted For the Apostle argues  if God so loved us we ought also to love one another And that we cannot love God but we must love our Brother also  That it is not enough to be holy in our Desires and Thoughts that we may  Coll  please God in Will  but we must also be charitable to our Brethren  Coll  that we may please him in Deed  The GOSPEL is the Parable of  Dives  and  Lazarus  which tells us the Fate of the unmerciful and uncharitable and which therefore both deters us from  that Hatred  and excites us to  that Love of our Brethren  mentioned in the Epistle For whoever would avoid being in  Hell and in Torments  as  Dives  was must not only not  Epist  hate but Love his Brother also  The Collect then prays that we may be able  to do Good  or Deeds of Charity the Epistle excites us to this great Duty by shewing us the Love of God towards us and the Gospel threatens us with the Flames of Hell and everlasting Death if we do it not  The second SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect as it were from these Words in the Epistle  and whatever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments  c having acknowledged  that God never fails to help and govern those whom he brings up in his stedfast Fear and Love  beseeches him  to keep us under the Protection of his good Providence  that we  may have a perpetual Fear and Love of his Holy Name  that by the Former we may not dare to excuse our selves from  the great Supper  mentioned in the Gospel and may by the Latter have Grace readily to accept of the Invitation  The EPISTLE excites us to Actions of Charity and Love to each other and to the Love of God and therefore advises us out of the Abundance and Affluence of Things God hath bestowed on us to be merciful to our poor and  indigent Brethren in Imitation as it were of the Man in the Gospel who brought into his  Supper the Poor and the Maimed and the Halt and the Blind For whos  hath this World's Good and seeth his Brother have need and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion from him how dwelleth the Love of God in him  It therefore Advises us not to love our Brethren in  Word  neither in  Tongue  as those loved God who excused themselves from the  great Supper  but to  love them in Deed and in Truth  as God loved those he invited to it  The GOSPEL is the Parable of the great Supper in which is represented the wonderful Love of God to his indigent Creatures in inviting them to the good Things of his heavenly Kingdom and the Ingratitude of the Sons of Men in not accepting of them  The third SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect considering that the Epistle and Gospel shew that we are exposed to many and great Dangers prays that  we may be defended and comforted in all Dangers and Adversities  The EPISTLE mentions what those Dangers are and shews what is requisite to support us under them It tells us the Dangers are the Devil and his Angels who walk about seeking whom they may devour and that  by being humble sober and vigilant and by casting all our Care upon God who careth for us  we may be able  to resist them  The GOSPEL also under the Parable of  lost Sheep  shews us the Dangers we are exposed to and that  God careth for us  when we are in them When the Devil who is the roaring Lion in the Wilderness of this World finds one of the Sheep of Christ wandering and straying from the Flock and not using that Vigilance the Epistle advises him to he immediately seizes him that  he may devour him  But  Jesus Christ the good Shepherd who careth for his Sheep goes after that which is lost untill he finds it  and then  Sam  i  delivers him out of the Jaws of the Lion  and brings him back to the Fold  The fourth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect seems from a View of the  blind Guides  mentioned in the Gospel to acknowledge  God the Protector of all that trust in him and to be him without whom nothing is strong nothing is holy  and then considering  the Sufferings of this present World  mentioned in the Epistle and the Danger of meeting with the  blind Guides  in the Gospel to carry us through them it prays God  Gosp  Our Father which is merciful  Epist  that he would increase and multiply upon us his Mercy  that instead of the  Guides  in the Gospel  Coll  He would be our Ruler and Guide  that we  Coll  may so pass through Things temporal that we finally lose not the Things eternal  or as the Epistle has it  That we may pass through the Sufferings of this prefent World to the Glory which shall be revealed  The EPISTLE mentions the  Sufferings of the World  and tells us  That the whole Creation nay even those who had the first Fruits of the Spirit groan and travel in Pain together waiting for the Manifestation of the Sons of God and the Redemption of the Body  The GOSPEL shews us the Way of obtaining what the Collect prays for If we would have God multiply upon us his Mercy we must be merciful as he is merciful we must not judge nor condemn but we must forgive and we must be charitable And if we would have him to be  Coll  our Ruler and Guide in passing through Things temporal  we must guard against  BlindGuides  who are Leaders of  the Blind  who together with those they  lead fall both into the Ditch  and  Coll  so  finally lose the Things eternal  The fifth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect is founded upon the  Epistle and Gospel  and begs of God the Peace of the World  that the Church may serve him in joy and godly Quietness  The EPITLE shews the Method of acquiring what the Collect prays for  Epist  If we be all of one Mind  as were  the Partners  in the Gospel if as they did we  Epist  love as Brethren  and are ready  Gosp  to come and help  each other  if  Epist  we be pitiful and Courtous c  Coll  we shall keep the Church in godly Quietness  But  Epist  if we render Evil for Evil or Railing for Railing  we shall occasion Schisms and Divisions and put the Church into Disorder and Confusion  The GOSPEL is the Miracle of the  Draught of Fishes  when the Lord entered into  Simon  's Ship Tho'  they had toiled all the Night and had taken nothing yet at his Word they let down the Net and when they had this done they inclosed a great Multitude of Fishes and their Net brake  Beda Dom    post Trin Corn a Lapid in Lor  By the  Ship  is represented to us the  Catholick Church  by the  Net  the  Catholick Faith  and by the  Multitude of Fishes  the vast Numbers of Converts the Apostles should bring over to the Christian Religion when they became  Fishers of Men  So that by the  Nets  breaking with the  Multitude  of Fishes is represented to us how the Faith of the Church is rent and torn by Heresies and Schisms which the Epistle cautions us and the Collect prays against  The sixth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect prays for the love of God  that by loving him above all Things we may obtain his Promises which exceed all that we can desire  The EPISTLE tells us what these  Promises  are and how we may acquire them It assures us  we shall be planted into the Likeness of Christ's Resurection and that we shall live with him  provided  that we walk in Newness of Life and have destroyed the Body of Sin  The GOSPEL also excites us to  Newness of Life  by commanding us not so much to regard what  was said by them of old Time  as what our Saviour  says unto us  And as the Epistle tells us  That our old Man is crucified with Christ  so the Gospel tells us  That our Righteousness must exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees  or else  we  shall not enter into  the Kingdom of Heaven or obtain the Promises which exceed all that can be desired  The seventh SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect having acknowledged God from a View of the Miracle in the Gospel  to be the Lord of all Power and Might  and from our Saviour's Compassion to the hungry Multitude  to be the Giver of all good Things  prays God that he would  graft in our Hearts the Love of his Name increase in us true Religion nourish us with all Goodness and of his great Mercy keep us in the same  The EPISTLE persuades us to what the Collect prays for and advices that we should turn from being  the Servants of Sin  to be the  Servants of Righteousness  that we may avoid  the Wages of Sin which is Death  and obtain  the Gift of God  which is  eternal Life through Jesus Christ our Lord  The GOSPEL is the Miracle of our Saviour's Feeding the four Thousand with  seven Loaves  and a  few small Fishes  Where we may observe  upon what Bottom the Church in this Day's Collect puts up her Petitions By the staying of the People so long and their eager Desire for the Doctrine of Christ she prays  for the Love of God and the Increase of true Religion  and from the Refreshment of the  Loaves  she prays that we may  be nourished with all Goodness  The Ritualists tell us that those of the People who came  from far  are a Representation of those  who hunger and thirst after Righteousness  which they have so long fasted from and that therefore the Epistle answers exactly in saying  When ye were the Servants of Sin ye were freed from Righteousness  Boys  in th Sunday after  Trinity  CHRIST's miraculous Feeding of many People with a  few Loaves  is read in the Church every Year thrice to wit in  Winter  when  Wheat  is sown in  Lent  when it is in hopeful Spring and in Harvest when it is ready for the Barn The Reason hereof is manifold  First that in sowing seeing and reaping our Corn we might not ascribe this wonderful Increase to the Fatness of our Land or Greatness of our Skill or Goodness of our Seed but only to the Blessing of God  Ps  clxxv  Opening his Hand and filling all Things living with Plentiousness  Who doth every Year make a great Harvest of a few Grains as he did here make a great Feast of a few Loaves  dly That we may be well assured of Christ's Bounty towards all his Followers  hungring and thirsting after Righteousness  providing for them abundantly least they faint in their Way    Pet  v  Caring for such as cast their Care upon him  as he promised in his Gospel  First seek the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness and then all other Things shall be  ministred unto you  dly That we may learn to use these temporal Blessings in Thanksgivings to God in Hospitality towards the Poor  feeding such as have nothing to eat  in Frugality  taking up the Broken  Meat not suffering any of God's good Creatures unprofitably to be spoiled or wastfully to be cast away  The eighth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect prays that God  would put away from us all hurtful Things and give us such Things as are profitable to our Salvation  The EPISTLE shews what is  hurtful and  what is  Profitable  That it is  hurtful to live after the Flesh  and  profitable through the Spirit to mortify the Deeds of the Body because if we live after the Flesh we shall die but if through the Spirit we mortify the Deeds of the Body we shall live  The GOSPEL is careful that we be not drawn away *  to live after the Flesh by False Prophets  Epist  It therefore bids us beware of them and then tells us how we may know them in Disguise  You shall know them by  their Fruits  that is you shall find that they  Epist  live  inwardly after the Flesh tho' outwardly by a seeming  Continence Chastity  and  Fasting  they appear to  Epist  mortify the Deeds of the Body  And then agreeable to the Epistle which says  that they which live after the Flesh shall die  it also deters from such a Life and Conversation by mentioning the Punishment due  viz  that  they shall be cast into the Fire  The ninth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect considering the Fate of the  Israelites  in the Epistle and how we are there advised to  take heed lest we also fall  Epist  and how the  Steward  in the Gospel was turned out of his  Stewardship  for unjustly managing the Things he was intrusted with prays God that he would send us  Coll  his Spirit to do always such Things as be rightful that we who cannot do any Thing that is Good without him  more than could the  Israelites  in the Epistle  when they fell from their own Steadfastness  or the  Steward  in the Gospel when he became Unjust  may by him be enabled to live according to his Will  The EPISTLE shews the Necessity of our being assisted by God's Spirit  Coll  to do always such Things as he rightful  The  Israelites  had obtained many Blessings and tasted of the  Coll  good Things of God  but when they  Epist  lusted after evil Things  became Idolaters Fornicators  c  and God's Spirit forsook them  they were overthrown in the Wilderness wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall  The GOSPEL also teaches us that the  Spirit of God  is always necessary to keep us in  Coll  doing these Things that be rightful  Whilst the Steward walked in  the Spirit  he was Faithful to his Lord but when he ceased to be so guided he became unjust The Gospel in this Parable runs parallel to the Epistle The  rich Man who had a Steward  is no other than  God  who is rich in Goodness towards all and who committed his Blessings to the  Israelites  in the Epistle as he did his Goods to the  Steward  in the Gospel As the  Israelites  in the Epistle abused his great Goodness to them so the  Steward wasted his Goods  and as the  Israelites  were therefore  overthrown in the Wilderness  so was the  Steward  put out of his  Stewardship  The tenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect having as it were before its Eyes the  Gifts  mentioned in the Epistle some of which will always be necessary for the Church prays God  Epist  Who worketh all in all and divideth to every Man severally as he will  that  Coll  we may ask such Things or Gifts as will please him  or be according to his  Will which worketh all in all  The EPISTLE is chosen from a View of the Gospel As the Gospel mentions our Saviour's weeping over the City  Jerusalem  and lamenting  that the Things belonging to her Peace were hidden from her Eyes  so the Epistle instructs us as to  Spiritual Gifts  and tells us that  whoever calleth Jesus accursed  or opposeth Christ and his Religion  doth not speak by the Spirit of God  and that  no Man can say that Jesus is Lord  or the  Messiah  but by the Holy Ghost and that all Manner of  Gifts  whatever are from the  same Spirit  The GOSPEL is the Story of our Saviour's Weeping over the  City Jerusalem  The Epistle is parallel to it in several Places The Gospel tells us  that the Jews knew not the Things which belonged to their Peace the Epistle therefore concerning Spiritual Gifts would not have us Ignorant  as they were the Gospel shews that our Lord the Messiah of the World  was hidden from their Eyes  the Epistle shews that they wanted the  Holy Ghost  because they were the Persons who  called Jesus accursed  and who would not say that  Jesus is the Lord  SOME of the  Ritualists  observe that be our Lord's  Casting them out that bought and sold in the Temple  is represented that the Lord will throw those out of the Church who are  Buyers and Sellers  of Holy Orders And therefore the Epistle very suitably tells us before that  Spiritual Gifts  cannot be given much less sold by Man but they are the  Gifts of the Holy Ghost who divideth to every Man severally as he will  This Gospel is read at this Season because in the Month of  August  the  Temple  was burnt and in  September  the whole  City  was set on Fire and so was our Lord's Prediction of it fulfilled  The eleventh SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect as it were from the Mouth of the  Publican  in the Gospel  God be merciful to me a Sinner  and from the Apostle in the Epistle  Acts  who obtained Mercy through the  Epist  Grace of God  acknowledges God  to be a God of Mercy and Piety  and prays that God would  mercifully grant unto us his Grace  as he did the Apostle in the Epistle  that we may run the Way of his Commandments and be made Partakers of his heavenly Treasure  The EPISTLE gives us the Apostle St  Paul  for an Example of that Humility which is recommended in the Gospel  For  says he  I am the least of the Apostles that am not meet to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the Church of God  Observe how answerable this is to the  Publican  in the Gospel the  Publican  stands afar of and dare not so much  as lift up his Eyes to Heaven  The Apostle with the same humble Mind says  I am the least of the Apostles  c T  Publican  confesses that he's  a Sinner  the  Apostle that he persecuted the Church of God  The GOSPEL in the Parable of the  Pharisee  and the  Publican  shews that  they which exalt themselves shall be abased and they that humble  themselves shall be exalted  The boasting  Pharisee  is an Instance of the Former and the humble  Publican  is of the Latter The  Publican  boasts not with the  Pharisee that he is not as other Men are Extortioners unjust  c  but he stands afar of and dare not so much as list up his Eyes to Heaven  and with a deep Sense of his Guilt he  smites upon his Breast  saying  God be merciful to me a Sinner  And therefore  he went down to his House justified rather than the Other  The twelfth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect considering our Saviour's Goodness in giving the Man in the Gospel  Speech  instead of  Dumbness  and  Hearing  instead of  Deafness  prays for such  abundant Mercy  that we may be  forgiven those Things whereof our Conscience is afraid and given these good Things which we are not worthy to ask but through the Merits and Mediation of our Saviour  The EPISTLE seems to have been chosen as suitable to the Gospel because the Gospel in its mystical Meaning shews that the Priests of the  new Testament  should bring over to Christ's Doctrine the Unbelievers of the World It therefore shews that God made the Apostles and their Successors  able Ministers of the new Testament  and that  the Ministration of Death  or the Ministry of the Law was inferiour to the  Ministration of the Spirit  or the Ministry of the Gospel For in the Times of  the Former it was only prophecy'd  that  Isaiah Ch  XXXV  the Ears of the Deaf should be opened and the Tongue of the Dumb should sing  but under the Latter we see the Prophecy compleated  The GOSPEL is the History of our Lord's Curing the  Deaf and Dumb  under which is couched a  Luth in Domin    Trin  mystical Meaning By the  Deaf and Dumb  is to be understood those who hear not the Commands of God nor speak forth his Praise And those who bring them to Christ  and beseech him to put his Hand upon them  are an Emblem of the Preachers of the Gospel who by the Charge of the Ministry committed to them bring such  Dumb and Deaf  to Christ and to a Knowledge of their Duty  The thirteenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect observing that both the Epistle and Gospel shew that Salvation is by the  free Promise  of God and not by the  Jewish Law  acknowledges  that of God's only Gift it cometh that we do unto him true and laudable Service  and then from these Words in the Gospel  this do and thou shalt live  it prays God  that we may so faithfully serve him in this Life that we fail not finally to attain his heavenly Promises  The EPISTLE treats of the  Promise God made to  Abraham  and his Seed  which was  in thee shall all Nations be blessed  This was Promised  not to many Seeds but to his only  which Seed is Christ  It therefore tells us that the Right of Inheritance was by that  free Promise  and not by the Observation of the  Jewish Law  Epist  For if there had been a Law given which could have given Life verily Righteousness should have been by the Law But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin that the Promise by Faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe  Those then only are saved who believe in  Jesus Christ  and there is no Salvation by the Jewish Law  The GOSPEL shews us this  Seed  viz  Christ  in whom all the  Nations of the World are blessed  verifying the  Promise  and saying  blessed are the Eyes which see the Things that ye see c  and by the following Parable most beautifully Points out to us that  Salvation  and the  Blessing promised  is not by the  Jewish Law  but by  Jesus Christ the promised Seed  By  Theophy in Loc Bed in Dom    post Trin  the  Man who went down from  Jerusalem  to  Jericho  who fell among Thieves c  is to be understood the Sons of  Adam  stript naked of their Innocence and left almost dead in their Sins By the  Priest  and  Levite passing by on the other Side  we have an Emblem of the Weakness of the  Jewish  Law in taking away Sins For as the Epistle infers  it was not a Law that could give Life  See the Epistle for  GoodFryday  For it is not possible that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats should take away Sins  By the Good  Samaritan  is to be understood our blessed Lord who according to the Promise repaired our lost Innocency and bound up the Wounds of our Sins  The fourteenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect having as it were in view the  Faith  of the  Samaritan Leper  the  Hope  and Confidence of the  Ten when they listed up their Voices  and the  Charity  of our Lord in healing them prays for the Increase  of Faith Hope and Charity  and probably from their being  cleansed as they were going to the Priest  as Christ  commanded them  It also prays  and that we may obtain that which thou dost promise make us to love that which thou dost command  The EPISTLE is answerable to the Gospel For as the Gospel gives us the History of  the ten Lepers  whose Disease is an Emblem of Sin the Leprosie of the Soul so the Epistle mentions the Substance of which the Leprosie of the Ten was but the Shadow  For the Works of the Flesh  says it  are Adultery Fornication Uncleannses Lasciviousness  c And as the Gospel tells us how the Leprosie of the Body was healed so the Epistle tells us how we may cure the Leprosie of the Soul  I say then walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh  c  The GOSPEL is the History of the  Ten Lepers  As our Lord was going to  Jerusalem  they met him and prayed him to cure them of their Leprosie Upon which he told them  to go shew themselves unto the Priests and it came to pass that as they were going they were cleansed  For  Levit  iv  it was commanded that whoever was cured of the Leprosie should go shew himself to the  Priest that he might make the Offering which the Law required and so be pronounced clean of the Leprosie  NOW under this is couched that when we are tainted with the Leprosie of Sin we should go to those who are the Judges of the Uncleanness of the Soul the Successors of those who judged of the Leprosie of the Body  Bp▪  Hall  Whether an Act be sinfull or in what Degree it is such What Grounds are sufficient for the comfortable Assurance of Repentance of Forgiveness What Courses are fittest to avoid the Danger of Relapses Who is so like to know so meet to judge as our Teachers who are the Cleansers of the spiritual Leprosie under their Master Christ  For they take away Sins by the Power and Authority he endowed them with not that they do that of themselves but through their Lord and Master who cleansed the Lepers as  they went on their Way to the Priests  and who really    John  i  cleanseth us from all Sin  Agreeable to that in the Epistle that they  who are Christ's or who walk in his Spirit have crucified the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts  The fifteenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect as it were from a View of the  FalseBrethren  in the Epistle prays for the Preservation of the Church and considering their  Failing  it acknowledges the  Frailty of Man  without God's Assistance And then from a  deep Sense of the great Danger of too much desiring those  Gosp  Things which the  Gentiles  seek after  and the great Necessity  of  Gosp  seeking first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness  it prays God  to keep us from all Things hurtful and lead us to all Things profitable to our Salvation  The EPISTLE by giving us an Account of the Behaviour of those mentioned in it shews plainly  what is hurtful and what is profitable to our Salvation  It tells of some  who desired to make a fair Shew in the Flesh by constraining others to be circumcised  And this  they did that they might not suffer Persecution for the Sake  of  The Emperors  Caius Octavian  and  Tiberius  had given Liberty to the  Jews  to live according to their own Law without Molestation or Disturbance throughout all the  Roman  Empire So that if a  Jew  turned Christian he had the Privileges of a  Jew  so long as he kept the ceremonial Rites of  Moses  Whereas they who taught that Ceremonies were abrogated and that Men were justified only by Faith in Christ wanted those Priledges and were persecuted by the  Jews  and  Gentiles Boys  n Lo    Christ by which Words the Apostle cautions his  Galatians  against the Practises of those Christians who out of the Fear of being  persecuted for the Cross  and of not carrying on their worldly Affairs observed the Rites of the  Jewish  Law and taught that Circumcision was necessary So then being so anxious after the Things of this Life as to neglect or slight the Things of the other are  the hurtful Things  here  spoken of  and no doubt if we become newCreatures as the Epistle advises we shall possess  those Things which are profitable to our Salvation  The GOSPEL shew  that no Man can serve two Masters  which speakes the Impossibility of those mentioned in the Epistle pleasing both the Christian and the Jew God and the World It was their Practice to preach to the Jews the Doctrine of the Circumcision that they might avoid Persecution and enjoy in Ease the Things of the World and the Doctrine of the Cross to the Christians imagining that that was Sufficient to save them But this Gospel thews the Weakness and Folly of such Pretences For it assures us  we cannot serve God and Mammon  Would we therefore avoid being the  Servants of Sin We must take no Thought what we shall eat or what we shall drink or wherewith all we shall be cloathed  lest with the too anxious People in the Epistle we become  Gosp  Haters  of God but if we would be  Gosp  Lovers of God as St  Paul  strives to make his  Galations  we must  seek first of all the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness  or first of all put on the NewMan and become a  Epist  NewCreature  The sixteenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect from the Example of St  Paul  in the Epistle praying for the Church of the  Ephesians  and from our Saviour's Pity to the Widow or the  Church  in the Gospel prays God  that he would cleanse and defend his Church and preserve it evermore by his Help and Goodness  The EPISTLE is an Instance of St  Paul  praying for the Church of the  Ephesians that they might be strengthned with Might by his Spirit in the InnerMan that Christ might dwell in their Hearts by Faith and that they might be filled with all the Fullness of God  Thus the Apostle in Effect prays in the Epistle that the Church may obtain what our Lord did for her in the Gospel And as the Epistle acknowledges  that God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think  so the Gospel gives us an Instance of this Power and Goodness in our Lord's raising up the Widow's Son when she neither ask'd nor thought he would be raised  The GOSPEL gives us an Instance of our Lord's  Cleansing Defending and Helping his Church  in the Story of his raising the  Widow's Son  to Life again as they were carrying him on the Bier to the Grave The Widow weeping for her Son  Bed in Dom    post Trin  is an Emblem of the  Church  now a Widow as it were in the Corporal Absence of her Lord weeping for her Sons who are dead in their Sins and the Lord's having Compassion on her and raising up her Son again represents to us that the Lord raises up those  who are dead in Sin to a Life of Righteousness  to the Comfort and  Epist  Glory of the Church  Boys e  Ze  per  ABOUT the Fall of the Leaf Men ordinarily be more subject to Sickness and Mortality than at other Times of the Year wherefore the Church hath alloted fitly this Scripture for this Season as a Sick Man's Salve to comfort  us against Diseases and Death Intimate+ting that Christ is the only Health of all the Living and everlasting Life of all such as die in him  The seventeenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect prays that God's Grace may always prevent and follow us and that he would make us after the Example of our Lord curing the dropsical Person on the  Sabbath Day  to be continually  given to all good Works  The EPISTLE makes mention of some of those good Works the Collect prays for and thereby Answers to the  Parable  of those who were bidden to the Marriage and exhorts us to Humility and Meekness telling us as it were that when we are bidden to the Wedding we should behave with  all Lowliness and Meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in Love  not aiming at a  Seat in the highest Room  as did the People in the Gospel  but endeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace  The GOSPEL in the Parable shews the Disesteem and Discredit that attend Pride and Haughtiness and the Advantage and Profit of Humility and Meekness  For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted  The eighteenth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Office of this Day relates to the Clergy and has been chosen very suitably by the Church For as this Sunday often happens to be the Sunday of Ordination after the  EmberEast  in  September  so nothing could be more suitable to the Season than the present Office  THE Collect prays for God's  Grace to withstand the World the Flesh and the Devil  and forasmuch as the Gospel tells us  That we must Love the Lord our God with all our Heart and all our Mind  it therefore prays God  That with pure Hearts and Minds we may follow him the only God  The EPISTLE tells us what Qualifications are more especially required in those to be admitted to holy Orders  that they should have Utterance and Knowledge and come behind in no Gift  The GOSPEL tells us how our Saviour answered the Question of the Lawyer and how he put the  Pharisees  to silence so that none of them was able to answer him a Word Which teaches us how the Ministers of Christ should be qualified that    Pet  iii▪  they should be able to give an answer to every one that asks them a Reason of the Hope that is in them  and to confute the  Gainsayers  The nineteeth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect considering the Epistle and Gospel prays that the  holy Spirit of God  whereby as the Epistle tell us  We are sealed to the Day of Redemption    may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts  that we may avoid  that Blindness of Heart  mentioned in the Epistle and not  think Evil in our Hearts  as did the  Scribes  in the Gospel  The EPISTLE is answerable to the Gospel and shews that the  Gentiles  before their Conversion were like  the Sick of the Palsie  in the Gospel  lying  in Sin which the Palsie is an Emblem of But after  they had learned Christ  they laid aside  the old Man and put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness They were not still in their Understandings darkned but were renewed in the Spirit of their Mind  The GOSPEL is the History of our Saviour's Curing the  Sick of the Palsie  who was brought to him on a  Bed  to whom also he gave Remission of Sins  Bed in Dom    post Trinit  This is a lively Representation of a Man living dissolutely and as the Epistle says of the  Gentiles alienated from the Life of God and given over unto Lasciviousness and all Uncleanness  But our blessed Lord cures him as he did the  Gentiles  in the Epistle  Epist  by putting of the old Man which is corrupt according to the deceitful Lusts and renewing him in the Spirit of his Mind  And when he  Gosp  rises up and  walks  from his Sins and  hath  Epist  put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness  then he is able to perform the Advice of the Epistle  and to let all Bitterness and Wrath and Anger and Clamour  c  be put away from him  The twentieth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect considering the Fate of them who would not come to the  Marriage  prays that  we being ready both in Body and Soul  may chearfully fulfill God's Commands and be obedient to his  Will  as the Epistle advises  The EPISTLE persuades as it were to make ready for the Wedding  that we walk circumspectly  that we be not  unwise  as those were who were invited  but understanding that it is the Will of the Lord  we should come to the  Wedding that we should not be drunk with Wine but be filled with the Spirit the Wedding Garment  required in the Gospel  The GOSPEL is the Parable of the  King  who made a Marriage for his Son Under which is signified that God sent his Servants to invite the Jews to the good Things he had provided for them in Heaven But when they behaved so ungratefully to his Servants  he came and destroyed those Murderers and burnt up their City  Jerusalem Then ordered he his Servants the Apostles who whilst the Jews were invited  and expected at the Wedding were  Mat  x  not to go into the Way of the Gentiles  to go into the  Highways  viz among the Gentiles and call them to the Marriage which they did  and so the Wedding was furnished with Guests But tho' many were called yet but Few were chosen  Those who came not in  the Wedding Garment  of an holy Life but cloathed only with a dull unactive Faith  were thrown into outer Darkness  The twenty first SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect from our Lord's Compassion on the  Nobleman  's Son in the Gospel having acknowledged the  Lord  to be  merciful  beseeches God from a View of the  Nobleman  's  Faith  and the Cure thereby wrought  that he would grant to his faithful People pardon that they may be cleansed from all their Sins  And from a Consideration of the Disquietudes and Troubles of the Christian Warfare mentioned in the Epistle it prays for  Peace that we may serve God with a quiet Mind  The EPISTLE shews the Enemies we have to combat in our spiritual Warfare and puts us into the Method of acquiring that  Peace  and  Quiet  the Collect prays for notwithstanding we are surrounded with them in the most hostile Manner For it advises us  to be strong in the Lord and in the Power of his Might  The GOSPEL is an Account of the  Nobleman  who desired Jesus to go down to  Capernaum  to heal his Son who was a dying to whom  Jesus  said  go thy way thy Son liveth  By  Theophy in Lo    this is represented to us that when our dear and immortal Souls are assaulted with Evils and Temptations almost to death and we come to our Lord and beg him to relieve us he sends us the Aid and Assistance of his holy Spirit So that  Psal  lx  when God arises his Enemies are scattered and they which hate him flee before him  Wherefore when we  are surrounded with the Fiery Darts  of the  Devil  Epist  let us be strong in the Lord and in the Power of his Might  The Twentysecond SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect imitating St  Paul  praying for the Church of the  Philipians  in the Epistle prays God the  King  in the Gospel who  took an Account of his Servants  to  keep his Household the Church in continual Godliness that through his Protection it may be free from all Adversities and devoutly given to serve him in all good Works to the Glory of his Holy Name through Jesus Christ our Lord viz  such  Epist  good Works  as the Apostle tells us in the Epistle God  had begun  in the  Philipians  and such as at the End of this Epistle are called  the Fruits of Righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the Glory and Praise of God  The EPISTLE shews the Love and Charity of St  Paul  to the Church of the  Philipians for  God says he is my Record how greatly I long after you all in the Bowels of Jesus Christ  And then he prays with such a Spirit of  brotherly Kindness  as is required in the Gospel  that their Love may abound yet more and more that they may be Sincere and without Offence 'till the Day of Christ  or  Gosp  or  till the King come to take an Account of his Servants  The GOSPEL is the Parable of the  unmerciful Servant  which is grounded upon a Question of  Peter  to our Lord  How often shall my Brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven Times Jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee until seven Times but until seventy Times seven Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven c  in which Parable is shewn the  great Mercy  of God in forgiving us such infinite Numbers of Sins and our  Unmercifulness  in not forgiving each other a petty Trespass And it also shews the grievous Consequence of such unbrotherly Treatment  viz  that the cruel and unmerciful will the  delivered  to those everlasting  Tormentors  the Flames of Hell where they can never pay the Debt of their Sins  THE Collect then prays that we may serve  God in good Works  the Epistle shews what these  good Works  are  viz  such as  God had begun  in the  Philipians that their Love might abound more and more to each other in Knowledge and in all Judgment that they might approve c  And the Gospel gives us an Example of  good Works  in the King mentioned in it and threatens us with eternal Misery if we do not follow it  The twentythird SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect prays  that God would be ready to hear the devout Prayers of his Church  and that he would grant her the Petitions  Jam  xvi  she asks in Faith  The EPISTLE takes Notice of two Sorts of People the one of which has their  Conversation in Heaven the other Minds earthly Things  the one pays the  Tribute  of a holy Life to God the other  makes a God of their Belly  The one at the Resurrection  shall have a Body fashioned like unto the Body of their Saviour  the other  shall end in Destruction  The GOSPEL teaches us  to render unto Caesar the Things that are Caesar's and unto God the Things which are God's  Some of the Ritualists observe that as we are commanded by our Lord  to render unto Caesar the Things which are Caesar's  and are therefore to render him a Tribute with his own Image upon it so we are likewise  to render unto God the Things that are God's  by rendring him as the Epistle recommends the Tribute of a pure and holy Soul which is stamped with his own Image and if we conform our selves here to the Image of Christ  He shall  hereafter  Transform our  Epist  vile Body that it may be like unto his glorious Body  The twenty fourth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THE Collect having before its Eyes in the Gospel the Story of our Saviour's raising up the  dead Maid  to Life again and healing the  Woman  of her  Disease  prays therefore that God would in like Manner  absolve his People from their Offences and of his same bountiful Goodness deliver them from the Bands of their Sins  The EPISTLE gives and Account of the Conversion of the  Gentiles  at  Collosse and shews St  Paul  praying for their Continuance and Growth in the Faith and that they may be thankful to the Father who made them meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light  The Epistle therefore as it mentions the Conversion of the  Gentiles  and what they owe to God for it is very suitable to the Gospel  The GOSPEL is the Story of the Woman that was cured of the  Issue of Blood  and of  Jairus  's  Daughter  who was raised from the Dead The  Woman  was a  Gentile  the  Maid  was a  Jew  The  Woman  had been ill  twelve Years  the  Maid  was  twelve  Luke  viii  Years  old The  Woman  was cured of her Disease as  Jesus  was going to cure the  Maid  Observe then the Mystery in the  Jews and Gentiles  As the  Woman  was taken ill when the  Maid  was born so the  Gentiles  degenerated into Idolatry when the  Jews  believed in the  Loyns of  Abraham As  Jesus  went down to heal the  Maid  and in the Going the  Woman  was first healed  so  Jesus  came first to the  Jews  but the  Gentiles  first believed and were saved And as at last he went down to the  Ruler  's  House  and raised his Daughter  from the Dead  so in the End the  Jews  also shall be converted  The twenty fifth SUNDAY after  Trinity  THIS Sunday being the Forerunner of  Advent  the Church hath ordered the Office of this day to have Relation to our Saviour's Coming into the World that we may be put in mind of the Season and    THE Collect  may bring forth  Coming of our Lor    THE Portion  is very suitable to  Prophecy of our  Days come saith the  David  a righteous Branc  Name whereby he  shall be  OUR RIGHTEOUSN  The GOSPEL has been  the Sake of these Words in  This is of a Truth that Prophet  into the World  Which Words make it very suitable to this Sunday which is the immediate Forerunner of  Advent  There is also another Reason of its being read now which see in the seventh Sunday after  Trinity  FINIS
