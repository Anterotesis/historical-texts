 THE ADVANTAGES OF THE  EastIndia  Trade TO  ENGLAND  CONSIDER'D  Price  s    d    THE ADVANTAGES OF PEACE AND COMMERCE WITH Some REMARKS on the  EastIndia  Trade  LONDON  Printed for J BROTHERTON and THO COX in  Cornhill  and sold by A DODD without  TempleBar    THE ADVANTAGES OF  Peace  and  Commerce  PEACE and Trade have so far got the Start of War and the Sword that the  Trading Nations  of the World are now become infinitely superior in Wealth and Power to those who might properly be call'd the  Fighting Nations  and whose Grandure depended upon the Extent of their Dominions and Number of conquer'd Countries  Nor is this Superiority obtain'd by the Policy of their Government the Prudence of their Counsels or the Valour of their Troops so much as by the  Increase of their Commerce  This has enlarg'd their Wealth and Power attracted Multitudes to dwell in the most narrow and prescribed Bounds and found  Subsistence for them where the Country it self could not maintain the tenth Part of them By this they have raised a Naval Strength which has made them terrible at Sea as well as formidable on Shore By this they have been able on all Occasions to carry the War home to their Enemies Coasts however distant and even in the remotest Parts of the Globe By this they look into every Port knock at every Door command Peace or War and in a word awe the World  All the formidable Fleets of  England Holland France Spain  and the  Baltick  what would they signify if the respective Countries to which they belong could not find able Seamen to man and manage them 'Tis as they are or not able to do this that even those Maritime Powers are more or less potent at Sea and this is all in proportion to their Trade Their Seamen are the Strength of their Fleet and those Seamen are nourish'd increas'd and in Time of Peace employ'd and thereby kept up to their Number only by Trade nothing else can do it  Abundance of useful Inferences might be drawn from these Observations but I wave them for the present to bring all down to the Point I have now more immediately in view which is this That whoever would learn to know the World and would go  the best and readiest Way to obtain a just Idea of its present State as well as of the Situation of the several Countries in it has nothing to do but to study Trade  Learn to understand the Commerce of the World and of course you are led into its Geography or the Description of its Situation By this means you will be insensibly drawn into a Knowledge of the Distances of one Country from another of their Position on the Globe and how they stand with respect to one another By inquiring which way their Commerce is carried on you necessarily come to know whether they are inland Countries or bordering on the Sea whether Islands or contiguous to one another and to the Continent whether to be travell'd to and traded with by Land or by Water or perhaps by both  Nor is the Situation of Nations only known by the Study of Trade but by this Means also their several Interests are judg'd of as also their Ability to support one another and themselves which way their Strength lies and how it exerts it self whether by Land or Sea And all their navigable Rivers and trading Ports are known by the Navigation which is employ'd between them and the Trade which is carried on in them  The Number of the People the Wealth and consequently the Strength of Nations are all learnt by the same Study By this you see the Richness of their Product the Bulk of their Exportations and Number of Ships employ'd in their Trade Even the Diligence and Application of their People is judg'd of by the Quantity and Goodness of their Manufactures and the Produce of their Country appearing in Trade  To know Trade then is to know the World And I may farther observe That if any one Nation could govern Trade that Nation would govern the World could it give Laws to the Commerce it would give Laws to the People and the whole World would be its Dependents and Subjects  Not so much the Histories of past Times as the many Examples of the present confirm this The Trading Nations are certainly the most formidable at this time and that they are so in consequence of their Superiority in Trade may appear in that all those Nations which were formerly great in Trade but since declin'd are in proportion declin'd in their Strength as their Trade has fallen off The City of  Antwerp  is a noted Instance of this as are almost all the  Hans Towns  in  Germany  also  Novogr  d  in  Russia  and several others whose History we may find as it respects their former Greatness and particularly their present  Decay with the Causes of it in the  Atlas Maritimus  lately publish'd which in almost every Part of it confirms this Maxim by Examples in the most considerable Cities and States in the World  The late  French  King  Lewis  XIV more justly on that account call'd  Great  than for the Glory of his Arms saw plainly that the Way to make the  French  Nation the Terror of the World was not so much by the Success of his Arms and his Conquests upon his Neighbours as by encouraging the Commerce of his own Country and employing the vast Numbers of People which his Dominions were every where full of and which he found out of Business and starving in the several Branches of Trade as Arts Manufactures Navigation Fishing  c  by which means the Poor were every where set to work if not made to work and of Consequence fed and cloth'd almost every Province being put in a Capacity to feed and employ their own Hands and the Effects of this are to this Day very visible and plain in the following Instances  His  Tallie  which is a Tax upon all the Families of the  Plebeii  or meaner trading People only is visibly increas'd and raises now some Millions more than it usually did  His Subjects especially in the manufacturing and trading Towns grew rich and had he not been oblig'd by the Distress of the War to oppress them afterwards with heavy and almost insupportable Taxes by which the publick Credit sunk and grew precarious and the Bank of  Lyons  in particular was ruin'd and fail'd and the Coin debas'd almost to nothing so that their Crown was not worth the antient  Livre  in exchange I say had not these things follow'd by the Distresses of the War the common trading People of  France  had been rich and 'tis evident that they grow rich apace since the War by the meer Increase of their Manufactures at home  In a farther Pursuit of the same Maxims the King turn'd his Eye to the Sea and took proper Measures for the Increase of Shipping the Encouragement of Seamen the setting up Companies Fisheries and the like that his Subjects might be employ'd as well by Water as by Land and that he might be able to man and fit out his Ships of War with able Seamen of his own which the  French  have since done but were never able to do before  The Encouragement this gave to his People and their Opulence by Sea evidently appear'd even to the Terror of  Europe  in  the mighty Fleets which he fitted out in a few Years after he began those Regulations Fleets superior even to the united Naval Powers of  England  and  Holland  Nor had this Naval Power of  France  been broken had it not been for the meer Arrogance of the King himself who in a mistaken Confidence of his own Power positively order'd Mons  Tourville  his Admiral to fight the Confederate Fleet not thinking they were join'd and whether they were join'd or no by which means he was overthrown and some of the finest Ships in the World set on fire in their own Ports and some even by their own Hands a Loss they never recover'd But this by the way The fitting out such a Fleet as the  French  had in the Action at  Beachy  in the Year is fully to the Point in Hand where they had Men of War of the Line from Guns and upwards among which were no less than threeDeck Ships and as I have been told above Men whereof were able Seamen of their own All these Advances in the  French  King's Dominions by means of Trade are at large describ'd in the foremention'd Book to which I refer the Curious  These are the Effects of Trade where the Increase and Cultivation of it are made the Care of the Publick The States of  Holland  are another Instance hereof whose formidable  Power has increas'd with their Trade and by the Assistance of that only as on the other hand the Decay of the  Spanish  Power which in the Time of  Philip  II was a Terror to the whole World and was rais'd on the meer Increase of their Trade has apparently been occasion'd by the Decay of their Trade out of which they were every where driven by the  Dutch  The whole World as well Pagan as Christian is full of Examples of this kind But to give one for all the rest a Comparison between the  Eastern  Provinces of  Asia  such as we call the  EastIndies  and  China  and the whole Country of  Africa  will confirm this Observation beyond all Contradiction  We see the whole Quarter of the World call'd  Africa  large to an Extreme suited by its Climate and Situation for all manner of Improvements as well by Cultivation as Commerce populous at least on the Sea Coasts equally almost to any other Part and in some Places more populous than most other Parts of the World  Their Ports Harbours Rivers and Bays were they frequented and the safe Roads fully described are more in number than in most other Countries and their prodigious Length of Coast cannot but render this Part of the World admirably situated for the Advantages of Commerce For the whole  Country call'd  Africa  is an Island except the small Isthmus or Neck of Land from  Suez  on the  Red Sea  to  Alexandria  which is not above Miles Nay so well fitted for Trade is  Africa  that a late Author tells us there are more and greater Rivers in it and more adapted to Commerce and to Inland Navigation than in all the Country of  America  those of  Virginia  and  Carolina  only excepted  But in the midst of all these Advantages thro' the Indolence and Ignorance of the Natives on one hand and the barbarous Tyranny of the  Moors  and  Turks  on the other the  European  Nations having planted but few Colonies on her Continent we see this whole Country in a manner left desolate no Improvement no settled Government but vast Extents of Land neglected whole Provinces left wild and like a  Terra deserta  remaining in a meer State of Nature And all for want of Trade  The Soil is in many Places very rich and the Product of Nature exceeds all the rest of the known World The North Coast for almost Miles commonly call'd the Coast of  Barbary  produces the finest Copper and in great Quantities All the Fruits that the South Coast of  Spain  is so famous for are produced here in the greatest Plenty and perfection such as Raisins Pomegranates Lemons Oranges Almonds and to sum up all such a prodigious Quantity of the  best Wheat  Vide  Capt  Braithwaite'  s late History of the Revolutions in  Morocco  that were it not inhabited by the worst of Diones and govern'd by the worst of Tyrants the  Turks  and  Moors  it would be the Granary of  Europe  Whereas now it is poor naked and much of it barren and almost starves its indolent unimproving Inhabitants  The West Coast produces Honey Wax  Guinea  Grains Furrs Civet Drugs and Gums of very rich kinds and besides all these Gold and Elephants Teeth in abundance The East Coast produces Gold and Teeth also and Black Cattle without Number and going North from the Coast of  Zanguebar  up to the  Red Sea  it furnishes  Arabia  with the finest and best Breed of Horses And besides all this were not the West Shore of the  Red Sea  possess'd by the  Turks  who will suffer no free Trade with  Aethiopia  it is not to be express'd what a Scene of Wealth and Commerce would open it self there  And  Africa  is not only thus rich in its actual Produce but the Soil is of such a Nature as to be capable of vast Improvements were it duly cultivated and manag'd The Author of the  Atlas  assures us that the Sugars of  Barbadoes  and  Jamaica  as also Cotton Ginger Indico and Cocoa have all been try'd there and thrive to a Wonder And other Authors as well  English  as  Dutch  concur with him and tell us that Experiments have been made of the Coffee of  Mocha  the Tea of  China  and  Japan  c and we are told there are Plants of both now in the  Africa  Company's Garden at  CapeCoast Castle  And indeed why should those valuable Productions fail in  Africa  when planted in the very same Climate in which they grow to such Perfection in  Arabia  and  China  But for a farther Account and indeed a very particular one of the probable 'Improvements that might be made in this Part of the World I must refer to the Book before mention'd it not being possible to treat particularly of these things in the Compass of so short a Piece as this is  What we have now to observe and which is to our present Purpose is That with all this Wealth in Nature and all the Improvements which might be added by the help of Industry and Art there is no Commerce worth naming in  Africa  The Northern People despising Trade live by Rapine being almost all Corsairs and Pirates such as the  Algerines Tuniseens  and  Tripolins  together with the  Moors  of  Sallee  and  Alfarache  on the Northwest Shore The other Western Coasts have so little Employment for the many Millions that inhabit it I mean from the  Rio Grande  or  Niger  North to the  Congo  South that for  want of Produce they sell one another and the People are carried away by Thousands Men Women and Children to the Number as some think of in a Year to labour and work for the more diligent  Europeans  in  America  Here is a flagrant Example of the Weakness and Deficiency of a Country for want of Trade in spite of all the Bounty of Nature and of the most evident Capacity for the best Trade in the World  I might enlarge here upon the Situation of  Africa  for Improvement and Commerce as its lying between all the Trading Quarters of the World and its Nearness to  Europe  which is the Market for all its Productions also how it might be encourag'd to build and employ Ships and might raise a sufficient Fund of Goods for the Employment of Shipping as well as Gold to pay them But all this is fully done in the  Atlas  which gives a distinct Account of the Commerce both as it now is and as it is capable of being increas'd and shews how much superior  Africa  would be to  America  or even to  India  it self if it was encourag'd by settled Colonies as the former or inhabited by a trading manufacturing People as the latter I cannot therefore leave this Particular without recommending it to the Age to study the enlarging of Commerce the encouraging of Industry the planting  of desolate Countries and the employing those indolent Nations who tho they may be said to be idle yet 'tis not so much for want of Will to work as for want of some to employ them and instruct them what to do  I have now done with one Branch of the Comparison  viz  the State of  Africa  with respect to Trade Let us next look into an Extreme the other Way I mean in the  Indies  that is to say the Countries of  Malabar India Proper Ceylon Coromandel Bengal Siam Pegu CochinChina  with  China  it self and  Japan  It cannot be said but that the Natives of some if not most of these Countries are or were originally as ignorant and stupid as the  Negroes  of  Africa  excepting always the People of  China  and even in  Africa  the People of  Aethiopia  But the  Indians  are enur'd to Trade and have a natural Genius to Industry and Application and so they fall upon Labour whilst the  Africans  are indolent and spread their Manufactures the Work of their People over the whole World whereas the other sell not the Work of the People but the People themselves  And what is the Consequence of all this but that these Nations of  India  are rich populous and powerful Nay the  Mogul  who is call'd the most powerful Emperor of  India  and the  Grand Tartar  who is the like in  China  are made so rich and strong meerly by the immense Wealth arising from their Trade  The  Chinese  have not any Sea Coast except along the Eastern Shore of their Country and yet they spread the Sea with their Ships and have such an infinite Number that one who describes that Country said he believed they had Ships enough to make a Bridge from thence into  France  It is supposed he would not be taken literally but we may venture to conclude from thence that he found there an infinite Number of Vessels of all kinds  The Power and Riches of  China  are well worth a large Description as also the Multitude of Cities of which some are so great as to contain by Report or of People and the Provinces which however remote from the Sea or from the capital City are full of considerable Towns large Villages scattered Hamlets and Dwellings and all surprizingly full of People  If we inquire into the Reason of this we shall find it all owing to Trade and the mighty Commerce they carry on as well by Land as by Sea We see the Produce of their Land is coveted by all the  Europeans  and by us in particular witness especially their Tea their  China  Ware and several of  their Drugs and other Growth of their Soil And as for their Manufactures they were not only brought hither in vast Quantities but they became as it were the Terror of  Europe  in Trade and of  Great Britain  in particular so that we were oblig'd to make Laws to keep them out and to prohibit the Use and Wearing of them otherwise they would ruin and destroy our own Manufacture  How these populous Countries pursue their Commerce and especially their Manufactures with an indefatigable Application appears from the immense Quantity of Goods they would import upon us if they were not prohibited and the Author of the  Atlas  has prov'd that the People of  India  and  China  are able to clothe the whole World with their Manufactures and that they trade with  Europe  infinitely to its Loss and to their own Gain for that in effect all the ready Money of the other three Parts of the World all the Gold and Silver of  Africa  and  America  would be hardly able to serve for Returns all which he makes out very clearly even to the meanest Capacity  Hence we see the Justice of the Prohibitions in  England  and also in  France  I mean the prohibiting the Use and Wearing of these foreign Manufactures For if Commerce be the Life and Soul of a Nation's Prosperity if we are more or less rich and powerful as our Trade is more or  less flourishing it must be understood of such Trade only as we gain by not of pernicious Trading and which we cannot carry on but to our Loss And this may occasion some unusual Speculations concerning the great Strife we find among the  European  Powers about who shall or shall not carry on this Trade to  India  For if it be true that  Europe  in general loses by it and that it exhausts the Treasure of all our Trading Countries returning nothing but its own Produce and its own Manufactures and receiving little from us but our Bullion and Coin which is the Essence of our Produce I mean by Ʋs here the  Europeans  I say if this be true it would be the undoubted Interest of all  Europe  to prohibit that Commerce except what is absolutely necessary for the supply of  Europe  's Wants that is to say things that we cannot be without such as Saltpetre Pepper Spices needful Drugs and Dyestuffs and the like all which are the natural Product or Growth of the Country and not to meddle with any of their Manufactures which indeed are the things that injure the Commerce of  Europe  and impoverish the People  As to the Coffee and Tea which are the two great Articles so much in Demand 'tis sufficient to observe that we might transplant those Vegetables and many more  from  Arabia India  and  China  into  Africa  and with a very little Application might raise them all and in sufficient Quantities in our own Factories on the Coast of  Guinea  This the  Dutch  have begun with success in relation to the Coffee which they have raised already in so great a Quantity at  Ba  avia  that they setch very little now from  Mocha  And we are told also that they have made another Attempt for planting Coffee at  Surinam  on the Coast of  Nova Audalusia  in  America  where it also thrives very well But this is a Digression from the present Purpose and for a farther Inquiry into these things I refer the Reader to the foremention'd  Atlas  where he will see them explain'd and treated on at large  However I cannot quit this Discourse of the  India  Trade without hinting as I go that I think while this Part of  Europe  is so busily engag'd even almost to a War for preventing Encroachments upon this Trade it is very strange they should entirely neglect a BackDoor by which all the most hurtful Part of the  EastIndia  Trade is like and very quickly too to break in upon them like a Flood and that with a Force which they will not find it easy to resist I mean by the Way of  Russia  and that as well by Caravans over Land from  China  as by Water that is to say by a  River Navigation from the Great  Mogul  's Dominions which is more properly and particularly call'd  EastIndia  Which I shall have occasion to mention again by and by  Let me now speak a little of the Benefit and Advantage of  Peace  in relation to  Trade  as I join'd them together at first  Peace is certainly the Right Hand of Trade it is its Support and Defence It is by Peace alone that the flourishing and prosperous State of Trade is preserv'd if not procur'd The History of our Trade in  England  would abundantly confirm this The first Introduction of our Woollen Manufacture was under the peaceable Reign of  Henry  VII During those twenty Years it took its first and deepest Root The next Reign was not so quiet The Suppression of Monasteries at home the Perplexities about the Queens and the Wars in  France  and  Flanders  embarass'd the Court and the Clergy but the common People were generally kept out of the Quarrel and their Trade still took root at home  Persecution indeed in the latter End of King  Henvy  VIII's Reign and thro' the whole Reign of his Daughter Queen  Mary  nay even during the Reformation in  Edward  VI's Reign take them all together  harass'd the People and extremely interrupted Commerce In one Reign one sort of People were uneasy in the next another in the third another Alternately one Side and the other fled from their Dwellings secur'd their Effects and hid themselves for their Lives In one Reign one Side rebell'd and in another Reign another In king  Edward  VI's Reign the  Norfolk  and the  Devonshire  People rebelled for the Mass in Queen  Mary  's Time Sir  Thomas Wyatt  and the  Kentish  Men rebelled for the Reformation And by all these things Trade was interrupted  When Queen  Elizabeth  came to the Crown Trade flourish'd in such a manner as surpriz'd the World because the Glory of her Arms gave her an Advantage to spread it abroad as we may say to all Nations and the Root it had taken in the Times of Peace under the two  Henrys  had given the Merchants a Strength of Stock to extend it into the remotest Parts of the World  The Queen whatever Part she bore in the Wars abroad always kept her Subjects in Peace at home the Intervals occasion'd by the Insurrection of the Earl of  Westmorland  and others were not worth naming This Peace at home and the Support and Assistance the Queen gave to her Merchants abroad laid the Foundation of the most flourishing Branches of our Trade  viz  our  Turkey Hamborough  and  Muscovy  Companies and especially the planting Colonies abroad particularly in  America  Whoever consults the abovemention'd Author will find that the Discovery and peopling of all our most considerable Colonies in  America  were perform'd in her Reign and will see from what small Beginnings those flourishing Plantations have been raised to their present Greatness the peaceable Possession being preserv'd by the powerful Influence of  England  If War at any time interrupted them as the Wars they had with the Natives often did their Trade was greatly lessen'd the Plantations spoil'd and the whole very much endanger'd as has been the Case of  Virginia  and  New England  more than once  In the same Queen's Reign the first Voyages were made to the Gold Coast of  Africa  which we now call  Guinea  and all was supported by the Purses of her Merchants and trading People grown rich by the success of Trade in the peaceable Reigns of her Predecessors So that in her Reign it might be said to arrive to its first Glory and even to its Meridian Height counting one Hundred Years from its Beginning  It may be true that the great Success of Queen  Elizabeth  in her Maritime Affairs and the Terror of her Name gave a vast  Addition to the Glory of her Reign But it was her prodigious Extending and Encouraging the Commerce of her Subjects that gave Stability of Greatness and Power to the whole Kingdom and it was upon the foot of the Greatness of her Trade that the Nation became formidable over the whole World  Witness for this the Regard shewn to her Embassies which by the way consisted of Merchants chiefly at the Courts of  Constantinople Ispahan  in  Persia  and  Moscow  in all which her Merchants were admitted and her Letters in their behalf receiv'd with the greatest Respect tho no  English  Minister of State or Envoy had ever been seen or perhaps heard of in any of those Courts before  From hence to this very Day the Commerce of  Great Britain  has been the Glory of our Country as it is the Fund of our Power Kings and Princes may declare War and lead Armies and Victory sometimes attend the fortunate Inferior But generally speaking the longest Purse not the longest Sword gets the Day in the End and as nothing can furnish Money like Commerce so the Trading Countries have manifestly the Advantage in a War  This indeed is a good Reason why  England  of all other Nations should be the least afraid of a War And yet at the  same time let me hint to our Countrymen who are so forward for Fighting That we are likely always to suffer the greatest Disadvantages in case of a War and the Reason is plain because of our infinite Number of Ships and Merchants and Merchants Effects which are abroad in every Corner of the World No Nation has so much to lose and no Nation can suffer so great Loss in case of a War  Therefore I cannot but pay a great Deference to the Endeavours of those Ministers who notwithstanding the Murmurs of the People apply themselves to the preserving the Peace of  Europe  and preventing a War War to a Trading Nation is a Degree of Death it is a strong Paralytick it stagnates the Blood and in a word is fatal if not to the Trade it self in general yet to the Prosperity and Health of it And tho our Trade being the greatest without Dispute in the World is therefore best able to support us in a War yet our Trade too would suffer most by a War even for this very Reason because it is the greatest  But to look a little abroad again Other Nations are visibly increas'd in Power by the Help of their Commerce as well as  England  and the  Dutch  are the next Example  The Author of the  Atlas  gives a distinct View of the prodigious Trade they carry on He touches upon their small Beginnings and shews how they were elevated meerly by their Commerce from the  Poor and Distressed States  the Style in which they addressed Queen  Elizabeth  for Aid against the  Spaniards  to that of the  High and Mighty Lords the States General  the Style in which they now treat both with their Allies and Enemies  He describes their foreign Trade their Fisheries and their  Greenland  Trade in an especial manner of which there is indeed a surprizing Account He gives the History of their first Adventures to the  EastIndies  and their Progress and Conquest there over the  Portuguese  Settlements He shews the Glory and Grandeur of their City of  Batavia  and indeed that very Place is a convincing Proof of what I have advanced the formidable Power of that City and of all the  Dutch  Settlements in the  Indies  being entirely raised by Commerce without the least Assistance from the Government or the publick Stock in  Holland  He gives an Account likewise of all their Inland Trade the greatest perhaps of its kind in the World a Trade wholly carry'd on by River Navigation by the Help of Boats Hoys Bylanders and such Vessels upon the great Rivers of the  Scheld  the  Maes  the  Rhine  the  Ems  and the  Weser  and from those Rivers again by the  Lys  the  Scarp  and  Sambre  the  Moselle  the  Saar  the  Maine  the  Neckar  and abundance of other navigable Streams into the very Heart of  Germany France  and the  Austrian Netherlands  and quite up into  Switzerland  'Tis to be observ'd here likewise that nothing but Peace could raise such a Commerce to a People distress'd as they were before by all the Extremities of War to such a Degree that we have been told they were once upon the Point of resolving to ship themselves all off Poor and Rich to quit their Country to the  Spaniards  and go away to the  EastIndies  But the War ending first in a Truce of twelve Years and after that in a perpetual Peace how soon did the Case alter with them Peace raised Trade their Trade raised their Wealth and their Wealth raised their Power in which their Fleets are so formidable that  England  only excepted they are able to fight all the other Maritime Powers of  Europe  I had almost said if they were join'd together Here is indeed an undoubted Testimony to my first Assertion  viz  That the Trading Nations are the most powerful Nations  I might run thro' the particular Cases of all the Nations in  Europe  but I shall only add the  Muscovites  or  Russians  How feeble this vastly extended Empire was about thirty Years ago I need not say They had not one Port in all the Trading Seas of the World by which they could correspond with any Part of  Europe Archangel  on the frozen Northern Coast only excepted  For want of this of what Consideration were they in the Account of  Europe  's Strength How little did they weigh in the Balance of Power And they were regarded in the several Courts of  Europe  accordingly so that the  Turks  told them upon some Occasion that they neither understood how to make War or Peace Thus contemptible were they tho at the same time the  Czar  had a Country under his Dominion as big as all the rest of  Europe  And the Reason of all this low Figure they made was evidently this and nothing else  viz  That they had no Trade no Commerce or Correspondence with the rest of the World  Observe now the Difference When the late Czar  Peter  came to the Government and by his Prudence and Politicks ally'd himself with the Trading Countries of  Europe  beginning to teach his People the Arts of Navigation and Commerce as soon as he did this he got Money rais'd Troops shew'd the World that his Men might be taught to fight as well as other Nations  and soon brought them to do so As soon as the Prosperity of Trade made them feel something of the Advantages accruing by it we find him pushing himself upon the  Swedes  gaining from them the Maritime Provinces they possess'd in the  Baltick  and as he open'd the Seas for his People to trade they soon enabled him to spread those Seas with his Men of War so that he became an Overmatch either for the  Dane  or the  Swede  and had he lived a few Years longer he would have begun to appear formidable in the Ocean as well as he had done in the  Baltick  Sea  We have seen the Successors of this Prince however unactive in other Matters extremely diligent in this of Trade The present  Czar  is now establishing the Commerce of his Subjects to all Parts of the World and his Eastern Commerce in particular in a surprizing manner as well with  China  as  India Persia  and  Turkey  This he does partly by a Communication of Rivers and partly by the  Caspian  Sea and also by Land And this brings me back to what I mention'd before  viz  That the Trade with the  EastIndies  was likely to break in upon  Europe  this Way in a Manner too powerful to be resisted and in a Way more fatal than either the Emperor's late Company erected at  Ostend  or any other Rivals whatsoever  It is but a few Days ago that Letters from  Petersburg  brought an Account of the Return of Mons  Winderowitz  the  Russian  Embassador to the Emperor of  China  and of the Success of his Embassy at that Court How he had settled the Limits of the two Empires which had in vain been attempted for above sixty Years before and withal had made a particular Treaty of Commerce by which a free Trade is establish'd between the two Empires and all the Hindrances Scruples and troublesom Ceremonies which obstructed it and in particular the Tolls Presents and other Demands made by the  Chinese  Officers at the passing the great Wall of  China  are taken off and all other Tolls and Payments Presents or Fees taken at the Entrance into any City or Province which were before uncertain and arbitrary are all remov'd and turn'd into one general Duty or Custom of Import and Export as in other Countries and this Duty or Custom to be unalterable except on due Notice given on both Sides  Besides this they have settled the placing of Guards in proper Places and the building of Caravanseras or fortify'd Inns upon the Road for the Reception of Merchants and their Goods and the Governours of every Province are to be made answerable for any Robberies committed by the  Tartars  or any other Rovers within their Bounds due Notice  being always given of the Approach of such Merchants or their Caravans  By this means they assure us that the Trade between  China  and  Russia  will be as safe and easy as it is or can be in  Europe  between one Province and another and that the Caravans shall go and come with such Freedom that there shall arrive in  Russia  at least one great Caravan consisting of four five or six Hundred Camels a Month and sometimes three or four such in a Month  It would be worth while to describe here the Manner of the March of these Caravans how they are furnish'd with Provisions in such great Desarts as they are oblig'd to pass over what Hazards they run from the Robbers and  Tartars  upon the way and the like As also to describe the Way it self and what vast Circuits they take for the Convenience of coming to inhabited Countries and navigable Rivers especially the great Rivers  Janizea  and  Oby  the River  Irtisk  and at last the  Dwina  by which they are brought up to  Wo  gda  from whence they have but a short Passage to the Lakes  Onega  and  Ladoga  by which they come to  Petersburg  But as this would be too tedious for the narrow Compass of this Work so it is not so directly to my present Purpose  To return therefore to the Point which is more immediately before me We are told  that these Measures being enter'd into by the Government of  Russia  the Trade is to be carry'd on by a Company to be incorporated and to be furnish'd with all needful royal Privileges and Assurances of Protection and of a constant Care of their Interests at the Emperor of  China  's Court by the  Russian  Emperor And we are also told that the Merchants of  Lubec  are or are to be very far interested in the said Company  The Goods to be imported this Way from  China  are to be sure all the finest and most portable such as wrought and raw Silks the former in the known Variety in which we usually imported them from thence also Gold in Specie Drugs of various kinds and Tea Whether any of the Goods usually brought from the Bay of  Bengal  and other Parts of  India  may find their Way by this Rout we cannot determine But if this Trade should now be open'd as above and all these Goods be brought upon such easy Terms of Carriage as they assure us shall be done and we should see them publickly put up in open sale at  Petersburg  and perhaps at  Lubec  it naturally leads me to ask to what Purpose is all this Stress laid upon the erecting an  Ostend  Company Certainly the opening a Trade to  India  in general is the main thing to be consider'd not whether it shall be done by one Nation or another one Prince or another For a Sale of  EastIndia  and  China  Goods at  Lubec  or at  Ostend  at  Petersburg  in the Gulph of  Finland  or at  Trieste  in the Gulph of  Venice  is much the same thing to the Commerce of  Europe  Unless therefore some Check can be put to the erecting such a Company as this and that I do not see is any way practicable the suppressing that at  Ostend  does not in my Opinion seem to promise much to the Commerce But to go on with the  Muscovite  Company  Besides this BackDoor Trade for so it may be justly call'd to  China  the late Czar had laid a Scheme for another and I must acknowledge it seems very practicable according to the Situation of the Country and the Sources and Courses of the Rivers  Indus Ganges  and  Oxus  as they are laid down in the said  Atlas Maritimus  This Trade according to the Czar's Design was thus  viz  That by a short Passage over Land from the  Ganges  and the  Indus  the one running into the Bay of  Bengal  by the Factories of  Hugeley  and  Calcuta  and the other running into the  Indian  Ocean not far from  Suratte  and between that and the Gulph of  Persia  I say the Czar's Design was that Caravans should be appointed from both those great Rivers to the River  Oxus  the Distance from either of them being not above to Miles and all the rich Goods of either Coast of  India  viz of the  Coast of  India  and  Malabar  by the  Indus  and of the Coast of  Coromandel  and  Golconda  by the  Ganges  should be brought into the  Caspian  Sea from thence by Ship to  Astracan  on the  Wolga  and from  Astracan  by the  Wolga  and by the new Canal which the Czar begun into the Lake  Ladoga  and then by the  Neva  to  Petersburg  So that all this Trade would be carry'd on by Water from the remotest Parts of  India  except about to Miles as above  I need not enumerate all the several sorts of Goods which would come into  Europe  by this Passage it is enough to say that they would leave us under no Necessity to bring any thing about by long Sea except the heavy and bulky Goods As for Spices we see them even already sold at  Moscow  cheaper than we can buy them here and the like of the raw Silk of  Georgia  and  Guylan  which has been brought if I am not misinform'd to  Petersburg  and thence to  Lubec  and to  Hamburgh  cheaper than by the  Turkey  Trade to  London  If the Carriage by these Rivers and Caravans does not add too much to the Value of these Goods as we are told it does not the Labour of the People or Cattle amounting to but very little in those Countries I do not see that the immoderate Length of the Passage bears any Weight in the Account  Besides here is one Advantage which the Passage by Sea wants  viz  here is no hazard of Loss no Premium to be given for Insurance no Fear of Enemies or Pirates or of long and chargeable Embargoes no Averages to allow upon damag'd Goods or Abatement for Goods touch'd with salt Water  The Navigation of the Rivers is without Risk the Passage over the  Caspian  Sea is a Trifle if the Vessels are well built they very rarely miscarry Whereas we find the Ships which go on with our Trade often subjected to Loss and Miscarriage sometimes foundring at Sea blown up by Accident with Powder taken by Pirates and Corsairs as one of the  Ostend  Ships was lately by the  Turks  of  Barbary  And it is but a few Years since no less than fourteen Sail of the best Ships  English  as well as  Dutch  very richly laden were cast away at the Cape of  Good Hope  as they rode there at Anchor and all the Goods and People lost If these Losses are discounted out of the Profits of the Company they belong to I am of Opinion they would more than balance the Difference of Freight in seven Years Commerce But let the Freight or Carriage be what it will if they sell their Goods as cheap at Market as our Companies do or can do I think the Question is answer'd and it appears that these BackDoors  will in a very little time rob  Europe  of as much Money in their  EastIndia  Commerce as not the  Ostend  Company only but as all the other Companies put together  Nor is it possible at least I do not see it possible for all the Powers of  Europe  to prevent it As for us and the other Maritime Powers our Naval Strength does not signify one Farthing to it for not a Ship if we had twenty times as many can come near to act in any Capacity in the whole Trade from  India  to  Petersburg  Fleets and Navies are all out of the Question the Carriage is all by Rivers except one great Pond for the  Mare Caspium  is no more and these Rivers take the Czar and the Great Mogul together are all within their own Territories and out of every Body's Reach  All I see possible to be done is to prohibit Trade with  Petersburg  and the other  Russian  Ports or if you will go a shorter Way to commence a War and beat the  Muscovites  out of  Livonia  and  Ingria  and so give them no Ingress to the  Baltick  Sea tho this is not so easy to be done as some may imagine And yet if it were done they would still find some Vent or other for their Trade and if they had the Goods we should find some Way or other to come at them For the Prospect of Gain is always  such a Spur to the Merchant that nothing can restrain him  Extremos currit mercator ad Indos  That this Way of Trade from  India  to  Muscovy  is not impracticable may appear from hence That it was always one of the Gates by which the  Indian  Goods found a Passage into  Europe  before the Passage by Sea about the Cape of  Good Hope  was found out For those Goods were brought from the  Ganges  and the  Indus  to the  Oxus  thence touching at the great City  Persepolis  destroy'd by  Alexander the Great  down the same River into the  Caspian  Sea and so into  Muscovy  by the  Wolga  This Channel of Trade the  Muscovites  always kept open only they did not then find a Way to carry on the Traffick into the rest of  Europe  they having little or no Correspondence with the Princes or Nations of any part of the World  It were greatly to be wish'd indeed that the Trade to  China  and  India  were in it self a profitable Trade to the rest of  Europe  then the opening these BackDoors or ByChannels might be of some Use to us but as it is I must confess it seems to be nothing but opening a new Passage to let in more Thieves upon us to carry away our ready Money and that neither this  any more than the  Ostend  Company should be allow'd if it could be help'd nor our own be allow'd to bring any Goods but such as are absolutely necessary for our Use and that as to wrought Silks Callicoes printed or plain they should be all entirely expell'd as things utterly inconsistent with the Prosperity of the Linen Woollen and Silk Manufactures not of  England  only but of all the Nations of  Christendom  But to return  By all these great Improvements in Trade we see now the Opulence and Growth of Power in the Empire of  Russia  'Twas indeed the Czar's Conquests upon the unfortunate King of  Sweden  which gave him the Opportunity of launching thus out into Trade and being a Prince of a penetrating Genius he began himself that he might shew his People the Advantages of Commerce Thus he took Tar and some of his richest Furrs and several other Goods all into his own Hands and traded with them infinitely to his own Advantage  Then he erected a Silk Manufacture and having the Silk imported by his own Merchants from  Guilan  caused Manufactures and Men skill'd in working and weaving Broad Silks to be brought from  France  By which he presently found Means to set up the Silk Manufacture and bred his own Subjects to that and other mechanical Employments  Above all he apply'd himself to the Study of the Mathematicks and more particularly of Navigation building and fitting out Ships of War till we saw him his own Admiral at the Head of a Royal Navy whereas he had not one Ship no not a Yacht to set his Foot in when he first came into  England  nor a Port for them to enter if he had had any  Archangel  in the  White Sea  excepted  Now we see his Subjects trading into  Spain  as well as into other Countries with Ships of good Burden and carrying Naval Stores the Product of their own Country into  France Spain Portugal  and  Italy  as well as to  Lubec  and  Hamburg  and other Ports nearer home  Since the Conclusion of the Treaty with  Sweden  call'd the Peace of  Abo  how infinitely are the  Russians  increas'd in Knowledge in Shipping and indeed in Wealth as well as Power and all by Trade and that Trade made flourishing by Peace And if their young Emperor pursues the wise Measures of his Grandfather and encourages the two inseparable Friends PEACE and TRADE he may in time bring the  Muscovites  to be the most powerful Nation in all the Northern World  I might here enlarge upon what I hinted before  viz  That several Nations having lost their Trade by which they were made so  formidable and considerable they have also in proportion sunk in their Strength and lost the Weight they bore in the Scale of Power in  Europe  The  Portuguese  are an eminent Example of this and the  Genoese  both of them in former times very powerful and rich but now much sunk thro' want or neglect of Trade As the  Genoese  lost their Trade first and their Possessions in the  Euxine  Sea afterwards by the Aggression of the  Turks  so likewise they abated in Power and whereas before they could bring a strong Fleet into the  Levant  Sea and disputed even with the  Venetians  themselves now they have not above five or six Gallies and not one Man of War in their keeping so naturally did their Power decline with their Commerce  The same thing may in proportion be observ'd of the  Flemings  in general and the City of  Antwerp  in particular and as I said above of the  Hans Towns  who were once so powerful that they beat and burnt the  Danish  Fleet in plain Fight at Sea and when any War happen'd in that Part of the World whoever had the  Hans  Fleet on their side were sure to conquer But as their Trade supported and indeed form'd all that Power so their Trade declining they are no more a Body their Power is gone and the little Name of a  Hans  or Union of  Merchants which once they had and made such a Figure with is sunk into scarce a Memorial of it in the City of  Lubec  The Inference from all this might be very profitably turn'd upon our selves in the present Conjuncture namely That if we would still enjoy our Wealth and Power our Fame and Glory we must preserve our Trade and to that End as far as we can should preserve the publick Peace also seeing  Peace  and  Trade  are Handmaids to one another  FINIS
