but who sl  w all these  Kings x  INTRODUCTION A judicious Compiler is better than a bad Author  THE BEE AND THE SPIDER FROM DODSLEY'S FABLES  THE Bee and the Spider once entered into a warm de∣bate which was the better artist The Spider urg∣ed her skill in the mathematics and asserted that no one was half so well acquainted as herself with the construc∣tion of lines angles squares and circles that the web she daily wove was a specimen of art inimitable by any other creature in the universe and besides that her works were derived from herself alone the product of her own bowels whereas the boasted honey of the Bee was stolen from every herb and flower of the field nay that  he had obligations even to the meanest weeds To this the Bee replied that she was in hopes the art of extracting honey from the meanest weeds would at least have been allowed her as an excellence and that as to her stealing sweets from the herbs and flowers of the field her skill was therein so conspicuous that no flower ever suffered the least diminution of its fragrance from so delicate an ope∣ration Then as to the Spider's vaunted knowledge in the construction of lines and angles she believed she might safely rest the merits of her cause on the regularity alone of her combs but since she could add this the sweet∣ness and excellence of her honey and the various purposes to which her wax was employed she had nothing to fear from the comparison of her skill with that of the weaver of a flimsy cobweb for the value of every art she observ∣ed is chiefly to be estimated by its use  FROM CATO's LETTERS ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH  SIR  WITHOUT freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech which is the right of every man as far as by it he does not hurt and controul the right of another and this is the only check which it ought to suffer the only bounds which it ought to know  This sacred privilege is so essential to free go∣vernment that the security of property and the freedom of speech always go together and in those wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own he can scarce call any thing else his own Whoever would overthow the liberty of the nation must begin by subduing the liberty of speech a thing terrible to public traitors  This secret was so well known to the court of King Charles the first that his wicked ministry procured a proclamation to forbid the people to talk of parliaments which those traitors had laid aside To assert the undoubted right of the subject and defend his majesty's legal prerogative was called disaffection and punished as sedition Nay people were forbid to talk of religion in their fa∣milies for the priests too had combined to cook up tyranny and suppress truth and the law While the late King James when Duke of York went avowedly to mass men were fined imprisoned and undone for saying he was a papist and that King Charles the second might live more securely a pa∣pist there was an act of parliament made declar∣ing it treason to say that he was one  That men ought to speak well of their governors is true while their governors deserve to be well spoken of but to do public mischief without hear∣ing of it is only the prerogative and felicity of  tyranny a free people will be shewing they are  o by their freedom of speech  The administration of government is nothing else but the attendance of the trustees of the peo∣ple upon the interest and affairs of the people And as it is the part and business of the people for whose sake alone all public matters are or ought to be transacted to see whether they be well or ill transacted so it is the interest and ought to be the ambition of all honest magistrates to have their deeds openly examined and publicly scanned only the wicked governors of men dread what is said of them  Freedom of speech is the great bulwark of liber∣ty they prosper and die together and it is the terror of traitors and oppressors and a barrier against them It produces excellent writers and encourages men of fine genius Tacitus tells us that the Roman commonwealth bred great and nu∣merous authors who wrote with equal boldness and eloquence but when it was enslaved those great wits were no more Tyranny had usurped the place of equality which is the soul of liberty and destroyed public courage The minds of men terrified by unjust power degenerated into all the vileness and methods of servitude abject syco∣phancy and blind submission grew the only means of preferment and indeed of safety men durst not open their mouths but to flatter  Pliny the younger observes that this dread of tyranny had such effect that the senate the great Roman senate became at last stupid and dumb Hence says he our spirit and genius are stupified broken and sunk for ever And in one of his epistles speaking of the works of his uncle he makes an apology for eight of them as not written with the same vigour which was to be found in the rest for that these eight were written in the reign of Nero when the spirit of writing was cramped with fear  I have long thought that the world are very much mistaken in their idea and distinction of li∣bels It has been hitherto generally understood that there are no other libels but those against magis∣trates and those against private men now to me there seems to be a third sort of libels full as de∣structive as any of the former can possibly be I mean libels against the people It was otherwise at Athens and Rome where though particular men and even great men were often treated with much freedom and severity when they deserved it yet the people the body of the people were spoken of with the utmost regard and reverence the sacred privileges of the people the inviolable majesty of the people and the unappealable judg∣ment of the people were phrases common in those wise great and free cities Other modes of speech are since grown fashionable and popular madness is now almost proverbial but this madness of theirs whenever it happens is derived from external causes Oppression they say will make a wise man mad and delusion has not less force but where there are neither oppression nor imposters the judgment of the people in the business of pro∣perty the preservation of which is the principal business of government does rarely err Perhaps they are destitute of grimace mystery reserve and other accomplishments of courtiers but as these are only masks to conceal the absence of honesty and sense the people who possess as they do th  substance have reason to despise such insipid and contemptible shadows  Machiavel in the chapter where he proves that a multitude is wiser and more constant than a prince complains that the credid which the peo∣ple should be in declines daily For says he every man has liberty to speak what he pleases against them but against a prince no man can talk without a thousand apprehensions and dangers I have in∣deed  often wondered that the inveighing against the interest of the people and calling their liber∣ties in question as has been and is commonly done amongst us by old knaves and young fools has never been made an express crime  I must own I know not what treason is if sap∣ping and betraying the liberties of a people be not treason in the eternal and original nature of things Let it be remembered for whose sake government is or could be appointed then let it be consider∣ed who are more to be regarded the governors or the governed they indeed owe one another mu∣tual duties but if there be any transgressions com∣mitted the side that is most obliged ought doubt∣less to bear the most and yet it is so far otherwise that almost all over the earth the people for one injury that they do their governors receive ten thousand from them any in some countries it is made death and damnation not to bear all the oppressions and cruelties which men made wanton by power inflict upon those that gave it them  The truth is If the people are suffered to keep their own it is the most th  t they desire but even that is a happiness which in few places falls to their lot they are frequently robbed by those whom they pay to protect them I know that it is a ge∣neral charge against the people that they are tur∣bulent restless fickle and unruly than which there can be nothing more untrue for they are only so where they are made so As to their being fickle it is so false that on the contrary they have almost ever a strong bent to received customs and as strong a partiality to names and families that they have been used to and as to their being turbulent it is as false since there is scarce and ex∣ample in an hundred years of any people's giving governors any uneasiness till their governors had made them uneasy nay for the most part they bear many evils without returning one and seldom throw off their burdens so long as they can stand under them  From Swift's Sermon on False Witness  A  Second  way by which a man becometh a false witness is when he mixeth falsehood and truth together or concealeth some circumstances which if they were told would destroy the false∣hoods he uttered So the two false witnesses who accused our Saviour before the chief priests by a very little perverting his words would have made him guilty of a capital crime for so it was among the Jews to prophecy any evil against the temple  This fellow said I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it again in three days  Mat xxvi  whereas the words as our Saviour spoke them were to ano∣ther end and differently expressed for when the Jews asked him to shew them a sign he said  De∣stroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up  In such cases as these an innocent man is half confounded and looketh as if he were guilty since he neither can deny his words nor perhaps readily strip them from the malicious additions of a false witness  Thirdly  A man is a false witness when in accusing his neighbour he endeavoureth to aggra∣vate by his gestures and tone of his voice or when he chargeth a man with words which were only repeated o  quoted from somebody else As if any one should tell me that he heard another speak certain dangerous and seditious speeches and I should immediately accuse him for speeking them himself and so drop the only circumstance that made him innocent This was the case of St Stephen The false witnesses said  This man ceas  th not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law  Acts vi  Whereas St Stephen said no such words but only repeated some pro∣phesies of  Jeremiah  or  Malachi  which threatened  Jerusalem  with destruction if it did not repent  However by the fury of the people this innocent holy person was stoned to death for words he ne∣ver spoke  Fourthly  The blackest kind of false witnesses are those who do the offices of the devil by tempting their brethren in order to betray them I cannot call to mind any instances of this kind mentioned in holy scripture but I am afraid this vile practice hath been too much followed in the world When a man's temper hath been so soured by his misfortunes and hard usage that perhaps he hath reason enough to complain then one of these seducers under the pretence of friendship will seem to lament his case urge the hardships he hath suffered and endeavour to raise his passions until he hath said something that a malicious in∣former can pervert or aggravate against him in a court of justice  Fifthly  Whoever beareth witness against his neighbour out of a principle of malice and revenge from any old grudge or hatred to his person such a man is a false witness in the sight of God al∣though what he says be true because the motive or cause is evil not to serve his prince or country but to gratify his own resentments And there∣fore although a man thus accused may be very justly punished by the law yet this doth by no means acquit the accuser who instead of regard∣ing the public service intended only to glut his private rage and spite  Sixthly  I number among false witnesses all those who make a trade of being informers in hope of favour and reward and to this end employ their time either by listening in public places to catch up an accidental word or in corrupting men's servants to discover any unwary expression of their master or thrusting themselves into com∣pany and then using the most indecent scurrilous language fastening a thousand falsehoods and  scandals upon a whole party on purpose to provoke such an answer as they may turn to an accusation And truly this ungodly race is said to be grown so numerous that men of different parties can hardly converse together with any security Even the pulpit hath not been free from the misrepresenta∣tions of these informers of whom the clergy have not wanted occasions to complain with holy  David They daily mistake my words all they imagine is to do me evil  Nor is it any wonder at all that this trade of informing should be now in a flourishing condition since our case is manifestly thus we are divided into two parties with very little cha∣rity or temper toward each other the prevailing side may talk of past things as they please with security and generally do it in the most provok∣ing words they can invent while those who are down are sometimes tempted to speak in favour of a lost cause and therefore without great cau∣tion must needs be often caught tripping and thereby furnish plenty of materials for witnesses and informers  Lastly  Those may well be reckoned among false witnesses against their neighbour who bring him into trouble and punishment by such accusations as are of no consequence at all to the public nor can be of any other use but to create vexation Such witnesses are those who cannot hear an idle intemperate expression but they must immediate∣ly run to the magistrate to inform or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night when they were not able to speak or apprehend three words of common sense will pretend to remember every thing in the morning and think themselves very properly qualified to be accusers of their brethren  It might perhaps be thought proper to have added something by way of advice to those who are unhappily engaged in this abominabe trade and  sin of bearing false witness but I am far from be∣lieving or supposing any of that destructive tribe are now my hearers I look upon them as a sort of people that seldom frequent these holy places where they can hardly pick up any materials to serve their turn unless they think it worth their while to misrepresent or pervert the words of the preacher and whoever is that way disposed I doubt cannot be in a very good condition to edify and reform himself by what he heareth God in his mercy preserve us all from the guilt of this grievous sin forbidden in my text  Exod xx Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour  and from the snares of those who are guilty of it  I shall conclude with one or two precepts given by  Moses  from God to the children of Israel in the xxiii of  Exod    Thou shalt not raise a false report put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment  Now to God the father c  SOME CAUSES OF ENGLISH MISERY  BY SMOLLET  NOTWITHSTANDING the improvements the capital is become an overgrown monster which like a dropsical head will in time leave the body and extremities without nourishment and sup∣port The absurdity will appear in it full force when we consider that one sixth part of the natives of this whole extensive kingdom is crowded with∣in the bills of mortality  What wonder that our villages are depopulated and our farms in want of day labours The aboli∣tion of small farms is but one cause of the decrease  of population Indeed the incredible increase of horses and black cattle to answer the purposes of luxury requires a prodegious quantity of hay and grass which are raised and managed without much labour but a number of hands will always be want∣ed for the different branches of agriculter whe∣ther the farms be large or small The tide of lux∣ury has swept all the inhabitants from the open countrythe poorest squire as well as the richest peer must have his house in town and make a figure with an extraordinary number of domestics The plough boys' cow herds and lower kinds are debauched and seduced by the appearance and discourse of those coxcombs in livery when they make their summer excurtions they desert their dirt and drudgery and swarm up to London in hopes of getting into service where they can live luxuriously and wear fine cloaths without being obliged to work for idleness is natural to man Great numbers of those being disappointed in their expectation become thieves and sharpers  ON THE EXECUTION OF LOUIS CAPAT From a Pamphlet entitled  "Peace and Union"  By William Friend  M A  LOUIS CAPET has afforded an excellent to∣pick for parliamentary declamation Let us strip the subject of figures of rhetorick and no Englishman need be alarmed at the execution of and individual at Paris Louis Capet was once King of France and entitled to the honours of that exalted station The supreme power of the nation declared that France should be a Republic from that moment Louis Capet lost his titles He was accused of enormous crimes confined as a state prisoner tried by the National Convention found guilty condemned and executed What  is there wonderful in all this Our revolution the boast of the present days pursued the same con∣duct as nearly as possible Our Convention de∣clared that James the Second should be no longer king it did not chuse to abolish kingship but dignified William the Third with regal honours James was stripped of his titles and became plain James Stuart and the rebublican William became a sovereign James was not tried condemned and executed because he saved his life by flight but the laws against himself and his son and the proceedings in the years fifteen and fortyfive must convince the most superficial reasoner that the maxims of the English and French nations with respect to the dethroning of kings are ex∣actly the same But some one will say Louis Capet was unjustly condemned Ninetynine out of a hundred who make this objection have not given themselves the trouble of examining the records of the trial and why should I give greater credit to the remaining objector than to the ver∣dict of the court If Louis Capet did when king encourage the invasion of his country however we may be inclined to pity the unfortunate man for the error of his conduct we have no right to proclaim him innocent in pomt of law It is in short no business of ours and if all the crowned heads in the continent are taken off it is no busi∣ness of ours We should be unworthy of the constitution settled at the revolution and enemies to the Brunswick families now seated on our throne if we denied to any nation the right of settling as it pleased its own internal government These sentiments do not prevent us from com∣miserating the situation of the French refugees They are entitled to our compassion and it is but right that we should attend to their distresses since foreign countries have been put to the ex∣pence of maintaining those refugees from our own  island who for their attachment to an ancient fa∣mily were by the rigour of the two foreign reigns subjected to all the penalties exacted from recusant by the present government in France  ON POLITICAL SUPERSTITION  From Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders  THERE is another consideration from which we may argue the total extinction of wars as a necessary consequence of establishing governments on the representative wisdom of the people We are all sensible that superstition is a blemish of hu∣man nature by no means confined to subjects con∣nected with religion Political superstition is al∣most as strong as religious and it is quite as uni∣versally used as an instrument of tyranny To enumerate the variety of ways in which this in∣strument operates on the mind would be more difficult than to form a general idea of the result of its operations In monarchies it induces men to spill their blood for a particular family or for a particu∣lar branch of that family who happens to have been born first or last or to have been taught to repeat a certain creed in preference to other creeds But the effect which I am going chiefly to notice is that which respects the territorial boundaries of a government For a man in Portugal of Spain to prefer belonging to one of those nations rather than the other is as much superstition as to prefer the house of Braganza to that of Bourbon or Mary the second of England to her brother All these subjects of preference stand upon the same footing as the turban and the hat the cross and the crescent or the lily and the rose  The boundaries of nations have been fixed for the accommodation of the  government  without the least regard to the convenience of the people Kings  and ministers who make a profitable trade of go∣verning are interested in extending the limits of their dominion as far as possible They have a property in the people and in the territory that they cover The country and its inhabitants are to them a farm stocked with sheep When they call up these sheep to be sheared they teach them to know their names to follow their master and avoid a stranger By this unaccountable imposition it is that men are led from one extravagant folly to anotherto adore their king to boast of their nation and to wish for conquestcircumstances equally ridiculous in themselves and equally in∣comp  table with that rational estimation of things which arises from the science of liberty  FROM MERRY's ODE  For the  th  of July    HAVE kings and nobles  rights  alone

FEW  The Effects of War on the Poor  From Mr Frend's Pamphlet entitled "Peace and Union"  THREE days after the debate on the king's mes∣sage I was walking from my friend's house to the neighbouring town to inspect the printing of these few sheets and in my way joined company with two men of the village who being employed by the Woolstaplers to let out spinning to the poor had lately received orders to lower the value of labour We were talking on this subject when the exclamations of a groupe of poor women going to market overhearing our conversation made an impression on my mind which all the eloquence of the Houses of Lords and Commons cannot efface We are to be sconced three pence in the shilling let others work for me I'll not We are to be sconced a fourth part of our labour What is all this for I did not dare to tell them what it was for nor to add insult to misery What is the be∣heading of a monarch to them What is the navi∣gation of the Scheldt to them What is the free∣dom of a great nation to them but reason for joy Yet the debating only on these subjects has reached their cottages They are already sconced threepence in the shilling What must be their fate when we suffer under the most odious scourge of the human race and the accumulation of taxes takes away half of that daily bread which is scarce suffi∣cient at present for their support  Oh that I had the warning voice of an ancient Prophet that I might penetrate into the inmost re∣cesses  of palaces and appal the harranguers of se∣nates I would use no other language than that of the poor marketwomen I would cry aloud in the ears of the first magistrate We are sconced threepence in the shilling the fourth part of our labour for what I would address myself to the deliberat∣ing bodies We are sconced three pence in the shilling the fourth part of our labour for what Is there a man that could stand out against this elo∣quence Yes Thousands Threepence in the shilling for spinning conveys no ideas to them They know not what a cottage is they know not how the poor live how they make up their scanty meal Perhaps there may be some one in our House of Commons whose feelings are in union with mine communicate them to your colleagues im∣press them with the horror attendant on their deli∣berations tell them what the deduction of threepence in the shilling occasions among the myriads of England And should any grave courtier pity∣ing the distresses of the poor be anxious to relieve them say to him There is an easy method let the first magistrate the peers the representatives of the people the rich men of the nation all who are for war be sconced one fourth part of their an∣nual income to defray the expence of it Let them be the first sufferers let the burden fall on them not on the poor Alas my poor countrymen how many years calamity awaits you before a single dish or a glass of wine will be withdrawn from the ta∣bles of opulence  At this moment perhaps the decree is gone forth for war Let others talk of glory let others celebrate the heroes who are to deluge the world with bloodthe words of the poor marketwomen will still resound in my earsWe are sconced threepence in the shilling one fourth of our labour For what  A Prognostic of the French Revolution CHESTERFIELD TO HIS SON  London  April    O S    I Received this moment your letter of the th N S with the enclosed pieces relative to the present dispute between the king and the parliament I shall return them by Lord Huntingdon whom you will soon see at Paris and who will likewise carry you the piece which I forgot in making up the packet I sent you by the Spanish Ambassador The representation of the parliament is very well drawn  suavitor in modo fortiter in re  They tell the king very respectfully that in a certain case  which they should think it criminal to suppose  they would not obey him This hath a tendency to what we call here revolution principles I do not know what the Lord's anointed his vicegerent upon earth divinely appointed by him and accountable to none but him for his actions will either think or do upon these symptoms of reason and good sense which seem to be breaking out all over France but this I foresee that before the end of this century the trade of both king and priest will not be half so good a one as it has been Du Clos in his Reflections hath observed and very truly  qu'il y a un germe rasion qui commence â se dêveloper en France  A  developpement  that must prove fatal to regal and papal pretensions Prudence may in many cases recommend an occasional submission to either but when that ignorance upon which an implicit faith in both could only be founded is once re∣moved God's vicegerent and Christ's vicar will only be obeyed and believed as far as what the one orders and the other says is conformable to reason and truth  A LESSON FOR ANTIGALLICANS  Extracts from a pamphlet enti  led "A Tour through the Theatre of War in the Months of November and December    and January    "  THERE is a vice in the civil polity of al∣most every state in Europe that is ne∣cessarily the parent of revolution creating all the miseryand crimes that afflict the great mass of mankind and driving them to insurrection as a last resource The government draws the money out of the pockets of the poor to give it under the denomination of places and pensions to the rich The rich avail themselves of this to accumulate property till at last their colossal stride reaches from province to province and the whole land that seems the birth right of the community is mono∣polized by a few individuals The rest of the na∣tion is then left at their mercy and both the know∣ledge of mankind and experience prove that the rest of the nation have nothing to hope for at their hands but what they can obtain by making  their own  subservient to the support the luxury and the pleasure of their lordly masters who always take care that the salary of their day's labour shall be precisely enough to supply rest and strength for the labours of the next Thus are they reduced to more working automata with neither the means nor leisure necessary to acquire instruction or to soften their manners to social intercourse and enjoyments and thus is the human species degraded The evil by a necessary progression grows greater for the number of rich growing smaller proportion as the most wealthy swallow up the rest the demand for labour becomes less while the competition for employment increases A harder bargain is conse∣quently made till at last the point of sufferance is past the boast of burden kicks the load off his back turns to a beast of prey tears every thing he meets with to pieces and takes a blind and furious ven∣geance  for all the oppression he has suffered Of this continued the Frenchinan with a sigh my country is a lamentable example  After this monopoly of landed property the grand source of human vices and misfortunes the greatest scourge that can afflict a people is an exten∣siv  foreign commerce If by the nation be under∣stood a few merchants ship owners ship's husbands brokers bankers manufact  re  s and fiscal officers the nation is indeed prosperous when trade is in a thriving state But if by the nation we may be al∣lowed to understand all those not comprised in the above description that is to say at least ninetenths of the community the case is the reverse It is self evident that foreign commerce can only con∣sist of exportation and importation  less indeed where a people should be merely brokers and car∣riers for others It is equally evident that a coun∣try can only export what is produced by the labour of its inhabitants on the soil or by their drudgery in manufactures If then no part of what is im∣ported comes to the share of those who drudge and toil can it be denied that they give up ease plenty and leisure for nothing that the necessaries of life the enjoyments and repose of the many are sacrificed to feed the luxury of the few What a noble export trade does Ireland carry on in beef pork butter and flour Well what does the na∣tion at large that live in that fertile country get in return The advantage of never lasting meat bread or butter of feed  ng on potatoes and buttermilk and sleeping among the litter of their pigs all which their  noble landlords  while drinking French wines and wearing French silks assure us is  vastly  conducive to their health Oh but in some other countries those who furnish all the exports obtain a small portion of the returns Yes from America a noxious and intoxicating weed an enervating drink from Asia and from the other parts of Eu∣rope liquid poisons that do indeed for a moment  make them forget the sacrifice they cost  This evil is the offspring of the former for if property were divided with any tolerable equality a man would begin by providing amply for his sup∣port comfort and enjoyment and would only suffer the surplus to be exchanged for foreign su∣perfluities nor would he for superfluities con∣demn himself to incessant labour I have made an exact calculation continued he and I find that four hours of work in a day in our temperate cli∣mates would suffice for the subsistence of a man and his family Those that remain would afford him leisure for instruction and reflection and it would then become impossible for such men to be imposed upon by the cant of a few interested indi∣viduals who assure them that the nation has reach∣ed the highest pitch of prosperity because they themselves have obtained every gratification o  not and luxury that they can devise But to keep men ignorant you must make them work and to make them work you must keep them ignorant This is the eternal circle in which rolls the torrent of abuse I have often heard it said that Heaven made some for enjoyment and some for toil I con∣fess that I cannot myself see why those who do nothing should have all and why those who do all should have nothing  He hold a number of political tenets more ex∣traordinary still He said when wars were declar∣ed by the caprice or for the interests of kings that kings alone should fight the battles that i  a na∣tion at large were consulted hostilities would rare∣ly occur that a country should never engage in a war in defence of a state on which it is found it cannot depend for defence that a minister who should attempt to embroil his country for futile or insufficient reasons should be sent abroad to fulfil in person the engagements he might have made that the best way to prevent wars would be for every one to understand the use  which is  indeed the bounden duty of every freeman for without the means of resisting oppression who can fla  ter himself that he is freeA large state would then be unattackable and the fee simple of a small one would not be worth the conquest  He said that magistrates who should assume no improper power could never be afraid of its being wrested out of their hand and that the majori  y of a nation has a right to a bad government upon the absurd supposition of its chusing such a one in preference to a good one's b  ing thrust down their throats But these and many other of his strange opinions I forbear to mention lest I should expose my new acquaintance to the censure of  Those wholesale c  tics that in Coffee  Houses cry down all philosophy  All along the road from Calais to Dunkirk from Dunkirk to Lisle add from Lisle to Valenciennes we hardly saw a man that had not assumed some thing of a military garb and appearance Some had a sword and belt thrown over their shoulder some had a feather in their hats and some were fully accoutred In a word or rather in the words of Shakespeare we found them  All furnish'd all in arms  All plum'd like est  id  es  The diligence with which they were practising the military exercise in many places and the hear∣tiness in the cause that they expressed in all would have sufficed to convince us that the idea many people in England affect to entertain of a small faction domineering it over the whole nation was totally destitute of foundation had any proof been wanting to overthrow an opinion so indefensible How is it possible for a small part to oppress the whole when all are armed Yes but the party averse to the revolutionists though the most nume∣rous are afraid to shew themselvesWhy then what a wretched opinion must they have of their  cause or what sorry dastards must they be How∣ever to "make assurance doubly sure" I conversed with numbers of people of all ranks on my way and found them with very few exceptions agreed upon the great principle of liberty They fre∣quently lamented that many unwise steps had been taken by their representatives and reprobated the infamous crimes of particular factions but they considered them at the same time as partial and accidental abuses of a system generally and essenti∣ally good Here and there I met with a man who openly regretted the old government nor was it a little remarkable that the greatest aristocrats I heard speak of politics were employed by the new go∣vernment in the civil and military line Let it however be remembered that the Department of the north is one of those the most suspected of ari∣stocracy  On December th we set off for Brussels Desi∣rous of not meeting with the same difficulties in our way that we had experienced in coming from Va∣lenciennes we hi  e  i an excellemt carriage with four horses This was the more necessary as we did not leave Mons till the morning was far advanced We found the roads entirely covered with convoys going to the army with detachments of troops and with straggling soldiers trudging on to join their respective regiments  A thaw had lately taken place the carriages de∣prived them of the benefit of the pavement and they were obliged to wade through mud half way up their legs Yet still their native gaiety support∣ed them and on they went singing  ca ira  and other patriotic tunes We took up behind us two of th  se that seemed the most tired It is only giv∣ing a florin or two more to the coachman said my companion and sleeping in the superbs instead of the town A little further on as we were going slowly up a hill I saw a young lad walking very  lame and losing his shoe at every moment in the mud As he did not call upon pestilence and the devil to run away with them and the road into the bargain I was sure he could not be a French∣man although he had the national uniform on his back We asked him if he also would get up be∣hind and he joyfully accepted our offer But as the weather was cold and he seemed weakly we soon after found means to make room for him in our carriage I then asked him if he had been wounded  Dieu merci  he had only been cut down at the battle of Jemappe and then wounded in the foot while lying on the ground which was the reason of his walking so lame I told him he was too young to run such hazards and bear the fatigues of a military life Too young said he with a proud smile that ill concealed a little indignation too young why I am now nineteen and near three years ago was shot through the body in the Belgic war He added that at the beginning of the present campaign he had been ill of a fever that he had been sent to the hospital at Maubeuge that in the time of his convalescence he had walked out with some of his comrades that they had fallen in with a party of French who were engaged with the ene∣my at Grisoelle that he had taken up a dead man's musket to have his shot  tout comme un autre  and that a ball from the rifle gun of a Tyrolian chasseur had hit him in the neck  When I enquired into the motives of his taking up arms he said he had been on the side of the pa∣triots before and had heard that they were up again and so he had l  ft his home at Namur where he had a father a mother and a little sister  assez aim∣able  and he would leave them again as soon as it should please God and the blessed Virgin to cure the lameness of his foot for a patriot should always fight for his country and should not mind a wound or two or a little pain in a good cause I am now  going to Brussels said he to see some relations I have thereGo where thou wilt said I to myself thou art a brave youth and not only a patriot but a philosopher although  I  verily believe thou dost not know the meaning of the word  Gaiety was ever the Frenchman's birthright but never was it so strongly exhibited as since they have been animated by the spirit of Patriotism This cheerfulness is always accompanied by another cha∣racteristic of the nation an uncommon degree of carelessness and disregard of danger In the plains of Champaigne the two armies were often in sight and almost within shot of each other At such times there stood the Prussians menacing a charge in re∣gular array with supported arms and motionless as statues and here were the French dancing in rings around their fires and broiling their meat on the points of their bayonets  On a march woe to the game that gets up be∣fore them a hundred soldiers are sure to send after it the contents of their muskets not without dan∣ger of shooting their comrades Even the presence of the enemy is insufficient to correct this deviation from discipline It once happened as a battalion of volunteers was advancing to the attack in the momentary expectation of receiving and returning the enemy's fire that they trod up a solitary hare As she run along the line she was saluted with an universal shout and with a shot or two at least from every company she passed The fugitive however escaped it being no easy matter to kill so small an animal with a single ball  The old animosity and false point of honour that used to set regiment against regiment and man against man and that were supposed every year to cost the state the lives of five hundred soldiers are so much forgot that a duel is now a thing of very unfrequent occurrence It was predicted that endless dissensions and jealousies  would embroil the regular troops with the national guards but these fears were so ill founded that it is impossible to conceive an army living in more univer∣sal harmony than that of Dumourier At public and private tables nothing is more common than to see the shoulderknot of a grenadier touching the epaulet of a Colonel nor does this vicinage seem to surprise either party The one shews no haughtiness the other no servility and both interchange upon equal terms the salutation of  Citizen  or Comrade Though a stranger may be startled at it at first his wonder di∣minishes when he finds that not a few of the common national volunteers are men of property some of them possessing ten twenty and thirty thousand livres a year Many of those I spoke with supported well the national character of politeness but they had discarded the frivolous flippancy that was but too frequently its companion They assumed no credit for their cou∣rage spoke of their giving up ease and comfort to encounter the danger and hardships of a military life as only discharging a debt they owed to their coun∣try lamented its being desolated by war and faction and vowed to see their enemies humbled or to sleep in the dust I listened to them with admiration and God and Mr Burke forgive me I thought I should have disgraced them by a comparison with the de∣funct chivalry of France  Many of the officers many even of the superior ranks have been raised from that of a private soldier In a ball or drawingroom they would no doubt make an aukward figure but surely after a long ap∣prenticeship to war they are as fit to lead a company or a battalion into the fire as a giddy and beardless boy just broke loose from the military school  Republican severity is by degrees removing that foppishness in dress and manners that sprung from the example of a frivolous court The small sword that formerly dangled at the side of the French of∣ficers and soldiers has resigned its place to a weighty sabre The threecornered hat that sheltered them neither from rain sun nor blows is very generally  changed into a helmet Their hair far the most part cut short is in the state nature gave it and many of their whiskers grow unchecked by the razor The whole of their dress in short bespeaks more attention to utility than show Some of their new corps must however be excepted particularly the legion of the celebrated St George This is a body of seven hun∣dred men composed of Creoles Negroes and Mu∣lattoes and is dressed and accoutred in the richest and most brilliant manner  I dined one day in company with a black captain of horse and judged this new Othello to be worthy of his occupation His easy and polite manners de∣served and met with the respect and attention of a great number of officers that were present As for me it did me good to see the general fraternity of mankind so nobly established and convinced me that all the worthless parts of the human race are only so because debased by their political institutions  Till I came to Liege I never could give entire be∣lief to the wonderful effects said to have been pro∣duced by the music of the ancients How is it possi∣ble I used to say that among the multitude of our instruments and the endless variety of our compo∣sitions one of those moving sounds or powerful pas∣sages should never yet have been hit upon But when I came to Liege the struggle between my faith and my reason was at an end I thought I discovered that those enthusiastic emotions were not excited in the Greeks by the mechanical operation of "a con∣cord of sweet sounds" but by the subject of their lays the circumstances they stood in and the dispo∣sition of their minds In their old popular govern∣ments glory and duty went hand in hand and the persecution of their liberty called forth the fanati∣cism of freedom Such is the situation of the French and such are their feelings as I had an opportunity of observing at the dinner I have just mentioned While we were at table some itinerant musicians were ad∣mitted I need not say that their music vocal and instrumental was far from being of an excellent kind  It was nevertheless astonishing to see the effect the Marseilles Hymn produced upon the company When they came to the passage  aux armes Citoyens  all the French officers joined them in concert most untune∣able indeed but with very forcible expression Some of them stood up erect in military attitude grasping their swords and I saw tears trickle down faces as hard as iron In my early youth I had felt much of the martial  mania  myself but my long vacancy from warlike occupation since the last peace had given time to reason to take the place of sentiment and cold calculations of safety and repose had damped if not extinguished all military ardour The contagion however reached me I repeated  aux armes  with the rest and felt that I was again become a soldier  This valour at table is well maintained in the field If I had only the bare word of the French for it I should not fail to make a large abatement for this selfpraise Credit however cannot be refused to the universal testimony of the natives of the country who speak with artless wonder of what they call the  rage  of the new republicans This bravery is the more meritorious as a large proportion of their sol∣diers are boys But they are boys according to the words of our favourite dramatist "with ladies' faces and fierce dragon's spleen"  During the whole of the journey we remarked that the apprehension of a war with England was peculiarly painful to the French Though flushed with their late successes and "confident against a world in arms" it was evident there was nothing they dreaded more than such an event not merely on account of the mischief that might ensue but be∣cause it would force them to regard as enemies the only nation in Europe they considered as their friends  All along the road they anxiously asked us what we thought would be the consequence of the arma∣ment in England We frankly told them we pre∣sumed it would be war and generally observed a mo∣ment  of silence and dejection follow the delivery of our opinion But soon bristling up at the aspect of new dangers several of them said"Well if all the world be determined to fight with us we will fight with all the world We can be killed but once  The imminence of hostilities however diminished in no degree the respect they shewed us as English∣men and not only we did not meet with any thing like an insult in the whole of our tour but on the contrary we experienced every where particular kind∣ness and attention They seemed eagerly to court our good opinion and frequently begged us not to ascribe to a whole nation the faults of individuals and not to charge their government with disorders its present state of vacillation rendered it incompe∣tent to repress If there was any disputing such high authorities as Mr Burke and the collective wisdom of the kings of the continent I confess I should never have suspected that I was travelling among a nation of savages madmen and assassins I should rather have wished with Shakespeare  that these contending kingdoms  England and France whose very shores look pale  With envy of each other's happiness  May cease their hatred  that never war advance  Her bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France  That English may as French French Englishmen  Receive each other  They looked upon Louis XVI as a tyrant and a traitor who had brought a disastrous war upon their country Though a king they considered him as no more than another man And let us Britons  penitus ab orbe divisi  who have a special privilege for judging better of what passes all over the world than all the world pity this lamentable mistake Let us be the more indulgent as the superior beings expressed no particular concern The Heavens did not shed a tear no earthly convulsion rent the veil  of the Temple nor did the thunder rolling on the left of the guilty city reprobate the atrocity of the action  Nay in proportion as our feelings are sensibly affected at the death of a king we have so few of us seen let us make some allowance for the feelings of others The minds of the Parisians were peculiarly irritated Thousands of them had lost their dearest friends and their nearest relatives in the bloody seenes of which the deceased monarch had been the wilful or the occasional cause and they all saw their country invested by cruel and innumerable foes who were come with the declared intention of reinstating him in his former despotism and who asserted that he was the insidious accomplice of their hostile attack  The same deeds done in different circumstances may stand as wide asunder as the poles The killing of a man from whom we have received no offence or upon strong provocation constitutes in the first case a horrible crime in the second a fault that may admit of excuse Considered in this point of view even the sanguinary scenes of the beginning of September may allow some little extenuation Let no man imagine that I mean in any degree to justify what I have never yet suffered with patience a French∣man to defend My blood has ever been chilled by the horrid recital nor have I a dearer wish than to see the instigators and preformers of these base and atrocious actions punished as they deserve But it is not the less true that the Parisians were driven to despair by the Duke of Brunswick's approach to Paris and by his infamous manifestoes Bouille's threat of not leaving stone upon stone in the capital was back∣ed by the menaces of the Emigrants Their cruel conduct on the frontiers plainly showed the inhabitants of Paris what they had to expect When the whole strength of the city rose to repel the enemy they feared that they should leave their aged fathers and their defenceless children to the mercy of a band of conspirator of which the part that was in the prisons  was to be set at liberty by their accomplices with∣out  Be this true or false it is certain that such was their persuasion and I have been assured by a re∣spectable French merchant who mixed without par∣ticipating in these horrid scenes that all the prisoners had received a day or two before stockings striped blue and white to enable them to recognize each other Their being in this uniform he said he could attest from his own observation The nobles and the priests had also their distinctive marks If I could doubt the assertions of numbers who pretend to have seen these marks I could not easily reject the testi∣mony of a youth too ingenuous to deceive and too young to invent who was present at the massacre in the Convent of Carmelite Friars He says that he saw cards taken from the breasts of the murdered priests on which were depicted a royal crown and a crown of thorns with the words  Regiment de Salomon  written above and below  miserere nostri  Why then should an event enchained with so many incidents and circumstances be considered as the natural con∣sequence of the revolution Those who affect to look upon it in this light and who would fain make it an argument for the extermination of the new principles of liberty are not aware that while the Saint Bar∣tholomew in France and the massacre of protestants in Ireland scenes of blood far less provoked and of much greater extent are upon record they are not aware I say that their bold conclusion involves the condemnation of the christian religion and the pro∣scription of all kings  But admitting that the page of history was never so fouly stained before this is so far from being a reason for bringing the French under the yoke of their old despotism that it is the strongest argument that can be found for letting them try the experiment of a new government As the cruelty with which they are re∣proached has marked their conduct from the first day of the revolution it is evident that their old govern∣ment made them what they are for who will believe  that there is any thing in the kindly climate or grate∣ful soil of France to render its inhabitants serocious or that the taking of the Bastile instilled this sudden venom into their souls It is indeed little to be won∣dered at that a people treated like brutes for so many centuries should become like brutes when they broke their chain  It may perhaps be safer in this christian land for the man who rejoiced that there were prisons for the libellers of a queen to libel a whole nation and to advise the cutting of his fellowcreatures throats from generation to generation than it is for another to inculcate charity to our neighbours by a candid statement of facts and demonstrable truth But as my tour induced me to relate the things I saw and as these things led me naturally to the reflections that accompany the mention of them I defy reproach and trust that my readers will shew some indulgence to the hasty production of an unskilful pen  ON THE EXCELLENCY OF A FREE GO∣VERNMENT AND ITS TENDENCY TO EXALT THE NATURE OF MAN  By  Dr Price  EVERY Member of a Free State having his pro∣perty secure and knowing himself his own go∣vernor possesses a consciousness of dignity in himself and feels incitements to emulation and improvement to which the miserable slaves of arbitrary power must be utter strangers In such a state all the springs of action have room to operate and the mind is stimu∣lated to the noblest exertions But to be obliged from our birth to look up to a creature no better than ourselves as the master of our fortunes and to  receive his will as our lawWhat can be more hu∣miliating What elevated ideas can enter a mind in such a situationAgreeably to this remark the subjects of free states have in all ages been most di∣stinguished for genius and knowledge Liberty is the soil where the arts and sciences have flourished and the more free a state has been the more have the powers of the human mind been drawn forth into action and the greater number of BRAVE men has it produced With what lustre do the ancient free states of  Greece  shine in the annals of the world How different is that country now under the Great Turk The difference between a country inhabited by men and by brutes is not greater  These are reflections which should be constantly present to every mind in this country As  moral  liberty is the prime blessing of man in his  private  ca∣pacity so is  civil  liberty in his  public  capacity There is nothing that requires more to be  w  hed  than power There is nothing that ought to be opposed with a more determined resolution than its  roach∣ments Sleep in a state as  Montesquien  says is always followed by slavery  The people of this kingdom were once warmed by such sentiments as these Many a sycophant of power have they sacrificed Often have they fought and bled in the cause of Liberty But that time seems to be going The fair inheritance of liberty left us by our ancestors many of us are not unwilling to resign An unbounded venality the inseparable companion of dissipation and extravagance has poi∣soned the springs of public virtue among us and should any events ever arise that should render the same opposition necessary that took place in the times of King  Charles  the First and  James  the Second I am afraid all that is valuable to us would be lost  The terror of the standing army the danger of the pub∣lic funds and the allcorrupting influence of the treasury would deaden all zeal and produce general acquiescence and servility  A LAMENTATION FOR THE OPPRESSED  From the  Deserted Village  SWEET smiling Village loveliest of the lawn  Thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn  Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen  And desolation saddens all the green  One only master grasps the whole domain  And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain  No more thy glassy brook reflects the day  But choak'd with sedges works its weedy way  Along thy glades a solitary guest  The hollow sounding bittern guards its nest  Amidst thy desart walks the lapwing flies  And tires their echoes with unvaried cries  Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all  And the long grass o'ertops the mould'ring wall  And trembling shrinking from the spoiler's hand  Far far away thy children leave the land  Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey  Where wealth accumulates and men decay  Princes and lords may flourish or may fade  A breath can make them as a breath has made  But a bold peasantry their country's pride  When once destroy'd can never be supplied  A time there was ere England's griefs began  When every rood of ground maintain'd its man  For him light labour spread her wholesome store  Just gave what life required but gave no more  His best companions innocence and health  And his best riches ignorance of wealth  But times are alter'd trade's unfeeling train  Usurp the land and dispossess the swain  Along the lawn where scattered hamlets rose  Unweildy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose  And every want to opulence allied  And every pang that folly pays to pride  These gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom  Those calm desires that ask'd but little room  Those healthful sports that grac'd the peaceful scene▪  Liv'd in each look and brighten'd all the green  These far departing seek a kinder shore  And rural mirth and manners are no more  Yes let the rich deride the proud disdain  These simple blessings of the lowly train  To me more dear congenial to my heart  One native charm than all the gloss of art  Spontaneous joys where nature has its play  The soul adopt and owns their firstborn sway  Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind  Unenvied unmolested unconfin'd  But the long pomp the midnight masquerade  With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd  In these ere trifles half their wish obtain  The toiling pleasure sickens into pain  And even while fashions brightest arts decoy  The heart distrusting asks if this be joy  Ye friends to truth ye statesmen who survey  The rich man's joys encrease the poor's decay  Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand  Between a splendid and an happy land  Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore  And snouring folly hails them from her shore  Hoards even beyond the miser's wish abound  And rich men flock from all the world around  Yet count our gains This wealth is but a name  That leaves our useful products still the same  Not so the loss The man of wealth and pride  Takes up a space that many poor supplied  Space for his lake his parks extended bounds  Space for his horses equipage and hounds  The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth  Has robb'd the neighbouring fields of half their growth  His seat where solitary sports are seen  Indignant spurns the cottage from the green  Around the world each needful product flies  For all the luxuries the world supplies  While thus the land adorn'd for pleasure all  In barren splendor feebly waits the fall  As some fair female unadorn'd and plain  Secure to please while youth confirms her reign  Slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies  Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes  But when those charms are past for charms are frail  When time advances and when lovers fail  She then shines forth solicitous to bless  In all the glaring impotence of dress  Thus fares the land by luxury betrayed  In nature's simplest charmes at first arrayed  But verging to decline its splendors rife  Its vistas strike its palaces surprize  While scourg'd by famine from the smiling land  The mournful peasant leads his humble band  And while he sinks without one arm to save  The country bloomsa garden and a grave  Where then ah where shall poverty reside  To scape the pressure of contiguous pride  If to some common's fenceless limits stray'd  He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade  Those fenceless fields the sons of whealth divide  And even the bareworn common is denied  If to the city spedWhat waits him there  To see profusion that he must not share  To see ten thousand baneful arts combin'd  To pamper luxury and thin mankind  To see those joys the sons of pleasure know  Extorted from his fellowcreatures' woe  Here where the courtier glitters in brocade  There the pale artist plies the sickly trade  Here while the proud their longdawn pomps display  There the black gibbet glooms beside the way  The dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign  Here richly deck'd admits the gorgeous train  Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square  The rattling chariots clash the torches glare  Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy  Sure these denote one universal joy  Are these thy serious thoughtsAh turn thine eyes  Where the poor houseless shivering female lies  She once perhaps in village plenty blest  Has wept at tales of innocence distrest  Her modest looks the cottage might adorn  Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn  Now lost to all her friends her virtue sled  Near her betrayer's door she lays her head  And pinch'd with cold and shrinking from the shower  With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour  When idly first ambitious of the town  She left her wheel and robes of country brown  ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KINGS  From  THE CANDID PHILOSOPHER  I ONCE thought that in point of morals the ac∣tions of all men however distinguished in rank stood on the same footing and were entitled to the same praise or censure I thought that the morality of a monarch and of a private man as prescribed by the same divine authority were exactly the same But I find the world thinks otherwise The world thinks that what is fit and just in a subject is not so in a king that a king is not bound by those narrow rules that were only intended to bind the vulgar herd and that a king may commit actions which though highly criminal in a subject are not so in him Owing to these opinions a political and prac∣tical system has been drawn by acute statesmen and metaphysical lawyers in which among other equally judicious principles they lay it down as a rule that though in the case of a subject the master is answer∣able for the ill conduct of his servants yet in the case of a sovereign he is not responsible for the errors and misconduct of his ministers▪ So far from it  they  are accountable for  his  misconduct and errors if such  he  could  commit for they say he cannot They say he is not a FREE AGENT but a  more machine  and as such can  do no wrong  therefore can do no right the reason of this they tell us is that the king is always supposed to be advised by his ministers and there∣fore to imagine he was capable of doing injustice or was to be made responsible for his actions would be to destroy his independence This is paying the king but a very  scorbutic  compliment To represent him as a  machine  and the  mouthpiece  of his ministers is treat∣ing him as an idiot or a puppet moved by wires And with respect to the  independency  they want to ascribe to the king I insist on it they rob him of it entirely ac∣cording to their system and render him the most ab∣ject pitiful dependent creature imaginable dependent on the nod the wink the command of his servants They make him a very child in leading strings unfit to walk himself but to be led blindfold wherever his tutors shall be pleased to drag him Whether this is the case in reality with any king now living I pre∣sume not to say but it has been the case of multitudes whom HISTORY has damned to everlasting infamy in her fair and impartial page If in a point of this delicate nature I may dare to hazard an opinion I would say that I think a king I mean of Utopia not of England ought to be personally responsible for his misconduct as much as a private man is for his that a king ought to be responsible for his misconduct in choosing igno∣rant or wicked ministers That though a king takes the advice of others yet as advice does not bind his conduct he is as much accountable for it as the  pri∣vate  malefactor would be in taking and pursuing the ill advice of his comrades to rob or murder  FROM THE SAME ROMAN PATRIOTISM FOUNDED ON INJUSTICE AND THE RUIN OF MANKIND  THE patriotism of ancient Rome has been much extolled by modern writers but I think unjustly Her patriotism was founded on the most flagrant in∣justice and iniquity and therefore deserved not so much to be called patriotism as a desire to render Rome the mistress of the universe  For this purpose she scrupled not committing all manner of tyrannous and wicked acts against the li∣berties of mankind Her feverish fondness for uni∣versal empire laid desolate all the known world The possessions the habitations the paintings the sculp∣tures all the riches of the Romans were the spoils of plundered nations Thus they erected to them∣selves an empire as unwieldy as it was unjust on the ruins of their fellow creatures What then are all their beautiful lectures and pompous declamations on the love of their country What their laboured ora∣tions in praise of LIBERTY Indisputable proofs indeed of their eloquence but not of their humanity If the language of benevolence were to constitute the character we must allow it is due to these Romans but if actions are to afertain the right and to be con∣sidered as the criterion of justice we shall find it a dif∣ficult matter to make good their claim though we were masters of eloquence equal to their own  A DESCRIPTION OF ENGLAND  From the  LETTERS OF A PERSIAN IN ENGLAND TO HIS FRIEND AT ISPAHAN  THOU askest if the English are as free as hereto∣fore the courtiers assure me confidently that  they are but the men who have least relation to the court are daily alarming themselves and others with apprehension of danger to their libertyI have been told that the Parliament is the curb to the king's au∣thority and yet I am well informed that the only way to advancement in the court is to gain a seat in Parliament  The House of Commons is the representative of the nation nevertheless there are many great  towns  which send to deputies thither and many hamlets almost un∣inhabited that have a right of sending  two  Several members have never seen their electors and several are elected by the  Paliament  who were rejected by the  people  All the electors swear not to sell their voices yet many of the candidates are undone by the expence of  buying them  This whole affair is involved in deep mistery and inexplicable difficulties  Thou askest if commerce be as flourishing as for∣merly Some whom I have consulted upon that head say it is now in its meridian and there is really an appearance of its being so for luxury is  prodigiously  encreased and it is hard to imagine how it can be supported without an inexhaustible trade But  others  pretend that  this very luxury  is a proof of its decline and they add that the  frauds  and  villanies  in all the trading companies are so many inward poisons which if not speedily expelled will destroy it entirely in a little time  Thou wouldst know if property be so safely guarded as is generally believed It is certain that the whole power of a King of  England  cannot force an acre of land from the weakest of his subjects but a  knavish attorney  will take away his whole estate by those very  laws  which were designed for its security The  judges  are uncorrupt  appeals  are free and notwithstanding all these advantages it is usually better for a man to lose his right than to sue for it  These  Mirza  are the  contradictions  that perplex me My judgment is bewildered in uncertainty  I doubt my own observations and distrust the rela∣tions of others more time and better information may perhaps clear them up to me till then modesty forbids me to impose my conjectures upon thee after the manner of Christian  travellers  whose prompt decisions are the effect rather of folly than penetra∣tion  A LESSON FOR GENTLEMEN VOLUN∣TEERS  From the  LETTERS OF A PERSIAN IN ENGLAND TO HIS FRIEND AT ISPAHAN  AS I was walking in the fields near this city the other morning a disbanded soldier some∣what in years implored my charity and to excite my compassion bared his bosom on which were the scars of many wounds all received in the service of his country I gladly relieved his wants and being desirous to inform myself of every thing fell into discourse with him on the wars in which he had served He told me he had been present at the taking of ten or twelve strong towns and had a share in the danger and glory of almost as many victories How then said I comes it to pass that you are laid aside Thy strength is indeed in its decline but not yet wasted and I should think that experience would well supply the loss of youth Alas Sir answered he I have a good heart and tolerable limbs but I want three inches more of stature I am brave and able enough thank God but not quite handsome enough to be a soldier  How then didst thou serve so long returned I in  Flanders  Sir said he there were some thousands such illlooking fellows who did very well in the day  of battle but would make no figure at a reviewIt appears to me very strange replied I that thou should∣est be poor after fighting so many years with such great success The plunder of a single town in the  east  is enough to enrich every soldier that helped to take it Plunder Sir said he we have no such term in the modern art of war We fight for sixpence a dayBut when you have gained a battle do you get nothing by itYes said he we have the ad∣vantage to go on and besiege a townAy then my honest lad comes your harvestThen Sir replied he it defends itself till we are half of us destroyed and when it can hold out no longer it capitulates that is every burgher saves his house and every soldier carries off his baggageWhat becomes of the conquering armyWhy the conquering army has the pleasure to besiege another town which capitulates also and at the end of the campaign it goes into quartersBut when you enter an enemy's country don't you raise contributions The generals do an∣swered he but military discipline allows no part of it to the common soldiers they have just sixpence a day as they had before  A LESSON FOR ALL MEN  From  LOOKE ON GOVERNMENT  WHETHER we consider natural reason which tells us that men being once born have a right to their preservation and consequently to meat and drink and such other things as nature affords for their subsistence Or revelation which gives us an account of those grants

taxes that another sum should next be deducted for support of the parish establishment instead of tolls tythes rates cesses c and that after these important matters were pro∣vided for the remainder of

differ very little Those who are abso∣lute desire to continue so and those who are not endeavour to become so hence the same maxims and manners almost in all courts Voluptuousness and profusion are encouraged the one to sink the people into indolence the other into poverty con∣sequently into despondency  A MODEST PLEA FOR AN EQUAL COMMONWEALTH AGAINST MONARCHY  Published in the Year    THOUGH I was never possest with a  evil spirit of opposition or genius of contrad  g and snarling at what is present but rather studied at least a passive if not an active compliance with the present power as knowing there was never any power whose commission was not passed if not un∣der the  broad seal  of Heaven's  approbation  yet at least by the  privyseal  of God's permissive  providence  which I have always taken as a sufficient warrant for paying the tribute of passive obedience wheresoever I received the benefit of reciprocal protection Yet I cann  but acknowledge some governments more pure refined and less prone to corruption than others and certainly those wherein the supreme magistrate whether one or more hath an interest  distinct from that of the people must be most apt to degenerate and have greatest propensity to tyranny and oppression Now whether  monarchy  that winds up all the strings in the  instrument of government  to the interest of a  single person  that tunes laws religion and all things to an harmony and compliance with the  monarch's  single will may not justly be suspected of this strain I leave at the bar of any considerate man's judgment to be decided  Certainly whatever gloss or varnish the courtship or flatteries of  princes  or their  parasites  may set upon it such a  government  is diametrically opposite to and inconsistent with the true liberty and happiness of any people  I remember to have read a pretty strange passage of one of the French kings that he was the most religious prince and greatest tyrant that ever wore the crown of  France  I was I confess some time startled at the strangeness of the  character  but our late experience of one might wear the same livery makes me able not only to digest the wonder but also to give credence to this general  aphorism  that whatever may be the qualifications of any prince in reference to the personal endowments of his mind the title of  good  was never justly attributed to any  king  in reference to his office except comparatively And therefore in my apprehension  elective  king∣doms have small advantage of  hereditary  by reason the unhappiness of such governments seems not so much to spring from the nature of the person admi∣nistering as of the office and dignity which ever lays an iron yoke of slavery and oppression on the peoples' necks So that considering the vast expence of blood and treasure with which the competition of the office and dignity is usually managed by the scarlet candidates of crowns and sceptres an here∣ditary monarchy may seem eligible as the lesser evil especially if by some fundamental constitution like the  Salique  law of  France  the absurd though not  unusual pretensions of women and children might be cut off For to hang the keys of the power civil and ecclesiastic upon  apron strings  and to put the sceptre into a hand sitter to were a distaff is to invert the order both of God and nature and to set a nation with its heels upwards And yet I know it is the opinion of some that women and children are fittest to make princes as being of a more passive spirit and therefore likeliest to steer by the ad  ice of wise council by reason they repose less stress and con∣fidence in their own prudence than men in autho∣rity of which the happy and prosperous reign of Queen  Elizabeth  is usually alledg'd but whether without wrong to the more than masculine vigour of her spirit and matchless quickness of parts whereby she was to a wonder qualified for government and reported rather to outstrip than come short of the more noble sex I leave others to judge But should we grant this assertion to have the countenance of reason and that experience had also set to it its seal of confirmation it is so far from being of any ad∣vantage to monarchy by warding off the blow usually given by such as skirmish against it with their rea∣sons sharpened with these inconveniences that it gives the deepest wound to its reputation that could be desired by asserting  oligarchy  which by the ge∣neral consent of all times and ages hath been ex∣ploded as one of the worst of tyrannies to be the best of monarchies  I have met with some that plead much for the  single person  that should be only the name without the thing the office without the power the sha∣dow or image without the substance as if it were impossible for men that are the masters and proprie∣tors of reason to be knit together into civil society and peace for their own common interest and safety without erecting either some gaudy thing to humour them or some scarecrow to fright them into obedi∣ence Nor do I know whose convenience would be  herein consulted except the lawyers who if like packhorses trained up in one road not able to change their accustomed pace or stile it be prudence for the nation to hazard a relapse into tyranny and again expose their lives and liberties to the will and lust of an arbitrary power to set up a  John  of  Oke  or  Will  of  Stile  with infinite expence of blood and treasure by reimposing the yoke so lately cast off that this pack c may not alter the stile and form of their writs c I say wherefore the nation should be so overindulgent to a corrupt interest of men rather than to regulate and reform the forms of law that through the subtility of this generation are be∣come rather snares than fences of our es  ates and properties falls not within the precincts of my ap∣prehension  Should we now unbowel and trace to its original this name for which there have of late appeared so many advocates I presume it would be found of as ill complexion as the word  Tyrant  was accounted among the Greeks the English word  king  being but the abbreviate of  cunning  the usual epithet as all men know of knaves and to speak truth expe∣rience hath made good though never so great a saint hath sate upon the throne the devil and a bishop have ever stept into the office For I am not of that fond opinion that  kings  are not capable in their pri∣vate capacities of like virtues and qualifications with other men but that notwithstanding their accom∣plishments how excellent how bright how orient soever are their personal virtues they stand on slip∣pery places and their dignities their interests their parasites their flatterers are snares too great for them to retain their integrity and therefore that the ta∣lent of sovereign power is too great too precious to be intrusted or deposited in one man's hand though an  angel  left so great a  temptation  should endanger his fall and make him apostate to a devil  That kings are God's scourges and given in wrath  we have the testimony of scripture  Nimrod  was a great hunter a mighty man a great oppressor and the first king or prince we read of the first that invaded the liberty of the world that usurped first authority and presumed to exercise dominion over his brethren the first that put a period to that golden age wherein no other than paternal government was known but though thus nigh the morning of time God sent his scourge  Nimrod  as a just plague amongst the other nations of the earth yet the people of God the seed of  Abraham  the children of  Israel  were a long while after free a free state and enjoyed their native liberties till the time of  Samuel  when they rebelled and desired a king like the other nations that they might be like the heathen whom God had cast out before them which God construed no other than apostacy and rejecting of him than rebellion and high treason against his own divine majesty and said  They have rejected me  And then tells them what would be the issue fruit and product thereof  They should give away their liberty and be sub∣jected to an arbitrary power and become the slaves and vassals of their king who should take their sons and their daughters to make them his servants and send them forth to fight his battles that is to be the instruments of his pride and luxury and the cham∣pions of his malice and ambition  And then he should destroy their property and take away their houses and their vineyards and give them to his servants Thus the spirit of God gives the same description of a  King  as of what we call a  Tyrant  a  Nero  a  Monster  as if they were all one and it were essential to the nature of the office or dignity to be a  beast of prey a l  viathan  an oppressor and de∣vourer of the people which character hath been too easy to be read in the lives of most of the best kings whose names are not taken off the file of memory  Now as for those that would have a mock a counterfeit a limited king a king and no king an  empty title a bare name  vox preterea nihil  or I know not what they propose a remedy worse than the disease for to divide the sovereignty is to say a seene of blood to sow the seed of a perpetual civil war and intail ruin on ourselves and posterity  What is divided cannot stand  there will spring up perpetual jealousies fears and animosities which will cause intrenchings on each others authority until the one have supplanted and overturned the other this is to institute a civil war anarchy and confusion instead of a well ordered commonwealth or politic  Having thus unmasked the true nature of mo∣narchy which is no other than the mere gentle or civil expression of tyranny I shall endeavour to ob∣viate some of the most plausible and strenuous argu∣ments by whose strength and subtility it is endea∣voured to be obtruded and our assents conciliated to the reception thereof  One of the grand arguments whereby the betrayers of our liberty endeavour to decoy us into the iron yoke we have so lately shaken of is taken from our long use and custom to draw therein which hath rendered slavery a second nature to us and therefore endeavour to scare us from our liberty as a novel and dangerous thing as if servitude were more natural to a nation than freedom or any custom could utterly expunge nature I am sure the former cannot reflect with the greater disgrace or more derogate from the honour of our nation that we should be of so coarse a metal so base an alloy of so spaniellike couchant slavish and degenerate a spirit than the other doth deviate from truth but the worthy advocates of this cause measure truth by the wicked standard of their base and corrupt designs as they take altitude of all other mens spirits though never so brave and eleva∣ted by the Jacob's staff of their own pitiful crouch∣ing fawning humour  It would waste more ink and paper than I am either willing or have leisure to bestow should I shew how much the state of our nation is altered and into how  great an unsuitableness we are of late travelled unto that government this argument would plead precrip∣tion for  But of what weight or trurh is it of will easily appear to any that have taken notice of that passage of our modern history of the last century which c  erns the gallant hero Sir Philip Sidney who though born in that most unlucky juncture of time for prod  cing brave spirits when the nation tr  led under the go∣vernment of a woman was yet thought word  y of the Polish crown and had an overture in order to his election thereto had not his jealous mistress prevent∣ed if then one born under the inf  ences of a female government and not of the highest rank of nobility was thought si  to sway a scepter of how great blasphemy against the honour of our nation may they be thought guilty who say the  r  born people of England after they have  roke the more ancient Norman yoke and the more modern of a lat∣ter c are not  to enjoy that liberty that hath been the price of so much blood and treasure But should we concede all the argument seem  to beg that our necks are used to the yoke and we are be∣come familiar to servitude shall  e the  fore will∣ingly suffer our ears to be bored to the posts of our new masters and become slave  for ever Shall we court our bonds and glory in that which is our shame Shall we never learn to be free and value liberty Shall we never emancipate ourselves and posterity but intail thraldom and s  cry on them also to all generations For so long as we draw in this yoke our condition is the  with slaves whatsoever is born unto us is a ves  l of our Lords the fruit of our loins must drink of the same cup with us draw in the same yoke groan under the same tyranny and oppression we bequeath unto them nay who knows but their bondage may  n  rease li  e that of Israel's under the son or Solomon whose little finger was heavier than his father's l  ins for tyran∣nies usually exasperate and wax worse with continu∣ance  shall we now bequeath our children liberty or bonds freedom or oppression If we who have had our necks worn with the yoke and our backs bowed down with heavy burdens are of a couchant slavish spirit perhaps our posterity if born in a freer air and under the influences of a more benign govern∣ment may prove of more generous and noble spirits worthy of and knowing how to prize their liberty But without doubt those brave and gallant souls by the conduct of whose valour and prudence we have broken the iron yoke of arbitrary and exorbitant power and by the good providence of God redeemed the captivity of our nation from the unrighteous bonds of its wicked oppressors are worthy of and know how to prize and improve what hath been pur∣chased with so much  eat and oil and will not in the end sell their birthright for a mess of pottage but leave an offspring heirs of their own valour and gal∣lantry that will with the utmost peril of their lives and fortunes desend and preserve what the labours of their ancestors hath purchased with sore travel both of mind and body and so transmit it intire to their posterity through msny generations till the consummation of all things and that time shall be no more  But for a farther and more fatisfactory answer to silence this argument we may consider how the scene is changed and balance of lands altered since these last centuries and by reason thereof with how great difficulty monarchy hath made good its ground since Henry the Eighth's days in which it first began most visible to decline and hath ever since been post∣ing to its period  For that wilful prince by alienating the church revenues quite altered the balance of lands that was the basis of his government and thereby did that service unawares that pulled up the stake of monar∣chy for the church which with all its preferments was at the king's devotion and sole dispose did at that time possess a third part of the lands and wealth  of the whole nation which being afterwards sold and coming into the hands of private men set up many thousands of families that had no dependence on the crown Since which time the number of freeholders being much encreased the nation hath had a natural and strong vergency towards a com∣monwealth which hath been much discovered in the spirit and complexion of our parliaments of which the house of commons heretofore an inconsiderable truckling kind of court that was only summoned for the Prince to milk their purses and let the peo∣ple blood in the silver vein grew now more peremp∣tory and began to give check to their princes exor∣bitances insomuch that Queen Elizabeth was put to her courtship to retain them in allegiance as after∣wards King James to a thousand shifts and juggles who notwithstanding all his Kingcraft and cunning in which he so much gloried and boasted himself so great a master was scarce able with much juggling and dissimulation to divert the storm from falling on his own head which afterward rained so much blood and vengeance on his son and posterity to the utter ruin and confusion of his family  To conclude therefore this particular it being a maxim of truth placed beyond all hazard of contra∣diction that no government can be fixed in this nation but according to the balance of land That Prince that is not able neither by his own nor the public revenue in some measure to counterpoise if not over balance the greater part of the people must necessarily be tenant at will for the crown he wears for they that are the proprietors of the land and wealth of any nation will with ease be able by that magnetism to draw the greatest number of abettors to their side and so to gild over their pretensions as to render them current with the people and so in the end give law to the rest of their brethren Therefore where there is one proprietor or landlord as in Turkey there is absolute monarchy where a few aristocracy c  Now since the crown lands and church lands of  this nation are sold what other prop or pillar of securi∣ty is left for the throne of a prince to rest upon ex∣cept that of a mercenary army lies not within view of my apprehensions and then how wholesome or safe advice the reestablishing of monarchy is to this nation I leave all men that have not altogether ab∣jured their reason and conscience to judge and deter∣mine  As for those poetical if not prophane flourishes wherewith orators and poets the constant parasites of princes use to gild over monarchy pretending it the most natural and rational of all other forms of government and that whose pattern was first shown in the mount or rather let down from heaven para∣le  ling it with God's regimen of the universe which is alledged as its prototype first  exemplar  and there∣fore to have something more of a divine right and character impressed upon it than any other c  These I say are such trite bald and slight rea∣sonings that they do not merit so much respect as to receive an answer for may we not as well by this loose and allusive way of arguing borrow a pattern from heaven for the triumvirate that Augustus Le∣pidus and Mare Antony sometime imposed on Rome  Doth it not as well quadrate with the sacred Trinity by the triple sceptred of whose divine providence the empire of the world is administered as by their's sometime that of the Romans Will any one therefore be so bold as to say that it was the most natural and rational government and founded by no less than a di∣vine right according to its pattern and archetype in the heavens notwithstanding the brand of the blackest and bloodiest tyranny Rome ever saw hath been set thereon by the universal consent of all historians  Or may we not considering the pride ambition rapine extortion injury and oppression that usually crowd into the courts of the best princes with as much or more reason parallel absolute monarchy with that of the prince of darkness in which there is no Tri∣nity as in the other and therefore more exactly  quadrate to the absoluteness our proud monarchs so much endeavour to obtain  I confess could we have a prince to whom majesty might be atributed without prophane hyperboles that was a true vicar or lieutenant of God that was not subject to the passions and infirmities much less the vices and monstrosities of human nature that could neither be imposed on by deceit nor abused by flattery whom the passions neither of fear nor affection could warp to the least declivity from what is right and honest whose reason could never be biassed by any private interest or base respect to decline the paths of justice and equity but would manage the reins of his power with a like constan∣cy and steadiness as by the hand of Providence the helm of the universe is steered I should then become an advocate of monarchy and acknowledge it to have the impress of divinity and bear the character and inscription of God upon it to be the best and most absolute form of government and a true copy of its divine original but till security be given for such a righteous administration I desire to be excused from being a pander to ambition or the advocate of ty∣ranny as having learnt  It is not good for man to be alone  especially on the high and slippery places where the strongest heads are apt to wax giddy but  in the multitude of counsellors there is safety  and methinks the very dialect of princes in the plural number what∣ever of state or majesty may be pretended is a witness of and doth clearly speak the unnaturalness of such exorbitant monopolies of power and that though they act in a single capacity are willing to speak like a commonwealth  Most of the other arguments of which the advo∣cates of tyranny make use are drawn from the pre∣tended advantages of that government above and be∣yond others in respect of secrecy celerity unanimity and the like which though conveniencies yet being far too light to counterpoise and balance the other in commodities together with the great charge and ex∣cise  they are rated at require no other answer nor shall I waste more time and ink upon them  Having thus passed the pikes of the sharpest argu∣ments that are usually raised in defence of the odd thing called a single person I shall only speak a word or two to that is founded on the single command that in times of war and eminent danger when the gates of Janus's temple are set open is committed to one man it being a received maxim that reason hath always conceded an advantage to the absolute jurisdiction of a single person in the field prescribing to that end but one general to an army for fear of divisions upon contrary counsels and commands  To which may be replied notwithstanding ge∣nerals are not taken upon trust as  kings  in successive  monarchies  but upon the test of experience and proved sufficiency manifested in former services yet if it seem expedient to the  commonwealth  there may be a rotation in that office as well as others as was anci∣ently in the  Roman republic  whose armies were led forth by their annual successive consuls and that with great success and victory  But the expedient our present parliament hath found out by commission doth so fully answer this objection that I need say no more unto it for without doubt it is the interest of a free state to have all the people so trained up in military discipline and made fami∣liar with arms that he may not be thought arrived at the just accomplishments of a gentleman that is not able to lead an army in the field it being among the Romans no absurd apostrophe to leave the plough∣tail to head an army or  vice versa  when their military employments were accomplished how much then may they be thought to fall short of the accomplishments of a gentleman that know not how to manage the conduct of a troop of horse as I fear too many of our gentry upon a due scrutiny would be found who notwithstanding all their great pre∣tences to be accounted  armigeri  or esquires are scarce stout enough to discharge a pistol or were  ever militant beyond the borders of their ladies carpets  I shall now sound a retreat to the further progress of my pen on this theme lest I should seem too much to triumph over a baffled and prostrate enemy it being my desire to use victory with like modera∣tion I desire to bear a foil conquest or captivity therefore fince by the good providence of God together with the gallant conduct of the no less pru∣dent than valiant assertors of our native rights and liberties we are reinstated in the possession of our birthrights I shall attempt the discovery of those rocks and shelves on which in the late night of  apos∣tacy  we split our liberties and endanger the utter ruin and shipwreck of our lives and fortunes in the dangerous sea of an exorbitant and unlimited  power  and thereby strike some sparks of light for the future better steering of the commonwealth in whose bot∣tom as all our lives and felicities are adventured we are all concerned to endeavour its being brought into a safe port and harbour  The work then of our present pilots that sit at the stern and manage the conduct of our affairs is to endeavour the commonwealth may be so equally ba∣lanced as it may neither have propensity to a second relapse into monarchy as of late or  oligarchy  which is worse nor yet into  anarchy  the worst of all three But to settle a freestate upon such just and righteous foundations as cannot be moved that may be a strong rampire of defence not only to our civil liberties as men from the future enchroachment of tyranny or inundation of exorbitant power but also of security to our spiritual liberties as Christians from the invasion of those that desire to domineer and lord it over the consciences of their brethren both which seem so linked and twisted to each other that what conduces to the security of one hath no smail tendency to the establishing of the other also and do commonly so inseparable accompany each other that wheresoever there is a freestate or equal  commonwealth liberty of conscience is inviolably preserved together with convenient and inoffensive latitude in toleration of religions as in Holland Venice c  Now for the better securing of these we are to take notice of what persons or things are most incon∣sistent with and have greatest enmity to the interest of a freestate or equal commonwealth  For discovery of which as I know it a crime of presumption unpardonable for one seated in the vale of a private condition to pretend a fairer prospect into the interest of state than those Providence hath placed in the watchtowers and on the pinnacles of power yet by reason a bystander may be allowed to discern something of the game and he that is out of play to shew the ground to a bowler and one that stands below may better know what props the foundation rests upon than he that is on the top of the tower and it being the duty of every one to cast in his mite to the vaster treasures of their know∣ledge to whom Providence hath committed the conduct of our affairs I am bold being partly thereto encouraged by that great candour where∣with I observe the like tribute of zealous and faithful hearts are already received to tender what in my apprehension may have a tendency to a future settlement and security I confess were we at this time bowed down under the govern∣ment of a monarch in whose court every coun∣sellor of state is to be taken on an implicit faith to enjoy by his prince's patent and favour a monopoly of reason as well as honour and that his understand∣ing is no less elevated than according to the propor∣tion his titles and fortunes swell above the tide of other mens I might justly be accounted absurd to offer any thing of this nature as knowing with what scorn and contempt so rash an adventure would be encountered  But in a free state where the greatest senators are not ashamed to confer with the meanest persons I am  not afraid to put myself into the crowd of those that make addresses of this nature wherefore to conclude this parenthesis and resume the thread of our dis∣course there are nor as I presume past two or three sorts of persons whose interests run counter to or indeed are not twisted and wound up in the same bot∣ton with that of a free state or at least in the spin∣ning out of a few years might not be interwoven therewith and those are the Lawyer the Divine and Hereditary Nobility as for the Cavalier and Courtier I question not but a little time would breathe out their antipathy and warp their affections to a perfect compliance and closing with an equal commonwealth  Discontent productive of Human Happiness and the Elevation of the Species  From  Young's Spirit of Athens  WHY are we tenacious of liberty but because it gives an open field to that exertion of our minds or bodies whence alone pleasure can proceed whether they are employed in tracking a wild beast or in exploring a system it is the same plea∣sure and restriction to the man who hath once tasted it is surely worse than death  The discontented spirit of mankind so often and so much deprecated by every trifler in metaphysics is then found to be consistent with their happiness and necessary to their improvement Divinely is it thus instituted that the activity of our faculties should constitute our happiness whilst what blesses the indi∣vidual enriches the species and the pursuit which gives pleasure to each tends to some acquisition pro∣ductive of further distinctions to humanity and eli∣vating it more and more in the system in which it makes a part  AN ODE IN IMITATION OF ALCAEUS  By Sir  WILLIAM JONES  Kt  One of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature at  Calcutta  WHAT constitutes a State  Not highrais'd battlement or labour'd mound  Thick wall or moated gate  Not cities proud with spires and turrets crown'd  Where laughing at the storm rich navies ride  Not starr'd and spangled courts  Where lowbred baseness wafts perfume to pride  NoMEN highminded MEN  With pow'rs as far above dull brutes endu'd  In sorest brake or den  As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude  Men who their  duties  know  But know their  rights  and knowing dare maintain  Prevent the longaim'd blow  And crush the tyrant while they rend the chain  These  constitute a State  And sov'reign LAW  that State's collected will  O'er thrones and globes elate  Sits Empress crowning good repressing ill  Smit by her sacred frown  The fiend  Discrection  like a vapour sinks  And e'en the alldazzling  Crown  Hides his faint rays and at her bidding shrinks  Such  was  this heav'nlov'd isle  That  Lesbos  fairer and the  Cretan  shore  No more shall freedom smile  Shall  Britons  languish and be MEN no more  Since all must life resign  Those sweet rewards which decorate the brave  'Tis folly to decline  And steal inglorious to the silent grave  Every Man is born with an imprescriptible Claim to a Portion of the Elements  From  Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders  IT is a truth I believe not to be called in question that every man is born with an imprescriptible claim to a portion of the elements which portion is termed his  birthright  Society may vary this right as to its form but never can destroy it in sub∣stance She has no controul over the man till he is born and the right being born with him and being necessary to his existence she can no more annihilate the one than the other though she has the power of newmodelling both But on coming into the world he finds that the ground which nature had promised him is taken up and in the occupancy of others society has changed the form of his birthright the general stock of elements from which the lives of men are to be supported has undergone a new modi∣fication and his portion among the rest He is told that he cannot claim it in its present form as an in∣dependent inheritance that he must draw on the stock of society instead of the stock of nature that he is banished from the mother and must cleave to the nurse In this unexpected occurrence he is un∣prepared to act but knowledge is a part of the stock of society and an indispensible part to be allotted to the portion of the claimant is  instruction  relative to the new arrangement of natural right To with∣hold this instruction therefore would be not merely the omission of a duty but the commission of a crime and society in this case would sin against the man before the man could sin against society  I should hope to meet the assent of all unprejudiced readers in carrying this idea still further In cases where a person is born of poor parents or finds himself brought into the community of men without the means of sub∣sistence society is bound in duty to furnish him with the means She ought not only to instruct him in the arti∣ficial laws by which property is secured but in the arti∣ficial industry by which it is obtained She is bound in  justice  as well as policy to give him some art or trade For the reason of his incapacity is that  she  has usurped his birthright and this restoring it to him in another form more convenient to both parties The failure of society in this branch of her duty is the occasion of much the greater part of the evils that call for criminal jurisprudence The indi∣vidual feels that he is robbed of his natural right he cannot bring his process to reclaim it from the great community by which he is overpowered he there∣fore feels authorized in reprisal in taking another's goods to replace his own And it must be confessed that in numberless instances the conduct of society justifies him in this proceeding she has seized  his  pro∣perty and commenced the war against him  Some who perceive these truths say that it is unsafe for society to publish them but I say it is unsafe not to publish them For the party from which the mischief is expected to arise has the knowledge of them already and has acted upon them in all ages It is the wise who are ignorant of these things and not the foolish They are truths of na∣ture and in them the teachers of mankind are the only party that remains to be taught It is a subject on which the logic of indigence is much clearer than that of opulence The latter reasons from contri∣vance the former from feeling and God has not endowed us with false feelings in things that so weightily concern our happiness  None can deny that the obligation is much stronger on me to support my life than to support the claim that my neighbour has to his property Nature commands the first society the secondIn one I obey the laws of God which are universal and eter∣nal in the other the laws of man which are local and temporary  It has been the folly of old governments to begin every thing at the wrong end and to erect their in∣stitutions on an inversion of principle This is more  sadly the case in their systems of jurisprudence than is commonly imagined  Compelling  justice is always mistaken for  rendering  justice But this important branch of administration consists not merely in com∣pelling men to be just to each other and individuals to societythis is not the whole nor is it the prin∣cipal part nor even the beginning of the operation The source of power is said to be the source of justice but it does not answer this description as long as it contents itself with  compulsion  Justice must begin by flowing from its source and the first as well as the most important object is to open its channels from society to all the individual members This part of the administration being well devised and diligently executed the other parts would lessen away by de∣grees to matters of inferior consideration  It is an undoubted truth that our duty is insepa∣rably connected with our happiness and why should we despair of convincing every member of society of a truth so important for him to know Should any person object by saying that nothing like this has ever been tried Society has hitherto been curst with governments whose existence depended on the ex∣tinction of truth Every moral light has been smo∣thered under the bushel of perpetual imposition from whence it emits but faint and glimmering rays al∣ways insufficient to form any luminous system on any of the civil concerns of men But these covers are crumbling to the dust with the governments which they support and the probability becomes more ap∣parent the more it is considered that society is capable of curing all the evils to which it has given birth  HOW TO CONSTITUTE A FREE GOVERN∣MENT  From  CATO'S LETTERS  THE only Secret in forming a Free Government is to make the interests of the Governors and of the Governed the same as far as human policy can contrive Liberty cannot be preserved any other way Men have long found from the weakness and depravity of themselves and one another that most men will act for interest against duty as often as they dare So that to engage them to their duty interest must be linked to the observance of it and danger to the breach of it Personal advantages and security must be the rewards of duty and obedience and dis∣grace torture and death the punishment of treach∣ery and corruption  Human wisdom has yet found out but one certain expedient to effect this and that is to have the con∣cerns of all directed by all as far as possibly can be and where the persons interested are too numerous or live too distant to meet together on all emergencies they must moderate necessity by prudence and act by deputies whose interest is the same with their own and whose property is so intermingled with theirs and so engaged upon the same bottom that princi∣pals and deputies must stand and fall together When the deputies thus act for their own interest by acting for the interest of their principals when they can make no law but what they themselves and their posterity must be subject to when they can give no money but what they must pay their share of when they can do no mischief but what must fall upon their own heads in common with their countrymen their principals may then expect good laws little mischief and much frugality  Here therefore lies the great point of necessity and care in forming the constitution that the persons en∣trusted  and representing shall either never have an interest detached from the persons entrusting and re∣presented or never the means to pursue it Now to compass this great point effectually no other way is left but one of these two or rather both namely to make the deputies so numerous that there may be no possibility of corrupting the majority or by changing them so often that there is no sufficient time to corrupt them and to carry the ends of that corruption The people may be very sure that the major part of their deputies being honest will keep the rest so and that they will all be honest when they have no temptations to be knaves  The glorious Prospect of better Times which are fast approaching  From  The Critic Philosopher  He hath shewed strength with his arm he hath  SCAT∣TERED  the proud in

pretensions the cler∣gy must be reformed and brought back to that sim∣ple evangelical modesty that most beautiful orna∣ment which a proud and worldy spirit has long dis∣figured  The rich must be convinced that while they live sumptuously and while the POOR are fed with a few of the  scanty crumbs  which fall from their table they act quite contrary to the tenor of that gospel which they say they believe It is not in nature or reason that one man should destroy twenty thousand a year and another sh  uld be left without the common ne∣cessaries of life No every creature which nature hath formed with a mouth and digestive powers has an equal right to participate of her blessings  To conclude we trust that the glorious fabric of freedom reared up as it were by the hand of Oni∣potence will soon appear A fabric that will stand fir  and un  haken as being fenced round with bar∣riers which will mock the dark designs of treachery and bid defiance to the impotent efforts of despo∣tism and corruption  Mr Burke's tyrannical system of politics and confined ideas of liberty published in his late pamph∣let must fall to the ground and every scheme or plan made use of to oppress the human race must be destroyed Wealth and property must be wrested from the hands of rapacity and indolence and di∣vided amongst mankind at large in proportion as they merit it Then will those of useful invigorated industry shine as useful members of the community 'Tis true nations like individuals seem subject to in∣fatuation and while they are under its influence they submit to treatment which would shock them if they were in their proper senses Men can assign no other reason for bearing oppression than that they bore it beforeThe world is grown old in error I grant but it should not on that account preclude re∣form  Notwithstanding its great age society is hardly yet got beyond its first elements Legisla∣tors have hitherto only drawn lines or boundaries to confine mankind instead of tracing plans to make them happy In all their general institutions they seem to have been ignorant that man is a being formed for love and friendship they have rather considered him as in a state of perpetual warfare with his fellowcreatures Hence it is that the systems of all governments and the spirit of their laws have been directed rather to separate than to unite the different members of society by granting peculiar privileges to some by restraining others by render∣ing the meltitude passive and giving activity and power only to a few by occasioning superabundance in palaces and famine in the peasant's cot by coun∣teracting in short the designs of God and nature in the impartial diffusion of their blessings  Laws founded upon such unnatural principles have kept the whole machine of society in a state of perpetual discord and distraction They have hinder∣ed the rich from becoming humane by giving a sanction to their insolent luxuries They have rob∣bed the poor of every right even of permission to utter their complaints they have chained down ge∣nius clipped the wings of thought and chilled with freezing pressure the warm sallies of sensibility By treating man as a ferocious animal those laws have made him so in reality They made him jea∣lous of his fellowcreatures they erected a wall of prejudice and division between one people and ano∣ther their voice like that of  demons  crying out to the inhabitants of every country  be guarded against strangers and foreigners and look upon them as your natural enemies  By these means a sort of constant hostility has been kept up in the universe man being at war with man nation with nation and empire with empire  We have a book which we call our guide to eter∣nal happiness it teacheth us that all the human  race descended from one man and that we are all brethren yet we are by our own laws daily en∣acting a specific distinction and giving one part of us a statute authority to commit rapine and plunder the other We believe that a divine prophet came down exerted himself and died for the redemption of all nations from misery and punishment and while we sacrifice to him for this unparalelled love we overwhelm one another with the very evils which he by his examples and sufferings taught us to avoid  THE ADVANTAGES OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH  From  THE CANDID PHILOSOPHER  EVERY one will allow that freedom of thought ought not and cannot be restrained however freedom of speech may be so The judge observed very justly to a satirical author that the law forbade him to call him rogue "I know it my lord" re∣plied as justly the arch wag "but the law does not forbid my  thinking  your lordship one"  Since then freedom of thought cannot be taken from a man and is confessedly useful let us briefly consider the advantages of Freedom of Speech  And here a most excellent author occurs to me and I shall give his sentiments on the subject as nearly as I can remember they being perfectly agreeable to my own  The passions are not to be extinguished but with life To forbid therefore people to speak is to for∣bid them to feelThe more men express of their hate and resentment perhaps the less they retain and sometimes they vent the whole that way but these passions where they are smothered will be apt to fester to grow venomous and to discharge them∣selves  by a more dangerous organ than the mouth even by an armed and vindictive hard Less danger∣ous is a railing mouth than an heart filled with bit∣terness and curses and more terrible to a prince ought to be the secret execrations of his people than their open revilings or than even the assaults of his enemies In truth where no liberty is allowed to speak of governors besides that of praising them their praises will be little regarded Their tender∣ness and aversion to have their conduct examined will be  to prompt people to think their conduct guilty or  to suspect their management and designs to be worse tha  perhaps they are and to become turbulent and seditious rather than be forced to be silent  THE MARSEILLES MARCH OR HYMN  YE sons of France awake to glory  Hark hark what myriads bid you rise  Your children wives and grandsires hoary  Behold their tears and hear their cries  Shall hateful tyrants mischief breeding  With hireling hosts a ruffian band  Affright and desolate the land  While peace and liberty lie bleeding  To arms to arms ye brave  Th' avenging sword unsheath  March on march on all hearts resolv'd  On victory or death  Now now the dang'rous storm is rolling  Which treach'rous kings confed'rate raise  The dogs of war let loose are howling  And so our fields and cities blaze  And shall we basely view the ruin  Wh  le lawless force with guilty stride  Spread desolation far and wide  With crimes and blood his hands embruing  To arms to arms ye brave c  With luxury and pride surrounded  The vile insatiate despots dare  Their thirst of power and gold unbounded  To mete and vend the light and air  Like beasts of burthen would they load us  Like Gods would bid their slaves adore  But man is man and who is more  Then shall they longer lash and goad us  To arms to arms ye brave c  O Liberty can man resign thee  Once having felt thy gen'rous flame  Can dungeons bolts and bars confine thee  Or whips thy noble spirit tame  Too long the world has wept bewailing  That falsehood's dagger tyrants wield  But Freedom is our sword and shield  And all their arts are unavailing  To arms to arms ye brave c  Translation of an Extract from a late Publication intituled Les Ruines by M De Volney Member of the late Constitutive National Assembly of France and author of "Travels in Syria and Egypt"  This book is supposed to be written on the Ruins of Palmyra where a Spectre or Genius appears to the Author and after taking him up into the Heavens shews him below our Hemisphere ac∣counts for past and foretels many future Revo∣lutions after which the work thus proceeds  SCARCE had the genius finished these words be∣fore an immense noise was heard towards the west when that way directing my attention I perceived within the extremity of the Mediterranean within the domains of one of the nations of Europe a pro∣digious movement such as when in the bosom of a  vast city a violent sedition breaking out in all its parts one sees an innumerable people agitated and rushing like torrents into the streets and public places And my ears struck with shouts which rent the skie  distinguished at intervals these phrases  "What is then this prodigy What is this cruel and mysterious scourge We are a numerous nation yet we want hands We have an excellent soil and we want necessaries We are active laborious and we live in indigence We pay enormous taxes and yet we are told they are not sufficient We are at peace abroad and neither our persons nor our pro∣perty are in safety at home What is then the con∣cealed enemy which devours us"  And certain voices issuing from the bosom of the multitude answered "Erect a distinct standard around which let all those assemble who by useful labours support and nourish society and you will then discover the enemy which consumes you"  And the standard being raised the nation was all at once divided into two bodies unequal and of an aspect in all respects different from each other the one innumerable and comparatively almost total presented in the general poverty of their apparel and in the meagre tanned air of their countenance ap∣pearances of misery and labour the small group an inconsiderable fraction presented in all the splen∣dour of clothes bedaubed with gold and silver and in the plumpness of their faces symptoms of leisure and abundance And considering these men more attentively I perceived that the great body was com∣posed of labourers of ar  izans of shopkeepers of all the professions useful to society and that in the small group there were only priests of the higher orders financiers nobles great officers of armies in a word nothing but the civil military and reli∣gious agents of government  After these two bodies had in the presence of each other face to face considered one another with astonishment I saw indignation and rage spring  up on the one hand and a kind of fear and dismay on the other when the great body said to the small one  "Why have you separated from us Are you not then o  number"  "N  " answered the small group "ye are but the people we are a different kind of beings we are of a distinguished class who have our laws our cus∣toms our rights pecular to ourselves"  People  And what business do you follow in our society  Distinguished Class  Nonewe are not made to work  People  How then have you acquired your riches  Distinguished Class  By taking  e trouble to go∣vern you  People  Really Let us see what it is you call government We toil and sweat and you enjoy we produce and you dissipateDistinguished Class who are not the people form a separate nation if you please and take the trouble to govern your∣selves  Whereupon the small group deliberating on the new case a few of the most enlightened of them said"Let us join ourselves again to the people and share with them their burdens and their occupa∣tions for they are men as well as ourselves" but the rest said "No it would be a shame it would be infamous to confound ourselves with the vulgar they are made to serve us we are men of a different race"  And the  Civil Governors  said "This people is mild and naturally servile let us speak to them of the king and of the law and they will presently reenter into their duty People The king wills it the sovereign ordains it"  People  The king can only will the good of the people the sovereign can only ordain according to the law  Civil Governors  The law enacts that ye be sub∣missive  People  The law is the general will and we  will  a new order  Civil Governors  You will be a rebellious people  People  Nations cannot revolt tyrants are the only rebels  Civil Governors  The king is with us and he commands you to submit  People  The kingly office originates in the people who elect one of themselves to execute it for the general good kings therefore are essentially indi∣visible from their nations The king of our's then cannot be with you you only possess his phantom  And the  Military Governors  stepping forward said "The people are timid let us menace them they only obey force Soldiers chastise this insolent rabble  People  Soldiers you are of our own blood Will you strike your brothers If the people perish who will maintain the army  And the soldiers grounding their arms said to their chiefs we are also the people we are the ene∣mies of  Whereupon the  Ecclesiastical Governors  said "There is now but one resource left the people are superstitious we must frighten them with the names of God and of religion  Our dearly beloved brethren our childrenGod has appointed us to govern you  People  Produce to us your heavenly powers  Priests  You must have faith reason will lead you astray  People  Do you govern then without reason  Priests  God ordains peace Religion pr  scribes obedience  People  Peace presupposes justice Obedience has a right to know the law it bows to  Priests  Man is only born into this world to suffer  People  Do you then set us the example  Priests  Will you live without Gods and without kings  People  We will live without tyrants without impostors  Priests  Meditators interceders are necessary to you  People  Meditators between us and God between us and kings Courtiers and priests your services cost us too dear we will henceforward treat for ourselves immediately with the principals  And hereupon the small group said  "We are undone the multitude are enlightened  And the people answered You are saved for in∣asmuch as we are enlightened we will not abuse our power we wish for nothing beyond our rights We have resentments but we forget them We were slaves we might command and retort upon you your own principles we will only be free we are so  This dialogue between the people and the idle classes is the analysis of all society All the vices▪ all the political disorders are deducible from this source Men who do nothing and who devour the substance of others men who arrogate to them∣selves particular rights exclusive privileges of rich∣es and idleness such men are the source and defi∣nition of all the abuses which exist among all nati∣ons Compare the Mamloucks of Egypt the nobles of Europe the Nairs of India the Emirs of Arabia the Patricians of Rome the Christian Priests the Imans the Bramins the Bonzes the Lamas c you will always find the same results  Idle men living at the expence of those who work  ON THE MINISTRY OR CLERGY BY THE AUTHOR OF A PLEA FOR A COM∣MONWEALTH  IT being the method of Heaven for  judgment to begin at the house of God  I shall first speak to the reformation of the public ministry or national cler∣gy so far as they seem prompted by their interest to run counter to that of a commonwealth and though I know notwithstanding the complexion of their coat which seems or at least ought to pro∣mise greater moderation it is no less dangerous to meddle or in the least exasperate this generation of men than to puddle in a hornets nest or en∣counter a bear robbed of her whelps yet my con∣science bearing me witness I have neither malice to their persons nor envy their preferments I shall not forbear to give in my testimony against the cor∣rupt interest and principles wherewith they are leavened where by the way I must profess myself unsatisfied of what ground or foundation may since the Jewish priesthood was abolished be found in scripture for that distinction between the laity and clergy which custom hath introduced into most Christian commonwealths my zeal and cha∣rity being apt to prompt me to a like wish with that of Moses  That all the Lords people were prophets  or rather to think all the Lord's people are holy and to be accounted a royal priesthood to God Nor can I persuade myself learning is so necessary a qualifi∣cation for teaching the gospel as some would make us believe having observed our Saviour altogether rejected the wisdom of man and made not use  the learned scribes or doctors of the law but sim∣ple and illiterate fishermen to be the first heralds of peace unto the world to proclaim goodwill to the children of men to be the first evangelists and messengers of the glad tidings of salvation and in∣deed  the introduction of learned rabbies into the church of Christ and blending divinity with the learning of the gentiles seems to run counter to the whole design of the gospel which is by the  foolishness of preaching to confound the wisdom of the world  Certainly the sword of God's spirit will be able to do its work though not managed by the skil∣ful hand of an artist or master of fence that hath been brought up in the polemicks and digladiations of human literature vain philosophy or sophistry of the schools  Nor do I find that the apostles and those sent forth by Christ to be the Catholic Bishops of the whole earth and to teach all nations did assume unto themselves any distinction of garb colour or habits from the  est of Christ's flock and I have read of some that were censured in the primitive times or first centuries for wearing large black cloaks for what is this but to bring back those jewish types and shadows to cloud and obscure the brightness of the Gospel's dispensation that were long since dispelled and abrogated by the rising of the Sun of righteousness upon the world For as one who hath lately well observed What is the canonical girdle and formality of doctors wearing boots but as types and allusions to those places of having their loins girt and their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel c  Nor do I read that they who were called to the ministry did look upon that as a writ of case or sufficient warrant to quit their other particular callings trades and vocations but that Paul wrought with his hands that he might not become burdensome and it is generally presumed our Sa∣viour wrought at his father's trade not that I would not have those that minister in spiritual things reap of other's carnal but that it seems more ac∣cording to the rule and president of the gospel that they should be content with what voluntary con∣tribution  God shall move the people's hearts unto than by force and rigour of law exact a maintenance  And when I find the apostle saluting the church in Caesar's family I am prompted to wish that all our houses were chapels unto the Lord and that our families like that of Caesar's contained a church within them I am sure it is no new ob∣servation that the greatest heat and zeal of religion hath been always found in conventicles and private meetings which suggests unto my thoughts no small ground of suspicion that our parochial churches bells together with the whole order pomp method and formality of our national cler∣gy and public worship stands upon no other foundation than that of human invention which by the stream of corrupt times have been carried beyond the pattern and president of the primitive ages and become very unlike and dissonant to the examplar Christ and his apostles left us  Nor am I satisfied if the generality of men are uncapable of receiving the truth and power of godliness whether the endeavours of giving all men a tincture of religion and forcing them into the garb and livery of an outward profession which is the great design of and plea for a national clergy be more acceptable unto God than morality I know under the law God had a peculiar people that were picked and culled as it were from the dross and rubbish of the rest of mankind that were to be built up in an outward profession and nati∣onal way of public worship adorned with many ceremonies together with much pomp and out∣ward splendour but whether religion be not now under the gospel a more inward refined spiritual and less visible thing I humbly submit to serious consideration And if I am herein mistaken for I pretend not to infallibility I should be thankful to any God shall be pleased to make use of as in∣struments to better inform me for I would wil∣lingly see and know my errors  But if it be here objected that the primitive times were times of persecution in which the church was as it were under hatches and chris∣tianity in its infancy and the professors thereof forced to hide themselves in holes of the rocks and caves of the earth but now having gained ground upon the world and being in better plight and since it is come up out of Egypt from the house of bondage from under the pressures persecutions afflictions and burdens of the heathenish taskmas∣ters under which it formerly groaned ought ac∣cording to the example of the Israelites be adorn∣ed with the spoils of the heathen c  I answer that as the kingdom of God comes not with observation so it consists not in any outward pomp and splendour Its said  the king's daughter  or spouse of Christ  is all glorious within  and by how much the more ground christianity hath gain∣ed upon the world by so much the less need doth it now stand of the wisdom and learning of men to commend and propagate it than when it was to encounter with so great opposition and such po¦tent antagonists as under the heathen emperors it met withal And if the truth did then under all those disadvantages not only make good its ground but so much gained upon the world when it had few other champions than poor fishermen and illiterate mechanics how much less need it now fear browbeating when the power of God hath subdued so many nations to the knowledge and obedience of his truth and hath made princes of the earth bow unto the scepter of his Son  Whether the nation is yet willing to part with their calves they have so long worshipped I know not but I am sure it hath pleased God to give them a great discovery of the corruption pride ambition and flattery of this sort of men how willing they could be to reap their own profit though sown in and springing from the ruin of the nation's liberty  and felicity how willingly they could sell their brethren slaves into the hands of tyranny and op∣pression to purchase to themselves dominion and lordship  THE DESIRE OF GLORY NATURALLY GENERATED IN REPUBLICS  FROM THE PERSIAN LETTERS  THE sanctuary of honour reputation and vir∣tue seems to be placed in republics and in those states where a man may with safety pro∣nounce the word country At  Rome Athens  and  Sparta  honour was the only reward for the most signal services A crown of oakleaves or laurel a statue an inscription was an immence return for a battle won or a city taken  There a man that had performed a noble action thought himself sufficiently recompenced in the action itself He could not see one of his coun∣trymen without feeling the inward satisfaction of knowing himself his benefactor he reckoned the  ber of his services by that of his fellow citi∣zens Any man is capable of doing a piece of service to another man but it is somewhat divine to contribute to the happiness of a whole society  The manly Spirit produced in France by their new System of Equality  From Dr Moore's Journal  IT was natural to think that the introduction of the term  egalite  would produce an universal inso∣lence among the lower classes of people in France towards their superiors but I confess I have not  hitherto remarked any disagreeable instances of this nature No person indeed of whatever rank is allowed to dress his footmen in livery but every one is allowed to have as many footmen as he pleases and when L L's carriage was driving a day or two since in at the gates of the Louvre it was stopped by the centinel who had observed that the hammercloth had fringes of a different colour and informed his lordship that such a kind of distinction was no where permitted in France▪ being contrary to that  egalite  which every Frenchman had sworn to The coachman had been ordered never to use any but a plain cloth but having a fringed one in his possession of which he was very vain he had ven∣tured to adorn his coachbox with it on this un∣fortunate day As the poor fellow was taking it off with a very mortified air the valet deplace re∣proached him for having put it on which the sen∣tinel over hearing said angrily to the coachman  ll sied bien  à  un gueux comone toi d'etre aris∣tocrate  It well becomes a beggar like you to give yourself the airs of an aristocrate  A few days since I saw a man dressed in the uniform of a general officer▪ come up to a poor fel∣low who with a pike in his hand stood centinel at a gate and addressing him by the name of "Ci∣toyen Soldat" asked him the way to a particular street  The pikemen were formerly considered as of a rank inferior to the national guards who are armed with muskets but of late they are put on a foot∣ing and do duty together but still it might have been expected that this gentleman's rank in the army would have commanded the strongest marks of respect from a common soldier if his laced coat failed to produce them in a poor fellow almost in rags  "Tenez mon camarade" said the pikeman  you will first turn to the right and then walk straight on until c  The officer having heard the directions returned thanks to the Citoyen Soldat and moving his hat walked away  An extract from the Examination of James Harrington wh  n confined in the Tower by the Earl of Lauder∣dale  c  Har  MY Lord in the preamble you charge me with being eminent in principles contrary to the king's government and the laws of this nation Some my lord▪ have aggravated this saying▪ that  I being a private man have been so mad as to meddle with politics what had a private man to do with government  My Lord there is not any public person not any magistrate that has writ∣ten in the politics worth a button All that have been excellent in this way have been private men my lord▪ as myself There is  Plat  there is  Aris∣totle  there is  Livi  there is  Machiavel  My Lord I can sum up  Aristotle's politics  in a very few words he says there is the  barbarous  monarchy such a one where the people have no voices in making the laws he says there is the heroic monarchy such a one where the people have their votes in making the laws and then he says there is the democracy and affirms that a man CANNOT be said to have liberty but in a democracy only  My Lord Lauderdale who thus far had been very attentive at this shewed some impatience  Har  I SAY  Aristotle  says so I have not said so much And under what prince was it Was it not under  Alexander  the greatest prince then in the world I beseech you my lord did  Alexander  hang up  Aristotle  did he molest him  Livi  for a com∣monwealth is one of the fullest authors did not he write under  Agustus Coesar  did  Coesar  hang up  Livi  did he molest him  Machiavel  what a com∣monwealth's man was he but he wrote under the  Medici  when they were princes in  Florence  did they hang up  Malchiavel  or did they molest him I have done no otherwise than as the greatest poli∣ticians the king will do no otherwise than as the greatest princes But my Lord these authors had not that to say for themselves that I have I did not write under a prince I wrote under a usurper  Oliver  He having started up into the throne his officers as pretending to be for a commonwealth kept a mur∣muring at which he told them that he knew not what they meant nor themselves but let any of them shew him what they meant by a common∣wealth or that there was any such thing they should see that he sought not himself but to make good the cause Upon this some sober men came to me and told me if any man in  England  could shew what a commonwealth was it was myself Upon this persuasion I wrote and after I had written  Oliver  never answered his officers as he had done before therefore I wrote not against the king's government And for the law if the law could have punished me  Oliver  had done it therefore my writing was not obnoxious to the law After  Oliver  the Parliament said that they were a commonwealth I said they were not and proved it insomuch that the Parliament accounted me a cavalier and one that had no other design in my writing than to bring in the King and now the King first of any man makes me a roundhead  Lord  These things are out of doors if you be no plotter the King does not reflect upon your writings  Notwithstanding the apparent innocence of our author he was still detained a close prisoner many months  A SONG  Sung by Mr Meredith at Liverpool on the Anniversary of the French Revolution  O'ER the vinecover'd hills and gay regions of France  See the daystar of Liberty rise  O'er the clouds of detraction unweared advance  And hold its new course thro' the skies  An effulgence so mild with a lustre so bright  All Europe with wonder surveys  And from deserts of darkness and dungeons of night  Contends for a share of the blaze  Let Burke like a bat from its splendour retire  A splendour too strong for his eyes  Let pedants and fools his effusions admire  Intrapt in his cobwebs like flies  Shall phrenzy and sophistry hope to prevail  Where reason opposes her weight  When the welfare of millions is hung on the scale  And the balance yet trembles with fate  Ah who midst the horrors of night would abide  That can taste the pure breezes of morn  Or who that has drunk of the chrystaline tide  To the feculent flood would return  When the bosom of beauty the throbbing heart meets  Ah who can the transport decline  Or who that has tasted of liberty's sweets  The prize but with life would resign  But 'tis overhigh Heav'n the decision approves  Oppression has struggled in vain  To the hell she has form'd superstition removes  And tyranny bites his own chain  In the records of time a new aera unfolds  All nature exalts in its birth  His creation benign the Creator beholds  And gives a new charter to earth  O catch its high import ye winds as ye blow  O bear it ye waves as ye roll  From regions that feel the sun's vertical glow  To the farthest extremes of the pole  Equal rightsequal lawsto the nations around  Peace and friendship its precepts impart  And wherever the footsteps of man shall be found  May he bind the decree on his heart  REASONS OF MONARCHY  From HARRINGTON's OCEANA  I HAVE often thought it strange that among all the governments either past or present the  monarchial  should so far in extent and number ex∣ceed the  popular  as that they could never yet come into comparison I could never be persuaded but it was more happy for a people to be disposed of by a number of persons jointly interested and concern∣ed with them than to be numbered as the herd and inheritance of one to whose lust and madness they were absolutely subject and that any man of the weak∣est reason and generosity would not rather chuse for his habitation that spot of earth where there was access to honour by virtue▪ and no worth could be excluded rather than that where all advance∣ment should proceed from the will of one scarcely hearing or seeing with his own organs and gained for the most part by means lewd and indirect and all this in the end to amount to nothing else but a more splendid and dangerous slavery  He knows nothing that knows not how super∣stitiously the generality of mankind is given to retain traditions and how pertinacious they are in the maintenance of their first prejudices insomuch that a discovery or more refined reason is as insup∣portable to them as the sun is to an eye newly brought out of darkness Hence opinionativeness which is commonly proportioned to their igno∣rance  and a generous obstinacy sometimes to death and ruin So that it is no wonder if we see many gentlemen whose education enabled them only to use their senses and first thoughts so dazzled with the splendour of a court prepossessed with the affection of a prince or bewitched with some sub∣dalous favour that they chose rather any hazard than the enchantment should be dissolved Others perhaps a degree above these yet in respect of some title stuck upon the family which has been as for∣tunate a mystery of kingcraft as any other or in re∣verence to some glorious former atchievments mind∣ing not that in all these cases  the people are the only effective means  and the king only imaginary think they should degenerate from bravery in bringing on a change Others are withheld by sloth and timorousness either not daring or unwilling to be happy some looking no further than their pri∣vate welfare indifferent at the multiplication of public evils others and these the worst of all out of a pravity of nature sacrificing to their ambition and avarice and in order to that following any pow∣er concurring with any machinations and sup∣porting their authors while princes themselves trained up in these arts or receiving them by tra∣dition know how to wind all their humours to their own advantage now foisting the divinity of their titles into pulpits now amusing the people with pomp and shows now diverting their hot spirits to some unprofitable foriegn war making way to their accursed ends of revenge or glory with the effusion of that blood which should be as dear to them as their own now stroking the people with some feeble but inforced law for which notwithstanding they will be paid and it is observed the most notorious tyrants have taken this course now giving up the eminentest of of their ministers which they part with as indifferently as their robes to the rage and fury of the people so that they are commanded and condemned by the same  mouth and the credulous and ignorant believing their king divinely set over them sit still and by degrees grow into quiet and admiration especially if lulled asleep with some small continuance of peace be it ever so injust unsound or dangerous as if the body politic could not languish of an internal disease though its complexion be fresh and cheerful Those are the reason which if I conceive aright have stupified the less knowing part of mankind  THE FREE NOTIONS OF THE ENGLISH  FROM THE PERSIAN LETTERS  ALL the nations of Europe are not under equal subjection to their princes for instance the impatient humour of the  English  seldom gives the king leisure to extend or strengthen his authority Submission and obedience are virtues they very lit∣tle value themselves upon They hold very ex∣traordinary opinions about this article According to them there is but one tie that has any effect upon men which is that of gratitude a husband a wife a father a son are bound to each other by nothing but either the love they bear to each other or mu∣tual services and benefits and these various mo∣tives of acknowledgement are the origin of all kingdoms and all societies  But if a prince instead of endeavouring to make his subjects happy studies only how to oppress and destroy them the foundation of obedience ceases nothing ties nothing obliges them to him and they return to their natural liberty They maintain that no unlimited power can be lawful because it could never have a lawful beginning For we cannot say they give to another more power over us than we have over ourselves Now we have not an unli∣mited power over ourselves for instance we can∣not touch our own lives no man upon earth there∣fore conclude they can have such a power  High treason according to them is nothing but a crime committed by the weaker against the  stronger by disobeying him let him disobey him in what way he will And accordingly the people of  England  happening to prove the stronger in a con∣tention with one of their kings declared it to be high treason in a prince to make war upon his sub∣jects They have very good reason therefore to say that the precept in their Alcoran which en∣joins obedience to the powers is not very hard to follow since they cannot help following it if they would in as much as it is not to the most virtu∣ous that they are bound to submit but to the strongest  The  English  tell you that one of their kings hav∣ing overcome and taken a prince that rebelled against him and disputed the crown with him and upbraiding him with his treachery and perfidious∣nessIt has been decided but a moment an∣swered the unfortunate prince which of us two is the traitor  ON LOYALTY FROM CATO'S LETTERS  NO good prince will pretend that there is any loyalty due to him further than he himself is loyal to the law and observant of his people the makers of kings and of laws If any man mis∣led by sound and delusion doubt this let him con∣sider what is the design of magistracy and what the duty of magistrates and if he has reason in him he will find that his duty is only due to those who perform theirs That protection and allegiance are reciprocal that every man has a right to de∣fend what no man has a right to take That the di∣vine right of kings if they had it can only warrant them in doing actions that are divine and cannot protect them in cruelty depredation and oppres∣sion That a divine right to act wickedly is a con∣tradiction and blasphemy as it is  Maledictio Supremi Numinis  a reproach upon the Deity as if he gave  any man a commission to be a devil That a king in comparison with the universe is not so much as a mayor of a town in comparison of a kingdom and that were Mr Mayor called  king  it would give him no new right or if a king were only called Mr Mayor it would not lesson nor abro∣gate his old jurisdiction That they are both civil officers and that an offence in the lesser is more pardonable than an offence in the greater That the doctrines of unbroken hereditary right and blind obedience are the flights and forgeries of flatterers who belie Heaven and abuse men to make their own court to power and that not one of them will stand the trial himself in fine that government honest and legal government is  im∣perium legum non hominum  the authority of law and not of lust  These are the principles upon which our go∣vernment stands the principles upon which every free government must stand and that we  Britons  dare tell such truths and publish such principles is a glorious proof of our civil and religious free∣dom They are truths which  every Briton  ought to know even children and servants They are eternal truths that will remain for ever though in too many countries they are dangerous or useless or little known  Before I have done I would take notice of another mistake very common concerning loyal∣ty It is indeed a trick more than a mistake I mean of those who would assert or rather create a sort of LOYALTY TO MINISTERS and make every thing which they do not like an offence against their master  FROM SWIFT's WORKS AN UNPLEASANT LESSON FOR THE PIGS' BETTERS  I HAD the curiosity to enquire in a particular manner by what method great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour and  prodigious estates and I confined my enquiry to a very modern period However without granting upon present times because I would be sure to give no offence even to foreigners for I hope the reader need not be told that I do not in the least intend my own country in what I say upon this occasion and a great number of persons were called up and upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy that I cannot reflect upon it with∣out some seriousness Perjury oppression subbr∣nation fraud pandarism and the like  infirmities  were amongst the most excuseable arts they had to maintain and for these I gave as it was reasonable great allowance But when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy or in∣cest others to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betraying of their country or their prince some to poisoning more to the perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent I hope I may be pardoned if these dis∣coveries inclined me a little to abate of that pro∣found veneration which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of HIGH rank who ought to be treated with the  utmost  respect due to their sublime digni∣ty by  us  their  inferiors  LESSONS FOR THE MONOPOLIZERS OF LAND  Lesson I  Lev  Chap xxvAnd thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years  Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound  on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye  make the trumpet sound throughout all your land  And ye shall hallow the fiftieth  year and  proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inkabitants thereof  It shall be a  Jubilee  unto you  And ye shall return every man unto his possession  and ye shall return every man unto his family A  Jubilee  shall that fiftieth yeer be unto you You shall not sow nor reap that which groweth of it∣self in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed For it is the  Jubilee  it shall be holy unto you Ye shall eat the encrease thereof out of the field  In the year of the Jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession  The land  shall not  be sold  for ever  For the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me And  in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land  If thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold And if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it  that he may return unto his possession  But if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that bought until the year of  jubilee  and  in the jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession  Lesson II  Isaiah  v Woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth  ON EQUALITY  From Puffendorf's Whole Duty of Man according to the Law of Nature  MAN is a creature not only most solicitous for the preservation of himself but has of him∣self so nice an estimation and value that to dimi∣nish  any thing thereof does frequently move in him as great indignation as if a mischief were done to his body or estate Nay there seems to him to be somewhat of dignity in the appellation of MAN so that the last and most efficacious argu∣ment to curb the arrogance of insulting men is  suallyI am not a dog but a man as well as your∣self Since then human nature is the same in us all and since no man will or can cheerfully join in society with any by whom he is not at least to be esteemed equal as a man and as a partaker of the same common nature It follows that among those duties which men owe to each other this ob∣tains the second place That every man esteem and treat another as naturally equal to himself or as one who is a man as well as he  Now this equality of mankind does not alone consist in this that men of ripe age have almost the same strength or if one be weaker he may be able to kill the stronger either by treachery or dex∣terity or by being better furnished with weapons but in this that though nature may have accom∣plished one man beyond another with various endowments of body and mind yet nevertheless he is obliged to an observation of the precepts of the lawnatural towards the meaner person after the same manner as he himself expects the same  on others and has not therefore any greater li∣berty given him to insult upon his fellows As on the other side the niggardliness of nature or fortune cannot of themselves set any man so low as that he shall be in a worse condition as to the enjoyment of common right than others But what one man may rightfully demand or expect from as another the same is due to others also cir∣cumstancies being alike from him and whatsoever one shall deem reasonable to be done by others the like it is most just he practise himself For the obligation of maintaining sociality among mankind  equally binds every man neither may one man more than another violate the law of nature in any part Not but that there are other popular reasons which illustrate this equality to wit That we are all descended of the same stock that we are all born nourished and die after the same manner and that God has not given any of us a certain assurance that our happy condition in this world shall not at one time or other be changed Besides the precepts of the Christian religion tell us that God favours not man for his nobility power or wealth but for sincere piety which may as well be found in a mean and humble man as in those of high degree  Now from this equality it follows That he who would use the assistance of others in promoting his own advantage ought to be as free and ready to use his power and abilities for their service when they want his help and assistance on like occasions For he who requires that other men should do him kindnesses and expects himself to be free from doing the like must be of opinion that those other men are below himself and not his equals Hence as those persons are the best members of a commu∣nity who without any difficulty allow the same things to their neighbours that themselves require of him so those are altogether incapable of socie∣ty who setting a high rate on themselves in re∣gard to others will take upon them to act any thing towards their neighbour and expect greater deference and more respect than the rest of man∣kind and in their insolent manner demanding a greater portion unto themselves of those things to which all men having a common right they can in reason claim no larger share than other men Whence this also is an univerfal duty of the law∣natural That no man who has not a peculiar right ought to arrogate more to himself than he is ready to allow to his fellows but that he permit other men to enjoy equal privileges with himself  The same e quality also shews what every man's behaviour ought to be when his business is to dis∣tribute justice among others to wit that he treat them as equals and indulge not that unless the merits of the cause require it to one which he dentes to another For if he do otherwise he who is discountenanced is at the same time affronted and wronged and loses somewhat of the dignity which nature bestowed upon him Whence it follows that things which are in common are of right to be divided by equal parts among those who are equal Where the thing will not admit of di∣vision they who are equally concerned are to use it indifferently and if the quantity of the thing will bear it as much as each party shall think fit But if this cannot be allowed then it is to be used after a stated manner and proportioned to the number of the claimants because it is not possible to find out any other way of observing equality But if it be a thing of that nature as not to be capable of being divided nor of being pos∣sessed in common then it must be used by turns and if this yet will not answer the point and it is not possible the rest should be satisfied by an equi∣valent the best way must be to determine posses∣sion by lot for in such cases no fitter method can be thought on to remove all opinion of partiality and contempt of any party without debasing the person whom fortune does not favour  ON THE ABSURDITY OF UNALTERA∣BLE ESTABLISHMENTS FROM PRIESTLY ON GOVERNMENT  HIGHLY as we think of the wisdom of our ancestors we justly think ourselves of the presentage wiser and if we be not blinded by  the prejudice of education must see that we can in many respects improve upon the institutions they have transmitted to us Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political and in all kinds of knowledge and that they will be able to im∣prove upon the best civil institutions that we can prescribe for them Instead then of adding to the difficulties which we ourselves find in making the improvements we wish to introduce let us make this great and desireable work easier to them than it has been to us  However such is the progress of knowledge and the enlargement of the human mind that in future time notwithstanding all obstructions thrown in the way of human genius men of great and exalted views will undoubtedly arise who will see through and detest our narrow politics when the illadvisers and illadvised authous of these illiberal and contracted schemes will be re∣membered with infamy and execration When notwithstanding their talents as statesmen or wri∣ters and though they may have pursued the same mind enslaving schemes by more artful and less sanguinary methods they will be ranked among the Bonners and Gardeners of past ages they must have been worse than Bonners and Garden∣ers who could pursue the same ends by the same means in this more humane and more enlighten∣ed age  England hath hitherto taken the lead in almost every thing great and good and her citizens stand foremost in the annals of fame as having shaken off the fetters which hung upon the human mind and called it forth to the exertion of its noblest powers And her constitution has been so far from receiving any injury from the efforts of these her freeborn enterprising sons that she is in part indebted to them for the unrivalled repu∣tation  she now enjoys of having the best system of policy in Europe After weathering so many real storms let us not quit the helm at the appre∣hension of imaginary dangers but steadily hold on in what I trust is the most glorious course that a government can be in Let all the friends of li∣berty and human nature join to free the minds of men from the shackles of narrow and impolitic laws Let us be free ourselves and leave the blessings of freedom to our posterity  In short it seems to have been the intention of Divine Providence that mankind should be as far as possible selftaught that we should attain to every thing excellent and useful as the result of our own experience and observation that our judgment should be formed by the appearances which are presented to them and our hearts in∣structed by their own feelings But by the unna∣tural system of rigid unalterable establishments we put it out of our power to instruct ourselves or to derive any advantage from the lights we ac∣quire from experience and observation and there∣by as far as in our power we counteract the kind intentions of the Deity in the constitution of the world and in providing for a state of constant though slow improvement in every thing  In spite of all the fetters we can lay upon the human mind notwithstanding all possible discou∣ragements in the way of free enquiry knowledge of all kinds will encrease The wisdom of one generation will be folly in the next And that though we have seen this verified in the history of near two thousand years we persist in the absurd maxim of making a preceding generation dictate to a succeeding one which is the same thing as making the foolish instruct the wise for what is a lower degree of wisdom but comparatively folly  Were any more laws restraining the liberty of the press in force it is impossible to say how far  they might be construed to extend Those already in being are more than are requisite and inconsist∣ent with the interests of truth Were they to ex∣tend further every author would lie at the mercy of the ministers of state who might condemn in∣discriminately upon some pretence or other every work that gave them umbrage under such cir∣cumstances might fall some of the greatest and noblest productions of the human mind if such works could be produced in those circumstances For if men of genius knew they could not pub∣lish the discoveries they made they would not give free scope to their faculties in making and pursuing those discoveries It is the thought of publication and the prospect of fame which is generally the great incentive to men of genius to exert their faculties in attempting the untrodden paths of speculation In those unhappy circum∣stances writers would entertain a dread of every new subject No man could safely indulge him∣self in any thing bold enterprising and out of the vulgar road and in all publications we should see a timidity incompatable with the spirit of disco∣very If any towering genius should arise in those unfavourable circumstances a Newton in the na∣tural world or a Locke a Hutchinson a Clarke or a Harley in the moral the only effectual method to prevent their defusing a spirit of enterprize or innovation which is natural to such great souls could be no other than that which Tarquin so sig∣nificantly expressed by taking off the heads of all those poppies which overlooked the rest Such men could not but be dangerous and give umbrage in a country where it was the maxim of the go∣vernment that every thing of importance should for ever remain unalterably fixed  GENERAL POLITICAL APHORISMS OR MAXIMS FROM HARRINGTON'S WORKS  TO leave ourselves and posterity to a farther purchase in blood and sweat of that which we may presently possess enjoy and hereafter bequeath to posterity in peace and glory is inhu∣man and impious  As certainly and suddenly as a good state of health dispels the peevishness and peril of sickness does a good state of government the animosity and danger of parties  The frame of a commonwealth having been first proposed and considered expedients in case such should be found necessary for the safe effectual and perfect introduction of the same may with some aim be applied and fitted as to a house when the model is resolved upon we fit scaffolds in build∣ing But first to resolve upon expedients and then to fit to them the frame of a commonwealth is as if one should set up props and then build a house to lean upon them  While the civil and religious parts of a common∣wealth are in forming there is a necessity that she should be supported by an army but when the military and provincial parts are rightly formed she can have no farther use of any other army Wherefore at this point and not till then her armies are by the practice of commonwealths upon slighter occasions to have half pay for life and to be disbanded  Where there is a standing army and not a formed government there the army of necessity will have dictatorian power  Where an army subsists upon the pay or riches of a single person or of a nobility that army is always monarchical Where an army subsists not by the riches of a single person nor of a nobility that army is always popular  The reason why the nations that have common∣wealths use them so well and cherish them so much and yet that so few nations have common∣wealths is that in using a commonwealth it is not necessary it should be understood but in mak∣ing a commonwealth that it be understood is of absolute necessity  It shall be as soon found when and where the soul of a man was in the body of a beast as when or where the soul or freedom natural to democracy was in any other form than that only of a senate and an assembly of the people  As the soul of man can never be in the body of a beast unless God make a new creation so nei∣ther the soul or freedom natural to democracy in any other form whatsoever than that only of a se∣nate and a popular assembly  To the making of a well ordered commonwealth there goes little more of pains or charge or work without doors than the establishment of an equal or apt division of the territory and the proposing of such election to the divisions so made as from an equal foundation may raise equal superstruc∣tures the rest being but paper work is as soon done as said or voted  The highest earthly felicity that a people can ask or God can give is an equal and well ordered com∣monwealth Such a one among the  Israelites  was the reign of GOD and such a one for the same reason may be among  Christians  the reign of CHRIST though not every one in the  Christian  commonwealth should be any more a  Christian  indeed than every one in the  Israelitish  commonwealth was an  Israelite  indeed  ADDRESS AND DECLARATION OF THE  FRIENDS of Universal PEACE and LIBERTY' Held at the Thatched House Tavern St James'sstreet August    Friends and Fellow Citizens  AT a moment like the present when wilful misrepresentations are industriously spread by the partizans of arbitrary power and the advocates of passive obedience and CourtGovernment we think it incumbent upon us to declare to the world our principles and the motives of our conduct  We rejoice at the glorious event of the  French Revolution  If it be askedWhat is the French Revolution to us  We answer  It is much  Much to us as men Much to us as Englishmen  As men we rejoice in the freedom of twentyfive millions of our fellow men We rejoice in the prospect which such a magnificent example opens to the world We congratulate the French nation for having laid the axe to the root of tyranny and for erecting Government on the sacred HEREDI∣TARY Rights of MANRights which appertain to ALL and not to any one more than to anotherWe know of no human authority superior to that of a whole nation and we profess and proclaim it as our principle that every nation has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to constitute and establish such Government for itself as best ac∣cords with its disposition interest and happiness  As Englishmen we also rejoice because we are  immediately  interested in the French Revolution  Without enquiring into the justice on either side of the reproachful charges of intrigue and am∣bition  which the English and French courts have constantly made on each other we confine our∣selves to this observationThat if the Court of France only was in fault and the numerous wars which have distressed both countries are chargea∣ble to her alone that Court now exists no longer and the cause and the consequence must now cease together The French therefore by the Revolu∣tion they have made have conquered for us as well as for themselves if it be true that their Court only was in fault and ours never  On this state of the case the French Revolution concerns us  immediately  We are oppressed with a heavy National debt a burthen of taxes and an expensive administration of Government beyond those of any people in the world We have also a very numerous poor and we hold that the moral obligation of providing for old age helpless infan∣cy and poverty is far superior to that of supply∣ing the invented wants of courtly extravagance ambition and intrigue  We believe there is no instance to be produced but in England of  seven  millions of inhabitants which make but little more than  one  million of fa∣milies paying yearly SEVENTEEN MILLIONS of taxes  As it has always been held out by all adminis∣trations that the restless ambition of the Court of France rendered this expence necessary to us for our own defence we consequently rejoice as men deeply interested in the French Revolution for that Court as we have already said exists no longer and consequently the same enormous expences need not continue to us  Thus rejoicing as we sincerely do both as men and Englishmen as lovers of universal peace and freedom and as friends to our national prosperity and a reduction of our public expences we can∣not but express our astonishment that any part or  any members of our own government should re∣probate the extinction of that very power in France or wish to see it restored to whose influence they formerly attributed whilst they appeared to la∣ment the enormous increase of our own burthens and taxes What then Are they sorry that the pretence for new oppressive taxes and the occasion for continuing many old taxes will be at an end If so and if it is the policy of Courts and Court Government to prefer enemies to friends and a system of war to that of peace as affording more pretences for Places Offices Pensions Revenue and Taxation it is high time for the people of every nation to look with circumspection to their own interest  Those who pay the expence and not those who  participate  in the emoluments arising from it are the persons immediately interested in enquiries of this kind We are a part of that National body on whom this annual expence of seventeen millions falls and we consider the present opportunity of the French Revolution as a most happy one for les∣sening the enormous load under which this nation groans If this be not done we shall then have reason to conclude that the cry of intrigue and ambition against  other  Courts is no more than the common cant of  all  Courts  We think it also necessary to express our asto∣nishment that a Government desirous of being called FREE should prefer connections with the most despotic and arbitrary powers in Europe We know of none more deserving this description than those of Turkey and Prussia and the whole combination of German despotsSeparated as we happily are by nature from the tumults of the con∣tinent we reprobate all systems and intrigues which sacrifice and that too at a great expence the bles∣sings of our natural situationSuch systems can∣not have a national origin  If we are asked What Government isWe hold it to be nothing more than  a National Association  end we hold that to be the best which secures to every man his rights and promotes the greatest quantity of happiness with the  least expence  We live to improve or we live in vain and therefore we admit of no maxims of government or policy on the mere score of antiquity or other men's authority the  Old Whigs or the New  We will exercise the reason with which we are endowed or we possess it unworthily As reason is given at all times it is for the purpose of being used at all times  Among the blessings which the French Revolu∣tion has produced to that nation we enumerate the abolition of the feudal system of injustice and tyranny on the th of August Beneath the feudal system all Europe has long groaned and from it England is not yet free Game laws bo∣roughtenures and tyrannical monopolies of nu∣merous kinds still remain amongst us but rejoic∣ing as we sincerely do in the freedom of others till we shall happily accomplish our own we intend∣ed to commemorate this prelude to the universal extirpation of the feudal system by meeting on the anniversary of that day the th of August at the Crown and Anchor From this meeting we were prevented by the interference of certain  un∣named  and  sculking  persons with the Master of the Tavern who informed us that on  their  represen∣tations he could not receive usLet those who live by or countenance feudal oppressions take the reproach of this ineffectual meanness and cow∣ardice to themselves They connot stifle the pub∣lic declaration of our honest open and avowed opinions  These are our principles and these our senti∣ments They embrace the interest and happiness of the great body of the nation of which we are a  part As to riots and tumults let those answer for them who by wilful misrepresentations en∣deavour to excite and promote them or who feek to  stun  the sense of the nation and lose the great cause of public good in the outrages of a misinformed mob We take our ground on prin∣ciples that require no such riotous aid We have nothing to apprehend from the poor for we are pleading their cause And we fear not proud oppression for we have truth on our side  We say and we repeat it that the French Re∣volution opens to the world an opportunity in which all good citizens must rejoice that of pro∣moting the general happiness of man And that  moreover offers to this country in particular an opportunity of reducing our enormous taxes  These are our objects and we will pursue them  JOHN HORNE TOOKE Chairman  LESSONS FOR STATESMEN  Lesson IFROMCOMMERCE IN THE ENCYCLO∣PADIA BRITANNICA  THE augmentation of riches in a country either not capable of improvement as to the soil or where precautions have not been taken for facilitating a multiplication of inhabitants by the importation of subsistence will be productive of the most calamitous circumstances  On one side this wealth will effectually dimi∣nish the mass of food before produced and on the other will encrease the number of useless con∣sumers The first of these circumstances will raise the demand for food and the second will diminish the number of useful free hands and consequently raise the price of manufactures here are shortly the outlines of this progress  The more rich and luxurious a people are the more delicate they become in their manner of liv∣ing if they fed on bread formerly they will now feed on meat if they fed on meat they will now feed on fowl The same ground which feeds an hundred with bread and a proportionable quantity of animal food will not maintain an equal number of delicate livers Food must then become more scarce demand for it rises the rich are always the strongest in the market they con∣sume the food and the poor are forced to starve Here the wide door to modern distress opens to wit a hurtful competition for subsistence Farther when a people become rich they think less of occonomy a number of useless servants are hired to become an additional dead weight on consump∣tion and when their starving countrymen cannot supply the extravagance of the rich so cheaply as other nations they either import instruments of foreign luxury or seek to enjoy them out of their own country  Lesson IIFROM THE SAME  ASET of industrious and frugal people were assembled in a country Holland by nature subject to many inconveniencies the removing of which necessarily employed abundance of hands Their situation upon the continent the power of their former masters and the ambition of their neighbours obliged them to keep great bodies of troops These two articles added to the numbers of the community without either enriching the state by their labour exported or producing food for themselves or countrymen  The scheme of a commonwealth was calculated to draw together the industrious but it has been still more useful in subsisting them the republi∣can form of government being there greatly sub∣divided vests authority sufficient in every part of  it to make suitable provision for their own sub∣sistence and the tie which unites them regards only matters of public concern Had the whole been governed by one sovereign or by one coun∣cil this important matter never could have been effectuated  It would be impossible for the most able minis∣ter that ever lived to provide nourishment for a country so extensive as France or even as En∣gland supposing those as fully peopled as Holland is even though it should be admitted that a suf∣ficient quantity of food might be found in other countries for their subsistence The enterprize would be too great abuses would multiply the consequence would be that the inhabitants would die for want But in Holland the case is different every little town takes care of its own inhabi∣tants and this care being the object of applica∣tion and profit to so many persons is accomplish∣ed with success  Lesson III  From Lady Montague's Letters  IT is impossible not to observe the difference be∣tween the free towns and those under the go∣vernment of absolute princes as all the little sovereigns of Germany are In the first there ap∣pears an air of commerce and plenty The streets are well built and full of people neatly and plainly dressed The shops are loaded with mer∣chandize and the commonality are clean and chear∣ful In the other you see a fort of shabby finery a number of dirty people of quality tawdred out narrow nasty streets out of repair wretchedly thin of inhabitants and above half of the common sort asking alms I cannot help fancying one under the figure of a clean Dutch Citizen's wife and the other like a poor town lady of pleasure painted and ribboned out in her head dress with tarnished silverlaced shoes a ragged underpetticoat a mise∣rable mixture of vice and poverty  We take care to make such short stages every day that I rather fancy myself upon parties of pleasure than upon the road and sure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland The whole country appears a large garden the roads are all paved▪ shaded on each side with rows of trees and bordered with large canals full of boats passing and repassing Every twenty paces gives you the prospect of some villa and every four hours that of a large town so surprisingly neat I am sure you would be charmed with them  My arrival at Rotterdam▪ presented me a new scene of pleasure All the streets are paved with broad stones and before many of the meanest arti∣ficer's doors are placed seats of various coloured marbles so neatly kept that I assure you I walk∣ed almost all over the town yesterday incognito in my slippers without one spot of dirt and you may see the Dutch maids washing the pavement of the street with more application than ours do our bedchambers The town seems so full of people with such busy faces and all in motion that I can hardly fancy it is not some celebrated fair but I see it every day the same It is certain no town can be more advantageously situated for commerce Here are seven large canals on which the mer∣chants' ships come up to the very doors of their houses The shops and warehouses are of a very surprizing neatness and magnificence filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandize and so much cheaper than what we see in England that I have much ado to persuade myself I am still so near it Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be seen One is not shocked with those loathsome cripples so common in London nor teazed with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches that chuse to be nasty and lazy The common servants and little shopwomen here are more nicely clean than most of our ladies and the great variety of  neat dresses every woman dressing her head after her own fashion is an additional pleasure in see∣ing the towns  ACCOUNT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GENEVA BY D'ALEMBERT  IT is very remarkable that a city which con∣tains scarce inhabitants and whose scat∣tered territory consists not of thirty villages should be a sovereign state and one of the most flourishing cities of Europe enriched by her li∣berty and her commerce she frequently beholds every thing around her in flames without having any share in the calamity The events which disturb the rest of Europe afford her only an amnsing spectacle which she observes without tak∣ing any part in them Attached to France by treaties and by commerce to England by com∣merce and religion she is too prudent to interest herself in the wars that embroil these two power∣ful nations she pronounces with impartiality upon the justice of their contests and judges all the so∣vereigns of Europe without flattering injuring or fearing them  The city is well fortified particularly on the side of that prince from whom it has most to fear the King of Sardinia On the side of France it is almost open and defenceless but discipline is kept up as in a military place the arsenals and maga∣zines well furnished every citizen is a soldier as in Switzerland and ancient Rome the Genevois are allowed to go into foreign service but the re∣public does not furnish any state with regular bo∣dies of men nor does it suffer an inrolment with∣in its own territories  Though the individuals are rich the government is poor from that aversion which the people shew to new taxes how little burdensome soever The revenues of the state do not amount to  livres of French money and yet by the admirable oeconomy with which they are managed they are sufficient and even afford a surplus for extraor∣dinary emergencies  Hereditary dignity is unknown at Geneva the sons of the first magistrate are lost in the crowd till their own merit distinguishes them nobility and riches confer neither rank nor privilege nor give any facility of advancement to the offices of the state All solicitation for places is strictly prohi∣bited Public employments are so little lucrative that they afford no temptations for the avaricious they are objects only to nobler minds by the con∣sideration and respect they procure  Few disputes come to a legal trial they are ge∣nerally adjusted by common friends by the advo∣cates themselves and by the judges  Their sumptuary laws forbid the use of jewels and embroidery limit the expence of funerals and oblige all the citizens to walk on foot in the streets carriages being allowed only in the country These laws which are regarded in France as too se∣vere nay almost barbarous and inhuman by no means abridge the real conveniences of life which are always to be obtained at little expence they retrench only the pageantry of it which contri∣butes not to happiness and often produces ruin without any advantage  There is perhaps no where so many happy marriages Geneva has in this respect the start of our manners at least two centuriesThe re∣straints upon luxury remove the fear of a multi∣tude of children and by this means luxury is not as in France one of the greatest obstacles to population  Geneva has an university which they call an academy where youth are educated without ex∣pence The professors are eligible to offices of stateMany of them have become magistrates and this privilege contributes much to keep up the emulation and same of the academy  Their public library is a well chosen collection of books consisting of twentysix thousand vo∣lumes and a great number of manuscripts The books are lent to all the citizens every one reads and informs himself and by this means the peo∣ple of Geneva are better instructed than any where else They find none of those inconveniencies which we suppose would follow the same indul∣gence among us perhaps the Genevois and our politicians may be both in the right  All the sciences and most of the arts have been cultivated with so much success at Geneva that it is surprizing to see the list of learned men and ar∣tists of every kind which this city has produced within the last two agesIt has even had the good fortune sometimes to be the residence of celebrated strangers whom its agreable situation and the liberty it enjoys have invited to retire thither M de Voltaire who has resided there for the last seven years finds among these republicans the same marks of esteem and consideration which he has received from so many monarchs  The eccle  astical constitution of Geneva is pure Presbyterianism no bishops nor canonsNot that they disapprove of episcopacy but as they have no faith in the divine right of bishops they think Pas∣tors not quite so rich and important as bishops agree better with a small republic  The ministers are either pastors like our parish priests or postulans as our priests without bene∣fice The revenue of the pastors does not amount to above livres without any casual profits The state makes this allowanceThe church has nothing  The speech of Charles Turner Esq Member of Parlia∣ment for the City of York to the Electors of West∣minster from the Hustings in Westminster Hall on Thursday the th of April    I FEEL a satisfaction in addressing so numerous and respectable a body of my countrymen that  cannot be animated by a slavish mind I have ever opposed the torrent of corruption and the inroads of arbitrary power and though I have been unsuccessful yet with your assistance I will fight and conquer Corruption and tyranny can never stand against the virtuous efforts of a free people be firm be resolute and unanimous assert your birthright Annual Parliaments and an equal representation are privileges inherent in the constitution but if you do not

people If you chuse to be slaves you may submit to an unlimited monarchy or an oppressive aristocracy if you wish to be free you have a right to insist on a de∣mocracy or  you have a right to form a republic  Don't tell me of the power of Parliament or the power of the Crown all power originates with yourselves and if the Crown or the Parliament abuse that power you have invested them with you have a right to reassume it you are the lords of the creation not the slaves of power you are the masters and we are only your servants delegated and employed by you to do your business and till you pay your servants as was anciently the custom they will never act to your advantage if you do not pay them the Crown will and then they be∣come the servants of the Crown and no longer the servants of the people An honest man can have no interest but that of his country in coming to parliament and if he sacrifices his ease and retire∣ment to the duty of a senator his expences at least ought to be reimbursed by his country You now pay your members with a vengeance for enslav∣ing you and picking your pockets but if you would once pay them yourselves you would no longer complain of oppression Act with spirit  and resolution insist upon your privileges and I will meet you at Runny Mead I love the poor I divide my fortune with them and I will die with them the poor man's labour is the rich man's wealth and without your toil a kingdom would be worth nothing While I am free you never shall be slaves  God bless the People  Observations of Charles Turner Esq Member of Par∣liament for the City of York in the Debate in the House of Commons April    on the Bill for preventing Revenue Officers from voting at Elections  HE contended that the House was bound to pass the Bill that they must do it the people of England had petitioned for it and who would gainsay the people of England They would have their way they had a right to it for the constitution of this country was a republic He repeated it he said in the face of all the Crown lawyers and let them make the most of it a republic and one of the finest in the world He had held this language to the people in Westminster Hall and he would hold it every where Where the Monarch was limited by the same laws which governed the subject it certainly was a republic and nothing else  A LESSON FOR VENAL PARLIAMENTS  The  Speech  that was spoken by  OLIVER CROMWELL'  when he dissolved the Long Parliament  IT is high time for me to put an end to your sit∣ting in this place which you have dishonoured by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice Ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government Ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like  Esau  sell your country for a mess of pottage and like  Judas  be∣tray  your GOD for a few pieces of money Is there a single virtue now remaining amongst you Is there one vice you do not possess Ye have no more religion than my horse Gold is your God Which of you have not bartered your conscience for bribes Is there a man amongst you that has the least care for the good of the commonwealth Ye sordid prostitutes have ye not defiled this sacred place and turned the Lord's temple into a den of thieves by your immoral principles and wicked practices Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation You were deputed here by the people to get grievances redressed are not yourselves become the greatest grievance Your country therefore calls upon me to cleanse this Augean stable by putting a final period to your iniquitous proceedings in this House and which by God's help and the strength he has given me I am now come to do I command ye therefore upon the peril of your lives to depart immediately out of this place Go get ye out make haste ye venal slaves be gone So take away that shining bauble there and lock up the doors  THE INHABITANTS OF HELL  From a Pamphlet entitled "The Rights of the Devil"  THESE that is the priests are the most nu∣merous of all Lucifer's subjects except the military for next to the clergy the military are the most devoted which may be seen by the ardor they discover on all occasions in the service of their grand master and monarch Lucifer Nothing diminishes the zeal of soldiers no hardships or calamities can intimidate them from the pursuit of their master's interest Captivity prisons fetters chains slavery or death give no check to their activity but havock and devastation are the works  of their hands See how these heroes leave every thing near and dear behind them Their trades are nothing in comparison to the intrinsic acquisitions of the soldier who sacrifices every thing to the pleasure of murdering his fellowcreatures How many of these English  Sans Culottes  have left twentyfive and even thirty shillings per week within these six months past to gain in return six∣pence a day to be food for gunpowder and to distinguish themselves as the best friends and warmest advocates for Satan's kingdom Mark what disinterestedness Surely Lucifer has some right to such property as this Only examine their fa  es and their figures both will declare to you whom they serve and whose they are Their pole complexions their tawny countenances their tanned hides in short the whole of their meagre bodies have more the appearance of carcases or ske∣letons than of human figures Their bodies I say loaded with wounds exhausted by labours which they have undergone with distempers which con∣sume them with vermin which gnaw them while alive with hunger which devours them with ex∣cessive heat and rigorous cold which they expe∣rience and endure with courage and delight for a poor and wretched stipend plainly shew that the most powerful and predominant of all their pas∣sions is their desire for the infernal regions And this is further confirmed by the ardent exclama∣tions with which they conclude every sentence they pronounce such as The Devil take me The Devil seize me The Devil choak me The Devil fly away with me c c Which ejacula∣tions certainly express their earnest wish to go to Lucifer's kingdom The Devil will never deny his right to such property as they are  I had like to have omitted informing you that the military are accompanied with their officers even in Hell and why not They are fond of  leading the dance with them on Earth and surely ought to partake of their pleasures in Hell They are led by their officers by thousands every day with colours flying music playing and drums beating amidst the acclamations of all who see them on their journey to Pluto's regions There is no exception of persons in the military they go unanimously hand in hand There you see them travelling in social union with wonderful contrast generalissimo and private general and drummer duke and corporal prince and serjeant kings and serjeantmajors emperors and adjutants in most parts of Europe vieing with each other in their various tactical knowledge to discover who has the greatest ability in getting tenants in the greatest numbers to occupy Beelzebub's kingdom Witness the scenes now exhibiting on the other side the water what bravery is displayed by the English Dutch Prussians Austrians Hessians Ha∣noverians c of all ranks and degrees from the prince to the private in order to transport them∣selves to the infernal regions and none can be more deserving than those who take up the sword in defence of their common master for the express purpose of peopling his kingdom Go on then ye veterans hide your trusty blades in the bowels of your b  ethren your laurels will cleave to your brows in never fading and glowing colours and Satan shall crown you with everlasting honours  Ignorance the Foundation of unequal Governments and fostered by them designedly  From "Barlow's Advice to priviledged Orders"  UNEQUAL Governments are necessarily found∣ed on ignorance and they must be supported by ignorance to deviate from their principle would be voluntary suicide The great object of  their policy is to perpetuate that undisturbed igno∣rance of the people which is the companion of poverty the parent of crimes and the pillar of the state  In England the people at large are as perfectly ignorant of the acts of Parliament after they are made as they possibly can be before They are printed by one man only who is called the king's printerin the old German character which few men can readand sold at a price that few can afford to pay But lest some scraps or comments upon them should come to the people through the medium of public newspapers every such paper is stamped with a heavy duty and an act of parlia∣ment is made to prevent men from lending their papers to each other so that not one person in a hundred sees a newspaper once in a year If a man at the bottom of Yorkshire discovers by in∣stinct that a law is made which is interesting for him to know he has only to make a journey to London find out the king's printer pay a penny a page for the law and learn the German alphabet He is then prepared to spell out his duty  As to the general system of the laws of the land on which all property depends no man in the kingdom knows them and no man pretends to know them They are a fathomless abyss that exceeds all human faculties to sound They are studied not to be understood but to be disputed not to give information but to breed confusion The man whose property is depending on a suit at law dares not to look into the gulph that separates him from the wishedfor decision he has no con∣fidence in himself nor in reason nor in justice he mounts on the back of a lawyer like one of Mr  urke's heroes of chivalry between the wings of a gr  ffin and trusts the pilotage to a man who is su∣perior to himself only in the confidence which results from having nothing at stake  On the Injustice of taking Fees from Persons acquitted in Courts of Justice  From "The Candid Philosopher"  A MAN suspected of a felonious action is taken up sent to goal used there in a barbarous manner yet when brought to his trial is found per∣fectly innocent A man of common sense uprac∣tised in the  wisdom  of our laws would naturally imagine he would be now discharged But no such thing he must be remanded to prison to undergo the same harsh treatment he received before his trial unless he pays the  fees  that are demanded of him They are the poorest people on whom sus∣picions generally fall and who so far from being able to pay goaler's fees could scarcely maintain themselves in prison before the proof of their in∣nocence appeared How cruel therefore after punishing an innocent person with imprisonment making him lose his business and his character to  rob him of his property  under the name of  paying  feesO shame shame shame  Whether the Balance of Dominion in Land be the natural Cause of Empire  From Harrington's Oceana  IF a man having one hundred pounds a year may keep one servant or have one man at his command then having one hundred times so much he may keep one hundred servants and this multiplied by a thousand he may have one hundred thousand men at his command Now that the single person or nobility of any country in  Europe  that had but half so many men at com∣mand would be king or prince is that which I think no man will doubt But no  money  no  Switzers  as the  French  speak if the money be flown so are the men also Though riches in general have  wings and be apt to bate yet those in land are the most hooded and tied to the perch whereas those in money have the least hold and are the swiftest in flight A bank where the money takes not wing but to come home seized or like a coy duck may well be great but the treasure of the  Indies  going out and not upon returns makes no bank Whence a bank never paid an army or paying an army soon became no bank But where a prince or nobility has an estate in land the revenue whereof will defray this charge there their men are plant∣ed have toes that are roots and arms that bring forth what fruit you please  Thus a single person is made or a nobility makes a king not with difficulty or any great pru∣dence but with ease the rest coming home as the  ox that not only knows his master's crib  but must starve or repair to it Nor for the same reason is government acquired with more ease than it is pre∣served that is if the foundation of property be in land but if in morey  lightly come lightly go  The reason why a single person or the nobility that has one hundred thousand men or half so many at command will have the government is that the estate in land whereby they are able to maintain so many in any  European  territory must overbalance the rest that remains to the people at least three parts in four by which means they are no more able to dispute the government with him or them than your servant is with you Now for the same reason if the people hold three parts in four of the territory it is plain there can nei∣ther be any single person nor nobility able to dis∣pute the government with them in this case therefore except force be interposed they govern themselves So by this computation of the balance of property or dominion in land you have ac∣cording to the threefold foundation of property the root or generation of the threefold kind of go∣vernment or empire  If one man be sole landlord of a territory or overbalance the whole people three parts in four or thereabouts he is Grand Seignior for so the Turk not from his empire but his property is called and the empire in this case is absolute monarchy  If the few or a nobility or a nobility with a clergy be landlords to such a proportion as over∣balances the people in the like manner they may make whom they please king or if they be not pleased with their king down with him and set up whom they like better a HENRY the Fourth or the Seventh a GUISE a MONTFORT a NEVIL or a PORTER should they find that best for their own ends and purposes For as not the balance of the king but that of the nobility in this case is the cause of the government so not the estate or the riches of the prince or captain but his virtue or ability or fitness for the ends of the nobility acquires that command or office This for aristo∣cracy or mixed monarchy But if the whole people be landlords or hold the land so divided among them that no one man or number of men within the compass of the few or aristocracy over∣balance them it is a commonwealth Such is the branch in the root or the balance of property na∣turally producing empire which not confuted no man shall be able to batter my superstructures and which confuted I lay down my arms till then if the cause necessarily precede the effect property must have a being before empire or beginning with it must be still first in order  Property comes to have a being before empire or government two ways either by a natural or violent revolution Natural revolution happens from within or by commerce as when a govern∣ment erected upon one balance that for example of a nobility or a clergy through the decay of their estates comes to alter to another balance which  alteration in the root of property leaves all to con∣fusion or produces a new branch of government according to the kind or nature of the root Vio∣lent revolution happens from without or by arms as when upon conquest there follows confiscation Confiscation again is of three kinds when the captain taking all to himself plants his army by way of military colonies benefices or timars which was the policy of MAHOMET or when the captain has some sharers or a nobility that divides with him which was the policy introduced by the  Goths  and  Vandals  or when the captain divides the inheritance by lots or otherwise to the whole people which policy was instituted by GOD or MOSES in the commonwealth of Israel This tri∣ple distribution which from natural or violent re∣volution returns as to the generation of empire to the same thing that is to the nature of the balance already stated and demonstrated  ABRIDGMENT OF ROMAN HISTORY  ROMULUS and REMUS being sent by their grandfather Numetor from Alba at the head of a colony to seek a new settlement quarrelled about the choice of a spot where they should fix and build them a city Romulus chusing mount Palatine and Remus mount Aventine Remus is said to have lost his life in this dispute The city was therefore built on mount Palatine and in compliment to its founder called Rome As Romulus had not taken upon him the chief com∣mand of the colony for any longer time than while the city was building he as soon as the work was finished submitted the form of its future go∣vernment to the choice of the people and calling the citizens together harangued them in words to this effect  "If all the strength of cities lay in the height of their ramparts or the depth of their ditches  we should have great reason to be in fear for that which we have now built Are there in reality any walls too high to be scaled by a valiant ene∣my And of what use are ramparts in intestine divisions They may serve for a defence against sudden incursions from abroad but it is by cou∣rage and prudence chiefly that the invasions of foreign enemies are repelled and by unanimity sobriety and justice that domestic seditions are prevented Cities fortified by the strongest bul∣warks have been seen to yield to force from with∣out or to tumults from within An exact mi∣litary discipline and a steady observance of civil policy are the surest barriers against these evils But there is still another point of great importance to be considered the prosperity of some rising colonies and the speedy ruin of others have in a great measure been owing to their form of go∣vernment Was there but one manner of ruling states and cities that could make them happy the choice would not be difficult But I have learnt that of the various forms of government among the Greeks and Barbarians there are three which are highly extolled by those who have experi∣enced them and yet that no one of these is in all respects perfect but each of them has some innate and incurable defect Chuse ye then in what manner this city shall be governed Shall it be by one man Shall it be by a select number of the wisest among us or shall the legislative power be in the people As for me I shall submit to any form of adminstration you shall please to establish As I think myself not unworthy to command so neither am I unwilling to obey Your having chosen me to be the leader of this colony and your calling the city after my name are honours sufficient te content me honours of which liv∣ing or dead I can never be deprived"  Romulus was chosen king and Rome was go∣verned by kings for upwards of years till the  expulsion of Tarquin the Second which was occa∣sioned by his son Sextus ravishing Lucretia the wife of Collatinus a noble Roman Lucretia up∣on receiving this injury sent for her husband who was then in the camp at Ardea with Tarquin and for several of his friends and having informed them of the outrage she had received and engaged them to revenge it stabbed herself to the heart and died before them The Romans had long groaned under the tyranny and cruelty of the Tarquins and were therefore glad to lay hold on so flagrant and outrageous an insult to shake off their yoke The famous Junius Brutus who for some reasons had masked himself and concealed great talents under the appearance of idiotism suddenly threw off his disguise and going near to the dying lady drew the poignard out of her bosom and shewing it all bloody to the assembly to their great astonishment thus addressed them  "Yes noble lady I swear by this blood which was once so pure and which nothing but royal villainy could have polluted that I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius the Proud his wicked wife and their children with fire and sword nor will I ever suffer any of that family or of any other whatever to be king in Rome Ye Gods I call you to witness this my oathThere Romans turn your eyes to that sad spectaclethe daughter of Lucretius Collatinus's wifeshe died by her own hand See there a noble lady whom the lust of a Tarquin reduced to the necessity of being her own executioner to attest her innocence Hos∣pitably entertained by her as a kinsman of her hus∣band's Sextus the perfidious guest became her brutal ravisher The chaste the generous Lucretia could not survive the insult Glorious woman But once only treated as a slave she thought life no longer to be endured Lucretia a woman disdained a life that depended upon a tyrant's will  and shall we shall men with such an example before our eyes and after fiveandtwenty years of igno∣minous servitude shall we through a fear of dying defer one single instant to assert our liberty No Romans now is the time the favourable moment we have so long waited for is come Tarquin is not at Rome The patricians are at the head of the enter∣prize The city is abundantly provided with men arms and all things necessary There is nothing want∣ing to secure the success if our own courage does not fail us And shall those warriors who have ever been so brave when foreign enemies were to be subdued or when conquests were to be made to gratify the ambition and avarice of Tarquin be then only cow∣ards when they are to deliver themselves from sla∣very Some of you perhaps are intimidated by the army which Tarquin now commands The soldiers you imagine will take the part of their general Banish so groundless a fear The love of liberty is natural to all men Your fellow citizens in the camp feel the weight of oppression with as quick a sense as you that are in Rome They will as eagerly seize the occasion of throwing of the yoke But let us grant there may be some among them who through baseness of spirit or a bad education will be dis∣posed to favour the tyrant The number of these can be but small and we have means sufficient in our hands to reduce them to reason They left us hos∣tages more dear to them than life Their wives their children their fathers their mothers are in the city Courage Romans the gods are for us those Gods whose temples and altars the impious Tarquin has profaned by sacrifices and libations made with pol∣luted hands polluted with blood and with num∣berless unexpiated crimes committed against his sub∣jects Ye Gods who protected our forefathers ye Genii who watch for the preservation and glory of Rome do you inspire us with courage and unani∣mity  in this glorious cause and we will to our last breath defend your worship from all profanation"  To be continued in following Numbers  Eccl iv  So I returned and considered all the Oppressions that are done under the Sun and behold the  TEARS  of such as were  OPPRESSED  and they had  NO COMFORTER  and on the side of their Oppressors there was  POWER  but they had no Comforter Where∣fore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive Yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the  EVIL WORK  that is done under the Sun  THE following extract from a very interesting work lately published intitled  "Travels in the Western Hebrides by the Rev John Lane Buchanan"  will shew some few of the hardships suffered by our brethren in one part of this  free  and  happy  nation It may be proper to premise that the Islands here spoken of are not those which lie next to the coast of Scotland but the Western  Abudae  a long chain of Islands about seventy miles farther west in the Atlantic Ocean It may be also proper to mention that altho' the author has adopted the title of  Tra∣vels  this work is the result of observation made by him during his residence in these Islands in quali∣ty of Missionary Minister from the Church of Scot∣land from to  There are in these Islands an unfortunate and numerous class of men known under the name of  Scallags  The Scallag whether male or female is a poor being who for mere subsistence becomes a predial slave to another whether a subtenant a tacksman  By Tacksmen are meant farmers to whom extensive tracts of lands are let and who let them out in small parcels to the poor people over whom they exercise the most cruel tyranny and op∣pression As sew of the proprietors resides themselves on the islands these  acks  en who are generally relations of the LAIRDS may  e considered the highest class of the people    or a laird The Scallag builds his own hut with sods and boughs of trees and if he is sent from one part of the country to another he moves off his sticks and by means of these forms a new hut in another place He is however in most places en∣couraged by the possession of the walls of a former but which he covers in the best way be can with his old sticks stubble and fern Five days in the week he works for his master the sixth is allowed to himself for the cultivation of some scrap of land on the edge of some moss or moor on which he raises a little kail or colewort barley and potatoes These articles boiled up in one mash and often without salt are his only food except in those sea∣sons and days when he can catch some fish which he is also obliged not unfrequently to eat without bread or salt The only bread he tastes is a cake made of the flower of barley He is allowed coarse shoes with tartan hose and a coarse coat with a blanket or two for cloathing It may occur to an English reader that as the Scallag works only five days out of seven for his master he has two to pro∣vide for himself But it is to be recollected that throughout the whole of Scotland and all its ap∣pendages Sunday or the sabbath as it is called is celebrated by a total cessation from all labour and all amusements as well as by religious exercises  The tacksmen and subtenants formerly on an equal footing or nearly so were wont to plead their cause on equal terms before a common chief At present they are obliged to be much more sub∣missive to their tacksman than ever they were in former times to their lairds or lords Formerly they were a free animated and bold people command∣ing respect for their undanted courage and repell∣ing injuries from whatever quarter they came both by words and actions But now they must ap∣proach even the tacksmen with cringing humility heartless and discouraged with tattered rags hun∣gry  bellies and downcast looks carrying their own implements of husban try for ten or twelve miles backward and forward over hills and mountains to do the work of the tacksmen and must either sit we  in their cloaths all night in a dirty kitchen or sleep in dirty cloaths particularly in Luskintire in Harris exposed to be trampled on by swine where the kitchen is commonly the stye Formerly a Highlander would have drawn his dirk against even a laird if he had subjected him to the indig∣nity of a blow at present any tyrannical tacksman may strike a Scallag or even a subtenant with per∣fect impunity What degree of spirit and virtue is to be expected from a people so humbled so en∣staved What degree of courage or even inclinati∣tion to repel an invading enemy  If we have not money  some of these tacksmen have been known to say  we have men enough let us wear them well while they are in our power  In short they treat them like beasts of burthen and in all respects like slaves attached to the soil as they cannot ob∣tain new habitations on account of combinations among the tacksmen and are entirely at the mercy of the laird or tacksman  The master or his overseer often on the most frivolous pretences abandons himself to bursts of passion and with hands feet and rods breaks the bones of men and women too This is not an ex∣aggerated picture The broken ribs of one young maid named Macklellan from the village of Cluar attest the fact which was committed by a tacksman assuming the title of DOCTOR This same  doctor  almost took the life of another innocent maid from Shilebost though she gave no other offence than that of tarrying a little longer than he wished at her mistresses desire to finish something she had in hand  Better to trust a whole People with the power of

INVULNERABLE FROM HARRINCTON'S OCEANA  ALL government as implied by what has been already shewn is of these three kinds  A go∣vernment of servants A government of subjects or A government of citizens  The first is absolute monar∣chy as that of  Turkey  The second aristocratical monarchy as that of  France  The third a common∣wealth as those of  Israel  of  Rome  of  Holland  Now to follow MACHIAVEL in part of these the government of servants is the harder to be con∣quered and the easier to be held The government of subjects is the easter to be conquered and the harder to be held To which I shall presume to add that the government of citizens is both the hardest to be conquered and the hardest to be held  My author's reasons why a government of ser∣vants is the hardest to be conquered come to this that they are under perpetual discipline and com∣mand void of such interests and factions as have hands or power to hold upon advantages or innova∣tion whence he that invades the  Turk  must trust to his own strength and not rely upon disorders in the government or forces which he shall be sure enough to find united  His reasons why this government being once broken is easily held are that the armies once past hope of rallying there being no such thing as families hanging together or nobility to stir up their dependants to further reluctancy for the present or to preserve themselves by complacence with the conquerors for future discontents or advantages  he that has won the garland has no more to do but to extinguish the royal line and wear it ever after in security For the people having been always slaves are such whose condition he may better in which case they are gainers by their conqueror but can never make a worse and therefore they lose nothing by him Hence ALEXANDER having con∣quered the  Persian  empire he and his captains af∣ter him could hold it without the least dispute except it arose among themselves Hence MAHO∣MET the second having taken  Constantinople  and put  Palaeologus  the  Greek  emperor whose govern∣ment was of like nature with the  Persian  together with his whole family to the sword the  Turk  has held that empire without reluctancy  On the other side the reasons why a government of subjects is easier conquered are these That it is supported by a nobility so antient so powerful and of such hold and influence upon the people that the king without danger if not ruin to him∣self or the throne an example whereof was given in HENRY the seventh of  England  can neither in∣vade their privileges nor level their estates which remaining they have power upon every discontent to call in an enemy as ROBERT Count of  Artois  did the  English  and the Duke of  Guise  the  Spaniard  into  France  The reasons why a government of subjects being so easily conquered is nevertheless harder to be held are these that the nobility being soon out of countenance in such a case and repenting them∣selves of such a bargain have the same means in their hands whereby they brought in the enemy to drive him out as those of  France  did both the  English  and the  Spaniards  For the government of citizens as it is of two kinds an equal or an unequal commonwealth the reason why it is the hardest to be conquered are also of two kinds as first the reasons why a go∣vernment  of citizens where the commonwealth is equal is hardest to be conquered are that the invader of such a society must not only trust to his own strength insomuch as the commonwealth being equal he must needs find them united but in re∣gard that such citizens being all soldiers or trained up to their arms which they use  not  for the defence of  slavery  but of LIBERTY A CONDITION NOT IN THIS WORLD TO BE BETTERED they have more especially upon this occasion the highest soul of courage and if their territory be of any extent the vastest body of a well disciplined militia that is possible in nature wherefore AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A ONE OVERCOME BY THE ARMS OF A MO∣NARCH IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE WORLD And if some small city of this frame has happened to be vanquished by a potent commonwealth  this is her prerogative her towers are her funeral pile and she expires in her own flame leaving nothing to the con∣queror but her ashes as  Saguntum  overwhelmed by  Carthage  and  Numantia  by  Rome  A DESCRIPTION OF PRINCE LUCIFER's SUBJECTS From a Pamphlet entitled The Rights of the Devil  ALL those men whatever description or what∣ever country they may belong to in whom the Devil  as right and property and over whom he extends his influence are like wolves easily dis∣tinguished from the sheep to which he lays claim because there is a particular mark whereby you may know those ravenous beasts Moreover you will always see them exceedingly active in their monarch Lucifer's service they are invested with full power to oppress and torture human nature for the sake of plundering them Their iron hearts  are dead to the feelings of humanity they regard not the cries of the fatherless neither does the cause of the widow come near them Cast an eye to the cruelties daily committed in the sl  ve trade reflect for a moment on the many thousands of wretched Africans who are tortared out of existence year∣ly in order to exact from their labour to which in justice they have not the least claim Some in the various modes of obtaining them others suf∣focated in the floating bastiles by the stench and corrupted air which they breathe in the hold while being conveyed to the land of slavery and death in the West Indies and those who survive the shocking treatment they experience while on board or are not swept away by disease have only a worse fate awaiting them worked without intermission and flogged without commiseration they are hurried to their eternal home by those savage monsters who have the charge of them Thus are these innocent beings murdered by the agents and servants of the devil whom they adore and serve and whose right and property they are  Is not the influence of Satan very visible in some other illustrious characters the avowed enemies of the human race who claim and lay hold upon the tenth of the product of the earth which have been increased by improvement and produced by the sweating brows of other men Can there be any justice in such plundering as this or rather is not that man a better character who only stops you in the highway once in your life and exacts from you your purse You will certainly answer these questions in the affirmitive and declare that we are completely humbugged by the priesthood Hence arises the necessity of priestcraft to blind the eyes of the people and render them totally ignorant and unaquainted in this important fact that a priesthood is and always has been a curse  to all nations of the earth Ignorance in the mul∣titude is the chief support and only nutriment by which the v  mity and pride of the clergy is fed As tythe pigs fill their filthy sties and black waistcoasts of corruption Ah deluded swinish mul∣titude typified by the tythe pig highly emblema∣tical of your wallowing in the mire of church and state while the idle and dissipated beings who op∣press you are rolling in luxury and debauchery at the expence of your delusion How long you will you not call to Belzebub to remove from you your tormentors and take them as his right to his eternal kingdom  There is another class of men in whom Luci∣fer has great right and are thus described by Lord Chatham "There is" says he  a set of men in London who are

protection of the legislature To me my lords whether they be miserable jobbers of Changealley or the lofty Asiatic plunderers of Leadenhall street they are all equally detestable I care but little whether a man walks on foot or is drawn by six or eight horses if his luxury be supported by the plun∣der of his country I despise and abhor him My lords while I had the honour of serving his majesty I never ventured to look at the  Treasu∣ry  but from a distance it is a business I am unfit for and to which I never could have submitted The little I know of it has not served to raise my opinion of what is vulgarly called the mo∣nied interest I mean that  bloodsucker  that  muck∣worm  which calls itself the friend of govern∣ment which pretends to serve this or that ad∣ministration and may be purchased on the same terms by any administration Under this de∣scription  I include the whole race of commission∣ers jobbers contractors clothiers and remit∣ters  To these may be added all placemen

and influence would re∣quire an age Yet you may observe that I have pointed out to you some of the most conspicuous persons who are the destined inhabitants of Luci∣fer's kingdom from the regal

of kings Most willingly replied Candide and drank Now you are a brave fellow said they you are become his support his defender one of the heroes of Bulgaria your fortune is made your fameeternal They then put handcuffs on his wrists conducted him to the regiment There they made him turn to the right wheel to the left shoulder his musket rest upon his arms present fire march and countermarch in return for which the drill serjeant gave him some thirty strokes with the cane The next day he performed his exer∣cise better and received only twenty On the morrow they gave him but ten and all his com∣rades regarded him as a prodigy of genius  The astonished Candide could not conceive by what enchantment he had become a hero One pleasant morning in spring when the birds were singing and the trees beginning to bloom he thought proper to take a walk Proceeding in a right line and supposing it was the privilege of the human species like other animals to make use of their legs he had not gone above two leagues before six other heroes each of six feet high overtook him bound him and threw him into a dungeon He was juridically asked whe∣ther he preferred being thirtysix times flogged through the regiment or to suffer twelve balls to pass through his brains In vain did he assert the freedom of the will and affirm that he pre∣ferred neither the one nor the other chuse he  must and in virtue of that gift of God which is called Liberty he concluded in favour of flogging He was twice brought to the halbards where he each time received five hundred lashes which slay∣ed him from the hips to the nape of the neck and laid the muscles and nerves all bare As they were proceeding to the third course CANDIDE unable to endure more requested for God's sake they would have the goodness to blow out his brains His petition was favourably received but as he was kneeling blindfold the King of the Bulgarians happened to come to the parade and enquired concerning his crime As this king was a man of great genius he comprehended from the story they told him that CANDIDE was a young metaphysi∣cian ignorant of the world and he granted his pardon which clemency has been and will be re∣corded in every newspaper every history and eve∣ry age A skilful surgeon iu three weeks cured CANDIDE by use of the emollients which DIO∣SCO  IDES prescribes The skin again began to cover his back and he was able to march when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the Abarians  Nothing could be so charming so dazzling so well disciplined so well appointed as the two ar∣mies The trumpets drums hautboys fifes and cannon formed a concert of such harmony as Hell itself never equalled To begin the artillery laid low about six thousand men on each side The musquetry next dispatched between nine and ten thousand knaves who infested the surface of this best of possible worlds and the bavonet in its turn was the adequate cause of the death of as many more The whole amount was at least thirty thou∣sand souls CANDIDE who trembled like a philo∣sopher hid himself as well as he could during this heroic butchery At length while the two kings ordered  Te deum  to be sung in their two camps he  thought proper to depart and reason elsewhere on causes and effects He passed over mountains of the dying and the dead The first village he came to belonged to the Aba  ians it was reeking with smoke having been burnt by the Bulgarians ac∣cording to the laws of nations Here stood old men maimed by the enemy gazing on their mur∣dered  ives with their dead children extended on their bleeding bosoms There lay virgins with their wombs ripped open after having appeased the natural appetites of certain heroes giving up the ghost Others half ro  ed called aloud for one to come and dispatch them entirely Here the brains of men were scattered here their arms here their legs and here their mangled trunks CANDIDE fled with all his might to another village that be∣lo  ed to the Bulgarians which the heroes of Aba∣ria had treated in much the same manner At length marching over limbs still trembling hearts still p  lpitating and fires yet unextinguished he luckily escaped from the theatre of war and glory  From the Candid Philosopher printed in the year  ON THE PROCRESS OF LIBETRY IN FRANCE  HOWEVER the present age may have receded from genuine piety it has certainly m  de the most rapid advances in a freedom and liberality of sentiment which do honour to human nature The French nation has particularly distinguished itself in this respect Its writers display a vigour of thought they have till now been almost strangers to They plead the cause of human nature and assert man's natural  ights with an energy and warmth that seem to indicate the speedy downfal of that vast fabric of superstition and error that has hitherto so greatly obstructed the progress of free  enquiry and chilled even the emotions of huma∣nity What writer of any nation can express him∣self with greater zeal for the sovereignty of the laws against the blind will of the monarch the ty∣ranny of ministers or the clamour of a mob than to lay this down as a just maxim "Le glaire re∣doubtable de la justice n'a point ete deposed  ns les mains des magistrats pour venger des haines parti∣  ul  eres ni meme pour suivre les monvemens de I indignation publique  e  t a LA LOI SEULE appartient de marquer les victimes et si les cla∣meurs d'une multitude aveugle et passionn  e pou∣voint decider les juges a prononcer one Peine ca∣pitale I innocence pren  oit la place du crime et il n'y auroit plus de surete pour le citoyen" These are just and excellent sentiments but they are not peculiar to this writer The greater part of his coun∣trymen now think with the same freedom and speak with the same force This liberal spirit has a great∣er tendency to exalt the French nation than all the military operations of their much boasted Lewis XIV whose glories sunk and whose victories im∣poverished the kingdom he sought to strengthen and enrich However as Englishmen we may la∣ment the dawing splendor of the French monarchy enlighte'ed by the Sun of science yet as citizens of the universe we must rejoice at the great and glorious effects produced by the genius of liberty that can turn Siberia's deserts into Albion's fertile plains unlock the sources of plenty and bliss and change brutes and slaves into men and heroes  ON A LIFE OF LABOUR  FROM THE SAME  WE read in many authors great encomiums on a life of  labour  and of the superior blessings of peasants and hard working men whose tempe∣rate  and abstemious lives not only make them enjoy an uninterrupted state of health but throw a crim∣son on their cheeks and give a vigour to their bo∣dies the sons of wealth and affluence they tell us may in vain sigh for This sounds well but I own I am doubtful of the fact  If I compare the working part of mankind who  e hard and work hard with those who eat and drink of the good "things of the earth" I think I can discern better complexions choicer animal sp  ri  s and stronger bodies in the latter than in the former Incessant labour and coarse and scanty food have certainly a tendency to weaken the bo∣dies of mankind and wear them out before their time  And this we  is the ease What becomes t  n of the fine spun theories of visionary authors who so greatly extol a laborious lifeWhy they are destroyed like other cobweb systems that will not bear  handling  The personal Virtues of a Monarch are unable to secure him from contempt if he will be led blindfold by wicked Ministers  FROM THE SAME  A MONARCH who will suffer himself to be directed by vicious favourites and ministers though virtuous in himself is in fact the author of their vices and all the unhappy consequences that result from them A monarch who is the fa∣ther of his people should not be the dupe of a fa∣vourite A monarch who should see and judge for himself should not take things upon trust If a nation from the height of splendour and glory should be brought by the ignorance or treachery of incapable or wicked ministers to a state of misery and contempt despised abroad and at home unhap∣pyit is but poor consolation to reflect that the  king has many personal virtues Was this imagi∣nary description to become a real picture of a nati∣on and its virtuous monarch I would cry out wiih Marcus in the Tragedy of Cato  "Curse on his virtuesthey've undone his country"  MODERN MOTIVES FOR WAR  From Barlow's advice to the Privileged Orders  ONE general character will apply to much the greater part of the wars of modern times they are  political  and not vindictive This alone is sufficient to account for their real origin They are wars of agreement rather than of dissention and the conquest is taxes and not territory To carry on this business it is necessary not only to keep up the military spirit of the noblesse by titles and pensions and to keep in pay a vast number of troops who know no other God but their king who lose all ideas of themselves in contemplating their officers and who forget the duties of a m  n to practise those of a soldierthis is but half the operation an essential part of the military system is to disarm the people to hold all the functions of war as well the arm that executes as the will that declares it equally above their reach This part of the system has a douhle effect it palsies the hand and brutalizes the mind an habitual disuse of phy∣sical forces totally destroys the moral and men lose at once the power of protecting themselves and of discerning the cause of their oppression  ON THE GOVERNMENT OF HELL  From a Pamphlet entitled The Rights of the Devil  WE have a long time disputed and are not yet agreed in this point what is the best and most advantageous form of government for any na∣tion and for the people whereof it consists Some are for a democracy others for aristocracy and others for monarchy Although each of these opi∣nions has its favourites and is supported by very solid reasons it nevertheless appears certain that monarchy prevails over the other two because the four great empires which succeeded one another in the world and existed near two thousand years all adopted and followed a monarchial form of govern∣ment And it appears to be an indisputable fact that this is the government of the infernal empire viz an absolute monarchy It is undoubtedly the best form of government for the monarch what∣ever it may be for the subjects because the Devil assumes the power of the whole mass of beings col∣lectively and consequently can make what aggran∣dizement he pleases at the expence of his vassals and they dare not grunt their disapprobation Thus you see the Devil has a right and property in his subjects as he like earthly monarchs can rob and plunder them at his pleasure and is account∣able to no one for his deeds for it is an established maxim "That kings can do no wrong" There∣fore Lucifer as King of Hell cannot act amiss But you are ready to ask from whence did the De∣vil derive these inestimable rights and privileges Did the people his subjects give up their rights No he acquired them by assumption and by God's permission he has possessed those valuable rights through a series of ages and will continue to enjoy them for ages to come as their is no heir apparent to lucceed him Is not those  Rights of the Devil  with respect to the length of time he enjoys them  far superior to the  Rights of earthly Kings  certain∣ly they are as history furnishes us with documents to prove that he has exercised those rights through a succession of ages already near six thousand years and will undoubtedly enjoy them as many more The infernal monarchy according to history ap∣pears to have been original for I do not recollect reading of any other previous to the establishment of a monarchical government in Hell by the puis∣sant Lucifer Why thou fool say some of you how shouldst thou hear of its having a precedent since its originality is unquestionable and all other  absolute  monarchies are but eminations from that primary authority having their existence from that very source Hell is the fountain head and all terrestrial monarchies I say are but corrupted waters in comparison with the fountain which sup∣plies them notwithstanding no labour has been lost on the part of the monarchs in all ages and kingdoms to render their governments pure like their original Yet Hell is the most peaceable and justice therein the best administered of any other kingdom I have ever heard of No wars no riots no tumults or insurrections no traiterous corres∣pondence no sediton or attempt to alienate the af∣fections of Lucifer's subjects from his person no attempt to vilify and bring into contempt the con∣stitution of the empire But on the contrary the virtues most prevalent are unity peace and con∣cord throughout the whole of Lucifer's dominions In Hell the public tranquility is never disturbed in any state or apartment There you will hear of no such odious names as Paine or Priestley to alarm or terrify you by their endeavours to subvert the government or the country There will be no Birmingham Roberspieres to affright or disturb "the loyal Job Not" when he lays down his head on the lap of his mother of whom poor Job has such dreadful apprehensions  Go on thou  loyal true blue  and pursue thy jour∣ney and fear not for thou mayest assuredly depend upon a welcome reception by King Lucifer but more especially if thou art accompanied by thy con∣fort Betty Martin no questions will then be asked the mark in your foreheads will testify whose sub∣jects you are Hail happy Job and Betty Two faithful pot companions greet the brethren of the household with an unholy kiss when you enter those happy realms where loyalty and unanimity ever dwells Who can avoid contemplating the happiness of Job when undisturbed by his ene∣mies There is no such thing as a Jacobin in Hell and the names of Paine Priestley and in short all the names of modern reformers are detestable there as well as here no projects of reform are recognized there in fact thereis no necessity the constitution being in its primitive purity which is rendered mani∣fest by the desire of antirepublicans and others shew in their emigration thither What has been left undone by the celebrated Job Nott the more ef∣fectually to secure to himself a place at the helm of affairs in Satan's kingdom Has not every thing in his power been done to obtain the favour of his master Lucifer Certainly Job has been a very zealous friend in his master's service which was very conspicuous in his conduct in the Birmingham riots and he is entitled to patronage and promoti∣on in the court of Lucifer in whom the sole right of conferring places honours pensions and emo∣luments is invested Job's literary productions have also contributed very much to the population of the infernal regions which will undoubtedly pre∣judice the inhabitants greatly in his favour Me∣thinks I hear some of you say that I am jealous of the honour about to be done to Job no no far be it from me to envy any man for I declare to Job and all the world that neither envy hatred malice or uncharitableness shall ever find place within me  The Impossibility of commencing Tyrant over an armed Nation convinced of the universal Equality of Man∣kind  From Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders  ONLY admit this original un  lt  rable truth  that all men are qual in their rights  and the foundation of every thing is laid to build the su∣perstructures requires no effort but that of natural deduction The first necessary deduction will be that the people will form an equal representative government in which it will be impossible for  or∣ders  or  privileges  to exist for a moment and con∣sequently the first materials for standing armies will be converted into peaceable members of the state Another deduction follows that the people will be universally armed they will assume those wea∣pons for security which the art of war has invent∣ed for destruction You will then have removed the  necessity  of a standing army by the organization of the legislature and the  possibility  of it by the ar∣arangement of the militia for it is saimpossible for an armed soldiery to exist in an armed nation as for a nobility to exist under as equal government  It is curious to remark how ill we reason on hu∣man nature from being accustomed to view it un∣der the disguise which the unequal governments of the world have always imposed upon it During the American was and especially towards its close General Washington might be said to possess the hearts of all the Americans His recommendation was law and he was able to command the whole power of that people for any purpose of defence The philosophers of Europe considered this as a dangerous crisis to the cause of freedom They  knew  from the example of Caesar and Silla and Marius and Alcibiades and Pericles and Crom∣well that Washington would never lay down his arms till he had given his country a master But  after he did lay them down then came the miracle his virtue was more than human and it is by this miracle of virtue in him that the Americans are supposed to enjoy their liberty at this day  I believe the virtue of that great man to be equal to the highest human virtue that has ever yet been known but to an American eye no extraordinary portion of it could appear in that transaction It would have been impossible for the General or the anny to have continued in the field after the ene∣my left it for the soldiers were all  citizens  and if it had been otherwise their numbers were not the hundreth part of the citizens at large who were all  soldiers  To say that he was wise in dis∣cerning the impossibility of success in an attempt to imitate the great heroes abovementioned is to give him only the same merit for sagacity which is common to every other person who knows the country or has well considered the effects of equal liberty  ON THE POMPOUS TITLES GIVEN TO THE DIGNIFIED CLERGY  From the Candid Philosopher  THE pompous titles given to the haughty suc∣cessors of humble fishermen have often ama∣zed me Some of them appear to me either to bor∣der on the very confines of blasphemy or to have no meaning in them I would fain know how any man alive can with propriety be called a RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD What is the mean∣ing of this great title How can any man formed of dust and ashes full of frailty and full of sin be said to be RIGHT REVEREND And how is he a  Father  in GOD Equivocation may explain away these words but common sense must determine they are impious and absurdAs to the terms your  Grace  your Lordship your  Reverence  c c they favour too much of vanity and laical pride to be∣come the humility of the disciples of CHRIST and teachers of his gospel I cannot find any such titles were ever given to our SAVIOUR or his apostles yet without intending any affront to the pious Pastors of the established Church I really think the apostles were as holy wise and virtuous as any of the Primates Archbishops Prebendaties Rectors Vicars c c c c c of the pre∣sent age  ON THE VENALITY OF VOTERS BOTH IN AND OUT OF PARLIAMENT  From the Adventures of Gabriel Outcast  THOUGH our prudent ancestors found it ne∣cessary to curb the influence of the crown by enacting a law that none of its officers should interfere in elections yet matters are come to such a pass that administration found it necessary to have as many voices in the house as they could acquire for this purpose no money was spared and every measure pursued that would defe  t and evade the standing laws against bribery and corrup∣tion The misfortune seemed to be this in the reign of King William venality in parliament was unknown every man voted as his judgment and conscience directed him and the minister could carry no measures of his own unless they tended to the general good  This did not agree with King William who was an arbitrary prince and of course found his situa∣tion so uneasy that he was once on the eve of re∣turning to Holland in disgust and would undoubt∣edly have done it had not his ministers contrived to carry his favourite points by bribing the Parlia∣ment of those times Thus did that venality to  which the enormous debt of this nation is in a great measure owing descend from the crown to the people for in those days it was found difficult to find representatives and the electors were obliged to court gentlemen to serve them But when the members found they were to be rewarded for their votes men were so eager to get into parliament that they courted the electors who in their turn expected o  be paid for their suffrages of course the members of the lower house in a few years could not obtain a sear but at a great expence and to reimburse themselves made terms with the mi∣nister and such was the degeneracy of the times that men would not vete even according to their consciences without a bribe This corruption spreading from the lower house to the upper has occasioned all the cala  ties under which this coun∣try labours and whereas venality near a century ago descended as I observed from the crown to the people it now rises from the people to the crowm  Note  At the end of the  Second Part  will be given a  Table of Contents  to the Volume  The remaining Part of the Work will be published as the former neemely in Weekly Penny Numbers  END OF THE FIRST PART  PART SECOND OF  PIGS' MEAT  OR Lessons for the Swinish Multitude PUBLISHED IN WEEKLY PENNY NUMBERS  Defects in the English Constitution as to Representation From the  Complaints of the Poor People of Eng∣land  By  G Dyer B A  IN England few poor men have any share in making the laws Some may probably think and certain politicians assert that poor men have neither the power nor the right to make laws What is this but to assert that the poor man's portion in England is s  wery I do not say that the poor people of Eng∣land are slaves But this I say that all freemen make their own laws and I do but speak after our best po∣litical writers Will gentlemen tell me why poor men are to be slaves However while I consider every man's right to make laws as his most sacred pro∣perty and the exercise of that right as essential to li∣berty whoever cannot exercise that right be he ever so rich I must at least consider as poor in the worst sense poor My complaints therefore do not confine them∣selves  to paupers commonly so called Many poor men live in England who are possessed of thousands  There are two ways of making laws viz in our own persons or by representatives If a country be large and populous all the people cannot assemble and consult together for the purpose of making laws but if they authorize persons acquainted with their wants and interested in their happiness to represent them every good end may be answered The only danger is lest these persons should not express the public mind Never will they express it unless they represent the publicThis is the case in England the government of which it is usual to call a limited monarchy in reference to the person of the prince But in reference to the people so great a part of whom have no share in representation it might be called notwithstanding what we say of the house of commons a mixt aristocracy as Poland has been called  The king the house of peers and the house of commons compose what are called the three branches of the constitutionthe king in his own person the nobles in their own persons What is a house of com∣mons It is supposed to represent the people but some say it is a fiction that is that it does not ex∣ist but that it is only supposed to exist When men inquire into facts what are called theories frequently vanish We talk of a house of commons of a house of representatives it is the glory of Britons and foreigners laugh at us They ask us Where is this house I leave others to answer this question  If this house of commons were indeed something more than a fiction I should myself retract a little of my wonted admiration A house of commons fairly and equally representing all the people of England never did exist But if it were not a mere fiction if it were a reality I should still be obliged to yield something to the following remark viz that a house of commons supposes some superior house of nobles  or some such name But where any order of men exists of separate claims and of separate interests from the people and whose separate characters give them a kind of sacred superiority over the people liberty may perhaps be endangered It has been asserted whether justly I do not determine that such a house as that of a house of commons exists in no free state  I shall here make a sew remarks on nobility I will repeat what an ancient writer says "In no state" says he "are the nobles favourable to the peo∣ple equals are favourable to equals" And else∣where he observes in every part of the earth the go∣vernment of the nobles is inconsistent with that of the people and he gives his reasons for the oppsi∣tion of the two orders A French writer perhaps had his eye on these passages when he said the Eng∣lish nobility baried themselves with Charles I under the ruins of the throne He adds "they think it an honour to obey a king but consider it as the lowest infamy to snare the power with the people  It might be easily shewn that a patent nobility made no part of the old English government or of the other governments of Europe Xenophon and Montesquieu were friends the one to aristocracy the other to monarchy yet nobody ever more exposed them It is of a government where an hereditary patent nobility is said to balance the two extremes of monarchy and democracy that Blackstone observes "It creates and preserves that gradual scale of dig∣nity which proceeds from the beggar to the prince rising like a pyramid from a broad foundation and diminishing to a point as it rises It is this ascend∣ing and contracting proportion that adds stability to any government for when the departure is sudden from one extreme to another we may pronounce that state to be precarious" This is beautiful flattering also to national vanity but it is theoretical The ascending and contracting proportion is seen among most of the American states in a house of representa∣tives  chosen by the people in a senate appointed by the representatives and in a president or governor appointed mediately or immediately by the people yet the Americans have no nobles The system of aristocracy they think tends to weakness It dis∣solves they say the ties of families by the law of pri∣mogeniture exhausts the public money in places for the younger branches of noble families keeps the orders of society in a kind of dwarsish state by per∣petuating the maxims of a barbarous age weakens the legislature by advancing men to legislation whose private regards absorb public spirit and who are ir∣responsible to the nation and by dividing man from man enfeebles the order of human beings Who can tell where the tide of contingencies will flow France in whose political fabric nobility did indeed seem to form the great Corinthian capital saw it necessary to remove it to raise a government of justice  "I have also admitted that an order of nobles might exist without a patent nobility I have not said that it is necessary or if necessary that an hereditary nobility is Its great use may be thought to consist in forming a kind of senate to give bias and consistency to other powers and to produce a harmony in states a senate has even been thought essential to a republic France we have been told has left out of her political fabric the pillar of strength "Never" says a writer "before this time was heard of a body politic without such a council" yet Geneva in the infancy of the republic was such a more scientific writer than Mr Burke though he elsewhere says that a king and peo∣ple may exist without a senate yet does in fact say "there never was a good government in the world that did not consist of the three simple species of monarchy aristocracy and democracy"  "Yet France has thought otherwise She thinks that by breaking the distinctions between man and man she strengthens society and makes the public force permanent by uniting it in a national assembly  I decide nothing on the truth of these sentiments I propose these questionsWas it not the existence of the two orders of patricians and plebeians that pro∣moted all the disorders of the Roman government Were not the senatus consulta and the plebiscita fre∣quently little else than exclusive decrees for particular interests And while the patricians were encroach∣ing on the plebeians the tribunes called to the aid of the plebeians became in their turn factious dema∣gogues Amid private regards was not public li∣berty unknown Was it not a senate that destroyed the liberties of Geneva"  But to return to the House of commons Whom or what does a house of commons representnot al∣ways rational beings men and women but for the greater part property and property of a particular kind Property though ever so large copyhold leasehold or personal cannot be represented but free∣hold estates only possessed by men Females though possessed of l a year either in land or money have no representatives Since the reign of Henry VI none can be electors of knights of the shire but men possessed of forty shillings a year But how few poor men have freeholds Some parishes consisting of several hundred persons perhaps have not a single freeholder Some of the largest and most wealthy towns in England have not a single representative I have not yet spoken of boroughs But our theory be∣gins to vanish  If the reader can avoid smiling at the following facts I shall think him fimple if he feel no indig∣nation I shall think him something worse  The borough of Midhurst in Sussex it is well known contains not a single house and yet sends two members to Parliament The right of election is in one hundred and twenty burgageholds the former situation of which is marked out by a stone on each sideThe borough of Old Sarum in Wiltshire sends two members to parliament yet there is but one or  two houses standing The members are chosen by a bailiff and six burgesses appointed by Lord Camel∣ford  the lord of the borough  and entrusted by him with burgagescites The borough of Gatton and CastleRising have each two houses only and two re∣presentatives each  The tenures of Midhurst I would observe make no part of the town of Midhurst They were the property of the late Lord Montague who at the time of the election made a temporary assignment of a part of them either to some of his domestics or friends in order to have those members returned that he should nominate The trustees of the estates of the present lord sold these burgageholds to the earl of Egremont for guineas whose brothers were returned for this borough the last general election  Hastings in Sussex before the  assing of Mr Crewe's bill was entirely at the disposal of the trea∣sury The number of voters was  out twenty all of whom had places under government or were pro∣vided for some other way This is the borough I think in the management of which a Mr Collins ac∣quired a most splendid fortune and made ample pro∣vision for five coheiresses his daughters The bo∣rough of Hastings I think is still in the  management  of government These are what are called rotten bo∣roughs  I have already hinted that some large towns and these abounding with manufactories have not a single representative and even where property is represented it is not represented equally The county of Mid∣dlesex in paid parts of the land tax and in of the subsidy and sent only eight mem∣bers to parliament while Cornwall paid but eight parts of the land tax and five only of the subsidy and yet sent fortyfour As to the rotten boroughs of some of which I have just spoken they represent nobody they are private property The persons who are chosen for them represent nobody yet they have  all the power of representatives a use also they cer∣tainly have they strengthen the influence of the crown and if a man have money enough to purchase a borough and meanness enough to obey the beck of the minister we know the restThus it is that per∣sons who were never appointed by the people make laws  The house of representatives amounts to between five and six hundred members the majority of which are appointed by voters not exceeding twelve thou∣sand the nation consists of seven or eight million so that the persons who do actually give a vote for mem∣bers are comparatively a small part of the community The Duke of Richmond whose statement I here nearly follow once understood political calculation and I am persuaded it is only what is supposed to be the danger of the experiment that makes him fearful of the rule of practice Mr Paine observes that not above one in seven is represented this relates to repre∣sentatives actually chosen for when all the circum∣stances taken into the account are considered one writer asserts that the walls of St Stephen's Chapel have not been visited by six members in any par∣liament elected appointed or delegated by their con∣stituents and another that not one person in five housand is represented But leaving these writers I ask again Where is our house of commons Some call it a stubborn aristocracy Where is our house of representativesSome call it a fiction Our the∣ory they say is gone Be this as it may the poor man is left to pay taxes  AN APOLOGY FOR YOUNGER BROTHERS  By the Author of  A Plea for a Common Wealth  Printed in the Year    IT hath been a long received custom in this land or at least of as ancient date as the Norman monar∣chy that notwithstanding the elder son obtains the whole inheritance yet to bestow a generous and li∣beral education on the younger in which consider∣ing the circumstances of those times together with the complexion of their government I find no cause wherefore to accuse our ancestors of either impru∣dence or injustice  For first the levelling of estates hath always and that justly enough been accounted altogether un∣suitable to the majesty and gaudy splendor of monar∣chi  l government which hath sometimes though fals  ly been supposed not only the most absolute and perfect form but that which by long experience hath been found most suitable to the genius or humour of the English people the interest of which government is rather to have large public revenues with a vast stock of preferments wherewith to gratify the am∣bition of the more ingenious part of the gentry who have nothing to rely on save what they can purchase in the favour of their prince Nor was antiquity herein deceived for when the greatest part of the nation by this means reap their chief subsistence from the public revenues of the Commonwealth and favour of the prince in whose sole dispose they are and on whom for this cause they look upon as their common father and indeed to whom they have greater obli∣gations than to their own parents there appears lit∣tle probability how the pillars of such a government should be easily shaken whose basis is founded on the interest of so great a part of the nation to defend it with the utmost peril of their lives and blood Nor have we more reason to accuse our ancestors of im∣piety  or injustice than imprudence since heretofore so great and ample were the public revenues that a younger son could either in church or state by the wings of his own industry or merits have raised him∣self to as high a pitch of honour and fairer fortunes than those of his elder brother's birthright so that to be the firstborn was scarce a privilege except to such as wanted worth to advance them wherefore while the Church and Court were open with their large train of preferments to entertain the more in∣genious of the gentry's younger sons and monasteries to entomb those of a less mercurial genius there was little reason for commencing this complaint for this I am compelled by the violence of truth to confess in defence of the ancient constitution of the laws and government of this nation that whatever their other faults they were not injurious to younger brethren till after the sale of churchlands and the abrogating those many preferments that were their former inhe∣ritance  This was the former state of the nation in which if younger sons were debarred a share in their fathers inheritance they might receive an ample compensa∣tion from the Church their mother whose jointure was no less than two thirds of the whole land so that they might seem rather owned as the only children of the Commonwealth and honourably maintained at the public charge thereof than disinherited by the unkindness of the laws A generous education was then a sufficient portion which is now for want of a suitable employment become a curse instead of a blessing serving to no other end than to discover if not augment their misery so much is the scene of things changed since Henry VIII spoiled the church of her revenues and by consequence these of the fairest part of their inheritance and yet nothing of the rigour of the ancient laws are herein abated to∣wards them It is not my intention God knows my heart to speak a word in approbation of those super∣stitious  uses to which any abbey or bishops lands were heretofore employed but with reflection on those good and pious to which in the opinion of some they might have been converted  Nor is it the design of these discourses to retrieve ecclesiastical promotions or demonstrate a necessity of rebuilding the things we have so lately destroyed but rather to shew how unsafe and injurious it would be to establish and fix a Commonwealth upon the ruins and tottering foundation of a decayed monarchy nor do I blame the prudence of our late reformers that unhorseing the pride of the clergy and putting down the hierarchy they rather sold than reserved in a public stock the revenues of the church by reason it may seem more safe for a Commonwealth to keep nothing that may encourage an invasion of its liberty or become the reward of usurpation and tyranny only I could wish that since the reason and circum∣stances of our laws are quite altered we might not still build on old foundations and entail the whole land on a few proprietors or elder brethren to the exclusion and utter ruin of the greatest part of the nation and contrary to the interest of a free state or Commonwealth I dare not charge all our late changes and many turnings in the balance of affairs on this account though I cannot but observe that our times have rung more changes been tuned to more different instruments and ran through more se∣veral forms of government than were from the times of the Norman Conquest known before to which how much the discontent and poverty of our gentry may have contributed I know not but Solomon saith  Oppression will make a wise man mad  I am sure the Younger Brothers are by far the greater number and through nature's courtesy commonly as rich in intellectual endowments as poor in fortunes and be∣ing by the tyranny as affairs now stand of Law and Custom debarred sharing in their parents estates to which they conceive nature equally entitles them with  their Elder Brethren  it is no wonder if they desire to interrupt the peace and tranquillity of the Commonwealth  since by the shakings thereof they may probably root themselves in fairer fortunes than from its peace and settlement they may with reason expect and that which arms their discontent with fit weapons for re∣venge and renders them more formidable is their generous education for certainly it is of very un∣safe and dangerous consequence to qualify such for great and noble undertakings that are heirs to no other fortunes than what their valours can purchase with the ruin of the Commonwealth's peace and go∣vernment Therefore had those that made the pub∣lic revenues a prey to their ambition also drunk up those streams of bounty by which the schools and universities are fed and maintained and so taken away the means as well as the encouragement of li∣beral education they had better consulted the peace though not the honour of the nation for so long as these are open if not better ordered I doubt there will be vipers hatched to eat through the womb of government by which they conceive themselves in∣jured and debarred both that which nature gives them title to of their parents and the ancient constitution of the Commonwealth in public revenues which I would not have understood as proceeding from any prejudice or ill will to the universities which I much honour and in which with thankfulness I acknow∣ledge to have received my education but only to discover the shortness of that policy that taking away the preferments should reward and crown all acade∣mic endeavours yet never reduced the means whereby men are qualified for an expectation and prompted to an ambition of them and indeed of a like strain is most of our modern policy not skin deep and ra∣ther to be accounted shifts and present evasions of impendent evils than antidotes of solid prudence for either the obviating or healing any disaster or ma∣lady in the body politic  Certainly a generous education is not proper for such as are intended for little less than slaves It is ignorance is the mother of obedience whereas know∣ledge makes men proud and factious especially when they conceive their fortunes and e  ployments are not correspondent to the grandeur of their birth and edu∣cation  The younger son is apt to think himself sprung from as noble a stock from the loins of as good a gentleman as his elder brother and therefore cannot but wonder why fortune and the law should make so great a difference between them that lay in the same womb that are formed of the same lump why law or custom should deny them an estate whom nature hath given discretion to know how to manage it  Learning ennobles and elevates the soul causing it to despise and set light by small and base things and therefore where that flourishes men are not easily taught to submit their necks to an iron yoke of slavery which prompts the Turkish prudence to ex∣tinguish all such lights by which men gain a prospect or discovery of the thraldom and misery of their condition It would drink more ink and waste more time than I or perhaps the reader would willingly bestow to give an account of all the mischiefs and inconveniences that proceed from the fertile womb of this single mistake that a generous education not∣withstanding the abolition of all encouragements of learning and ingenious preferments is a sufficient por∣tion for a Younger Brother Wisdom is good with an inheritance but the wisdom of the poor man is despised The muses without a dowry are but des∣picable virgins and the unnatural though usual di∣vorce that is at this day found between wit and mo∣ney renders both useless if not pernicious to the Commonwealth I doubt not but should we take a view of things through the prospective of some men's observations we should discover this in part the cause of that tranquillity and settlement peace and  prosperity with which in former times this British Isle was crowned as also of those many shakings and convulsions in which these latter ages have seen her cast into and can we expect it should be otherwise when as Solomon hath observed  There is not bread to the wise nor riches to men of understanding nor yet fa∣vour to men of skill c  which seems to proceed from no other cause than the iniquity of our laws pouring all the wealth into one channel and conveying the whole land into the hands of a few Proprietors or elder Brethren  I confess those providence hath placed on high on the battlements of supreme power may if their eyes are open and not blinded by private interest com∣mand a fairer prospect and discern farther into these things then such whom a meaner fortune hath left in the valley of a low and private condition therefore I shall not presume to inform those intelligences that turn about the orbs of government only could wish there were such a scene of things brought forth as may give encouragement to expect a settlement with∣out a miracle  To which as things now stand I cannot persuade myself but that the establishing of gavel kind would have no small tendency for can any thing be done more suitable to a Commonwealth or is there any thing more just and equitable than that all the chil∣dren should share in their Parents inheritances or in∣deed is there not rather an absolute necessity thereof since all the former avenues by which men had ac∣cess to preferment are hedged up is not the only door at present open to a fortune that of the law which is also now together with all other professions so overstocked with students and thereby become so burdensome that the Nation will no longer endure it For are they not necessitated to devise daily new quirks and subtleties whereby suits may be multi∣plied to the confusion of estates and oppression of the people How much more honourable would it be  to our reformation and new established government that there were a more equal and righteous distri∣bution of the things of this earth than that the greater part of the nation should be put to shift and scramble for a livelihood or be necessitated to live on the sins of the people  Why estates may not for the future descend regu∣larly to the whole offspring that are of the same blood and family instead of one branch thereof I know no inconvenience in that especially in those circumstances we are in at present being fallen into an age so eagleeyed and quicksighted as to discern spots on the sun and discover corruption in the hea∣vens which the duller opticks of antiquity judged im∣maculate and as altogether incorruptible an age that dares pry into the pious frauds and unmask the most religious deceits which the devouter ignorance of our ancestors never beheld but at a superstitious and reverential distance an age in which the art of living or to gain and honest subsistance is grown so subtle so difficult and abstruse a mystery that few are able to master it  How many ingenious gentlemen that are now clothed with rags and misery might have raised them∣selves to fair estates had they had a stock wherewith to set their industry on work for can any man make brick wherewith to build themselves a fortune with∣out any straw How many might this have reprieved from an untimely death who might have been useful to their country and ornaments to the Common∣wealth had their parts and ingenuities found due en∣couragements How many brave sparkling wits that might have proved bright stars and shining lamps both in Church and Commonwealth have been ex∣tinguished in obscurity for want of maintenance the oil whereby their lamps should have been fed and nourished  Were it not far more just to restrain marriage or at least give check and set bounds to the lust of parents  by stinting the number of their offspring to a child or two and sealing up the fertile womb than thus turn that blessing of god  increase and multiply  into the greatest curse  and visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children  Or were it not a greater act of charity according to the example of the Heathen to expose or drown these latter births as we do such supernume∣rary dogs c as would otherwise overstock our com∣mons than thus expose them like so many little  s  ses in arks of bulrushes to a sea of poverty and  sery from whence they many never expect reprieve unless some miraculous providence like Pharo's  ghters chance to rescue and receive them into her court and favour Our law making no more pro∣vision for Younger Brethren than if they were to be cloathed like the lillies of the field or like Elias to expect their food from ravens receiving no other comfort from the hands of men than what they can suck from the dry breasts of an old proverb that God will send meat wheresoever he hath provided mouths than which nothing more true did not the covetous∣ness of men withhold it  It was the custom of our gentry and nobility to clap such of their phlegmatic offspring as nature had not made mercurial enough to ambiate either church or court preferments into some religious habit and so keep up the splendour of their families by prun∣ing away such underbranches for the service of the alter as either through their number or folly were like to let in poverty and thereby become a dispa∣r  gement to the noble stock from whence they sprang which hath prompted some to an opinion that if in these more populous northern climates a kind of Pro∣testant monasteries were erected for encouragement of chastity and single life especially among the poorer sort it would pardoning the solecism of the name be more consonant to the maxims of state and true po∣lley than in those hotter and more barren climates where there is so little danger of being overstocked  or burdened with people that on the contrary they want men for the necessary defence of their territories of which we have a pertinent instance in Spain whose religious houses did not their blind devotion so much triumph over their policy had long since been buried under their own ruins for there can no other account be given why that wise and prudent nation labouring under so great a weight of affairs and scarcity of men to manage their wars should tolerate so many hives of drones which so long as they shall continue may give good caution and security to its neighbouring states and princes to lay asleep their fears and jea∣lousies of his ever attaining that universal monarchy at which for so many centuries the lips of his proud ambition have been thought to water there being little probability that his palsey hands should grasp the universe that hath not strength enough to hold that little part thereof he hath already fastened on and therefore the Spanish conquests may not unfitly be compared to those of rivers upon the banks of their channels losing as much in one place as they gain in others  But since Providence hath been pleased in mercy to bring back our captivity and again to cast us into the advantagious form of a Commonwealth if gavelkind were once established we shall stand in need of no other devices for keeping out of poverty than the setting industry on work according to the opportu∣nities plentiful occasions will administer in an equal Commonwealth But I shall now return to the lawyers from whom I have made so long a digres∣sion I have read that in the more pure and less so∣phisticated times of our ancestors great estates have been passed in few words and the conveyance proved more firm and good than those tedious prolix tau∣tological instruments the knavery of latter ages hath introduced  In sign that this is sooth  I bite the white wax with my tooth  Or the like being the form of those more simple and sincere times whereas now through the fraud of lawyers all things are so ambiguously penned that none but a sphinx in their mysteries is able to under∣stand or unriddle them  The professors of which mystery of iniquity that live upon the sins of the people are of late grown so numerous that like locusts or an Egyptian plague they cover the face of our land and are thriven to such vast estates that whereas heretofore the Church and Clergy being in possession of two thirds of the best lands throughout the realm gave birth to the sta∣tute of Mortmain for security of the rest we may justly fear unless some prudent care be taken for pre∣vention of their future purchases lest this pack c by their quirks c instate themselves in our in∣heritances and ingross the wealth and revenues of the whole nation unto themselves c  I have heard this subtle generation were not in so fair a plight when every term they beat upon the hoof to London with their satchels on their backs and at the towns end proffered their services like water∣man at the Thames side to be retained by the coun∣try clients and I know not whether we may ever ex∣pect a golden age or to see good days till the interest of this corrupt generation be laid as low as any his∣tories can produce a precedent which at this time must needs have the greatest countenance of justice that can be they having been so notoriously instru∣mental in betraying our liberties and selling us into the hands of tyranny by which together with their other iniquities they have contracted so great an odium in the hearts and eyes of all honest men that I Know not whether the hanging up of their gowns in Westminster Hall might not be as acceptable a tro∣phy in the eyes of the people as the Scotch colours  I have often wondered that notwithstanding the grace mischief the nation hath suffered by the lawyers  ning our laws and acts of parliaments being known  to leave flaws and always render them so lame they can for their advantage wrest them to what sense they please and thereby make themselves the lords and absolute arbitrators both of our lives and fortunes that for prevention of like future abuses they are not excluded the House of Commons as well as the Clergy there being as much reason and more precedent for the one than the other for that the Judges never had a vote in the House of Peers but only sat upon the Woolpack whereas the Bishops had like privileges with the other Lords It being very incongruous in reason that they should be the makers of our laws who are the mercenary Interpreters lest biassed by their own interests instead of fences to our properties they make them snares to our lives and estates  But it is hoped the prudence of our Senators will make so thorough a reformation of the Laws that as they are the birthright and inheritance of every En∣glishman and the interest of all persons to know and be intimately acquainted with them so they shall be rendered so facil and easy that the meanest capacity may conceive them at least so far as he is concerned therein that so there may be no longer any occasion of keeping up so corrupt an interest of men to make justice mercenary who have been always found the panders of tyranny and betrayers of our liberties and that for the future every man may be permitted to be his own orator and plead his own cause or pro∣cure what friend they please to be their advocates that right may be done gratis to every man and the cry of the oppressed may no longer be heard in our gates  But that judgment may run down like a stream and righteousness like a mighty torrent in the midst of our streets  I shall conclude with that honest desire of the inha∣bitants of Hull of late presented to the Parliament  That the laws by which this Commonwealth is to be go∣verned may be those holy just and righteous laws of the great and wise God our rightful lawgiver and where  any case is unprovided for in the express terms of his word care may be taken to determine it with the most exact proportion that is possible thereto  that so our laws being founded on the Scriptures and so composed as not only to have great affinity with but also to bor∣der on the very suburbs of divinity the greater re∣verence and authority may be conciliated to each and it may seem the less incongruous for our civil magistrates to be  utrisque peritus  skilful in both  Now whatsoever hath been here spoken out of a most intensely heated zeal for public good with re∣flection on the abuses of the law and the professors thereof I would not have misconstrued to reflect upon their persons which I honour and acknowledge many of them to be men of great candour and integrity but rather of the corrupt interest of the profession it being the design of these discourses to witness only against interests and not to revile or asperse the per∣sons of any whatsoever c  And indeed to speak my mind freely the grand error in the reformation of these times hath been its weeding out of persons when as the blow should have been levelled against the interests which notwith∣standing the frequent change of persons still take root and spring up in as great vigour as before and therefore I humbly conceive till the ax be laid to the root of every evil and corrupt interest we may not expect to reap any great fruit or success by our re∣formation for all flesh is corruptible and every man a lie nor is he that marches in the rear any better able to resist the temptation or avoid the snares of his place than he that fell before him  They may comment on the Two following

the Year    ISAIAH  Behold ye fast for Strife and De∣bate and to smite with the fist of WickednessIs not this the Fast that I have chosen to loose the Bands of Wickedness to undo the heavy Burdens and to let the Oppressed go free and that ye break every Yoke  ACCORDING to the stile of Revelation all un∣just and arbitrary decrees are  bands of wicked∣ness  by whatsoever human authority they are imposed because they are contrary to moral justice and are oppressive to the people And though they can never bind the consciences of men and so have no moral influence yet they are  cords of oppression  that sit hard upon their bodies and their temporal interest Laws that are unfriendly to the temporal interest and ge∣neral good of society laws that are made to exalt a few to power and dignity by spunging squeezing and oppressing all other ranks of people though con∣trived  trived by angels and executed by saints are  bands of wickedness  which may cause people to suffer for transgressing but can never create sin in disobey∣ing  When the Rulers of a Nation to gratify their own lusts of pride and ambition impose heavy and oppres∣sive burdens upon the people by legislative authority  they establish iniquity by a law  which in the strictest sense of the words is a  band of iniquity  The lusts of princes and their servants often create their own wants and render them necessitous they then make use of their power and influence to procure laws to oblige others to supply them whether they are able or not and what aggravates the evil when the sub∣jects know and feel that they are not able to answer the heavy demands of power they are not allowed to be judges of their own abilities Those that rule over others ought to be sober and temperate and make the reasonable finances of state serve them in executing their offices Unnecessary splendor and expence in government are inconsistent with both rea∣son and religion which teach us that it is one of the great ends of laws and government to restrain unruly appetites and passions It is sinful in princes to coin expensive offices to serve their favourites and oppress their subjects Nothing can be more audacious than for men appointed to be guardians of society with a design to make individuals easy and happy to pretend to come before the Lord in the most solemn manner to ask his aid and assistance to oppress them Such is undoubtedly the language of the ensuing Fast and of the conduct of its authors and devisers  The poor in all parts of Britain are groaning un∣der a heavy load of taxes devised for new purposes and imposed by new statutes But for what reasons Where is the necessity What way are they applied Are they not intended to carry violence and deso∣lation fire and sword among a people whose only fault is that they are endowed with principles and a  spirit which Englishmen once gloried in and which saved this nation from poverty and arbitrary power and will not part with what God and nature and the laws have given them to gratify the lusts of men who have degenerated from the noble generous temper of their ancestors into Eastern nabobs and Turkish bashaws These men have thought sit to contrive war foreign and domestic to gratify their depraved passions and the rich and poor throughout the nation must be oppressed to carry it on bands of wicked∣ness are twisted one year after another and the nation groans in chains All the necessaries of life are in some way or other taxed our smoke cannot ascend to the sky nor a ray of light peep in at our windows without paying an heavy impost The inside as well as the outside of our houses are assessed and poor people who cannot without great difficulty afford to pay five pounds for a house to lodge in through the year must now pay five sixpences more And for what reason to carry on a war that originated in in∣justice has been carried on with folly and attended with disgrace and disappointmentTo shed innocent blood and carry death and desolation across the At∣lantic to destroy our brethren to satiate the voracious lusts of a few ambitious men who would waste the globe and ruin Heaven itself provided they had the management thereof Ah Britain will the God of mercy who delights in forgiving offences hear your prayers or regard your fastings when you are twist∣ing cords of oppression instead of loosing bands of wickedness Ah ye Rulers of the Land whither are ye hastening you cannot run long when you are rushing upon the bosses of Jehovah's buckler  When you fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness  do you imagine that the God of Mercy will hear your prayers with acceptance or regard your fasting any otherwise than setting them down to the sum total of your past iniquities  ON THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS  By Mr  ERSKINE  in his Speech on the Trial of  THOMAS PAINE  From  Gurney's  Edition of the said Trial  EVERY man not intending to mislead and to confound but seeking to enlighten others with what his own reason and conscience however erro∣neously dictate to him as truth may address himself to the universal reason of a whole nation either upon the subject of governments in general or upon that of our own particular country he may analyse the principles of its constitution point out its errors and defects examine and publish its corruptions warn his fellowcitizens against their ruinous consequences and exert his whole faculties in pointing out the most advantageous changes in establishments which he considers to be radically defective or sliding from their object by abuse All this every subject of this country has a right to do if he contemplates only what he thinks its happiness and but seeks to change the public mind by the conviction which flows from reasonings dictated by conscience  If indeed he writes what he does not think if contemplating the misery of others he wickedly con∣demns what his own understanding approves or even admitting his real disgust against the govern∣ment or its corruptions if he calumniates  living ma∣gistrates  or holds out to individuals that they have a right to run before the public mind in their con∣duct that they may oppose by contumacy or force what private reason only disapproves that they may disobey the law because their judgment condemns it or resist the public will because they honestly wish to change it he is then a criminal upon every principle of rational policy as well as upon the im∣memorial  precedents of English justice because such a person seeks to disunite individuals from their duty to the whole and excites to overt acts of misconduct in a part of the community instead of endeavouring to change by the impulse of reason the universal ascent which in this and in every country constitutes the law for all  Gentlemen I say in the name of Thomas Paine and in his words as author of the Rights of Man as written in the very volume that is charged with seek∣ing the destruction of property  The end of all political associations is The pre∣servation of the Rights of Man which rights are Liberty Property and Security that the nation is the source of all sovereignty derived from it the right of property being secured and inviolable no one ought to be deprived of it except in cases of evident public necessity legally ascertained and on condition of a previous just indemnity  These are undoubtedly the rights of manthe rights for which all governments are establishedand the only rights Mr Paine contends for but which he thinks no matter whether right or wrong are better to be secured by a republican constitution than by the forms of the English government He in∣structs me to admit that when government is once constituted no individuals without rebellion can withdraw their obedience from itthat all attempts to excite them to it are highly criminal for the most obvious reasons of policy and justicethat no∣thing short of the Will of a whole people can change or effect the rule by which a nation is to be governed and that no private opinion however honestly ini∣micable to the forms or substance of the law can justify resistance to its authority while it remains in force The author of the Rights of Man not only admits the truth of all this doctrine but he consents to be convicted and I also consent for him unless his Work shall be found studiously and painfully to in∣culcate  culcate these great principles of government which it is charged to have been written to destroy Let me not therefore be suspected to be contending that it is lawful to write a book pointing out defects in the English government and exciting individuals to de∣stroy its sanctions and to refuse obedience But on the other hand I do contend that it is lawful to ad∣dress the English nation on these momentous subjects for had it not been for this unalienable right thanks be to God and our fathers for establishing it how should we have had this Constitution which we so loudly boast of If in the march of the human mind no man could have gone before the establishments of the time he lived in how could our establishment by reiterated changes have become what it is If no man could have awakened the public mind to errors and abuses in our government how could it have passed on from stage to stage through reformation and revolution so as to have arrived from barbarism to such a pitch of happiness and perfection that the Attorney General considers it as profanation to touch it any further or to look for any future amendment  In this manner power has reasoned in every age Government in  its own estimation  has been at all times a system of perfection but a free press has ex∣amined and detected its errors and the people have happily reformed them this freedom has alone made our government what it is and alone can preserve it and therefore under the banners of that freedom to∣day I stand up to defend Thomas Paine But how alas shall this task be accomplished How may I expect from you what human nature has not made man for the performance of How may I address your reasons or ask them to pause amidst the torrent of prejudice which has hurried away the public mind on the subject you are to judge  Was any Englishman ever so brought as a criminal before an English Court of JusticeIf I were to ask you Gentlemen of the Jury what is the choicest  fruit that grows upon the tree of English Liberty you would answer SECURITY UNDER THE LAW If I were to ask the whole people of England the return they looked for at the hands of Government for the burdens under which they bend to support it I should still be answered SECURITY UNDER THE LAW or in other words an impartial administration of justice So sacred therefore has the Freedom of Trial been ever held in England so anxiously does justice guard against every possible bias in her path that if the pub∣lic mind has been locally agitated upon any subject in judgment the forum is either changed or the trial postponed The circulation of any paper that brings or which can be supposed to bring prejudice or even wellfounded knowledge within the reach of a Bri∣tish tribunal on the spur of an occasion is not only highly criminal but defeats itself by leading to put of the trial which its object was to pervert On this principle his Lordship will permit me to remind him that on the trial of the Dean of St Asaph for a libel or rather when he was brought to trial the circulation of books by a society favourable to his defence was held by the noble Lord as Chief Justice of Chester to be a reason for not trying the cause although they contained no matter relative to the Dean nor to the object of his trial being only ex∣tracts from ancient authors of high reputation on the general Rights of Juries to consider the innocence as well as the guilt of the accused yet still as the re∣collection of these rights was pressed forward with a view to effect the proceedings to guard the principle the proceedings were postponed  Is the Defendant then to be the only exception to these admirable provisions Is the English law to judge him stript of the armour with which its uni∣versal justice encircles all others Shall we in the very act of judging him for detracting from the En∣glish government furnish him with ample matter for just reprobation instead of detraction Has not his  cause been prejudged through a thousand channels Has not the work before you been daily publicly re∣vived and his person held up to derision and re∣proach Has not the public mind been excited by crying down the very phrase and idea of the Rights of Man Nay have not associations of gentlemen I speak it with regret because I am persuaded from what I know of some of them that they amongst them at least thought they were serving the public yet have they not in utter contempt and ignorance of that Constitution of which they declare themselves to be the guardians published the grossest attacks upon the Defendant Have they not even while the cause has been standing here in the paper for im∣mediate trial published a direct protest against the very work now before you advertising in the same paper though under the general description of se∣ditious papers a reward on the conviction of any person who should dare to sell the book itself to which their own publication was an answerThe Attorney General has spoken of a forced circulation of this Work but how have these prejudging papers been circulated We all know how they have been thrown into our carriages in every street they have met us at every turnpike and they lie in the areas of all our houses To complete the triumph of prejudice that High Tribunal of which I have the honour to be a member my learned friends know what I say to be true has been drawn into this vor∣tex of slander and some of its members for I do not speak of the House itself have thrown the weight of their stations into the same scale  By all means I maintain that this cause has been prejudged  It may be said that I have made no motion to put off the trial for these causes and that courts of themselves take no cognizance of what passes else∣where without facts laid before them Gentlemen I know that I should have had equal justice from that  quarter if I had brought myself within the rule But when should I have been better in the present aspect of things And therefore I only remind you of all these hardships that you may recollect that your judg∣ment is to proceed upon that alone which meets you here upon the evidence in the cause and not upon suggestions destructive of every principle of justice  Having disposed of these foreign prejudices I hope you will as little regard some arguments that have been offered to you in court The letter which has been so repeatedly pressed upon you you ought to dismiss even from your recollection I have already put it out of the question as having been written long subsequent to the Book and as being a libel on the King which no part of the information charges and which may hereafter be prosecuted as a distinct offence I consider that letter besides and indeed have always beard it treated as a forgery contrived to injure the merits of the cause and to embarrass me person∣ally in its defence I have a right so to consider it because it is unsupported by any thing similar at an earlier period The Defendant's whole deportment previous to the publication has been wholly unexcep∣tionable he properly desired to be given up as the author of the Book if any enquiry should take place concerning it and he is not affected in evidence directly or indirectly with any illegal or suspicious conduct not even with having uttered an indiscreet or counting expression nor with any one matter or thing inconsistent with the duty of the best subject in England His opinions indeed were not adverse to our system but I maintain that OPINION is  free  and that CONDUCT  alone  is amenable to the law  You are next to judge of the author's mind and intention by the modes and extent of the circu∣lation of his work The First Part of the Rights of Man Mr Attorney General tells you he did not prosecute although it was in circulation through the country for a year and a half together because it  seems it circulated only amongst what he stiles the judi∣cious part of the public who possessed in their capa∣cities and experience an antidote to the poison but that with regard to the Second Part now before you its circulation had been forced into every corner of society had been printed and reprinted for cheapness even upon whited brown paper and had crept into the very nurseries of children as a wrapper for their sweetmeats  In answer to this statement which after all stand only upon Mr Attorney General's own assertion un∣supported by any kind of proof no witness having proved the author's personal interference with the sale I still maintain that if he had the most anxi∣ously promoted it the question would remain exactly the same the question would still be whether at the time when Paine composed his work and promoted the most extensive purchase of it he believed or dis∣believed what he had written and whether he con∣templated the happiness or the misery of the English nation to which it is addressed and which ever of these intentions may be evidenced to your judgments upon reading the Book itself I confess I am utterly at a loss to comprehend how a writer can be supposed to mean something different from what he has written by an axiety common I belive to all authors that his work should be generally read  Remember I am not asking your opinions of the  doctrines themselves  you know them already pretty visibly since I began to address you but I shall ap∣peal not only to you but to those who without our leave will hereafter judge without appeal of all that we are doing to day whether upon the matter which I hasten to lay before you you can refuse in justice to pronounce that from his educationfrom the accidents and habits of his lifefrom the time and occasion of the publicationfrom the circum∣stances attending itand from every line and letter of the work itsself and all his other writings before and  even since  his conscience and understanding  no  matter whether erroneously or not  were deeply and solemnly impressed with the matters contained in his Bookthat he addressed it to the reason of the nati∣on at large and not to the passions of individuals and that in the issue of its influence he contemplated only what appeared to  him though it may not to us  to be the interest and happiness of England and of the whole human race In drawing the one or the other of these conclusions the Book stands first in order and it shall now speak for itself  Gentlemen the whole of it is in evidence before you the particular parts arraigned having only been read by my consent upon the presumption that on retiring from the court you would caresully com∣pare them with the context and all the parts with the whole viewed together You cannot indeed do justice without it The most common letter even in the ordinary course of business cannot be read in a cause to prove an obligation for twenty shillings with∣out the whole being read that the writer's meaning may be seen without deception But in a criminal charge of only four pages and a half out of a work containing nearly two hundred you cannot with even the appearance of common justice pronounce a judgment without the most deliberate and cautious comparison I observe that the noble and learned Judge confirms me in this observation But if any given part of a work be legally explanatory of every other part of it the preface a  fortiori  is the most ma∣terial because the preface is the author's own key to his writing it is there that he takes the reader by the hand and introduces him to his subject it is there that the spirit and intention of the whole is laid before him by way of prologue A preface is meant by the author as a clue to ignorant or careless readers the author says by it to every man who chooses to begin where he oughtlook at my planattend to my distinctionsmark the purpose and limitations of the matter I lay before you  To be continued  THE NEW CONSTITUTION OF FRANCE  As accepted by the Nation on the  th  of August    DECLARATION OF RIGHTS  THE French people convinced that forgetfulness of and contempt for the natural rights of man are the only causes of the crimes and misfortunes of the world have resoved to expose in a Declaration their sacred and inclienable right in order that all Citizens being always able to compare the acts of the government with the end of every social institu∣tion may never suffer themselves to be oppressed and degraded by tyranny and that the people may al∣ways have before their eyes the basis of their liberty and happiness the magistrates the rule of their duty and legislators the object of their mission  They acknowledge therefore and proclaim in the presence of the Surreme Being  the following De∣claration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens  ARTICLE I The end of society is common hap∣piness Government is instituted to secure to man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights  II These rights are Equality Liberty Safety and Property  III All men are equal by nature and before the law  IV The Law is the free and solemn expression of the general will It ought to be the same for all whether it protects or punishes It cannot order but what is just and useful to Society It cannot forbid but what is hurtful  V All Citizens are equally admissible to public employments Free people know no other motives of preserence in their elections than virtue and talents  VI Liberty is that power which belongs to a man of doing every thing that does not hurt the rights of another Its principle is nature Its rule justice Its protection the law And its moral limits are detined by this maxim "Do not to another what you would not wish done to yourself"  VII The rights of manifesting one's thoughts and opinions either by the press or in any other manner the right of assembling peaceably and the free exercise of religious worship cannot be forbid∣den The necessity of announcing these rights sup∣poses either the presence or the recent remembrance of despotism  VIII Whatever is not forbidden by the law can∣not be prevented No one can be forced to do that which it does not order  IX Safety consists in the protection granted by the Society to each Citizen for the preservation of his person his rights and his property  X The Law avenges public and individual li∣berty of the abuses committed against them by power  XI No person can be accused arrested or con∣fined but in cases determined by the law and ac∣cording to the forms which it prescribes Every Citizen summoned or seized by the authority of the law ought immediately to obey he renders himself culpable by resistance  XII Every act exercised against a man to which the cases in the law do not apply and in which its forms are not observed is arbitrary and tyrannical Respect for the law forbids him to submit to such acts and if attempts are made to execute them by violence he has a right to repel force by force  XIII Those who shall solicit dispatch sign exe∣cute or cause to be executed arbitrary acts are cul∣pable and ought to be punished  XIV Every man being supposed innocent until he has been declared guilty if it is judged indispen∣sible  to arrest him all severity not necessary to secute his person ought to be strictly represied by the law  XV No one ought to be tried and punished until he has been legally summoned and in virtue of a law published previous to the commistion of the crime A law which should punish crimes committed before it  isted would be tyrannical The retroactive effect given to a law would be a crime  XVI The law ought not to decree any punish∣ments but such as are strictly and evidently necessary punishment ought to be proportioned to the crime and a  ul to society  XVII The right of property is that right which belongs to every Citizen to enjoy and dispose of ac∣cording to his pleasure his property revenues labour and industry  XVIII No kind of labour culture or commerce can be forbidden to the industrious Citizen  XIX Every man may engage his services and his time but he cannot sell himselfhis person is not alienable property The law does not acknowledge servitudethere can exist only an engagement of care and gratitude between the man who labours and the man who employs him  XX No one can be deprived of the smallest por∣tion of his property without his consent except when the public necessity legally ascertained evi∣dently require it and on condition of a just and pre∣vious indemnification  XXI No contribution can be established but for general utility and to relieve the public wants Every Citizen has a right to concur in the establishment of contributions to watch over the use made of them and to call for a statement of expenditure  XXII Public aids are a sacred debt The So∣ciety is obliged to provide for the subsistence of the unfortunate either by procuring them work or by securing the means of existence to those who are un∣able to labour  XXIII Instruction is the want of all and the Society ought to favour with all its power the pro∣gress of public reason and to place instruction within the reach of every Citizen  XXIV The social guarantee consists in the ac∣tions of all to secure to each the enjoyment and pre∣servation of his rights This guarantee rests on the National Sovereignty  XXV The social guarantee cannot exist if the limits of public functions are not clearly determined by the law and if the responsibility of all public functionaties is not secured  XXVI The Sovereignty resides in the people it is one and indivisible imprescriptible and inalienable  XXVII No proportion of the people can exer∣cise the power of the whole but each Section of the Sovereign assembled ought to enjoy the right of ex∣pressing its will in perfect liberty Every individual who arrogates to himself the Sovereignty or who usurps the exercise of it ought to be put to death by free men  XXVIII A people have always the right of re∣vising amending and changing their Constitution One generation cannot subject to its law future ge∣nerations  XXIX Every Citizen has an equal right of con∣curring in the formation of the law and in the no∣mination of his mandatories or agents  XXX Public functions cannot be considered as distinctions or rewards but as duties  XXXI Crimes committed by the mandatories of the people and their agents ought never to remain unpunished No one has a right to pretend to be more inviolable than other Citizens  XXXII The right of presenting petitions to the depositories of public authority belongs to every indi∣vidual The exercise of this right cannot in any case be forbidden suspended or limited  XXXIII Resistance to oppression is the conse∣quence of the other rights of man  XXXIV Oppression is exercised against the so∣cial body when even one of its members is oppressed Oppression is exercised against each member when the social body is oppressed  XXXV When the government violates the rights of the people insurrection becomes to the people and to every portion of the people the most sacred and the most indispensible of duties  To be continued  ENGLISH INJUSTICE TO THE FRENCH  WHEN exulting we tell how our fathers of yore  Their wrongs and oppressions were wont to redress  How firmly they waded through rivers of gore  And fore'd from proud despots those rights we possess  When we boast of our own revolution and laws  Yet reprobate men who have spurn'd base controul  We may shew an acquaintance with Liberty's cause  But we strongly evince a contraction of soul  We deem ourselves lodg'd under Liberty's tree  Where the whole human race might with comfort recline  We boast of the blessingand Britons shall we  At the joyous approach of our neighbours repine  Forbid itye offspring of men who were tried  Of men who unshackled both body and mind  Forbid itand learn ere ye dare to deride  That the cause of the French is the cause of mankind  How can WE if our sires be entitled to praise  For boldly resisting unauthoriz'd sway  How can we with aversion on Liberty gaze  How can we be offended if tyrants decay  Has Jehovah selected a newchosen race  And on them and them only his freedom bestow'd  If nothow can Gallic resistance be base  And the fate of a James shew the finger of God  When the orbs of the sightless receive the bright Day  Shall those who have vision presume to complain  Shall men sav'd from shipwreck with anguish survey  Their fellows preserv'd from the merciless main  How degrading the thoughtyet the sons of this Isle  Who deem themselves nurtur'd at Liberty's board  Evince a malignity equally vile  In wishing thy shackles O Gallia restor'd  When the will of a driv'ler held millions in chains  Did we pity themnowe despis'd them as slaves  And now not a trace of debasement remains  We brand the brave people as maniacs and knaves  Thus servile or free we the French have revil'd  Our own halfform'd system we proudly commend  We boast our wise lawsthough our code is defil'd  With statutes that tyrants would blush to defend  O spurn the mean prejudice Britons and say  If our fathers are right how can Frenchmen be wrong  The will of oppressors both scorn'd to obey  And asserted those rights that to mortals belong  Yet the struggles of these are to infamy hurl'd  While the actions of those we with triumph rehearse  But the bright orb of reason now peeps on the World  And the thick clouds of prejudice soon shall disperse  Yes soon shall these truths far and wide be convey'd  'Spite of Pindar's poor prattle and Burke's raving din  That the thrones of true kings by the PEOPLE are made  And when kings become tyrantssubmission is sin  That the power of oppressors can ne'er be of Heaven  A Being alljustcannot justice despise  A Being alljustEQUAL RIGHTS must have given  And who robs man of these must offend the Allwise  ROMAN HISTORY  continued from Page    AFTER the expulsion of the Tarquins Rome was governed by two consuls who held their office during the space of a year at the conclusion of which new ones were chosen by the senate and people After some time the people found themselves very much oppressed by the patricians who engrossed the whole power of the state and by various extortions such as lending them money at exorbitant interest and the like had got possession of all their lands and often seized their persons imprisoned or used them as slaves the laws permitting it in the case of the nonpayment of their debts in a barbarous manner Unable to bear this cruel treatment a number of them at the instigation of Sisinnius Bellutus and another Junius Brutus took an opportunity when the state had great need of their assistance to desert their generals and retired to a hill three miles from Rome In this exigence a deputation was sent to them from the senate persuading them with many fair promises to return At the head of this deputation were T Lartius Menenius Agripah and M Valerius all three in great esteem and of whom two had governed the republic and commanded her armies in quality of dictator When they were introduced to the camp of the malecontents and had given an account of their commission Junius Brutus perceiving his comrades continued in profound silence and that none of them attempted to make himself an advocate in the cause stepped forward and thus addressed them  "One would imagine fellowsoldiers by this deep silence that you are still awed by that servile sear in which the patricians and your creditors have kept you so long Every man consults the eyes of the rest to discover whether there be more resolution in others than he finds in himself and not one of you has the courage to speak in public that which is the con∣stant subject of your private conversation Do you not know that you are free This camp these arms do they not convince you that you are no longer under tyrants And if you could still doubt it would not this step which the senate has taken be sufficient to sa∣tisfy you Those patricians so haughty and im∣perious now send to court us they no longer make use of proud commands or cruel threats they in∣vite us as their fellowcitizens to return into our com∣mon city nay some of our sovereigns you see are so gracious as to come to our very camp to offer us a general pardon Whence then can proceed this obstinate silence after such singular condescensions If you doubt the sincerity of their promises if you fear that under the veil of a few fine words they conceal your former chains why do ye not speak Declare your thoughts freely Or if you dare not open your mouths at least hear a Roman who has courage enough to fear nothing but the not speaking the truth Then turning to Valerius You invite us to return to Rome but you do not tell us upon what conditions Can plebeians poor yet free think of being united with patricians so rich and so ambitious And even though we should agree to the conditions you have to offer what security will the patricians give us for the performance those haughty patricians who make it a merit among themselves to have deceived the people You talk to us of nothing but pardon and forgiveness as if we were your subjects and subjects in rebellion but that is the point to be discussed Is it the people or the senate who are in fault Which of the two or∣ders  was it that first violated the laws of society which ought to reign among the members of the same republie This is the question In order to judge of this without prejudice give me leave barely to relate a certain number of facts for the truth of which I will appeal to no other but yourselt and your colleague Our state was founded by kings and never was the Roman people more free and more happy than under their government Tarqu  n himself the last of those princes Tarquin so  ots to the senate and the nobility savoured our interests as much as he opposed yours Nevertheless to avenge your wrongs we drove that prince from Rome we took arms against a sovereign who defended him∣self only with the prayers he made to leave your in∣terests and to return to his obedience We afterwards cut to pieces the armies of Veil and Tarquinii which endeavoured to restore him to the throne The formidable power of Porsenna the famine we underwent during a long siege the fierce assaults the continual battles were all these or in short was any thing capable of shaking the faith which we had given you Thirty Latine cities united to restore the Tarquines What would you have done then if we had abandoned you and joined your enemies What rewards might we not have obtained of Tar∣quin while the senate and nobles would have been the victims of his resentment Who was it that dis∣persed this dangerous combination To whom are you obliged for the defeat of the Latines Is it not to this people Is it not to them that you owe that very power which you have since turned against them What recompence have we had for the as∣sistance we lent you Is the condition of the Roman people one jot the better Have you associated them in your offices and dignities Have our poor ci∣tizens found so much as the smallest relief in their necessities On the contrary have not our bravest soldiers oppressed with the weight of usury been  groaning in the chains of their merciless creditors What has come of all those vain promises of abolish∣ing in time of peace the debts which the great had forced us to contract Scarce was the war finished but you alike forgot our services and your oaths With what designs then do you come hither Why do you try to reduce this people by the enchantment of your words Are there any oaths so solemn as to bind your faith And after all what would you get by an union brought about by artifice kept up with mutual distrust and which at last must end in a civil war Let us on both sides avoid such heavy misfortunes let us not lose the happiness of our separa∣tion suffer us to depart from a country where we are loaded with chains like so many slaves and where being reduced to be only farmers of our own inheri∣tances we are forced to cultivate them for the profit of our tyrants So long as we have our swords in our hands we shall be able to open ourselves a way into more fortunate climates and wherever the Gods shall grant us to live in liberty there shall we sind our country"  By this and frequent struggles of this sort which the people had made before they at length attained the establishment of the tribuneship which consisted of two officers annually chosen out of the order of the plebeians with authority to prevent the injustices that might be done to the people and to defend their interests both public and private Rome by this establishment made a great advance towards a new change in the form of her government It had passed before from the monarchic state to a state of aristo∣cracy for upon the expulsion of Tarquin the whole authority did really and in fact devolve upon the se∣nate and the great But now by the creation of the tribunes a democracy began to take place and the people by insensible degtees and under different pretences got possession of the much greater share in the government A famine which raged at Rome  soon after the establishment of this office oc∣casions great complaints amongst the people and a large supply of corn being procured from Sicily by the patricians Coriolanus a young senator who had done great services to the state as a general is for taking advantage of the people's distress to get the tribuneship abolished which he proposes in the senate The tribunes and the people enraged at this determined to prosecute Coriolanus and after much altercation desire to be heard by the senate in  lation to their charge against him where Decius one of the tribunes makes the following speech  "You know Conscript Fathers that having by our assistance expelled Tarquin and abolished the regal power you established in the republic the form of government which is now observed in it and of which we do not complain But neither can you be ignorant that in all the differences which any poor plebeian had afterwards with wealthy patricians those plebeians constantly lost their causes their ad∣versaries being their judges and all the tribunals being filled with patricians only This abuse was what made Valerius Poplicola that wise consul and excellent citizen establish the law which granted an appeal to the people from the decrees of the senate and the judgments of the consuls  "Such is the law called Valeria which has always been looked upon as the basis and foundation of the public liberty It is to this law that we now fly for redress if you refuse us the justice we demand upon a man black with the greatest crime that it is possible to commit in a republic It is not a single plebeian complaining it is the whole body of the Roman people demanding the coudemnation of a tyrant who would have destroyed his fellow citizens by famine has violated our magistracy and forcibly repulsed our officers and the aediles of the commonwealth Cori∣olanus is the man we accuse of having proposed the  abolition of the tribuneship a magistracy made sa∣cred by the most solemn oaths What need is there of a  senatus consulium  to prosecute a criminal like this Does not every man know that those particular de∣crees of the senate are requisite only in unforeseen and extraordinary affairs and for which the laws have as yet made no provision But in the present case where the law is so direct where it expressly devotes to the infernal gods those who infringe it is it not to become an accomplice in the crime to hesitate in the least Are you not apprehensive that these affected delays this obstruction you throw in the way of our proceedings against this criminal by the pre∣tended necessity of a previous decree of the senate will make the people inclined to believe that Corio∣lanus only spoke the sentiments of you all  "I know that several among you complain it was merely by violence we extorted your consent for the abolition of the debts and the establishment of the tribuneship I will even suppose that in the high degree of power to which you had raised yourselves after the expulsion of Tarquin it was neither con∣venient nor honorable for you to yield up part of it in favour of the people but you have done it and the whole senate is bound by the most solemn oaths never to undo it After the establishment of those sacred laws which render the persons of the tribunes inviolable will ye  in compliance with the first ambi∣tious man that arises attempt to revoke what makes the peace and security of the state Certainly you never will and I dare answer for you so long as I behold in this assembly those venerable magistrates who had so great a share in the treaty upon the  mons sacer  Ought you to suffer a matter like this to be so much as brought into deliberation Coriolanus is the first who by his seditious advice has endeavoured to break those sacred bands which strengthened by the laws unite the several orders of the state It is he alone who is for destroying the tribunitian power  the people's assylum the bulwark of our liberty and the pledge of our reunion In order to force the people's consent in order to perpetrate one crime he attempted another much greater He dares even in a holy place and in the midst of the senate propose to let the people die of hunger Cruel and unthink∣ing man at the same time Did he not consider that this people whom he meant to exterminate with so much inhumanity and who are more numerous and powerful than he could wish being reduced to despair would have broken into the houses forced open those granaries and those cellars which conceal so much wealth and would rather have fallen under the power of the patricians or have totally rooted out that whole orderCould he imagine that an enraged populace would have hearkened to any law but what was dictated by necessity and resentment  "For that you may not be unacquainted with the truth we would not have perished by a famine brought upon us by our enemies but having called to witness the gods revengers of injustice we would have filled Rome with blood and slaughter Such had been the fatal consequences of the counsels of that perfidious citizen if some senators who had more love for their country had not hindered them from taking effect It is to you Conscript Fathets that we address our just complaints It is to your aid and to the wisdom of your decrees that we have re∣course to oblige this public enemy to appear before the whole Roman people and answer for his perni∣cious counsels It is there Coriolanus that thou must defend thy former sentiments if thou darest so to do or excuse them from proceeding from want of thought Take my advice leave thy haughty and tyrannical maxims make thyself less become like us nay put on a habit of mourning so suitable to thy present fortune Implore the pity of thy fel∣lowcitizens and perhaps thou mayest obtain their favour and the forgiveness of thy fault"  Co  iolanus was given up to be tried by the tri∣bunes of the people by whom he was condemned to perpetual banishment  To be continued    Continuation of Mr  ERSKINE'S Defence of PAINE  and of  The Liberty of the Press  from page    LET then the calumniators of Thomas Paine now attend to his Preface where to leave no excuse for ignorance or misrepresentation he expresses himself thus  I have differed from some professional gentle∣men on the subject of prosecutions and I since find they are falling into my opinion which I will here state as fully but as concisely as I can  I will first put a case with respect to any law and then compare it with a government or with what in England is or has been called a Con∣stitution  It would be an act of despotism or what in England is called arbitrary power to make a law to prohibit investigating the principles good or bad on which such a law or any other is founded  If a law be bad it is one thing to oppose the practice of it but it is quite a different thing to expose its errors to reason on its defects and to shew cause why it should be repealed or why another ought to be substituted in its place I have always held it an opinion making it also my practice that it is better to obey a bad law making use at the same time of every argument to shew its errors and procure its repeal than forcibly to violate it because the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force and  lead to a discretionary violation of those which are good  The case is the same with principles and forms of government or to what are called constitutions and the parts of which they are composed  It is for the good of nations and not for the emolument or aggrandisement of particular indi∣viduals that government ought to be established and that mankind are at the expence of support∣ing it The defects of every government and con∣stitution both as to principle and form must on a parity of reasoning be as open to discussion as the defects of a law and it is a duty which every man owes to society to point them out When those defects and the means of remedying them are generally seen by a nation that nation will reform its government or its constitution in the one case as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other  Gentlemen you must undoubtedly wish to deal with every man who comes before you in judgment as you would be dealt by yourselves and surely you will not lay it down as a law to be binding hereafter even upon yourselves that if you should publish any opinion concerning the existing abuses in your coun∣try's government and point out to the whole public the means of amendment you are to be acquitted or convicted as any twelve men may happen to agree with you in your opinions Yet this is precisely what you are asked to do to another it is pre∣cisely the case before you Mr Paine expressly says I obey a law until it is repealed obedience is not only my principle but my practice since my disobedience of a law from thinking it bad might apply to justify another man in the disobedience of a good one and thus individuals would give the rule for themselves and not society for all  Gentlemen you will presently see that the same principle pervades the rest of the work and I am  the more anxious to call your attention to it how∣ever repetition may tire you because it unfolds the whole principle of my argument for if you find a sentence in the whole book that invests any indivi∣dual or any number of individuals or any commu∣nity short of the whole nation with a power of changing any part of the law or constitution I aban∣don the causeYES I freely abandon it because I will not affront the majesty of a court of justice by maintaining propositions which even upon the sur∣face of them are falseMr Paine page goes on thus  When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking it is no longer to be governed as before but it would not only be wrong but bad policy to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason Rebellion consists in forcibly opposing the general will of a nation whether by a party or by a government There ought therefore to be in every nation a method of occasionally ascertaining the state of public opinion with respect to govern∣ment  There is therefore no power but the voluntary Will of the People that has a right to act in any matter respecting a general Reform and by the same right that two persons can confer on such a subject a thousand may The object in all such preliminary proceedings is to find out what the general sense of a nation is and to be governed by it If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform or chuse to pay ten times more taxes than there is occasion for it has a right so to do and so long as the majority do not impose con∣ditions on the minority different to what they im∣pose on themselves though there may be much error there is no injustice neither will the error continue long Reason and discussion will soon bring things right however wrong they may be∣gin By such a process no tumult is to be appre∣hended  The poor in all countries are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their interest and happiness are included It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous  Gentlenen these are the sentiments of the Author of the Rights of Man and whatever his opinions may be of the defects in our government it can never change our sentiments concerning it if our senti∣ments are just and a writing can never be seditious in the sense of the English law which states that the government leans on the universal will for its sup∣port  Gentlemen this universal will is the best and se∣curest title which his Majesty and his family have to the throne of these Kingdoms and in proportion to the wisdom of our institutions the title must in com∣mon sense become the stronger so little idea indeed have I of any other that in my place in parliament not a week ago I considered it as the best way of expressing my attachment to the constitution as esta∣blished at the Revolution to declare I believe in the presence of the Heir Apparent of the Crown for whom I have the greatest personal zeal that his Majesty reigned in England by choice and consent as the magistrate of the English people not indeed a consent and choice by personal election like a King of Po∣land the worst of all possible constitutions but by the election of a family for great national objects in defiance of that hereditary right which only becomes tyranny in the sense of Mr Paine when it claims to inherit a nation instead of governing by their con∣sent and continuing for its benefit  Gentlemen this sentiment has the advantage of Mr Burke's high authority he says with great truth in a letter to his constituents  Too little dependance cannot be had at this time of day on names and pre∣judices the eyes of mankind are opened and com∣munities must be held together by a visible and solid  interest  I believe Gentlemen of the Jury that the Prince of Wales will always render this title dear to the people The Attorney General can only tell you what he believes of him I can tell you what I know and what I am bound to declare since this Prince may be traduced and calumniated in every part of the Kingdom without its coming into question till brought in to load a defence with matter collateral to the charge I therefore assert what the Attorney General can only hope that whenever that Prince shall ever come to the throne of this Country which I hope but by the course of nature will never happen he will make the Constitution of Great Britain the foundation of all his conduct  Having now Gentlemen established the Author's general intention by his own introduction which is the best and fairest exposition let us next look at the oc∣casion which

Exemplified in the LIFE OF A PRIVATE SOLDIER  From the  Citizen of the World  By Dr  Goldsmith  THE misfortunes of the great my friend are held up to engage our attention are enlarged upon in tones of declamation and the world is called upon to  gaze at the noble sufferers they have at once the comfort of admiration and pity  Yet where is the magnanimity of bearing misfortunes when the whole world is looking on Men in such  hances can act bravely even from motives of vanity He only who in the vale of obscurity can  ave a svertity who without friends to encourage as quaintances to pity or even without hope to allevi∣ate his distresses can behave with tranquility and in∣diference is truly great whether peasant or cour∣tier be deserves admiration and should be held up for our imitation and respect  The miseries of the poor are however entirely disregarded though some undergo more real hard∣ships in one day than the great in their whole lives It is indeed inconceivable what difficulties the meanest English sailor or soldier endures without murmuring or regret Every day to him is a day of misery and yet he bears his hard fate without repining  With what indignation do I hear the heroes of tra∣gedy complain of misfortunes and hardships whose greatest calamity is founded in arrogance and pride Their severest distresses are pleasures compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day sustain without murmuring These may eat drink and sleep have slaves to attend them and are sure of sustenence for life while many of their fellowcrea∣tures are obliged to wander without a friend to com∣fort or to assist them find enmity in every law and are too poor to obtain even justice  I have been led into these reflections from acci∣dentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow beg∣ging at one of the outlets of the town with a wooden leg I was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation and after giving him what I thought proper desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress The disabled soldier for such he was with an intrepidity truly British  leaning on his crutch put himself into an attitude to comply with my request and gave me his history as follows  'As for misfortunes Sir I can't pretend to have gone through more than others Except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg I don't know any reason thank heaven that I have to complain there are some that have lose both legs and an eye but thank heaven it is not quite so bad with me  'My father was a labourer in the country and died when I was five years old so I was put upon the parish As he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged or where I was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third till at h  it was thought I be longed to no parish at all At length however they sixed me I had some dis∣position to be a scholar and had actually learned my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet  'Here I lived an easy kind of a life for five years I only wrought ten hours in the day and had my meat and drink provided for my labour It is true I was not suffered to stir far from the house for fear I should run away but what of that I had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for me  'I was next bound out to a farmer where I was up both early and late but I eat and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died Be∣ing then obliged to provide for myself I was resolved to go and seek my fortune Thus I lived and went from town to town working when I could get em∣ployment and starving when I could get none and might have lived so still but happening one day to go through a field belonging to a magistrate I spy'd a hare crossing the path just before me I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it well what will you have on't I kill'd the hare and was  bringing it away in triumph when the justice him∣self met me he called me a villain and collering me desired I would give an account of myself I began immediately to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed seed and generation but though I gave a very long account the justice said I could give no account of myself so I was indicted and  found guilty of being poor  and sent to Newgate in or∣der to be transported to the plantations  'People may say this and that of being in jail but for my part I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life I had my belly full to eat and drink and did no work but alas this kind of life was too good to last for ever I was taken out of prison after five months put on board of a ship and sent off with two hundred more Our pas∣sage was but indifferent for we were all confined in the hold and died very fast for want of sweet air and provisions but for my part I did not want meat because I had a fever all the way providence was kind when provisions grew short it took away my desire of eating When we came on shore we were sold to the Planters I was bound for seven years and as I was no scholar for I had forgot my letters I was obliged to work among the negroes and served out my time as in duty bound to do  'When my time was expired I worked my passage home and glad I was to see Old England again because I loved my Country O Liberty Liberty Liberty that is the property of every En∣glishman and I will die in it's defence I was afraid however that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go into the coun∣try but kept about town and did little jobs when I get them I was very happy in this manner for some time till one evening coming home from work two men knocked me down and then defired me to stand still They belonged to a press gang I was carried before the justice and as I could give no ac∣count  count of my self that was the thing that always hob∣bled me I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier I chose to be a soldier and in this part of a gentleman I served two campaigns was at the battles in Flanders and received but one wound through the breast which is troublesome to this day  'When the peace came on I was discharged and as I could not work because my wound was some∣times painful I listed for a landsman in the East India Company's service I here fought the French in six pitched battles and verily believe that if I could read or write our Captain would have given me promo∣tion and made me a corporal But that was not my good fortune I soon fell sick and when I became good for nothing got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket which I saved in the ser∣vice This was at the beginning of the present war so I hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and I was pressed again before ever I could set foot on shore  'The boatswain found me as he said an obsti∣nate fellow he swore that I understood my business perfectly well but that I pretended sickness merely to be idle God knows I knew nothing of sea busi∣ness He beat me without considering what he was about But still my forty pounds was some comfort to me under every beating the money was my com∣fort and the money I might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the French and so I lost it all  'Our crew was carried into a French prison and many of them died because they were not used to live in a jaiI but for my part it was nothing to me for I was seasoned One night however as I was sleeping on the bed of boards with a warm blanket about me for I always loved to lie well I was awak∣ed by the boatswain who had a dark lanthorn in his  hand Jack says he to me will you knock out the French centry's brains I don't care says I striving to keep myself awake if I lend a hand Then follow me says he and I hope we shall do business So up I got and tied my blanket which was all the cloaths I had about my middle and went with him to fight the Frenchmen we had no arms but one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time so we went down to the door where both the centries were post∣ed and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down From thence nine of us ran together to the Quay and seizing the first boat we met got out of the harbour and put to sea We had not been here three days before we were taken by an English privateer who was glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance However we had not so much luck as we expected In three days we fell in with a French man of War of forty guns while we had but twen∣tythree so to it we went The fight lasted for three hours and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman but unfortunately we lost almost all our men just as we were going to get the victory I was once more in the power of the French and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to my old jail in Brest but by good fortnue we were retaken and carried to England once more  I had almost forgot to tell you that in this last en∣gagement I was wounded in two places I lost four fingers of the left hand and my leg was cut off Had I the good fortune to have lost my leg and the use of my hand on board a king's ship and not a privateer I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another a wooden ladle However blessed be God I enjoy good health and have no enemy in this  world that I know of but the French and the justice of peace'  Thus saying he limped off leaving my friend and me in admiration of his intrepidity and content  ON KINGS  From  Godwin  's Enquiry concerning Political Justice  MONARCHY is so unnatural an institution that mankind have at all times strongly suspected it was unfriendly to their happiness The power of truth upon important topies is such that it may rather be said to be obscured than obliterated and falshood has scarcely ever been so successful as not to have had a ref  ess and powerful antagonist in the heart of its vo∣taries The man who with difficulty earns his scanty subsistence cannot behold the ostentatious splendor of a king without being visited by some sense of injustice He inevitably questions in his mind the utility of an officer whose services are hired at so enormous a price If he confider the subject with any degree of accuracy he is led to perceive and that with suffici∣ent surprise that a king is nothing more than a com∣mon mortal exceeded by many and equalled by more in every requisite of strength capacity and virtue He feels therefore that nothing can be more ground∣less and unjust than the supposing that one such man as this is the fittest and most competent instrument for regulating the affairs of nations  These reflections are so unavoidable that Kings themselves have often been aware of the danger to their imaginary happiness with which they are preg∣nant They have sometimes been alarmed with the progress of thinking and oftener regarded the ease and prosperity of their subjects as a fource of terror  and apprehension They justly consider their functions as a sort of public exhibition the success of which depends upon the credulity of the spectators and which good sense and courage would speedily bring to a termination Hence the well known maxims of mo∣narchial government that ease is the parent of rebel∣lion and that it is necessary to keep the people in a state of poverty and endurance in order to render them submissive Hence it has been the perpetual com∣plaint of despotism that "the restive knaves are over∣run with ease and plenty ever is the nurse of faction  Tragedy of Jane Shore Act III  " Hence it has been the lesson perpetually read to mo∣narchs "Render your subjects prosperous and they will speedily refuse to labour they will become stub∣born proud unsubmissive to the yoke and ripe for revolt It is impotence and misery that alone will render them supple and prevent them from rebelling against the dictates of authority  Telemaque Liv  XIII  "  To be continued  ON THE REBELLION OF PRINCES  Isaiah xxiii  Thy Princes are rebellions and Com∣panions of Thieves every one loveth Gifts and fol∣loweth after Rewards they judge not the Father∣less neither doth the Cause of the Widow come before them  From  FastDay Sermons  by the Rev  J Murray  of  Newcastle  Author of  Sermons to Asses  Printed in the Year    PRINCES may be rebellious by joining interests and partnership with thieves and dishonest per∣sons These are such as take what is not their own  and apply it to their own purposes This is a coarse compliment to princes but as it is given by an inspired Prophet it cannot be taken amiss  It is rebellion against God and the laws for rulers to take more than justly is due to them or join interests with those who do  It is also dishonest to promote or procure laws that may make it legal to give them more than the people can afford this comes under the notion of theft and rebellion according to the Prophet's idea  The Princes of Judah and Israel went partners with the Sovereign in the plunder of the Nation They probably voted large supplies to the king because they knew they would receive a share of the revenue and might promote a law for encreasing the civil list in hopes of serving in his Majesty's houshold but this was theft and rebellion against justice and the laws of the land  Those who obey the fundamental laws of govern∣ment cannot be rebels though it is manifest that legis∣lators that make laws contrary to natural justice and the law of God may be guilty of rebellion  Not executing the laws impartially is joined with rebellion or is rather a part of it The fatherless and the widow were either neglected or made seel all the force of penal laws when they were guilty when those who had influence in a tribe or could serve the ends of administration were rescued from justice when they had committed the most capital crimes  This is by the Prophet accounted the very height of rebellion and is often committed by princes and their companions  Thus it is plain that rebellion is not a crime pecu∣  far to the people only but is also sometimes to be found at the very springs of government  Some would make us believe that kings and princes cannot be guilty of rebellion but the scripture informs us otherwise  As we are certain from the best authority that even  princes may rebel the question now is whether they ought to be punished for it like other rebels and who can lawfully punish them This question requires a little caution and must be determined by scripture and it is hoped that then no Christian will dissent from the conclusion  Whether there is any difference between trying Kings and Princes for rebellion and punishing them without trying them I shall leave to the Tories and Causuists to determine For there has been more noise concerning the trial of King Charles the First than concerning the punishment of all the rebellious princes since the Conquest  This Prince is the only martyr we find among the Kings of England though many of them have suffer∣ed for their tytanny and rebellion against the laws  The Kings in this country are considered as the source of the laws and it is supposed that if the King could die that all law would be at an end for this reason the lawyers have made our kings immortal and laid it down as a first principle that the King can∣not die  It ought to have been seriously considered before such a mysterious maxim had been laid down as a first principle whether laws or Kings were first ap∣pointed by the Almighty for if ever we find laws without Kings it will appear manifest that they are not necessary to the being of government but that laws may continue when there is no monarch  It is plain that there was law before we heard any thing of any ruler except God himself from hence it would appear that the existence of laws does not de∣pend upon any human regal authority and though that Kings should chance to die the laws if just will continue immortal if they are unjust they ought never to exist  ON THE NATIONAL SIN OF SUFFERING BAD GOVERNMENT  From  A Discourse  for the Fast on April th    Entitled  SINS OF THE NATION  THE vices of nations may be divided into those which relate to their own internal proceedings or to their relations with other states With regard to the first the causes for humiliation are various Many nations are guilty of the crime of permiting op∣pressive laws and bad governments to remain amongst them by which the poor are crushed and the lives of the innocent are laid at the mercy of wicked and arbitrary men This is a national sin of the deep∣est dye as it involves in it most others It is painful to reflect how many atrocious governments there are in the world and how little even they who enjoy good ones seem to understand their true nature We are apt to speak of the  happiness  of living under a mild government as if it were like the happiness of living under an indulgent climate and when we thank God for it we rank it with the blessings of the air and of the soil whereas we ought to thank God for the  wisdom  and  virtue  of living under a good govern∣ment for a good government is the first of national duties It is indeed a happiness and one which de∣mands our most grateful thanks to be born under one which spares us the trouble and hazard of changing of it but a people born under a good government will probably not die under one if they conceive of it as of an indolent and passive happiness to be left for its preservation to fortunate conjunctures and the float∣ing and variable chances of incalculable events our second duty is to  keep  it good  ON CIVIL LIBERTY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT  By  Richard Price D D F R S  FROM what has been said it is obvious that all Civil Government as far as it can be denomi∣nated  free  is the creature of the people It originates with them It is conducted under their direction and has in view nothing but their happiness All its different forms are no more than so many different modes in which they chuse to direct their affairs and to secure the quiet enjoyment of their rightsIn every free state every man is his own legislator All  taxes  are freegifts for public servicesAll  laws  are particular provisions or regulations established by COMMON CONSENT for gaining protection and safe∣ty And all  Magistrates  are trustees or deputies for carrying these regulations into execution  Liberty therefore is too imperfectly defined when it is said to be "a Government by LAWS and not by MEN" If the laws are made by one man or a junto of men in a state and not by COMMON CON∣SENT a government by them does not differ from slavery In this case it would be a contradiction in terms to say that the state governs itself  From hence it is obvious that  Civil Liberty  in the most perfect degree can be enjoyed only in small states where every member is capable of giving his suffrage in person and of being chosen into public offices When a state becomes so numerous or when the different parts of it are removed to such distances from one another as to render this impracticable a diminution of liberty necessarily arises There are however in these circumstances methods by which such near approaches may be made to perfect liberty as shall answer all the purposes of government and at the same time secure every right of human nature  Tho' all the members of a state should not be ca∣pable of giving their suffrages on public measures  in∣dividually  and  personally  they may do this by the ap∣pointment of  substitutes  or  representatives  They may entrust the powers of legislation subject to such re∣strictions as they shall think necessary with any num∣ber of  delegates  and whatever can be done by such delegates within the limits of their trust may be con∣sidered as done by the united voice and counsel of the communityIn this method a free government may be established in the largest state and it is con∣ceivable that by regulations of this kind any num∣ber of states might be subjected to a scheme of go∣vernment that would exclude the desolations of war and produce universal peace and order  Let us think here of what may be practicable in this way with respect to  Europe  in particularWhile it continues divided as it is at present into a great number of independent kingdoms whose interests are continually clashing it is impossible but that dis∣putes will often arise which must end in war and carnage It would be no remedy to this evil to make one of these states supreme over the rest and to give it an absolute plenitude of power to superintend and controul them This would be to subject all the states to the arbitrary discretion of one and to esta∣blish an ignominious slavery not possible to be long endured It would therefore be a remedy worse than the disease nor is it possible it should be ap∣proved by any mind that has not lost every idea of civil liberty On the contraryLet every state with respect to all its internal concerns be continued independent of all the rest and let a general con∣federacy be formed by the appointment of a SENATE consisting of representatives from all the different states Let this SENATE possess tbe power of ma∣naging all the  common  concerns of the united states and of judging and deciding between them as a common  arbiter  or  umpire  in all disputes having  at the same time under its direction the common force of the states to support its decisions In these circumstances each seperate state would be secure against the interference of foreign power in its private concerns and therefore would possess  liberty  and at the same time it would be secure against all op∣pression and insult from every neighbouring state Thus might the scattered force and abilities of a whole continent be gathered into one point all liti∣gations settled as they rose universal peace esta∣blished and nation prevented  from any more lifting up a sword against nation  THE NEW CONSTITUTION OF FRANCE  Continued from page    OF THE REPUBLIC  THE French Republic is one and indivisible  OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PEOPLE  The French People is distributed for the exer∣cise of its sovereignty into Primary Assemblies of Cantons  It is distributed for administration and for justice into Departments Districts and Municipalities  OF THE STATE OF CITIZENS  Every man born or domiciliated in France of the age of twentyone years complete  Every foreigner of the age of twentyone years com∣plete who has been domiciliated in France for one year  Lives in it by his labour or acquires a property  or marries a French woman or adopts a child or maintains an age  erson finally every foreigner who shall be judg  by the Legislative Body to have deserved well of humanity  Is admitted to the exercise of the rights of a French citizen  The exercise of the rights of a citizen is lost by naturalization in a foreign country  he accept∣ance of functions or favours flowing from a govern∣ment not popular by condemnation to punishments infamous or afflictive till recapacitation  The exercise of the rights of a Citizen is sus∣pended by the state of accusation by a judgment of contumacy as long as that judgment is not annulled  OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE  The sovereign people is the universality of French citizens  It nominates directly its Deputies  It delegates to Electors the choice of Admini∣strators of Public Arbitrators of Criminal Judges and Judges of Appeal  It deliberates on the laws  OF THE PRIMARY ASSEMBLIES  The Primary Assemblies are composed of the Citizens domiciliated for six months in each canton  They are composed of citizens at the least and at the most called to vote  They are constituted by the nomination of a President Secretaries and Scrutineers  Their police appertains to them  No person can appear in them armed  The elections are made by ballot or open vote at the option of each voter  A Primary Assembly cannot in any case pre∣scribe a uniform mode of voting  The Scrutineers ascertain the votes of citizens who cannot write and choose to vote by ballot  The suffrages upon laws are given by  yes  or by  no  The will of a Primary Assembly is proclaimed th    The citizens met in Primary Assembly of to the number of votes vote for or vote against by a majority of    OF THE NATIONAL REPRESENTATION  The population is the sole basis of the National Representation  There is one Deputy for every indi∣viduals  Each reunion of Primary Assemblies resulting from a population of from to souls nominates directly one Deputy  The nomination is made by the absolute majo∣rity of suffrages  Each Assembly casts up the suffrages and sends a Commissioner for the general casting up to the place pointed out as the most central  If the first casting up does not give an absolute majority a second vote is proceeded to and the votes are taken for the two citizens who had the most voices  In case of equality of voices the eldest has the preference either to be on the ballot or elected in case of equality of age lot decides  Every Frenchman exercising the rights of Citizen is eligible through the extent of the Republic  Each Deputy belongs to the whole nation  In case of the nonacceptance resignation for∣feiture or death of a Deputy he is replaced by the Primary Assemblies who nominated him  A Deputy who has given in his resignation cannot quit his post but after the admission of his successor  The French People assemble every year on the  of May for the elections  It proceeds in them whatever be the number of Citizens present having a right to vote  Primary Assemblies are formed on extraordi∣nary occasions on the demand of a fifth of the Citi∣zens who have a right to vote in them  The Convocation is made in this case by the Municipality of the ordinary place of meeting  These extraordinary Assemblies do not delibe∣rate but when one more than the half of the citizens who have a right to vote in them are present  OF ELECTORAL ASSEMBLIES  The Citizens met in Primary Assemblies no∣minate one Elector for every Citizens present or not two for from to and three for from to  The holding of the Electoral Assemblies and the mode of elections are the same as in the Primary Assemblies  OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY  The Legislative Body is one indivisible and permanent  Its session is for a year  It meets the st of July  The National Assembly cannot be constituted if it do not consist of one more than the half of the Deputies  The Deputies cannot be examined accused or tried at any time for the opinions they have delivered in the Legislative Body  They may for a criminal act be seized  en∣flagrant delite  but a warrant of arrest or a warrant summoning to appear cannot be granted against them unless authorised by the Legislative Body  HOLDING OF THE SITTINGS OF THE LE∣GISLATIVE BODY  The Sittings of the National Assembly are public  The minutes of its sittings are printed  It cannot deliberate if it be not composed of members at least  It cannot refuse to hear its members speak in the order in which they have demanded to be heard  It deliberates by the majority of the members present  Fifty members have a right to require the  ap∣peal nominal  It has the right of censure on the conduct of its members in its bosom  The police appertains to it in the place of its sittings and in the external circuit which it has de∣termined  OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE LEGISLA∣TIVE BODY  The Legislative Body proposes laws and passes decrees  Under the general name of laws are compre∣hended the acts of the Legislative Body concerning the Legislation civil and criminal the general admi∣nistration of the revenues and of the ordinary ex∣pences of the Republic the national domains the title the weight the impression and the denomination of money the nature the amount and the collection of contributions the declaration of war every new general distribution of the French territory the pub∣lic instruction the public honours to the memory of great men  Under the particular name of  Decrees  are in∣cluded the acts of the Legislative Body concerning the annual establishment of the land and sea forces the permission or the prohibition of the passage of foreign troops through the French territory the in∣troduction of foreign naval forces into the ports of the Republic the measures of general safety and tranquil∣lity the annual and momentary distribution of pub∣lic succours and works the orders for the fabrication of money of every kind the unforeseen and extraor∣dinary  expences the

chief of armies the prosecution of the responsibility of Members of the Council and the public fu  onaries the accusation of persons charged with plots against the general safety of the Republic all change in the partial distribution of the French territory National recompences  O  THE FORMATION OF THE LAW  The plans of law are preceded by a report  The discussion cannot be opened and the law cannot be provisionally resolved upon till days after the report  The plan is printed and sent to all the Com∣m  s of the Republic under this  e  Law pro∣posed  Forty days after the sending of the law pro∣posed if in more than one half of the Departments the renth of the Primary Assemblies of each have not objected to it the plan is accepted and becomes  law  If there be an objection the Legislative Body convokes the Primary Assemblies  OF THE ENTITLING OF LAWS AND DECREES  Laws decrees judgments and all public acts are entitled  In the name of the French People  the year of the French Republic  To be continued  POPULAR ASSEMBLIES UNDERSTAND ON∣LY THEIR OWN INTERESTS  From  Harrington's Oceana  A Popular Assembly has no mean but is either the wisest in nature or has no brains at all When affairs go upon no other than the public in∣terest  this having no other interest to follow nor eyes to see withal is the wisest council but such ways are destructive to a prince and they will have no nay The congregation of  Israel  when REHO∣BOAM would not hearken to their advice deposed him and we know what popular councils so soon as they came to sufficient power did in  England  If a prince put a popular council from this ward he does a great matter and to little purpose for they under∣stand nothing else but themselves Wherefore the Kings of  France  and of  Spain  have dissolved all such assemblies It is true where a prince is not strong enough to get money out of them but by their con∣sent they are necessary yet then they are not purely of advice and dispatch but share in the government and he cannot be meddling with their purses but they will be meddling with his laws The Senate is of sieter use for a prince and yet except he has the way of TIBERIUS but a ticklish piece as appears by MAXIMINUS who was destroyed by PUPIENUS and BALBINUS captains set up against him by this order To go to the root These things are not otherwise in prudence or choice than by direction of the ba∣lance where this is popular no remedy but the prince must be advised by the people which if the late king would have endured the monarchy might have subsisted somewhat longer but while the ba∣lance was Aristocratical as during the great estates of the nobility and the clergy we find not the people to have been great or wise counsellors In sum if a king governs by a popular council or a house of commons the throne will not stand long if he go∣verns by a senate or a house of lords let him never fear the throne but have a care of himself there is no third as I have said often enough but the Divan  ON RELIGION  MORNING CHRONICLE  Nov    A Few days after the Bishop of Paris and his Vicars had set the example of renouncing their clerical character a Cure from a village on the Banks of the Rhone followed by some of his parishioners with an offering of gold and silver saints chalices rich vestments c presented himself at the Bar of the National Convention The sight of the gold put the Convention in a very good humour and the Cur  a thin venerable looking man with grey hairs was ordered to speak I come said he from the village of where the only good building stand∣ing for the Chateau has been pulled down is a very fine church my parishioners beg you will take it to make an hospital for the sick and wounded of both parties they being both equally our country∣men the gold and silver part of which we have brought you they entreat you will devote to the ser∣vice of the state and that you will cast the bells into cannon to drive away its foreign invaders for my∣self I am come with great pleasure to resign my let∣ters of ordination of induction and every deed and title by which I have been constituted a member of your ecclesiastical polity Here are the papers you may burn them if you please in the same fire with the genealogical trees and patents of the nobility I desire likewise that you will discontinue my salary I am still able to support myself with the labour of my hands and I beg you to believe that I never felt sincerer joy than I now do in making this renunci∣ation I have longed to see this day I see it and am glad  When the old man had done speaking the ap∣plause were immoderate You are an honest man said they all at once a brave fellow and the Pre∣sident advanced to give him the fraternal embrace  The Curé did not seem greatly elated with these tokens of approbation and thus resumed his dis∣course"Before you applaud my sentiments it is fit you should understand them perhaps they may not entirely coincide with your own I rejoice in this day not because I wish to see religion degraded but because I wish to see it exalted and purisied By dissolving its alliance with the state you have given it dignity and independence You have done it a piece of service which  s wellwishers would perhaps ne∣ver have had courage to render it but which is the only thing wanted to make it appear in its genuine beauty and lustre Nobody will now say of me when I am performing the offices of my religion it is his trade he is paid for telling the people such and such things he is hired to keep up an useful piece of mum∣mery They cannot now say this and therefore I feel myself raised in my own esteem and shall speak to them with a confidence and frankness which be∣fore this I never durst venture to assume We re∣sign without reluctance our gold and silver images and embroidered vestments because we have never found that looking upon gold and silver made the heart more pure or the affections more heavenly we can also spare our churches for the heart that wishes to lift itself up to GOD will never be at a loss for room to do it in but we cannot spare oar reli∣gion because to tell you the truth we never had so much occasion for it I understand that you accuse us priests of having told the people a great many falshoods I suspect this may have been the case but till this day we have never been allowed to enquire whether the things which we taught them were true or not You required us formerly to receive them all without proof and you now would have us reject them all without discrimination neither of these modes of conduct become philosophers such as you would be thought to be I am going to employ myself diligently along with my parishioners to sift  the wheat from the bran the true from the false if we are not successful we shall be at least sincere  fear indeed that while I wore these vestments which we have brought you and spoke in that large gloomy building which we have given up to you I told my poor flock a great many idle stories I cannot but hope however that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material since the village has in general been sober and good the peasants are honest decile and laborious the husbands love their wives and the wives their husbands they are fortunately not too rich to be compassionate and they have con∣stantly relieved the sick and fugitives of all parties whenever it has lain in their way I think therefore what I have taught cannot be so very much amiss You want to extirpate pri  sts but will you hinder the ignorant from applying for instruction the un∣happy for comfort and hope the unlearned from looking up to the learned If you do not you will have priests by whatever name you may order them to be called but it is certa  ly not necessary they should wear a particular dress or be appointed by stare letters of ordination My letters of ordination are my zeal my charity my ardent love for my dear children of the village if I were more learned I would add my knowledge but alas we all know very little to man every error is pardonable but want of humility We have a public walk with a spreading elmtree at one end of it and a circle of green round it with a convenient bench Here I shall get together the children as they are playing around me I shall point to the vines laden with fruit to the orchards to the herds or cattle lowing around us to those distant hills stretching one behind another and they will ask me how came all these things I shall tell them all I know or have heard from wise men who have lived before me they will be penetrated with love and veneration they will kneel I shall kneel with them they will be at my  feet but all of us at the feet of that Good Being whom we shall worship together and thus they will receive within their tender minds a religion The old men will come sometimes from having deposited under the green sod one of their companions and place them∣selves by my side they will look wishfully at the turf and anxiously enquireis he gone for ever shall we soon be like him will no morning break over the tombWhen the wicked cease from troubling will the good cease from doing good We will talk of those things I will comfort them I will tell them of the goodness of God I will speak to them of a life to come I will bid them hope for a state of re∣tribution In a clear night when the stars slide over our heads they will ask what those bright bodies are and by what rules they rise and setand we will converse about different forms of being and distant worlds in the immensity of space governed by the same laws till we feel our minds raised from what is groveling and refined from what is sordid You talk of Nature this is Nature and if you could at this moment extinguish religion in the minds of all the world thus would it be rekindled again and thus again excite the curiosity and interest the feelings of mankind You have changed our holidays you have an undoubted right as our civil governors so to do it is very immaterial whether they are kept once in seven days or once in ten some however you will leave us and when they occur I shall tell those who chuse to hear me of the beauty and utility of virtue of the dignity of right conduct We shall talk of good men who have lived in the world and of the doctrines they taught and if any of them have been persecuted and put to death for their virtue we shall reverence their memories the moreI hope in all this there is no harm There is a book out of which I have sometimes taught my people it says we are to love those who do us hurt and to poor oil and wine into the wounds of the stranger It has  enabled my children to bear patiently the spoiling of their goods and to give up their own interest for the general walfare I think it cannot be a very bad book I wish more of it had been read in your town perhaps you would not have had quite so many assassinations and massacres In this book we hear of a person called JESUS some worship him as a God others as I am told say to it is wrong to do sosome teach that he existed before the beginning of ages others that he was born of JOSEPH and MARY I cannot tell whether these controversies will ever be decided but in the mean time I think we cannot do otherwise than well to imitate him for I learn that he loved the poor and went about doing good  FellowCitizens as I travelled hither from my own Village I saw peasants sitting amongst the smok∣ing ruins of their cottages rich men and women reduced to deplorable poverty Fathers lamenting their children in the bloom and pride of youth and I said to myself these people cannot afford to part with their religion But indeed you cannot take it away if contrary to your first declaration you chuse to try the experiment of persecuting it you will only make us prize it more and love it better Religion true of false is so necessary to the mind of man that even you have already begun to make yourselves a new one You are sowing the seeds of superstition at the moment you fancy you are destroy∣ing superstition Let every one chufe the religion that pleases him I and my parishioners are content with ours it teaches us to bear without despondency whatever evils may befal us  ON KINGS  From  Godwin  's Enquiry concerning Political Justice    Continued from page    LET us proceed to consider the moral effects which the institution of monarchical government is  tleulated to produce upon the inhabitants of the coun∣tries in which it flourishes And here it must be laid  wn as a first principle that monarchy is founded in imp  ture It is false that kings are entitled to the e  nee they obtain They possess no intrinsic supe∣riority over their subjects The line of distinction that is drawn is the offspring of pretence an indirect means employed for effecting certain purposes and not the offspring of truth It tramples upon the ge∣nuine nature of things and depends for its support upon this argument "that were it not for impositions of a similar nature mankind would be miserable"  Secondly it is false that kings can discharge the duties of royalty They pretend to superintend the affairs of millions and they are necessarily unacquaint∣ed with these affairs The senses of kings are con∣structed like those of other men they can neither see nor hear what is transacted in their absence They pretend to administer the affairs of millions and they possess no such supernatural powers as should enable them to act at a distance They are nothing of what they would persuade us to believe them The king is often ignorant of that of which half the inhabitants of his dominions are informed His prerogatives are administered by others and THE LOWEST CLERK IN OFFICE IS FREQUENTLY TO THIS AND THAT IN∣DIVIDUAL MORE EFFECTUALLY THE SOVEREIGN THAN THE KING HIMSELF He knows nothing of what is solemnly transacted in his name  To conduct this imposture with success it is neces∣sary to bring over to its party our eyes and our ears  Accordingly kings are always exhibited with all the splendour of ornament attendance and equipage They live amidst a sumptuousness of expence and this not merely to gratify their appetites but as a necessary instrument of policy  The most fatal opinion that could lay hold upon the minds of their subjects is that kings are but men  Accordingly they are care∣fully withdrawn from the profaneness of vulgar in∣spection and when they are exhibited it is with every artifice that may dazzle our sense and mislead out judgment  The imposture does not stop with our eyes but addresses itself to our ears Hence the inflated stile of regal formality  The  NAME OF KING  every where o  des it  lf upon us  It would seem as if every thing in the country the lands the houses the fur∣niture and the inhabitants were his property Our estates are the king's dominions Our bodies and minds are his subjects Our representatives are his parliament Our courts of law are his deputies All  gistrates throughout the realm are the king's of∣ficers His name occupies the formost place in all statutes and decrees He is the prosecutor of every criminal He is "Our Sovereign Lord the King" Were it possible that he should die "the fountain of our blood the means by which we live" would be gone every political function would be suspended It is therefore one of the fundamental principles of monarchical government that "the king cannot die" Our moral principles accommodate themselves to our veracity and accordingly the sum of our poli∣tical duties the most important of all duties is loy∣alty to be true and faithful to the king to honour a man whom it may be we ought to despise and to obey that is to acknowledge no immutable criteri∣on of justice and injustice  To be continued  KINGS ARE  GREAT  BLESSINGS  SOON as a Monarch mounts a throne  His usefulness is clearly known  As thousands can declare  The kingly trade he undertakes  And MANY  a little monarch makes  The government to share  And now in all the toils of state  He  thinks  and  labours  earlylate  And with an  anxious  mind  He presses on from care to care  The people's burthens  heavy  bear  Upon his  gracious  mind  He leaves the dissipated crew  Routs feasts and sporting to pursue  The Follies of the Day  Far greater thoughts his heart engage  Than concertshuntingor the stage  As wise Duguet doth say  The law he next surveys and sees  That acts and deeds and suits and fees  May not the poor oppress  Hence judges so UPRIGHT we see  And juries HONEST wise and FREE  Their purest thoughts express  Anon the Church his care demands  The holy troop with gowns and bands  He suffers none FOR HIRE  To feed and guide the poor and blind  To raise and cultivate the mind  Of each he doth require  Thus Kings are rais'd to bless a land  And Church and State go hand in hand  The blessing to ensure  Upon men's backs the Junto rides  So  soft  they sit upon their hides  'Tis  pleasant  to endure  ON THE HORRORS OF WAR  By  Dr JOHNSON  IT is wonderful with what coolness and indif∣ference the greater part of mankind see war com∣menced Those who hear of it at a distance or read of it in books but have never presented its evils to their minds consider it as little more than a splendid game a proclamation an army a battle and a tri∣umph Some indeed must perish in the most success∣ful field but they die upon the bed of honour  re∣sign their lives awidst the joys of conquest and filled with England's glory smile in death  The life of a modern soldier is ill represented by heroic fiction War has means of destruction more formidable than the cannon and the sword Of the thousands and ten thousands who perished in our late contests with France and Spain a very small part ever felt the stroke of an enemy the rest languished in tents and ships amidst damps and putrefaction pale torpid spiritless and helpless gasping and groaning unpitied among men made obdurate by a long con∣tinuance of hopeless misery and were at last whelmed in pits or heaved into the ocean without notice and without remembrance By incommodious en∣campments and unwholesome stations where courage is useless and enterprize impracticable fleets are silently dispeopled and armies sluggishly melted away  Thus is a people gradually exhausted for the most part with little effect The wars of civilized nations make very slow changes in the system of empire The public perceives scarcely any alteration but an en∣crease of debt and the few individuals who are be∣nefited are not supposed to have the clearest right to their advantages If he who shared the danger en∣joyed the profit and after bleeding in the battle grew rich by the victory he might shew his gains without  envy But at the conclusion of a ten years war how are we recompenced for the death of multitudes and the expence of millions but by contemplating the sudden glories of paymasters and agents contractors and commissuries whose equipages shine like meteors and whose palaces rise like exhalations  These are the men who without virtue labour or hazard are growing rich as their country is im∣poverished they rejoice when obstinacy or ambition add another year to slaughter and devastation and laugh from their desks at bravery and science while they are adding figure to figure and cipher to cipher hoping for a new contract from a new armament and computing the profits of a siege or a tempest    Continuation of Mr  ERSKINE's Defence of PAINE  and of  The Liberty of the Press  from page    THE Attorney General throughout the whole course of his address to you I knew it would be so has avoided the most distant notice or hint of any circumstance having led to the appearance of the Author in the political world after a silence of so many years he has not even pronounced or even glanced at the name of Mr Burke but has left you to take it for granted that the Defendant volunteered this delicate and momentous subject and that with∣out being led to it by the provocation of political controversy he had seized a favourable moment to stigmatize from mere malice and against his own confirmed opinions the constitution of this country  Gentlemen my learned friend knows too well my re∣spect and value for him to suppose that I am charging him with a wilful suppression I know him to be inca∣pable of it he knew it would come from me He will permit me however to lament that it should be  left for me at this late period of the cause to in∣form you that not only the Work before you but the First Part of which it is a natural continuation were written  avowedly and upon the face of them  IN ANSWER TO MR BURKE They were written besides under circumistances which I shall hereafter explain and in the course of which explanation I may have occasion to cite a few passages from the Works of that celebrated person And I shall speak of him with the highest respect for with whatever contempt he may delight to look down upon my hamble talents however he may disparage the prin∣ciples which direct my public conduct he shall never force me to forget the regard which this country owes to him for the Writings which he has left upon record for the illumination of our most distant poste∣rity After the gratitude which we owe to God for the divine gifts of reason and understanding our next thanks are due to those from the fountain of whose enlightened minds they are fed and fructified But pleading as I do the cause of freedom of opi∣nions I shall not give offence by remarking that this great Author has been thought to have changed some of his and if Thomas Paine had not thought so I should not now be addressing you because the Book which is my subject would never have been written Who is right and who is wrong in the contention of doctrines I have repeatedly disclaim∣ed to be the question I can only say that Mr Paine may be right throughout but that Mr Burke cannotMr Paine has been uniform in his opinions but Mr Burke has notMr Burke can only be right in part but should Mr Paine be even mis∣taken in the whole still I am not removed from the principle of his defence My defence has nothing to do with either the concealment or rectitude of his doctrines I admit Mr Paine to be a Republican you shall soon see what made him oneI do not seek to shade or qualify his attack upon our consti∣tution  I put my defence on no such matterhe un∣doubtedly means to declare it to be defective in its forms and contaminated with abuses which in his judgment will one day or other bring on the ruin of us all it is in vain to mince the matter this is the scope of his Work But still if it contains no attack upon the King's majesty nor upon any other  living  magistrate if it excites to no resistance to magistracy but on the contrary if it even in∣culeates as it does obedience to government then wherever may be its defects the question continues as before and ever must remain an unmixed question of THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS I therefore con∣sider it as no breach of professional duty nor in∣jurious to the cause I am defending to express my own admiration of the real principles of our consti∣tation a constitution which I hope never to see give way to any othera constitution which has been productive of various benefits and which will produce many more hereafter if we have wisdom enough to pluck up those weeds that grow in the richest soils and among the brightest flowers I agree with the merchants of London that the English government is equal to the reformation of its own abuses and as an inhabitant of the city I would have signed their declaration if I had known  of my own knowledge  the facts recited in its preamble But abuses the English constitution unquestionably has which call loudly for reformation the existence of which has been the theme of our greatest states∣men which have too plainly formed the principles of the Defendant and created the very conjecture which produced this Book  Gentlemen we all but too well remember the calamitous situation in which our country stood but a few years agoa situation which no man can look back upon without horror nor feel himfelf safe from relapsing into it again while the causes remain which produced it The event I allude to you must know to be the American war and the still  existing causes of it the corroption of this Govern∣ment In those days it was not thought virtue by the Patriots of England to conceal their existence from the people but them as now authority con∣demned them as disaffected subjects and deseated the end  they sought by their promulgation  Hear the opinion of Sir George Savillenot his speculative opinion concerning the structure of car government in the abstract but his opinion of the set∣tled abuses which prevailed in his own time and which continue at this moment But first let me re∣mind you who Sir George Saville wasI fear we s  all hardly look upon his like againHow shall I  scri  him to youIn my own words I cannot I was lately commended by Mr Burke in the House of Commons for strongthening my own language by an appeal to Dr Johnson Were the honourable gentleman present at this moment he would no doubt doubly applaud my choice in resorting to his own Works for the description of Sir George Saville  His fortune is among the largest a fortune which wholly unincumbered as it is without one single charge from luxury vanity or excess sinks under the benevolence of its dispenser This pri∣vate benevolence expending itself into patriotism renders his whole being the estate of the public in which he has not reserved a  peculium  for himself of profit diversion or relaxation During the session the first in and the last out of the House of Com∣mons he passes from the senate to the camp and seldom seeing the seat of his ancestors he is always in parliament to serve his country or in the field to defend it  It is impossible to ascribe to such a character any principal but patriotism when he expresses himself as follows  I return to you baffled and dispirited and I am sorry that truth obliges me to add with hardly a ray of hope of seeing any change in the miserable  course of public calamities On this melancholy d  of account in rence  ing up to you my trust I deliver to you your share of a country maimed and weakened  treasure lavished and mispent its honours faded and its conduct the laughingstock of Europe our nation in a manner without allies or friends except such as we have hired to destroy  r followsubjects and to ravage a coun∣try in which we once claimed an invaluable share I return to you some of your principal privileges impeached and mangled And lastly I leave you as I conceive at this hour and moment fully effec∣tually and absolutely under the discretion and power of a military force which is to act without waiting for the authority of the civil magistrates  Some have been accused of exaggerating the public misfortunes nay of having endeavoured to help forward the mischief that they might afterwards raise discontents I am willing to hope that neither my temper nor my si  ation in life will be thought naturally to urge me to promote misery discord or confusion or to exult in the subversion of order or in the ruin of property I have no reason to contemplate with pleasure the poverty of our country the increase of our debts and of our taxes or the decay of our commerceTrust not however to my report reflect compare and judge for yourselves  But under all these disheartening circumstances I could yet entertain a chearful hope and under∣take again the commission with alacrity as well as zeal if I could see any effectual steps taken to remove the original cause of the mischief Then would there be a hope  But till the purity of the constituent body and thereby that of the representation be restored there is NONE  I gladly embrace this most public opportunity of delivering my sentiments not only to all my  constituents but to those likewise not my consti∣tuents whom yet in the large sense I represent and am faithfully to serve  I look upon restoring election and representa∣tion in some degree for I expect no miracles to their original purity to be that without which all other efforts will be vain and ridiculous  If something be not done you may indeed re∣tain the outward form of your Constitution but not the power thereof  To be continued  ON THE AUTHORITY OF ONE COUNTRY OVER ANOTHER  By  Dr PRICE  FROM the nature and principles of Civil Liberty it is an immediate and necessary inference that no one community can have any power over the pro∣perty or legislation of another community that is not incorporated with it by a just and adequate re∣presentationThen only is a state  free  when it is governed by its own will But a country that is sub∣ject to the legislature of another country in which it has no voice and over which it has no controul can∣not be said to be governed by its own will Such a country therefore is in a state of slavery And it deserves to be particularly considered that such a slavery is worse on several accounts than any slavery of private men to one another or of kingdoms to despots within themselvesBetween one state and another there is none of that fellowfeeling that takes place between persons in private life Being detached bodies that never see one another and re∣siding perhaps in different quarters of the globe the  state that governs cannot be a witness to the suffer∣ings occasioned by its oppressions or a competent judge of the circumstances and abilities of the peo∣ple who are governed They must also have in a great degree separate interests and the more the one is loaded the more the other may be cased The infamy likewise of oppression being in such circum∣stances shared among a multitude is not likely to be much felt or regarded On all these accounts there is in the cafe of one country subjugated to another little or nothing to check rapacity and the most flagrant injustice and cruelty may be practised with∣out remorse or pity I will add that it is particu∣larly difficult to shake off a tyranny of this kind A single despot if a people are unanimous and reso∣lute may be soon subdued But a despotic state is not easily subdued and a people subject to it cannot eman∣cipate themselves without entering into a dreadful and perhaps very unequal contest  I cannot help observing farther that the slavery of a people to external despots may be qualified and li∣mited but I don't see what can limit the authority of one state over another The exercise of power in this case can have no other measure than discretion and therefore must be indefinite and absolute  Once more It should be considered that the go∣vernment of one country by another can only be sup∣ported by a military force and without such a sup∣port must be destitute of all weight and efficiency  A LESSON FOR DARING PUBLISHERS  The PROPRIETORS of the MORNING CHRONICLE were prosecuted and tried the th of  December  for publishing in their Paper the following ADDRESS and the Jury after a conscientious No XX  Struggle of  Fifteen Hours  returned a Verdict of NOT GUILTY It is therefore inserted in this Publication as a Specimen of what the FREE∣BORN SONS OF OLD ENGLAND may no longer publish with Safety  THE DERBY ADDRESS  At a Meeting of the Society for Political Information held at the Talbot Inn in Derby July th    the following Address declaratory of their Principles c was unanimously agreed to and ordered to be printed  To the Friends of Free Enquiry and the General Good  FELLOW CITIZENS  CLAIMING it as our indefeasible right to associate together in a peaceable and friendly manner for the communication of thoughts the formation of opi∣nions and to promote the general happiness we think it unnecessary to offer any apology for inviting you to join us in this manly and benevolent pursuit the ne∣cessity of the inhabitants of every community endea∣vouring to procure a true knowledge of their rights their duties and their Interests will not be denied except by those who are the slaves of prejudice or the interested in the continuation of abuses As men who wish to aspire to the title of Freemen we totally deny the wisdom and the humanity of the advice to approach the defects of government with "pious awe and trembling solicitude" What better doctrine could the Pope or the Tyrants of Europe desire We think therefore that the cause of truth and justice can never be hurt by temperate and honest discussions and that cause which will not bear such a scrutiny must be systematically or practically bad We are sensible that those who are not friends to the general  good have attempted to inflame the public mind with the cry of "Danger" whenever men have asso∣ciated for discussing the principles of government and we have little doubt but such conduct will be pur∣sued in this place we would therefore caution every honest man who has really the welfare of the nation at heart to avoid being led away by the prostituted clamours of those who live on the sources of corrup∣tion We pity the fears of the timorous and we are totally unconcerned respecting the false alarms of the venal We are in the pursuit of truth in a peace∣able calm and unbiassed manner and whereever we recognize her features we will embrace her as the companion of happiness of wisdom and of peace This is the mode of our conduct the reasons for it will be found in the following declaration of our opi∣nions to the whole of which each member gives his hearty assent  DECLARATION  I That all true Government is instituted for the general good is legalized by the general will and all its actions are or ought to be directed for the ge∣neral happiness and prosperity of all honest citizens  II That we feel too much not to believe that deep and alarming abuses exist in the British Govern∣ment yet we are at the same time fully sensible that our situation is comfortable compared with that of the people of many European kingdoms and that as the times are in some degree moderate they ought to be free from riot and confusion  III Yet we think there is sufficient cause to en∣quire into the necessity of the payment of seventeen millions of annual taxes exclusive of poor rates county rates expences of collection c c by seven mil∣lions of people we think that these expences may be reduced without lessening the true dignity of the nation or the government and therefore wish for satisfaction in this important matter  IV We view with concern the frequency of Wars We are persuaded that th  interests of the poor can never be promoted by accession of territory when bought at the expence of labour and blood and we must say in the language of a celebrated author"We who are only the people but who pay for wars with our substance and our blood will not cease to tell Kings or Governments that to them  lone wars are profitable that the true and just con  are those which each makes at home by co  ting the peasantry by promoting agricul∣ture and manufactories by multiplying men and the other productions of nature that then it is that Kings  themselves the image of God whose will is perpetually directed to the creation of new beings If they continue to make us fight and kill one another in uniform we will continue to write and speak until nations shall be cured of this folly" We are certain our present heavy burthens are owing in a great measure to cruel and impolitic wars and there∣fore we will do all on our part as peaceable citizens who have the good of the community at heart to enlighten each other and protest against them  V The present state of the representation of the People calls for the particular attention of every man who has humanity sufficient to feel for the ho∣nour and happiness of his country to the defects and corruptions of which we are inclined to attribute unne∣cessary Wars c c We think it a deplorable case when the poor must support a corruption which is calcu∣lated to oppress them when the labourer must give his money to afford the means of preventing him having a voice in its disposal when the lower classes may say "We give you our money for which we have toiled and sweat and which would save our families from cold and hunger but we think it more hard that there is nobody whom we have delegated to see that it is not improperly and wickedly sp  nt we have none to watch over our interests the rich only  are represented""The form of Government since the Revolution is in some respects changed for the worse by the triennial and septennial acts we lost annual Parliaments besides which the wholesome provision for obliging Privy Counsellors to subscribe their advice with their names and against Placemen and Pensioners sitting in Parliament have been repeal∣ed" It is said that the voice of the people is the constitutional controul of Parliament but what is this  t saving that the Representative  naturally in∣  d to support wrong measures an  that the peo∣  be constantly assembling to oblige them to do their duty An equal and uncorrupt representation would we are persuaded save us from heavy expences and deliver us from many oppressions we will there∣fore do our duty to procure this reform which appears to us of the u  ost importance  VI In short we see with the most lively concern an army of Placemen Pen  ners c fighting in the  of corruption and prejudice and spreading the  agio  far and widea large and highly expen∣sive military establishment though we have a well regulated militia the increase of all kinds of rob∣beries riots executions c though the nation pays taxes equal to the whole land rental of the kingdom in order to have its property protected and  ured  nd is also obliged to enter into separate associations against felonious deprelations A criminal code of law sanguine and inefficacious a civil code so vo∣lominods and mysterious as to puzzle the best under∣standings by which means justices denies to the poor on account of the expence attending the obtaining of it corporations under ministerial or party influence swallowing up the importance and  cting against the voice of the people pena  icted  those who accept of office without  in  to one vio∣  of their consciences a  the voice of  ry drowned in p  tion and the cla∣mours of the pensioned and interested and we view  with the most poignant sorrow a part of the people deluded by a cry of the Constitution and Church in danger fighting with the weapons of savages under the banners of prejudice against those who have their true interest at heartwe see with equal sensibility the present outcry against reforms and a cruel procla∣mation tending to cramp the liberty of the press and discredit the true friends of the people receiving the support of numbers of our countrymenwe see the continuation of oppressive game laws and destructive monopolieswe see the education and comfort of the poor neglected notwithsdanding the enormous weight of the poor r  we see burthe  multiplied the lower classes sinking into poverty disgrace and ex∣cesses and the means of these shocking abuses increased for the purposes of revenuefor the same end Excise Laws those badges and sources of oppression kept up and multipliedAnd when we cast our eyes on a people just formed in a free communit  without  ∣ing had time to grow rich under a Government by which justice is duly administered the poor taught and comforted properly protected taxes sew and easy and that at an expence as small as that of our pension liftwe ask ourselves"Are we in EnglandHave our forethers fought and bled and conquered  r libertyAnd did not they think that the fruits of their patriotism would be more abundant in pea  plenty and happinessAre we allways to stand still or go backwardsAre our burthens to be as heavy as the mo  enslaved peopleIs the condition o  the poor never to be improved" Great Britain must have arrived at the highest degree of national happi∣ness and prosperity and our situation must be too good to be mended or the present outcry against refer us and improvements is inhuman and criminal But we hope our condition will be speedily improved and to obtain so desirable a good is the object of our present Association an union founded on principles of  ere∣volence and humanity disclaiming all connection  with riot and disorder but firm in our purpose and warm in our affections for liberty  VII LastlyWe invite the friends of freedom throughout Great Britain to form similar Societies and to act with unanimity and firmness till the peo∣ple be too wise to be imposed upon and their influ∣ence in the government be commensurate with their dignity and importance  THEN SHALL WE BE FREE AND HAPPY  By Order of the Society S EYRE Chairman  ODE TO HUMAN KIND  From  Dodsley's Poems  IS

bodies can deliberate  OF NATIONAL CONVENTIONS  If in one more than the half of the Depart∣ments the tenth of the Primary Assemblies of each regularly formed demand the revision of the Consti∣tutional Act or the change of some of its articles the Legislative Body is bound to convoke all the Primary Assemblies of the Republic to know if there be ground fot a National Convention  The National Convention is formed in the same manner as the Legislatures and unites in itself their powers  It employs itself with respect to the Consti∣tution only on the objects which were the cause of its convocation  OF THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC WITH FOREIGN NATIONS  The French people is the friend and the na∣tural ally of every free people  It does not interfere in the government of

Secretaries  CAUTIONS  Against the natural Encroachments of Power  From CATO'S LETTERS  PEOPLE are ruined by their ignorance of Human Nature which ignorance leads them to credu∣lity and too great a confidence in particular men They fondly imagine that he who possessing a great deal by their favour owes them great gratitude and all good offices will therefore return their kindness But alas how often are they mistaken in their fa∣vourites and trustees who the more they have given them are often the more incited to take all and to return destruction for generous usage The common people generally think that  great  men have  great  minds and  scorn  base actions which judgment is so false that the basest and worst of all actions have been done by  great  men Perhaps they have not picked private pockets but they have done worse they have often disturbed deceived and pillaged the world And he who is capable of the highest mischief is ca∣pable of the meanest He who plunders a country of a million of money would in suitable circumstances steal a silver spoon and a conqueror who steals and pillages a kingdom would in an humbler fortune rifle a portmanteau or rob an orchard  Political jealousy therefore in the people is a necessary and laudable passion But in a chief magi∣strate a jealousy of his people is not so justifiable their ambition being only to preserve themselves whereas it is natural for Power to be striving to en∣large itself and to be encroaching upon those who have none The most laudable jealousy of a magi∣strate is to be jealous  for  his people which will shew that be loves them and has used them well But to be jealous  of  them would denote that he has evil designs against them and has used them ill The  people's jealousy tends to preserve Liberty and the prince's to destroy it  Venice  is a glorious instance of the former and so is  England  and all nations who have lost their Liberty are melancholy proofs of the latter  Power is naturally active vigilant and distrustful which qualities in it push it upon all means and expe∣dients to fortify itself and upon destroying all op∣position and even all seeds of opposition and make it restless as long as any thing stands in its way It would do what it pleases and have no check Now because Liberty  chastises  and  shortens  Power therefore Power would  extinguish  Liberty and consequently Liberty has  too much  cause to be exceeding jealous and  always  upon her defence Power has  many  ad∣vantages over her it has generally  numerous  guards  many  creatures and  much  treasure besides it has  more  craft and experience  less  honesty and innocence And whereas Power  can  and for the most part  does  subsist where Liberty is not Liberty cannot subsist without Power so that she has as it were the enemy always at her gates  Some have said that Magistrates being accountable to none but God ought to know no other restraint But this reasoning is as frivolous as it is wicked for no good man cares how many punishments and pe∣nalties lie in the way to an offence which he does not intend to commit A man who does not intend to commit murder is not sorry that murder is pu∣nished with death And as to wicked men their being accountable to God whom they do not fear is no security to us against their folly and malice and to say that we ought to have no security against them is to insult common sense and give the lie to the first law of nature that of selfpreservation Human reason says that there is no obedience no regard due to those rulers who govern by no rule but their lust Such men are  no  rulers they are outlaws who be∣ing at defiance with God and man are protected by  no law of God or of reason By what precept moral or divine are we forbid to kill a wolf or burn an infected ship Is it unlawful to prevent wickedness and misery and to resist the authors of them Are crimes sanctified by their greatness And is he who robs a country and murders ten thousand  less  a criminal than he who steals  single  guineas and takes away  single  lives Is there any sin in  preventing  and  restraining  or  resisting  the greatest sin that can be committed that of oppressing and destroying man∣kind by wholesale Sure there never were such open such shameless such  s  fish  impostors as the advo∣cates for lawless power It is a damnable sin to op∣press  them  yet it is a damnable sin to oppose them when  they  oppress orgain by the oppression of others When they are hurt themselves  ever so little  or but  think  themselves hurt they are the loudest  of all  men in their complaints and the most outrageous in their behaviour but when  others  are plundered oppressed and butchered complaints are  sedition  and to seek redress is damnation Is not  this  to be the authors of all wickedness and falsehood  To conclude Power without controul appertains to God alone and no man ought to be trusted with what no man is equal to In truth there are so many passions and inconsistencies and so much  selfishness  belonging to human nature that  we can scarce be too much upon our guard against each other  The only security which we can have that men will be honest is to make it their interest to be honest and the best defence which we can have against their being knaves is to make it terrible to them to be knaves As there are many men wicked in some stations who would be innocent in others  the best way is to make wickedness unsafe in any station  DEFINITION OF LOYALTY  By Mr  TOPLADY  Vicar of Broad Hembury Devon in his  Church of England Vindicated  page    Printed in    TRUE Loyalty extends to one's  country  as well as to the  prince  and to oppose tyranny is no  breach  of Loyalty but an essential  branch  of it Loyalty as the very

law prohibiting patricians and plebeians from inter∣marrying may be repealed In support of this de∣mand Canulcius one of the tribunes of the people thus delivered himself  "What an insult upon us is this If we are not so rich as the patricians are we not citizens of Rome as well as they Inhabitants of the same country Members of the same community The nations bor∣dering upon Rome and even strangers more remote are admitted not only to marriages with us but to what is of much greater importance the freedom of the city Are we because we are commoners to be worse treated than strangers And when we de∣mand that the people may be free to bestow their of∣fices and dignities on whom they please do we ask any thing unreasonable or new Do we claim more than their original inherent rights What occasion then for all this uproar as if the universe was fail∣ing to ruin They were just going to lay viole  hands upon me in the senatehouse What must this empire then be unavoidably overturned must Rome of necessity sink at once if a plebeian worthy of the office should be raised to the consulship The partricians I am persuaded if they could would de∣prive you of the common light It certainly offends them that you breathe that you speak that you have the shapes of men Nay to make a commoner a consul would be say they a most enormous thing Numa Pompiliu  however without being so much as a Roman citizen was made king of Rome The elder Tarquin by birth not even an Italian was ne∣vertheless placed upon the throne Servius Tullius the son of a captive woman nobody knows who  his father was obtained the kingdom as the reward of his wisdom and virtue In those days no man in whom virtue shone conspicuous was rejected or de∣spised on account of his race or descent And did the state prosper the worse for that Were not these strangers the very best of our kings And supposing now that a plebeian should have their talents and me∣rit must not he be suffered to govern us Must we rather chuse such governors as the decemvirs Those excellent magistrates I think were mostly patrici∣ans But we find that upon the abolition of the regal power no commoner was chose to the consu∣late And what of that Before Numa's time there were no pontifices in Rome Before Servius Tullus's days there was no census no division of the people into clases and centuries Whoever heard of consuls before the expulsion of Tarquin the proud Dic∣tators we all know are of modern invention and so are the offices of tribunes  diles questors Within these ten years we have made decemvirs and we have unmade them Is nothing to be done but what has been done before That very law forbid∣ding marriages of patricians with plebeians is not that a new thing Was there any such law before the decemvirs enacted it And a most shameful one it is in a free state Such marriages it seems would taint the pure blood of the nobility Why if they think so let them take care to match their sisters and daughters with men of their own sort No plebeian will do violence to the daughter of a patrician Those are exploits for our prime nobles There is no need to sear that we shall force any body into a con∣tract of marriage But to make an express law to prohibit marriages of patricians with plebeians what is this but to shew the utmost contempt of us and to declare one part of the community to be impure and unclean Why don't they lay their wise heads to∣gether to hinder rich folks from matching with poor They talk to us of the confusion there will be  in families if this statute should be repealed I won∣der they do not make a law against a commoner's living near a nobleman or going the same road that he is going or being at the same feast or appearing at the same marketplace They might as well pre∣tend that these things make confusion in families as that intermarriages will do it Do not every one know that the child will be ranked according to the quality of his father let him be patrician or plebeian In short it is manifest enough that we have nothing in view but to be treated as men and Citizens nor can they who oppose our demand have any motive to do it but the love of domineering I would fain know of you consuls and patricians is the sovereign power in the people of Rome or in you I hope you will allow that the people can at their pleasure either make a law or repeal one And will you then as soon as any law is proposed to them pre∣tend to list them for the war and hinder them from giving their suffrages by leading them into the field Hear me consuls Whether the news of the war you talk of be true or whether it be only a false rumour spread abroad for nothing but a colour to send the people out of the city I declare as a tribune that this people who have already so often spilt their blood in our contry's cause are again ready to arm for its defence and its glory if they be restored to their natural rights and you will no longer treat us like strangers in our own country But if you account us unworthy of your alliance by intermarriages if you will not suffer the entrance to the chief offices in the state to be open to all persons of merit indifferently but will confine your chief ingistrates to the senate alone talk of wars as much as ever you please paint in your ordinary dis∣courses the league and power of our enemies ten times more dreadful than you do now I declare that this people whom you so much despise and to whom you are nevertheless indebted for all your  victories shall never more enlist themselves not a man of them shall take arms nor a man of them shall expose his life for imperious lords with whom he can neither share the dignities of the state nor in private life have any alliance by marriage"  You have seen by the foregoing speeches the pro∣gress of the struggles between the patricians and the plebeians which continued for many years the people always encroaching more and more upon the privileges of the patricians till at length all the great offices of the state became equally common to the one and to the other The following speech which was spoken above an hundred years after the foregoing one may serve as an instance and a proof of that great simplicity of manners public virtue and noble spirit which raised that people to that height of power and dominion which they after∣wards attained The occasion of it was this The Tarantines having a quarrel with the Romans in∣vite Pyrrhus king of Epirus to their assistance who lands with his forces in Italy and defeats the Roman army under the command of Laevinius Af∣ter this battle Fabritius with two other Roman senators is sent to Tarentum to treat with Pyrrhus about the exchange of prisoners The king being informed of the great abilities and great poverty of Fabritius hinted in a private conversation with him the unsuitableness of such poverty to such distin∣guished merit and that if he would assist him to ne∣gociate with the Romans an honourable peace for the Tarentines and go with him to Epirus he would bestow such riches upon him as should put him at least upon an equality with the most opulent nobles of Rome The answer of Fabritius was to this effect  "As to my poverty you have indeed Sir been rightly informed My whole estate consists in a house of but mean appearance and a little spot of ground from which by my own labour I draw my  support But if by any means you have been per∣sunded to think that this poverty makes me less con∣sidered in my own country or in any degree unhappy you are extremely deceived I have no reason to complain of fortune she supplies me with all that na∣ture requires and if I am without supersluities I am also free from the desire of them With these I con∣fess I should be more able to succour the necessitous the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied but as my possessions are I can still contri∣bute something to the support of the state and the assistance of my friends With regard to honours my country places me poor as I am upon a level with the richest For Rome knows no qualifications for great employments but virtue and ability She appoints me to officiate in the most august ceremonies of religion she entrusts me with the command of her armies she consides to my care the most important negotiations My poverty does not leslen the weight and influence of my counsels in the senate the Roman people honour me for that very poverty which you consider as a disgrace they know the many oppor∣tunities I have had in war to enrich myself without incurring censure they are convinced of my interested zeal for their prosperity and if I have any thing to complain of in the return they make it is only in the excess of their applause What value then can I set upon your gold and silver What king can add any thing to my fortune Always attentive to discharge the duties incumbent on me I have a mind free from selfreproach and I have an honest fame"  THE MARRIAGE ACT CENSURED  From  The Citizen of the World  By Goldsmith  NOT far from this City lives a poor Tinker who has educated seven sons all at this time in arms and fighting for their country and what reward do you think has the tinker from the state for such im∣portant services none in the world his sons when the war is over may probably be whipt from parish to parish as vagabonds and the old man when past la∣bour may die a prisoner in some house of correc∣tion  Such a worthy subject in China would be held in universal reverence his services would be rewarded if not with dignities at least with an exemption from labour he would take the left hand at seasts and mandarines themselves would be proud to shew their submission The English laws punish vice the Chinese laws do more they reward virtue  Considering the little encouragements given to ma∣trimony here I am not surprised at the discourage∣ments given to propagation Would you believe it my dear Fum Hoam there are laws made which even forbid the people's marrying each other By the head of Confucius I jest not there are such laws in being here and their lawgivers have neither been instructed among the Hottentots nor imbibed their principles of equity from the natives of Anamaboo  There are laws which ordain that no man shall marry a woman contrary to her own consent This though contrary to what we are taught in Asia and though in some measure a clog upon matrimony I have no great objection to There are laws which ordain that no woman shall marry against her father and mother's consent unless arrived at an age of ma∣turity by which is understood those years when woman with us are generally past childbearing Thi  must be a clog upon matrimony as it is more difficult for the lover to please three than one and much more difficult to please old people than young ones The laws ordain that the consenting couple shall take a long time to consider before they marry this is a very great clog because people love to have all rash actions done in a hurry It is ordained that all mar∣riages shall be proclaimed before celebration this is a severe clog as many are ashamed to have their mar∣riage made public from motives of vicious modesty and many afraid from views of temporal interest  It is ordained that there is nothing sacred in the ceremony but that it may be dissolved to all intents and purposes by the authority of any civil magistrate And yet opposite to this it is ordained that the priest shall be paid a large sum of money for granting his sacred permission  Thus you see my friend that matrimony here is hedged round with so many obstructions that those who are willing to break through or surmount them must be contented if at last they find it a bed of thorns The laws are not to blame for they have deterred the people from engaging as much as they could It is indeed become a very serious affair in England and none but serious people are generally found willing to engage The young the gay and the beautiful who have motives of passion only to induce them are seldom found to embark as those inducements are taken away and none but the old the ugly and the mercenary are seen to unite who if they have any posterity at all will probably be an ill favoured race like themselves  What gave rise to those laws might have been some such accidents as these It sometimes happened that a miser who had spent all his youth in seraping up money to give his daughter such a fortune as might get her a mandarine husband found his expectations disappointed at last by her running away with his footman this must have been a sad shock to the poor  disconsolate parent to see his poor daughter in a one∣horse chaise when he had designed her for a coach and six what a stroke from providence to see his dear money go to a beggar all nature cried out at the profanation  It sometimes happened also that a lady who had inherited all the titles and all the nervous complaints of nobility thought fit to impair her dignity and mend her constitution by marrying a farmer this must have been a sad shock to her inconsolable rela∣tions to see so fine a flower snatched from a flourish∣ing family and planted in a dunghill this was an absolute inversion of the first principles of things  In order therefore to prevent the great from be∣ing thus contaminated by vulgar alliances the obsta∣cles to matrimony have been so contrived that the rich only can marry amongst the rich and the poor who would leave celebacy must be content to increase their poverty with a wife Thus have the laws fairly inverted the inducements to matrimony nature tells us that beauty is the proper allurement of those who are rich and money of those who are poor but things here are so contrived that the rich are invited to marry by that fortune which they do not want and the poor have no inducement but that beauty which they do not feel  An equal diffusion of riches through any country constitutes its happiness Great wealth in the posses∣sion of one stagnates and extream poverty with ano∣ther keeps him in unambitious indigence but the moderately rich are generally active not too far removed from poverty to fear its calamities nor too near extreme wealth to slacken the nerve of labour they remain still between both in a state of continual fluctuation How impolitic therefore are those laws which promote the accumulation of wealth among the rich more impolitic still in at∣tempting to encrease the depression on poverty  Bacon the English Philosopher compares money  to manure if gathered in heaps says he it does no good on the contrary it becomes offensive but being spread though never so thinly over the sur∣face of the earth it enriches the whole country Thus the wealth a nation possesses must expatiate or it is of no benefit to the public it becomes rather a grievance where matrimonial laws thus consine it to a few  But this restraint upon matrimonial community even considered in a physical light is injurious As those who rear up animals take all possible pains to cross the strain in order to improve the breed so in those countries where marriage is most free the inhabitants are found every age to improve in stature and in beauty on the contrary where it is confined to a cast a tribe or an hord as among the Gaurs the Jews or the Tartars each division soon assumes a family likeness and every tribe degenerates into peculiar deformity From hence it may be easily in∣ferred that if the Mandarines here are resolved only to marry among each other they will soon produce a posterity with Mandarine Faces and we shall see the heir of some honourable family scaree equal to the abortion of a country farmer  These are a few of the obstacles to marriage here and it is certain they have in some measure answered the end for celebacy is both frequent and fashion∣able Old batchelors appear abroad without a mask and old maids my dear Fum Hoam have been abso∣lutely known to ogle To confess in friendship if I were an Englishman I fancy I should be an old batchelor myself I should never find courage to run through all the adventures prescribed by the law I could submit to court my mistress herself upon reasonable terms but to court her father her mother and a long tribe of cousins aunts and relations and then stand the butt of a whole country church I would as soon turn tail and make love to her grand∣mother  I can conceive no other reason for thus loading matrimony with so many prohibitions unless it be that the country was thought already too populous and this was found to be the most effectual means of thinning it If this was the motive I cannot but congratulate the wise projectors on the success of their scheme Hail O ye dimsighted politicians ye weeders of men 'Tis yours to clip the wing of industry and convert hymen to a broker 'Tis yours to behold small objects with a microscopic eye but to be blind to those which require an extent of vision 'Tis yours O ye discerners of mankind to lay the line between society and weaken that force by dividing which should bind with united vigour 'Tis yours to introduce national real distress in order to avoid the imaginary distresses of a few Your actions can be justified by an hundred reasons like truth they can be opposed but by few reasons and those reasons are true Fare∣well  I also will shew mine opinion  JOB xxxii ver  THE RIGHTS OF MAN BY QUESTION AND ANSWER  Q WHAT is Man  A An irrational unsocial cowardly and covetous animal  Q How do you prove he is irrational  A His actions are as much influenced by present passions and interests as are the actions of other ani∣mals deemed irrational  Q How is it that he is unsocial  A His ridiculous pride makes him imagine him∣self in an infinite variety of ways superior to others of his species and of course too noble for every company  Q Give some instances  A Some prefer themselves for being born of pa∣rents in this or that station or in some particular country or for being more tall handsome c and therefore refuse to associate with their supposed in∣feriors in these respects excepting to serve some sinister purpose nor will they allow those despised people equal privileges  Q How do you make it appear that man is a cowardly animal  A Because he hunts in packs like hounds the most cowardly of all dogs He seldom attacks singly either his own or any other species without manifest superiority of situation or arms When a company of them make a booty they do not all boldly fall on to partake each according to what his hunger or necessity requires but sneakingly keep at a distance till the strongest or most presumptuous think proper to allow them to partake  Q Do the herds or companies of other animals be∣have in the same timid manner to certain individuals among them  A By no means they are not half so complaisant A company of hounds or wolves will partake equally of their prey or else they will fight for it and wage eternal war till they gain their rights A hungry beast will attempt again and again whereas men have been frequently known to starve rather than help themselves to the common provisions of nature monopolized by their arrogant fellowcreatures  Q Do we not frequently see a striking difference in sleekness and fatness among a herd of cattle feed∣ing together in the same pasture owing to the pre∣sumption of some of them driving away the weaker animals from their victuals  A No None of them will submit to suffer thus far by others The most voracious and mischievous will only fill his own belly And while he is sight∣ing and driving off one another will have the as∣surance to come in for a share and thus either by force or stealth they are sure to partake pretty equally  Q Are not droves of hogs frequently seen passing through London of different appearance among them∣selves some being hardly able to walk with fat while others are like greyhounds for thinness  A No never Swine living together are all alike either all fat or all lean  Q Are mankind living in the same neighbour∣hood all of the same liking too  A No very far from it Some are like to hurst with fat and saticty while others appear like shadows and frequently die of want and dis∣eases flowing from scarcity or unwholsome diet  Q Did not Edmund Burke then very improperly term his starving fellowcreatures the Swinish Multi∣tude  A Yes he therein blundered most egregiously For on very flight observation he would find real Swine to be more noble animals and far from being so obsequeous They will not quietly suffer want on any account much less by the encroachments of their fellowcreatures If any great hog offer to thrust them from the trough they will scream most sedi∣tiously and will without regard to consequence in∣sist on having their noses in on one side or the other Besides if men were like swine how would they be drilled into soldiers Could an army of hogs be disciplined and marched against another army of hogs No they are not so fond of armour and trapping as to dance in them to their destruction They leave such stupid bravery to the rational be∣ing called Man They do not understand slaying each other for masters They only know bravery in  persisting in what they think tends to their own happiness and that they will most obstinately do Mr Burke must think of some other name for his filly brethren for they will never have the sense or spirit to defend their Rights and Interests like Swine Thus much for the cowardliness of mankind above other animals  Q Have men no other way of shewing their pe∣culiar meanness than by tamely giving up their Rights to the first usurper  A Yes By insulting decrepid individuals or small numbers of their own species when they are in company with other malicious beings like them∣selves But this they never venture upon except emboldened by their numbers No single man could ever yet venture to be insolent or witty upon another without his own companions As observed before they are like houndsthey always hunt in packs  Q How does it appear that men are covetous animals  A Nay they are so much so that this passion seems to be the source of all their other bad quali∣ties Other animals only covet till their present ap∣petite is satisfied and then leave the world in peace to others But man is insatiable He is like the grave he never saith he hath enough  Q Does his covetousness induce him to take things not absolutely necessary to life from his species by force  A Yes for the sake of mere superfluities to hoard up and which are of no manner of use but to look at he will destroy his fellow creatures in num∣bers to the utmost of his power  Q He is a vicious dangerous and detestable animal Does he ever compel others of the species to toil for him in procuring him food and raiment and those superfluous articles which he covets  A Does he aye He was not long in the world  till he reduced his fellows to slavery He continues to do so still and while the world lasts he will con∣tinue such injustice if the species do not acquire more spirit to resist the usurpations of each other If there is not universal and individual spirit to resist universal and individual presumption and covetous∣ness a great portion of men must always be in sub∣jection to the assuming few For mankind are not very likely to relinquish their injustice and avarice  Q What pity that they are not rational For then might this universal injustice and covetousness spur them on to invent some preventative against their common encroachments on the rights and properties of each other  A Certainly A small portion of reason might suffice for that purpose  Q What are the specific rights of the animal called Man  A Though the species by their inconsistent be∣haviour to each other may raise doubts concerning their rationality yet by their superior form of body and inventive powers of mind they seem qualified to turn all nature to their advantage and may not im∣properly be termed the Lords of the Creation And the Psalmist Psal viii ver says  God has made man but a little lower than the angels and crowned him with glory and honour Has made him to have do∣minion over the works of his hands and has put all things under his feet All sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea  Again in Psal cxv ver it is said  The Heaven even the Heavens are the Lord's  BUT THE EARTH HATH HE GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN  Q If then the earth be given to the children of men what pity it is that they cannot agree on some equitable mode of enjoying their common property and be content to live and let live like other crea∣tures  A Nothing seems more easy than to devise such a mode were men honest enough to be content with equality of rights and privileges  Q Whether such a plan may or may not be adopted it ought to be presented to them and then they will be left without excuse  A There is no more requisite to render mankind as happy as they can be on earth than simply this That the people in every district or parish should appoint collectors to receive the rents and divide them equally among themselves or apply them to what public uses they may think proper  Q Can any tyranny or abuses flow from such a principle  A No none can exist where such a principle is adhered to  Q Ought every one to pay rent to those col∣lectors  A Every one should pay according to the full value of the premises which he occupied whether farm house or apartment  Q How would the value of those tenements be known  A By letting them by public auction to the best bidder  Q For how long a term would the public pro∣bably let their tenements  A For the life of the occupier if he so long make good his payments that he might enjoy the fruits of any improvements he might make during his re∣sidence  Q But what if an occupier or tenant should not make good his payments  A Then the parish agents would let the premises by public auction to the best bidder that the people might receive no damage  Q Who would build and repair the houses c  A The parish agents who would have to state the accounts of these and all other expences to the peo∣ple by whose orders alone they could act  Q Would such a people pay taxes as usual for sup∣port of the state or would they supply the state immediately out of the parish rents  A That they might do as they chose If they wished not to be shackled by revenue laws or pestered by excisemen and informers they would probably pay the state a sum of money as their quota at once and have done with it  Q Would such a people build bridges make roads or rather public works with their money  A They might if they would  LESSONS FOR PIG EATERS  LESSON I  From the General Epistle of James Chap  ii  ver    DO not  rich  men  oppress  you and draw you be∣fore the  Judgment Seats  LESSON  From Ditto chap  v  ver    Go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries  that shall come upon you  Your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten Your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days Behold the  hire  of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud  crieth  and the  cries

the CELTIC SLAVE or SCALLAG in some of the HEBRIDES  From  Travels in the Western Hebrides  by the Rev  JOHN LANE BUCHANAN    Continued from page    st With regard to the respective conditions of their life in general it is in neither case of their own chusing The African is bereft of his freedom and sold into slavery by fraud and violence The Hebre∣dian Slave is indeed neither trapanned into slavery by guile nor compelled by physical compulsion but he is drawn into it by a moral necessity equally in∣vincible  by a train of circumstances which are be∣yond his power to controul and which leave him no option but either to serve some  master  as a Scallag or to protract a miserable existence for some time in the forest and near the uninhabited sea shores where he may pick up some shell fish to perish at last with his wife perhaps and little ones with cold and hunger  dly With regard to labour The Negro ge∣nerally works only from six o'clock in the morning to six in the evening and out of that time he has two complete hours for rest and refreshment The Scallag is at work from four o'clock in the morning to eight nine and sometimes ten at night  dly With regard to respite from labour The Negro is allowed two days in the week for himself so is the Scallag but the precepts of  Religion  allow the Scallag only one of these days to labour for his own maintenance  thly With regard to food The Negro has a plentiful allowance of such common fare as is sufficient for his support besides his little spot of land which he cultivates for himself on Saturday and Sunday as well as in the evenings after he has finished his mas∣ter's work The Scallag when at hard labour for his master is fed twice a day with watergruel or  brochan  as it is called or kail or coleworts with the addition of a barley cake or potatoes and all this without salt But for his family and for him∣self on Sundays or when he is unable to work through bodily indisposition he has no other means of sub∣sistence than what he can raise for himself by the labour of one day out of seven from a scanty por∣tion of cold and moorish soilbarley potatoes cole∣worts and perhaps a milch cow or a couple of ewes for giving milk to his infants though if often hap∣pens that he is obliged to kill these  household gods  as it were to prevent his family from starving At certain seasons he has fish in abundance but this he  is for the most part obliged to eat without bread and often without salt The Negro if he be tole∣rably industrious can afford on Saturdays and other holidays with pepperpot a pig or a turkey and a cann of grog nay Negroes have been known to clear besides many comforts for their own family twenty thirty even forty pounds a year so that there is a fair probability that a Negro may be ena∣bled to gain the price of his liberty But of relief from bondage and woe the Scallag has not a single ray of hope on this side the grave  thly With regard to lodging and cloathing The Negro is comfortably lodged in a warm climate The Scallag is very poorly cloathed and still more wretchedly lodged in a cold one And as the Ne∣gro is provided by his master with bedding and body clothes so he is also furnished by him with the implements of husbandry The Scallag with sticks and sods rears his own miserable hut procures for him∣self a few rags either by what little flax or wool he can raise or by the refuse or coarser part of these furnished by his master and provides his own work∣ing tools as the spade c  thly With regard to usage or treatment The Slave is driven on to labour by stripes so also is the Scallag who is ever on some occasions formally tied up as well as the Negro to a stake and scourged on the bare back The owner of the Slave it may be farther observed has a strong interest in his welfare for if he should become sick or infirm the master must maintain him or if he should die the master must supply his place at a considerable expence There is no such restraint on the peevish humours or angry passions of a Hebredian laird or tacksman The Scallag under infirmity disease and old age is set adrift on the wide world and begs his bread from door to door and from island to island Nor is it necessary in order to supply the place of a Scallag to be at any expence for the frequent failure of  settlments affords but too many recruits to the wretch∣ed otder of Scallags  thly As there is nothing so natural as the love of liberty and an aversion to restraint and oppression the Scallag as well as the Negro sometimes attempts emancipation by fleeing to the uninhabited parts of the country though such attemps are not so of∣ten made by the Scallags after they are enured to slavery as when they feel themselves on the verge of sinking into that dreadful and deserted condition of existence  The only asylum for the distressed in the Long Island is the King's Forest where several are shel∣tered with their families and cattle for the summer season where they live in caves and dens of the earth and subsist without fire on milk the roots of the earth and shell fish But in the winter sea∣son cold and famine drive them back again to seek for subsistence and shelter under the same tyranny that had driven them to the forest The Blue or other mountains afford the means of life to runawaynegroes if they can escape the search of their mas∣ters both summer and winter  In the West Indies no planter or captain of a vessel is allowed by the law of the Colonies to kidnap con∣ceal or keep any runaway slave or by any means to detain him from his master Here also the compari∣son holds between the Slave and the Scallag There is not a takcsman who will take or retain in his ser∣vice or on his land either the Scallag or subte∣nant of another master without a written certificate from that master that the Scallag or subtenant has a good character and also if he be otherwise satisfied as to the character of the poor man that his master is willing to part with him For as the Colonists by their laws so the Tacksmen of the Hebrides by their country regulations have entered into a firm compact that no one shall harbour the subtenant or Scallag of another who does not produce a proof  of his humble and unlimited obedience to his former master And it is evident from reason were it not proved by experience that certificates are most with∣held when they are most wanted For no landlord who is known to be cruel to his people will ever give them certificates because in that case they would all leave the tyrant and seek for milder treat∣ment under some less severe master  GENERAL POLITICAL APHORISMS OR MAXIMS  From  HARRINGTON'S WORKS  THE errors and sufferings of the people are from their governors  The people cannot see but they can feel  Where the security is no more than personal there may be a good monarch but can be no good com∣monwealth  Where the security is in the persons the govern∣ment makes good men evil where the security is in form the government makes evil men good  Assemblies legitimately elected by the people are that only party which can govern without an army  Not the party which cannot govern without an army but the party which can govern without an army is the refined party as to this intent and pur∣pose truly refined that is by popular election ac∣cording to the precept of Moses and the rule of Scripture  take ye wise men and understanding and known among your tribes and I will make them rulers over you  The people are deceived by names but not by things  Where there is a well ordered commonwealth the people are generally satisfied  Where the people are generally dissatisfied there is no commonwealth  Where civil liberty is entire it includes liberty of conscience  Where liberty of conscience is entire it includes civil liberty  Either liberty of conscience can have no security at all or under popular government it must have the greatest security  To hold that a government may be introduced by a little at once is to wave prudence and commit things to chance  Government is of human prudence and human prudence is adequate to man's nature  Where the government is not adequate to man's nature it can never be quiet or perfect  A King governing now in  England  by an army would for the same causes find the same effects with the late protector  A king governing now in  England  by parliaments would find the nobility of no effect at all  A parliament where the nobility is of no effect at all is a mere popular council  A mere popular council will never receive law from a king  A mere popular council giving law to a king be∣comes thereby a democracy or equal commonwealth or the difference is no greater than the imperfection of the form  A commonwealth or democracy to be perfect in the form must consist especially of such an assembly the result whereof can go upon no interest whatsoever but that only which is the common interest of the whole people  An assembly consisting of a few may go upon the interest of one man as a king or upon the interest of one party as that of divines lawyers and the like or the interest of themselves and the perpetu∣ation of their government  The popular assembly in a commonwealth may consist of too few but can never consist of too many  To make principles or fundamentals belongs not to men to nations nor to human laws  To build upon such principles or fundamentals as are apparently laid by God in the inevitable necessity or law of nature is that which truly appertains to men to nations and to human laws To make any other fundamentals and then build upon them is to build castles in the air  Whatever is violent is not secure not durable whatever is secure or durable is natural  Government in the whole people though the ma∣jor part were disaffected must be secure or durable because it waves force to found itself upon nature  Government in a party though all of these were well affected must be insecure and transitory because it waves nature to found itself upon force  Commonwealths of all other governments are more especially for the preservation not for the de∣struction of mankind  THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE OF DEPEN∣DENCE ON THE MIND  From  The Citizen of the World  by Dr Goldsmith  AMONG many who have enforced the duty of Giving I am surprized there are none to incul∣cate the ignominy of Receiving to shew that by every favour we accept we in some measure forfeit our native freedom and that in a state of continual de∣pendence on the generosity of others in a life of gra∣dual debasement  Were men taught to despise the receiving obliga∣tions with the same force of reasoning and declama∣tion that they are instructed to confer them we might  then see every person in society filling up the requi∣site duties of his situation with chearful industry neither relaxed by hope nor sullen from disappoint∣ment  Every favour a man receives in some measure sinks him below his dignity and in proportion to the value of the benefit or the frequency of its ac∣ceptance he gives up so much of his natural inde∣pendence He therefore who thrives upon the un∣merited bounty of another if he has any sensibility suffers the worst of servitude the shackled slave may murmur with out reproach but the humble dependent is taxed with ingratitude upon every symptom of dis∣content the one may rave round the walls of his cell but the other lingers in all the silence of mental confinement To encrease his distress every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vigorous mind from rising till at last elastic no longer it shapes itself to constraint and puts on ha∣bitual servility  It is thus with the feeling mind but there are some who born without any share of sensibility receive favour after favour and still cringe for more who accept the offer of generosity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit and even make thanks for past benefits an indirect petition for new such I grant can suffer no debasement from dependence since they were originally as vile as was possible to be dependence degrades only the ingenuous but leaves the sordid mind in pristine meanness In this man∣ner therefore long continued generosity is misplaced or it is injurious it either finds a man worthless or it makes him so and true it is that the person who is contented to be often obliged ought not to have been obliged at all  It is perhaps one of the severest misfortunes of the great that they are in general obliged to live among men whose real value is lessened by dependence and whose minds are enslaved by obligation The hum∣ble  companion may have at first accepted patronage with generous views but soon he feels the mortifying influence of conscious inferiority by degrees he sinks into a flatterer and from flartery at last degenerates into STUPID VENERATION To remedy this the great often dismiss their old dependents and take new Such changes are falsely imputed to levity falsehood or caprice in the patron since they may be more justly ascribed to the client's gradual de∣terioration No my son a life of independence is ge∣nerally a life of virtue It is that which fits the soul for every flight of humanity freedom and friend∣ship To give should be our pleasure but to receive our shame serenity health and affluence attend the desire of rising by labour misery repentance and disrespect that of succeeding by extorted benevo∣lence the man who can thank himself alone for the happiness he enjoys is truely so and lovely far more lovely the sturdy gloom of laborious indigence than the fawning simper of thriving adulation  ON DOING GOOD TO OUR COUNTRY  From  SWIFT'S SERMONS  TEXTGal vi ver  As we have therefore op∣portunity les us do good unto all men  BUT beside this love we owe to every man in his particular capacity under the title of neigh∣bour there is a duty of a more large and extensive nature incumbent on us which is our love to our neighbour in his public capacity as he is a member of that great body the commonwealth and this is usually called love of the public and is a duty to which we are more strictly obliged than even that of loving even ourselves because therein ourselves are  also contained as well as all our neighbours in one great body This love of the public or of the com∣monwealth or love of our country was in ancient times properly known by the name of  virtue  because it was the greatest of all virtues and was supposed to contain all virtues in it and many great examples of this virtue are left us on record scarcely to be believed or even conceived in such a base corrupted wicked age as this we live in In those times it was common for men to sacrifice their lives for the good of their country although they had neither hope or belief of future rewards whereas in our days very few make the least scruple of sacrificing a whole nation as well as their own souls for a little present gain which often hath been known to end in their own ruin in this world as it certainly must in that to come  Have we not seen men for the sake of some petty employment give up the very natural rights and li∣berties of their country and of mankind in the ruin of which themselves must at last be involved are not these corruptions gotten among the meanest of our people who for a price of money will give their votes at a venture for the disposal of their own lives and fortunes without considering whether it be to those who are most likely betray or to defend them  But if I were to produce only one instance of a hundred wherein we fail in this duty of loving our country it would be an endless labour and therefore I shall not attempt it  But here I would not be misunderstood but the love of our country I do not mean Loyalty to our King for that is a duty of another nature and a man may be very loyal in the common sense of the word without one grain of public good at his heart Witness this very kingdom we live in I verily believe that since the beginning of the world no nation upon earth ever shewed all circumstances considered such high constant marks of loyalty in all  their actions and behaviour as we have done and at the same time no people ever appeared more ut∣terly void of what is called a public spirit When I say the people I mean the bulk or mass of the peo∣ple for I have nothing to do with those in power  Therefore I shall think my time not ill spent if I can persuade most or all of you who hear me to shew the love you have for your country by endea∣vouring in your several stations to do all the pub∣lic good you are able For I am certainly persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare  I therefore undertake to shew you three things  First That there are few people so weak or mean who have it not sometimes in their power to be use∣ful to the public  Secondly That it is often in the power of the meanest among mankind to do mischief to the pub∣lic  And lastly That all wilful injuries done to the public are very great and aggravated sins in the sight of God  First then there are few people so weak or mean who have it not sometimes in their power to be use∣ful to the public  Solomon tells us of a poor wise man who saved a city by his counsel It hath often happened that a private soldier by some unexpected brave attempt hath been instrumental in obtaining a great victory How many obscure men have been authors of very useful inventions whereof the world now reaps the benefit The very example of honesty and industry in a poor tradesman will sometimes spread through a neighbourhood when others see how successful he is and thus so many useful members are gained for which the whole body of the public is the better Whoever is blessed whith a true public spirit God will certainly put it into his way to make use of that  blessing for the end it was given him by some mean or other and therefore it hath been observed in most ages that the greatest actions for the benefit of the commonwealth have been performed by the wisdom or courage the contrivance or industry of particular men and not of numbers and that the safety of a nation hath often been owing to those hands from whence it was least expected  THE YEAR NINETYTHREE A SONG  COME hither good people come

Slavery  Then raise your warlike banners high  And rally under Liberty  No longer war of Kings the spoil  Usurping nations shall divide  Nor stain with blood each fruitful soil  By Nature form'd to be allied  But Britons hope the world to see  Unite in Peace and Liberty  A DESCRIPTION OF GOVERNMENT AS REALLY OR FICTITIOUSLY FREE  By Dr  PRICE  I Have observed that though in a great state all the individuals that compose it cannot be admitted to an immediate participation in the powers of legisla∣tion  and government yet they may participate in these powers by a delegation of them to a body of representativesIn this case it is evident that the state will be still  free  or  selfgoverned  and that it will be more or less so in proportion as it is more or less fairly and adequately represented If the persons to whom the trust of government is committed hold their places for short terms if they are chosen by the unbiassed voices of a majority of the state and sub∣ject to their instructions Liberty will be enjoyed in its highest degree But if they are chosen for long terms by a part only of the state and if during that term they are subject to no controul from their consti∣tuents the very idea of liberty will be lost and the power of chusing representatives becomes nothing but a power lodged in a  few  to chuse at certain pe∣riods a body of  masters  for themselves and for the rest of the community And if a state is so sunk that the majority of its representatives are elected by a handful of the meanest persons in it whose voices are always paid for and if also there is a higher will on which even these mock representatives them∣selves depend and that directs their voices in these circumstances it will be an abuse of language to say that the state possesses liberty Private men indeed might be allowed the exercise of liberty as they might also under the most despotic government but it would be an  indulgence  or  connivance  derived from the spirit of the times or from an accidental mild∣ness in the administration And rather than be go∣verned in such a manner it would perhaps be better to be governed by the will of one man without any representation for a representation so degenerated could answer no other end than to mislead and de∣ceive by disguising slavery and keeping up a  form  of liberty when the  reality  was lost  THE ADVANTAGES ACCRUING TO MAN∣KIND FROM A HABITUAL CONSCIOUS∣NESS OF THEIR BEING EQUAL  From  Barlow's Advice to Privileged Orders  IN the United States of America the Science of Li∣berty is universally understood felt and prac∣tised as much by the simple as the wise the weak as the strong The deeprooted and inveterate ha∣bit of thinking that  all men are equal in their Rights  that  it is impossible to make them otherwise  and this being their undisturbed belief they have no concep∣tion how any man in his senses can entertain any other This point once settled every thing is set∣tled Many operations which in Europe have been considered as incredible tales or dangerous experi∣ments are but the infallible consequences of this great principle The first of these operations is  the Business of Election  which with that people is carried on with as much gravity as their daily labour There is no jealousy on the occasion nothing lucrative in office any man in society may attain to any place in the government and may exercise its functions They believe that there is nothing more difficult in the management of the affairs of a nation than the affairs of a family that it only requires more hands They believe that it is the juggle of keeping up im∣positions to blind the eyes of the vulgar that con∣stitutes the intricacy of state Banish the mysticism of inequality and you banish almost all the evils attendant on human nature  Another consequence of the habitual idea of Equality is the  facility of changing the structure of their Government  whenever and as often as the Society shall think there is any thing in it to amend As  Mr Burke has written no "Reflections on the Re∣volution" in America the people there have never been told that they had no  right  "to frame a go∣vernment for themselves" they have therefore done much of this business without ever affixing to it the idea of "Sacrilege" or "Usurpation" or any other term of rant to be found in that Gentleman's Voca∣bulary  Within a few years the Fifteen States have not only framed each its own StateConstitution and Two successive Federal Constitutions but since the settlement of the present general Government in the year three of the States Pennsylvania SouthCarolina and Georgia have totally newmodeled their own And all this is done without the least confusion the operation being scarcely known be∣yond the limits of the State where it is performed Thus they are in the habit of  "choosing their own Governors"  of  "cashiering them for misconduct"  of  "framing a Government for themselves"  and all those abominable things the mere naming of which in Mr Burke's opinion has polluted the pulpit in the Old Jewry  The  SECOND VOLUME  will be Published as the  FIRST  namely in  PENNY NUMBERS  Weekly
