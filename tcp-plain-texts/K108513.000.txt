 A Token for Mariners  A TOKEN FOR  MARINERS  CONTAINING Many Famous and Wonderful In∣stances of  God's Providence  in SEA DANGER and DELIVERANCES in Mercifully preserving the Lives of his Poor Creatures when in Humane Probability at the Point of Perishing by  Shipwrack Famine  or other  Accidents  uch Enlarg'd with the  Addition  of ma∣ny New  Relations Mostly Attested by the Persons themselves  ALSO The  Seaman's Preacher  ing a  Sermon  on the Right Improvement of such MERCIES And  Prayers for Seamen on all Occasions  LONDON  nted for  H N  and S H by the Bookselle  s  THE Preface  to the  Reader And Particularly to  Mariners  and other  SeafaringMen  THO' God's Wonders are every where visible and his Mercies no where hid from the Eyes of Man yet more par∣ticularly are they Evident to  SeafaringMen  whose Business is in the Great Waters and their Lives exposed more than others to Innu∣merable Hazards and Dangers of  Contend∣ing Winds  and  Seas Rocks Quicksands  and  Inhospitable Shores  These as it were carry their Lives in their Hands and their best Security is wholly to rely on the Provi∣dence and Protection of him  whose Power the Wind and the Waves obey  Seeing there is so small a Partition between them and Eternity the Striking on a treacherous  Rock  over which many times the Flatter∣ing Waves smoothly glide gives them their  Windingsheet in a Rumpled Wave Nor  this all their Danger the Springing of  Plank a Leak not to be found nor sudden∣ly stopt running on a Shoal or the falling of a Waterspout frequently carry with them the same Inevitable Fate and often makes them at their Wits End before they en  their Lives for a certain Prospect of Una∣voidable Death must needs be Terrible to Flesh and Blood and in a great measure remove that Constant Presence of Mind that should support their Spirits amidst all Dan∣gers From this there is no way to secure themselves but by laying hold on him that i  Mighty and able to save to the utmost  God who is a present help at need whose Eyes are in all Places in Heaven and Earth and in the great  Deep  and those that Cry t  him in their Distress he will surely hear them and deliver them out of all their Troubles if they are sincere in Heart and walk uprightly with him For a Praying  Paul's  sake w  find tho' the Ship was broken and perished on a Rock on the Coast of the Island antiently  Melita  now called  Malta  all that were in it were saved when they expected nothing less than to be swallowed up in that dange∣rous Ocean as we find in the  Acts  Chap    Therefore the best thing I can recom∣mend to  Mariners  and others that Navi∣gate the Deep is to have a stedfast Reliance  on God in all their Dangers nay at all times for that is the best and surest Anchor hold and Security that recourse to can be had and therefore I have furnished this Book with ma∣ny Wonderful and Remarkable  SeaDelive∣rances  to show them that their Hopes are not in vain for the Wonders he has already wrought he will doubtless continue to all that fear and put their Trust in him  This  Collection  is taken mostly from the Mouths of those who have experienc'd God's Mercy this way and whose Dangers have been as great as any could be on this side the Grave yet God in his Mercy delivered them out of all The rest are taken from such Reverend  Authors  that their Credit and Integrity is indisputable being purposely writ∣ten to raise the Minds of Men to contem∣plate and adore the Love and Goodness of the All wise Creator of the Universe and may indifferently serve to this end as well at  Land  as  Sea  though chiefly intended for  Seafa∣ring  Men to put them in Mind when they read it of their Danger and what they may expect in their Danger from the Death they apprehend in it if they apply their Hearts to true Wisdom When all Help or Hopes fail or seem to be at a loss then fix your Hearts and Eyes stedfastly on him who is able to do all things and to whom nothing is impossible on him in whose Hands is all the  Breath of Life who can stop the Shafts of Death in their winged Motion check the Bel∣lowing Thunder in the Mid Volley and turn the Raging of the Winds to a sudden Calm  But not to be tedious in a  Preface  I re∣commend this to you as a suitable Compa∣nion in your Voyages or Travels nay in your Houses or at all times that you may know these things are the  Lord's doing tho' they are Marvellous in your Eyes  And so conclude subscribing my self  Christian Reader  Your Friend and Servant  JJ  REMARKABLE SEA  Deliverances  ONE Major  Gibbons  a Man well known in  New England  a Gen∣tleman of good Education good Parts and of good Conversation as the Author hath been credibly inform'd by them that knew him was bound upon a Voyage to Sea himself being  Super Cargo  with such Commodities as those Parts of  America  affords after going out from  Boston  several days by hard Weather and contrary Winds the Ships Company were much distress'd and by the Continuance of contrary Winds Provisions now begin  o fail them and O how feeble do Spi∣rits grow when Bread the staff of Life fails Now Hunger becomes more dread∣ful to them than the every Moment t  reatning Billows of the devouring  Ocean and they that one while fear'd drowning now fear starving they are brought to the last meal in the Barrel and the last oyl in the Cruse and say  We will Eat this little that is left and dye  And now when they thought they had eaten the last what conflicts must they needs have within themselves who knew not where to have another morsel to fortifie their tired and spent Spirits with the constant toil and hard labour How they look one upon another as men already under a Sentence of Death And by one ano∣thers Looks strike terror to one anothers Hearts They look on every side  Psal    as David  says  I looked on my right hand but there was no man that would know me Refuge failed me  or perished from me They look downwards and see nothing but the Belly of destruction opening for them they look upwards the onely and last refuge and reme  y in this deplorable estate and  out of the depths they cry'd to the Lord  But tho' they look out of the Ship as  Noah  did out of his Ark upon the waters and send forth the Dove of Prayer that winged Messenger to Heaven yet she brings no Olivebranch no Answer the Waters asswage not the Winds calm not they are like the Prophets Servant when  he bids him  Kings    Go up now and look towards the Sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing  and this strikes them into doleful and dismal La∣mentations out of which Lamentations at last springs up a tragical and sorrowful Motion The Motion is that which the Mariners in  Jonah's  Vessel put in execu∣tion  Come let us cast Lots  c only with this difference they cast Lots to find out the Delinquent and these which of them should die first to be a Sacrifice for ravenous Hunger to feed upon Conclu∣ding as he in that case  John    It is expedient for us that one man should die for the People and that the whole Ships Company pe∣rish not  Life being sweet Skin for Skin and all that a Man hath will he give for his Life they at last bring it through many a sad debate to a result they cast the Lot  the disposing of which is of the Lord  one of the Company is arrested by the Lot here is the Condemn'd Prisoner O but where is the Executioner to be found to act his Office upon a poor Innocent Is it not Death to them now to think who shall act this bloody part in the Tragedy But before they fall upon their involuntary Executi∣on Major  Gibbons  calls them to Prayer considering that in the Moment the Lord is often seen and that many times our Ex∣tremity  proves God's Opportunity he also asks the poor Man if he was willing to die but O what a hard Question is that to Answer He replies  if it might preserve the rest of the Lives he could be the more willing  to which he hath this An∣swer  All Events are in the hands of God we must not dispute them  to Prayer they go and O sure these Prayers must melt hearts of Adamant and Behold while they are at it God sends a visible Commentary up∣on that Scripture  Esa    Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall Answer thou shalt Cry and he shall say here I am  For while they were calling God was an∣swering there leaps a mighty Fish into the Boat and as it is said of the Whale that swallowed up  Jonah God prepared a Fish  so the Lord here prepared or pro∣vided a Fish that a poor creature might not be swallowed up But O what joy was here at such a token for good it not only at present relieving and refreshing their Hunger which no Question made them quick Cooks but when they look'd upon the Finger of God in it sending it as an answer to Prayer they conclude it an happy Omen of their Deliverance and a pledge of approaching Mercy but alas it is not long before their Hearts grew faint again their Countenances pale  their Spirits sink now as low as they were lifted up high and now the poor Seamen are like their Ship one while mounted up in hopes to Heaven and another while they are sunk down again in despair as low as Hell they know not now of another Cake another Morsel they are reduc'd to their former Exigency which brings them to a resolve to steer in this strait their old course to Lots they go again the second time only they have such an Honour for the Providence of God they will not put him into condemnation that God hath acquitted the Lot now falls upon another Person and O now they re∣ceive the old trouble and intestine Com∣bats how they shall find in their Hearts to punish one that never had offended any of them and while one thinks of it says he  Alas poor Man what hath he done to deserve this Sentence  another crys  Will not this Blood cleave to my Conscience another day tho' I went to this expedition a Prest Soldier  another says  for his part he fees no way but Death therefore he cannot take away Life when he sees not any Life can be preserved by it  but they are call'd again to look up∣ward before they put the Knife to the Throat of this Sacrifice and they remem∣ber the last Encouragement to put Life into almost the Deadmens Prayers they  pray now with a pledge in their Hands and are ready to tell God the last time he gave them a Pawn an Earnest and O it is not in vain to seek the Lord For lo while they are seeking to him he is send∣ing to them as the Prayers fly to Hea∣ven Mercy is dispatch'd upon the wing from Heaven  O turn aside and see this great sight while they are praying Behold a second Answer from above A great Bird lights and fixes her self upon the Mast which one in the Company espies and up he goes and there he stands till he took her with his Hand by the wing and brought her down to the Company and O what life from the dead is this to them a second time Sure they will hearken to the voice of the second Sign if not to the voice of the first and now that which they hoped by the first Providence  viz  that it was a forerunner of their compleat Deli∣verance Now they are by this second con∣firm'd in the Faith and now they begin to think as I can easily imagine if God will save them out of this distress O what manner of Persons they will become what manner of Lives they will live what Sacrifices of Thanksgiving they will offer up to God but while they are thus think∣ing they have no visible hopes but that it  must be a third Miracle that brings them out of this their miserable condition they have the same disappointments upon them still only now they divert their Hunger all they can by telling of and remem∣bring the Loaves as I may say their experiences in this extremity of theirs and comforting themselves that if they come to a third strait it would they ho∣ped be an outlet from their present Mi∣sery and Calamity They are reduc'd the third time to their former course and strait to cast Lots and when they were to go to the Heartaking work to put him to Death upon whom the Lot fell they go to their Old Friend in a day of Adversity to God by hearty and hum∣ble Prayer And O now they do as the Prophet's Man at the Sea side look again and again but alas Master they cry  there is nothing  Prayer is done concluded no∣thing appears O but as the Prophet's Man looked seven times so says this good Man Major  Gibbons  look again as  Jonah I will look again towards his Holy Temple  says he to one of the Company  Go up to the top and see what you can espy  and at last he makes a Sail  viz  espies a Ship this put new life into all their spirits they bear up with the Vessel they Man their Boat they desire in the manner of  perishing humble Suppliants to board them which they are admitted the Ves∣sel proves a  French  Vessel yea a  French  Pirate Major  Gibbons  petitions him for a little Bread to sustain their Lives who had been several days wishing for Death but could not find it in their extremity and to take the Ship and Cargo So sweet is Life that  all that a Man hath will he give for his Life  and now behold God draws forth to the poor Perishing Men his best Wine at the last nay turns the Water of Affliction into the Wine of Consolation The Commander of the Vessel knows the Major and replies readily and chearful∣ly Major  Gibbons  not one hair of your Head shall perish nor any of your Ships Company if it lie in my power either to supply you or preserve you O the Wisdom of God that hath ways we know not of to relieve in the greatest straits and cause himself to be seen in the Mount The Commander of this  French  Pirate was one that some Years before Major  Gibbons  had shown signal Kindness to when his Life was in danger at  Boston  in  New England  Thus the Lord appeared a God hearing Prayers in Extremities which appearances are not to be forgot∣ten in succeeding Generations  O that Men would praise the Lord for his Goodness  and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men  Secondly  About the Year there arising a Storm and Tempest of troubles in the Church of  Scotland  five Ministers eminent for Piety Learning and their Honourable success in the Ministry were so hard born under by a prevailing Party imposing upon their Consciences that they were forc'd to Embarque themselves for  America  three of their Names were Mr  Levinston  Mr  Mackleland  and Mr  Blaire  with two more whom my Au∣thor could not call to mind  These good Men sailed half the Chan∣nel over about Leagues where they met with great distress of Weather which broke off the Rudder of their Ship and occasioned a desperate Leak to spring in her which expos'd them to imminent dan∣ger but they in this distress endeavour to hang on their Rudder again but often were they frustrated in their attempt to a total despair of effecting it They also laboured with the like unsuccessfulness to find out and stop the Leak this poor Ships Crew had labour'd also by pumping to keep the Ship above Water until all their few Hands were feeble and all their Hearts faint so that as so many  despair∣ing Persons  of Life they cease all endea∣vours  and yield themselves to Death ex∣pecting every Moment to be Entombed in the Belly of the Devouring Deep during the time of this their great Di∣stress the Ministers kept on their course as at other times of Worship  viz  the reading of a Chapter in course and taking observations from it with Prayers and Preaching which they did by turns at the crisis of this deplorable case it fell to be the Lot of Mr  Mackleland  to per∣form this Exercise a Man Austeer in his Life reserv'd in his Speech and of great Piety who was often observ'd to let fall many remarkable Prophetical Expressions of future Events the Chapter that at that time came to be read in course by him was the of  Exodus  which he had read all along until he came to the th  verse  where he made a full stop the verses run thus  And  Moses  besought the Lord his God and said Lord why doth thy Wrath wax hot against thy People which thou hast brought out of the Land of  Egypt  with great Power and a mighty Hand Wherefore should the Egyptians say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the Mountains and to con∣sume them from the face of the Earth Turn from thy severe Wrath and repent of this E∣vil against thy People  upon the reading  of these verses over again he declared to them the Case which  Moses  was here in∣terceeding for compared with his Expo∣stulation in the verse did parallel their case and considering the happy Event of that Argument which  Moses  used men∣tioned in the verse which runs thus  and the Lord repented of the Evil which he thought to do unto his People  he could not but comfortably hope that they might have the same Effect Nay he goes fur∣ther and his Spirit was raised into a pe∣remptory prediction that he durst assure them from his great Lord and Master that not one Hair of his Head shall fall to the ground after this he went to Prayer urging God with the same Argument and then rose up comfortably assuring his stedfastness in believing the same he advises the Seamen and the Company in the Ship to refresh themselve by taking some Meat the long fasling and hard labour having much infeebled them Then he encouraged them to make ano∣ther attempt to fasten the Rudder with∣out which they could not possibly make towards any Point for Shore He after advised them to clear the Ship as well as they could from Water by Pumping which they did happily effect the Leak being stopt providentially of it self  whether it was some noak of a Plank started by the distress of Weather which occasion'd the Leak and by the surges of the Sea clapt into the place again or what it was else could not be known But however this looks like Life from the Dead to these poor Men who had received but a little before Sentence of Death in themselves that they might trust in him who raiseth the Dead Soon after this God who had heard in Hea∣ven their Tears and Prayers Commands the Wind to Tack about to the West and to blow so strong a Gale that they were forc'd to bear up before it and it continued so long that it brought them back to the North of  Ireland  where they continued some time altho' but short they were very instrumental in the Con∣verting of many Souls which seedplot remains to this Day and soon after they passed into  Scotland  This Relation was given by several Ministers of the North of  Ireland  also the Reader may take no∣tice the Author of that Book called the  Fulfilling of the Scriptures  page men∣tions this remarkable Providence tho' not so largely with these two additional but very considerable circumstances first That a poor Seaman was made the in∣strument to preserve the same Vessel by  fastening the Rudder whose Company they had all shun'd others having given it over Secondly Several Passengers being Aboard who Shipt themselves for  America  upon only external accounts expecting a fat Soyl and outward advan∣tage in that Place and not as the others upon the account of Conscience to en∣joy the purity of Ordinances they did all Die upon the Sea save one being five in Number And who is so Blind as can∣not see here the outstretch'd Arm of an Omnipotent God commanding delive∣rance for his poor distressed persecuted praying believing Servants and also for all them that sailed with them O who would not Pray at Sea and trust in him who raises the dead in the saddest of their Extremities and Distress and speaks forth much of the power and goodness of God calling upon all to trust in him let the dangers and straits be never so great  A Vessel of ours about the Year being at  NewfoundLand  a Fishing being somewhat of the latest in the year until the Ice came in great flakes and being ready to hoise Sail for their return home they sent out in the Boat six of the Men to weigh their Anchor but while they were about it a sad Providence pre∣vents them a great flake of Ice interposes  between them and their Ship and car∣ries them adrift so that by all means that they and the Ship could use they could not recover their Vessel again whereby they were expos'd to an inevitable ruine neither having Food nor any other Ac∣commodation to keep them warm they having continued thus three days and three nights they began to be Hunger∣starv'd and accounting themselves all dead Men they began to consult one with another what course to take they at last tho' with great regret and grief resolve one of them must die to become Food for the rest each Person begg'd to have it his Lot to die first to be freed from that torment that they languished under so that they were forced to de∣termine it by Lot He upon whom the Lot fell desir'd to go to one end of the Boat there to recommend his Soul to God by Prayer before he dyed the rest being in a deep Agony upon the appre∣hension of shedding the Blood of one of their Comrades But while they were sat together lamenting and imploring God's favour to prevent such a fact ac∣cording to that they wish'd and desir'd the Person separated by Lot for Death dyed upon the place where he was pray∣ing which in their deplorable Condition  occasioned great Joy to the rest that hereby they were not forced against their Wills to take his Life so looking upon this as a good  Omen  they proceeded to satisfie their Hungers upon the dead Body The Boat was still adrift not frozen up so that by that time their Food was spent they were brought ashore many Leagues  o the Northward of  NewEngland  where the five landed alive and the poor  Bar∣barians  did commiserate them and help them as they could three of them died with the Distress they had been in the other two made a shift to get to  NewEngland  and so at last by a good Hand upon them came to their Habitations in the West of  England  having both lost their Heels with the Extremity of the Cold in the Boat This Relation my Author had from one of these two Seamen with whom he came afterwards a Passenger from  Ireland  to whom he shew∣ed his Heels so lost  A small Vessel about Tun the Master's Name  Philip Hangare  coming upon the Coast of  NewEngland  they suddenly sprang a Leak and so foundred There were in this poor miscarrying Ves∣sel Seamen and Passengers of the Men got into the Longboat and as that was suddenly brought to their Minds in  this Surprise they threw into their Boat also some small matters of Provisions but they were wholly without Fire These Men at that time of the Year about  Michaelmas  and as  Paul  said in his Voy∣age  Sailing was become Dangerous  sailed five hundred Leagues and were to a Mi∣racle preserved all that time in this small Boat five Weeks but it pleased the Lord who appears in our straits most to send them great Relief by causing some flying Fish to fall into the Boat which they eat raw and were unto them more accepta∣ble than the greatest Rarities and Dain∣ties at another time God's Providence now proving the Caterer they catch'd a Shark and that ravenous Fish that uses to prey upon Men now becomes a Prey to these poor distressed Creatures but they were glad of Food in the want of Fire and have an Heat in their Stomachs to eat that raw and digest at this time what would have made them sick at other times but alas another Want they had was Drink as well as Fire but they were forced to open the Belly of this Shark and suck his Blood for Drink at last that God who hath a Desire to the Work of his own Hands gives them Hopes to release them out of this insupportable Misery by letting them come to a Discovery of  Land in the  WestIndies  but alas they were so Weak that when they came a∣shore one or two of them Dyed but most of them liv'd to declare the Works of the Lord This the Author had from one of the that were thus miraculous∣ly preserv'd but since cast away at Sea  Captain  Jonas Clark  of  NewEng∣land  going to  Virginia  the Vessel was Cast away in a strange amazing manner about two hours before day among the  Indians  where the Shipwrackt Men lay  shore in great fear but three days after  hey thought to get their Ship off again  o which end the Master with some o∣  hers went into the Boat they came Fathom from the shore where there a∣  ose a great Sea and broke in upon them  ut the second Sea came and turn'd the Boat up four Men under Water all were  rowned but Capt  Clark  who was kept  nder water by one of the Men till his  reath was near gone but then God ap∣  ear'd and set him at liberty from him in most Miraculous way and enabled him  swim to the shore they that were a∣  ve now were in great straits and per∣  lexities not knowing what to do but  et some of their Eyes were up to God  t last they unanimously resolve to Tra∣  el and when they had Travelled one  Night and part of a Day meeting with many Swamps and thick places so that all hope fail'd them of going along so they stood still as wayfaring Men asto∣nish'd not knowing what course to take and tho' before they were afraid of any  Indians  now they were glad to pray to the Lord for the sight of an  Indian  which in this extremity and perplexity within half an hour the Lord was pleased to grant The  Indian  was all alone which was observable also when they got to him they asked the way to the  English  and they did persuade him by entreaty to go along with them but within one hours time he carried them to a Town of the  Indians  which did sadly fright and amaze them but they still looked up to the Lord to help and save them and at last they got to the  English  and so were preserved This Relation the Author had from Captain  Clark's  own Hand a Person of known Godliness and Integrity  The last Providence called to mind a strange and stupendous passage of a Godly Gentlewoman who in the first breaking forth of the Rebellion in  Ireland  was forc'd to fly for her Life with some other Persons in her Company especial∣ly three Children one of them upon her Breast But alas these poor trembling  Travellers had not gone long before they were stripp'd Naked by the  Irish  who to admiration spar'd their Lives but passing on to the foot of a River others met'em and would have cast 'em into the River but this Godly Woman not being dis∣may'd ask'd a little liberty to Pray and as she lay on frozen ground Naked she got a little resolution not to go on her own Feet to so unjust a Death upon which having call'd her upon her reso∣lution they drag'd her by the Heels a∣long the ground with the rest of the Company she turns upon them and on her Knees says  You should I am sure be Christians and Men I see you are in taking away our miserable Lives you do us a plea∣sure but know as we never wronged you nor yours you must die also your selves and one day give an account of this Cruelty to the Judge of Heaven and Earth  Suddenly up∣on which an  Irish  Priest says  Let us not take their Lives but we will put them in this Island of the Lake  a Boat being at the River all the eight Naked and without Meat are turn'd into that Island where after four days staying some of the Com∣pany dy'd with Hunger and Cold but not this Woman nor any of her Chil∣dren a day after the two Boys found the Hyde of a Beast which had been  kill'd at the Root of a Tree which they and the Mother endeavour'd to cast ove  them then lying upon the Snow the next day a little Boat goes by to whom she calls for God's sake to take her out but they refus'd being  Irish  she desir'd a little Bread but they had none she beg  a Coal of Fire which she obtain'd fo  they had some Fewel in the Boat an  thus with some fallen Chips made a Fire and the Boys taking a piece of the Hide laid it upon the Coals and bega  to gnaw the Leather but alas withou  an extraordinary Divine support wha  could this do Thus they liv'd ten day  without any visible supplies and tha  good Woman profest it was by Faith and Joy in God she liv'd nor had she any Bread but Ice and Snow nor any Drink but Water but she thought God put more substance in it and found it as it were clammy The next day a Boa  carried her out to the side of the  Band∣water  where yet she had been lost bu  that she could not suffer to see her Chil∣dren Die in her sight and therefore tho  the two Boys were young and so Starv'd that they had no strength she pressed them to go out of her sight under pre∣tence of seeking some Fire the poo  Children had not gone far until they saw  or great Dogs eating a Man who had been kill'd the Children were not afraid of the  Dogs  who needed not fear any thing but to live in such a Condition and one of them came running and leaped upon one of the Children with∣out doing him the least hurt and would run a little before and then tarry until the Children came up and so led them on to an House whence Smoak appear'd which was an  Irish Man's  Protected by the  English  in  Antrum  by which means they were marvellously preserv'd and the Mother sent for and succour'd by a par∣ty from  Antrum  Altho' this Providence be not a  SeaDeliverance  yet it is a re∣markable preservation from Danger by Water and Hunger by Land  In the first setling of the  Bahama  Islands off of the  Cape  of  Florida  about the Year there were at that present great troubles in the  Burmudas  one Cap∣tain  Sale  who had been Governour the Year before comes for  London  and here informing some of his Acquaintance and Persons of Worth and Estate how things then stood they undertake for him and got him a Ship and all things necessary for the discovery of these  Islands  which he had inform'd them of so they proceeded to  Burmudas  where they took  in several Passengers Capt  Sale  being Chief and Capt  Lane  and his Family who came from  London  with him as his Assistant in the management of the Design so they in pursuit of the Voy∣age came to an Island call'd  Cicatra  he lay down in the Platts where they could not at present find an Harbour So they sent out their  Shallop  upon a Discovery which upon Return inform'd them of a better place to Ride inBut sending out the  Shallop  again upon a Discovery before she Return'd there arose a dread∣ful Storm that carried her immediately upon the  Rocks  and stav'd her with ve∣ry much difficulty most of the People were sav'd and some Provisions Then were they Reduc'd to very great straits formidable to Flesh and Blood a Barren Island no Inhabitants no likelihood of Relief little Provisions left in this great strait most of them resolv'd to Travel up to the Western end of the Island and there to abide Capt  Lane  and his Family and Son who was Lieutenant resolv'd to seek for some kind of Provisions and so staid on the Island But Captain  Sale  and one Mr  Bounly  who had been Master of the Ship and some other  Seamen  and one Mr  Shadwel  in all eight resolv'd to go  to  Virginia  and took what Provisions they could get which was one  Shark  but before they made to the Land they were in very great want for from this Island from whence they departed to  Virginia  was Leagues In their now great Extremity Providence car'd for them so that they got another  Shark  and were glad to eat him Raw They were days going to  Virginia  and the  Boat  a very little one that they could scarcely Steer in her for fear of Danger Yet the Lord in this deep Destress  made his Arm bare for their Salvation  and brought them safe to a place call'd  Nuse∣mum  to one Mr  Rich Brunkets  House where they were courteously Entertain∣ed and after the Relation upon what account they were put to these Hard∣ships and Necessities Capt  Sale  had a Vessel provided Laden with Necessaries to go for  Cicatra  to relieve those they had left there in such Distress and they arrived there And O now what Com∣fort must this be after such long Wish∣ing and gradual Dying to see that there was no Hopes of Life brought to them but several of them were starv'd to Death before their arrival Capt  Lane  is now sent to fetch some Provisions who had been in unspeakable Extremity He  came down in a little  Boat  his Son also the Lieutenant and two Servants but when they had gotten in their Provisi∣on and going home in hopes of a new Life Behold the stupendous Provi∣dence of God all of a sudden Death creeps in and arrests them For in a narrow place where the Tyde runs swiftly the  Boat  is sunk all are drown'd but one Man who carried the desolate Widow the sad Tydings What an un∣welcome Messenger this was you may may easily conjecture about Months after arrived a Vessel to them the Ma∣ster of her my Author and so Mrs  Lane  her Son and Daughter Maidservant and Manservant were all brought up a∣bout Miles where they were Enter∣tain'd by my Author for Weeks and gave an account of some notable Passa∣ges of God's Providence in preserving them Worthy never to be forgotten Her Husband and the Men went out to see what they could get for Food every Day and they had for the most part just for the Day and she told my Author that she as a tenderhearted Mother would lay something by for her young Children but she observ'd that the next Day they never got any thing  And thus Providence train'd them up in the School of Faith but further she gave an account of one remarkable thing In the last day of the week upon a time it prov'd a very stormy Day and they being abroad a hunting for some support could get nothing The Husband and Son come home very much troubled and the Men that were gone into the Woods they could get nothing and they being very much troubled one took up a Resolution not to come home know∣ing there Captain would not suffer them to go and hunt on the Lord'sDay on the other hand they thought he would wonder what was become of them and fear lest evil had befallen them so they alter their Resolution to come home but empty of Relief this very Evening before the Sabbath in this perplexity of thoughts there fly over their Heads three gray  Geese  a wonder it was for such  Geese  were never before seen there nor after O says she to her Husband that we had some of them against to mor∣row observing they lighted in a Bottom she acquaints her Husband he says they have no shot left O says she here is a Porrenger melt it or cut it into peices which he did for expedition and charg'd his Peice and at the first shot kill'd them  allThese things and many more my Author had from her own Mouth after her marvellous Preservation  O that Men would Praise the Lord for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men  We have a very wonderful Delive∣rance recorded an honest poor Man in  Maulden  in  Essex  one  Gregory Crow  who with his Man and Boy was in his Boat going to fetch FullersEarth but by the way meeting a Storm his Boot was driven upon a bank of sand and there sunk The Men were glad to hang upon the Mast but poor  Crow  seeing his NewTestament in the water which he priz'd highly caught it up and took it into his Bosom the tyde being gone they were left upon the Sand at least ten Miles from Land now in this great Distress they made their prayers to the Lord that he would send some means of Deliverance For now within half an hour it would be Flood but in this little time before Flood they found a Chest wherein was five pounds six Shillings eight pence but honest  Crow  cast it into the Sea again saying  If the Lord will be pleas'd to save our lives he will provide us a little food  and so they went again up to the Mast where they to Admiration hung by the Arms and Leggs for ten hours together only the  Boy was so weary and beaten with the Waves that he fell off and was drowned now their fears increased upon them and they knew not what to do But  Crow  advises his Man to cut down the Mast and when the Flood comes again to sit upon it and so says he  it may please God to drive us to some Ship  this Counsel was taken they commit them∣selves to God upon the Mast and thus continu'd  Tuesday  Night  Wednesday  and  Wednesday  Night in which time the man was so tir'd out with Hunger Watching and Cold that he dyed now was  Crow  left alone in this sad and deplorable Con∣dition he pray'd now the more earnestly for some Succour and Relief but durst not Sleep lest the Sea should beat him off the Mast and when this distress'd mi∣serable object was almost spent his flesh sodden with Sea water and his Eyes al∣most clos'd up with Salt now in his Ex∣tremity the Lord makes it his oppor∣tunity and steps in by his Providence presents a Ship going for  Antwerp  ob∣serve here the Finger of God The wind not being favourable she was driven out of the way and espyed something a far off in the Sea but supposing it to be some Fisherboy steer'd from it  Crow  seeing this held up his Cap and shaked  it over his head whereby at length they were mov'd to go to him and so they took him in when he came into the Ship being half dead careful of his  NewTestament  he pluckt it out of his Bosom and gave it to some to dry They in the Ship were careful of him and with great difficulty recover'd him and carry'd him with them to  Antwerp  where the fame of his being miraculously deliver'd drew many to see him and relieve him with necessaries  Fox  's  Book of Martyrs  A Ship of  Holland  being driven a∣gainst her will came to a Place call'd  Zembla  where the Pole is elevated degrees they among many delays and great dangers scarce reach'd the  Aurange Islands  for now they were set fast in a Consolidated body of con∣tinu'd Ice which threaten'd them every moment at last being reduc'd to their ultimate hope they resolve to return the same way they came but now they find the Ship quite frozen up not far from shore and now they think they should winter in  Zembla  and wait for a better Season wherefore taking out Boards and Planks they built for themselves and their Stuff a poor shelter and by a good Providence the Tide bad thrown up a good quantity of Timber they not  knowing from whence it came it prov'd a great advantage to them during their abode here they had continual fights with Bears which sometimes were driven away with making great outcrys other whiles with Shot they found their flesh unwholesome for food For in this place the Maritime wild Beasts are the food to the wild Beast of the Land the fat of the Bears they made use of to burn for lights in the night these poor crea∣tures were at last after all other Humane Benefits left by the Sun in this Barren Country and left amongst none but wild Beasts The vast Mountains of Snow with great difficulty they re∣move lest the Habitation should be over∣whelm'd and if at any time they went forth their jaws were so benum'd they could scarce recover their former heat now the Bears in the Dark being dull of sight did not venture out to disturb them but multitudes of Foxes which they took in Traps and made of them both Victuals and Rayment and yet after all these dangers and difficulties God pre∣served them though indeed some of them dyed they were of them The chief of them was one  Jacob Hamskerk  who returned afterwards to  Amsterdam  Grotius  in his Annals  In the Year a Flemming named  Pickman  well known in  England  and  Holland  for the art he had for get∣ting out of the Sea the great Guns of that  Spanish  Fleet that was forced upon the Coast of  Ireland  and  Scotland  in the Year coming from  Dronthem  in  Norway  laden with Boards was over∣taken by a Calm during which the current of the Sea carryed him on a Rock or a little Island towards the ex∣tremity of  Scotland  where he was in some danger of being cast away to a∣void a wrack he commanded some of his Men to go into the  Shallop  and to tow off the Ship these having done so would needs go upon a certain Rock to seek for Eggs but as soon as they were got up into it they espy'd a man whence they imagine there were others lay there about and that he had made an Escape thither to avoid some Pirats which might Surprize their Ship so that they made all the haste they could to the  Shallop  and return'd to the Ship but the Calm con∣tinuing and the current of the Sea driv∣ing the Vessel against the Island they were forc'd to get into the Longboat and Tow her off again the Man they saw before was in the mean time come to the brink of the Island and made signs  to them with his hands entreating them to come nearer and falling on his Knees and joyning his Hands together he beg'd Relief from them at last com∣ing near the Island they saw some∣thing more like a Ghost than a living Person a body stark Naked black hairy of a meager and deform'd Countenance hollow and distorted Eyes which rais'd such Compassion in them that they pro∣fer'd to take him into their Boat at last with some difficulty they took him in they found upon the Island no Grass nor Trees nothing for Food nor any shelter but the ruins of a boat wherewith he had made him an Hut under which he might be cover'd from Rain and injuries of the Weather when they came to ask him who he was and how he came into that uninhabited place he reply'd to them he was an  English  Man and that a year before he was to go from  England  to  Dublin  in  Ireland  in the PassageBoat and that they were taken by a  French  Pyrate who by a Storm that immediately arose was forc'd to let go the PassageBoat left us to the mercy of the Waves which carryed us between  Ireland  and  Scotland  into the main Sea expecting to be cast away every minute as at last we were For the Bark being split against  the Rock where you took me in I esca∣ped with one of my Comrades into the I∣sland in a more wretched Condition than if swallow'd up by the Sea who then had been deliver'd out of the Extremities we were in for want of Meat and Drink of some of the Boards of our Boat we made the Hutt you saw and we took some Sea∣mews which we set a drying in the Wind and Sun and so eat them raw we found also in the Crevices of the Rock by the Sea side some Eggs Thus were we kept from starving but what we thought most insupportable was Thirst for there was no Water but what fell from Heaven we liv'd thus six Weeks comforting one another and finding some Ease in our common Misfortune till that being left a∣lone it began to grow insupportable to me for one Day awaking in the Morn∣ing and missing my Comrade I fell into such a Despair that I had some thought of casting my self head long and so put a final Period to that Affliction whereof I had but endur'd the one half while I had a Friend suffering with me I know not what became of him but I am of O∣pinion that he fell into the Sea seeking for Eggs I left with him my Knife with which we kill'd the SeaDogs and the Mews upon which we lived so I was  forc'd to get out of my Hutt a great Nail which I made a shift to sharpen upon the Rock that it serv'd me for a Knife I was also forc'd to lade a little Stick with a little Seadog Fat and put it out of a Crevice of my Hutt and so got some Mews to keep me from starving I liv'd in this Condition and Solitude Eleven Months and was resolv'd to end my days in it when God sent you to deliver me out of the greatest Misery that ever Man was in and this Seaman after this Mise∣ry and miraculous Preservation liv'd to return to  England  Ambassadors  Travels  A Remarkable Providence of God in wonder∣fully preserving of Eleven or Thirteen poor distressed Mens Lives  In the Year a Ketch sailed from  Salom  in  New England  for the  Barbadoes  and when they came into the Latitude of it began to look like foul Weather so they took in their Topsail and because it was towards Night they struck down the Main Sail and rased it and all this time there was but little Wind which was Remarkable if the ensuing Story be observ'd but still it looked like bad Wea∣ther so they sent up one to tallow the Mast and made no great haste to set sail the Man at the top thinks he sees some  black thing float upon the Sea and look∣ing upon it very fixtly he conceives it to be a Boat and so calls to the Men below so they hastned to hoise Sail and make to∣wards it and when they came to them there was a Longboat with or Men my Author could not absolutely remember the just Number which poor distressed Creatures had been bound for  Virginia  and the Ship in which they were prov'd very Leaky and so exceedingly increas'd that in a very little time she was ready to sink so all Hands hasten'd to get out the Boat but the Master stept into the Cabin to fetch a Compass and took some Canvas a Sailneedle and Twine which he thought might be use∣ful to them in their Need and Extremity but while this poor industrious Man was endeavouring to be useful to some other Mens Lives he was in danger to lose his own for the Boat was put off and the Ship was sinking so he crys to them in this Di∣stress  if they would leave him and there let him perish  so they came back and took him in they had in their Boat a CapsternBar which they made use of for a Mast and a piece of Canvas for a Sail and so sailed afore the Wind and had no kind of Food and now comes dreadful and inexpressible Distress upon them making them wish for  Death it self to give them a Deliverance now all Hopes of Relief fail'd them thus they continu'd five Days some grew Lame others Feeble and all much Dis∣hearten'd by Despair of Life and now upon the th Day they had concluded to cast Lots for their Lives who should die to preserve others and they put their Resolution into Execution and that poor Creature upon whom the Lot fell begs for Time but alas what will a Reprieve be in this Case where there is no hope of Relief but O what difficult Work is it to die what a strait was here Live he could not and die he could not well a little time is defer'd and behold a Won∣derworking God appears now for him and for them all before Night they e∣spy'd this Ketch which rais'd them all to Admiration but they had Fears in this Distress that the Ketch did not see them but when they perceiv'd the Ketch made to them O what a new Life did it put into these dying Men so they all got safe aboard And see here the Goodness of God In one Hour after there arose a most dreadful Storm which continu'd for forty Hours and all of them safely arriv'd at  Barbadoes  The Master's Name of the Ketch was  Thomas Woodberry  of  Salom  This the Au∣thor  had from a very known Person of In∣tegrity and Godliness now living at  Salom  In the Year in the Wars be∣twixt the  Netherlands  and the  Spaniards  upon the  Spanish  Ocean fell out this ob∣servable and remarkable Action taken notice of by  Grotius  in his Annnals of the LowCountry Wars Admiral  Hauteen  being sent to intercept the  Spanish  Fleet coming from  America  and the  Indies  he had with him four and twenty Vessels but of these six were beaten back by Tempests soon after  Frasciardo  with eight great Gallions having a prospe∣rous Gale fell upon them unprovided and e're they were aware but the Gal∣leys that were with him not being driven by the Wind kept by the Shore but one of them being grappl'd with a Ship of  Zealand  that was next the Admiral so affrighted the rest that as soon as they saw it they in the very beginning of the Night retreated with all haste  Hauteen  thus left by his Companions being a Man of an undaunted Spirit for two whole Days did not leave off the Fight though most of his Men were in that time lost but with his torn Ship casting off all fear of Danger protracted the Victory but after he saw no hopes of Relief and that the Waves pour'd in upon him that none  of them might come alive into the Ene∣mies Hands at once they unanimously agreed upon a resolute and terrible Acti∣on For kneeling down upon their Knees they like dying but desperate Men beg of God that he would please to pardon them in that they sought to shun the Mockeries and Cruelties of the  Spani∣ards  by that sad and lamentable Death so they set Fire to the Gunpowder by which Blow Men were kill'd half dead lived a little while being taken up by the  Spaniards  with Wonder beholding their dreadful Countenances and their Words with their strange Re∣solution and Obstinacy in Death  In the Year about the time when the Plantations of  Virginia  be∣gan to be a little settled by King  James  some  Britains  went to  Guyana  but a dan∣gerous Sedition arose in the Voyage and the Ship being lost part of the Company remained in the Island where continual∣ly vexing the  Barbarians  with their un∣kind Usage they at last were set upon by War as Enemies by force of which and the want of Victuals they commit∣ted themselves to Sea in a Boat made on∣ly of an hollow Tree there these poor distressed Creatures were tossed with con∣tinual Tempests betwixt Despair and  Hope of Life but at last they were dri∣ven upon the Rocks after great Misery endured by them in their little Boat for ten Days together and now their Dan∣ger was lessen'd for here they must fall into the Hands of the  Spaniard  who par∣don'd them in regard they came not to those Parts of their own accord but by the stress of Weather Thus were these poor distressed Men saved and preserved when all Hope of being saved was taken away  The  Phaenix  Frigot in the time when Captain  Whestone  commanded her and Mr  May  was Master being com∣manded to carry some Persons of Quality from  Rye  to  Diep  in  France  the Captain and several of the Gentlemen that be∣longed to the Frigot were ashore the Captain sends the Longboat aboard and order'd the Frigot to weigh and come to sail and stand to and fro off in the Bay and he would come out in his Pinnace the Gentlemen that were with him were  Sunebank Giles  his Chirurgion Mr  Good∣win  his Chaplain Mr  Perkins  his Barber and Gentleman Mr  Richards  and some three more Gentlemen Reformadoes  A∣braham Car  Coxswain and about Seamen for his Crew that set out of  Rye  and crossed the Bay to meet the Frigot un∣der  Sail and when they came near be∣  ng a good way ahead waved to the Frigot to keep her way and not to come  playse for her which she did with a  resh Top sail Gale of Wind till she came  p with the Pinnace and then the Cox∣  n would  laid her aboard of the Lar∣  ord side but the Captain supposing himself far enough ahead commanded  im to sh  ahead of her and lay her  board of the Starboardside which he as∣suming to do the Ship giving a saw and having fresh way the Pinnace was not past but the Cotwater of the Ship cut  he Pinnace in the middle and run right over that she lay in a moment of time  n a hundred pieces and all the Men floating for their Lives in the interim of which time with a Cry they gave a  eap in which leap the Captain catcht  old on the Rails of the Head Mr  Ri∣  hards  's on the Captain's Heels Mr  Giles  he Chirurgion on  Richards  's Heels Mr  Goodwin  on  Giles  's Heels and some other Person on his so that with that Spring  r Leap no less than or providenti∣ally catcht about one the others Heels or Middle as Boys when playing at Truss  nd in hoisting in the Captain they pre∣  erved or more with him the Cox∣  en sunk down and brought some of the  Tallow of the Lower part of the Ship on his Cloaths and came up again a  the Stern where he was taken up by the Seamen some by Swimming others by assistance of the Oar and pieces of the Boat by God's blessing kept them from Drowning till the Longboat took them all up except the Captain's Barber Mr  Perkins  whom it seems had sunk it's thought his last time but Providence so order'd it that the Man in the main Channel heaving the HandLead there fell a chrockle in the dipseyLine and in that very interim the Lead fell in the very place where the Barber was sunk and the chinckle of the Line fell about the Barbers Fingers hitcht about his Ring and so providentially fasten'd it self so that as the Man in the Scenes haling up his Lead found it to come heavier than it used to do admiring at last up come the Barber fasten'd in the chinckle by his Ring which the Spectators amazed at immediately took hold of him and pulled him into the Frigot with his Eyes fixed and Teeth set and little appearance of Life but by the blessing of God the im∣mediate means us'd and care of him he soon came to himself and recover'd so that notwithstanding this shrewd disa∣ster  which might have proved fatal to  ll or most of them yet there was not one Man of them all miscarried but was  ecover'd to their Health again as Mo∣  uments of God's Mercy For truth of his many of the Men are alive at this Day the Chirurgion now living in  GraysInnLane  and at the very interim  f time I was then aboard the said Frigot  nd was not only an Eyespectator but  n Instrument to help in preserving of  ome of them and therefore may Aver  to be Truth  Ezekiel Fog  About Years ago in the Island  f  Barbadoes  there did arrive one Mr  John Blackleach  from  New England  a  ery honest Man who gave account  at in his then Voyage his Son being Master of the Vessel and himself Mer∣  hant their Men at Sea did Mutiny at which occasion he and his Son were  rc'd to stand on their Guard for some me casting his care on the Lord But  hilst under this trouble being in the  ong Reach  in or near the Latitude of  arbadoes  they all did see a great Ship  hich stood towards them and while  ey were Looking on her to see how  st she came towards them she being  etty near vanish'd away which struck  e Men with great Fear and made  them humble themselves to the good Old Man and desir'd his Prayers for them  In the Month of  Novemb  the Ship  Prosperous  of  Bristol  sailed from thence being bound for  Galloway  in  Ire∣land  but was forced into  BrutsBay  in  Cornwall  where the Ship brake in pieces six Persons being Drowned and other wonderfully cast on Shore and bruised amongst the rest  John Denny  a Skinne  of  Bristol  was cast ashore by a Great Sea being much Bruised and almost Dead and was by some strip'd Naked and laid amongst the other Dead Folks that were taken up being only cover'd with some Straw or Rubbish But by Providence an old Man looking on the Dead People did perceive some Life in the said  Denny  and the Lord open'd his Heart that he strip'd himself of his own Shirt and some Cloaths and put on him and tock him from among the Dead Thro' his La∣bour and Love by God's Blessing the said  Denny  is now well and liveth at  Bristol  This my Author had from  John Denny  's own Mouth  In the Year I being at  Be∣ston  in  New England  I oft went to see an Acquaintance of mine one  Abraham Darby  a sober honest Man a Master of  a Vessel who relates the following Sto∣ry which he attests to be Truth That some few Years ago he the said  Darby  being Master of a small Ketch was  ound from  Barbadoes  to  Virginia  he having an  Irish  Woman a Servant on Board to be Deliver'd in  Virginia  but he was a vile Person and having often offended at last was punish'd for which  he said they should not carry her to  Vir∣ginia  tho' the Wind was very fair and carried them in sounding of the  Capes  of  Virginia  That they had bent one Cable to the Anchor thinking soon to got in  ut she still said they should not Then  he Wind sprang up of a sudden in a meer fret which for  'd them many Days off and their Provisions near spent it being if I mistake not in  then  he Wind came fair again a from Gal  and they before it in hopes to gain their Passage but on a sudden there  a great Sea that cas  the Vessel on  she having but little besides B  er that her Goods and things  But it pleased God they  he Helm a Weather and she wo  e and  ll Hands as could in the Hold brought  er to rights and the Wind continued  air till they came near the place that it  ook them short before and then took  them as before that they were forc'd off again for many Days having then but or pieces of Beef and no Bread nor I think a Gallon of fresh Water But after some time the Wind came fair they making Sail to get back it being fine Weather there came a great  Sea  and laid her down again and carried her Mast away and a part of the  Part∣ners  that hold the Mast that as she lay on one side the  Sea  rush'd into her but the Master with his Bed and Rug stopt the force till it pleased God they had shifted the things in the Hold and brought her to rights again now these poor Souls were left as a Wrack in the Ocean and neither Victuals nor Drink but strong Water and Sugar to help them but finding a Spar or Oars in the Hold made shift to get out a small Sail I had like to have omitted that whilst they had any Food they would have given this wicked Woman a part but she would not Eat any thing then it pleased God to send a fine Gale and they got on the Coast of  NewEngland  and sounding found about forty Fathom Water and very calm then they chopt to an Anchor there and that Night got two or three Fish wherewith they Re∣freshed themselves but the Woman  would not Eat but could get no more and finding a fine Gale weighed Anchor and thought to have got within  CapeGod  not being far off but the Wind came fresh against them and drove them off again to Sea and then 'twas Calm and about that time the Woman had fasted about Days and yet could Curse and Damn and say  She should not go a Shoar  but that Night the Master and some others being on the Deck spied a great black Thing rise out of the  Sea  to their thinking much bigger than the Ketch the  Sea  being Light all about and the Woman in the Hold made a great Noise and when she had given a great Screach or Groan this great black Thing Vanish'd the Water seeming like Fire all round and made a great  Sea  and Noise And when the Men came to themselves they looking for the Woman found her Dead but after they had flung her over∣board they had a brave Wind and Wea∣ther and got safe to  Plimonth  in  NewEngland  At  NewEngland  in the Year I spoke with  John Grafting  of  Salem  and others of good Repute who told me not long before the said  Grafting  suffer'd Ship∣wrack amongst the  Leward Islands  the Name of the Place I forget the Ship  or Ketch being broken to pieces himself and Mate and one or two were cast with the  Sea  ashoar amongst the Rocks most wonderfully not knowing of each other till by Providence they met amongst the Rocks it being an Island without Inha∣bitants if I mistake not and they brui∣sed yet the Lord provided for them in a wonderful manner and not only there but in their getting off that place and bringing them safe to their Friends and Relations in  Salem  in  New England  where Praises were returned to the Lord who wonderfully preserves the Children of Men  I hope this ere long will be en∣larged from the Party himself  I being well Acquainted with one  Jeffery Howard  a Mariner who is a Man of good Repute he told me as follow∣eth That about or Years since he was coming through the City of  Sa∣lisbury  he was looking on the Street Ri∣vers and spies something move on the Water but looking earnestly saw it to have Lise steps in and got it out and found it to be a Manchild only inrapt as it came into the World from its Mo∣ther and it was put to Nurse and now is become a fine Youth  At  Bristol  a place well known not many Years ago a Man fell into the  River near about the Marsh and not be∣ing seen was carry'd down with the Tide some way and I think could not swim but lay as Dead on the Water driving with the Tide but by providence some being in the Meadow going to Work or coming from the  Lymekilns  being by the Waterside Playing with a Spaniel saw something floating flung in things to make the Dog fetch it and the Dog accordingly took hold of the Man by the Cloaths and brought him a shoar and finding some Symptoms of Life took care of him and he came to Life and dwells in  New Bristol This I had from the Spectators  In the Year one Mr  Savage Master  of the  SocietyKetch  bound from  Bristol  to  Boston  in  New England  met on the Coast of  N E  the Ship call'd the  George  of  Bristol  being in distress spake with them the Ship having sprang a Leak their Men tired and spent with Pumping the Master and all his Com∣pany went on Board the Ketch with speed and soon after the Ship sunk  This I had from Mr  Savage  and other Pas∣sengers with him who affirm'd it to be truth  David Fogg  Capt  John Trankmore  Comman∣der of a Ship belonging to  Apsom  near  Exeter  in one of his Voyages of late Years being at  Sea  in a dark Night and foul Weather fell soul of another Ship unexpectedly not then knowing what each other were but a  Sea  parting them again in the interim Cap  Trankmore  's Ship Shipt a great  Sea  which washed the said  Trankmore  Overboard and ano∣ther  Sea  cast or hove him into the other Ship which fell out to be an  EnglishMan  bound for  Plimouth  Thus in the dark the  Wind  and  Sea  parts the said Ship without having knowledge of each other Capt  Trankmore  concluding that his own Ship was Foundred and all his Lost and God had wrought a won∣der of Mercy in his Preservation but so it fell out that one  Samuel Snytal  who was his Apprentice had obtain'd such Knowledge of the  Art of Navigation  and his Master being gone and as they sup∣pos'd Drown'd being wash'd Over∣board was necessitated to improve his skill and by God's Blessing he carry'd the Ship safe home to  Apsom  where Ar∣riving although they had made a good Voyage yet the sorrow for the loss of the Master eat up all the Comforts and Smiles a Prosperous Voyage otherwise would have made but so Providence order'd it that about or Days after  the other Ship Arrives safe in  Plimouth  where the said  Trankmore  landed very sorrowful and dejected having as he suppos'd lost his Ship wherein he was deeply concern'd as an Adventurer him∣self and all his Men as he was in the Morning walking on the  Hope  at  Pli∣mouth  very dejectedly he providentially meets with one of his Executors or  Apsom  Neighbours who looks him in the Face with Astonishment knowing him well and yet believing the Report of his being Dead or lost in amaze Sa∣lutes him with these Expressions  What Capt  Trankmore who replies  A poor Captain having lost my Ship richly Laden and after a good Voyage with all my Men not a Soul saved but my self whom by a Miracle God wrought Salvation for  as be∣fore Recited giving the Gentleman his Neighbour an account of his Providence towards him when after a little pause his Friend embraces him and with ad∣miring of the Providence bids him  be of good Heart for his Ship and all his Company was well and safe Arriv'd at  Apsom  for his Man  Samuel Snytal  had brought her safe home and all the Sorrow and Cry there was for the loss of him  Which reply made the said  Trankmore  in as much a∣maze on the other hand being almost  Incredulous of Truth till his Friend positively affirming it and then consult∣ing his own Mercy saw and was made sensible there was no Mercy too great for God to Work and thence took heart recovering himself went home rejoicing where he found his expectation answer∣ed and a welcome given him by all Persons with him concern'd  For the truth I have heard it acknow∣ledg'd by Capt  Trankmore's  own Mouth at my House in  Bristol  and farther the same  Snytal  was my Predecessor's Son and I have heard his Motherinlaw speak of it to seve∣ral and hath affirm'd it to me for a Truth  The  Bristol  Frigot when Capt  Fenn  was Commander being in the  Straits  in Chace of Capt  Popoctiene  a  Spanish  Knight of  Malta  who at that time our Squadron took and brought Prisoner to the  Tower  in pursuit of which Chace the Wind began to rise the Capt Com∣mands presently to get Topgallant Sails abroad and the Yards being not then Aloft Men run up presently where one stood on the top of the Shroud un∣der the Maintopmastcrosstrees a se∣cond stood a top of the Crosstrees and the other stood by the Topgallantmast on the Cape at the Maintopmasthead all expediting their Work in getting the  Topgallantsail abroad at which time the Wind freshen'd and carry'd our Maintopmast by the Board in which disaster the Man that was lowermost and least in danger fell over board and was drowned and the other two which were in greatest danger one of their Names was  Roger Dennis  under the De∣nomination of a Quaker instead of bein bruis'd and their Bones broken all to pieces which the Eye of Reason could not otherwise imagine by such a fall they both fell forward upon the Bunt of the Main course and one catches hold of the Main Buntlines and the other of the Leechlines and slack of a bow∣ling and so both come down to the Deck and neither of them in the least prejudic'd  For the truth of this my Author was then Aboard the said Frigot and was an Eye∣witness of this Providence  An Account of two Ships bound for  NewfoundLand  from some part in the West of  England  who by distress of Weather lost Company some days after being fair weather one of the Ships sprang a Leak and foundred in the Sea where every Soul perish'd except one Old Man who had lasht himself on the main Hatch and committed himself to  the Mercy of the Sea and God's Provi∣dence where he was floating three Days and three nights in which time about the middle of the second day the  Devil  assuming the shape of a Marmaid starts up before him and bids him  he of good heart for if he would but make a Contract with him he would ingage a Deliverance for him in    hours  the Old Man being sensible it was the Devil and doubtless having been a proving of his heart to God as the Cir∣cumstance of Providence he was under more immediately called for found in himself a renewed strength put into him enabling him to hold up his head and looking the Tempter in the Face Re∣plyes  Ah Satan if thou canst prophesy de∣liverance for me know my God in whom I trust will deliver me without thy help but however know I will dot comply to thy wiles therefore avoid Satan avoid  so immedi∣ately he Vanish'd and appear'd no more to him But so it fell out the other Ship being at that time in the same Place or Latitude that Night the CabbinBoy Dreams a Dream  that such a Ship there∣abouts was Foundred and every Soul lost except such an Old Man naming his Name who was saved on a piece of the Ship and floating in the Sea  which Dream the Boy in the Morning confidently tells to  the Company and his Master at last the Boy began to shew more Confidence affirming it as if it must be true inso∣much he receiv'd some Checks from his Master but however at last the Boy grew so restless that he running up from one Mast to another sometimes at Foretopmasthead looking abroad that at last crying out aloud  Alow there I see him I see him under our Leebow  thus confidently affirming it some of the Men stept up and spy'd something at a distance no begger than a Crow to ap∣pearance floating and advis'd the Master of it who presently commanded the Helm to be born up and stood away to it and when they came near found it to be the Old Man as the the Boy said so they hoyst out their Boat and took him in who then was speechless and almost spent but by the care of the Master and the Chirurgion with God's Blessing recover'd and gave a verbal ac∣count of his Misfortune and yet won∣derful deliverance together with Sa∣tan's Temptation as before recited which Ship in due time Arriv'd safe at her Port in  New foundLand  where this Man was well Landed a shore  For Confirmation I had this and heard it related at my Father's House in  Salom  in  NewEngland  by Mr  John Blackledge  a Merchant who is a Person of a sober life and in Fellowship there who then came from  NewfoundLand  and did affirm that he spake with the Man himself whom God wrought this wonderful deliverance for he being then at  NewfoundLand  when the said Ship Arriv'd there and the Man went first ashore    Anno Christi    May  the  Mos∣covy  Merchants of  London  sent a Ship call'd the  Salutation  of  London  for  Greenland  which arriv'd there in safety  June  following together with two other Ships all which were commanded by Captain  Will Goodler  The Ship wherein the Capt was stayed at  Bellsound  This of the  Salutation  at the  Foreland  And the Capt meeting with store of  Whales  quickly made a Great Voyage and so sent for the  Salutation  to take in part of his TrainOyl By the way as they went to him meeting with CrossWinds the Master set Eight of his Men on Shore to kill some Venison in a place where there used to be good store These Men ta∣king with them a Brace of Dogs a Snap∣hance two Lances and a TniderBox went on Shore and that day they laid Fourteen Good Deer on the Ground And then being weary and the Night  coming on they betook themselves to Rest intending the next day to make an end of their Hunting and so to return to their Ship But the next day proved  Foggy  and there was much Ice between the Shore and the Ship and the Wind coming Southerly the Ship was fain to stand so far off into the Sea to be clear of the Ice that they lost the sight of her and the Weather growing thicker and thicker they thought fit to Hunt along the Shoar to  GreenHurbour  and there to stay aboard the Ship till their own Ship should come into the Port  In this Passage they killed Eight Deer more and so having laden their Shallop with Venison they kept on their course to  Green Harbour  But when they came thither they found to their great Asto∣nishment that the Ship was departed Being thus frustrated of their Expection and having but three days to the utter∣most expiration of their limited time for their departure out of that Country they thought it their best course to make all speed possible to  BellSound  to their Cap∣tain and lest delay should prove dan∣gerous they lightned their Shallop by heaving their Venison over board into into the Sea and so they hasted all they might and that night got halfway But  the dark  Fog  increasing they were forc'd to cove in a point of the Land till the next day at Noon At which time the Weather being clearer they hasted for∣ward but having no compass to direct their course by they wandred up and down so long till the Ships were depart∣ed This filled them with fear and astonishment knowing that neither Christian nor Heathen had ever Inha∣bited those desolate Climates Yea they had heard that the Merchants had en∣deavour'd with proffers of Great Re∣wards and of sufficient Furniture and Provision of all things necessary to hire some to undertake to Winter in those parts but could never meet with any that would adventure their Lives in so hazardous an Undertaking They had heard also that the Company of  Moscovy  Merchants had once procur'd the  Re∣prieve  of some  Malefactors  condemn'd to Death here in  England  unto whom they promised Pardon together with Re∣wards and Provision of Cloaths Victuals and all other Necessaries if they would stay one Winter there But when they came thither and took a view of the desolateness of the Place they conceiv'd such horror and fear in their Hearts that they chose rather to return for  England  and there to satisfie the Law with the loss of their Lives than to stay in so desolate and darksome a Country They remembred also a more terrible Example of Nine Good and Able Men left there formerly by the same Master that had now left them who all Died Miserably upon the place and whose Bodies were fearfully disfigur'd by the Savage Bears and Hungry Foxes which are the only Inhabitants of that comfort∣less Country All which made them like amazed Men to stand one looking upon another every one foreseeing the future Calamities both of himself and of his Fellows And that which much increas'd their horror was their want of all necessary Provision for the Life of Man having neither Clothes to keep them warm and for shift nor Food to prevent the Miseries of cruel Famine nor a House to shroud themselves from the extremity of Cold  But after a Space knowing that Delay in Extremity is the Mother of all Dan∣ger they began to conceive Hope out of the Depth of Despair and therefore they consulted together of the likeliest Course for their Preservation in that Place and resolv'd upon the Opportu∣nity of the next fair Weather to go to  GreenHarbour  to kill some Venison for part of their Winter Provision which accordingly they did but found not so many Dear as they expected yet the first Day they killed Seven and Four Bears to Boot which they also intend∣ed to eat The next Day they killed Six Deer more and as they returned they killed Six more and then the Weather proving foul and cold they la∣ded their Shallop with the Deer and Bears and finding another Shallop left there as usually they do from Year to Year they laded it with Greaves of Whales that had been boiled there that Year and so dividing themselves into those hallops they took the first Op∣portunity of returning to  BellSound  to their Tent where they intended to take up the rest for the Winter  But in their Passage the Night com∣ing on and the Wind blowing hard were forc'd to stay in the mid way at  Bottel Cove  for that Night There they fasten'd their Shallops one to another and casting out their Anchor they left them riding in the  Cove  But here again  for the trial of their Pa∣tience and to teach them to rely more upon upon God's Providence than than upon any outward Means of their own  this mischance  befel them The Wind blowing hard into the  Cove  and their Anchor coming home their Shallop sunk into the  Sea  and so wet all their Provision and some of it they found swimming up and down by the shoar The sight thereof won∣derfully troubled them to see the best part of their Provision the only hope of their Lives under God in danger either utterly to be lost or to be spoil'd by the  Seawater  for which they had taken such pains and run so many adventures in the getting of it and in this their Misery they saw but one remedy and that was a desperate one  viz  to turn into the high∣wrote  Sea  to their Shallops to save the re∣mainder of their Provisions now ready to be wash'd away by the Billows This they did and by main force drew the Shallops to the shore then they went a∣long by the  Seaside  to gather up such of their Provisions as were swimming up and down and when the Weather prov'd fair they went on to  Bellsound  where being arriv'd they took out their Provi∣vision and viewed the great Tent which was built of Timber and Boards and co∣vered with  Flemish  Tiles The use of it was for the  Coopers  to Work and Lodge in whilst they made Casks for the putting up of the TrainOyl and they resolved to  build another smaller Tent within that for their Habitations and accordingly taking down a lesser Tent that stood near to it wherein the Landmen lay whilst they made their Oyl they fetch'd their materials from thence both Boards Posts and Rafters and from the Chimnies of the Furnaces they took a thousand Bricks they found also four Hogsheads of Lime which mingled with sand from the shoar made good Mortar But the Weather was grown so extream cold that they were fain to make Fires on both sides to keep their Mortar from freezing then they raised a Wall of one Brick thickness against the inner Planks of the side of the Tent but by that time they had Wall'd sides of their House their Bricks fail'd so that they were forc'd to build the other sides of Boards which be∣ing nail'd on both sides the Posts they were hollow between which they fill'd up with Sand that made it so tite that the least breath of Air could not possibly annoy them The length of this Tent was foot and the breadth their Chimney was the breadth of a Deal∣board and foot high they Ciel'd it with Boards of or times double that no Wind could possibly get thro' The Door they made as close as they could  and lin'd it with a Bed that they found there which came over both the open∣ing and shutting of it they made no Windows having no light but what came thro' the Chimney then set they up Cabins quartering themselves two and two in a Cabin their Beds were the Deerskins dry'd which was a warm and comfortable Lodging for them in their Distress Their next care was for Firing and finding old Shallops which were unserviceable they brake them up and stow'd them over the beams of the great Tent to make it the warmer and to keep the Snow from driving thro' the Tiles into the Tent and by this time the cold increasing and scarce having any Day at all they stav'd some emp∣ty Cask and brake two old Coolers wherein they cool their Oyl provid∣ing whatsoever Firing they could with∣out prejudice to the next Years Voyage yet considering the small quantity of Fewel the extremity of Cold and the long time of their aboad they Husband∣ed it as thriftily as possibly they could  Having thus fitted every thing in the best manner they could on the of  Sept  looking out into the Sound they espy'd SeaHorses lying a Sleep on a piece of Ice whereupon taking up an  old harpingiron they hasten'd to them and first slew the old one and the the young and so bringing them ashore they flay'd them roasted and eat them Not long after they kill'd another but the Nights and cold Weather increasing on them and they viewing their Provi∣sion found it too small by half where∣upon they stinted themselves to one rea∣sonable Meal a day and agreed to fast  Wednesdays  and  Fridays  excepting from the Greaves and Fritters of the Whale which was a very loathsome Meat of which they allow'd themselves sufficient for their present Hunger at which Diet they continu'd for about Months  Having finished whatever they could invent for their Preservation they found that all their Clothes and Shoes were worn and torn to repair which they had this new device of Ropeyarn they made Thread and of Whalebones Needles to sow their Clothes withal But  Octob  the Nights being grown very long and the Cold so violent that all the Sea was Frozen over and they having now nothing to exercise their Minds upon were troubled with a thou∣sand imaginations Sometimes they be∣wail'd  their absence from their Wives and Children thinking what grief it would be to  them to hear of their miscarriage  then  they thought of their Parents and what a cutting corrosive it would be to them to hear of their untimely Deaths  c And being tormented in their Minds with Fear and Grief and pinched in their Bodies with Hunger and Cold the hideous Monster of Desperation presented his ugliest shape unto them But thinking it not best to give way to Grief and Fear th  y doubled their  Prayer  to  Al∣mighty God  for Strength and Patience in their Miseries by whose Assistance they shook off their former Thought and chear'd up themselves to use the best means for their preservation  Then for the preservation of their Venison and lengthening of their Fire∣ing they thought best to roast every day half a Deer and to stow it in Hogs∣heads which accordingly they did leav∣ing so much raw as would serve to roast every  Sabbath day  a quarter  c  And when this was over they began again to think of their ensuing Misery that in case God should give them Life yet they were to live as Banished Men from all Company and as if their Sorrows had been too little they presently found an increase of it for their WhaleFrit∣ters after they had been drench'd in the  Seawater  lying close together were grown mouldy and spoiled And again surveying their Bear and Venison they found that it would not afford them five Meals a Week whereupon they were fain to cut off one Meal more so that for three Months after four days in the Week they fed upon the unsavory moul∣dy WhaleFritters and the other three they feasted with Bear and Venison But beside the want of Meat they now be∣gan to want Light so that all their Meals were Suppers For from  Octob  to  Febr  the never saw the Sun so much as peep above the Horizon But th  Moon when not obscur'd with Clouds they always saw shining as bright as i  England  All which darksome time they could not certainly tell when it should be Day and when Night  In the beginning of this darkness they sought some means to preserve Light and finding a piece of SheetLead and some Oyl in the Coopers Tent and Ropeyarn they made a Lamp which they kept con∣tinually burning which was a great com∣fort to them in their extremity yet their Wants and Miseries were so many and great that sometimes they brake forth into impatient Speeches against the cau∣sers of them but then their Consciences a∣gain  minded them after their own  Evil deserts  and so they took it as a just Hand of God for their former wicked Lives or that God intended to make them Exam∣ples of his Mercy in their wonderful deli∣verance  Humbling themselves therefore un∣der the mighty Hand of God they prostrated themselves in Prayer two or three times a day  which course they constantly held all the time of their Misery  In the beginning of  January  as the days began to lengthen the cold began to strengthen which proceeded to that ex∣tremity that it raised blisters on their Flesh as if they had been burnt with Fire and if at any time they touched Iron it would stick to their Fingers like Bird∣lime If they went out of Doors to fetch in a little Water it would so pinch them that they were sore as if they had been beaten In the beginning of Winter with Pickaxes breaking the Ice daily they got some Water on the Seashore but after  January  they had none but Snowwater which they melted with  ot Irons which was their only Drink  ill  May  following  By the last of  Jan  the Days were or Hours long and then viewing their Victuals again they found that it would not last above six Weeks longer which  made them fear further Famine but  they had recourse to God  who they knew could supply them beyond their hopes  Looking out on a bright day they saw a great she Bear with her Cub coming toward their Tent whereupon Arming themselves with their Lances the went forth and staid her coming she soon cast her greedy Eye upon them and hoping to devour them hasted towards them But with their Lances they gave her such an hearty welcome that she tumbled upon the Ground biting the Snow for anger The Cub seeing this escap'd by flight The Weather was so extream Cold that they were fain pre∣sently to retire into the Tent and hav∣ing warmed themselves they drew in the dead Bear wherewith they Dined merrily and this Bear serv'd them days Only this mischance they had Eating her Liver it made their Skins peel off when she was spent they yet fear'd that their Venison would not hold out till the Fleet came out of  England  but God sent many Bears to their Tent by times at least whereof they kill'd One of which was exceeding great at least Foot High so that their Food in∣creasing they kept not themselves to such short Commons but oft Eat two or three  Meals a Day which much increased their strength  By this the chearful Days lengthen'd so fast that several sort of Fowl resorted thither  March  one of their Mastiffs went abroad which they never saw after upon the coming of the Fowls the Foxes which all Winter had kept their Bur∣roughts under the Rocks came abroad to seek for their livings whereupon they set up Traps which they baited with the Skins of these Fowls by which means they caught at times Foxes all which they roasted and found to be good Meat Then taking the Bearskins laying the Fleshy side upwards and making Springs of Whalebone the caught about sixty Fowls as big as Pigeons  May  The Weather began to be pret∣ty warm so that they went daily abroad to seek for Provision but nothing they could find for many Days till at length they met with abundance of  Willocks  Eggs of which the carried home thirty intending the next day to fetch a more but the Day proved so Cold that they could not stir out of their Tent The same Day there came two Ships of  Hull  into the Sound who knowing that some Men had been lest there the Year before being very desirous to know whe∣ther  they were Deat or Alive the Master Mann'd forth a Shallop to go as near the shore as they could and so over the Ice to the Tent When these Men came near the Tent they haled them with the usual word of the Sea crying  Hey  to which one of them in the Tent answered again  Hoe  which sudden answer almost amaz'd them all but perceiving them to be the very Men left there with joyful Hearts they embrac'd one another and so com∣ing into the Tent they shew'd the  Hul  Men  the Courtesie of the House giving them some Venison that was Roasted Months before and a cup of cold Water which for novelty sake they kindly ac∣cepted of them  After a little Discourse these Men resolved to leave their Tent and to go with them to their Ship where they were welcom'd after the heartiest and kindest  English  manner and so they staid with them till the  London  Fleet came which was three days after At which time they went aboard the Admiral in which Capt  Will Goodler  was who made them very welcome and gave order that they should have any thing that was in the Ship that might do them good he gave them Ap∣parel also to the value of Pounds So that after days refreshment they grew  all perfectly well But when some of them went to their own Master that had left them there he fell foul upon them calling them  Runaways  with other harsh terms far enough from the Civility of an honest Man Thus they continu'd in the Fleet until  Aug  at which time with joyful Hearts they set Sail through the foaming Ocean and though sometimes crossed with contrary Winds yet at last they came safely to an Anchor in the Ri∣ver  Thames  and the  Muscovy Merchants  dealt very well by them  The Names of these Men were  Will Fakely  Gunner  Edw Pelham  GunnersMate that wrote this Story  Joh Wise  and  Rob Goodfellow  Seamen  Tho Ayers  Whalecutter  Hen Bet  Cooper  John Dawns  and  Rich Kellet  Landmen  Greenland  is a Country that lies very far Northward in Degrees and Mi∣nutes it's wonderful Mountainous which Mountains are all the Year long cover'd with Ice and Snow The Plains in part are bare in Summer But there grows neither Tree nor Herb in it except  Scur∣veygrass  and  Sorrel  The Sea is as barren as the Land affording no Fish but Whales Seahorses Seals and some few small Fishes  In  June  the  Peachtree  of  Lon∣don  a small Vessel of the Burthen of about  Tons  Edw Dixon  Master came into the  Downs  bound for  Guinny  intending there to take in  Negroes  and to transport them to the  Barbadoes  and from thence to come for  London  where  John Watts  the Son of  John Watts  of  Eltham  in the County of  Kent  Chirurgeon Shipt him∣self with the consent of  Rich Watts  pub∣lick Notary of  D  al  little dreading that his Nephew being then not above Years old should meet with such a cala∣mitous Accident The Ship had not been long in the  Downs  but a fair Gale pre∣senting they suddenly hoisted Sail God's Providence seeming to fill their Sails with Prosperous Success the 'first place they touch'd at was the  Gold Coast  where they staid not long but Sail'd to old  Calabar  in the  Bith  of  Guinny  They enter'd a Ri∣ver call'd the  Cross River  into  Pirats  Island After they had taken in their  Negroes  and ready to Sail their Anchor being a Peek the Master calls up the  Boatswain  and Men more whereof the Relater was one and commands them to look out the Cop∣per Bars that were left and carry them on Shore to try if they could sell them the  Boatswain  with his small Company de∣sired that they might have Arms with them not believing the report of some that inform'd them they were a harmless  and innocent People They took with them three Muskets and a Pistol and so Row'd towards the Shore but not far from it unhappily our Match fell into the Water and the Ship being fall'n down from that narrow part of the River near∣er the Sea quite out of sight we were consulting what should be safest for us to do we were not willing to precipitate our own Ruin and were also asham'd to re∣turn to our Ship before we had dispatch'd what we were commanded to at length the  Boatswain  commanded the Relater  John Watts  on shore to the first House to light our Match which we recover'd out of the Water after it was extinct which he readily obey'd But before he was Rods from the Waterside he was seiz'd on by Black or rather Tawnymoors and by them haled above half a Mile up into the Country and thrown with great violence upon his Belly and so compell'd to lie till they stript him and more Company coming to them they were so eager for his poor Canvas Apparel that some they tore off others they cut off and with that several pieces of his Flesh to this intolerable pain with these Rags they made little Childrens Aprons to co∣ver their Privities Linnen and Woollen being scarce there The  Boatswain  see∣ing  this  Joh Watts  was thus carried away was resolv'd with his other two Compa∣nions to have him again or else to ven∣ture all their Lives for him They Arm themselves but whilst they were con∣sulting what to do whether to venture on shore or not of a sudden they were beset with about Men in several Ca∣noes but they valianly maintain'd their Boat about the space of Hours for af∣ter of their Muskets were discharg'd they defended themselves with their Oars and Boathooks The  Boatswain  re∣ceiv'd a mortal Wound in his Groin and fell down in the Boat the other two ad∣ventur'd in the River endeavouring by Swimming to escape the merciless Hands of cruel Infidels but the  Negroes  with their swift Canoes soon overtook them and brought them on shore to the place where the Relater was The  Negroes  took the  Boatswain  out of the Ships Boat and instead of endeavouring at all to pre∣serve the Life which remain'd in him immediately they rob'd him of it one of them with a keen weapon cutting off his Head before his Companions Faces and then they prepare for their rare Ban∣quet while he was yet reeking in his Blood they in a barbarous manner cut∣ting off pieces of Flesh from off his But∣tocks  and his Thighs and his Arms and Shoulders and broil'd them on the Coals and with a great deal of impatience ea∣gerly eat it before our Faces to our great astonishment About days after one of the Company fell Sick and instead of being Physicians to cure him they were his Butchers to Murder him They served him as they did the  Boatswain  cut off his Head and broil'd and eat up his Flesh and rejoic'd exceedingly at this rich Banquet About days after the third fell Sick whom they served in the same manner  This was no small cause of Sorrow to the Relater the thoughts of their Inhu∣man and Barbarous actions sometimes surrounded him with Fears and Sorrows hourly expecting to taste of the said Cru∣elty Death did not seem so terrible to him as the violent manner of it being left now alone in a strange Country de∣stitute of Friends or Acquaintance or any thing that might keep up his Spirits Die he would fain but not by the Hands of Infidels and barbarous Monsters But the great God that is most compassionate in the greatest extremities had pity on him and notwithastnding the alteration of the Climate and the want of Clothes and the strangeness of his Food which  was only Herbs he continu'd in good Health and had time enough to lament their direful Providence The Natives who were daily expecting another Ban∣quet met with a disappointment either their Cuostms or the overruling Power of God would not suffer them to destroy him he continuing still in Health There∣fore they resolve to sell him his  Arannia  or Master was pretty free to Discourse him which the Relator was capable of being about Years before in the  WestIndies  where he had learn'd the  Tata  Lan∣guage which is easily attain'd being com∣prehended in a very few words and all the  Negroes  speak it He began to Dis∣course his Master to know  the reason of their Cruelty  who told him that  he should rest himself contented who if he were not Sick should not have his Head cut off  In the Boat which in the beginning they took with them was a Musket sav'd of the which was not discharg'd which his Ma∣ster some time after he had been with him brought to him to know  the use of it  he endeavour'd as much as he could to make him apprehend the use of it but still they profest their ignorance but they commanded and threaten'd him to shew the use of it The fear of his Ma∣ster's Displeasure and their Inhumanity  caused him to shoot it off but the  Negroes  which expected some delightful thing were frustrated and at the sudden noise and flash of Fire which they very much dread ran from him and were greatly affrighted but quickly after hearing no more of that noise they came up to him again and commanded him to  do the like  He told them  he had not Powder which was the cause of the noise  but this would not satisfie these  Barbarians  He not being able to answer their expectati∣on they concluded he was not willing they proceed to threaten him and were about to Murder him had not his Master rescu'd him Upon Discourse after with this  Arannia  or Master he began to under∣stand the reason of their barbarous deal∣ing with him and his Friends he telling him  that naturally the People were Civil and simply Honest but if provoked full of Revenge  and that  this Cruelty was occasion'd by some unhandsome action of carrying a Native away without their leave about a Year before they resolving if any came ashore they should never go off alive  He had not been above Weeks in the Country but his Master presented him to his King whose Name was  E fnme  King of the  Blackamoors  who immediately gave him to his Daugh∣ter whose Name was  Onijah  and when  the King went abroad he attended him also as his Page throughout the whole Circuit of his Dominions which was not above Miles yet boasting extreamly of his Power and Strength but glorying exceedingly that he had a  White  to attend him whom he employ'd to carry his Bow and Arrows at several places remote from the Seaside the People would run away from him for fear others would fall down and seem to Worship him and and use those actions as they do to their Gods Their Pregress was never so long but they could return home at Night but never without a handsome load of a Cup of the Creature During all the time of the Relater's servitude there he never knew him go abroad and come home Sober They drink of the best  PalmWine  and another sort of strong Liquor call'd  Penrore  The Relater quickly knew how to humour this profound Prince and if any of the Natives abus'd him upon his complaint he had redress as once by striving with a  Negroe  his Arm was broke which by Providence more than Skill was set again After some Months the King of  Caal nanch  whose name was  Efn mancha  hearing of this beautiful  White  courted his Neighbour Prince that he would sell him to him at length they  struck a bargain and the Relator was sold for  a Cow and a Goat  this King was a very sober and moderate Person free from Treacheries and Mischiefs that the other was subject unto and he would of∣ten Discourse the Relater and ask him of  his King and Country  and  if his Kingdoms and Dominions were as big as his  which were not above Miles in length and and in breadth He told him as much as his Understanding and Years made him capable of keeping still in the bounds of Modesty and yet relating as much as pos∣sible to the  Honour and Dignity of his Sove∣raign  first informing him of  the greatness of one of his Kingdoms the several Shires and Coun∣ties it contained with the number of its Cities Towns and Castles and the strength of each the infinite number of Inhabitants and valour of his Subjects  One of these Kingdoms was enough to amaze sufficiently this petty Governour that he need not to mention any more of his Majesties Glory and Dig∣nity It put him in to such a profound consternation that he resolved to find out some way to tender his Respects to this mighty Prince and no way could he find so convenient as to tell the Relater that  if he could find but a passage he would let him go to  England  to tell his Majesty of the great Favour and Respect he had for him  This did not a little rejoice our  Englishman  Withal the King told him that  he would send him a Present which should be two Cabareets or Goats  which they do va∣lue at a very high rate the King having not above or He tells the King that  the K of  England  had many thousands of his Subjects that were under the Degree of Genlemen which had a thousand of Sheep a∣piece the Flesh of which they valu'd at a very much higher rate than Goats  Tho' our  English man  liv'd very handsomely with this  Efn mancha  King of the  Calananch  yet his desires and his hopes were still for his Native Country At length he ob∣tain'd a Promise from his King that  the first  English  Ship that came into that Road should have liberty to Release or Purchase him  this very much rejoic'd his Heart Now he thought ev'ry day a year till he could hear of or see some  English  Ship arriv'd Many times when he was alone his Heart would be oppress'd with Sighs and Sob∣bings when he thought of his Relations and the comfortable Society that they had together that it should be his sad Lot to be Captivated amongst barbarous Infidels Oftentimes did he walk down to the Seaside sometimes with Hopes sometimes with Fear earnestly expecting the Wind of God's Providence to blow in  some  English  Ship thither His often re∣course to the Seaside was discern'd by one  Jaga  a Wizard and the chiefest in or Kingdoms thereabouts they are Persons that the Natives give very much credit to and on any difficult Occasion run to them for satisfaction The famous  Delphiān Oracle  was never had in greater Adoration than the Prophetical Speeches of these  Moorish  Wizards Tho' they have infinite numbers of them in every place yet this  Jaga  had the most renown a∣mongst them and one day he comes to him and very kindly ask'd him  Why he so very often frequented that place  He told him  To see if he could discover any  English  Vessel to come in there  But he being not acquainted with his great Fame askt him  When he did belive there would one come in  Not that he was willing to give credit to any of their Divinations but supposing that he thereby should please him and answer his expectation  Ja ga  immedi∣ately told him  That the    day after an  English  Ship should come into the Road  Then he askt him  Whether that Ship should carry him away  To which he answer'd doubt∣fully but told him  That he should be offer'd to the Master of the Ship that they would not agree that he should come to Shore again and he should not be Sold but in a very  short time after he should die for Grief  These Days seem'd very long and tedious many a look did he cast on the Sea with an aking Heart The Day he went to the highest Hill thereabout but to no purpose for he could discover no Ship the next Morning he went again or times but saw none about or Hours after came running into  Efnmancha  some of the  Moors  and told him there was a Canoe coming so they call'd our Ships at which our  Englishman  heartily rejoic'd hoping then to be Releas'd forth∣with yet durst not shew his joy for fear of Punishment or of Death for tho' he liv'd better now than with his first Ma∣ster yet his Service was far worse than the Slaves in  Turkey  and their Diet worse than DogsMeat therefore had he cause enough of inward Joy the Ship came immediately in and he highs away pre∣sently to  Jaga  to know if it were an  English  Ship who resolv'd him that it was it happen'd to be the St  Maloes  Merchant Capt  Royden  Commander who hasten'd to dispatch his Business took in his  Negroes  and was ready to Sail and our  English man  heard never a word what should become of him the King never offering to sell him this put him on a resolution to en∣deavour to make an escape and to that  end had prepar'd a piece of Timber which he had drawn near the Waterside on which he intended to paddle to the Ship which then lay about a League from the shore Just by the Seaside as he was a∣bout to Launch his little floating Stick he espy'd a great  Aligator  which will de∣vour a Man at a Mouthful this made him alter his Resolution and resolve ra∣ther to live with Inhuman Infidels than to throw himself into so imminent a dan∣ger which would have been little less than Selfmurder But the next day which I may call a day of  Jubilee  Al∣mighty God open'd the Heart of the King to let the poor  English man  go He sent him in a  Canoe  plac'd between a  Negroe's  Legs with some others to guide this small Vessel for fear he should leap overboard and Swim to the Ship At a distance from the Ship he Hal'd her in the  English  Tongue which was no small cause of ad∣miration to those on Board to hear an  English  Tongue out of their  Canoes  The  Negroes  gave him leave to stand up and shew himself to the Captain to whom he gave an Account  how four were left there and only he preserv'd  It was a pretty while before they could strike a Bargain tho' the Captain was resolv'd not to leave him behind Several times the  Negroes  padled away with their  Canoe  resolving not to part with him but what with his entreaties and promises he persuaded them to the Ship again and they deli∣ver'd him on Board for Copper Bars and Iron Bars each Copper Bar being a∣bout the bigness of a Youth's little Fin∣ger the Iron Bars a little bigger Now were his Joys compleated he thought himself as it were  caught up into the third Heavens  he could hardly perswade him∣self but it was a Dream or Vision and that he did not really see  English  Faces or embrace  English  Bodies It was some time before he could throw himself at the Captains Feet and acknowledge his in∣finite cause of Joy in himself and  thank∣fulness to him for his Deliverance from such a severe Captivity  that  he that lately was a Slave to Infidels that worship they know not what should now see the Faces of Christians and join with them in Worshipping the true God  and to him first he offer'd up the Sacrifice of hearty Thanksgiving that had sent his Angel to redeem him from so cruel a Bondage When he came on Board his Hair was very Long and his Skin Tawny  Malatto  like having gone Naked all the time he was there and fre∣quently anointing himself with  Palm Oyl  he look'd like a  TawnyMoor  but immedi∣ately  the Seamen aboard with Christianlike Hearts Apparell'd him The Master commanded to hoist Sail and having a fair Wind they Sail'd to  Barbadoes  where Capt  Royden  was to tarry some time but the Relator earnestly desiring to go to his Native Country and his Ralations got passage to the  Downs  in the  Katherine  of  London  Capt  South  Commander which through God's Goodness in a few Weeks arriv'd in the  Downs  where the Relater was put on shore to his Uncle Mr  Rich Watts  of  Deal  to his great Joy and Satis∣faction who took this Relation from his own Mouth  The Relation of Dr  William Johnson  con∣cerning a most Remarkable  SeaDeliver∣ance  in his own words  We went aboard from  Harwich  on  Michaelmasday  Sept ▪ in the  William  and  John  of  Ipswich Daniel Morgan  Master and having a fair Wind we set Sail I being Seasick went to Bed but about a Clock in the Afternoon the Master of the Ship came into our Cabin with more haste than he was wont which made me ask him  whether all was well  Who like a tenderhearted Man who is loath to tell his Dying Friend that he is so nigh his end reply'd  all is well  yet  when I saw him shift himself with such haste I rose from my Bed and crawl'd upon the Deck where I saw a sad specta∣cle the Ship having sprang a Leak or rather a Plank was ready to sink upon which every Man was affrighted  one was at his Prayer another wringing his Hands a third his Eyes shedding of Tears  when he had no need of more Saltwater but af∣ter this they fell to Work but were bu∣sie in doing nothing The Master's Mate who went to search the Leak told us with a sad Countenance trembling Hands gnashing of Teeth a quivering Tongue and words half spoken  That the Leak could not be stopt and the Water came in so fast upon us that we must perish in this noment  Upon which we presently cast out our Longboat and shot off or Guns to another Ship who came out with us to come to our Relief then with some dif∣ficulty we all got into the Boat and God be thanked came clear of the Ship whose Sails now lay flat upon the Water and now we were rowing we know not whi∣ther for the other Ship came not to our Relief which made us have hard thoughts of them without cause for we understood that both the Ship and all the Men pe∣rished in the same hour Now were we without all hope for it blew half a Storm  and we were in a small Vessel many Leagues from the shore without Com∣pass or Provision to sustain us being starv'd likewise with Cold as well as for want of Victuals having nothing in our Boat but a small Kettle which serv'd to cast out the water and Bags of Pieces of Eight of Pound Serling which would neither feed us nor keep us warm in this distress we went to  Prayers  and it pleased God to hear us and send a Ship to us even in the moment of Death which we endeavour'd to come to and he likewise to us but the Storm was so great we could not reach one another tho' when it was dark he hung out a Light and we to let him know we were alive order'd that when a wave took us up we should give a great shout which we did so loud that  I helieve our Cry was heard to Heaven  for by God's miraculous Assistance we got near the Ship and soon after all safe into it the next day it blew fair for  Norway  whither we were bound and about at Noon we saw the Coast which being ragged and full of Rocks we resolv'd to stay till next Morn∣ing before we went in and then sat down to Meat and Eat very heartily being kindly entertain'd by the honest  Norwe∣gian  about ten a Clock at Night we laid  us down to rest after having pray'd and set our Watch but immediately this our second Ship ran with full Sails upon a Rock and gave so great a Crack as was able to awake the most dead asleep a∣mong us and the Mariners cry'd out  Mercy Mercy  it pleased God that the Ship struck it self so fast in the clift of the Rock that the former part of her stood firm but breaking in the Storm one of the Seamen leaped from the Bow of the Ship upon the Rock with a Rope in his Hand which was fasten'd to one of our Masts and held it with so stiff a Hand that another slipt down by it and so all our Company that escaped being in Number came safe to the Rock I was the last that came down the Ship that way for in that very moment she gave way which the Master perceiving who was still aboard made lamentable moan to us to help him which we en∣deavour'd to the utmost but the Ship broke and sunk immediately there was this good Man and four of the Mariners drowned I saw the Master with a Light∣in his Hand fall into the Sea the sad∣dest sight that I ever yet beheld in this World and that which pierced my Soul to see him that saved our Lives lose his own Now were we in the Dark upon  the Rock but knew not where our Feet being cut upon the sharp Stones At length we happen'd of a hole in the Rock which which was a warm shelter against the Wind and when Morning came where we could see no Land only had a glimps of the Coast of  Norway  at a great di∣stance We grew Hungry but had no∣thing to Fish with but our Arms with which we drew up some small Muscles and they we eat heartily but we burnt with thirst and  I would have given all I had for a Draught of fresh Water  which would have been more welcome than the Gold of  Ophir  tho' nothing is so mean in our esteem but we were forc'd to drink  Saltwater  which increased our Thirst we now saw a Ship coming towards us with full Sails and we  wav'd our Hats at them  but they went off and never came near us we betook our selves to our old Remedy  Prayers  the  Danes  first singing one of  Luther  's  Psalms  fell to their  Prayers  and I Pray'd as long as I was able to speak and then laid my self down on the Rock thinking I should rise no more in this World But I overheard one of the Seamen say  Let us make a Raft and venture to Sea I had rather be Drown'd than lie here to be Starv'd  They all concluded of it tho' dangerous and the Sea having fal∣len  from the Rock had left our Sails Masts and Anchors with part of the Ship thereon wherewith they soon made a slight Boat and it being a great calm the rest past through the Beaches with Men in it and had it touch'd only on them they would have rent it in pieces however through God's Goodness they arrived safe in  Norway  and return'd with several Boats so that we came all of us once more to Land and were entertain'd at an honest  Lutheran  Parson's House where after we had continu'd for some Days with little Money and much Thanks we parted and came to  Frederick Stadt  where the People ran after us in the Streets and with compassionate Eyes  gave us what we wanted without asking  from whence we went to  Oftersondt  and there went aboard an  English  Ship we had not been above or hours at Sea but there was a sad distraction the Mariners again crying for  Mercy Mercy  for we had al∣most fallen soul on a Rock under Water which we did not spie till we were upon it but by the Mercy of God we Sail'd close by it and yet escaped it the least touch of it had been our ruine about noon we came clear of all the Rocks on the Coast of  Norway  and were Sailing for  England  with a fair Gale of Wind But  in this prosperity another sad ancident befel us this third Ship sprang a leak and began to swim within as well as with∣out and we had no way to relieve our selves but pumping for the Leak could not be found which we did day and night for four or five days together when it pleased God we came safe though in a great deal of danger because of our rotten Ship into  Yarmouth  Road for the wind being very high had like to have driven us upon a  Scotch  Vessel who cry∣ed out as well as we but we happily mist him and so safely arrived in  Yarmouth  Town through the wonderful mercy of God  Deus Nobiscum  The great Dangers and Merciful Deliver∣ances of  William Okely  and his Company from Slavery in a Canvas Boat  c  In the Year We took Ship at  Gravesend  in the  Mary  of  London  Mr  Boarder  Master bound for the Isle of  Pro∣vidence  in the  WestIndies  five weeks we  ay in the  Downs  waiting for a wind and then we set Sail and came to an Anchor near the Isle of  Wight  but by this time all the Beer in our Ship stunk and we were forc'd to throw it overboard and so take in Vinegar to mix with Water for our Voyage the next Lords day we set Sail  again and coming between the Island and the main Land we stuck fast in th  Sands but the Tide coming in heave  us off the sixth day after our setting Sa  from the Isle of  Wight  we discovered thre  Turks  men of War who chased us and a  break of day boarded and took us hav¦ing kept us close Prisoners at Sea at th  end of five or six Weeks they brough  us to  Algiers  where I was sold for a slay the first Market day to a Patron wh  told me  I must allow him two Dollars Month and live ashore where I would an  get it where I could  though I knew no  where to levy the least Mite of it Wa  dring up and down I met with an  En¦glishman  in his little Shop  who Trade with Tobacco and a few other things  I be¦came his Partner with a little Money had reserved and a small modicum m  Patron had allowed me for my stock Here I got money and hired a Cella  where I laid up some other of my Good when weary of my slavery I formed design for my Liberty and communi¦cated it to  John Anthony  Carpenter  Wi  Adams  Bricklayer  John Jephs  Seaman  John  a Carpenter and two others me  of able Bodies and useful in the intende  project which was to contrive the Mo  del of a Boat which being formed i  parcels and afterwards put together might be the means of our escape They approved the Proposal and in my Cel∣lar we began to work we provided first a piece of Timber of twelve foot long to make the Keel but because it was impossible to convey it of that length out of the City but it must be seen and suspected we therefore cut it in two pieces and fitted it for jointing just at the middle and then we provided Ribs af∣ter which we made the Boat Watertight and because Boards would require much hammering and that noise was like to betray us we bought as much strong Canvas as would cover our Boat twice over upon the Convex of the Carine we provided also as much  Pitch Tar  and  Tallow  as would serve to make it a kind of Tarpawling Cerecloth to swaddle the Naked Body of our Infant Boat of two Pipe staves sawed at the Corners we made two things to serve for Oars and for our Provision we had a little Bread and two Leather Bottles full of fresh Water we also remembred to buy as much Canvas as would serve for a Sail we carried out these in parts and parcels fitted them together in the Valley about half a mile from the Sea whither Four of our Company carried the Boat on  their Shoulders and the rest followed them At the Seaside we stript put our Clothes into the Boat and carried it and them as far into the Sea as we could wade and then all seven got into the Boat but finding she was over laden two of the Seamen were content to stay on shore having bid them farewel we lanched out  June  The Bill of Lading was  John Anthony Will Adams John Jephs John  the Carpenter and  Will Okely  Four of us wrought continually at the Oar the Fisth was to free the Boat of that Water which by degrees leaked through our Canvas our Bread was soon spoiled with the soaking in the Saltwa∣ter our Freshwater stunk of the Tan∣ned Skin and  Owze  yet we complained not three days with good Husbandry our Bread lasted us but then  Pale Famine star'd us in the Face Water  indeed we might have but  it must be Salt out of the Sea  or  that which had been strain'd through our own Bodies  and that we chose of the two but we must not have that after a while unless we would accept of the other first and the misery was that did not asswage our Thirst but inerease it the Wind too for some time was full against us but God rebuked it and made it our Friend a second inconvenience was that our  Labour was without intermission and a third the extremity of the Heat by day the season raging hot the begin∣ning of  July  and we wanted freshwater to cool the Heat  our Labour made it insup∣portable to our Bodies and our little hope made it as grievous to our Souls  one help we had a poor one he that emptied the Boat threw the Water on the Bodies of the other to cool them but our Bodies thus scorched and cooled rose up in Bli∣sters all over  great pain we felt great dan∣gers we were in great Miseries we indur'd great wants we were under  and had nothing but a little Hope Food and Strength If any Ask  by what Directions we steered our course to Mayorck  whither we design'd to go  For the day a Pocket Dial did supply the place of a Compass by Night the Stars when they appear'd and when not we gues∣sed our way by the the motion of the Clouds  Four Days and Nights were we in this woful plight on the fifth all hope that we should be sav'd was perish'd so that we left off our Labour because we had no strength left only emptied the Boat of Water but then God sent us some Relief for as we lay hulling up and down we discover'd  Tortoise  not far from us asleep in the Sea had  Drake  discover'd the  Spanish  Fleet he could not have more  Rejoyc'd we took up our Oars silently rowed to our Prey took it into the Boat with Great Triumph we cut off her Head and let her Bleed into a Pot we drank the Blood eat the Liver and sucked the Flesh it wonderfully refreshed our Spi∣rits and we picked up some crumbs of Hope about Noon we thought we dis∣cover'd Land it's impossible to express the joy of our raised Souls at this appre∣hension we Wrought hard and after further Labour were fully satisfy'd that it was Land and proved to be  Mayork  which we kept within sight of all day  July  the th about Ten at Night we came under the Island and crept as near the Shore as we could or durst till we found a convenient place where we might thrust in our  Weatherbeaten Boat  when we were come to Land we were not in∣sensible of our deliverance but though we had escap'd the Sea we might die at Land We had no Food since we eat the Liver and drank the Blood of the Tor∣toise therefore  John Anthony  and my self were sent out to Scout abroad for  FreshWater  because we spake some  Spanish  We came to a WatchTower of the  Spa∣niards  spake to him on the Watch told him our Condition earnestly begged some  FreshWater  and some  Bread  he  threw us down and  old mouldy Cake  but so long as it was a Cake Hunger did not consider its Mouldiness then he direct∣ed us to  FreshWater  which was hard by We stood not telling of Stories we re∣membred our Brethren left with our Boat and observing the Centinel's Directions came to a Well where there was a Pot with strings to draw with we drank a little Water and eat a bit of our Cake but the passage was so disused that we had much ado to force our Throats to re∣lieve our clamorous Stomachs we re∣turn to our Boat and acquaint them with the Good Successes of our Embassy and all prepare to make to the  Well  so tying our Boat as fast as we could to the shore we left her to Mercy N  w w  are at the  Well  which hath  Water  therein and we have something to draw with but  God must give us a Throat to swallow  for  Will Adams  attempting to drink after many Essays was not able to swallow it but still the Water return'd so that he sunk down to the ground Fainting saying  I am a Dead Man  But after much stri∣ving he took a little so refreshed with our Cake and Water we lay by the Well side till the Morning when it was clear day we again went to the  Watch∣man  intreating him  to direct us the ready  way to the next House or Town  wher  we might find Relief he civilly pointed to us to one about Two Mile off and long it was ere our Blistering Feet could overcome the tediousness o  that little way When we came thither the honest  Farmer  moved with our Rela¦tion sent us  Bread  and  Water  and  Olives  and seeing us  Thankful Beggars  inlarge  his Civility to us called us into his House and gave good warm  Bean Pottage  which seem'd to me the most pleasant Food that ever I eat in my Life then we ad∣vanced to the City of  Mayorck  about Te  Miles from that place that Night we lay by a  Well side  and in the Morning we e  ed the Suburbs the  ViceRoy  was informed of us and  we were com∣manded to appear before him  who after he had Examin'd us and heard our Story order'd we should be maintain'd at his own Cost till we could have Passage to our own Country But our  English  Ships seldom Trading thither we Petition'd the  ViceRoy  for Passage in the King of  Spain  's Gallies which were in the Road bound for  Alicant  which he graciously granted us after some other Troubles we met with contrary Winds and it was five Weeks ere we could reach the  Downs  where we arriv'd in  Sept  The  Commader of the Ship was Capt  Smith  of  Rotherhithe  Mr  Thomas Saunders  my Wives Brother being in  Mayorck  not long after we came from thence saw our Boat hung for a Monument upon the side of Great Church there and Mr  Robert Hales  was there and assures me that he saw the Naked Ribs and Skeleton of it then hanging in the same place  Wanly  's Hist  Man  p  The Merciful Preservation and Deliverance of Capt  Blose  and his ships Company who were Cast away in an Island of Ice near  Russia  this present year    October  the th We came from  Archangel  in  Russia  in the  Riga  Merchant Burthen Tuns Guns  Samuel Blose  Commander The th we had the Wind at  North West  by  West  we plied to Wind∣ward and it blew very hard the th we took two  Reefs  in our  Topsails  the th we took in our  Topsails  and  Reefe  Costs  the th about One in the Morn∣ing we  Sprung a Leak  in so much that we were forced to set both our Pumps to Work and bear away before the Wind yet still the Water increased and the th we cut our  MainSail  from the  Yard  and let him fly overboard the Weather being so excessive thick by reason of the  extraordinary much Snow that then fell that we could not see the Land nor any place where we could run our Ship A∣shore to save our Lives The in the Mor∣ning about One of the Clock by For∣tune unexpected of us before we saw any Land we struck upon an Island called by the  Russes Mussoves  lying in the  Missen Gulf  which by the Miraculous hand of God  we light on and were all  got∣ten well ashore for as God of his wonder∣ful goodness so order'd it we struck about High Water and as the Water fell away our Ship dryed so that we got safe to Land without any harm and if it had pleased God we happen'd ever so little either to one side or the other we should have all perish'd among the Islands of Ice When we got all ashore we made us a  Tent  and when it was Day looking about us saw something like  Houses  so our  Captain  and a  Dutch Merchant  Passenger that we had on Board of our Ship and our  Doctor  went to see what they were thinking to find some Inhabitants but they could find none then we went Aboard our Ship and got all our  Beef  ashore that we could find about  One hundred Weight  of  Bisket Bread  which was all the  Bread  we could find then we Calculated that our  Beef  at  Four Pieces  a day would serve  us till the middle of  May  and every Man  one Bisket  a Day but that would last but a small time Besides we got ashore Three Boxes of  Candles  which was a great comfort to us in our necessity by reason we had not above  Three hours Day  Then we got all our things we had saved to the House that we saw and going a∣bout discover'd a great many Houses and we went to them to see what we could find expecting to see some People but there was none but  empty Cask  so we came home to the place that we had car∣ried our things to again but as God would have it just against the House that we had taken for our Habitation in the Snow we saw  Two Cask  and we went and found them both full of  Rye Meal  which was a Joy beyond measure to us in our Extremity and then we found another  Cask  with a  KneadingTub  in it  Decem  the First the  Dutch Merchant  and Four more of our hands went out and took a  Compass  and  Provision  with them upon Discovery hoping to see some bo∣dy to speak to that we might know where we were but they could find no Inha∣bitants the Course they steered was  S E  but when they came to turn back their  Compass  unhung and they not mind∣ing it went up and down a long time  and at length came to the same place where they were when they first turned back then they looked more earnestly upon their  Compass  and found it unhung they hung it and came the direct way home again but when they came in sight of a House that was about Two Miles off of our House the  Merchant  and one more Travelling better than the o∣ther Three went before and promis'd them to make a Fire against they came but the Weather being so severe they were not able to come along but were Starved with the Cold before they got up to us So the Lord of his great Mer∣cy made Provision for us until the First of  March  it being a  Sabbathday  and we at our Devotion one of our Boys being at another House Broiling of our Victu∣als saw some Men upon the Island he fell down being much surpriz'd but soon got up again and run and told us up∣on which we left our  Prayers  and run to see what they were our  Merchant  could speak the  Language  which was the preservation of all our Lives for other∣ways they would have Murther'd us for  breaking down  their  Houses  and  Eating  their  Provisions  that we found upon the Island for they would not be perswaded but we were  Pirats  and  Robbers  by reason that  we were Building of a  Small Vessel  for our own Security to carry us to the Main when the Ice broke up but our  Merchant  speaking their  Language  persuaded them and promised them to make them Satis∣faction for what Damage we had done them for we broke down  Two  of their Houses for  Firing  So they  turned us out of our Houses  and took our  Meal  from us The Men that came over were in Num∣ber Ten Men in a Boat they came there to kill  Seales  They asked us  what we had seen  We told them  Nothing but Two Ravens  They made very strange of it and would not believe it For they told us  That none of them live there but Six Weeks in the Year whether they catch Fish or not the Island was so Haunted  Soon after the  Russians  came there that  Man  that saved his Life and got well home with the  Merchant  when the other Three were Starved with the Cold Died which made Four that were Dead our Com∣pliment at first was but then we had but Living Then our  Merchant  went to the  Russians  and desired them to put us over and he would satisfie them for it They granted we should have  Six Boats  and  Men  to Drag us over the  Ice  for it was  Seven Leagues  from the  Main  and all full of  Islands of Ice  between  insomuch that they were hours com∣ing over when they came upon the said Island But it pleased the Lord so to or∣der it that after they had dragg'd us o∣ver Two small Islands of Ice that as God parted the  RedSea  for the  Children of Isra∣el  to pass through so he parted the  Ice  from us insomuch that we got over in  Six hours  time which the  Russians  told us was never so before But when we came over we lay where there were Men a  Fishing  The first Night and the next Morning we hired  Sledges  to drag us to some place Inhabited The Beasts that dragg'd the Sledges along they call  Roeys  they are like Deer but larger We were forc'd to be Dragg'd we could not Travel our Limbs were so disabled with the Cold be∣fore we got off the aforesaid Island be∣sides the  Snow  was of such a vast thickness and so hard  Frozen  that we could find no Path if we could Travel never so well if the  Shamake    as they call them had not shown us the way the first Night of our Journey upon the Sledges our  Carpenters Mate  died so we made a Hole in the Snow and put him in and left him Then our  Captain  and the  Merchant  and the  Doctor  being but single in a Sledge and we near double went faster than us to the next Town to provide  Victuals  and fresh  Sledges  for us against we came and when we came to that Town we got Sledges that had Horses to draw them along so we Rid Night and Day till we came to  Archangel  the Third day of our Travels another of our Men Died and the th day another the former we Buryed in the  Ground  be∣cause we were nigh a Town but the other we Buryed in the  Snow  So that when we came to  Archangel  out of our Men we had but left  March  the th we came off the aforesaid Island and we Tra∣vell'd Night and Day except the first Night until the th of the same Month Two days after we came to  Archangel  we lost another Man At  Archangel  our Cap∣tain got  Stoves  for us to inhabit in and sent us  Provision  where we remain'd till the th day of  June  when there came in Six Sail of  Hollanders  being the First that came that year who divided us amongst them and brought us to  Greenland  and from thence some of us were brought to  Holland  and some to  Hamborough  from whence of us got Passage to  England  where we Arriv'd the of  Nov  Two went to the  Straits  and our  Dutch Merchant  tarried in  Holland  This Account is given by  Francis Lee  who was Boatswain of the Ship and Attested by others now Living in  London  THE  Seaman  's  Preacher  OR SeaDangers and Deliverances Improv'd in a SERMON  Acts    And being exceedingly tossed with a Tem∣pest the next day they lightned the Ship    And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the Ship    And when neither Sun nor Stars appear∣ed and no small Tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away  IN this Chapter we have a full Narra∣tive of  Paul  's Voyage to  Rome  in all the circumstances of it it seems  Paul  kept a  Journal  and so Recorded this memora∣ble  Voyage  for the use of succeeding Ge∣nerations We have the  Occasion  of his Voyage  viz Paul  being then a  Sufferer  and a  Prisoner  he appeals to  Caesar  and so is sent to  Rome  and there bears a faithful Testimony for  Jesus Christ    vers  We have the  Dangers  that occurred in the Voyage and these are also carefully Com∣memorated  ver    Now much time was spent and Sailing was now dangerous because the Fast was already past  This was the yearly Fast of the  Jews  on which the A∣tonement for all the people was made by the HighPriest in the  holy of holies  which day was the of the th Month  Lev  which partly agreed wi  h our  September  and  October  in which time the Sea was not Sailed in by the Antients until the beginning of  March  because of the shortness of the days and violence of the Tempests they were prone to in those Parts this is the sense of Interpre∣ters upon the place The Danger of the Voyage we read of is this  the winds were contrary    ver  this is spoken of the Voyage of the Disciples  The winds were contrary  The Danger  there arose  not only a  contrary wind  but a  violent wind  called an  Euroclydon    ver  some read it a  Whirlewind  but it is meant of an  East∣wind  which raises the Sea mightily The  Tempest  was so great and violent up∣on them they were glad to  let the Ship drive    ver    We have not only the  Danger  in this Voyage but their marvellous  Delive∣rance  and  Preservation  for they came of  all of them with their  lives    ver  the particulars whereof you may see  In the Text we have  three  things obser∣vable Their  Endeavours  in this grea  Distress to preserve themselves  They lightned the Ship  and what was it she was laden with it was  Wheat    ver    They lightned the Ship and cast the Wheat into the Sea  thus did  Jonah  's Mariners cast ou  the  Wares  Alas what are these things but lumber to Lives if it were Gold i  must go for Life  Skin for skin and all tha  a man hath will he give for his Life  Then what should a man give for his Soul  what will a man give in exchange for his Soul  The Endeavour they  cast ou  the Tackling of their Ship  any thing they part with to save their lives though ne∣ver so useful to them even that which was necessary for their Voyage▪ they are under a necessity to part with it for the preservation of their lives  We have their  Dangers  as well as  En∣deavours  It is exprest in the violence of the Tempest  they were exceedingly tosse  with a Tempest  It was dark weather  neither Sun nor Stars appeared  which used to be great comforts and helps to poo  men at Sea Their  Danger  is exprest  n this they were brought to the brink of  he black pit of  Despair all Hope now was  aken away  O what a sad distressed con∣  ition was this their Hope which is  alled the Anchor of the Soul was lost  hey gave all their lives over for gone and  ost And oh what could now a Com∣  any of Men do that had lost their Hopes  nd Hearts could these that had lost  heir Hopes find their Hands they were  ow saying as the Jews did in the Cap∣  ivity  Our Hope is lost we are cut off for our  arts    Ezek    We have their  Deliverance  and  Pre∣  ervation  coming in at such a time and sea∣son as this was now that they are brought  o an extremity God makes it his oppor∣  unity and now that all hope of being  aved is taken away  Salvation  will be most  easonable and now  the Angel appears to  Paul  and tells him all their lives are ensured  nly the Ship shall be lost  Observations are these    Dangers and Deliverances are to be care∣fully recorded and remembred therefore  Paul  takes an account of both here in this Voyage    Salvations and Deliverances many times are not sent until persons be left hopeless in themselves  I shall speak a little to both these upo  this present occasion that what you rea  here may be remarked and remembred    Dangers and Deliverances are to be care∣fully recorded and remembred This Obser∣vation hath two paats    Dangers are t  be remembred    Deliverances are to b  remembred  Thus the Lord's poor people used to d  in all Ages When  Jacob  was in danger o  his Brother  Esau  you see how he comme∣morates it and gives us an exact narrativ  of it and tells us how he feared him  Lord I fear my Brother  Esau  Psal    How often was  David  in danger by  Saul  who was his sworn Enemy and how many  Psalms  have we taking occasion to remember what danger he was in and how comfortably he was brought off  I sough  the Lord and he heard me and delivered m  out of all my fears  Cor As  Paul  tells the  Corinthians  what danger they were in  they were prest out of measure ou  of strength insomuch that they despaired of life  c And so at  Sea  as well as  Land  he would have dangers remembred how that  they go up to Heaven one while and sink into the deeps another their Soul melted because of trouble and they were at their wits ends  c  Peter  's danger at Sea is recorded when he began to sink and cried out  Master save  me or I peresh    Matt  And the Disciples when they cried out  Carest  hou not that we perish  Mark It  s observed the Ship now was full and  ow comes Salvation and Deliverance Here was their danger recorded the Ship was full and Christ asleep in the hinder part of the Ship  Query is How  Dangers  should be  emembred  How  Deliverances  should be remem∣  red    Dangers  should be remembred con∣sidering we may come into them again Many when dangers are not they sing to their Souls that song and delude them∣selves  The bitterness of Death is past  they think they are out of one storm and they shall never come in such another Just as persons do with their  Sickness  at Land  o many do with their  Dangers  at Sea if God bring them off O they grow hard∣  ed and secure again But if God hath brought us home one dangerous Voyage we should think it may be the next will  e as dangerous Have I escaped one at  Sea  one at Land if I do not im∣prove it if I do not walk suitable under it O how easily can God bring me into another You never were in such Dangers but you may come to the like again whether at  Sea  or  Land    Dangers  should be remembred with consideration to the Greatness of them great things should be remembred a grea  God great Mercies great Deliverances great Sins and great Dangers How should we think O what a Danger was I in a  this time by such a Storm at Sea by such a Sickness ashore not only my Life is danger was I fit to die at such a time  had I gotten an interest in Christ if  had been cast away at such a time Me  think dangers great for their Bodies bu  they do not think them so for their Souls they think them great for their Ships fo  their Estates but they do not think them so for their Eternal condition O had not my Body Soul Ship and all perish∣ed together And was not this a grea  danger thy Souls danger was the great∣est danger hadst thou been drowned a  such a time thy Soul had been shipwrackt to all Eternity  Dangers should be remembred with consideration to their Suddenness how many times do they come suddenly upon us As there is sudden Fear so there is sudden Danger  When the Lord send the Winds out of his Treasury suddenly and threatens Men at Sea with sudden destruction when desolation seems to come as a Whirl∣wind  c We should think that if sud∣den  death had come upon me what a con∣dition was my poor Soul in what a dread∣ful thing would it have been if I had been surpris'd on a sudden and sent into an E∣ternal condition in the twinkling of an Eye I to be threatned to be swallowed up only with a formal  God have Mercy upon thee  in thy mouth not to have time to pray repent reflect upon thy past life O what a sad thing is this  We should think of our Dangers with consideration to the frames of our hearts what frames of heart we were then under To the frames of our hearts when in our dangers The frames of our herats when brought from under them The frames of the heart when in and under them were not you under great fears and hurries of Soul it may be not knowing how it would go with your Souls if you had gone off the stage of this life at the present  David  when he was in danger took especial notice of the frame of his spirit  Innumerable evils have compassed me about  Psal He was compass'd about on every side with danger and how was it with him then he calls to mind  Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that I am not a∣ble to look up  Psal And what then O see how he prays  Be pleased O Lord  to deliver me O Lord make hast to help me  Remember what the frames of our heart were in dangers in reference to our fears and secondly what in reference to ou  faith so also did  David  when pursure  in danger by  Saul My heart is fixed my hear  is fixed I will sing and give praise  We ar  to remember our fears under our dangers that we may be prepar'd better for futur  tryals we are to remember our faith unde  dangers past that we may be encourag'd for the time to come in after straits  We are to remember our frames o  spirit when God brings us out of our dan∣ger how then we were melted with th  present sense of the mercy as those  Is∣raelites  when God brought them out o  danger  they believed God they sang and gav  praise  O what resolutions were ther  then upon the Soul to be given up anew to God to walk before the Lord in th  light of the living Thus also did  David  when brought out of danger  Thy vow are upon me O God  c and at another time  The Lord preserveth the simple I was brough  low  c  and thou helpedst me  Psal  And then what a frame of heart wa  upon him  Return unto thy rest O my Soul  c  Psal  Then he was al  for returning to God These we are to remember that we may not wear to∣tally  the sense of them off our Spirits  We should remember our  Dangers  with consideration to the  frequency  of them how frequently we were in them  Paul  re∣member'd this  in Perils by Sea often in Perils by the Heathens  c  Cor  O how often have we been near Drowning near Taking near Sinking near Dying and yet God brought us off these things we should call to mind often who go out upon dangerous Voyages and often come home  he oftner and more frequent our dan∣gers the more should we think upon them  We should Remember our  Deliver∣ances  but how We should Remember them so as to admire them thus did the people of the  Jews  in  Ezra Who hath given them such Deliverance as this  O they ad∣mire it and write a Nonsuch upon the Head of it as  David  admired the good∣ness of God when he had spoken of his House to come  Is this the manner of Men O God  He was in an holy Extasy of Heavenly admiration so should you say  ow to carry out and bring home in such a Dangerous time as this To hide from Enemies when sought for in such a time such a Voyage as this Oh  who am I And what is my Fathers house that he should bring me hitherto  You should turn  he Deliverance on every side and ad∣mire  the Goodness of God the Wisdom of God the Mercy of God the Power of God the Faithfulness of God in it and say O Lord what a Deliverance is this What a Voyage is this God loves to have his Mercies admir'd by us  We should Remember our Delive∣rances to have our Hearts raised up it gratitude and thankfulness to God for them Thus did  David I will pay my vows unto the Lord in presence of all his people I will take the Cup of Salvation and will cal  upon the Name of the Lord  Psal We are to remember to pay our Thankofferings unto God after our De∣liverance from God What forget such a Deliverance as this What not be thank∣ful for such a Preservation as this  We should Remember our Delive∣rances so as to endear our Hearts to God Thus we find  David I will love thee O Lord▪ I will love the Lord dearly  so the Heb  The Lord is my Rock my Fortress and my Deliverer  c  Psal  O now how should Souls after their Deliverance boil and burn in Love to God How are we engaged to a Friend that is at any time but an Instrument in God's hand to De∣liver us And shall we be endeared to the Instrument and not to the Author O how was  David  endeared to God  when he said  He having Redeemed him he would walk before the Lord in the Land of the Living  Psal  ult  We should Remember our  Delive∣rances  to improve them in a way of acting Faith when the next danger and straits come  I will remember thee from the Land of Jordan from the Hill Missar  Psal This was to encourage him from his former Deliverances in his future straits and exigencies What now distrust God who hath delivered in Six Troubles and now shall we give way to Unbelief in the Seventh Did not holy  David  thus  He hath delivered me out of the Paw of the Lyon and out of the Paw of the Bear and he wi  deliver me out of the hand of the uncircumcised Philistine  Thus  Paul  remembers his De∣liverance from  Nero And I was delivered  ut of the mouth of the Lyon and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work  Tim    We should remember our Delive∣rances to be often inculcating and im∣printing them upon our own hearts A∣  s when we receive them they are a lit∣tle fresh it may be upon our spirits but O  ow soon do they die because they are  ot written upon our hearts they are not  ngraven there as a Man that would Re∣member a thing beit a Notion or an  Resolution he will be often turning it o∣ver in his thoughts Alas if we write o  Deliverances Is it not in the Dust where as we should write them in Marble We should write them with a Pen of Iro  and the point of a Diamond  We should commemorate our Dan∣gers with our Deliverances because God gives them to that end The Lord doth not give us our Deliverances to cast them at our heels nor brings us out of our Da  ∣ers that we might forget them as tho w  had never been in any of them God ex∣pects that we should faithfully Registe  and Record them therefore it was a great Provocation to the Lord that the Chil∣dren of  Israel  so soon forgot his works If you do but forget the kindness of Friend you think it is disingenuous bu  O then What is it to forget that God that hath delivered you out of six trou∣bles and in seven troubles God loves and expects his kindness should be kept upon Record  We should Commemorate our Dan∣gers and Deliverances because it was free∣ly of his grace to bring us out of the on  and put us under the other Is it not o  his meer mercy that he rescu'd and pull'd us out of our dangers Might not we else have been swallow'd up by them And  may not we all say in this case as the Psalmist in that  Had it not been the Lord who was on our side then the waters had over∣whelmed us the stream had gone over our Soul then the proud Waves had gone over our Soul  Psal May not you who have been so often deliver'd at Sea in imminent dangers sing this Song What and now forget such dangers and cast behind your backs such Deliverances Oh the freer any favour is the more it should be re∣membred Doth God see any thing in us or in our Families more than others to bestow such deliverances for One Man goes to Sea and he is taken ano∣ther goes to Sea and he is sunk another goes to Sea and he dies the Time of the Voyage And why doth the Lord pre∣serve you Is not this FreeGrace not because you are more Righteous but be∣cause he is more Gracious And should not this be remembred  Our Dangers and Deliverances should be remembred because God hath gracious ends and designs both in the one and the other What ends hath God to bring us into dangers He by this hath an end and design to quicken us up to duty it may be there may be some ommitted du∣ty neglected duties often bring Men in∣to great and imminent dangers it may be  a Person is convinced of the duty of Prayer but it may be neglected Oh then God will bring him into danger to quicken him to his duty Oh says God  In their affiction they will seek me early  The very Heathen Mariners called out for Prayer in time of danger Observe it that Persons convinced of duties either Personal or Domestical and yet neglect∣ed God usually whips them to their Du∣ties by one danger affliction or another The Proverb is good  if you wonld teach a Man to Pray send him to Sea  God by bringing us into dangers hath a design upon us to convince us of sin many Convictions have come into the Soul at this door Dangers have often proved in∣lets to Convictions Oh What Convic∣tions have many poor Souls lain under while in danger when it may be the dan∣gers have given them a view of Eternity when Dangers have presented Death to the Man and Conscience hath cried  Now thou art sinking now there is but a step betwixt thee and Eternity betwixt thee and and another World  Oh then what Con∣victions hath the Soul lain under and yet it may be when the Danger is over the Conviction is over too Well though we may forget all yet God remembers all God hath a design upon us in  our Dangers to prepare us for our latter end The danger thou wert in and have escaped calls for thee to prepare for thy Death which must certainly come to pass shortly God by Dangers would have you prepare for Death And Oh What a cutting Consideration will this be when thou comest to die that thou who hast been in so many dangers by Sea and Land shouldst have no more learned to die nor art yet ready to die Alas you escaped the last that you might prepare for the next God hath a design upon our Graces by bringing us into dan∣ger Danger is to evert and draw forth Grace Thus the Disciples Dangers at Sea were to draw forth their Faith Faith and Patience come most visibly upon the stage in times of most imminent Danger  God by bringing us into Dangers hath a design upon our Souls he some∣times by danger of drowning the Body hath saved the Soul and hath caused it to say  Periissem nisi periissem I had pe∣rished if had not perished  Some have escaped Shipwrack of Soul by Shipwrack of Body And shall we forget such Dan∣gers when God hath such gracious de∣signs in them upon us  He drives on gracious ends and de∣signs in our  Deliverances  And shall we  then forget them  c  He spares us that we may account his longsuffering Salvation he gives by sparing of us space to Repent and Oh What a dread∣ful thing is it not to remember where∣fore we are spared and delivered  He gave her space to Repent but she Repented not  Psal  ult  The Prisoner is Re∣prieved that he might sue out his Par∣don and will he forget the End for which he is Reprieved  He delivers that we may live to him Why were  Da∣vid's Feet deliver'd from falling  It was that  he might walk before the Lord in the light of the Living He gives us our Lives that we might give them back again to God  Jer Men are not delivered from Dan∣gers to live to themselves to live to their Lusts to Drink and Swear and Rant and Roar as a great many poor Wretch∣es do That say as they did  We are de∣liver'd to do all these abominations  Psal  God hath another End of De∣liverance that we might glorifie him in paying our Vows to him  I will deli∣ver thee  And what then When out of Trouble never remember it more cast it behind thy back O no  And thou shalt glorifie me  He aims at a Revenue of Glory out of your Deliverances  God hath another End of Delivering of  us that we might enter into New En∣gagements to be more the Lord's a in times of great Dangers there use to be great Engagements betwixt God and the Soul so in times of Great Delive∣rances there are great Engagements pass betwixt God and the Soul New Dedi∣cations to God New Deliverances call for New Dedications of the Soul to God now the Soul should be set apart for God more than ever  God hath a∣nother End in Delivering of us that we might break off our League with Sin thus it was with them  shall we break his Commaandments after such great Delive∣rance as this  APPLICATION  Is it so that our  Dangers  and  Delive∣rances  should be remembred by us Then it is a word of Information  Learn we here how acceptable it is to God th  t we thankfully congratu∣late our Mercies No Musick like a sound of Trumpets off the Waters So O what sweet Musick doth it make in God's Ears that you thankfully record SeaMercies and SeaDeliverances this is the Musick of the Waters this makes Melody in God's Ears  SeaPrayers  and  SeaPraises  come up acceptably before the Lord he is so Pleased with them that he hath called them Sacrifices O  that Men would offer the Sacrifice of Praise  this is the sound of Trumpets you should carry to Sea with yon Outward bound and Homeward bound  Learn we hence what a Great E∣vil it is to lose the remembrance of our Dangers and Deliverances What do many Families What do many Persons with the SeaDangers with the SeaDe∣liverances Do not they write them in Dust Do not they Bury them in the Grave of Oblivion Do not they cast them behind their Backs Do not they trample them under Foot O poor Souls They little know what they do  Such Deliverances will have a Resur∣rection in their Consciences one Day though they Bury them now O they will Rise again And Oh How will they then dread and terrifie a poor Soul  Such Deliverances will another Day be Witnesses and Evidences against you Oh What a cutting testimony will they give in against the Soul Hast not thou been graciously and wonderfully delive∣red in such a Voyage in such a Storm at Sea is such a Sickness at Shore and yet walked unsuitably under all these  To be cast out by Mercy O what a dreadful thing is this  Such Delive∣rances forgotten by us harden us ei∣ther they soften or harden These Pro∣vidences are like God's Ordinances in this respect they either harden or soften Oh What a dreadful thing it is to be hardened by Deliverances and Preserva∣tion and yet many are  Sentence being not speedily Executed the Hearts of Men are fully set in them to do Evil  Such De∣liverances will be great Aggravations both of Man's Sin and Misery if forgot∣ten by them The Goodness of God was the Aggravation of the Sin of  David  says God  When I had done so and so for thee nay and I would have done more wherefore hast thou dispised the Commandment of the Lord to do Evil in his Sight  Sam What for you that had such Deliverances as these to break his Com∣mandment as  Ezra  says O this is an high Aggravation  Deliverances and Dangers forgotten will cause the Lord to pull in his Hand in a way of Mercy will cause God to give up Persons and take his Protecting Presence from them take them from the shadow of his Wings Souls by forgetting past Dangers and Deliverances may put themselves from under God's Protection for the future  Use  Is it so that we are to Remem∣ber our Seadangers and Deliverances then it is a word of  Exhortation  be ex∣horted then to call to mind and keep in mind what God hath done for you and in this Exhortation I address my self to Seafaring Men whose lives are a course and series of Wonders in their frequent Salvations and Preservations witness this Treatise as you  see the wonders of God in the Deeps viz  The wonders of his Creation so do you see the wonders of his Salvation How of∣ten may  Wonderful  be Written upon the Head of Salvations that you are every Voyage receiving from God you never go out and come home but God works  Wonderfully  and appears  Wonderfully  for you Is not he a WonderworkingGod for you every Voyage  The  Exhortation  is to call to mind and keep in mind to Record and Register your Dangers and Deliverances and not to do as  Israel  is said to do who soon for∣got his Works How often doth God bring this sin of theirs in one  Psalm They forgot his works and the wonders he had shewed them Psal    Psal    Keep them in mind for they are wonderful Dangers and Deliverances  They are Wonders these are to be re∣membred  Marvellous things did he for them in the sight of their Fathers  c  He divided the Sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap Psal  And it is brought in again in that  Psalm They remembred not his hand nor the day when God delivered them out of the hand of the E∣nemy  c  Psal  And in ano∣ther place  They forgot God their Savi∣our which had done great things in Egypt Wondrous works in the Land of Ham Psal  This heightens the and sin exceedingly to forget such Great Wonderful Dangers and Deliverances  Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Respect they are often such as threa∣ten a sentence of Death to be executed upon you May it not be said of poor Seamen as was of them  For we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trou∣ble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength inso∣much that we despaired of Life but we had the sentence of death in our selves that we should not trust in our selves but in him that raiseth the dead who delivered us from so great a Death and doth Deliver  Cor O how many Seafaring  Men may say thus  Our Dangers have been such as we have often despaired of Life there hath been but a little betwixt us and Death nay betwixt us and Eternity  And shall we forget such dangers when we have been so near death in them As he said to  David As the Lord lives there is but one step betwixt thee and death  O how often have you been near sinking near drowning and yet God hath then appeared for you with an outstreached Arm and in the Mount hath he been seen And will you not remember this  Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Respect they are sudden and sur∣prizing they are wonderfully sudden threatned with nothing but present Death and Destruction It may be said of Seamen as of those in  Job Snares compassed them about and sudden fear trou∣bled them  Job It doth not on∣ly trouble them but all on a sudden trou∣ble them before they know almost where they are as we say We read of some whose Calamity shall come suddenly  Suddenly shall he be broken without Remedy  Prov O how terrible is such a case or such a danger And hath not God often threatened to make this your case and condition O then do not forget such dangers that have so suddenly lookt you in the Face  Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Respect they are not Dangers in which your Bodies are concerned only but they are Dangers in which your Souls are concerned It is not only the danger of a Shipwrack'd Vessel and a Shipwrack'd Estate and a Shipwrack'd Body but a Shipwrack'd Soul Here is the great danger lest thou make a lost Voyage for thy Soul If thou hadst di∣ed in such a Storm or died in the Time of such a Voyage Oh What would have become of thy Soul thy precious thy immortal Soul Hadst not thou died in a Carnal in a Christless state and con∣dition Had not they poor Soul perish'd to all Eternity if thou then hadst mis∣carried Wast not thou then a stran∣ger altogether to Christ and a Work of Saving Grace upon thy Heart Hadst not thou then the guilt of all thy sins upon the back of thy Soul unpardoned And O what danger was this And wilt thou forget such dangers  Your Dangers are such at Sea as none but a God can deliver from all your skill cannot O then is the great∣est Artist at his Wits end The Psal∣mist tells us  Psal    the Mari∣ners in their Storms are at their wits end  or as some read it  all their wisdom is  swallowed up they know not what course to steer  the  Dutch  Annorators carry it  Now their very Pilots are at a loss Now all their courage cannot contribute to their delive∣rance though men of the greatest natural cou∣rage and magnanimity in the world Yet now their Hearts melt because of trou∣bles  as it said of the Mariners in  Jonah's  Ship  The Mariners were afraid  O now when Death and Eternity the Grave and Judgment to come looks them in the face Then they are  MagorMissa∣bibs  terror to themselves and to all a∣bout them O then the danger is such it must be only the finger of God that can help I have heard of a Ship in  Yar∣mouth  Road that in a great Storm they feared the Anchor would come home and the Master discoursing with a Youth in the Ship that God had begun lately to work some Convictions upon  O says he  Master  if God do but lay a Finger upon one Strand of the Cable it will hold  and in the morning many Ships were lost near them and there was but one Strand in the Ca∣ble left O the singer of God only can save in some dangers It was a good say∣ing of a Godly Commander of a Ship in imminent danger  None now but that God that saved the Children of  Israel  at the Red Sea can save us out of this distress  and as soon  as he had said it the Wind altered and saved them And will you forget such dangers as none but a God can save from  Your dangers at Sea are such as many thousands have perished in how many have gone to Sea that never returned more that have been swallowed up in the belly of the great Deeps How many have perished by the Sword at Sea how many by violent Storms and that God should put a difference betwixt you and others and you should forget it this ex∣ceedingly heightens and aggravates the guilt How many have lost their lives how many have lost their limbs and yet in such dangers God hath brought you off this is never to be forgotten  Your dangers are not only wonder∣ful but your deliverances are so too and therefore should be remembred There is never a deliverance but you may read a wonder in it so many deliverances and salvations at Sea so many wonders God saves you in a miraclous way  Is not this a wonder that persons of such great sins and provocations should be persons of such great salvations and preservations that such as sin every Voyage nay it may be at an high rate sin every Voyage should be saved and de∣livered at such an high rate every Voyage  is not this a wonder that Men of such sins should be men of such salvations that men that sin against these salvations should not have these deliverances shorten upon them Oh what a wonder is this We should wonder if a person should be con∣tinually disobliging any of us and yet we should be still heaping up kindnesses up∣on him This made the Prophet  Ezra  say  Shall we again break his Commandments after such deliverances as this  O do not you pro∣voke the Lord every time that you go out and still he delivers you still he returns you to your Relations to visit your habi∣tations in peace and is not this a wonder  Your deliverances are wonderful if you consider your deliverances are great deliverances We read of such  And the Lord saved them with a great de∣liverance  or with a great Salvation Thus said  Sampson Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy Servant  Judg Now any great transacti∣ons are remembred and recorded Your deliverances are great if we consider these things  They are commanded deliverances by the great God his word of command brings all our deliverances about whether at Sea or Land Which made the Church in distress pray  Thou art my King O God command deliverances  for  Jacob  Psal  He commands every thing tending to deliverance at Sea in order to deliverance he com∣mands the Winds  He maketh the Storm a Calm  Psal He also commands the Seas  He says to the proud Waves So far and no farthar  You read of a decree set to the Sea to command the Sea that it cannot pass  Though the Waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not pre∣vail though they roar yet can they not pass over it  Jer It is the great God only that rides Lord Admiral at Sea to command the Seas and the Waves thereof God is said to shut up the Sea with doors and set bars upon it  Hitherto shalt thou come and no further and here shall thy proud waves be stay'd  Job  Xerxes  presum'd he could tame the  Hellespont  for attemp∣ting his Bridge of Boats but all this was in vain this is a flower in God's Crown alone to command the Sea Your deli∣verances are a fruit and effect of God's commanding Power therefore great  They are great deliverances as they are the curious workmanship as I may call them of the Attributes of a great God Deliverance is said to be wrought for us it is the handy work of God  If God will work who can let  as the Prophet saith  Isa  And he seems to speak  it upon the account of the deliverance of his People  For your sake I have sent done to Babylon and have brought down all their Nobles and the Chaldeans whose cry is in their ships  In every deliverance there is the excellent work of the Attributes of God we may in such a deliverance say  Here is the Power of God  and  here is the Wisdom of God  and  here is the Wisdom of God  and  here is the Love of God  and  here is the Faithfulness of God  c For as God in the confounding of the Languages at  Babel  said  Go to let us go down  as if he directed himself to his glorious Throne  Come let us go down  Gen Or as some take it of the Trinity as in the Creation So when God sends us deli∣verances in our distresses he sets his Attributes at work  Go Power go Mercy go Love go Faithfulness go and act your respective parts in this deliverance  and must not this be then an excellent and curious Piece that God's Attributes brings forth  They are great deliver∣ances if we consider the great sins and provocations they come over the heads of the great unworthiness of the received heightens much the mercy and favour received the reason why per∣sons do not greaten their deliverances is because they do not greaten their sins in  the deep sense and aggravations of them O such a Soul would say as  David is this the manner of Men  O God is not this a great deliverance for such a great sinner to receive  They are great Deliverances if we consider the time and season of their coming in as this Deliverance of the Ships Company where  Paul  was  it was when all hope of being saved was taken away  and so were many of the Deliverances mention'd in this Treatise So  Peter  's SeaDeliverance  when he began to sink Christ stretched forth his hand immediately  he was now sinking and going but see how ready Christ was to save  He stretched forth his hand and caught  Peter  Matth  Our sinking time is  Jesus Christ's  sav∣ing time  In the Mount is the Lord seen  our extremity is Gods opportunity and are not then the great deliverances never to be forgotten  They are great deliverances if we consider they are not only Deliver∣ances of the Bodies and Ships and Estates sometimes but Souls and where the Ship is lost and the Estate is lost yet for the life to be saved and the Soul deliver∣ed is a very great Deliverance a Re∣prieve when a Prisoner is under the sen∣tence of Death is a great Mercy O when God Reprieves a poor Prisoner this is some Deliverance we read of  some Deliverance God gave to  Israel  in the days of  Shishak  a Reprieve is some Deliverance but if it end in suing out the Prisoner's Pardon then it is a great Deliverance If it be such a Deliverance in a Storm at Sea as  Hezekiah  had from a Sickness at Shore  Thou hast deliver'd me in love to my Soul and cast all my Sins behind thy back  Isa This is a double De∣liverance and sure such Deliverances as these are worth Recording These are to be written in Marble and not in Dust with the Pen of Iron as the Prophet says and not with the point of a Dia∣mond  Your Deliverances are wonderful if you consider the many thousands that have perished in less Dangers to an Eye of Reason they are distinguishing Deli∣verances and therefore wonderful hath God dealt with all Men that go to Sea as with you Have not thousand perished by the Sword at Sea in bloody Engage∣ments Miscarried at Sea in dreadful and terrible Storms Hath not the Sea been a Sepulchre for thousands Are not there Millions of the Dead that the Sea must one Day give up and yet you Delivered and yet you Spared O what distinguish∣ing Mercy is this And shall this be for∣gotten by you Should not you keep Re∣cords  of distinguishing Mercy How ma∣ny sunk sometimes and perished by your sides How many that went out with you that never Returned One taken and another left one sunk and ano∣ther saved  Your Deliverances are Wonderful if you consider the way that sometimes God takes to bring them about O what strange ways doth God take to Deliver when he hath a Mind to Deliver some∣times he brings down to the  very Gate of the Grave  he brings to the Doors and Bars of the Sea and then shuts these Doors as  Job  speaks He brings to the next Door to perishing and then he De∣livers  Master save me or I perish  and then he lends an Arm witness many of these Deliverances here mention'd Some∣times he doth it by strange means low and contemptible as the poor Man that we Read of that Delivered the City  Eccles  sometimes by unthought of and unexpected means as he that Re∣lieved Major  Gibbons  as this Story men∣tions he was a  French  Pyrate As that Ship I have heard of that when she sprang a Leak and they all had like to have perished and all on a sudden the Leak stopt and they knew no Reason but when they came into the next Port  to search her there was a great Fish ha  wrought himself in the Leak that they were glad to cut him out was not here a Miraculous Deliverance That  Jona  should be swallowed up by the Whale  what a Miracle was this And so he was preserv'd And how have some been sa∣ved by sudden shifts of Winds when near sinking and perishing These are to be remembred to the Lord while you live Oh Methinks this one Motive should set on the Exhortation if I should use no more to Remember your Dangers and your Deliverances  But secondly another Motive is this to Remember your Dangers with your Deliverances this will in your great Distresses and Extremities contribute some Hope to you to read over your Register your ancient Records how good God hath been at such a time and such a time how seasonably he stept in and Delivered in such a strait and such a strait Oh then says the Soul why then should I Despair and cast off all Hope now Hath not he appeared and saved in Deaths often before now For past Experiences are good supports for Hope in present Exigencies and Extre∣mities thus  David  argues when at a great strait  Thou hast delivered me and  wilt deliver me  and thus St  Paul Thou hast delivered me and wilt deliver me Haman  found this a good way to Remember the Years of the Lord's Right Hand  Remember your Dangers and De∣liverances for God records them they are filed up by God and he will mind you of them another Day if you forget them now he keeps his Journals and Records he hath his Book of Remem∣brance of your forgotten Mercies as well as your forgotten Sins God will one Day read over all those Deliverances you have forgotten  Oh poor Soul Did not I deliver thee in such a Danger in such a Distress in such a Death when there was no Hope when there was no Help yet all this hast thou forgotten forgotten'thy Mercy and forgotten the God of thy Mercy  Oh will not this sting you to the Heart when God shall cause your strangled and murdered Mercies to walk in your Consciences when he shall give them a Resurrection there  Motive to Remember your Dangers and Deliverances The Vows of God are upon you Oh What did you say to God in the day of your Distress and Calamity  Lord if thou wilt appear and be a present Help in time of Trouble it shall never be for gotten it shall he Remembred  to the Lord as long as we have a Day to Live  but when God brings poor Souls off many do not only forget their Vows but deny them In Ancient times it was usual in imminent Dangers whether a  Sea or Land to make Vows We read that  Jonah  's Mariners they vowed Vows  Jonah    David  did thus  Thy Vows are upon me O God I will render praises unto thee  c  Psal  and in ano∣ther place  I will pay thee my Vows which my Lips have uttered and my Mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble  Psal But because this is so ordinary to make Vows at Sea and break them a Shoar let me enlarge a little upon it Why should you forget your Vows after your Deliverances They were not  ash Vows there might have been some Excuse if you had made them rash∣ly you might then have had a Plea for saying it was an Error but in times of Distress Men are serious when Death and Eternity are set before them and they upon the brink of another World dare you Sinners rashly Vow in this day of your Distress O no your Consciences will bear Witness against you that you were in Sobersadness at that day Why should you ferget your Vows after Deliverances for God will require Pay∣ment  Nay this is not only the Reason why we should not forget to pay but why we should not delay the Pay  When thou vowest a Vow to the Lord thy God thou shouldst not be slack to Pay it for the Lord thy God will require it yea will surely require it of thee and it would be Sin in thee  Deut Take it for granted he will do it so as to call to a Payment Day he will demand it he will send unto you a Summons to Pay the Vows you made to him in the day of your Distress Oh How often is Con∣science God's Officer that he sends to you to demand Payment O says Con∣science  Sinner Pay what thou owest to the God of thy Deliverances it not he a God to whom thy Vows must be Performed  He will require it so as to punish the Non∣payment and so requiring is here ta∣ken and in many other places the Lord doth very often severely punish Vow∣breaking breaking of Vows doth cause God often to destroy the works of your Hands Say not before the Angel  It was an Error wherefore should God be angry at thy Vows and destroy the works of thy Hands  Eccles Some Expositors refes this to the Priest before whom the Sin of rash Vows was to be confess'd others carry it to Christ the Angel of the Co∣venant  who sees through all our subti Excuses and Equivocations and punishe  them O God is angry when Men go so flatly against their Vows O ther God is angry and destroys the work o  their Hands  viz  disappoints their En∣deavours and denies their Success  Lastly  to forget your Deliverances and Dangers is the greatest Ingratitude and Unthankfulness in the World hath God given you so many wonderful De∣liverances so many miraculous Preser∣vations to be buried in the Grave of Oblivion Will you Murder your Mer∣cies and then bury them It is common∣ly said  Murder will out  Murdered Mer∣cies will one day make terrible work in walking in your Consciences  The next Observation is this That Salvations and Deliverances many times are not sent until Persons be left Help∣less and Hopeless I shall give you a touch of this  Now all hope of being saved was taken away no small Tempest lay upon upon them now they were gulft in Despair of ever coming off with their Lives  Yet this often is the condition of Nations ShipCompanies and Persons where God intends to save and deliver The Proofs of the last Observations about Dangers and Deliverances being record∣ed  and remembred proves this also Thus was  Peter  saved the Disciples saved when just at sinking  But why doth God stay so long before he sends Deliverances and Salvations Because he delights to draw forth a Spirit of Prayer if Men will not Pray when sinking when Drowning when Dying they will never Pray O see how  Jonah  Prays in his distress  And  Jonah  Prayed to the Lord out of the Fishes Belly and said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the Belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my Voice  c  When my Soul faint∣ed within me I remembred the Lord and my Prayer came in unto thy Holy Temple  Jonah O Sirs God loves Prayer so well that he stays with his Deliverances that he might sue them out by Prayer  Out of the Depths have cried unto thee  saith  David  Psal Driven to it by deep and bottomless straits into which I am plunged And it seems to be an Illusion to Mariners in their Distresses and Dangers of being Shipwrackt crying unto the Lord What will any Man perish and never Pray for it Die and never Cry for it What and not say as  Peter  did  Master save me or I perish  What was it that did draw  forth Prayer in many of these Distressed Ship Companies in this Treatise menti∣oned but their Dangers and Distresses  God doth not bring our Deliver∣ances and Salvations until we be Hope∣less because he will exercise his Peoples Graces Therefore the Disciples were not saved until the Ship was full that their Graces might be exercised O now is a time for Faith and Patience to be exerted there is nothing more pleasing unto God than to see how poor Souls exercise their Graces when they are re∣duced to Extremities God hath a great revenue of Glory arising to himself out of the exercise of his own Grace in the Souls of Believers O how doth Faith act its part when Mercy and Deliverance is delay'd It was one of  Luther  's won∣ders  to believe for Mercy that was long de∣lay'd  It is an high exercise of Faith to look up to God long together and no∣thing to come To say with the Pro∣phet  Jonah I will look again towards thy Holy Temple  Jonah And with the Prophet  Isaiah Tho' he hide his Face from the House of  Jacob  I will wait upon him and look for him  Isaiah What tho' thou be as the Prophet's Servant who went down to the Sea to look and he said  Master there is nothing  But what  then Doth he give over O no  the looks again  and  the seventh look he saw he Cloud  So Faith in its exercise will look again and again and never give over until it espie the Mercy coming upon the wings of Prayer So might I add of Patience O how doth it act its part while the Deliverance tarries it quietly waits for the Salvation of God saying as  David My Soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the Morning  Psal The Soul of the Believer possesses it self in Patience until the Mercy come  God doth not bring our Salvations and Deliverances until we be brought to an Extremity because they are most prized and welcomed then O now Deliverance will be prized The longer that a Mercy tarries the more welcome it is when it comes God loves to make all his Mercies welcome to us O how welcome is Life to a Person under a Sentence of Death O how welcome is a Discovery of the love of Christ to a poor Soul that hath long groaned under the burthen of unpardon'd Guilt O how welcome was the Prodigal's Father's House when he had so long been star∣ving in the Fields with his Husks a∣mongst the Swine  Because God will have all his Sal∣vations and Deliverances look like his own Hand and Arm his Arm brings Salvation with him he will have the print of his own Hand upon it that poor Sinners may say  This is the Finger of God the doing of God and it is marvellous in our Eyes  Alas Men would attribute it to themselves if Salvation did not come in such a way  when all hope of be∣ing Saved is taken away  Oh Every thing is beautiful in its Season is not Salvation and Deliverance now in Sea∣son Now they begin to Despair as to probable or visible hopes O now God works like himself now he appears in a Deliverance to be God which set the Disciples a wondering  What manner of Man is this that the Winds and the Sea obey him  Mark And at another time when he deliver'd his Disciples at Sea and calmed the Winds then they that were in the Ship Worshipped him saying  Of a truth thou art the Son of God    Because he will by such Salvations set off his Love to poor Souls Was not the Love of Christ set off highly in ta∣king that Season to save the Ship  when it was full to save them when they were sinking  is not that great Love that steps  forth to save in an Extremity O what Love was this to save this Ships Com∣pany  when all hope of being saved was ta∣ken away  Love always chuses the fittest times to appear and evidence it self  Lastly  Because he will have his Deli∣verances endearing Deliverances to Souls O how doth such an appearance of God at such a time endear the Soul of the Receiver Therefore saith  Da∣vid I will love the Lord  or love the Lord dearly  my Rock and my Deliverer  c  But I will proceed to give you also a∣taste of the  Application  and not to be large because I have been large upon the former which was mainly intended  Then learn we hence that God may for gracious ends known to himself delay a Mercy or a Deliverance and yet fully intend to give in that Mercy  Ja∣cob may wrestle all Night and yet be put off but in the break of Day the Mercy comes  The Woman of  Canaan  may cry to Christ for her Daughter and at present be put off yet at last she shall carry it The belie∣ving Soul may not have the  Dove  come with an  OliveBranch  in her Mouth until Evening Christ's manifesting of his Love to poor Souls is called his Supping with them  And I will Sup with you  Now Supper comes not up till Evening  Learn we hence that God's timing our Deliverances and Salvations is best for us his Time is the best Time Our time is always ready but saith Christ  My time is not yet  If we had our Mercies in our time we should not see that beau∣ty in them for every thing is beautiful in its Season And God chuses the fittest Seasons to send them because he will put a beauty upon them  Learn we hence  that no case is de∣sperate to God tho' it be so to Man  One would have thought this a desperate case  in such a Storm lightning the Ship  the  cast∣ing cut of the Tackling of the Ship neither Sun nor Stars appeared and all hope of be∣ing saved taken away  yet all this was but desperate to them it was not so to God Now their Extremity becomes God's op∣portunity and he takes this Juncture of time to appear in Thus  David  Psal all God's  Waves and  God's  Billows had gone over him  a desperate case Yet God then he believes  would command his loving kindness in the Daytime and the Song should be with him in the Night  Faith is an excellent Grace at a desperate stand  Learn we hence that  God's Thoughts are not as our thoughts  when  think of nothing but sinking and perishing then doth God think of Saving and Delivering  They thought  all hope of being saved was taken away  but God looks through the Storm and Cloud and Comforts them As the Disciples when they thought it had been a Spirit in their Storm that ap∣peared to them  No  saith Christ  be not afraid be of good chear it is I  Mark  Use  Is it so that the Salvations and Deliverances that many of us have are not until we are brought to Extremities Then it is a word of  Exhortation  Then look up to God in the most desperate Case when you know not what to do in your Storms at Sea in your Straits at Land O then let your Eyes be up unto the Lord you see how many Delive∣rances have come down in Extremities as answers to Prayer O Pray hard let going to Sea being in Storms at Sea being brought to Extremities at Sea learn you to Pray  FINIS  PRAYERS To be Used by  SeafaringMen  The Mariners Prayer  O GOD the great Creator of Heaven and Earth thou dost whatsoever thou pleasest in the Sea and in all deep Places I the most unworthiest of all thy Ser∣vants am at this time called upon to be∣hold thy Wonders in the Deep and to perform my Duty in great Waters Guide me I beseech thee in all times

our own Souls in the great Day of the Lord Jesus to whom with thee and thy Blessed Spirit be ascribed all Honour Power and Glory Adorati∣on and subjection now and for ever∣more  Amen  A Prayer before a Voyage  OETERANL God even the God of our Salvation the hope of all the ends of the Earth and of them that remain in the wide Ocean under the shadow of whose Wings we are always secure and without whose protection we cannot expect safety I have been O Lord preserved by thee until this mo∣ment from many Dangers for which I have not expressed my thankfulness in acknowledging those Daily Blessings I have received from thee but O Lord forget and forgive those manifold Sins which I have committed against thee and blot them out of thy Book of Remem∣brance  Purge me O Lord I beseech thee from all vile affections and grant I may bring forth the fruits of thy Spirit go along with me with thy blessed Spirit in this my Voyage preserve me from Pi∣rates Robers and Enemies defend me from Rocks Sands and Shelves and keep me from Thunder and Lightning Storms and Tempestous Werther or any other Danger that may dismay me To thee O Lord I commend my Body  and Spirit to dispose of me according to thy holy Will and Pleasure if thou art pleas'd to call for my Life upon the Sur∣face of the Waters I know thy Al∣mighty Word can command the Sea to give up her Dead at the last and great Audit  But if thou hast determin'd to bring me Safe to my desired Heaven give me thy Grace which is sufficient for me to Walk according to thy holy Will in all things make me to lay hold of Eternal Life which as the Anchor of Hope is both sure and stedfast keep me from all Temptations Ghostly and Bodily and from sudden Death and in thy good time bring me to the Land of the Living there to Reign with thee for evermore  Amen  A Thanksgiving after a Voyage  OIMMORTAL God I have seen thy Works O Lord and thy Won∣ders in the deep thou spakest the Word and the Stormy Wind arose which lifted up the Waves thereof but when we cried unto thee thou madest the Storm to cease so that the Waves thereof were still then did we rejoyce because we were at rest and thou broughtest us safe to that Haven where we would be O that Men would therefore praise thee O Lord for thy Goodness and declare the Wonders thou dost con∣tinually for them  I Bless thy Holy Name for Conduct∣ing me through those many Dangers which Encompassed me and Praise thy thy Mercy that the Deep hath not Swal∣lowed me up and that I am not gone down into the place of Silence I also praise thy Holy Name and Admire thy Loving Kindness towards me that thou hast not deliver'd up my Body and Goods  s a Prey into the Hands of un∣rea  ole Men but hast brought me to my desi  ed Haven and at last returned me back in safety to my Habitation  O Let me never forget to pay those Vows I made to thee when I was in trouble but give me an awful sense and apprehension of thy great Power and possess my Soul with a true Reverence of thy Divine Majesty that I may ever∣more Serve thee in Holiness and Righte∣ousness all the Days of my Life Endue me with thy Holy Spirit that I may become acceptable in thy sight and may be fitted at length for future Glories this I beg for thy Son Jesus Christ sake my only Saviour  Amen  A Prayer in a Storm  O LORD our God thou hast com∣manded us in the Day of Calamity to call upon thy Name and thou hast promised to hear us Lord I fly unto thee who art a sure refuge thy Flood∣gates are opened and the Floods lift up their lofty Waves But thou O Lord most high art mightier than the Noise of many Waters yea than the mighty Waves of the Sea Thou canst in a mo∣ment if it stand with thy Divine will and pleasure rebuke the Winds and the Sea and turn this Storm into a Calm  I know I justly deserve to be cast a∣way and utterly to be rejected by thee but Lord save us or else we perish ac∣cept of my unfeigned Sorrow for all my Sins and Transgressons and endue me with a stedfast resolution to forsake them be merciful unto us O God be merciful unto us and Save us from Perishing in these deep Waters O refresh us with thy Mercy and that soon lest we go down ito the place of silence O com∣fort us in this great distress that though the Sea rage and swell our Hearts may be quiet and still in this time of our dis∣consolation  And as I earnestly desire to be pro∣tected from this great Peril and Danger which now terrifies us so I earnestly beseech thee that thou wilt for ever fill my Heart with such an awful dread of thy Name and praise thy power in the great Congregation awake my dull and drowsie Soul from the sloth of Sin and renew a right Spirit within me fill me with the Gifts of Graces of thy Holy Spirit that I may Live the Life of the Righteous and never forget thy Loving∣kindness save us now from Death I be∣seech thee from the Merciless Waves who are now ready to swallow us up and bring us home in safety for thy Son Jesus Christ his sake our only Lord and Saviour  Amen  A Thanksgiving after a Storm  I PRAISE and Glorifie thy Holy Name O Lord for all thy Mercies and Blessings vouchsafed unto me espe∣cially for this thy last great Deliverance wherein I was incompassed in that wide Ocean whom thou hast set Bounds and Limits to if thou O Lord hadst not been on my side the Sea had swallowed me up quick and I had gone down into the deep silence but thou hast been my God and my Deliverer and hast put a new Song into my Mouth a Song of Praise and Thanksgiving unto my God  I acknowledge O Lord that thou art the God of all the Earth and of them that remain in the broad Sea Blessed for ever and magnified thy Name that thou hast not cast me out of thy sight nor turn'd thy Mercy from me I have escaped the raging Sea and the Noise of the proud Waves have done me no Harm if thy Almighty Providence had not protected me Streams had gone over my Soul But the Stormy Wind and T  mpest I have narrowly Escap'd the Storm is ceased and I am safely De∣livered  And now what shall I render to thee O Lord for this and all other thy great Benefits I will offer up unto thee the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will pay my Vows I so solemnly made unto thee when I was in trouble I will evermore remember that my help is in the Lord who made Heaven and Earth and that thou art that God that can and will deliver me let this thy Mercy and Loving kindness never depart my Me∣mory but let me Praise thy Goodness and Sing of thy Power unto my Lives end  Amen  An Hymn of Praise and Thanksgiving after a dangerous Tempest  O Come let us give thanks unto the Lord for his mercy endureth for ever  Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath delivered from the merciless rage of the Sea  The Lord is gracious and full of com∣passion flow to anger and of great mercy  He hath not dealt with us according to our sins neither rewarded us accord∣ing to our iniquitirs  But as the Heaven his above the Earth so great hath been his mercy towards us  We found trouble and heaviness we were even at deaths door  The Waters of the Sea had well nigh cover'd us the proud waters had nigh gone over our soul  The Sea roared and the stormy wind lifted the waves thereof  We were carried up as it were to Heaven and went down again into the deep our soul melted within us be∣cause of trouble  Then cried we unto the Lord and  thou didst deliver us out of our distress  Blessed be thy name who didst not despise the prayer of thy servants but didst hear our cry and hast saved us  Thou didst send forth thy command∣ment and the windy storm ceased and was turned into a calm  O let us therefore praise the Lord for his goodness and declare the wonders that he hath done and still doeth for the children of men  Praised be the Lord daily even the Lord that helped us and poured his benefits upon us  He is our God even the God of whom cometh salvation God is the Lord by whom we escaped death  Thou Lord hast made us glad through the operation of thy hands and we will triumph in thy praise  Blessed be the Lord God even the Lord God who only doeth wondrous things  And blessed be the name of his Ma∣  for ever and let every one of us say Amen Amen  Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Ghost  As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end  Amen  A Prayer to be said before a Fight at Sea against any Enemy  O Most powerful and glorious Lord God the Lord of hosts that ru∣lest and commandest all things Thou sittest in the throne judging right and therefore we make our address to thy di∣vine Majesty in this our necessity that thou wouldst take the cause into thy own hand and judge between us and our enemies Stir up thy strength O Lord and come and help us for thou givest not always the battel to the strong but canst save by many or by few O let not our sins now cry against us for ven∣geance but hear us thy poor servants beg∣ing mercy and imploring thy help and that thou wouldst be a defence unto us against the face of the enemy Make it appear that thou art our Saviour and mighty deliverer through Jesus Christ our Lord  Amen  FINIS
