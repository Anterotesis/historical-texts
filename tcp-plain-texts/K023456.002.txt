LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in PallMall MDCCLVII  AN ACCOUNT OF THE EUROPEAN SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA VOL II  PART V The French Settlements  CHAP I  _THE French were amongst the last nations who made settlements in the WestIndies but they made ample amends by the vigour with which they pursued them and by that chain of judicious and admirable measures which they used in drawing from them every advantage which the nature of the climate would yield and in contending against the difficulties which it threw in their way The civil wars which divided and harrassed that kingdom from the death of Henry the second with very little interruption until the majority of Lewis the fourteenth withdrew the attention of both prince and people from  their commercial interests to those of parties in religion and government The politicks of the house of Valois though France perhaps was never governed by princes of so ingenious and refined a turn were wholly of the Machiavillian kind They tended to distract to unsettle to try dangerous schemes and to raise storms only to display a skill in pilotage The parties then in France solely contended what power could be given to or taken from the king without considering what could make their country a great kingdom Therefore which way soever the ballance inclined whether to the king or to the nobles to the catholicks or to the protestants it was pretty indifferent to the real happiness of that nation The parties only gamed out of a common stock Neither could be enriched But their dissentions made all of them poor and weak The time of cardinal Richlieu must be considered as the true aera of French policy This great man pacifying all at home exalting the royal authority upon the ruins of the power of the nobility and modelling that great system of general policy in external affairs which has raised France to such a pitch of greatness amongst so many and such extensive cares did not forget those of commerce and what serves most effectually to support commerce colonies and establishments abroad But the circumstances of the time and his genius that embraced so many  objects did not leave him leisure to perfect what he began It was reserved for that great wise and honest minister Colbert one of the ablest that ever served any prince to bring that plan to perfection to carry it in a great measure into execution and to leave things in such order that it was not difficult when favourable circumstances offered to make France one of the first trading powers in Europe and her colonies the most powerful their nature considered of any in America  So early as the reign of Francis I the French attempted an establishment in NorthAmerica but it was not until the year that they made their first settlement in the WestIndies This was upon St Christopher one of the Caribee islands A remarkable circumstance attended it the English took possession of the island the same day But this settlement had no long life on either side The Spaniards had reason to dread the establishment of such powers in their neighbourhood and they envied the French and English those advantages it was foreseen they would draw from countries from which they had themselves no benefit and which they claimed only to keep them desarts  They assaulted these new colonies and drove them out of the island The English colony soon returned and possessed themselves of the largest and best part before the French  could collect themselves who finding the English already settled in the best part left a small colony on the other part But their chief and the most adventurous of their inhabitants went in search of other seats when after various fortune and after combating the difficulties which a new country and their own imprudence had caused them they made a considerable settlement in the islands of Martinico and Guardaloupe  Cardinal Richlieu saw very early into the advantages which might arise from these settlements if prudently managed and he thought the most prudent management both for securing and extending them consisted in but one article which was to put the government into proper hands With that view he made choice of Monsieur de Poincy a knight of Malta who was sent thither with the title of governor and lieutenantgeneral of the isles of America and a very ample commission No person could be better fitted to rectify the disorders that naturally must arise in every new settlement and to put things in a right channel for the time to come Of a good family of an unblemished reputation for probity of great reading of much and various knowledge of life and of a genius as variously exercised He was a master in mechanical learning in which he excelled not more to his own honour than to the benefit  of the colonies which had the happiness to be committed to his care He it was that first taught them the method of cultivating the sugar cane and preparing the sugar He improved the methods which were used in the Brazils for this purpose both with regard to the mills and the furnaces and having given a direction to their industry he gave it all the encouragement he could by supporting those who raised their own substance by the means which advanced the colony whilst he kept a watchful eye and a severe hand upon all who were for making hasty fortunes without adding to the publick stock He made admirable regulations for the speedy and impartial administration of justice and knowing that all order must depend for it's blessing above and it's effect here upon an attention to religion he ordered a proper number of churches to be built in all the islands under his care and settled priests in them with a competent but not a superfluous provision but he did not think monasteries and monks so compatible with a new colony  Under the inspection of this governor Martinico Guardaloupe part of St Christopher's St Bartholomew and St Martin were settled and began to flourish and that with very little help from home A plain proof that almost every thing depends in  affairs of this nature on chusing proper men to command and giving them a proper authority  These islands however were unhappily under the superintendance of an exclusive company which in spite of all that could otherwise be done especially after the death of Richlieu so neglected or mismanaged their affairs that they were obliged to sell a part of the settlements and they left the rest hardly worth purchasing But the government at length bought up the islands which they had alienated and rescued the others out of their hands The trade under proper regulations was laid open yet protected under the wings of their great India company These regulations took place about and the benefits of this arrangement were great and soon apparent Exclusive companies may probably be useful to nourish an infant trade They may be useful too for a very distant one where the market is to be nicely managed and where it is under the dominion of foreign and barbarous princes But where the trade is between different parts of the dominions of the same prince under the protection of his laws carried on by his own subjects and with goods wrought in his own country such companies must be equally absurd in their nature and ruinous in their consequences to the trade  CHAP II  AFTER the Spaniards had ruined the first colony at St Christopher's they brought upon themselves by this act a very heavy revenge for the injustice of it Their example at the same time made it apparent how much better it is to let a bold and adventurous people settle in some place where they can do but little mischief and to suffer their spirit to evaporate in peaceful occupations rather than to keep it up by difficulties unable to quell it but which may force it to take another and more dangerous turn  Several of the French inhabitants who were expelled from St Christopher's being reduced to great indigence began to think of desperate courses They betook themselves to piracy and uniting with some vagrant English Dutch and other outcasts of all nations but resolute fellows and not destitute of men of capacity amongst them they began a piratical war upon the Spaniards At first they satisfied themselves with taking their ships and destroying their trade which they did effectually but soon encouraged and strengthened by this success they landed upon the continent of NewSpain and Terra Firma burning and plundering the open country Their boldness and number increasing with their  success they assaulted and took some of their strongest fortresses and most opulent towns They took Portobello Campeachy Maracaibo Gibraltar and the fortress of Chagra they even took the city of Panama by storm and burned it after defeating an army which came to beat them off In all which places and in the others which they had taken they gained an incredible booty and committed the most unheard of cruelties Another party of these pirates passed the streights of Magellan and entering into the SouthSea turned the whole coast of Peru Chili and the East of Mexico into one scene of desolation every where attended with success because every where acting with a bravery and conduct that in any other cause had merited the highest honours  It is not a little surprising at first view that all the great things which were done in this new world were either done by actual pirates as these men were or by private adventurers but one degree better authorized and nothing better supported whose own courage and skill were to be at once their commission their magazines and their treasury being obliged to find the resources of the war in the war itself When the most numerous and the best provided armaments have shamefully failed and failed in those very places where the adventurers had shewn them such a  glorious example of success But the cause is not so hard to be assigned None but men of great enterprise and bravery conceive those expeditions of themselves Unsupported but at the same time unchecked by the higher powers they were under the necessity of turning to every side and of exerting every faculty But then they had nothing to hinder this exertion Their first attempts were generally low and therefore they were prosperous They did not lead great armies to be subsisted with great difficulty and to be discouraged and wasted by the hardships of the climate but they habituated themselves to hardships by degrees they were encouraged by smaller successes and having nothing to expect from their power and numbers they made amends by their vigilance their activity and their courage These are causes adequate to the effect indeed adequate to any effect Whereas in the regular way a general of the first note and reputation has rarely been sent into America the service seemed beneath him and they that were tolerably expert at second and third parts worse than the absolutely inexperienced for the very first where the scene is new were sent by court favour and intrigue What armaments from England Holland and France have been sent in different times to America whose remains returned without honour or advantage is  too clear and perhaps too invidious a topic to be greatly insisted upon  The pirates whom we called buccaneers improperly the French denominated flibustiers from the Dutch flyboats in which they made their first expeditions The buccaneers are no more than persons who hunt wild cattle in America for their hides and tallow Some of these joined the flibustiers in their first expeditions and from them we named the whole body buccaneers These people brought their prizes and plunder frequently into Jamaica by which they enriched that island extremely Others finding that the Spaniards were very weak in Hispaniola and that they had in a manner deserted a considerable part of the island made it a place of rendezvous They who hunted cattle saw the hideous desarts left by the Spanish tyranny a proper place for exercising their profession To these two sorts of people were soon added a third who were some of the French in the lesser Antilles who finding how much might be made by supplying a sort of people who expended largely and were not very exact in their bargains and perceiving that no part of America afforded a better soil passed over to this island and exercised here their business of planters and merchants These three sorts of people mutually in want of each other lived in very good harmony  The Spaniards dislodged them several times but they still returned and with new strength so that it was with difficulty and after a long dispute that the Spaniards were able to retain one part of the island  The court of France saw the progress of these people silently Whenever complaints were made they disavowed their proceedings resolved not to break measures with Spain for the sake of an object which they were not sure they could hold and the advantages of which were yet doubtful but when they found the French in Hispaniola numerous strong and wealthy they owned them as subjects sent them a governor and regular forces to keep them so and to defend them in what they had done the old method of piracy was still connived at whilst the trade of skins increased and the plantations extended At last the French obtained a legal right by the cession which the Spaniards made them of the NorthWest part of the island by the treaty of Ryswick in the best and most fertile part of the best and most fertile island in the WestIndies and perhaps in the world that which was the first settled and the whole of which is upwards of four hundred miles long and one hundred and forty broad This is the principal settlement of the French in the WestIndies and indeed in all America The country is mixed  pretty mountainous in some parts but many of these mountains are fertile and covered with beautiful woods Others which are barren and rocky anciently had mines of gold they are not worked now though it is judged they not only contain those of gold but mines of silver copper and iron But the French think and I believe with reason that their labour is better bestowed on the culture of the plains for these rich commodities which vend so well in Europe than in the pursuit of mines really more precarious in their profits and which yield a wealth after all of a less useful kind  This country has likewise prodigiously fine plains of a vast extent and extreme fertility either covered with noble and beautiful forests of timber and fruittrees excellent in their kinds or pastured by vast numbers of horned cattle sheep and hogs The air in Hispaniola is of the most healthy in the WestIndies The country is admirably watered with rivulets as well as navigable rivers It is no wonder therefore that this active and industrious nation in possession of so excellent and extensive a country has reaped from it prodigious advantages They were the better enabled to do this from the great encouragement their settlements met with in France and from the wise regulations which were made concerning them These we shall consider in their place But it is certain they  reckoned in the year that on this island they had no less than one hundred thousand negroes and thirty thousand whites that they made sixty thousand hogsheads of sugar of five hundred weight each that the indigo was half as much in value as the sugar that they exported large quantities of cotton and that they had sent besides to France cacao and ginger in tolerable plenty Since that time they raise coffee here to a very great amount Now supposing since that time they have not improved and that they raise no more of these several commodities than they did in which is far from the truth and suppose that the sugar sells but at twenty shillings the hundred yet at that rate the sixty thousand hogsheads must yield three hundred thousand pounds sterling The indigo is somewhat fallen in its prince since this calculation was made but as it certainly has increased largely in its quantity it is not too much to value it at the old rate at one hundred thousand pound If to these we add the produce of the cotton cacao ginger and hides it will not be too much to allow one hundred thousand more This is supposing things no better than they were in the year and at this rate her share of the island is worth to France five hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling a year But if we consider that they are greatly increased since  that time that the sugars are in a higher demand that without lessening any of the old articles that of coffee is in a manner introduced there since that period and now makes a great return it will not be excessive to rate the value of this colony at seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling a year It is true that this part of the French trade suffered greatly in the last war and that the progress of the colony must be somewhat retarded by it Yet allowing all this Hispaniola has certainly increased at least in the measure I allow it  Nations like France and England full of people of spirit and of industry easily recover all the losses of war The trade of France was in a deplorable condition at the treaty of Utrecht She had not then five hundred vessels of all sorts in the world At the beginning of the last war but thirty years after they had eighteen hundred Their losses in that war were very great and yet their losses in this shew that in a very little time they have more than repaired them Wherever the vital principle subsists in full vigour wounds are soon healed Disorders themselves are a species of remedies and every new loss not only shews how it may be repaired but by the vigour it inspires makes new advantages known Such losses renew the spirit of industry and enterprise they reduce things to  their first principles they keep alive motion and make the appetites of traders sharp and keen This is the reason that amidst their continual wars and the losses all the nations of Europe suffer from each other they are almost all thriving And if I may indulge a conjecture it may be one amongst several of the causes that have reduced the trade of Holland that since the treaty of Utrecht now above forty years they have had no war They may during the quarrels of other powers appear to have derived great advantages from their neutrality But are they not with all this declining fast And is not this country which grew to be a nation and to be a powerful trading and rich nation in the midst of the most bloody and expensive wars now losing it's trade it's riches and it's power and almost ceasing to be a nation in the midst of a profound peace of upwards of forty years We must not place our dependance for keeping ourselves on a par of power with France upon the prejudice which we can do it's trade in time of war but upon the vigour oeconomy and wisdom of the of measures which we take to secure and advance our own both in war and in peace  The largest town in the French part of Hispaniola is Cape Francoise which is situated on the Northern part of the island upon a very fine harbour It is well built and  contains about eight thousand inhabitants blacks and whites But though this be largest town Leogane on the Western side a good port too and a place of considerable trade is the seat of government which here resides in the hands of a governor and the intendant who are mutually a check upon each other There are besides two other towns considerable for their trade Petit Guaves on the West end of the island and port Loüis on the SouthWest part  CHAP III  MArtinico is the next island in importance which the French possess in America It is one of the Caribbees or Windward islands and the principal of them about sixty miles in length and at a medium about half as much in breadth It is forty leagues to the NorthWest of Barbadoes It has pretty high hills especially in the inland part From those hills are poured out upon every side a number of agreeable and useful rivulets which adorn and fructify this island in a high degree The bays and harbours are numerous safe and commodious and so well fortified that we have always failed in our attempts upon this place The soil is fruitful enough abounding in the same things which our  islands in that part of the world produce and upon which I shall the less insist on that account Sugar is here as it is in all the islands the principal commodity and great quantities are here made Their export cannot be less than sixty or seventy thousand hogsheads of five or six hundred weight annually and this certainly is no extravagant estimation Indigo cotton piemento or allspice ginger and aloes are raised here and coffee in great abundance but to what value I cannot exactly say Martinico is the residence of the governor of the French islands in these seas  Guardaloupe is the largest of all the Caribbees and in that division called the Leeward islands It is almost cut in two by a deep gulph that closes the sides of a narrow isthmus which connects the two peninsulas that compose this island It is upwards of sixty miles long and about the same breadth It's soil is not inferior to that of Martinico it is equally cultivated and it is fortified with equal strength it's produce is the same with that of Martinico its export of sugar is as great besides indigo cotton and those other commodities which are produced in all the islands of that part of America called the WestIndies  The rest of the French islands in those seas are Desiada St Bartholomew and Marigalante all of them inconsiderable in comparison  of those which we have mentioned They do not all together produce above seven or eight thousand hogsheads of sugar As for the island of St Vincent it is in the possession of the native Americans and of runaway negroes from the rest of the Caribbees The French maintain them in this possession Santa Lucia or as it is often called Sant Alouzie of which the French are themselves in possession and have settled contrary to the faith of treaties it is impossible to say any thing of it's produce it has been so newly planted that it cannot as yet yield a great deal and it is even in our present circumstances much our fault if it ever yields a great deal to France These islands besides their staple commodities send home rocou and brazil wood in considerable quantities for the use of dyers cassia for the druggists and rosewood for joiners The French have a settlement upon an island on the coast of Terra Firma in the province of Guiana which they call Caen and they claim besides a considerable part of the adjacent continent but they have not much extended their settlements that way The island is excessively unhealthy though not so bad as formerly The French here raise the same commodities which they have from the Caribbee islands and in no inconsiderable quantity  In estimating the produce of these islands it is not in my power to be very exact I have made the best enquiries I could and principally took care not to exaggerate I have indeed make the produce of the Caribbee islands very much greater than the ingenious collector of Harris's voyages but then I am the less fearful of differing from him as he seems a little to differ from himself and not to have considered this point with his usual attention for of Martinico he says  "That as it is larger so it has many more inhabitants than Barbadoes and produces more sugars c"  And speaking of Guardaloupe a little lower he observes  "That it produces more sugars than any of the British islands except Jamaica"  and yet afterwards coming to sum up the products of all these islands he allows but fifteen thousand hogsheads of sugar of about six hundred weight each for the whole when he makes the single island of Barbadoes to yield double the quantity of sugars which Martinico Guardaloupe and all the French Caribbees put together produce For he rates it in the year at twentytwo thousand hogsheads and upwards of thirteen hundred weight He must therefore certainly have made some mistake excusable enough in so vast a work which is executed in general in a very masterly manner  On the whole from the best informations I can get if the French do not greatly exceed they certainly do not fall short of our islands in the quantity or goodness of their sugars and it is as certain that they are less on the decline in that trade than we are that they cultivate great quantities of indigo a trade which our colonies in the West Indies have entirely lost that within these few years they have sent to France abundance of coffee which our islands have not sufficient encouragement to raise and that upon the whole we have the greatest reason to be jealous of France in that part of the world What advantages they derive from the noble island of Hispaniola we have seen What must they do if they come to possess the whole of that island which in the cutting and shuffling of a treaty of peace is no way impossible We shall then change the indolent Spaniard for the neighbourhood of the lively vigilant and enterprising French And what a rivalry in peace and what a danger in war that neighbourhood is even now and much more will probably be is but too apparent Jamaica is near it and for so valuable a possession in so dangerous a situation perhaps not so well defended If besides this the French should retain the islands of St Vincent St Lucia and Tobago though they should only turn them into plantations for fire wood lumber and provisions as in such a case it  would seem most adviseable to do with some of them at least what an advantage to their colonies what an annoyance to ours which they in a manner surround and can in a sort hold besieged by the private armaments they may from thence fit out  These last mentioned islands were left neutral at the last peace or in other words they were left at the extinction of the old in just the order proper for kindling a new flame though such a design I am convinced was far from the intentions of one of the parties and in all respects as if things were expressly ordered for that very purpose Indeed nothing can be attended with worse consequences than these political afterreckonings which the party who has the advantage at making the peace never finds it his account to settle or adjust but there they lie full of matter of litigation full of idle occasions for formal business full of strife and of ill blood and when a proper time occurs of bloody and expensive wars It were better at any rate all at once to know what we are to depend upon the best or the worst we have to expect If on the conclusion of a peace things should take for us such an unfortunate turn we have still great resources in the territories we possess Jamaica is nothing like fully cultivated The Bahamas our undisputed right where it is highly probable sugars might be cultivated to advantage remain  at present utterly neglected as if unworthy of all notice though they are many in number large in extent fruitful in their soil situated in a very happy climate and are in a manner the keys of the WestIndia navigation But we shall pass by all reflections on this subject for the present to look at the possessions and claims of France upon the continent which if they were as well cultivated as they are fruitful and extensive or as convenient objects of the French industry as their islands they would I make no doubt be at least as advantageous to the trade and add as much to the wealth and power of that flourishing kingdom  CHAP IV  THE French possessions and claims in NorthAmerica consist of an immense inland country communicating with the sea by the mouths of two great rivers both of difficult and dangerous navigation at the entrance and one of which is quite frozen for almost half the year and covered with thick exhalations and fogs for the greater part of the rest They divide this vast country which has our colonies on the East and NorthEast the Spanish on the SouthWest and SouthEast and to the Westward that unknown tract of land which stretches to the SouthSea into two great provinces the Northern of which they call Canada and the Southern Louisiana But how far the bounds of these countries extended to dimensions almost as great as all Europe by the ambition of France ought to be contracted by the rights of other powers I shall not undertake to determine as after all such questions must be decided in a manner altogether different from any thing that can be said here  Canada which borders upon our provinces of NovaScotia NewEngland and NewYork is of a climate not altogether different from theirs but as it is much further from the sea and more Northerly than a great part of those provinces it has a much  severer winter though the air is generally clear The soil is various mostly barren but the French have settlements where the land is equal in goodness to that in any of our colonies and wants nothing but a better convenience of market to make it equally advantageous to the proprietors It yields Indian corn very well in most parts and very fine wheat in some All sorts of garden stuff which grows in Europe flourishes here But they raise no staple commodity to answer their demands upon Old France their trade with the Indians produces all their returns for that market They are the furrs of the beaver principally and those of foxes and racoons with deerskins and all the branches of the Peltry These with what corn and lumber they send to the WestIndies to a people not very luxurious nor extremely numerous furnish though very little money yet wherewithal in a plentiful country to render life easy and agreeable  The nature of the climate severely cold for the most part and the people manufacturing nothing shews what the country wants from Europe wine brandy cloths chiefly coarse linen and wrought iron The Indian trade requires brandy tobacco a sort of duffil blankets guns powder and ball kettles hatchets and tomahawks with several toys and trinkets The Indians supply the Peltry and the French have traders  whom they call coureurs de bois who in the manner of the original inhabitants traversing the vast lakes and rivers that divide this country in canoes of bark with incredible industry and patience carry their goods into the remotest parts of America and amongst nations entirely unknown to us This again brings the market home to them as the Indians are hereby habituated to trade with them For this purpose people from all parts even from the distance of a thousand miles come to the French fair of MontReal which is held in June On this occasion many solemnities are observed guards are placed and the governor assists to preserve order in such a concourse of such a variety of savage nations The trade is now in that channel for though many if not most of these nations actually pass by our settlement of Albany in NewYork where they may have the goods they want cheaper considerably than at MontReal they travel on above two hundred miles further to buy the same commodities at the second hand and enhanced by the expence of so long a land carriage at the French fair For the French find it cheaper to buy our goods from the NewYork merchants than to have them from their own after so bad and so tedious a passage as it is from the mouth of the river St Laurence to MontReal So much do the French exceed us in industry oeconomy and  the arts of conciliating the affections of mankind things that even ballance all the disadvantages they naturally labour under in this country Our fort of Oswego was well planned for securing the Indian trade and actually brought us a great part of it But it is now no longer an interruption to the French commerce  Having mentioned MontReal I have only to observe that this town is situated in an island in the river of St Laurence in the country of the Iroquois The river is only navigable hither by canoes or small craft having several falls between this town and Quebec Yet this Indian fair and the trade of the same kind which they drive more or less for the whole year make it no inconsiderable place It contains about three thousand inhabitants  Quebec the capital lies many leagues nearer the sea from which however it is one hundred and fifty leagues distant The river which from the sea hither is ten or twelve miles broad narrows all of a sudden to about a mile wide The town is divided into an upper and a lower In both the fortifications are strong and the houses well built They have a grand cathedral and episcopal palace a handsome college of jesuits three monasteries of men and as many of women and the town is covered by a regular and  beautiful citadel in which the governor resides This city though the capital of Canada is however not very large It contains about seven or eight thousand inhabitants at the utmost Ships of any burthen load and unload here and a good many are built  From Quebec to MontReal which is about one hundred and fifty miles distance the country on both sides the river is very well settled and has an agreeable effect upon the eye The farms lie pretty close all the way several gentlemen's houses neatly built shew themselves at intervals and there is all the appearance of a flourishing colony but there are no towns or villages It is pretty much like the wellsettled parts of our colonies of Virginia and Maryland where the planters are wholly within themselves  With all the attention of the court of France to the trade and peopling of this as well as their other colonies on the continent they have not been yet able thoroughly to overcome the consequences of those difficulties which the climate whilst the place was unsettled threw in their way their losses in the wars with that brave and fierce nation the Iroquois who more than once reduced their colony to the last extremity and the bad navigation of the river St Laurence which is an evil incurable have kept back the colony Therefore though it is the oldest of all the French establishments  and prior to our settlement of NewEngland the inhabitants are not above one hundred thousand souls Some indeed of late reckon them but at forty thousand An error this very prejudicial to our affairs whilst we overvalued our own strength and underrated the force of the enemy and acted in a good measure in conformity to such ideas but even this number as I estimate it which I believe is not far from the reality might be no just cause of dread to our colonies if they managed the strength they have and which is certainly much superior with skill and effect The French from theirs though inferior have seven or eight thousand militia hardy and well disciplined always in readiness to cooperate with their regular troops and there is nothing which may hinder or retard their operations from within themselves It is therefore not more the French intrigues and their intermarriages with the Indians which fix that people in the French interest than the succours which they are always sure to have from such a force ever in readiness to protect them whilst they remain their friends or to punish them whenever they dare to appear as enemies With us the case is quite otherwise This savage people commence hostilities against us without any previous notice and often without any provocation they commit the most horrid ravages for a long time  with impunity But when at last their barbarities have roused the sleeping strength of our people at the same time too that they have considerably lessened it they are not ashamed to beg a peace they know we always grant it readily they promise it shall endure as long as the sun and moon and then all is quiet till the French intrigues cooperating with our indolence give them once more an opportunity of ravaging our colonies and of once more renewing a peace to be broken like all the former  The great river St Laurence is that only upon which the French have settlements of any note but if we look forward into futurity it is nothing improbable that this vast country whoever then shall be the possessors of it will be enabled of itself to carry on a vast trade upon these great seas of fresh water which it environs Here are five lakes the smallest of which is a piece of sweet water greater than any in the other parts of the world this is the lake Ontario which is not less than two hundred leagues in circumference Erie longer but not so broad is about the same extent That of the Hurons spreads greatly in width and is in circumference not less than three hundred as is that of Michigan though like lake Erie it is rather long and comparatively narrow But  the lake Superior which contains several large islands is five hundred leagues in the circuit All of these are navigable by any vessels and they all communicate with one another except that the passage between Erie and Ontario is interrupted by the stupendous cataract of Niagara where the water tumbles down a precipice of twentysix fathom high and makes in this fall a thundering noise which is heard all round the country at the distance of several miles The river St Laurence is the outlet of these lakes by this they discharge themselves into the ocean The French have built forts at the several straits by which these lakes communicate with each other as well as where the last of them communicates with the river St Laurence By these they effectually secure to themselves the trade of the lakes and an influence upon all the nations of Americans which confine upon them  They have but one settlement more in the Northern part of their territories in America which deserves consideration but that settlement though a small one is perhaps of more consequence than all the rest It is the island of Cape Breton This island properly belongs to the division of Acadia or NovaScotia and it is the only part of it which has not been ceded by treaty to GreatBritain It is about one hundred and forty miles in length  full of mountains and lakes and intersected by a vast number of creeks and bays almost meeting each other upon every side which seems in general both for the coast and inland very much to resemble the coast and inland parts of most Northern countries Scotland is so so is Iceland and Denmark and Sweden have such shores such mountains and such lakes However the soil is in many places sufficiently fruitful and in every part abounds with timber fit for all uses In the earth are coalpits and on the shores one of the most valuable fisheries in the world The only town in this island is Louisbourg It stands upon one of the finest harbours in all America This harbour is four leagues in circumference landlocked every way but at the mouth which is narrow and within there is fine anchorage every where in seven fathom water The town itself is of a tolerable size and well built and fortified The harbour is defended by batteries of cannon and forts which secure it at this day perhaps too effectually This harbour is open the whole year The French ships that carry goods to Quebec can very seldom get their full loading there therefore on their return they put into Louisbourg and there take in a quantity of fish coal and some lumber and then sail away to the French islands in the WestIndies where they vend these and soon  complete their cargo with sugars It is needless to observe that this island was taken by us in the late war but restored by the treaty of Aix la Chapelle in which we certainly were not in such a condition as to intitle us to prescribe the terms  CHAP V  THE French have called the South part of the vast tract which they claim in America Louisiana It was heretofore a part of Florida It is bounded by the gulph of Mexico upon the South But what bounds it is to have to the East and to the West it is to be wished the next treaty of peace may settle definitively This is in all respects a much finer country than Canada in a delicious climate capable of bearing almost any thing from the temper of the sky and the goodness of the soil and from the multitude of long deep and beautiful rivers with which it is every where enriched and adorned these are most of them navigable for hundreds of miles into the country They are principally the Missisippi whose head is unknown but it almost goes quite through North America and at certain seasons overflows it's banks for a vast way on both sides The Ohio a river almost equal to the Danube which falls  into the Missisippi the Ouabache scarce inferior to the Ohio the great rivers Alibama Mobile and several others The face of the country is almost wholly plain covered with stately woods or spread into very fine meadows In short Louisiana particularly the Northern part for the mouth of the Missisippi is barren without any of these heightenings which it received when it was made the instrument to captivate so many to their ruin is in all respects a most desirable place though there be no sufficient reasons to believe that it contains any rich metals which gave it the greatest influence in that remarkable delusion in  I know not how it has happened but it has been the fate of this country to create romantic ideas at all times Very surprising stories were told of it when first the Spaniards discovered the WestIndia islands Amongst others a notion was generally current that there was a fountain here which perpetually renewed the youth of those who drank it This was so uniformly and confidently affirmed that Juan Pontio de Leon a considerable man amongst the Spanish adventurers gave credit to it and made a particular expedition for the discovery of that fairy land and that fountain of youth He was the first of the Europeans who landed in Florida But what success soever he met in his search for that  celebrated spring it is certain he died not long after having searched every part of the country and drank of almost every water it contained Nor do I find that so invaluable a spring is yet discovered there if it were it would undoubtedly be the best commodity the country could yield both for domestic consumption and for the foreign markets and would be a far better basis for stocks and funds than the richest mines of gold or silver Yet without this an idea altogether as romantic of a trade hither operated so strongly upon a very wise nation as to serve for the instrument of one of those dangerous masterstrokes in politics by which nations are sometimes saved individuals undone and an entire change and reversement brought about not only in the common ways of thinking of mankind but of all that seemed most fixed and permanent in a state The famous Missisippi scheme in France was of this nature and built upon such a romantic foundation It is well known to all the world both on it's own account and upon account of a similar madness that prevailed here without perhaps being attended with such advantageous consequences  The French settled in Louisiana raise some indigo a good deal of cotton some corn and rice with lumber for their islands but the colony is not very vigorous on account of the  shoals and sands with which the mouth of the river Missisippi is in a manner choaked up and which deny access to vessels of any considerable burthen This keeps the inhabitants low but the cause which keeps them from growing rich contributes too to their security for it is not easy to act with any great force upon that side But the French have not relied upon this advantage but according to their usual cautious and wise custom have erected several forts in the most material places and fortified New Orleans their capital and indeed only city in Louisiana in a regular manner This city is not remarkably fair large or rich The whole colony is said not to contain above ten thousand souls whites and negroes Yet with all it's disadvantages this colony is not declining and if ever they should make the mouth of the Missisippi more tractable and what is impossible to ambition and industry if they should come to fully possess and settle the Ohio which at one season overflows and makes such flood as to level all the falls almost from it's very source to the mouth of the Missisippi and gives a passage all that way to very considerable vessels though they have not quite the same easy return and if by this and other means they should contrive a communication between Canada and the settlement at Louisiana whilst they entirely confine us between our mountains and the sea  Louisiana in a few years will wear quite another face It will supply their WestIndies with boards staves horses mules and provisions It will send tobacco into France and increasing the conveniencies of it's mother country and sister colonies it will increase it's own traffic it's inhabitants and it's power We have seen how the French WestIndies in less than forty years from a condition which could excite no other sentiments than those of compassion are risen to such a pitch as to be an object of great and just terror to her neighbours and we now feel too that the French settlements in North America even such as they are are not an undermatch for the whole force of our's in the manner at least in which that force is exerted  CHAP VI  THAT we may not sit down in a senseless admiration of this progress of the French colonies as if it were the work of fortune it will not be amiss to open something of the wise plan of conduct which France has pursued with regard to this interesting object Sensible that as the mother country is to receive ultimately all the benefits of their labours and acquisitions so all the prosperity of their plantations must be derived  from the attention with which they are regarded at home For which reason the plantations are particularly under the care and inspection of the council of commerce a board very judiciously constituted to answer the purposes for which it is designed For to give it a proper respect and authority it is composed of twelve of the most considerable officers of the crown and then to enable it to judge perfectly of the matters which come before it these twelve are assisted by the deputies of all the considerable trading towns and cities in France who are chosen out of the richest and most intelligent of their traders and paid an handsome salary for their attendance at Paris from the funds of their respective cities This council sits once a week The deputies propose plans for redressing every grievance in trade for raising the branches that are fallen for extending new ones for supporting the old and in fine for every thing that may improve the working or promote the vent of their manufactures according to their own lights or to the instructions of their constituents They have a watchful eye upon every article of commerce and they not only propose helps and improvements to it themselves but they hear the proposals of others which are not disdainfully rejected nor rashly received They do not render the access to them difficult by swelling themselves into a  stiff and unwieldy state They do not discourage those who apply by admitting the vexatious practice of fees perquisites and exactions in their inferior officers They do not suffer form and methods to load and encumber that business they were solely intended to advance They summon and examine those who are supposed the most competent judges of the matter before them and of every part of it even the lowest artizans but though they examine those men they are instructed by their experience not determined by their opinion When they are satisfied of the usefulness of any regulation they propose it to the royal council where their report is always received with particular attention An edict to enforce it issues accordingly and it is executed with a punctuality which distinguishes their government and which alone can make the wisest regulations any thing better than serious mockeries To the care of this excellent body the plantations are particularly entrusted  The government of the several divisions of their colonies is in a governor an intendant and a royal council The governor is invested with a great deal of power which however on the side of the crown is checked by the intendant who has the care of the king's rights and whatever relates to the revenue and on the side of the people it is  checked by the royal council whose office it is to see that the people are not oppressed by the one nor defrauded by the other and they are all checked by the constant and jealous eye which the government at home keeps over them For the officers at all the ports of France are charged under the several penalties to interrogate all captains of ships coming from the colonies concerning the reception they met at the ports they were bound to how justice was administred to them what charges they were made liable to and of what kinds The passengers and even the sailors are examined upon these heads and a verbal process of the whole is formed and transmitted with all speed to the admiralty Complaints are encouraged but a difference is made between hearing an accusation and condemning upon it  That the colonies may have as little load as possible and that the governor may have less temptation to stir up troublesome intrigues or favour factions in his government his salary is paid by the crown His perquisites are none and he is strictly forbidden to carry on any trade or to have any plantations in the islands or on the continent or any interest whatsoever in goods or lands within his government except the house he lives in and a garden for his convenience and recreation All the other officers are  paid by the crown and out of the revenues of Old France the fortification are built and repaired and the soldiers are paid out of the same funds  In general the colonies pay no taxes but when upon an extraordinary emergency taxes have been raised they were very moderate And that even the taxes might operate for the advancement of the colony they who began new plantations were exempted from them The duties upon the export of their produce at the islands or at it's import into France is next to nothing in both places hardly making two per cent What commodities go to them pay no duties at all  Besides these advantages a considerable benefit accrues to such of the colonies as are poor as Canada by the money which comes from France to support the establishment This brings into Canada about crowns a year which finds them circulating cash preserves them from the dangerous expedient of a paper currency enables them to keep up their intercourse with some credit with their mother country and at the same time is in fact no loss at all to it since the money returns home almost as soon as it can possibly be transported back again  In all their islands judges of the admiralty are appointed to decide in a summary manner all disputes between merchants and whatsoever  else has any relation to trade These judges are strictly examined before they are appointed particularly as to their skill in the marine laws which have been improved and digested in France with so much care and good sense that all law suits are quickly over though in other respects the practice of law admits of as much chicanery and has as many if not more delays than with us  After having taken such precautions to secure the good government of the colony within itself and to make it's communication with the mother country easy and beneficial to both sides all would be to very little purpose if they had not provided with equal care to have the country replenished with people To answer this end they oblige every ship which departs from France for America to carry a certain number of indented servants All vessels of sixty tuns or under are to carry three from sixty to a hundred four and from a hundred upwards six servants sound strong bodies between the ages of eighteen and forty Before their departure the servants are examined by the officers of the admiralty to see whether they are the persons required by law an examination to the same purpose is made by the commissary on their landing in America They are to serve three years The avarice of the planters makes them always prefer negroe  slaves because they are more obedient than the Europeans may be more worked are subsisted with less difficulty and are besides the entire property of their master This disposition in time would render the safety of the colony extremely precarious whilst it made the colony itself of less value to the mother country Therefore the planters are by law obliged to keep a certain number of white servants in proportion to their blacks and the execution of this law is inforced by the commissary who adjusts the price and forces the planters to take the number of servants required by the ordinance who would otherwise be a burthen upon the hands of the masters of ships who brought them over  They consider the planter as a Frenchman venturing his life enduring a species of banishment and undergoing great hardships for the benefit of his country For which reasons he has great indulgence shewn him Whenever by hurricanes earthquakes or bad seasons the planters suffer a stop is put to the rigour of exacting creditors the few taxes which are levied are remitted and even money is advanced to repair their losses and set them forward To those who are poor but shew a disposition to industry necessaries and small sums are lent to make a beginning and this money is taken in gradually and by very small payments On the other hand as it  can be of no advantage to the planter to run fraudulently into debt but that it is of the greatest prejudice to the French merchant all debts though contracted by the planters in France are levied with great ease The process properly authenticated is transmitted to America and admitted as proved there and levied on the planter's estate of whatsoever kind it may be However care is taken that whilst compulsory methods are used to make the planter do justice the state shall not lose the industry of an useful member of the community the debt is always levied according to the substance of the debtor and by installments so that what ought indeed to be the case in every wellregulated government one of the parties is not sacrificed to the other Both subsist the creditor is satisfied the debtor is not ruined and the credit of the colonies is kept in health and vigour at home by the sure methods which are in use for recovering all demands in the plantations  As to the negroes they are not left as they are with us wholly body and soul to the discretion of the planter Their masters are obliged to have them instructed in the principles of religion There are methods taken at once to protect the slaves from the cruelty of their owners and to preserve the colony from the ill effects that might arise from treating them with a lenity not consistent with  their condition In short the Code Noir and other ordinances relative to these poor creatures shew a very just and sensible mixture of humanity and steadiness There is however one error their planters commit in common with ours which is that they overwork these unhappy men in a manner not suitable to the nature of the climate or to their constitutions  I have dwelt the longer upon the French policy as it regards their colonies because it is just to give due honour to all those who advance the intercourse of mankind the peopling of the earth and the advantage of their country by wise and effectual regulations But I principally insist upon it that it may if possible serve for an example to ourselves that it may excite an emulation in us that it may help to rouse us out of that languor into which we seem to be fallen The war we now carry on principally regards our colonies and is a sufficient proof that we are come at last to know their value But if we are not to hope for better success than has hitherto attended a very just cause the next peace will probably contract the field we hoped to lay open to our industry in America But then we ought therefore to cultivate what still remains of it with tenfold industry we ought to guard with the most unremitting vigilance that enclosed spring that sealed fountain the waters of  which we reserve to ourselves and direct into such channels and make to pursue such windings and turnings as best serve our purposes We have I believe pretty well discovered most of our errors and the advantage our enemy and rival has taken not only of our supineness but of a contrary genius in his own councils We ought to rouse ourselves from the former and prepare to imitate the latter Our business is to fight against Alexander not to rail at him And truly I do not know any thing that for this long time past has contributed more to degrade our character for humanity in the eyes of foreigners or to instil into ourselves a low and illiberal way of thinking than that vein of licentious scurrility and abuse by which in all sorts of writings we are apt to vilify and traduce the French nation There is nothing which hinders people from acting properly more than indulging themselves in a vain and effeminate licence of tongue A man who loves his country and can at once oppose and esteem an enemy would view our present circumstances in a light I conceive somewhat like the following We have been engaged for above a century with France in a noble contention for the superiority in arms in politics in learning and in commerce and there never was a time perhaps when this struggle was more critical If we succeed in the war even our  success unless managed with prudence will be like some former successes of little benefit to us if we should fail which God forbid even then prudence may make our misfortunes of more use to us than an illmanaged success if they teach us to avoid our former errors if they make us less careless if they make us cultivate the advantages we have with care and judgment This and not our opinion of the enemy must decide the long contest between us  CHAP VII The Dutch Settlements  AFTER the Portuguese had dispossessed the Dutch of Brazil in the manner we have seen and after the treaty of Nimeguen had entirely removed them out of North America they were obliged to console themselves with their rich possessions in the EastIndies and to sit down content in the West with Surinam a country on the NorthEast part of SouthAmerica and of no great value whilst we had it and which we ceded to them in exchange for NewYork and with two or three small and barren islands in the Northsea not far from the Spanish main The former of these they are far from neglecting they raise some sugar in Surinam a great deal of cotton coffee of an excellent kind and  some valuable dying drugs They trade with our North American colonies who bring hither horses live cattle and provisions and take home a large quantity of molasses but their negroes are only the refuse of those they have for the Spanish market and the Indians in their neighbourhood are their mortal enemies On the same continent they have three other settlements at no considerable distance from each other Boron Berbice and Approwack none very great but producing the same commodities with Surinam  The islands which they possess are four Curassou St Eustatia Aruba and Bonaire none of them large or fertile but turned to the best advantage possible by that spirit of industry for which the Dutch are so justly famous Curaccao or Curassou as it is generally called is about thirty miles long and ten in breath Though it is naturally barren it produces a considerable quantity both of sugar and tobacco and here are besides very great saltworks which furnish a good deal to the English islands and for which there is a considerable demand from our colonies on the continent but the trade for which this island is chiefly valuable is that which in time of war is carried on between them the English and the French and the counterband which is carried on between them and the Spaniards at all times  The Dutch vessels from Europe touch at this island for intelligence or proper pilots and then proceed to the Spanish coast upon a trade which they force with a strong hand It is very difficult for the Spanish guarda costas to take these vessels for they are not only stout ships with a number of guns but by a very wise policy manned with a large crew of chosen seamen who are all deeply interested in the safety of the vessel and the success of the voyage They have each a share in the cargo of a value proportioned to the owner's station supplied by the merchants upon credit and at prime cost This animates them with an uncommon courage they fight bravely because every man fights in defence of his own property But there is besides this a constant intercourse between the Spanish continent and this island  The island of Curassou has it's numerous warehouses always full of the commodities of Europe and the EastIndies Here are all sorts of woollen and linen cloths laces silks ribbands utensils of iron naval and military stores brandy the spices of the Moluccas and the callicoes of India white and painted Hither the WestIndia which is likewise their African company bring three or four cargoes of slaves annually To this mart the Spaniards come themselves in small vessels and carry off not only the best of their negroes  and at the best price but very great quantities of all the sorts of goods I have mentioned with this advantage to the seller that the refuse of warehouses and mercers shops things grown utterly unfashionable and unsaleable in Europe go off extremely well where every thing is sufficiently recommended by being European They leave here their gold and silver in bars or coined cacao vanilla cochineal jesuit's bark hides and other valuable commodities The ships that trade directly from Holland to the Spanish continent as they touch here on their outward passage to gain intelligence or assistance on their return put in here likewise to compleat what is wanting of their cargo with the sugar the tobacco the ginger and other produce of the island itself The trade of this island even in times of peace is reputed to be worth to the Dutch no less than l sterl annually but in time of war the profit is far greater for then it is in a manner the common emporium of the WestIndies it affords a retreat to the ships of all nations and at the same time refuses to none of them arms and ammunition to annoy one another The intercourse with Spain being interrupted the Spanish colonies have scarce any other market from whence they can be well supplied either with slaves or goods the French come hither to buy the beef pork corn flour and lumber which  the English bring from the continent of North America or which is transported from Ireland so that whether in peace or in war the trade of this island flourishes extremely Nor is this owing to any natural advantage whatsoever It seems as if it were fated that the ingenuity and patience of the Hollanders should every where both in Europe and America be employed in fighting against an unfriendly nature for the island is not only barren and dependent upon the rains for it's water but the harbour is naturally one of the worst in America but the Dutch have entirely remedied that defect they have upon this harbour one of the largest and by far the most elegant and cleanly towns in the American islands The public buildings are numerous and handsome the private houses commodious and the magazines large convenient and well filled All kind of labour is here performed by engines some of them so dextrously contrived that ships are at once lifted into the dock where they are compleatly careened and then furnished with naval stores provisions cannon and every thing requisite either for trade or war  Eustatia is but one mountain of about twenty miles in compass it is amongst the Leeward islands but though so small and inconveniently laid out by nature the industry of the Dutch have made it turn out to very good account and it is fully peopled the sides of the  mountain are divided and laid out in very pretty settlements and though they have neither springs nor rivers they are so careful that they never want proper supplies of water from their ponds and cisterns They raise here sugar and tobacco and this island as well as Curassou is engaged in the Spanish counterband trade for which however it is not so well situated and it draws the same advantages from it's constant neutrality  As for Aruba and Bonaire they lie near Curassou and have no trade of consequence they are chiefly employed in raising fresh provisions for the principal island and for the refreshment of such ships as use these seas  The trade of all the Dutch American settlements was originally carried on by the WestIndia company only At present such ships as go upon that trade pay two and a half per cent For their licences the company however reserves to itself the whole of what is carried on between Africa and the American islands  The Danes had likewise a WestIndia company though it's object was far from extensive It was little more than the island of St Thomas an inconsiderable member of the Caribbees lately they have added to their possessions the island of Santa Cruz in the same cluster These islands so long as they remained in the hands of the company were ill managed and nothing like the proper advantage  was made of them but the present king of Denmark inferior to none who ever sat upon that or any other throne in love to his subjects and a judicious zeal for promoting their welfare has bought up that company's stock and laid the trade open Since then the old settlement at St Thomas is very much improved it produces upwards of three thousand hogsheads of sugar at a thousand weight each and others of the WestIndian commodities in tolerable plenty and as for Santa Cruz from a perfect desart a few years since it is beginning to settle fast several persons from the English islands and amongst them some of great wealth have gone to settle there and have received very great encouragement to do so The air of the place is extremely unhealthful but this ill disposition will probably continue no longer than the woods with which the island at present is almost wholly covered These two nations the Dutch and Danes hardly deserve to be mentioned amongst the proprietors of America their possessions there are comparatively nothing But as they appear extremely worthy of the attention of these powers and as the share of the Dutch is worth to them at least six hundred thousand pounds sterling a year what must we think of our possessions What attention do they not deserve from us and what may not be made of them by that attention  There seems to be a remarkable providence in the casting the parts if I may use that expression of the several European nations who act upon the stage of America The Spaniards proud lazy and magnificent has an ample walk in which to expatiate a soft climate to indulge his love of ease and a profusion of gold and silver to procure him all these luxuries his pride demands but which his laziness would refuse him  The Portuguese naturally indigent at home and enterprising rather than industrious abroad has gold and diamonds as the Spaniard has wants them as he does but possesses them in a more useful though a less ostentatious manner  The English of a reasoning disposition thoughtful and cool and men of business rather than of great industry impatient of much fruitless labour abhorrent of constraint and lovers of a country life have a lot which indeed produces neither gold nor silver but they have a large tract of a fine continent a noble field for the exercise of agriculture and sufficient to furnish their trade without laying them under great difficulties Intolerant as they are of the most useful restraints their commerce flourishes from the freedom every man has of pursuing it according to his own ideas and directing his life after his own fashion  The French active lively enterprizing pliable and politic and though changing their pursuits always pursuing the present object with eagerness are notwithstanding tractable and obedient to rules and laws which bridle these dispositions and wind and turn them to proper courses This people have a country where more is to be effected by managing the people than by cultivating the ground where a pedling commerce that requires constant motion flourishes more than agriculture or a regular traffic where they have difficulties which keep them alert by struggling with them and where their obedience to a wise government serves them for personal wisdom In the islands the whole is the work of their policy and a right turn their government has taken  The Dutch have got a rock or two on which to display the miracles of frugality and diligence which are their virtues and on which they have exerted these virtues and shewn those miracles  PART VI The English Settlements  CHAP I  THE English colonies are the fairest objects of our attention in America not only as they comprehend a vast and delightful variety of climates situations natural products and effects of art but as they contain though the dominions of one potentate and their inhabitants formed out of the people of one nation an almost equal variety of manners religions and ways of living They have a most flourishing trade with their mother country and they communicate widely with many foreign nations for besides the constant and useful intercourse they hold with Africa their ships are seen in the ports of Spain Portugal Italy and even in the Levant nor are they excluded the American settlements of France Spain Portugal and  Holland This with their constant correspondence with each other and with their mother country hurries about a lively circulation of trade of which Great Britain is the heart and spring from whence it takes it's rise and to which it all returns in the end  In some of the European settlements we have seen the effects of a vast ambition supported by surprizing feats of a romantic courage mixed with an insatiable thirst of gold In others the regular product of a systematic policy tempering and guiding an active industry but in our own colonies we are to display the effects of liberty the work of a people guided by their own genius and following the directions of their own natural temper in a proper path  I intend to consider the English colonies under two principal divisions the first I allot to those islands which lie under the torrid zone between the tropic of Cancer and the Equinoctial line in that part generally called the WestIndies The second is to comprehend ou  possessions in the temperate zone on the con+tinent of North America The WestIndi  islands shall be considered as they are amongs  the greater Antilles the Windward or th  Leeward islands Amongst the first we pos+sess the large and noble island of Jamai+ca amongst the second we have Barba+does and in the third division St Christo+pher's  Antegua Nevis Montserrat and Barbuda As all these islands lie between the tropics whatever is to be said of the air winds meteors and natural produce shall fall under one head as they are the same or nearly the same in all of them their produce for the market is nearly the same too and therefore whatever is to be said of the manufacturing of those shall come together after we have given a concise description of the state of each island separately  Jamaica lies between the th and th degree of West longitude from London and is between seventeen and nineteen degrees distant from the Equinoctial It is in length from East to West a hundred and forty English miles and in breadth about sixty and of an oval form This country is in a manner intersected with a ridge of lofty mountains rugged and rocky that are called the blue mountains On each side of the blue mountains are chains of lesser mountains gradually lower The greater mountains are little better than so many rocks where there is any earth it is only a stubborn clay fit for no sort of husbandry The mountains are very steep and the rocks tumbled upon one another in a manner altogether stupendous the effect of the frequent earthquakes which have shaken this island in all times Yet barren as these mountains are they are all covered to the very top  with a great variety of beautiful trees flourishing in a perpetual spring their roots penetrate the crannies of the rocks and search out the moisture which is lodged there by the rains that fall so frequently on these mountains and the mists that almost perpetually brood upon them These rocks too are the parents of a vast number of fine rivulets which tumble down their sides in cataracts that form amongst the rudeness of the rocks and precipices and the shining verdure of the trees the most wildly pleasing imagery imaginable The face of this country is a good deal different from what is generally observed in other places For as on one hand the mountains are very steep so the plains between them are perfectly smooth and level In these plains the soil augmented by the wash of the mountains for so many ages is prodigiously fertile None of our islands produce so fine sugars They formerly had here cacao in great perfection which delights in a rich ground Their pastures after the rains are of a most beautiful verdure and extraordinary fatness They are called Savannas On the whole if this island were not troubled with great thunders and lightnings hurricanes and earthquakes and if the air was not at once violently hot damp and extremely unwholsome in most parts the fertility and beauty of this country would make it as desirable a  situation for pleasure as it is for the profits which in spite of these disadvantages draw hither such a number of people  The river waters are many of them unwholsome and taste of copper but some springs there are of a better kind In the plains are found several salt fountains and in the mountains not far from Spanishtown is a hot bath of extraordinary medicinal virtues It relieves in the dry bellyach one of the most terrible endemial distempers of Jamaica and in various other complaints  This island came into our possession during the usurpation of Cromwell and by means of an armament which had another destination Cromwell notwithstanding the great abilities which enabled him to overturn the constitution and to trample upon the liberties of his country was not sufficiently acquainted with foreign politics This ignorance made him connect himself closely with France then rising into a dangerous grandeur and to fight with great animosity the shadow which remained of the Spanish power On such ideas he fitted out a formidable fleet with a view to reduce the island of Hispaniola and though he failed in this design Jamaica made amends not only for this failure but almost for the ill policy which first drew him into hostilities with the Spaniards by which  however he added this excellent country to the British dominions  There was nothing of the genius of Cromwell to be seen in the planning of this expedition From the first to the last all was wrong all was a chain of little interested mismanagement and had no air of the result of absolute power lodged in great hands The fleet was ill victualled the troops ill provided with necessaries to support and encourage men badly chosen and worse armed They embarked in great discontent The generals were but little better satisfied and had little more hopes than the soldiers But the generals for there were two in the command Pen and Venables one for the marine the other for the land service were men of no extraordinary talents And if they had been men of the best capacity little was to be expected from two commanders not subordinate and so differing in their ideas and so envious of each other as land and seaofficers generally are But to make this arrangement perfect in all respects and to improve the advantages arising from a divided command they added a number of commissioners as a check upon both This tripartite generalship in the truest Dutch taste produced the effects that might be expected from it The soldiers differed with the generals the generals disagreed with one another and all quarrelled  with the commissioners The place of their landing in Hispaniola was ill chosen and the manner of it wretchedly contrived The army had forty miles to march before it could act and the soldiers without order without heart fainting and dying by the excessive heat of the climate and the want of necessary provisions and disheartened yet more by the cowardice and discontent of their officers yielded an easy victory to an handful of Spaniards They retired ignominiously and with great loss  But the principal commanders a little reconciled by their misfortunes and fearing to return to England without effect very wisely turned their thoughts another way They resolved to attempt Jamaica before the inhabitants of that island could receive encouragement by the news of their defeat in Hispaniola They knew that this island was in no good posture of defence and they set themselves vigorously to avoid the mistakes which proved so fatal in the former expedition They severely punished the officers who had shewn an ill example by their cowardice and they ordered with respect to the soldiers that if any attempted to run away the man nearest to him should shoot him  Fortified with these regulations they landed in Jamaica and laid siege to St Jago de la Vega now called Spanishtown the capital of the island The people who were in no  condition to oppose an army of ten thousand men and a strong naval force would have surrendered immediately if they had not been encouraged by the strange delays of our generals and their commissioners However at last the town with the whole island surrendered but not until the inhabitants had secreted their most valuable effects in the mountains  CHAP II  AFTER the restoration the Spaniards ceded the island to our court Cromwell had settled there some of the troops employed in it's reduction some royalists uneasy at home sought an asylum in this island not a few planters from Barbadoes were invited to Jamaica by the extraordinary fertility of the soil and the other various advantages which it offered These latter taught the former settlers the manner of raising the sugar cane and making sugar For at first they had wholly applied themselves to the raising of cacao as the Spaniards had done before them It was happy for them that they fell into this new practice for the cacao groves planted by the Spaniards began to fail and the new plantations did not answer as the negroes foretold they would not because of the want of certain religious ceremonies  always used by the Spaniards in planting them at which none of the slaves were suffered to be present and to the use of which they attributed the prosperity of these plantations Probably there were methods taken at that time that were covered by the veil of these religious ceremonies which are necessary to the wellbeing of that plant However that be the cacao has never since equalled the reputation of the Spanish but gave way to the more profitable cultivation of indigo and sugar  But what gave the greatest life to this new settlement and raised it at once to a surprizing pitch of opulence which it hardly equals even in our days was the resort thither of those pirates called the Buccaneers That people who fought with the most desperate bravery and spent their plunder with the most stupid extravagance were very welcome guests in Jamaica They often brought two three and four hundred thousand pieces of eight at a time which were immediately squandered away in all the ways of excessive gaming wine and women Vast fortunes were made and the returns of treasure to England were prodigiously great In the island they had by this means raised such funds that when the source of this wealth was stopped up by the  suppression of the pirates they were enabled to turn their industry into better channels They increased so fast that it was computed that in the beginning of this century they had sixty thousand whites and a hundred and twenty thousand negroes in this island This calculation is certainly too large However the Jamaicans were undoubtedly very numerous until reduced by earthquakes one of which intirely ruined PortRoyal and killed a vast number of persons in all parts of the country and by very terrible epidemical diseases which treading on the heels of the former calamities swept away vast multitudes Losses which have not been since sufficiently repaired Now the white inhabitants scarcely exceed twenty thousand souls and the blacks are about ninety thousand both much fewer than was computed formerly and with a disproportion much greater on the side of the whites It appears at present that Jamaica is rather upon the decline a point this that deserves the most attentive consideration A country which contains at least four millions of acres has a fertile soil an extensive sea coast and many very fine harbours for an island so circumstanced and at a time when the value of all it's products at market is considerably risen for such a country to fall short of it's  former numbers and not to have above three or four hundred thousand acres employed in any sort of culture shews clearly that something must be very wrong in the management of its affairs and what shews it even yet more clearly land is so extravagantly dear in many of the other islands as to sell sometimes for one hundred pounds an acre and upwards a price that undoubtedly never would be paid if convenient land was to be had and proper encouragement given in Jamaica Whether this be owing to public or private faults I know not but certain it is that wherever they are they deserve a speedy and effectual remedy from those in whose power it is to apply it  CHAP III  THE natural products of Jamaica besides sugar cacao and ginger are principally piemento or as it is called allspice or Jamaica pepper The tree which bears the piemento rises to the height of above thirty feet It is straight of a moderate thickness and covered with a grey bark extremely smooth and shining It shoots out a vast number of branches upon all sides that bear a plentiful foliage of very large and beautiful leaves of a shining green in all things resembling  the leaf of the bay tree At the very end of the twigs are formed bunches of flowers each stalk bearing a flower which bends back and within which bend are to be discerned some stamina of a pale green colour to these succeeds a bunch of small crowned berries larger when ripe than juniper berries at that season they change from their former green and become black smooth and shining they are taken unripe from the tree and dried in the sun in this case they assume a brown colour and have a mixed flavour of many kinds of spice whence it is called allspice But it is milder than the other spices and is judged to be inferior to none of them for the service which it does to cold watery and languid stomachs The tree grows mostly upon the mountains  Besides this they have the wild cinamon tree whose bark is so serviceable in medicine the manchineel a most beautiful tree to the eye with the fairest apple in the world and when cut down affording a very fine ornamental wood for the joiners but the apple and the juice in every part of the tree contain one of the worst poisons in nature Here is the mahogany too in such general use with us the cabbage tree a tall plant famous for a substance looking and tasting like cabbage which grows on the very top and which produces but one a year and for the extreme hardness of it's  wood which when dry is incorruptible and hardly yields to any tool the palma from which is drawn a great deal of oil much esteemed by the negroes both in food and medicine the white wood which never breeds the worm in ships the soap tree whose berries answer all the purposes of washing the mangrove and olive bark useful to tanners the fustic and redwood to the dyers and lately the logwood and their forests supply the apothecary with guaicum salsaparilla china cassia and tamarinds they have aloes too and do not want the cochineal plant though they know nothing of the art of managing it nor perhaps is the climate suitable The indigo plant was formerly much cultivated and the cotton tree is still so and they send home more of it's wool than all the rest of our islands together  The whole product therefore of the island may be reduced to these heads First sugars of which they exported in twenty thousand three hundred and fifteen hogsheads some vastly great even to a tun weight which cannot be worth less in England than pounds sterling Most of this goes to London and Bristol and some part of it to North America in return for the beef pork cheese corn pease staves plank pitch and tar which they have from thence Rum of which they export about puncheons  The rum of this island esteemed the best and is the most generally used in England Molasses in which they make a great part of their returns for New England where there are vast distilleries All these are the produce of their grand staple the sugar cane Cotton of which they send out bags The indigo formerly much cultivated is now inconsiderable but some cacoa and coffee are exported which latter is in no great esteem though it is said to be little inferior to that of Mocha provided it be kept for two or three years With these they send home a considerable quantity of piemento ginger drugs for dyers and apothecaries sweetmeats and mahogany and manchineel plank But some of the most considerable articles of their trade are with the Spanish continent of New Spain and Terra Firma for in the former they cut great quantities of logwood and both in the former and latter they drive a vast and profitable trade in negroes and all kinds of the same European goods which are carried thither from Old Spain by the flota  Both the logwood trade and this counterband have been the subjects of much contention and the cause of a war between our's and the Spanish nation The former we avow and we claim it as our right though in the last treaty of peace that point was far from being well settled The latter we permit  because we think and very justly that if the Spaniards find themselves aggrieved by any counterband trade it lies upon them and not upon us to put a stop to it  Formerly we cut logwood in the bay of Campeachy on the northern side of the peninsula of Jucatan But the Spaniards have driven our people entirely from thence and built forts and made settlements to prevent them from returning Expelled from thence the logwood cutters settled upon the gulph of Honduras on the southern side of the same peninsula where they are in some sort established and have a sort to protect them They are an odd kind of people composed mostly of vagabonds and fugitives from all parts of North America and their way of life is suitable They live pretty much in a lawless manner though they elect one amongst them whom they call their king and to him they pay as much obedience as they think fit The country they are in is low and extremely marshy the air is prodigiously molested with muskettoes and the water dangerous with alligators yet a life of licentiousness a plenty of brandy large gains and a want of thought have perfectly reconciled them to the hardships of their employment and the unwholsomeness of the climate They go always well armed and are about one thousand five hundred men  In the dry season when they cut the logwood they advance a considerable way into the country following the logwood which runs amongst the other trees of the forest like the vein of a mineral in the earth When the rains have overflowed the whole country they have marks by which they know where the logwood is deposited This is an heavy wood and sinks in the water However it is easily buoyed up and one diver can lift very large beams These they carry by the favour of the landfloods into the river to a place which is called the Barcaderas or Port where they meet the ships that come upon this trade  In the year when the debate concerning this matter was revived the lords of trade reported that before the year we had a number of people settled and carrying on this trade on the peninsula of Jucatan that we always considered this as our right and were supported in it by our kings and that this right was confirmed if it had wanted any confirmation by a clause of  uti possidetis  in the treaty of peace which was concluded with Spain and the court of London in and that we certainly were in full possession of those settlements and that trade long before the time of that treaty and further that the Spaniards themselves have incidentally drawn a great advantage from it since the pirates who were formerly the most resolved  and effectual enemies they ever had were the more easily restrained from their enterprises by having their minds diverted to this employment Upon the whole they concluded it an affair very well worth the attention of the government as in some years it employed near six thousand tuns of shipping found employment for a number of seamen proportionable consumed a good deal of our manufactures and was of considerable use in fabricating many others and that the whole value of the returns were not less than sixty thousand pounds sterling a year Notwithstanding this our claim seems dropped nor is it very clear how far it can be maintained to carry on a trade by violence in a country in which we can hardly claim according to the common ideas of right in America any property However this may be the trade though with many difficulties and discouragements still continues and will probably continue whilst the Spaniards are so weak upon that side of Mexico and while the coast continues so disagreeable that none but desperate persons will venture to reside there The logwood trade is generally carried on by New England vessels who take the goods they want in Jamaica  But there is a trade yet more profitable carried on between this island and the Spanish continent especially in time of war This too  has been the cause of much bickering between us and the court of Spain and it will yet be more difficult for them to put a stop to this trade than to the former whilst the Spaniards are so eager for it whilst it is so profitable to the British merchant and whilst the Spanish officers from the highest to the lowest shew so great a respect to presents properly made The trade is carried on in this manner The ship from Jamaica having taken in negroes and a proper sortment of goods there proceeds in time of peace to a harbour called the Grout within Monkeykey about four miles from Portobello A person who understands Spanish is directly sent ashore to give the merchants of the town notice of the arrival of the vessel the same news is carried likewise with great speed to Panama from whence the merchants set out disguised like peasants with their silver in jars covered with meal to deceive the officers of the revenue Here the ship remains trading frequently for five or six weeks together The Spaniards usually come on board leave their money and take their negroes and their goods packed up in parcels fit for one man to carry after having been handsomely entertained on board and receiving provisions sufficient for their journey homeward If the whole cargo is not disposed of here they bear off eastward to the Brew a harbour about five miles distant  from Carthagena where they soon find a vent for the rest There is no trade more profitable than this for your payments are made in ready money and the goods sell higher than they would at any other market It is not on this coast only but every where upon the Spanish main that this trade is carried on nor is it by the English only but the French from Hispaniola the Dutch from Curassou and even the Danes have some share in it When the Spanish guarda costas seize upon one of these vessels they make no scruple of confiscating the cargo and of treating the crew in a manner little better than pirates  This commerce in time of peace and this with the prizes that are made in time of war pour into Jamaica an astonishing quantity of treasure great fortunes are made in a manner instantly whilst the people appear to live in such a state of luxury as in all other places leads to beggary Their equipages their cloaths their furniture their tables all bear the tokens of the greatest wealth and profusion imaginable this obliges all the treasure they receive to make but a very short stay as all this treasure added to all the products of the island itself is hardly more than sufficient to answer the calls of their necessity and luxury on Europe and North America and their demand for slaves of which this island is under the necessity of an annual recruit for it's own use and  that of the Spanish trade of upwards of six thousand head and which stand them one with another in thirty pounds apiece and often more  CHAP IV  THE whole island is divided into nineteen districts or parishes which send each of them two members to the assembly and allow a competent maintenance to a minister PortRoyal was anciently the capital of the island it stood upon the very point of a long narrow neck of land which towards the sea formed part of the border of a very noble harbour of it's own name In this harbour above a thousand sail of the largest ships could anchor with the greatest convenience and safety and the water was so deep at the key of PortRoyal that vessels of the greatest burthen could lay their broadsides to the wharfs and load and unload at little expence or trouble This conveniency weighed so much with the inhabitants that they chose in this spot to build their capital though the place was an hot dry sand which produced not one of the necessaries of life no not even fresh water However this advantageous situation and the resort of the pirates soon made it a very considerable place It contained two thousand houses very handsomely built and  which rented as high as those in London It had a resort like a constant fair by the great concourse of people of business and grew to all this in about thirty years time for before that there was scarcely an house upon the place In short there were very few parts of the world which for the size could be compared to this town for trade wealth and an entire corruption of manners  It continued thus until the th of June when an earthquake which shook the whole island to it's foundations overwhelmed this city and buried nine tenths of it eight fathom under water This earthquake not only demolished this city but made a terrible devastation all over the island and was followed by a contagious distemper which was near giving the last hand to it's ruin Ever since it is remarked that the air is far more unwholsome than formerly This earthquake one of the most dreadful that I think ever was known is described in such lively colours in the Philosophical transactions and by persons who saw and had a large part in the terrors and losses of this calamity that I shall say nothing of it but refer thither as I am certain no man from his fancy could assemble a greater number of images of horror than the nature of things taught the persons who saw them to bring together and which are there related very naturally and pathetically  They rebuilt this city after the earthquake but it was again destroyed A terrible fire laid it in ashes about ten years after Notwithstanding this the extraordinary convenience of the harbour tempted them to rebuild it again But in the year a hurricane one of the most terrible on record reduced it a third time to a heap of rubbish Warned by these extraordinary calamities that seemed to mark out this place as a devoted spot an act of assembly removed the customhouse and publick offices from thence and forbid that any market should be held there for the future The principal inhabitants came to reside at the opposite side of the bay at a place which is called Kingston This town is commodiously situated for fresh water and all manner of accommodations The streets are of a commodious wideness regularly drawn and cutting each other at equal distances and right angles It consists of upwards of one thousand houses many of them handsomely built though low with porticoes and every conveniency for a comfortable habitation in that climate The harbour was formerly in no good posture of defence but by the care of the late governor Mr Knowles it is now strongly fortified  The river Cobre a considerable but not navigable stream falls into the sea not far from Kingston Upon the banks of this river stands  St Jago de la Vega or Spanishtown the seat of government and the place where the courts of justice are held and consequently the capital of Jamaica though inferior in size and resort to Kingston However this tho' a town of less business has more gaiety Here reside many persons of large fortunes and who make a figure proportionable the number of coaches kept here is very great here is a regular assembly and the residence of the governor and the principal officers of the government who have all very profitable places conspire with the genius of the inhabitants ostentatious and expensive to make it a very splendid and agreeable place Mr Knowles the late governor made an attempt to remove the seat of government from hence to Kingston for reasons which it must be owned have a very plausible appearance for it would certainly facilitate the carrying on of business to have the courts of justice and the seat of government as near as possible to the center of commercial affairs But whether the consideration of a more healthful situation the division of the advantages of great towns with the several parts of the country and the mischiefs that might arise from shaking the settled order of things and prejudicing the property of a great many private people can weigh against the advantages proposed by this removal I will not undertake to determine  One thing appears I think very plainly in the contest which this regulation produced that the opposition was at least as much to the governor as to the measure and that great natural warmth of temper upon all sides enflamed and envenomed by a spirit of party which reigns in all our plantations kindled a flame about this which if it had not happened must have risen to the same height upon some other occasion since there was a plenty of combustible materials ready upon all sides  The government of this island is next to that of Ireland the best in the king's gift The standing salary is two thousand five hundred pounds a year The assembly vote the governor as much more and this with the other great profits of his office make it in the whole little inferior to ten thousand pounds a year But of the government I shall say little until I speak of the government of the rest of the plantations to which this is in all respects alike  CHAP V  THE next island in point of importance which we possess in the WestIndies but the oldest in point of settlement is Barbadoes This is one and by no means the most contemptible one amongst the Windward division of the Caribbee islands It is not distinctly known when this island was first discovered or settled but it was probably some time about the year  When the English first landed here they found the place the most savage and destitute that can be well imagined It had not the least appearance of ever having been peopled even by savages There was no kind of beast of pasture or of prey no fruit nor herb nor root fit for supporting the life of man Yet as the climate was good and the soil appeared fertile some gentlemen of small fortunes in England resolved to become adventurers thither But the first planters had not only the utter desolateness of the place and the extreme want of provisions to struggle with but the trees were so large of a wood so hard and stubborn and full of such great branches that they proceeded in the clearing of the ground with a difficulty that must have worn down  any ordinary patience And even when they had tolerably cleared some little spot the first produce it yielded for their subsistence was so small and ordinary at the same time that their supplies from England were so slow and precarious that nothing but the noblest courage and a firmness which cannot receive too many praises could have carried them through the discouragements which they met in the noblest work in the world the cultivating and peopling a deserted part of the globe But by degrees things were mollified some of the trees yielded fustic for the dyers cotton and indigo agreed well with the soil tobacco then becoming fashionable in England answered tolerably and the country began gradually to lay aside all it's savage disposition and to submit to culture  These good appearances in America and the storm which some time after began to gather in England encouraged many to go over but still the colony received no sort of encouragement from the government which at that time understood the advantages of colonies but little and which was besides much worse occupied in sowing those seeds of bitterness which came afterwards so terribly to their own lips The court took no other notice of this island than to grant it to a very unworthy and unfaithful favourite the earl of Carlisle  which as may be judged proved of no advantage to the settlement  However as this colony had the hardiest breeding and the most laborious infancy of any of our settlements so it was far stronger in it's stamina and grew with greater speed and that to an height which if it were not proved beyond any reasonable doubt could scarcely be believed For in this small island which is but twentyfive miles in length and in breadth but fourteen in little more than twenty years after it's first settlement that is in it contained upwards of fifty thousand whites of all sexes and ages and a much greater number of blacks and Indian slaves The former of which slaves they bought the latter they acquired by means not at all to their honour for they seized upon those unhappy men without any pretence in the neighbouring islands and carried them into slavery A practice which has rendered the Caribbee Indians irreconcileable to us ever since  This small island peopled by upwards of one hundred thousand souls was not yet above half of it cultivated nor was the industry of the inhabitants at a stand A little before the period I have mentioned they learned the method of making sugar and this enlarging the sphere of their trade they grew prodigiously rich and numerous  About this time the government in England which was then in the hands of Cromwell confined the trade of Barbadoes to the mother country that before was managed altogether by the Dutch at the same time that by the rigour which was exercised towards the royal party a great many gentlemen of very good families settled in this island which was far from being peopled like some other colonies by fugitives and men desperate at home After the restoration it continued still to advance by very hasty strides At that time king Charles created thirteen baronets from the gentlemen of this island some of whom were worth ten thousand pounds a year and none so little as one thousand  In which was the meridian of this settlement their whites were computed to be still much about fifty thousand but their negroe slaves were increased so as to be upwards of one hundred thousand of all kinds They employed four hundred sail of ships one with another of an hundred and fifty tuns in their trade and their annual exported produce in sugar indigo ginger cotton c amounted to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds and their circulating cash at home was two hundred thousand pounds It is probable that Holland itself or perhaps even the best inhabited parts of China were never peopled to the same proportion nor have they land of the same dimensions which produces  any thing like the same profits excepting the land upon which great cities are built But since that time the island has been much upon the decline The growth of the French sugar islands and the settlement of Antegua St Christopher's Nevis and Montserrat as well as the greater establishment in Jamaica have drawn away from time to time a vast number of their people A terrible contagion said to be brought over by the troops from England but more probably derived from the coast of Africa attacked the island in the year it raged like a pestilence twenty have died in a day in their principal town and all parts of the island suffered in proportion This sickness continued with some abatements for several years and left an ill disposition in the climate ever afterwards War raged at the same time with this distemper and the Barbadians who raised a good number of men lost many of them in fruitless expeditions against the French islands The land too began not to yield quite so kindly as it formerly had done and in some places they were obliged to manure it All these causes contributed to reduce the numbers and opulence of this celebrated island But it is only in comparison of itself that it may be considered in any other than the most flourishing condition even at this day for at this day it contains twentyfive thousand whites very near  eighty thousand negroes and it ships above twentyfive thousand hogsheads of sugar to the value of three hundred thousand pounds besides rum molasses cotton ginger and aloes an immense peopling and produce for a country not containing more than one hundred acres thousand of land so that by the rise of sugars the returns of this island are little less than they were in it's most flourishing times  This island can raise near five thousand men of it's own militia and it has generally a regiment of regular troops though not very compleat It is fortified by nature all along the windward shore by the rocks and shoals so as to be near two thirds utterly inaccessible On the leeward side it has good harbours but the whole coast is protected by a good line of several miles in length and several forts to defend it at the most material places  They support their own establishment which is very considerable with great credit The governor's place is worth at least five thousand pounds a year and the rest of their officers have very valuable places They provide very handsomely for their clergy who are of the church of England which is the religion established here as it is in the other islands But here are very few dissenters There is in general an appearance of something more of order and decency and of a settled people than in any other colony in the WestIndies  They have here a college founded and well endowed by the virtue and liberality of that great man colonel Christopher Codrington who was a native of this island and who for a great number of amiable and useful qualities both in public and private life for his courage and his zeal for the good of his country his humanity his knowledge and love of literature was far the richest production and most shining ornament this island ever had  This college does not so fully answer the intentions of the excellent founder as it might do If the fund was applied to the education of a number of catechists for the instruction of the negroes some of them of their own colour it would be a vast public advantage besides the charity or perhaps the indispensible duty of some such work  This college is in Bridgetown the capital of the island which before the late fire contained about twelve hundred houses very handsomely built and inhabited by a numerous and wealthy people The country of Barbadoes has a most beautiful appearance swelling here and there into gentle hills shinning by the cultivation of every part by the verdure of the sugar canes the bloom and fragrance of the number of orange lemon lime and citron trees the guavas papas aloes and a vast multitude of other elegant and useful  plants which rise intermix'd with the houses of the planters which are sown thickly on every part of the island Even the negroe huts though mean contribute to the beauty of the country for they shade them with plantain trees which give their villages the appearance of so many beautiful groves In short there is no place in the WestIndies comparable to Barbadoes in point of numbers of people cultivation of the soil and those elegancies and conveniencies which result from both  CHAP VI  THE island of St Christopher's is the chief of those which we possess amongst the Leeward islands It was first settled by the French and English in the year but after various fortunes it was entirely ceded to us by the treaty of Utrecht This island is about seventyfive miles in compass The circuit of Antegua is but little inferior Nevis and Montserrat are the smallest of the four not exceeding for either of them about eighteen or twenty miles in circumference The soil in all these islands is pretty much alike light and sandy but notwithstanding fertile in an high degree Antegua has no rivulets  of fresh water and but very few springs this made it be deemed uninhabitable for a long time but now they save the rains in ponds and cisterns with great care and they are rarely in great distress for water The island of St Christopher's makes the best and most sugars of any but neither that nor any of the Leeward islands yields any other commodity of consequence but what is derived from the cane except Montserrat which exports some indigo but of a very inferior kind It is judged that the island of St Christopher's contains about nine thousand whites and twentyfive thousand negroes that Antegua has about seven thousand of the former colour and twenty thousand blacks and that Nevis and Montserrat may have each about five thousand Europeans who are the masters of ten or twelve thousand African slaves So that the whole of the Leeward islands may be reckoned without exaggeration to maintain about twentysix thousand English of whom every single man gives bread to several in England which is effected by the labour of near seventy thousand negroes Their sugar is proportionable certainly not less than twentyfive thousand hogsheads annually Of the island of Barbuda I say little because it has no direct trade with England It is employed in husbandry and raising fresh provisions for the use of the neighbouring colonies It is the property of the Codrington family  These islands are under the management of one governor who has the title of captain general and governor in chief of all the Caribbee islands from Guardaloupe to Porto Rico His post is worth about three thousand five hundred pounds a year Under him each island has it's particular deputy governor at a salary of two hundred pounds a year and it's separate independent legislative of a council and an assembly of the representatives  CHAP VII  THE climate in all our WestIndia islands is nearly the same allowing for those accidental differences which the several situations and qualities of the lands themselves produce As they lie within the tropic and that the sun goes quite over their heads and passes beyond them to the North and never retires further from any of them than about degrees to the South they are continually subjected to the extreme of an heat which would be intolerable if the trade wind rising gradually as the sun gathers strength did not blow in upon them from the sea and refresh the air in such a manner as to enable them to attend their concerns even under the meridian sun On the other hand as the night advances a breeze begins to be perceived which blows smartly from the land as if it were  from it's center towards the sea to all points of the compass at once  By the same remarkable providence in the disposing of things it is that when the sun has made a great progress towards the tropic of Cancer and becomes in a manner vertical he draws after him such a vast body of clouds as shield them from his direct beams and dissolving into rain cool the air and refresh the country thirsty with the long drought which commonly reigns from the beginning of January to the latter end of May  The rains in the WestIndies are by no means the things they are with us Our heaviest rains are but dews comparatively They are rather floods of water poured from the clouds with a prodigious impetuosity the rivers rise in a moment new rivers and lakes are formed and in a short time all the low country is under water Hence it is that the rivers which have their sources within the tropics swell and overflow their banks at a certain season and so mistaken were the ancients in their idea of the torrid zone which they imagined to be dried and scorched up with a continual and fervent heat and for that reason uninhabitable when in reality some of the largest rivers in the world have their course within it's limits and the moisture is one of the greatest inconveniences of the climate in several places  The rains make the only distinction of seasons in the WestIndies the trees are green the whole year round they have no cold no frosts no snows and but rarely some hail the storms of which are however very violent when they happen and the hailstones very great and heavy Whether it be owing to this moisture alone which alone does not seem to be a sufficient cause or to a greater quantity of a sulphurous acid which predominates in the air in this country metals of all kinds that are subject to the action of such causes rust and canker in a very short time and this cause perhaps as much as the heat itself contributes to make the climate of the WestIndies unfriendly and unpleasant to an European constitution  It is in the rainy season principally in the month of August more rarely in July and September that they are assaulted by hurricanes the most terrible calamity to which they are subject from the climate this destroys at a stroke the labours of many years and prostrates the most exalted hopes of the planter and often just at the moment when he thinks himself out of the reach of fortune It is a sudden and violent storm of wind rain thunder and lightning attended with a furious swelling of the seas and sometimes with an earthquake in short with every circumstance which the elements can assemble that is terrible  and destructive First they see as the prelude to the ensuing havock whole fields of sugar canes whirled into the air and scattered over the face of the country The strongest trees of the forest are torn up by the roots and driven about like stubble their windmills are swept away in a moment their works the fixtures the ponderous copper boilers and stills of several hundred weight are wrenched from the ground and battered to pieces their houses are no protection the roofs are torn off at one blast whilst the rain which in an hour rises five feet rushes in upon them with an irresistible violence  There are signs which the Indians of these islands taught our planters by which they can prognosticate the approach of an hurricane The hurricane comes on either in the quarters or at the full change of the moon If it comes at the full moon when you are at the change observe these signs That day you will see the sky very turbulent you will observe the sun more red than at other times you will perceive a dead calm and the hills clear of all those clouds and mists which usually hover about them In the clefts of the earth and in the wells you hear a hollow rumbling sound like the rushing of a great wind At night the stars seem much larger than usual and surrounded with a sort of burs the NorthWest sky has a black and  menacing look the sea emits a strong smell and rises into vast waves often without any wind the wind itself now forsakes it's usual steady Easterly stream and shifts about to the West from whence it sometimes blows with intermissions violently and irregularly for about two hours at a time You have the same signs at the full of the moon the moon herself is surrounded with a great bur and sometimes the sun has the same appearance These prognostics were taught by the Indians and in general one may observe that ignorant country people and barbarous nations are better observers of times and seasons and draw better rules from them than more civilized and reasoning people for they rely more upon experience than theories they are more careful of traditionary observations and living more in the open air at all times and not so occupied but they have leisure to observe every change though minute in that element they come to have great treasures of useful matter though as it might be expected mixed with many superstitious and idle notions as to the causes These make their observations to be rejected as chimerical in the gross by many literati who are not near so nice and circumspect as they ought to be in distinguishing what this sort of people may be very competent judges of and what not  The grand staple commodity of the WestIndies is sugar this commodity was not at all known to the Greeks and Romans though it was made in China in very early times from whence we had the first knowledge of it but the Portuguese were the first who cultivated it in America and brought it into request as one of the materials of a very universal luxury in Europe It is not settled whether the cane from which this substance is extracted be a native of America or brought thither by the Portuguese from India and the coast of Africa but however the matter may be in the beginning they made the most as they still do the best sugars which come to market in this part of the world The sugar cane grows to the height of between six and eight feet full of joints about four or five inches asunder the colour of the body of the cane is yellowish and the top where it shoots into leaves of a vivid green the coat is pretty hard and within contains a spungy substance full of a juice the most lively elegant and least cloying sweet in nature and which sucked raw has proved extremely nutritive and wholsome  They are cultivated in this manner In the month of August that is in the rainy part of the year after the ground is cleared and well hoed they lay a piece of six or seven joints of the cane flat in a channel made for it above half a foot deep this they cover with the  earth and so plant the whole field in lines regularly disposed and at proper distances In a short time a young cane shoots out from every joint of the stock which was interred and grows in ten or twelve days to be a pretty tall and vigorous plant but it is not until after sixteen months or thereabouts that the canes are fit to answer the purposes of the planter though they may remain a few months after without any considerable prejudice to him The longer they remain in the the ground after they are come to maturity the less juice they afford but this is somewhat compensated by the superior richness of the juice That no time may be lost they generally divide their cane grounds into three parts One is of standing canes and to be cut that season the second is of new planted canes and the third is fallow ready to receive a fresh supply In some places they make second and third cuttings from the same root The tops of the canes and the leaves which grow upon the joints make very good provender for their cattle and the refuse of the cane after grinding serves for fire so that no part of this excellent plant is without it's use  The canes are cut with a billet and carried in bundles to the mill which is now generally a windmill it turns three great cylinders or rollers plated with iron set perpendicularly  and cogged so as to be all moved by the middle roller Between these the canes are bruised to pieces and the juice runs through an hole into a vat which is placed under the rollers to receive it from hence it is carried through a pipe into a great reservoir in which however for fear of turning sour it is not suffered to rest long but is conveyed out of that by other pipes into the boiling house where it is received by a large cauldron here it remains until the scum which constantly arises during the boiling is all taken off from this it is passed successively into five or six more boilers gradually diminishing in their size and treated in the same manner In the last of these it becomes of a very thick clammy consistence but mere boiling is incapable of carrying it farther to advance the operation they pour in a small quantity of limewater the immediate effect of this alien mixture is to raise up the liquor in a very vehement fermentation but to prevent it from running over a bit of butter no larger than a nut is thrown in upon which the fury of the fermentation immediately subsides a vessel of two or three hundred gallons requires no greater force to quiet it It is now taken out and placed in a cooler where it dries granulates and becomes fit to be put into the pots which is the last part of the operation  The pots are conical or of a sugarloaf fashion open at the point which must be considered as their bottom here a strainer is put across In these pots the sugar purges itself of it's remaining impurity the molasses or treacly part disentangles itself from the rest precipitates and runs out of the aperture at the bottom it is now in the condition called muscavado sugar of a yellowish brown colour and thus it is generally put into the hogshead and shipped off  But when they have a mind to refine it yet further and leave no remains at all of the molasses they cover the pots I have just mentioned with a sort of white clay like that used for tobacco pipes diluted with water this penetrates the sugar unites with the molasses and with them runs off leaving the sugar of a whitish colour but whitest at top This is called clayed sugar the operation is sometimes repeated once or twice more and the sugar every time diminishing in quantity gains considerably in value but still is called clayed sugar Further than this they do not go in the plantations because an heavy duty of sixteen shillings per hundred weight is laid upon all sugars refined there it is therefore not to my purpose to carry the account any further  Of the molasses rum is made in a manne  that needs no description since it differs in  nothing from the manner of distilling any other spirit From the scummings of the sugar a meaner spirit is procured Rum finds its market in North America where it is consumed by the English inhabitants or employed in the Indian trade or distributed from thence to the fishery of Newfoundland and the African commerce besides what comes to England and Ireland However a very great quantity of molasses is taken off raw and carried to New England to be distilled there  They compute that when things are well managed the rum and molasses pay the charges of the plantation and that the sugars are clear gain However by the particulars we have seen and by others which we may easily imagine the expences of a plantation in the WestIndies are very great and the profits at the first view precarious for the chargeable articles of the windmills the boiling cooling and distilling houses and the buying and subsisting a suitable number of slaves and cattle will not suffer any man to begin a sugar plantation of any consequence not to mention the purchase of the land which is very high under a capital of at least five thousand pounds Neither is the life of a planter a life of idleness and luxury at all times he must keep a watchful eye upon his overseers and even oversee himself occasionally But at the boiling season if he is properly attentive to his  affairs no way of life can be more laborious and more dangerous to the health from a constant attendance day and night in the extreme united heats of the climate and so many fierce furnaces add to this the losses by hurricanes earthquakes and bad seasons and then consider when the sugars are in the cask that he quits the hazard of a planter to engage in the hazards of a merchant and ships his produce at his own risk The sum of all might make one believe that it could never answer to engage in this business but notwithstanding all this there are no parts of the world in which great estates are made in so short a time as in the WestIndies The produce of a few good seasons will provide against the ill effects of the worst as the planter is sure of a speedy and profitable market for his produce which has a readier sale than perhaps any other commodity in the world  Large plantations are generally under the care of a manager or chief overseer who has commonly a salary of a hundred and fifty pounds a year with overseers under him in proportion to the greatness of the plantation one to about thirty negroes and at the rate of about forty pounds Such plantations too have a surgeon at a fixed salary employed to take care of the negroes which belong to it But the course which is the least troublesome to the  owner of the estate is to let the land with all the works and the stock of cattle and slaves to a tenant who gives security for the payment of the rent and the keeping up repairs and the stock The estate is generally estimated to such a tenant at half the neat produce of the best years Such tenants if industrious and frugal men soon make good estates for themselves  The negroes in the plantations are subsisted at a very easy rate This is generally by allotting to each family of them a small portion of land and allowing them two days in the week Saturday and Sunday to cultivate it some are subsisted in this manner but others find their negroes themselves with a certain portion of Guinea or Indian corn and to some a salt herring or a small quantity of bacon or salt pork a day All the rest of the charge consists in a cap a shirt a pair of breeches stockings and shoes the whole not exceeding forty shillings a year  To particularise the commodities proper for the WestIndia market would be to enumerate all the necessaries conveniencies and luxuries of life for they have nothing of their own but the commodities I have already mentioned Traders there make a very large profit upon all they sell and all kind of handicraftsmen especially carpenters bricklayers and brasiers get very great encouragement  CHAP VIII  THE disposition to industry has a variety of characters and is by no means constantly of the same colour Some acquiesce in a moderate labour through the whole of their lives attended with no risk either to their persons or their gains such sort of people who form the best citizens in general are fit to stay at home Others full as remote from an indolent disposition are of quite a different character These are fiery restless tempers willing to undertake the severest labour provided it promises but a short continuance who love risk and hazard whose schemes are always vast and who put no medium between being great and being undone Characters of this sort especially when they happen in low and middling life are often dangerous members in a regular and settled community But the WestIndies opens a fair and ample field to encourage persons of such a disposition and it may be reckoned one very great benefit of our possessions in that part of the world that besides the vast quantities of our fabrics which they consume our seamen that they employ and our revenues that they support that they are a vent to carry off such spirits whom they keep occupied greatly to the public benefit Our dominions  are to circumstanced and afford such a variety that all dispositions to business of what kind soever may have exercise without pressing upon one another It is besides a great happiness that unfortunate men whom unavoidable accident the frowns of the world or the cruelty of creditors would have rendered miserable to themselves and useless to the public may find a sort of asylum where at last they often succeed so well as to have reason to bless those accidents which drove them from their country poor deserted and despised to return them to it in opulence and credit Of such a change every one can produce many instances of his own knowledge as whoever looks about him cannot fail to see a great number of persons who having taken wrong steps in the beginning of their lives have established such a character of weakness and imprudence as prevents them ever after from being trusted or employed wherever they are at all known although their characters should be altogether chang'd and the passions quite subsided which gave occasion to their errors Such persons become first indigent then desperate and at last abandoned but when they have an opportunity of going where this prejudice does not operate against them they set up as new men With the advantage of an experience acquired by their mistakes  they are free from the ill reputation which attended them and they prove of vast service to their country to which they could be of no advantage whilst they remained in it There are persons too far more blameable than either of the former sorts who having erred without proper caution in points of morality are deservedly regarded with distrust and abhorrence though they may be at bottom far from being utterly abandoned and are still excepting their character the stuff proper for making very good men of the world  These are the several sorts of people who with very few exceptions have settled the WestIndies and North America in a good measure And thus have we drawn from the rashness of hot and visionary men the imprudence of youth the corruption of bad morals and even from the wretchedness and misery of persons destitute and undone the great source of our wealth our strength and our power And though this was neither the effect of our wisdom nor the consequence of our foresight yet having happened it may tend to give us more wisdom and a better foresight for it will undoubtedly be a standing monitor to us how much we ought to cherish the colonies we have already established by every encouragement in our power and by every reasonable indulgence and it will be an additional spur to make us active  in the acquisition of new ones Since experience has taught us that as there is no soil or climate which will not shew itself grateful to culture so that there is no disposition no character in mankind which may not be turned with dextrous management to the public advantage These rulers who make complaints of the temper of their people in almost any respect ought rather to lament their own want of genius which blinds them to the use of an instrument purposely put into their hands by providence for effecting perhaps the greatest things There are humours in the body which contained may be noxious to it yet which sent abroad are the proper materials for generating new bodies Providence and a great minister who should imitate providence often gain their ends by means that seem most contrary to them for earthquakes and hurricanes and floods are as necessary to the wellbeing of things as calms and sunshine life and beauty are drawn from death and corruption and the most efficacious medicines are often found united with the most deadly poisons This as it is well known is the order of nature and perhaps it might not unwisely be considered as an example for government  CHAP IX  THOUGH we have drawn such great advantages from our possessions in the WestIndies and are even in our present way of acting likely to continue to draw still more and though we have not wholly neglected the culture of that useful province yet some will think that there are some things yet left undone some things in which our neighbours have set us a laudable example and some others which the inconveniencies we have felt from the want of them demonstrate to be necessary to ourselves But it is not my purpose to handle this subject in its full extent since it is the wisdom and power of the legislature and not the unauthorized speculations of a private man which can effect any thing useful in this way A WestIndian who is naturally warm in his temper and not too servilely obedient to the rules of the bienseance might find some faults in our proceedings here and would perhaps reason in a manner not unlike the following  "One would think from some instances that at the distance we are placed from the seat of authority we were too remote to enjoy it's protection but not to feel it's weight Innumerable are the grievances which have oppressed us from our infancy and which  contribute to bring on us a premature old age Not one of the least evils under which our plantations in the WestIndies groan is the support of an expensive civil establishment suited rather to an established and independent country in the plenitude of wealth and power then to newly settled colonies to which nobody thinks himself to belong as to his country and which struggle with a total want of almost all the necessaries and conveniencies of life The building and maintaining the public works and fortifications is a weight to which we are totally unequal and the laying of which upon our shoulders is directly contrary to the very purpose for which you cultivate the colonies for though the produce of these colonies is in general to be considered as a luxury yet is it of the greatest value to you first as it supplies you with things which if not from us you must certainly take from foreign nations Even in this view the colonies are extremely useful But there is another and a much more advantageous light in which you may view them you may consider them as they supply you with a commodity which you export to other countries and which helps to bring the ballance of trade in your favour  The whole secret of managing a foreign market is contained in two words to have the commodity of a good kind and to sell it  cheap and the whole domestic policy of trade consists in contriving to answer these two ends and principally the latter Now by what magic can we effect to sell as cheap as the French at any foreign market when our planters pay four and a half per cent duty upon all the sugars which they ship off in America and this after having had the same commodity in effect heavily taxed before by the poll on the negroes which work it and by other impositions which the planters endure according to the exigencies of the government when the French planter pays a very insignificant polltax at worst and not one per cent duty upon all the sugars he exports when he buys his negroes at an easier rate than we can do when he  is more favoured upon every occasion and is besides of a temper more industrious and frugal than is found in our people Besides this upon sudden emergencies we run very much in debt the island of Barbadoes at one stroke expended thirty thousand pounds upon a fortification to say nothing of what this and what other islands have done in the same way and upon similar occasions We are in reality only your factors you in England ought to consider yourselves as the merchants who should be at the whole expence and should willingly abide by whatsoever loss accrues since the profits are all your own and since in  the end by the course of trade the loss too let you take what shifting measures you please to avoid it and to cheat yourselves with appearances It is reasonable that you should lay what duty you please upon what is consumed amongst yourselves because you govern that market as you please but what you charge or suffer to be charged on the islands is only the price of your own goods enhanced so much at the foreign market there you have no exclusive privilege and there you are sure to suffer If that duty which is laid in England upon the produce of our islands or even half of it were expended as in reason it ought for the support of our establishment we might well be freed from the heavy burthens which we bear and consequently might be somewhat upon a par with our neighbours In our present condition we not only pay very ample salaries to our governors but they are besides suffered to make the most they can by management of our weakness to cheat us into voluntary gratuities which we have given often without a due consideration of our circumstances This custom prompts our governors to use a thousand arts equally unbecoming their character and prejudicial to the provinces they govern It is this which induces them to foment those divisions which tear us to pieces and which prevent us from  attending seriously and entirely to what will best advance the prosperity of our settlements  It were a tedious and disagreeable task to run through all the mischiefs of which that one error of sending a governor to make the most he can of us is the fruitful source The governor I allow ought to have every where a certain reasonable and even a genteel salary but then when he has this he ought not to be in a condition to hope for any thing further and ought to consider nothing but how he may best perform the duty of his office  But I hear it objected that we are already extremely chargeable to England who sends her troops to protect us and her fleets to cover our trade at a very great expence for which we ought to be contented and even thankful and that it is unreasonable to expect she should bear every part of our burthen loaded as she is with the weight of a vast national debt and a most expensive establishment of her own But to this my answer is short plain and practical The French do all this They send armies and fleets to protect their colonies as well as you but they support the establishment in their own plantations notwithstanding and they are far from supposing this an insupportable burthen They  know that a little judicious expence is often the best oeconomy in the world and that in this case it is only sparing their own subjects in the WestIndies and levying the money laid out for their use upon the foreign consumer What they do I see no impossibility of our doing They learned many of their maxims of trade as well as many of the fabrics which supply it from us I wish we would learn from them in our turn We have indeed some years ago eased the trade by permitting ships from the islands to carry our produce out directly to foreign markets but still it is so clogged that we do not feel all the benefit which we might expect from a more general and better regulated liberty Not to carry our enquiries further see what you have gained by prohibiting us to land our sugars directly in Ireland before they are first entered in an English port What was the consequence why your sugars grew dear by this loading and unloading and passing backward and forward The Portuguese offered sugars of at least equal goodness and at a much more moderate price The merchants in Ireland would not refuse so good an offer out of a compliment to you who in this instance paid them no compliment at all and you cannot for very good reasons dispute with the Portuguese about it If this has happened at home the consequence must be infinitely worse abroad  But it is said that our failures abroad are only owing to this that we have not ground enough conveniently situated to produce more sugar than satisfies the home demand But this is far enough from the case There is in several of the islands but there is in Jamaica in particular a great quantity of good land and well enough situated too if means were taken to bring it into culture and a choice of markets to animate the planter in the cultivation who certainly deserves every sort of encouragement as he asks for nothing but to be put into such a condition as may enable him to be of more service to his mother country"  CHAP X  IN the foregoing manner the WestIndian would state some part of what he conceives to be his grievances and those I believe he would be earnest enough to have remedied But there are other regulations which a person not concerned in their affairs might think very proper too but which the WestIndian would enter into with a much greater degree of phlegm  There are now allowed to be in our WestIndies at least two hundred and thirty thousand negroe slaves and it is allowed too that upon the highest calculation the whites there in all  do not amount to ninety thousand souls This disproportion shews so clearly at the first glance how much the colonies are endangered both from within and without how much exposed to the assaults of a foreign enemy and to the insurrection of their own slaves which latter circumstance in all our islands keeps the people in perpetual apprehensions that it may be a just cause of surprise that no measures whatsoever are taken to correct this dangerous irregularity  This disproportion between the freemen and negroes grows more visible every day That enterprising spirit which the novelty of the object and various concurrent causes had produced in the last century has decayed very much We have as many men indigent and unemployed at home as we had then but they have not the same spirit and activity they had at that time The disposition of the people in the WestIndies concurs with that of our people at home to increase and to perpetuate the evil of which I complain for they chuse to do every thing by negroes which can possibly be done by them and though they have laws and ordinances to oblige them to keep a certain number of white servants in some proportion to their blacks in most places these laws are but a dead letter They find it more easy to pay the penalty when seldom it is exacted than  to comply with the law Their avarice in the particulars makes them blind to the hazards to which they expose the sum total of their affairs This disposition in the planters is now almost grown inveterate and to such a degree that the remedy will probably never be administred by themselves and if this disposition continues in a little time which is indeed nearly the case already all the English in our colonies there will consist of little more than a few planters and merchants and the rest will be a despicable though a dangerous because a numerous and disaffected herd of African slaves  Indubitably the security as well as the solid wealth of every nation consists principally in the number of low and middling men of a free condition and that beautiful gradation from the highest to the lowest where the transitions all the way are almost imperceptible To produce this ought to be the aim and mark of every well regulated commonwealth and none has ever flourished upon other principles But when we consider the colony out of that independent light and as it is related to Great Britain it is clear that this neglect is of great detriment to the mother country because it is certain that the consumption of our commodities there would be in a great measure in proportion to the number of white men and there is nobody at  all acquainted with the plantations who will not readily allow that when I say one white man takes off as much of our manufactures as three negroes that I estimate his value to us at a very low rate  But the necessity of having there a proper number of whites is not only strongly enforced by the consideration of the great gain which would from thence accrue to us but from the vast savings which such an arrangement would produce The militia of the WestIndies is exceedingly well trained so as to be in discipline not very much inferior but in courage and spirit beyond most regular troops and they really want nothing but sufficient numbers to be able fully to defend themselves and occasionally to annoy the enemy for both which purposes they are infinitely more fit by being habituated to the climate than raw troops which in this part of the world can never meet the enemy in the field with much more than half their complement A less number of troops would do there in all times if this point was well studied and I may venture to say that the transporting and comfortably providing for a proper number of men effectually to secure our colonies and even to make any attempt upon them desperate would not have cost the government one third part of the money which for these twenty years past has been expended in the transporting and  maintaining of troops there who die and waste away without any benefit to themselves or their country whereas these settlers who would so effectually intimidate a foreign enemy and take away all hope of liberty from the negroes would all the while be enriching their mother country and paying a large interest for the sums she expended in their establishment  I am conscious that many objections will be made against the very proposal and that many more would be started against any effectual scheme for increasing the number of white servants in the WestIndies They are represented as of very little use disorderly idle drunken and fitter to pervert the negroes than to be any assistance to them in their business This I believe to be in general true but this is no sort of objection to having them though it is an excellent argument for putting them their masters and the whole colony under a better regulation If we labour under great inconveniencies from the want of a police at home this want is infinitely more visible in the WestIndies where for the most part they all live without the least sense of religion in a state of vice and debauchery which is really deplorable to consider them as men and christians and of a very bad aspect in a political light If therefore it should be thought convenient by the wisdom of our government at any time to enter into a scheme  for peopling these countries fully and properly it will be equally convenient at the same time to take such strict measures as may preserve them from vice and idleness a thing far enough from impracticable Whenever such regulations shall take place they will in a good measure answer another end too the preserving the health and lives of the people a point which in all places every wise government will have very much at heart but which is above all necessary in a colony where the people are an inestimable treasure and where the climate itself is sufficiently fatal  These observations principally regard Jamaica the largest and best of our islands where there are prodigious tracts of uncultivated land As the rivers there are not navigable and as sugar is a bulky commodity which cannot afford to pay for a very long land carriage the coasts or only the land very near the coasts can be turned to that commodity But if poor people were sufficiently encouraged to settle in the inland parts necessity would oblige them to raise cotton cacao coffee ginger aloes allspice the dying woods and other things which require no vast labour are not so burthensome in carriage and which have all a sufficient demand at home to encourage people who do not look to great and sudden fortunes And as we bring all these especially the cotton which is of great use in  our manufactures from abroad we might encourage the raising more of it by some moderate premium The same necessity too would oblige them to try experiments on cochineal and various other things which we don't now think of and which the climate would not refuse By degrees and with good management they would improve in the culture of many of these articles in which they are now defective the careful would grow tolerably rich and considerable works of many valuable commodities as cocoa cochineal and even indigo may be attempted with small capitals Excepting the labour I don't know that any of these require above two or three hundred pounds to begin with So that whilst the great stocks and the lands convenient to navigation are employed in sugars the small capitals and the inland might be employed in the less expensive though not less useful articles I have mentioned every part would flourish and agriculture would have it's share with the other improvements so that the great number might be subsisted at less expence than the few are now maintained All this I am confident could be effected for twenty thousand pounds or less properly laid out and the island by this means be rendered in a few years three times more beneficial to us than it is at present By the neglect of some encouragement of this  kind the great stocks and the running into a staple which required them have by degrees devoured the island It is the nature of vast stocks to create a sort of monopoly and it is the nature of monopoly to aim at great profits from a comparatively little produce but diffuse business and by bringing it within the compass of several you will make them sit down each with a small profit for all cannot hope a fortune but the joint produce of all will be very considerable Indigo was once very greatly produced in Jamaica and it enriched the island to so great a degree that in the parish of Vere where this drug was cultivated they are said to have had no less than three hundred gentlemen's coaches a number I do not imagine even the whole island exceeds at this day and there is great reason to believe that there were many more persons of property in Jamaica formerly than are there now though perhaps they had not those vast fortunes which dazzle us in such a manner at present  CHAP XI  SINCE I have indulged myself so long in a speculation which appears to me very material to the welfare of these colonies I shall venture to say something farther concerning another part of the inhabitants tho' it may perhaps meet no warm reception from those who are the most nearly concerned  The negroes in our colonies endure a slavery more compleat and attended with far worse circumstances than what any people in their condition suffer in any other part of the world or have suffered in any other period of time Proofs of this are not wanting The prodigious waste which we experience in this unhappy part of our species is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth The island of Barbadoes the negroes upon which do not amount to eighty thousand notwithstanding all the means which they use to increase them by propagation notwithstanding that the climate is in every respect except that of being more wholsome exactly resembling the climate from whence they come notwithstanding all this Barbadoes lies under a necessity of an annual recruit of five thousand slaves to keep up the stock at the number I have mentioned This prodigiou  failure which is at least in the same proportion in all our islands shews demonstratively that some uncommon and insupportable hardship lies upon the negroes which wears them down in such a surprising manner and this I imagine is principally the excessive labour which they undergo For previously I suppose that none of the inhabitants of the countries between the tropics are capable even in their own climates of near so much labour without great prejudice to them as our people are in ours But in our plantations the blacks work severely for five days without any relaxation or intermission for the benefit of the master and the other two days they are obliged to labour for their own subsistence during the rest of the week and this I imagine with the other circumstances of great severity which depress their spirits naturally cuts off great numbers as well as disqualifies those who remain from supplying this waste by natural propagation  The planter will say that if he is to allow his negroes more recreation and to indulge them in more hours of absence from their work he can never reimburse himself for the charge he has been at in the purchase of the slave nor make the profits which induced him to go to that expence But this though it appears plausible enough at first because the slaves are very dear and because they  do not yield above ten or twelve pounds a head annually clear profit by their labour is notwithstanding very fallacious For let it be considered that out of their stock of eighty thousand in Barbadoes there die every year five thousand negroes more than are born in that island in effect this people is under a necessity of being entirely renewed every sixteen years and what must we think of the management of a people who far from increasing greatly as those who have no loss by wars ought to do must in so short a space of time as sixteen years without foreign recruits be entirely consumed to a man Let us suppose that these slaves stand the Barbadians in no more than twenty pounds a head out of the ship whereas in reality they cost a great deal more this makes one hundred thousand pounds every year and in sixteen years one million six hundred thousand pounds A sum really astonishing and amounting to a fourth of the value of every thing they export  Now suppose that by allowing a more moderate labour and some other indulgences a great number of these deaths might be prevented and many I think it is probable would so be prevented and that they could keep up within a thousand of their stock and why they could not entirely keep it up by such means I cannot possibly guess they would save in this way eighty thousand pounds  every year But from thence we must deduct the time in which these slaves have been unemployed I suppose that all reasonable indulgences might be given of every sort for the difference of forty thousand pounds which is the labour of four thousand slaves This will be far from a small allowance especially as in this way less time will be lost by sickness and the surgeon will have less employment Then after all deductions by behaving like good men good masters and good christians the inhabitants of this one island would save forty thousand pounds a year which if instead of being saved it were lost by such a proceeding it ought to be considered as a necessary loss and borne accordingly  This matter though not I think before shewn in this same light seems in itself extremely clear but if it were yet clearer there are several gentlemen of the WestIndies who could not comprehend it though a waggoner in England will comprehend very clearly that if he works his horse but moderately and feeds him well he will draw more profit from him in the end than if he never gave him an hour's respite in the day from his work and at night turned him upon the common for his subsistence I am far from contending in favour of an effeminate indulgence to these people I know that they are stubborn and intractable for the most part  and that they must be ruled with a rod of iron I would have them ruled but not crushed with it I would have a humanity exercised which is consistent with steadiness And I think it clear from the whole course of history that those nations which have behaved with the greatest humanity to their slaves were always best served and ran the least hazard from their rebellions And I am the more convinced of the necessity of these indulgences as slaves certainly cannot go through so much work as freemen The mind goes a great way in every thing and when a man knows that this labour is for himself and that the more he labours the more he is to acquire this consciousness carries him through and supports him beneath fatigues under which he otherwise would have sunk  The prejudice this saving would be to the African trade is I know an objection which to some would appear very plausible But surely one cannot hear without horror of a trade which must depend for it's support upon the annual murder of several thousands of innocent men and indeed nothing could excuse the slave trade at all but the necessity we are under of peopling our colonies and the consideration that the slaves we buy were in the same condition in Africa either hereditary or taken in war But in fact if the waste of these men should become less the price  would fall then if a due order were taken the same demand might be kept by the extending our colonies which is now produced by the havock made of the people This is the case on the continent where though the slaves increase there is an annual call for seven thousand at least  The principal time I would have reserved for the indulgence I propose to be granted to the slaves is Sunday or the Lord's day a day which is profaned in a manner altogether scandalous in our colonies On this day I would have them regularly attend at church I would have them particularly the children carefully full as carefully as any others instructed in the principles of religion and virtue and especially in the humility submission and honesty which become their condition The rest of the day might be devoted to innocent recreation to these days of relaxation and with the same exercises should be added some days in the grand festivals of Christmass Easter and Whitsuntide and perhaps four or five days in the year besides Such methods would by degrees habituate their masters not to think them a sort of beasts and without souls as some of them do at present who treat them accordingly and the slaves would of course grow more honest tractable and less of eyeservants unless the sanctions of religion the precepts of morality and all the habits  of an early institution be of no advantage to mankind Indeed I have before me an  Oldmixon  author if he may be so called who treats the notion of bringing the negroes to christianity with contempt and talks of it at the best as a thing of indifference But besides that he appears to me a writer of every little judgment I cannot conceive with what face any body who pretends to inform the public can set up as an advocate for irreligion barbarism and gross ignorance  CHAP XII  IT is said that the law of England is favourable to liberty and so far this observation is just that when we had men in a servile condition amongst us the law took advantage even of neglects of the master to enfranchise the villain and seemed for that purpose even to subtilize a little because our ancestors judged that freemen were the real support of the kingdom What if in our colonies we should go so far as to find out some medium between liberty and absolute slavery in which we might place all mulattoes after a certain limited servitude to the owner of the mother and such blacks who being born in the islands their masters for their good services should think proper in some degree to enfranchise  These might have land allotted them or where that could not be spared some sort of fixed employment from either of which they should be obliged to pay a certain moderate rent to the public Whatever they should acquire above this to be the reward of their industry The necessity of paying the rent would keep them from idleness and when men are once set to work through necessity they will not stop there but they will gradually strive for conveniencies and some even for superfluities All this will add to the demand for our goods and the colony will be strengthened by the addition of so many men who will have an interest of their own to fight for  There is amongst others a very bad custom in our colonies of multipyling their houshold slaves far beyond reason and necessity It is not uncommon for families of no very great fortunes to have twentyfive or thirty in the capacity of menial servants only These are so many hands taken from planting to be of no manner of use to the public but they are infinitely the most dangerous of the slaves for being at all times about our people they come to abate of that great reverence which the field negroes have for the whites without losing any thing of the resentment of their condition which is common to both And besides in any insurrection they have it more  in their power to strike a sudden and fatal blow Surely a sumptuary law might be contrived to restrain the number of these menial slaves as there might and ought to be one strictly enjoining all who keep five servants to have one white man and one white woman amongst them without any power of being indulged in a contrary practice as it ought to be a rule never to be broken through to have not only the overseers but even all the drivers white men  The alarms we are under at the news of any petty armament in the WestIndies is a demonstrative proof of the weakness of our condition there which is however so far from rousing us to seek any proper remedy that there are not wanting of the people of that country many who would use a thousand pretences to prevent our taking the only possible means of securing their own possessions from danger as the majority of men will always be found ready to prefer some present gain to their future and more permanent interests But the apparent and dangerous progress of the French ought methinks to rouse us from our long inaction and to animate us to enterprise some regulations in a strain of policy far superior to any thing I have ventured to hint for the interest of the commerce and the honour of the counsels of the British nation  British North America PART VII  CHAP I  IT is somewhat difficult to ascertain the bounds of the English property in North America to the northern and Western sides for to the Northward it should seem that we might extend our claims quite to the pole itself nor does any nation seem inclined to dispute the property of this Northermost country with us France has by the treaty of Utrecht ceded to us Hudson's bay the streights of Hudson and all the country bordering upon that bay and those streights If we should chuse to take our stand upon the Northern extremity of New Britain or Terra de Labrador and look to the South we have a territory extending in that aspect from the th to the st degree of North latitude and consequently more than seventeen hundred  miles long in a direct line This country is all the way washed by the Atlantic ocean on the East to the South it has the small remains of the Spanish Florida but to the Westward our bounds are disputed by our enemies and do not seem well agreed upon amongst ourselves They who govern themselves by the charters to our colonies run their jurisdiction quite across the continent to the SouthSea others contract our rights to the hither ranks of the Missisippi and take four of the great lakes into our dominions But upon what grounds they have fixed upon that river as a barrier other than that rivers or mountains seem to be a species of natural boundaries I cannot determine Others upon the same grounds I suppose have contracted us within limits yet narrower they make the Apalachian mountains the lake Ontario and the river St Laurence the most Westerly frontier of our rights in America The French agreeing in some respects with these latter or the latter rather agreeing with the French whose maps they have for a long time servilely and shamefully copied have made the mountains hem us in from their Southern commencement to about the th degree of North latitude or thereabouts where this long chain terminates then they draw a line slanting to the NorthEast by which they cut off a great part of the provinces of NewYork  New England and Nova Scotia and leave our bounds at such a distance from the river St Laurence as they judge convenient  This distribution and the military dispositions which the French have made to support it form the principal cause of the quarrel which now subsists between the two kingdoms and it is the issue of this quarrel which must instruct future geographers in adjusting the boundaries of the two nations For the present I shall only mention what we have settled without offering any opinion of my own concerning our bounds Our rights in Nova Scotia have been already ascertained and established in a clear and cogent manner but with regard to our claims in the Ohio and Missisippi the rashness of some writers in a matter which is a public concern seems to me very blameable Some of them timidly or ignorantly drawing our territories into a very inconvenient narrowness whilst others have madly claimed all North America from sea to sea some would give us very narrow bounds whilst others will hear of no bounds at all  Posterity will perhaps think it unaccountable that in a matter of such importance we could have been so thoughtless as to leave on our back such a nation as France without determining in any manner even sufficiently clear to settle our own demands what part of  the country was our own right or what we determined to leave to the discretion of our neighbours or that wholly intent upon settling the sea coast we have never cast an eye into the country to discover the necessity of making a barrier against them with a proper force which formerly did not need to have been a very great one nor to be maintained at any great expence That cheap and timely caution would have saved us thousands of lives and millions of money but the hour is now passed  In the ensuing discourse I think it better neither to consider our settlements directly in the order of the time of their establishment nor of their advantage to the mother country but as they lie near one another North and South from New England to Carolina reserving for the end the new settlements on the Northern and Southern extremities those of Nova Scotia and Georgia and the unsettled countries about Hudson's bay  CHAP II  WE derive our rights in America from the discovery of Sebastian Cabot who first made the Northern continent in The fact is sufficiently certain to establish a right to our settlements in North America but the particulars are not known distinctly enough to encourage me to enter into a detail of his voyage The country was in general called Newfoundland a name which is now appropriated solely to an island upon it's coast It was a long time before we made any attempt to settle this country though in this point we were no more backward than our neighbours who probably did not abstain so long out of respect to our prior discovery Sir Walter Raleigh shewed the way by planting a colony in the Southern part which he called Virginia However the spirit of colonization was not yet fully raised Men lived at ease in their own country and the new settlement of Virginia though dressed up in all the showy colours which eloquence could bestow upon it gave adventurers but little encouragement The affairs of North America were in the hands of an exclusive company and they prospered accordingly  Things remained in this condition until the latter end of the reign of James the first From the commencement of the reformation in England two parties of protestants subsisted amongst us the first had chosen gradually and almost imperceptibly to recede from the church of Rome softening the lines rather than erasing the figure they made but very little alteration in the appearances of things And the people seeing the exterior so little altered hardly perceived the great changes they had made in the doctrines of their religion The other party of a warmer temper had more zeal and less policy Several of them had fled from the persecution in queen Mary's days and they returned in those of queen Elizabeth with minds sufficiently heated by resentment of their sufferings and by the perpetual disputations which had exercised them all the while they were abroad Abroad they learned an aversion to the episcopal order and to religious ceremonies of every sort they were impregnated with an high spirit of liberty and had a strong tendency to the republican form of government Queen Elizabeth had enough of the blood of Harry the eighth to make her impatient of an opposition to her will especially in matters of religion in which she had an high opinion of her own knowledge She advised with this party but very little in the alterations  which she thought proper to make and disliking the notions which they seemed to entertain in politics she kept them down during the whole course of her reign with an uniform and inflexible severity  However the party was far enough from being destroyed The merit of their sufferings the affected plainness of their dress the gravity of their deportment the use of scripture phrases upon the most ordinary occasions and even their names which had something striking and venerable as being borrowed from the old testament or having a sort of affected relation to religious matters gained them a general esteem amongst sober people of ordinary understandings This party was very numerous and their zeal made them yet more considerable than their numbers They were commonly called puritans  When king James came to the throne he had a very fair opportunity of pacifying matters or at worst he might have left them in the condition he found them but it happened quite otherwise The unkingly disputation at Hamptoncourt did more to encourage the puritans to persevere in their opinions by the notice which was taken of them than all king James's logic as a scholar backed with all his power as a king could do to suppress that party They were persecuted but not destroyed they were exasperated and yet left powerful and a severity was exercised  towards them which at once exposed the weakness and the ill intentions of the government  In this state things continued until the accession of Charles when they were far from mending This prince endowed with many great virtues had very few amiable qualities As grave as the puritans themselves he could never engage the licentious part of the world in his favour and that gravity being turned against the puritans made him but the more odious to them He gave himself up entirely to the church and churchmen and he finished his ill conduct in this respect by conferring the first ecclesiastical dignity of the kingdom and a great sway in temporal affairs upon doctor Laud Hardly fit to direct a college he was called to govern a kingdom He was one of those indiscreet men of good intentions who are the people in the world that make the worst figure in politics This man thought he did good service to religion by a scrupulous enquiry into the manner in which the ministers every where conformed to the regulations of the former reigns He deprived great numbers for nonconformity Not satisfied with this in which perhaps he was justifiable enough if he had managed prudently he made new regulations and introduced on a people already abhorrent of the most necessary ceremonies ceremonies of a new kind of a most useless nature and such as  were even ridiculous if the serious consequences which attended them may not intitle them to be considered as matters of importance  Several great men disgusted at the proceedings of the court and entertaining very rearsonable apprehensions for the public liberty to make themselves popular attached themselves to the popular notions of religion and affected to maintain them with great zeal Others became puritans through principle And now their affairs put on a respectable appearance in proportion as they became of consequence their sufferings seemed to be more and more grievous the severities of Laud had raised not terror as formerly but a sort of indignant hatred and they became every day further and further from listening to the least terms of agreement with surplices organs commonprayer or table at the West end of the church As they who are serious about trifles are serious indeed their lives began to grow miserable to several on account of these ceremonies and rather than be obliged to submit to them there was no part of the world to which they would not have fled with chearfulness  Early in the reign of king James a number of persons of this persuasion had sought refuge in Holland in which though a country of the greatest religious freedom in the world they did not find themselves better satisfied than they had been in England There they  were tolerated indeed but watched their zeal began to have dangerous languors for want of opposition and being without power or consequence they grew tired of the indolent security of their sanctuary they chose to remove to a place where they should see no superior and therefore they sent an agent to England who agreed with the council of Plymouth for a tract of land in America within their jurisdiction to settle in after they had obtained from the king a privilege to do so The Plymouth council was a company who by their charter had not only all the coast of North America from Nova Scotia to the Southern parts of Carolina the whole country being then distinguished by the names of South and North Virginia as a scene for their exclusive trade but they had the entire property of the soil besides  This colony established itself at a place which they called New Plymouth They were but few in number they landed in a bad season and they were not at all supported but from their private funds The winter was premature and terribly cold The country was all covered with wood and afforded very little for the refreshment of persons sickly with such a voyage or for sustenance of an infant people Near half of them perished by the scurvy by want and the severity of the climate but they who survived not dispirited  with their losses nor with the hardships they were still to endure supported by the vigour which was then the character of Englishmen and by the satisfaction of finding themselves out of the reach of the spiritual arm they reduced this savage country to yield them a tolerable livelihood and by degrees a comfortable subsistence  This little establishment was made in the year Several of their brethren in England labouring under the same difficulties took the same methods of escaping from them The colony of puritans insensibly increased but as yet they had not extended themselves much beyond New Plymouth It was in the year that the colony began to flourish in such a manner that they soon became a considerable people By the close of the ensuing year they had built four towns Salem Dorchester Charlestown and Boston which has since become the capital of NewEngland That enthusiasm which was reversing every thing at home and which is so dangerous in every settled community proved of admirable service here It became a principle of life and vigour that enabled them to conquer all the difficulties of a savage country Their exact and sober manners proved a substitute for a proper subordination and regular form of government which they had for some time wanted and the want of which  in such a country had otherwise been felt very severely  And now not only they who found themselves uneasy at home upon a religious account but several on account of the then profitable trade of furs and skins and for the sake of the fishery were invited to settle in New England But this colony received it's principal assistance from the discontent of several great men of the puritan party who were it's protectors and who entertained a design of setling amongst them in New England if they should fail in the measures they were pursuing for establishing the liberty and reforming the religion of their mother country They sollicited grants in New England and were at a great expence in settling them Amongst these patentees we see the lords Brooke Say and Seale the Pelhams the Hampdens and the Pyms the names which afterwards appeared with so much eclat upon a greater stage It was said that sir Matthew Boynton sir William Constable sir Arthur Haslerig and Oliver Cromwell were actually upon the point of embarking for New England when archbishop Laud unwilling that so many objects of his hatred should be removed out of the reach of his power applied for and obtained an order from the court to put a stop to these transportations and thus he kept forcibly from venting itself that virulent humour which he lived  to see the destruction of himself his order his religion his master and the constitution of his country However he was not able to prevail so far as to hinder New England from receiving vast reinforcements as well of the clergy who were deprived of their livings or not admitted to them for nonconformity as of such of the laity who adhered to their opinions  CHAP III  THE part of New England called Massachuset's Bay had now settlements very thick all along the sea shore Some slips from these were planted in the province of Main and New Hampshire being torn from the original stock by the religious violence which was the chief characteristic of the first settlers in New England The patentees we last mentioned principally settled upon the river Connecticut and established a separate and independent government there some persons having before that fixed themselves upon the borders of this river who fled from the tyranny arising from the religious differences which were moulded into the first principles of the Plymouth and Massachuset's colonies  For a considerable time the people of New England had hardly any that deserved the name of a regular form of government The  court took very little care of them By their charter they were empowered to establish such an order and to make such laws as they pleased provided they were not contrary to the laws of England A point not easily settled neither was there any means appointed for settling it As they who composed the new colonies were generally persons of a contracted way of thinking and most violent enthusiasts they imitated the Jewish polity in almost all respects and adopted the books of Moses as the law of the land The first laws which they made were grounded upon them and were therefore very ill suited to the customs genius or circumstances of that country and of those times for which reason they have since fallen into difuse  As to religion it was as I have said the puritan In England this could hardly be considered as a formed sect at the time of their emigration since several who had received episcopal ordination were reckoned to belong to it But as soon as they found themselves at liberty in America they fell into a way very little different from the independent mode Every parish was sovereign within itself Synods indeed were occasionally called but they served only to prepare and digest matters which were to receive their sanction from the approbation of the several churches The synods could exercise no  branch of ecclesiastical jurisdiction either as to doctrine or to discipline They had no power of excommunication They could only refuse to hold communion with those whose principles and practices they disliked The magistrates assisted in those synods not only to hear but to deliberate and determine From such a form as this great religious freedom might one would have imagined be well expected But the truth is they had no idea at all of such a freedom The very doctrine of any sort of toleration was so odious to the greater part that one of the first persecutions set up here was against a small party which arose amongst themselves who were hardy enough to maintain that the civil magistrate had no lawful power to use compulsory measures in affairs of religion After harrassing these people by all the vexatious ways imaginable they obliged them to fly out of their jurisdiction These emigrants settled themselves to the Southward near Cape Cod where they formed a new government upon their own principles and built a town which they called Providence This has since made the fourth and smallest but not the worst inhabited of the New England governments called Rhode Island from an island of that name which forms a part of it As a persecution gave rise to the first settlement of New England so a subsequent persecution in this  colony gave rise to new colonies and this facilitated the spreading of the people over the country  If men merely for the moderation of their sentiments were exposed to such severe treatment it was not to be expected that others should escape unpunished The very first colony had hardly set it's foot on shore in America when finding that some amongst them were false brethren and ventured to make use of the common prayer they found means of making the country so uneasy to them that they were glad to fly back to England  As soon as they began to think of making laws I find no less than five about matters of religion all contrived and not only contrived but executed in some respects with so much rigour that the persecution which drove the puritans out of England might be considered as great lenity and indulgence in the comparison For in the first of these laws they deprive every one who does not communicate with their established church of the right to his freedom or a vote in the election of any of their magistrates In the second they sentence to banishment any who should oppose the fourth commandment or deny the validity of infant baptism or the authority of magistrates In the third they condemn quakers to banishment and make it  capital for them to return And not stopping at the offenders they lay heavy fines upon all who should bring them into the province or even harbour them for an hour In the fourth they provide banishment and death in case of return for jesuits and Popish priests of every denomination In the fifth they decree death to any who shall worship images After they had provided such a complete code of persecution they were not long without opportunities of reading bloody lectures upon it The quakers warmed with that spirit which animates the beginning of most sects had spread their doctrines all over the British dominions in Europe and began at last to spread them with equal zeal in America The clergy and the magistrates in NewEngland took the alarm they seized upon some of those people they set them in the stocks and in the pillory without effect they scourged they imprisoned they banished them they treated all those who seemed to commiserate their sufferings with great rigour but their persecution had no other effect than to inflame their own cruelty and the zeal of the sufferers The constancy of the quakers under their sufferings begot a pity and esteem for their persons and an approbation of their doctrines their proselytes increased the quakers returned as fast as they were banished and the fury of the ruling party was raised to  such a height that they proceeded to the most sanguinary extremities Upon the law they had made they seized at different times upon five of those who had returned from banishment condemned and hanged them It is unknown how far their madness had extended if an order from the king and council in England about the year had not interposed to restrain them  It is a task not very agreeable to insist upon such matters but in reality things of this nature form the greatest part of the history of New England for along time They persecuted the anabaptists who were no inconsiderable body amongst them with almost an equal severity In short this people who in England could not bear being chastised with rods had no sooner got free from their fetters than they scourged their fellow refugees with scorpions though the absurdity as well as the injustice of such a proceeding in them might stare them in the face  One may observe that men of all persuasions confine the word persecution and all the ill ideas of injustice and violence which belong to it solely to those severities which are exercised upon themselves or upon the party they are inclined to favour Whatever is inflicted upon others is a just punishment upon obstinate impiety and not a restraint upon conscientious differences The persecution we  have ourselves suffered is a good ground for retaliation against an old enemy and if one of our friends and fellow sufferers should prove so wicked as to quit our cause and weaken it by his dissention he deserves to be punished yet more than the old enemy himself Besides this the zealous never fail to draw political inferences from religious tenets by which they interest the magistrate in the dispute and then to the heat of a religious fervour is added the fury of a party zeal All intercourse is cut off between the parties They lose all knowledge of each other tho' countrymen and neighbours and are therefore easily imposed upon with the most absurd stories concerning each others opinions and practices They judge of the hatred of the adverse side by their own Then fear is added to their hatred and preventive injuries arise from their fear The remembrance of the past the dread of the future the present ill will join together to urge them forward to the most violent courses  Such is the manner of proceeding of religious parties towards each other and in this respect the New England people are not worse than the rest of mankind nor was their severity any just matter of reflection upon that mode of religion which they profess No religion whatsoever true or false can excuse it's own members or accuse those of any other  upon the score of persecution The principles which give rise to it are common to all mankind and they influence them as they are men and not as they belong to this or that persuasion In all persuasions the bigots are persecutors the men of a cool and reasonable piety are favourers of toleration because the former sort of men not taking the pains to be acquainted with the grounds of their adversaries tenets conceive them to be so absurd and monstrous that no man of sense can give into them in good earnest For which reason they are convinced that some oblique bad motive induces them to pretend to the belief of such doctrines and to the maintaining of them with obstinacy This is a very general principle in all religious differences and it is the corner stone of all persecution  Besides the disputes with those of another denomination the independents were for a long time harrassed with one in the bowels of their own churches The stale dispute about grace and works produced dissentions riots and almost a civil war in the colony The famous sir Henry Vane the younger an enthusiastic giddy turbulent man of a no very good disposition came hither with some of the adventurers and rather than remain idle plaid at small games in New England where the people had chosen him governor It is not hard to conceive how such a man at the  head of such a people and engaged in such controversy could throw every thing into confusion In the very height of this hopeful dispute they had a war upon their hands with some of the Indian nations Their country was terribly harrassed and numbers were every day murdered by the incursions of the enemy All this time they had an army in readiness for action which they would not suffer to march even to defend their own lives and possessions because  "many of the officers and soldiers were under a covenant of works"  CHAP IV  WHEN the New England puritans began to breathe a little from these dissentions and had their hands tied up from persecuting the quakers and anabaptists they fell not long after into another madness of a yet more extraordinary and dangerous kind which like some epidemical disease ran through the whole country and which is perhaps one of the most extraordinary delusions recorded in history This tragedy began in the year  There is a town in New England which they fanatically called Salem One Paris was the minister there He had two daughters  troubled with convulsions which being attended with some of those extraordinary appearances not unfrequent in such disorders he imagined they were bewitched As soon as he concluded upon witchcraft as the cause of the distemper the next enquiry was how to find out the person who had bewitched them He cast his eyes upon an Indian servant woman of his own whom he frequently beat and used her with such severity that she at last confessed herself the witch and was committed to gaol where she lay for a long time  The imaginations of the people were not yet sufficiently heated to make a very formal business of this therefore they were content to discharge her from prison after a long confinement and to sell her as a slave for her fees  However as this example set the discourse about witchcraft afloat some people troubled with a similar complaint began to fancy themselves bewitched too Persons in an ill state of health are naturally fond of finding out causes for their distempers especially such as are extraordinary and call the eyes of the public upon them There was perhaps something of malice in the affair besides For one of the first objects whom they fixed upon was Mr Burroughs a gentleman who had formerly been minister of Salem but upon some of the religious disputes which divided the country  he differed with his flock and left them This man was tried with two others for witchcraft by a special commission of oyer and terminer directed to some of the gentlemen of the best fortunes and reputed to be of the best understandings in the country Before these judges a piece of evidence was delivered the most weak and childish the most repugnant to itself and to common sense that perhaps ever was known upon any serious occasion Yet by those judges upon that evidence and the verdict founded upon it this minister a man of a most unexceptionable character and two others men irreproachable in their lives were sentenced to die and accordingly hanged Then these victims of the popular madness were stript naked and their bodies thrown into a pit half covered with earth and left to the discretion of birds and wild beasts Upon the same evidence in a little time after sixteen more suffered death the greatest part of them dying in the most exemplary sentiments of piety and with the strongest professions of their innocence One man refusing to plead suffered in the cruel manner the law directs on that occasion by a slow pressure to death  The imaginations of the people powerfully affected by these shocking examples turned upon nothing but the most gloomy and horrid ideas The most ordinary and innocent  actions were metamorphosed into magical ceremonies and the fury of the people augmented in proportion as this gloom of imagination increased The flame spread with rage and rapidity into every part of country Neither the tenderness of youth nor the infirmity of age nor the honour of the sex nor the sacredness of the ministry nor the respectable condition of fortune or character was the least protection Children of eleven years old were taken up for sorceries The women were stripped in the most shameful manner to search them for magical teats The scorbutic stains common on the skins of old persons were called the devil's pinches This was indisputable evidence against them As such they admitted every idle flying report and even stories of ghosts which they honoured with a name not found in our law books They called them  Spectral Evidence    What these extraordinary testimonies wanted was compleated by the torture by which a number of these unhappy victims were driven to confess whatever their tormentors thought proper to dilate to them Some women owned they had been lain with by the devil and other things equally ridiculous and abominable  It is not difficult to imagine the deplorable state of this province when all mens lives depended upon the caprice and folly of diseased  and distracted minds when revenge and malice had a full opportunity of wreaking themselves in the most dreadful and bloody manner by an instrument that was always in readiness and to which the public phrenzy gave a certain and dangerous effect What was a yet worse circumstance the wretches who suffered the torture being not more pressed to own themselves guilty than to discover their associates and accomplices unable to give any real account named people at random who were immediately taken up and treated in the same cruel manner upon this extorted evidence An universal terror and consternation seized upon all Some prevented accusation and charged themselves with witchcraft and so escaped death Others fled the province and many more were preparing to fly The prisons were crouded people were executed daily yet the rage of the accusers was as fresh as ever and the number of the witches and the bewitched increased every hour A magistrate who had committed forty persons for this crime fatigued with so disagreeable an employment and ashamed of the share he had in it refused to grant any more warrants He was himself immediately accused of sorcery and thought himself happy in leaving his family and fortune and escaping with life out of the province A jury struck with the affecting  manner and the solemn assurances of innocence of a woman brought before them ventured to acquit her but the judges sent them in again and in an imperious manner forced them to find the woman guilty and she was hanged immediately  The magistrates and ministers whose prudence ought to have been employed in healing this distemper and assuaging it's fury threw in new combustible matter They encouraged the accusers they assisted at the examinations and they extorted the confessions of witches None signalized their zeal more upon this occasion than Sir William Phips the governor a New England man of the lowest birth and yet meaner education who having raised a sudden fortune by a lucky accident was knighted and afterwards made governor of this province Doctor Encrease Mather and Doctor Cotton Mather the pillars of the New England church were equally sanguine Several of the most popular ministers after twenty executions had been made addressed Sir William Phips with thanks for what he had done and with exhortations to proceed in so laudable a work  The accusers encouraged in this manner did not know where to stop nor how to proceed They were at a loss for objects They began at last to accuss the judges themselves What was worse the nearest relations of Mr Encrease  Mather were involved and witchcraft began even to approach the governor's own family It was now high time to give things another turn The accusers were discouraged by authority One hundred and fifty who lay in prison were discharged Two hundred more were under accusation they were passed over and those who had received sentence of death were reprieved and in due time pardoned A few cool moments shewed them the gross and stupid error that had carried them away and which was utterly invisible to them all the while they were engaged in this strange prosecution They grew heartily ashamed of what they had done But what was infinitely mortifying the quakers took occasion to attribute all this mischief to a judgment on them for their persecution A general fast was appointed praying God to pardon all the errors of his servants and people in a late tragedy raised amongst them by Satan and his instruments  This was the last paroxism of the puritanic enthusiasm in New England This violent fit carried off so much of that humour that the people there are now grown somewhat like the rest of mankind in their manners and have much abated of their persecuting spirit  It is not an incurious speculation to consider these remarkable sallies of the human mind out of it's ordinary course Whole nations  are often carried away by what would never influence one man of sense The cause is originally weak and to be suppressed without great difficulty but then it's weakness prevents any suspicion of the mischief until it is too late to think of suppressing it at all In such cases the more weak improbable and inconsistent any story is the more powerful and general is it's effect being helped on by design in some by folly in others and kept up by contagion in all The more extraordinary the design the more dreadful the crime the less we examine into the proofs The charge and the evidence of some things is the same However in some time the minds of people cool and they are astonished how they ever came to be so affected  CHAP V  THE events in the history of New England their disputes with their governors the variations in their charters and their wars with the Indians afford very little useful or agreeable matter In their wars there was very little conduct shewn and though they prevailed in the end in a manner to the extirpation of that race of people  yet the Indians had always great advantages in the beginning and the measures of the English to oppose them were generally injudiciously taken Their manner too of treating them in the beginning was so indiscreet for it was in general no worse as to provoke them as much to those wars as the French influence has done since that time  The country which we call New England is in length something less than three hundred miles at the broadest part it is about two hundred if we carry it on to those tracts which are possessed by the French but if we regard the part we have settled in general it does not extend any where very much above sixty miles from the sea coast  This country lies between the st and th degrees of North latitude Though it is situated almost ten degrees nearer the sun than we are in England yet the winter begins earlier lasts longer and is incomparably more severe than it is with us The summer again is extremely hot and more fervently so than in places which lie under the same parallels in Europe However both the heat and the cold are now far more moderate and the constitution of the air in all respects far better than our people found it at their first settlement The clearing away the woods and the opening the ground every  where has by giving a free passage to the air carried off those noxious vapours which were so prejudicial to the health of the first inhabitants The temper of the sky is generally both in summer and in winter very steddy and serene Two months frequently pass without the appearance of a cloud Their rains are heavy and soon over  The soil of New England is various but best as you approach the Southward It affords excellent meadows in the low grounds and very good pasture almost every where They commonly allot at the rate of two acres to the maintenance of a cow The meadows which they reckon the best yield about a ton of hay by the acre Some produce two tons but the hay is rank and sour This country is not very favourable to any of the European kinds of grain The wheat is subject to be blasted the barley is an hungry grain and the oats are lean and chaffy But the Indian corn which makes the general food of the lowest sort of people flourishes here This as it is a species of grain not so universally known in England and as it is that of all others which yields the greatest increase I shall give a short description of it  This plant which the native Americans call weachin is known in some of the Southern parts of America by the name of maize  The ear is about a span in length consisting of eight rows of the corn or more according to the goodness of the ground with about thirty grains in each row On the top of the grain hangs a sort of flower not unlike a tassel of silk of various colours white blue greenish black speckled striped which gives this corn as it grows a very beautiful appearance The grain is of all the colours which prevail in the flower but most frequently yellow and white The stalks grow six or eight feet high and are of a considerable thickness They are less high in New England and other Northern countries than in Virginia and those which lie more to the Southward They are jointed like a cane and at each of these joints shoot out a number of leaves like flags that make very good fodder for the cattle The stalk is full of a juice of which a syrup as sweet as sugar has been frequently made  This grain is generally sowed in little squares and requires a very attentive cultivation The ground in which it flourishes most is light and sandy with a small intermixture of loam About a peck of seed is sufficient for an acre which at a medium produces about twentyfive bushels The New England people not only make bread of this grain but they malt and brew it into a beer which is not contemptible However the greater part of their beer is made of molasses hopped with  the addition sometimes of the tops of the spruce fir infused  They raise in New England besides this and other species of grain a large quantity of flax and have made essays upon hemp that have been far from unsuccessful An acre of their Cowpen land produces about a ton of this commodity but the land is pretty soon exhausted This plant probably requires a climate more uniformly warm than New England for though the greater part of our hemp is brought to us from Northern ports yet it is in the more Southerly provinces of Russia that the best which comes to our market is produced  Their horned cattle are very numerous in New England and some of them very large Oxen have been killed there of eighteen hundred weight Hogs likewise are numerous and particularly excellent and some so large as to weigh twentyfive score They have besides a breed of small horses which are extremely hardy They pace naturally though in no very graceful or easy manner but with such swiftness and for so long a continuance as must appear almost incredible to those who have not experienced it They have a great number of sheep too and of a good kind The wool is of a staple sufficiently long but it is not near so fine as that of England However they manufacture a great deal of it very successfully I have seen cloths made there  which were of as close and firm a contexture tho' not so fine as our best drabs they were thick and as far as I could judge superior for the ordinary wear of country people to any thing we make in England  CHAP VI  THERE are in this country many gentlemen of considerable landed estates which they let to farmers or manage by their stewards or overseers but the greater part of the people is composed of a substantial yeomanry who cultivate their own freeholds without a dependence upon any but providence and their own industry These freeholds generally pass to their children in the way of gavelkind which keeps them from being almost ever able to emerge out of their original happy mediocrity This manner of inheriting has here an additional good effect It makes the people the more ready to go backward into the uncultivated parts of the country where land is to be had at an easy rate and in larger portions The people by their being generally freeholders and by their form of government have a very free bold and republican spirit In no part of the world are the ordinary sort so independent or possess so many of the conveniencies of life they are used from  their infancy to the exercise of arms and they have a militia which for a militia is by no means contemptible and certainly if these men were somewhat more regularly trained and in better subordination it would be impossible to find in any country or in any time ancient or modern an army better constituted than that which New England can furnish This too is much the best peopled of any of our colonies upon the continent It is judged that the four provinces which it comprises contain about three hundred and fifty thousand souls including a very small number of blacks and Indians the rest are whites Douglass who seems to be well informed in this point proportions them as follows  Massachusets bay    Connecticut    Rhode Island    New Hampshire         These four governments are confederated for their common defence We have shewn how these several governments have arisen The most considerable of them for riches and number of people though not for extent of territorry is Massachusets bay This province like the others had originally a power of  chusing every one of their own magistrates the governor the council the assemblyall and of making such laws as they thought proper without sending them home for the approbation of the crown But being accused of having abused this freedom in the latter end of the reign of Charles the second they were deprived of it by a judgment in a  quo warranto  in the king's bench in England They remained from that time to the revolution without any charter Some time after the revolution they received a new one which though very favourable was much inferior to the extensive privileges of the former charter which indeed were too extensive for a colony and what left little more than a nominal dependence on the mother country and the crown itself But now the governor lieutenant governor and the chief places of the law and in the revenue are in the disposal of the crown so is the militia and tho' the council is chosen by the representatives of the people yet the governor has a negative which gives him an influence sufficient to preserve the prerogative entire Appeals for sums above three hundred pounds are admitted to the king and council and all laws passed here must be remitted to England where if they do not receive a negative from the crown in three years they are to be considered as valid and are to have the effect of laws which they  are to have likewise until the time that the king's resolution is known But one point has been long and resolutely disputed in this colony the grant of a certain salary to their governor Many attempts have been made to induce them to this measure but to no effect They think a dependence on the people for his salary the most effectual method of restraining the governor from any unpopular acts To the Massachusets government is united the ancient colony of Plymouth and the territory which is called Main  The colony of Connecticut which lies upon a river of the same name to the South of this province has preserved it's ancient privileges which are now as considerable as those of Massachusets were formerly At the time that the charter of the former was attacked that of this government was threatened with the same fate But they agreed to submit to the king's pleasure therefore no judgment was given against them and being found in this condition at the revolution it was judged that they were in full possession of their old charter and have so continued ever since  The third and smallest of the provinces which compose New England is Rhode Island This consists of a small island of that name and the old plantation of Providence These united plantations had a charter the same with that of Connecticut and they have  preserved it by the same method In this province is an unlimited freedom of religion agreeable to the first principles of it's foundation and though very small it is from thence extremely well peopled  New Hampshire the fourth province is much the largest of them all but not inhabited in proportion This is more Northerly for the greater part than any of the rest It is a royal government that is the crown has the nomination of all the officers of justice and of the militia and the appointment of the council  CHAP VII  THERE is not one of our settlements which can be compared in the abundance of people the number of considerable and trading towns and the manufactures that are carried on in them to New England The most populous and flourishing parts of the mother country hardly make a better appearance Our provinces to the Southward on this continent are recommendable for the generous warmth of the climate and a luxuriance of soil which naturally throws up a vast variety of beautiful and rich vegetable productions but New England is the first in America for cultivation for the number of people and for the order which results from both  Though there are in all the provinces of New England large towns which drive a considerable trade the only one which can deserve to be much insisted upon in a design like ours is Boston the capital of Massachuset's bay the first city of New England and of all North America This city is situated on a peninsula at the bottom of a fine capacious and safe harbour which is defended from the outrages of the sea by a number of islands and rocks which appear above water It is entered but by one safe passage and that is narrow and covered by the cannon of a regular and very strong fortress The harbour is more than sufficient for the great number of vessels which carry on the extensive trade of Boston At the bottom of the bay is a noble pier near two thousand feet in length along which on the North side extends a row of warehouses The head of this pier joins the principal street of the town which is like most of the others spacious and well built The town lies at the bottom of the harbour and forms a very agreeable view It has a town house where the courts meet and the exchange is kept large and of a very tolerable taste of architecture Round the exchange are a great number of well furnished booksellers shops which find employment for five printing presses There are ten churches within this town and it contains at least twenty thousand inhabitants  That we may be enabled to form some judgment of the wealth of this city we must observe that from Christmas to Christmas five hundred vessels cleared out from this port only for a foreign trade and four hundred and thirty were entered inwards to say nothing of coasting and fishing vessels both of which are extremely numerous and said to be equal in number to the others Indeed the trade of New England is great as it supplies a large quantity of goods from within itself but it is yet greater as the people of this country are in a manner the carriers for all the colonies of North America and the WestIndies and even for some parts of Europe They may be considered in this respect as the Dutch of America  The commodities which the country yields are principally masts and yards for which they contract largely with the royal navy pitch tar and turpentine staves lumber boards all sorts of provisions beef pork butter and cheese in large quantities horses and live cattle Indian corn and pease cyder apples hemp and flax Their peltry trade is not very considerable The have a very noble cod fishery upon their coast which employs a vast number of their people they are enabled by this to export annually above thirtytwo thousand quintals of choice cod fish to Spain Italy and the Mediterranean and  about nineteen thousand quintals of the refuse sort to the WestIndies as food for the negroes The quantity of spirits which they distil in Boston from the molasses they bring in from all parts of the WestIndies is as surprising as the cheap rare at which they vend it which is under two shillings a gallon With this they supply almost all the consumption of our colonies in North America the Indian trade there the vast demands of their own and the Newfoundland fishery and in great measure those of the African trade but they are more famous for the quantity and cheapness than for the excellency of their rum  They are almost the only one of our colonies which have much of the woollen and linen manufactures Of the former they have nearly as much as suffices for their own cloathings It is a close and strong but a coarse stubborn sort of cloth A number of presbyterians from the North of Ireland driven thence as it is said by the severity of their landlords from an affinity in religious sentiments chose New England as their place of refuge Those people brought with them their skill in the linen manufactures and meeting very large encouragement they exercised it to the great advantage of this colony At present they make large quantities and of a very good kind their principal settlement is  in a town which in compliment to them is called Londonderry Hats are made in New England which in a clandestine way find a good vent in all the other colonies The setting up these manufactures has been in a great measure a matter necessary to them for as they have not been properly encouraged in some staple commodity by which they might communicate with their mother country while they were cut off from all other resources they must either have abandoned the country or have found means of employing their own skill and industry to draw out of it the necessaries of life The same necessity together with their convenience for building and manning ships has made them the carriers for the other colonies  The business of shipbuilding is one of the most considerable which Boston or the other seaport towns in New England carry on Ships are sometimes built here upon commission but frequently the merchants of New England have them constructed upon their own account and loading them with the produce of the colony naval stores fish and fishoil principally they send them out upon a trading voyage to Spain Portugal or the Mediterranean where having disposed of their cargo they make what advantage they can by freight until such time as they can sell the vessel herself to advantage which they seldom fail  to do in a reasonable time They receive the value of the vessel as well as of the freight of the goods which from time to time they carried and of the cargo with which they sailed originally in bills of exchange upon London for as the people of New England have no commodity to return for the value of above a hundred thousand pounds which they take in various sorts of goods from England but some naval stores and those in no great quantities they are obliged to keep the ballance somewhat even by this circuitous commerce which though not carried on with Great Britain nor with British vessels yet centers init's profits where all the money which the colonies can make in any manner must center at last  I know that complaints have been made of this trade principally because the people of New England not satisfied with carrying out their own produce become carriers for the other colonies particularly for Virginia and Maryland from whom they take tobacco which in contempt of the act of navigation they carry directly to the foreign market Where not having the duty and accumulated charges to which the British merchant is liable to pay they in a manner wholly out him of the trade Again our sugar colonies complain as loudly that the vast trade which New England drives in lumber live stock and provisions with the French and Dutch  sugar islands particularly with the former enables these islands together with the internal advantages they possess greatly to undersell the English plantations That the returns which the people of New England make from these islands being in sugar or the productions of sugar syrups and molasses the rum which is thence distilled prevents the sale of our WestIndia rum That this trade proves doubly disadvantageous to our sugar islands first as it enables the French to sell their sugars cheaper than they could otherwise afford to do and then as it finds them a market for their molasses and other refuse of sugars for which otherwise they could find no market at all because rum interferes with brandy a considerable manufacture of Old France  These considerations were the ground of a complaint made by the islands to the legislature in England some years ago They desired that the exportation of lumber c to the French colonies and the importation of sugars and molasses from thence might be entirely prohibited This was undoubtedly a very nice point to settle On one hand the growth of the French WestIndies was manifest and alarming and it was not to be thought that the French would ever wink at this trade if it had not been of the greatest advantage to them On the other hand the  Northern colonies declared that if they were deprived of so great a branch of their trade it must necessitate them to the establishment of manufactures For if they were cut off from their foreign trade they never could purchase in England the many things for the use or the ornament of life which they have from thence Besides this the French deprived of the provision and lumber of New England must of necessity take every measure to be supplied from their own colonies which would answer their purposes better if they could accomplish it at the same time that it would deprive the New England people of a large and profitable branch of their trade  These points and many more were fully discussed upon both sides The legislature took a middle course They did not entirely prohibit the carrying of lumber to the French islands but they laid a considerable duty upon whatever rum sugars or molasses they should import from thence to enhance by this means the price of lumber and other necessaries to the French and by laying them under difficulties to set the English sugar plantations in some measure upon an equal footing with theirs  This was undoubtedly a very prudent regulation For though it was urged that the Missisippi navigation was so bad that there was no prospect that the French could ever  be supplied with lumber and provisions from thence and that there were no snows in Louisiana the melting of which might facilitate the transportation of lumber into that river yet it was by no means safe to trust to that so as utterly to destroy a trade of our own which employed so much shipping and so many sailors Because we have a thousand instances wherein the driving people to the last streights and putting them under the tuition of such a master as absolute necessity has taught them inventions and excited them to an industry which have compassed things as much regretted at last as they were unforeseen at first  Though no great snows fall in the Southern parts of Louisiana yet to the Northward a great deal falls and not only the Missisippi but the number of other great rivers which it receives overflow annually and they can be in no want of timber convenient enough to navigation And though the passage to the French islands be for such a great way to the windward as to bring them these commodities in a more tedious manner and at a dearer rate is it not much better that they should have them cheap from us than dear from themselves Nor perhaps would even this difficulty which is indeed much less than it is represented bring down the French to the par of our sugar colonies loaded as they are  with taxes groaning under the pressure of many grievances and deformed by an infinite multitude of abuses and enormities nor can they with reason or justice hope for a cure of the evils which they suffer partly from errors of their own and partly from mistakes in England at the expence of the trade of their sister colonies on the continent of America who are entirely guiltless of their sufferings nor is it by restraints on their trade but by an effectual and judicious encouragement of their own that they can hope to remedy these evils and rival the French establishments  The French in permitting us to supply them it is true give us a proof that they have advantages from this trade but this is no proof at all that we derive none from it for on that supposition no trade could be mutually beneficial Nor is it at all certain as it has been suggested that if we left their refuse of sugars upon their hands that they could turn them to no profit If the council of commerce could be made to see distinctly that this trade could not prejudice the sale of their brandy and would only make the trade of rum change hands as the case probably would be and if they could shew as they might what a loss it must be to them entirely to throw away a considerable part of the produce of their lands and which was formerly so valuable  to them there is no doubt but the court would give sufficient encouragement to their own plantations to distil rum and to vend it in such a manner as might the least prejudice the brandies of France and then instead of sending us molasses as they could distil the spirit far cheaper than our islands they would send us the spirit itself and we may know by experience especially in that part of the world how insufficient all regulations are to prevent a counterband which would be so gainful to particulars  After all are we certain that the French would trust for the supply of their islands to Louisiana or to the precarious supplies from Canada would they not redouble their application now made necessary to Cape Breton what experiments would they not make in Cayenne for the timber trade they would certainly try every method and probably would succeed in some of their trials Restraints upon trade are nice things and ought to be well considered Great care ought to be taken in all such how we sacrifice the interests of one part of our territories to those of another and it would be a mistake of the most fatal consequence if we came to think that the shipping seamen commodities or wealth of the British colonies were not effectually the shipping seamen and wealth of Great Britain herself Sentiments of another kind have frequently done us mischief  The general plan of our management with regard to the trade of our colonies methinks ought to be to encourage in every one of them some separate and distinct articles such as not interfering might enable them to trade with each other and all to trade to advantage with their mother country And then where we have rivals in any branch of the trade carried on by our colonies to enable them to send their goods to the foreign market directly using at the same time the wise precaution which the French put in practice to make the ships so employed take the English ports in their way home for our great danger is that they should in that case make their returns in foreign manufactures against which we cannot guard too carefully This and that they should not go largely into manufactures interfering with ours ought to be the only points at which our restrictions should aim These purposes ought not to be compassed by absolute prohibitions and penalties which would be unpolitical and unjust but by the way of diversion by encouraging them to fall into such things as find a demand with ourselves at home By this means Great Britain and all it's dependencies will have a common interest they will mutually play into each other's hands and the trade so dispersed will be of infinitely more advantage to us than if all it's several articles were produced and manufactured within ourselves  I venture on these hints concerning restraints on trade because in fact that of New England rather wants to be supported than to be checked by such restraints It's trade in many of it's branches is clearly on the decline and this circumstance ought to interest us deeply for very valuable is this colony if it never sent us any thing nor took any thing from us as it is the grand barrier of all the rest and as it is the principal magazine which supplies our WestIndies from whence we draw such vast advantages That this valuable colony is far from advancing will appear clearly from the state of one of the principal branches of it's trade that of shipbuilding for four years In the year they built at  oston fortyone topsail vessels burthen in all tons in only thirty in but twenty in they were reduced to fifteen making in the whole but tons of shipping in such a time an astonishing declension How it has been since I have not sufficient information but allowing that the decline has ceased here yet this is surely sufficient to set us upon the nicest enquiry into the cause of that decay and the most effectual measures to retrieve the affairs of so valuable a province particularly if by any illjudged or illintended schemes or by any misgovernment this mischief has happened them  CHAP VIII New York New Jersey and Pensylvania  IT is not certainly known at what time the Swedes and Dutch made their first establishment in North America but it was certainly posterior to our settlement of Virginia and prior to that of New England The Swedes who were no considerable naval power had hardly fixt the rudiments of a colony there than they deserted it The inhabitants without protection or assistance were glad to enter into a coalition with the Dutch that had settled there upon a better plan and to submit to the government of the States The wh  tract possessed or claimed by the two nations whose two colonies were now grown into one extended from the th to the st degree of latitude all along the sea coast They called it Nova Belgia or New Netherlands It continued in their hands until the reign of Charles the second The Dutch war then breaking out in the year Sir Robert Car with three thousand men was sent to reduce it which he did with so little resistance as not to gain him any great honour by the conquest A little after the Dutch by way of reprisal fell upon our colony of Surinam in South  America and conquered it after much the same opposition that we met in the New Netherlands By the treaty of peace which was signed at Breda in it was agreed that things should remain in the state they were at that time Surinam to the Dutch the New Netherlands to the English At that time this was looked upon by many as a bad exchange but it now appears that we have made an excellent bargain for to say nothing of the great disadvantage of having our colonies as it were cutin two by the intervention of a foreign territory this is now one of the best peopled and richest parts of our plantations extremely useful to the others and making very valuable returns to the mother coun  whereas Surinam is comparatively a place of very small consequence very unhealthy and by no art to be made otherwise  The New Netherlands were not long in our possession before they were divided into distinct provinces and laid aside their former appellation The NorthEast part which joined New England was called New York in compliment to the duke of York who had at first the grant of the whole territory This province runs up to the Northward on both sides of the river Hudson for about two hundred miles into the country of the Five nations or Iroquois but it is not in any part  above forty or fifty miles wide It comprehends within it's limits Long Island which lies to the South of Connecticut and is an island inferior to no part of America in excellent ground for the pasturage of horses oxen and sheep or the plentiful produce of every sort of grain  The part of Nova Belgia which lay along the ocean between that and the river Delawar from the Southern part of New York quite down to Maryland was granted to Sir George Carteret and others and called New Jersey from him because he had as the family still has estates in the island of that name This province is bounded upon the West by the river Delawar which divides it from Pensylvania It is in length about one hundred and fifty miles or thereabouts and about fifty in breadth  Pensylvania which lies between New York New Jersey and Maryland and only communicates with the sea by the mouth of the river Delawar is in length about two hundred and fifty miles and in breadth two hundred This territory was granted to the famous Mr William Pen the son of Sir William Pen the admiral in the year  The climate and soil in the three provinces of New York New Jersey and Pensylvania admits of no very remarkable difference  In all these and indeed in all our North American colonies the land near the sea is in general low flat and marshy at a considerable distance from the sea it swells into little hills and then into great even ridges of mountains which hold their course for the most part NorthEast and SouthWest The soil throughout these three provinces is in general extremely fruitful abounding not only in it's native grain the Indian corn but in all such as have been naturalized there from Europe Wheat in such abundance and of so excellent a quality that few parts of the world for the tract which is cultivated exceed it in the one or the other of these particulars nor in barley oats rye buckwheat and every sort of grain which we have here They have a great number of horned cattle horses sheep and hogs All our European poultry abound there game of all kinds is wonderfully plenty deer of several species hares of a kind peculiar to America but inferior in relish to ours wild turkies of a vast size and equal goodness a beautiful species of pheasants only found in this country Every species of herbs or roots which we force in our gardens grow here with great ease and every species of fruit but some as those of peaches and melons in far greater perfection  Their forests abound in excellent timber the oak the ash the beech the chesnut the  cedar the walnut the cypress the hic kory the sassafras and the pine In all parts of our plantations comprehending New York to the Northward quite to the Southern extremity the woods are full of wild vines of three or four species all different from those we have in Europe But whether from some fault in their nature or in the climate or the soil where they grow or what is much more probable from a fault in the planters they have yet produced no wine that deserves to be mentioned It may be remarked in general of the timber of these provinces that it is not so good for shipping as that of New England and Nova Scotia The further Southward you go the timber becomes less compact and rives easily which property as it makes it more useful for staves renders it less serviceable for ships  They raise in all these provinces but much the most largely in Pensylvania great quantities of flax and hemp is a promising article Nor are they deficient in minerals In New York a good deal of iron is found In New Jersey a very rich copper mine has been opened There is no manner of doubt but in time when the people come to multiply sufficiently and experience and want have made them ingenious in opening resources for trade these colonies will become as remarkable for useful metals as they now are for grain These three provinces as are all those we have in  North America are extremely well watered They have however observed in New England that as they clear the country a vast number of little brooks are quite lost and the mills upon them by this loss rendered useless They even observe that this cutting down the woods has affected the river Connecticut itself the largest in New England and that it has grown distinguishably shallower I do not know whether the same remark has been made in Pensylvania and New York But whatever they have lost in water which where there is such a plenty is no great loss has been amply compensated by the great salubrity of the air which has arisen from the cultivation of the country At present those I describe are for the greater part as healthv as can be wished  As the climate and soil of the provinces of New York New Jersey and Pensylvania are with a very little difference the same so there is no difference in the commodities in which they trade which are wheat flour barley oats Indian corn peas beef pork cheese butter cyder beer flax hemp and flaxseed linseed oil furs and deerskins staves lumber and iron Their markets are the same with those which the people of New England use and these colonies have a share in the logwood trade and that which is carried on with the Spanish and French plantations  CHAP IX  THE province of New York has two cities the first is called by the name of the province itself It was denominated New Amsterdam when the Dutch possessed it but it has changed it's name along with it's masters This city is most commodiously situated for trade upon an excellent harbour in an island called Manahatton about fourteen miles long and four or five broad This island lies just in the mouth of the river Hudson which discharges itself here after a long course This is one of the noblest rivers in America It is navigable upwards of two hundred miles The tide flows one hundred and fifty  The city of New York contains near twelve hundred houses and between seven and eight thousand inhabitants the descendants of Dutch and English It is well and commodiously built and has a very good aspect from the sea but is by no means properly fortified There is no house in New York worth less than one hundred pounds sterling so that there is in no part the least appearance of poverty or meanness There is one large church built for the church of England worship and three others a Dutch  a French and a Lutheran The town has a very flourishing trade and in which great profits are made The merchants are wealthy and the people in general most comfortably provided for and with a moderate labour From the year to two hundred and thirtytwo vessels have been entered in this port and two hundred and eightysix cleared outwards In these vessels were shipped six thousand seven hundred and thirty one tons of provisions chiefly flour and a vast quantity of grain of which I have no particular account The inhabitants of this colony are about eighty thousand They are an hospitable people and fond of strangers There is here a general toleration of all religious persuasions  Upon the same river Hudson about one hundred and fifty miles from New York is Albany a town of not so much note for it's number of houses or inhabitants as for the great trade which is carried on with the Indians and indeed by connivance with the French for the use of the same people This trade takes off a great quantity of coarse woollen goods such as strouds and duffils and with these guns hatchets knives hoes kettles powder and shot besides shirts and cloaths ready made and several other articles Here it is that the treaties and other transactions  between us and the Iroquois Indians are negotiated  This nation or combination of Five nations united by an ancient and inviolable league amongst themselves were the oldest the most steddy and most effectual ally we have found amongst the Indians This people by their unanimity firmness military skill and policy have raised themselves to be the greatest and most formidable power in all America they have reduced a vast number of nations and brought under their power a territory twice as large as the kingdom of France but they have not increased their subjects in proportion As their manner of warring is implacable and barbarous they reign the lords of a prodigious desart inhabited only by a few scattered insignificant tribes whom they have permitted to live out of a contempt of their power and who are all in the lowest state of subjection And yet this once mighty and victorious nation though it has always used the policy of incorporating with itself a great many of the prisoners they make in war is in a very declining condition About sixty years ago it was computed that they had ten thousand fighting men at this day they cannot raise upwards of fifteen hundred So much have wars epidemical diseases and the unnatural union of the vices of civilized nations with the manners  of savages reduced this numerous people But they are not only much lessened at this day in their numbers but in their disposition to employ what numbers they have left in our service Amongst other neglects which I have no pleasure in mentioning and no hopes of seeing amended this of inattention or worse treatment of the Indians is one and a capital one The Iroquois have lately had a sixth nation added to their confederacy that of the Tuscaroras who fled from our province of Carolina being chaced from thence in a war with the English These they have received into the league and the whole confederacy seems more inclined to the French interest than ours  CHAP X  NEW Jersey by the perpetual disputes which subsisted between the people and the proprietaries whilst it continued a proprietary government was kept for a long time in a very feeble state but within a few years it has begun to reap some of the advantages which it might have had earlier from the proper management of so fine a province and so advantageous a situation They raise very great quantities of grain at present and are increased to near sixty thousand souls but  they have yet no town of any consequence Perth Amboy which is their capital has not upwards of two hundred houses and though this town has a very fine harbour capable of receiving and securing ships of great burthen yet as the people of New Jersey have been used to send their produce to the markets of New York and Philadelphia to which they are contiguous they find it hard as it always is in such cases to draw the trade out of the old channel for there the correspondences are fixed the method of dealing established credits given and a ready market for needy dealers who in all countries are sufficiently numerous so that the trade of this town which is the only town of any trade worth notice in New Jersey is still inconsiderable in the year only fortyone vessels have entered inwards and only thirtyeight cleared out in which were exported six thousand four hundred and twentyfour barrels of flour one hundred and sixtyeight thousand weight of bread three hundred and fourteen barrels of beef and pork seventeen thousand nine hundred and fortyone bushels of grain fourteen thousand weight of hemp with some butter hams beer flaxseed bariron and lumber  CHAP XI  I Find it of late a notion pretty current that proprietary governments are a sort of check to the growth of the colonies which they superintend It is certain that abuses have been and still do subsist in that species of government and abuses of as bad a kind may I believe be found by persons of no great penetration in all our governments but if there were any truth in this observation the province of Pensylvania would prove an illustrious exception to it  William Pen in his capacity of a divine and of a moral writer is certainly not of the first rank and his works are of no great estimation except amongst his own people but in his capacity of a legislator and the founder of so flourishing a commonwealth he deserves great honour amongst all mankind a commonwealth which in the space of about seventy years from a beginning of a few hundreds of refugees and indigent men has grown to be a numerous and flourishing people a people who from a perfect wilderness have brought their territory to a state of great cultivation and filled it with wealthy and populous towns and who in the midst of a fierce and lawless race of men have preserved themselves with unarmed hands and passive principles  by the rules of moderation and justice better than any other people has done by policy and arms For Mr Pen when for his father's services and by his own interest at court he obtained the inheritance of this country and it's government saw that he could make the grant of value to him only by making the country as agreeable to all people as ease and good government could make it To this purpose he began by purchasing the soil at a very low rate indeed from the original possessors to whom it was of little use By this cheap act of justice at the beginning he made all his dealings for the future the more easy by prepossessing the Indians with a favourable opinion of him and his designs The other part of his plan which was to people this country after he had secured the possession of it he saw much facilitated by the uneasiness of his brethren the quakers in England who refusing to pay tythes and other church dues suffered a great deal from the spiritual courts Their high opinion of and regard for the man who was an honour to their new church made them the more ready to follow him over the vast ocean into an untried climate and country Neither was he himself wanting in any thing which could encourage them For he expended large sums in transporting and finding them in all necessaries and not aiming at a hidden profit he disposed  of his land at a very light purchase But what crowned all was that noble charter of privileges by which he made them as free as any people in the world and which has since drawn such vast numbers of so many different persuasions and such various countries to put themselves under the protection of his laws He made the most perfect freedom both religious and civil the basis of this establishment and this has done more towards the settling of the province and towards the settling of it in a strong and permanent manner than the wisest regulations could have done upon any other plan All persons who profess to believe one God are freely tolerated those who believe in Jesus Christ of whatever denomination are not excluded from employments and posts  This great man lived to see an extensive country called after his own name he lived to see it peopled by his own wisdom the people free and flourishing and the most flourishing people in it of his own persuasion he lived to lay the foundations of a splendid and wealthy city he lived to see it promise every thing from the situation which he himself had chosen and the encouragement which he himself had given it he lived to see all this but he died in the Fleet prison  It is but just that in such a subject we should allot a little room to do honour to  those great men whose virtue and generosity have contributed to the peopling of the earth and to the freedom and happiness of mankind who have preferred the interest of a remote posterity and times unknown to their own fortunes and to the quiet and security of their own lives Now Great Britain and all America reap great benefits from his labours and his losses and his posterity have a vast estate out of the quitrents of that province whose establishment was the ruin of their predecessor's moderate fortune  CHAP XII  PENSYLVANIA is inhabited by upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand people half of whom are Germans Swedes or Dutch Here you see the quakers churchmen calvinists lutherans catholics methodists menists moravians independents the anabaptists and the dumplers a sort of German sect that live in something like a religious society wear long beards and a habit resembling that of friars in short the diversity of people religions nations and languages here is prodigious and the harmony in which they live together no less edifying For though every man who wishes well to religion is sorry to see the diversity  which prevails and would by all humane and honest methods endeavour to prevent it yet when once the evil has happened when there is no longer an union of sentiments it is glorious to preserve at least an union of affections it is a beautiful prospect to see men take and give an equal liberty to see them live if not as belonging to the same church yet to the same christian religion and if not to the same religion yet to the same great fraternity of mankind I do not observe that the quakers who had and who still have in a great measure the power in their hands have made use of it in any sort to persecute except in the single case of George Keith whom they first imprisoned and then banished out of the province This Keith was originally a minister of the church of England then a quaker and afterwards returned to his former ministry But whilst he remained with the friends he was a most troublesome and litigious man was for pushing the particularities of quakerism to yet more extravagant lengths and for making new refinements even where the most enthusiastic thought they had gone far enough which raised such a storm as shook the church he then adhered to to the very foundations  This little sally into intolerance as it is a single instance and with great provocation ought by no means to be imputed to the principles  of the quakers considering the ample and humane latitude they have allowed in all other respects It was certainly a very right policy to encourage the importation of foreigners into Pensylvania as well as into our other colonies By this we are great gainers without any diminution of the inhabitants of Great Britain But it has been frequently observed and as it should seem very justly complained of that they are left still foreigners and likely to continue so for many generations as they have schools taught books printed and even the common news paper in their own language by which means and that they possess large tracts of the country without any intermixture of English there is no appearance of their blending and becoming one people with us This certainly is a great irregularity and the greater as these foreigners by their industry frugality and a hard way of living in which they greatly exceed our people have in a manner thrust them out in several places so as to threaten the colony with the danger of being wholly foreign in language manners and perhaps even inclinations In the year were imported into Pensylvania and it's dependencies four thousand three hundred and seventeen Germans whereas of British and Irish but one thousand arrived a considerable number if  it was not so vastly overballanced by that of the foreigners  I do by no means think that this sort of transplantations ought to be discouraged I only observe along with others that the manner of their settlement ought to be regulated and means sought to have them naturalized in reality  The present troubles have very unhappily reversed the system so long pursued and with such great success in this part of the world The Pensylvanians have suffered severely by the incursions of the savage Americans as well as their neighbours but the quakers could not be prevailed upon by what did not directly affect those of their own communion for they were out of the way of mischief in the more settled parts to relinquish their pacific principles for which reason a considerable opposition in which however we must do the quakers the justice to observe they were not unanimous was made both within their assembly as well as without doors against granting any money to carry on the war and the same or a more vigorous opposition was made against passing a militia bill A bill of this kind has at length passed but scarcely such as the circumstances of the country and the exigencies of the times required It may perhaps appear an error to have placed so great a part of the government in the hands of men who  hold principles directly opposite to it's end and design As a peaceable industrious honest people the quakers cannot be too much cherished but surely they cannot themselves complain that when by their opinions they make themselves sheep they should not be entrusted with the office since they have not the nature of dogs  CHAP XIII  THERE are so many good towns in the province of Pensylvania even exceeding the capitals of some other provinces that nothing could excuse our passing them by had not Philadelphia drawn our attention wholly to itself This city stands upon a tongue of land immediately at the confluence of two fine rivers the Delawar and the Schulkil It is disposed in the form of an oblong designed to extend two miles from river to river this longest stretch is laid out upon the original plan to compose eight parallel streets all of two miles in length these were to have been intersected by sixteen others each in length a mile broad spacious and even with proper spaces left for the public buildings churches and marketplaces In the center is a square of ten acres round which most of the public buildings are disposed The two  principal streets of the city are each one hundred feet wide and most of the houses have a small garden and orchard from the rivers are cut several canals equally agreeable and beneficial The kays are spacious and fine the principal kay is two hundred feet wide and to this a vessel of five hundred tons may lay her broadside the warehouses are large numerous and commodious and the docks for shipbuilding every way well adapted to their purposes A great number of vessels have been built here twenty have been upon the stocks at a time This city contains exclusive of warehouses and outhouses about two thousand houses most of them of brick and well built it is said there are several of them worth four or five thousand pounds The inhabitants are now about thirteen thousand  There are in this city a great number of very wealthy merchants which is no way surprising when one considers the great trade which it carries on with the English French Spanish and Dutch colonies in America with the Azores the Canaries and the Madeira islands with Great Britain and Ireland with Spain Portugal and Holland and the great profits which are made in many branches of this commerce Besides the quantity of all kinds of the produce of this province which is brought down the rivers Delawar  and Schulkil the former of which is navigable for vessels of one sort or other more than two hundred miles above Philadelphia and the other for very near an hundred the Dutch employ between eight and nine thousand waggons drawn each by four horses in bringing the product of their farms to this market In the year three hundred and three vessels entered inwards at this port and two hundred and ninetyone cleared outwards There are at the other ports of this province customhouse officers but the foreign trade in these places is not worth notice  The city of Philadelphia though as it may be judged far from compleating the original plan yet so far as it is built it is carried on conformably to it and increases in the number and beauty of it's buildings every day And as for the province of which this city is the capital there is no part of British America in a more growing condition In some years more people have transported themselves into Pensylvania than into all the other settlements together In six thousand two hundred and eight persons came to settle here as passengers or servants four fifths of whom at least were from Ireland In short this province has increased so greatly from the time of it's first establishment that lands were given by Mr Pen at first at  the rate of twenty pounds for a thousand acres reserving only a shilling every hundred acres for quitrent and this in some of the best situated parts of the province but now at a great distance from navigation land is granted at twelve pounds the hundred acres and a quitrent of four shillings reserved and the land which is near Philadelphia rents for twenty shillings the acre In many places and at the distance of several miles from that city land sells for twenty years purchase  The Pensylvanians are an industrious and hardy people they are most of them substantial though but a few of the landed people can be considered as rich but they are all well lodged well fed and for their condition well clad too and this at the more easy rate as the inferior people manufacture most of all their own wear both linens and woollens There are but few blacks not in all the fortieth part of the people of the province  CHAP XIV VIRGINIA  THE whole country which the English now possess in North America was at first called Virginia but by parcelling of several portions of it into distinct grants and governments the country which still bears the name is now reduced to that tract which has the river Potowmack upon the North the bay of Chesapeak upon the East and Carolina upon the South To the Westward the grants extend it to the SouthSea but their planting goes no farther than the great Allegany mountains which boundaries leave this province in length two hundred and forty miles and in breadth about two hundred lying between the fiftyfisth and fortieth degrees of North latitude  The whole face of this country is so extremely low towards the sea that when you are come even within fifteen fathom soundings you can hardly distinguish land from the mast head However all this coast of America has one useful particularity that you know your distance exactly by the soundings which uniformly and gradually diminish as  you approach the land The trees appear as if they rose out of the water and afford the stranger a very uncommon and not a disagreeable view In sailing to Virginia or Maryland you pass a streight between two points of land called the Capes of Virginia which opens a passage into the bay of Chesapeak one of the largest and safest bays perhaps in the world for it enters the country near three hundred miles from the South to the North having the Eastern side of Maryland and a small portion of Virginia on the same peninsula to cover it from the Atlantic ocean This bay is about eighteen miles broad for a considerable way and seven where it is narrowest the waters in most places being nine fathom deep Through it's whole extent it receives both on the Eastern and Western side a vast number of fine navigable rivers Not to mention those of Maryland from the side of Virginia it receives James River York River the Rappahannock and the Potowmack  All these great rivers in the order they are here set down from South to North discharge themselves with several smaller ones into the bay of Chesapeak and they are all not only navigable themselves for very large vessels a prodigious way into the country but have so many creeks and receive such a number of smaller navigable rivers as renders the communication  of all parts of this country infinitely more easy than that of any country without exception in the world The Potowmack is navigable for near two hundred miles being nine miles broad at it's mouth and for a vast way not less than seven The other three are navigable upwards of eighty and in the windings of their several courses approach one another so nearly that the distance between one and the other is in some parts not more than ten sometimes not above five miles whereas in others there is fifty miles space between each of these rivers The planters load and unload vessels of great burthen each at his own door which as their commodities are bulky and of small value in proportion to their bulk is a very fortunate circumstance else they could never afford to send their tobacco to market low as they sell it and charged as it is in England with a duty of six times it's original value  The climate and soil of Virginia was undoubtedly much heightened in the first descriptions for political reasons but after making all the necessary abatements which experience since taught us we still find it a most excellent country The heats in summer are excessively great but not without the allay of refreshing sea breezes The weather is changeable and the changes sudden and violent Their winter frosts come on without the least warning  After a warm day towards the setting in of winter so intense a cold often succeeds as to freeze over the broadest and deepest of their great rivers in one night but these frosts as well as their rains are rather violent than of long continuance They have frequent and violent thunder and lightning but it does rarely any mischief In general the sky is clear and the air thin pure and penetrating  The soil in the low grounds of Virginia is a dark fat mould which for many years without any manure yields plentifully whatever is committed to it The soil as you leave the rivers becomes light and sandy is sooner exhausted than the low country but is yet of a warm and generous nature which helped by a kindly sun yields tobacco and corn extremely well There is no better wheat than what is produced in this province and Maryland but the culture of tobacco employs all their attention and almost all their hands so that they scarcely cultivate wheat enough for their own use  It may be judged from the climate and the soil I have described in what excellence and plenty every sort of fruit is found in Virginia Their forests are full of timber trees of all kinds and their plains are covered for almost the whole year with a prodigious number of flowers and flowering shrubs of colours so  rich and of a scent so fragrant that they occasioned the name of Florida to be originally given to this country This country produces several medicinal herbs and roots particularly the snake root and of late the celebrated ginseng of the Chinese has been discovered there  Horned cattle and hogs have multiplied almost beyond belief though at the first settlement the country was utterly destitute of these animals The meat of the former is as much below the flesh of our oxen as that of the latter exceeds that of our hogs The animals natural to the country are deer of which there are great numbers a sort of panther or tyger bears wolves foxes racoons squirrels wild cats and one very uncommon animal called the opossum This creature is about the size of a cat and besides the belly which it has in common with all others has a false one beneath it with a pretty large aperture at the end towards the hinder legs Within this bag or belly on the usual parts of the common belly are a number of teats upon these when the female of this creature conceives the young are formed and there they hang like fruit upon the stalk until they grow in bulk and weight to their appointed size then they drop off and are received in the false belly from which they go out at pleasure and in which they take refuge when any danger threatens them  They have all our sorts of tame and wild fowl in equal perfection and some which we have not and a vast number of birds of various kinds valuable for their beauty or their note The white owl of Virginia is far larger than the species which we have and is all over of a bright silver coloured plumage except one black spot upon his breast they have the nightingale called from the country a most beautiful one whose feathers are crimson and blue the mocking bird thought to excel all others in his own note and he imitates the notes of all others the rock bird very sociable and his society very agreeable by the sweetness of his music the humming bird the smallest of all the winged creation and the most beautiful all arrayed in scarlet green and gold This bird is said to live by licking off the dew that adheres to the flowers he is too delicate to be brought alive into England The seacoasts and rivers of Virginia abound not only in several of the species of fish known in Europe but in most of those kinds which are peculiar to America The reptiles are many it were tedious to enumerate all the kinds of serpents bred here the rattle snake is the principal and too well known in general to need any description  CHAP XV  THE great commodiousness of navigation and the scarcity of handicraftsmen have rendered all the attempts of the government to establish towns in Virginia ineffectual James'stown which was anciently the capital is dwindled into an insignificant village and Williamsburg though the capital at present the seat of the governor the place of holding the assembly and courts of justice and a college for the study of arts and sciences is yet but a small town However in this town are the best public buildings in British America The college one hundred and thirtyfive feet long in front resembling Chelsea hospital the capital directly facing it at the other end of the design of a noble street not unlike the college in the fashion and the size of the building where the assembly and courts of justice are held and the public offices kept and the church in the form of a cross large and well ornamented  The great staple commodity of this country as well as Maryland is tobacco This plant is aboriginal in America and of very ancient use though neither so generally cultivated nor so well manufactured as it has been since the coming of the Europeans When at it's  just height it is as tall as an ordinary sized man the stalk is straight hairy and clammy the leaves alternate of a faded yellowish green and towards the lower part of the plant of a great size The seeds of tobacco are first sown in beds from whence they are transplanted the first rainy weather into a ground disposed into little hillocks like an hop garden In a month's time from their transplantation they become a foot high they then top them and prune off the lower leaves and with great attention clean them from weeds and worms twice a week in about six weeks after they attain to their full growth and they begin then to turn brownish By these marks they judge the tobacco to be ripe They cut down the plants as fast as they ripen heap them up and let them lie a night to sweat the next day they carry them to the tobacco house which is built to admit as much air as is consistent with keeping out rain where they are hung separately to dry for four or five weeks then they take them down in moist weather for else they will crumble to dust After this they are laid upon sticks and covered up close to sweat for a week or two longer the servants strip and sort them the top being the best the bottom the worst tobacco then they make them up in hogsheads or form them into rolls Wet seasons must be carefully laid hold on for all  this work else the tobacco will not be sufficiently pliable  In trade they distinguish two sorts of tobacco the first is called Aranokoe from Maryland and the Northern parts of Virginia this is strong and hot in the mouth but it sells very well in the markets of Holland Germany and the North The other sort is called sweet scented the best of which is from James's and York rivers in the Southern parts of Virginia There is no commodity to which the revenue is so much obliged as to this It produces a vast sum and yet appears to lay but a very inconsiderable burthen upon the people in England all the weight in reality falls upon the planter who is kept down by the lowness of the original price and as we have two provinces which deal in the same commodity if the people of Virginia were to take measures to straiten the market and raise the price those of Maryland would certainly take the advantage of it the people of Virginia would take the same advantage of those of Maryland in a like case They have no prospect of ever bettering their condition and they are the less able to endure it as they live in general luxuriously and to the full extent of their fortunes Therefore any failure in the sale of their goods brings them heavily in debt to the merchants in London who get mortgages on their estates  which are consumed to the bone with the canker of an eight per cent usury But however the planters may complain of the tobacco trade the revenue flourishes by it for it draws near three hundred thousand a year from this one article only and the exported tobacco the far greater part of the profits of which come to the English merchant brings almost as great a sum annually into the kingdom To say nothing of the great advantage we derive from being supplied from our own colonies with that for which the rest of Europe pays ready money besides the employment of two hundred large vessels and a proportionable number of seamen which are occupied in this trade From us the Virginians take every article for convenience or ornament which they use their own manufacture does not deserve to be mentioned The two colonies export about eighty thousand hogsheads of tobacco of eight hundred weight They likewise trade largely with the WestIndies in lumber pitch tar corn and provisions They send home flax hemp iron staves and walnut and cedar plank  The number of white people in Virginia is between sixty and seventy thousand and they are growing every day more numerous by the migration of the Irish who not succeeding so well in Pensylvania as the more frugal and industrious Germans sell their lands in  that province to the latter and take up new ground in the remote counties in Virginia Maryland and North Carolina These are chiefly presbyterians from the Northern part of Ireland who in America are generally called Scotch Irish In Virginia there are likewise settled a considerable number of French refugees but much the larger part of the inhabitants are the negro slaves who cannot be much fewer than a hundred thousand souls they annually import into the two tobacco colonies between three and four thousand of these slaves The negroes here do not stand in need of such vast recruits as the WestIndia stock they rather increase than diminish a blessing derived from a more moderate labour better food and a more healthy climate The inhabitants of Virginia are a chearful hospitable and many of them a genteel though somewhat vain and ostentatious people they are for the greater part of the established church of England nor until lately did they tolerate any other Now they have some few meetinghouses of presbyterians and quakers  CHAP XVI  THIS of Virginia is the most ancient of our colonies Tho' strictly speaking the first attempts to settle a colony were not made in Virginia but in that part of North Carolina which immediately borders upon it Sir Walter Raleigh the most extraordinary genius of his own or perhaps any other time a penetrating statesman an accomplished courtier a deep scholar a fine writer a great soldier and one of the ablest seamen in the world this vast genius that pierced so far and ran through so many things was of a fiery excentric kind which led him into daring expeditions and uncommon projects which not being understood by a timid prince and envied and hated by the rivals he had in so many ways of life ruined him at last In person he ran infinite risques in Guiana in search of gold mines and when this country was first discovered he looked through the work of an age at one glance and saw how advantageous it might be made to the trade of England He was the first man in England who had a right conception of the advantages of settlements abroad he was then the only person who had a thorough insight into trade and who saw clearly the  proper methods of promoting it He applied to court and got together a company which was composed of several persons of distinction and several eminent merchants who agreed to open a trade and settle a colony in that part of the world which in honour of queen Elizabeth he called Virginia  Raleigh had too much business upon his hands at court and found too few to second him in his designs to enable him to support the establishment with the spirit in which he began it If ever any design had an ominous beginning and seemed to forbid any attempts for carrying it on it was that of the first settlement of Virginia Near half of the first colony was destroyed by the savages and the rest consumed and worn down by fatigue and famine deserted the country and returned home in despair The second colony was cut off to a man in a manner unknown but they were supposed to be destroyed by the Indians The third had the same dismal fate and the fourth quarrelling amongst themselves neglecting their agriculture to hunt for gold and provoking the Indians by their insolent and unguarded behaviour lost several of their people and were returning the poor remains of them in a famishing and desperate condition to England when just in the mouth of Chesapeak bay they met the lord Delawar with a squadron loaded with provision and  every thing for their relief and defence who persuaded them to return  This nobleman travelled with as much zeal and assiduity to cherish and support the froward infancy of this unpromising colony as some have used in it's better times for purposes of another kind Regardless of his life and inattentive to his fortune he entered upon this long and dangerous voyage and accepted this barren province which had nothing of a government but it's anxieties and it's cares merely for the service of his country and he had no other reward than that retired and inward satisfaction which a good mind feels in indulging it's own propensity to virtue and the prospect of those just honours which the latest posterity will take a pleasure in bestowing upon those who prefer the interest of posterity to their own After he had prevailed upon the people to return he comforted them under their misfortunes he pointed out their causes and uniting the tenderness of a father with the steady severity of a magistrate he healed their divisions and reconciled them to authority and government by making them feel by his conduct what a blessing it could be made  When he had settled the colony within itself his next care was to put them upon a proper footing with regard to the Indians whom he found very haughty and assuming  on account of the late miserable state of the English but by some welltimed and vigorous steps he humbled them shewed he had power to chastise them and courage to exert that power and after having awed them into very peaceable dispositions and settled his colony in a very growing condition he retired home for the benefit of his health which by his constant attention to business and the air of an uncultivated country had been impaired but he left his son with the spirit of his father his deputy and Sir Thomas Gates Sir George Summers the honourable George Piercy Sir Ferdinand Wenman and Mr Newport for his council These with other persons of rank and fortune attended him on this expedition which gave a credit to the colony Though there are in England many young gentlemen of fortunes disproportioned to their rank I fear we should not see the names of so many of them engaged in an expedition which had no better appearance than this had at that time  Lord Delawar did not forget the colony on his return to England but considering himself as nearer the fountain head thought it his duty to turn the spring of the royal favour more copiously upon the province which he superintended For eight years together he was indefatigable in doing every thing that could tend to the peopling the support and  the good government of this settlement and he died in the pursuit of the same object in his voyage to Virginia with a large supply of people cloathing and goods  It is one of the most necessary and I am sure it is one of the most pleasing parts of this design to do justice to the names of those men who by their greatness of mind their wisdom and their goodness have brought into the pale of civility and religion these rude and uncultivated parts of the globe who could discern the rudiments of a future people wanting only time to be unfolded in the seed who could perceive amidst the losses and disappointments and expences of a beginning colony the great advantages to be derived to their country from such undertakings and who could pursue them in spite of the malignity and narrow wisdom of the world The ancient world had it's Osyris and Erichthonius who taught them the use of grain their Bacchus who instructed them in the culture of the vine and their Orpheus and Linus who first built towns and formed civil societies The people of America will not fail when time has made things venerable and when an intermixture of fable has moulded useful truths into popular opinions to mention with equal gratitude and perhaps similar heightening circumstances her Columbus her Castro  her Gasca her De Poincy her Delawar her Baltimore and her Pen  CHAP XVII  THE colony of Virginia was so fast rooted by the care of lord Delawar that it was enabled to stand two terrible storms two massacres made by the Indians in which the whole colony was nearly cut off and to subdue that people so as to put it utterly out of their power for many years past to give them the least disturbance  In the fatal troubles which brought Charles the first to the block and overturned the constitution of England many of the cavaliers fled for refuge to this colony which by the general disposition of the inhabitants and the virtue of Sir William Berkley held out for the crown until the parliament rather by stratagem than force reduced them And what is remarkable if it may be depended upon with any certainty they deposed Cromwell's governor set up Sir William Berkley again and declared for king Charles the second a good while even before the news of Oliver's death could arrive in America  After the restoration there is nothing very interesting in their history except that soon after a sort of rebellion which arose in the  province from mismanagements in the government from the decay of their trade and from exorbitant grants inconsiderately made which included the settled property of many people this raised a general discontent amongst the planters which was fomented and brought to blaze out into an actual war by a young gentleman whose name was Bacon He was an agreeable man of a graceful presence and winning carriage He had been bred to the law had a lively and fluent expression fit to set off a popular cause and to influence men who were ready to hear whatever could be said to colour in a proper manner what was already strongly drawn by their own feelings This man by a specious or perhaps a real tho' illjudged regard for the public good finding the governor slow in his preparations against the Indians who were ravaging the frontiers of the province took up arms without any commission to act against the enemy When he had sufficient force for this purpose he found himself in a condition not only to act against the enemy but to give law to the governor and to force him to give a sanction by his authority to those proceedings which were meant to destroy it  Bacon armed with the commission of a general and followed by the whole force of the colony prepared to march against the Indians when Sir William Berkley the governor  freed from the immediate terror of his forces recalled him proclaimed him a traitor and issued a reward for apprehending him as such This brought matters to extremities the people were universally inflamed Bacon adhered to what he had done the people adhered to Bacon and the governor who seemed no ways inclined to temporize or yield to the storm fled over the river Potowmack and proclaimed all Bacon's adherents traitors He put himself at the head of a small body of troops which he had raised in Maryland and of such of the Virginians as were faithful to him and wrote to England for supplies On the other hand Bacon marched to the capital called an assembly and for six months together disposed all things according to his own pleasure Every thing was now hastening to a civil war when all was quieted in as sudden a manner as it had begun by the natural death of Bacon in the very height of the confusion The people unable to act without a head proposed terms of accommodation the terms were listened to and peace was restored and kept without any disturbance not so much by the removal of the grievances complained of as by the arrival of a regiment from England which remained a long time in the country It must be remarked in honour of the moderation of the government that no person suffered in his life or his estate for this  rebellion which was the more extraordinary as many people at that time were very earnest in solliciting grants of land in Virginia  The events in all countries which are not the residence of the supreme power and have no concern in the great business of transacting war and peace have generally but little to engage the attention of the reader I have therefore intirely omitted the tedious detail of the governors and their several transactions with which my materials so plentifully supply me and for the same reason I shall be very concise in my account of Maryland which agreeing altogether with Virginia in it's climate soil products trade and genius of the inhabitants and having few or no remarkable events to recommend it will save much trouble in that article  CHAP XVIII MARYLAND  IT was in the reign of Charles the first that the Lord Baltimore applied for a patent for a part of Virginia and obtained in a grant of a tract of land upon Chesapeak bay of about an hundred and forty miles long and an hundred and thirty broad having Pensylvania then in the hands of the  Dutch upon the North the Atlantic ocean upon the East and the river Potowmack upon the South in honour of the queen he called this province Maryland  Lord Baltimore was a Roman catholic and was induced to attempt this settlement in America in hopes of enjoying liberty of conscience for himself and for such of his friends to whom the severity of the laws might loosen their ties to their country and make them prefer an easy banishment with freedom to the conveniencies of England embittered as they were by the sharpness of the laws and the popular odium which hung over them The court at that time was certainly very little inclined to treat the Roman catholics in a harsh manner neither had they in reality the least appearance of reason to do so but the laws themselves were of a rigorous constitution and however the court might be inclined to relax them they could not in policy do it but with great reserve The puritan party perpetually accused the court and indeed the episcopal church of a desire of returning to popery and this accusation was so popular that it was not in the power of the court to shew the papists that indulgence which they desired The laws were still executed with very little mitigation and they were in themselves of a much keener temper than those which had driven the puritans about  the same time to seek a refuge in the same part of the world These reasons made lord Baltimore desirous to have and the court willing to give him a place of retreat in America  The settlement of the colony cost the lord Baltimore a large sum It was made under his auspices by his brother and about two hundred persons Roman catholics and most of them of good families This settlement at the beginning did not meet with the same difficulties which embarrassed and retarded most of the others we had made The people were generally of the better sort a proper subordination was observed amongst them and the Indians gave and took so little offence that they ceded one half of their principal town and some time after the whole of it to these strangers The Indian women taught ours how to make bread of their corn their men went out to hunt and fish with the English they assisted them in the chace and sold them the game they took themselves for a trifling consideration so that the new settlers had a sort of town ready built ground ready cleared for their subsistence and no enemy to harrass them  They lived thus without much trouble or fear until some illdisposed persons in Virginia insinuated to the Indians that the Baltimore colony had designs upon them that  they were Spaniards and not Englishmen and such other stories as they judged proper to sow the seeds of suspicion and enmity in the minds of these people Upon the first appearance that the malice of the Virginians had taken effect the new planters were not wanting to themselves They built a good fort with all expedition and took every other necessary measure for their defence but they continued still to treat the Indians with so much kindness that partly by that and partly by the awe of their arms the ill designs of their enemies were defeated  As the colony met with so few obstructions and as the Roman catholics in England were yet more severely treated in proportion as the court party declined numbers constantly arrived to replenish the settlement which the lord proprietor omitted no care and witheld no expence to support and encourage until the usurpation overturned the government at home and deprived him of his rights abroad Maryland remained under the governors appointed by the parliament and by Cromwell until the restoration when lord Baltimore was reinstated in his former possessions which he cultivated with his former wisdom care and moderation No people could live in greater ease and security and his lordship willing that as many as possible should enjoy the benefits of his mild and equitable administration  gave his consent to an act of assembly which he had before promoted in his province for allowing a free and unlimited toleration for all who professed the christian religion of whatever denomination This liberty which was never in the least instance violated encouraged a great number not only of the church of England but of presbyterians quakers and all kinds of dissenters to settle in Maryland which before that was almost wholly in the hands of Roman catholics  This lord though guilty of no maleadministration in his government though a zealous Roman catholic and firmly attached to the cause of king James the second could not prevent his charter from being questioned in that arbitrary reign and a suit from being commenced to deprive him of the property and jurisdiction of a province granted by the royal favour and peopled at such a vast expence of his own But it was the error of that weak and unfortunate reign neither to know it's friends nor it's enemies but by a blind precipitate conduct to hurry on every thing of whatever consequence with almost equal heat and to imagine that the sound of the royal authority was sufficient to justify every sort of conduct to every sort of people But these injuries could not shake the honour and constancy of lord Baltimore nor tempt him to desert the cause of his master Upon  the revolution he had no reason to expect any favour yet he met with more than king James had intended him he was deprived indeed of all his jurisdiction but he was left the profits of his province which were by no means inconsiderable and when his descendants had conformed to the church of England they were restored to all their rights as fully as the legislature has thought fit that any proprietor should enjoy them  When upon the revolution power changed hands in that province the new men made but an indifferent requital for the liberties and indulgences they had enjoyed under the old administration They not only deprived the Roman catholics of all share in the government but of all the rights of freemen they have even adopted the whole body of the penal laws of England against them they are at this day meditating new laws in the same spirit and they would undoubtedly go to the greatest lengths in this respect if the moderation and good sense of the government in England did not set some bounds to their bigotry thinking very prudently that it were highly unjust and equally impolitic to allow an asylum abroad to any religious persuasions which they judged it improper to tolerate at home and then to deprive them of it's protection recollecting at the same time in the various changes which our religion and government has undergone  which have in their turns rendered every sort of party and religion obnoxious to the reigning powers that this American asylum which has been admitted in the hottest times of persecution at home has proved of infinite service not only to the present peace of England but to the prosperity of it's commerce and the establishment of it's power There are a sort of men who will not see so plain a truth and they are the persons who would appear to contend most warmly for liberty but it is only a party liberty for which they contend a liberty which they would stretch out one way only to narrow it in another they are not ashamed of using the very same pretences for persecuting others that their enemies use for persecuting them  This colony as for a long time it had with Pensylvania the honour of being unstained with any religious persecution so neither they nor the Pensylvanians have ever until very lately been harrassed by the calamity of any war offensive or defensive with their Indian neighbours with whom they always lived in the most exemplary harmony Indeed in a war which the Indians made upon the colony of Virginia by mistake they made an incursion into the bounds of Maryland but they were soon sensible of their mistake and attoned for it This present war indeed has changed every  thing and the Indians have been taught to laugh at all their ancient alliances  Maryland like Virginia has no considerable town and for the same reason the number of navigable creeks and rivers Annapolis is the seat of government It is a small but beautifully situated town upon the river Patuxent  Here is the seat of the governor and the principal customhouse collection The people of Maryland have the same established religion with those of Virginia that of the church of England but here the clergy are provided for in a much more liberal manner and they are the most decent and the best of the clergy in North America They export from Maryland the same things in all respects that they do from Virginia Their tobacco is about forty thousand hogsheads The white inhabitants are about forty thousand the negroes upwards of sixty thousand  CHAP XIX CAROLINA  IT must not be forgot that we formerly called all the coast of North America by the name of Virginia The province properly so called with Maryland and the Carolinas was known by the name of South Virginia By the Spaniards it was considered as part of Florida which country they made to extend from New Mexico to the Atlantic ocean By them it was first discovered but they treated the natives with an inhumanity which filled them with so violent an hatred to the Spanish name as rendered their settlement there very difficult nor did they push it vigorously as the country shewed no marks of producing gold or silver the only things for which the Spaniards then valued any country Florida therefore remained under an entire neglect in Europe until the reign of Charles the ninth king of France  The celebrated leader of the protestants in that kingdom the admiral Chastillon who was not only a great commander but an able statesman was a man of too comprehensive views not to see the advantages of a settlement in America he procured two vessels  to be fitted out for discoveries upon that coast He had it probably in his thoughts to retire thither with those of his persuasion if the success which hitherto suited so ill with his great courage and conduct should at last entirely destroy his cause in France These ships in two months arrived upon the coast of America near the river now called Albemarle in the province of North Carolina The French gave the Indians to understand in the best manner they were able that they were enemies to the Spaniards which secured them a friendly reception and the good offices of the inhabitants They were however in no condition to make any settlement  On their return to France the admiral at this time by the abominable policy of the court apparently in great favour was so well satisfied with the account they had given of the country that in he fitted out five or six ships with as many hundred men aboard to begin a colony there This was accordingly done at the place of their landing in the first expedition They built a fort here which they called Fort Charles as they called the whole country Carolana in honour of their king then reigning The Spaniards who had intelligence of their proceedings dispatched a considerable force to attack this colony who not satisfied with reducing it put all the people to the sword after quarter given and  committing great outrages upon the natives they paved the way for the vengeance which soon after fell upon them for such an unnecessary and unprovoked act of cruelty For though the admiral and his party were by this time destroyed in the infamous massacre of St Bartholomew and though the design of a colony died with him one M de Gorgues a private gentleman fitted out some ships which sailed to that coast purely to revenge the murder of his countrymen and his friends The Indians greedily embraced the opportunity of becoming associates in the punishment of the common enemy They joined in the siege of two or three forts the Spaniards had built there they took them and in all of them put the garrison to the sword without mercy  Satisfied with this action the adventurers returned and happily for us the French court did not understand blinded as they were by their bigotry the advantages which might have been derived from giving America to the protestants as we afterwards did to the dissenters as a place of refuge if they had taken this step most certainly we should have either had no settlements in America at all or they must have been small in extent and precarious in their tenure to what they are at this day  CHAP XX  AFTER the French expedition the country of Carolina remained without any attention from Spaniards French or Enlish until as we observed in the article of Virginia Sir Walter Raleigh projected an establishment there It was not in the part now called Virginia but in North Carolina that our first unhappy settlements were made and destroyed Afterwards the adventurers entered the bay of Chesapeak and fixed a permanent colony to the Northward so that although Carolina was the first part of the Atlantic coast of America which had an European colony yet by an odd caprice it was for a long time deserted by both England and France who settled with infinitely more difficulty in climates much less advantageous or agreeable  It was not until the year in the reign of Charles the second that we had any notion of formally settling that country In that year the earl of Clarendon lord chancellor the duke of Albemarle the lord Craven lord Berkley lord Ashley afterwards earl of Shaftesbury Sir George Carteret Sir William Berkley and Sir George Colleton obtained a charter for the property and jurisdiction of  that country from the st degree of North latitude to the th and being inverted with full power to settle and govern the country they had the model of a constitution framed and a body of fundamental laws compiled by the famous philosopher Mr Locke On this plan the lords proprietors themselves stood in the place of the king gave their assent or dissent as they thought proper to all laws appointed all officers and bestowed all titles of dignity In his turn one of these lords acted for the rest In the province they appointed two other branches in a good measure analogous to the legislature in England They made three ranks or rather classes of nobility The lowest was composed of those to whom they had made grants of twelve thousand acres of land whom they called barons the next order had twentyfour thousand acres or two baronies with the title of cassiques these were to answer our earls the third had two cassiqueships or fortyeight thousand acres and were called landgraves a title in that province analogous to duke This body formed the upper house their lands were not alienable by parcels The lower house was formed as it is in the other colonies of representatives from the several towns or counties But the whole was not called as in the rest of the plantations an assembly but a parliament  They began their first settlement at a point of land towards the Southward of their district between two navigable rivers though of no long course called Ashley and Cowper rivers and there laid the foundation of a city called Charles town which was designed to be what it now is the capital of the province They expended about twelve thousand pounds in the first settlement But it was not chiefly to the funds of the lords proprietors that this province owed it's establishment They observed what advantages the other colonies derived from opening an harbour for refugees and not only from this consideration but from the humane disposition of that excellent man who formed the model of their government they gave an unlimited toleration to people of all religious persuasions This induced a great number of dissenters over whom the then government held a more severe hand than was consistent with justice or policy to transport themselves with their fortunes and families into Carolina They became soon at least as numerous as the churchmen and though they displayed none of that frantic bigotry which disgraced the New England refugees they could not preserve themselves from the jealousy and hatred of those of the church of England who having a majority in one of the assemblies attempted to exclude all dissenters from a right of sitting there This  produced dissentions tumults and riots every day which tore the colony to pieces and hindered it for many years from making that progress which might be expected from it's great natural advantages The people fell into disputes of no less violent a nature with the lords proprietors and provoking the Indians by a series of unjust and violent actions they gave occasion to two wars in which however they were victorious and subdued almost all the Indian nations within their own bounds at this side of the Apalachian mountains  Their intestine distractions and their foreign wars kept the colony so low that an act of parliament if possible to prevent the last ruinous consequences of these divisions put the province under the immediate care and inspection of the crown The lords proprietors making a virtue of necessity accepted a recompence of about twentyfour thousand pounds both for the property and jurisdiction except the earl Granville who kept his eighth part of the property which comprehends very near half of North Carolina on that part which immediately borders upon the province of Virginia Their constitution in those points wherein it differed from that of the other colonies was altered and the country for the more commodious administration of affairs was divided into two distinct independent governments called North Carolina and  South Carolina This was in the year In a little time a firm peace was established with all the neighbouring Indian nations the Cherokees the Creeks and the Cataubas the province began to breathe from it's internal quarrels and it's trade has advanced every year since that time with an astonishing rapidity  CHAP XXI  THESE two provinces lying between the st and th degrees of latitude are upwards of four hundred miles in length and in breadth to the Indian nations near three hundred The climate and soil in these countries do not considerably differ from those of Virginia but where they differ it is much to the advantage of Carolina which is one of the finest climates in the world The heat in summer is very little greater than in Virginia but the winters are milder and shorter and the year in all respects does not come to the same violent extremities However the weather though in general serene as the air is healthy yet like all American weather it makes such quick changes and those so sharp as to oblige the inhabitants to rather more caution in their dress and diet than we are obliged to use in Europe Thunder and lightning is here frequent and it is the  only one of our colonies upon the continent which is subject to hurricanes but they are very rare and not near so violent as those of the WestIndies Part of the month of March and all April May and the greatest part of June are here inexpressibly temperate and agreeable but in July August and for almost the whole of September the heat is very intense and though the winters are sharp especially when the NorthWest wind prevails yet they are seldom severe enough to freeze any considerable water affecting only the mornings and evenings the frosts have never sufficient strength to resist the noonday sun so that many tender plants which do not stand the winter of Virginia flourish in Carolina for they have oranges in great plenty near Charlestown and excellent in their kinds both sweet and sour Olives are rather neglected by the planter than denied by the climate The vegetation of every kind of plant is here almost incredibly quick for there is something so kindly in the air and soil that where the latter has the most barren and unpromising appearance if neglected for a while of itself it shoots out an immense quantity of those various plants and beautiful flowering shrubs and flowers for which this country is so famous and of which Mr Catesby is his Natural History of Carolina has made such fine drawings  The whole country is in a manner one forest where our planters have not cleared it The trees are almost the same in every respect with those produced in Virginia and by the different species of these the quality of the soil is easily known for those grounds which bear the oak the walnut and the hickory are extremely fertile they are of a dark sand intermixed with loam and as all their land abounds with nitre it is a long time before it is exhausted for here they never use any manure The pine barren is the worst of all this is an almost perfectly white sand yet it bears the pine tree and some other useful plants naturally and yields good profit in pitch tar and turpentine from thence and when it is cleared for two or three years together it produces very tolerable crops of Indian corn and pease and when it lies low and is flooded it even answers well for rice But what is the best of all for this province this worst species of it's land is favourable to a species of the most valuable of all it's products to a species of indigo There is another kind of ground which lies low and wet upon the banks of some of their rivers this is called swamp which in some places is in a manner useless in others it is far the richest of all their grounds it is a black fat earth and bears their great staple rice which must have in general a rich moist soil in the greatest  plenty and perfection The country near the sea and at the mouths of the navigable rivers is much the worst for most of the land there is of the species of the pale light sandycoloured ground and what is otherwise in those parts is little better than an unhealthy and unprofitable salt marsh but the country as you advance in it improves continually and at an hundred miles distance from Charlestown where it begins to grow hilly the soil is of a prodigious fertility fitted for every purpose of human life The air is pure and wholsome and the summer heats much more temperate than in the flat country for Carolina is all an even plain for eighty miles from the sea no hill no rock scarce even a pebble to be met with so that even the best parts of the maritime country from this sameness must want something of the fine effect which it's various and beautiful products would have by a more variegated and advantageous disposition but nothing can be imagined more pleasant to the eye than the back country and it's fruitfulness is almost incredible Wheat grows extremely well there and yields a prodigious increase In the other parts of Carolina they raise but little where it is apt to mildew and spend itself in straw and these evils the planters take very little care to redress as they turn their whole attention to the culture of rice which is more profitable and in which they are unrivalled being supplied with what  wheat they want in exchange for this grain from New York and Pensylvania  The land in Carolina is very easily cleared every where as there is little or no underwood Their forests consist mostly of great trees at a considerable distance asunder so that they can clear in Carolina more land in a week than in the forests of Europe they can do in a month Their method is to cut them at about a foot from the ground and then saw the trees into boards or convert them into staves heading or other species of lumber according to the nature of the wood or the demands at the market If they are too far from navigation they heap them together and leave them to rot The roots soon decay and before that they find no inconvenience from them where land is so plenty  The aboriginal animals of this country are in general the same with those of Virginia but there is yet a greater number and variety of beautiful fowls All the animals of Europe are here in plenty black cattle are multiplied prodigiously About fifty years ago it was a thing extraordinary to have above three or four cows now some have a thousand some in North Carolina a great many more but to have two or three hundred is very common These ramble all day at pleasure in the forests but their calves being separated and kept in fenced pastures the cows return  every evening to them they are then milked detained all night milked in the morning and then let loose again The hogs range in the same manner and return like the cows by having shelter and some victuals provided for them at the plantation these are vastly numerous and many quite wild many horned cattle and horses too run wild in their woods though at the first settlement there was not one of these animals in the country They drive a great many cattle from North Carolina every year into Virginia to be slaughtered there and they kill and salt some beef and a good deal of pork for the WestIndies within themselves but the beef is neither so good nor does it keep near so long as what is sent to the same market from Ireland They export a considerable number of live cattle to Pensylvania and the WestIndies Sheep are not so plenty as the black cattle or hogs neither is their flesh so good their wool is very ordinary  CHAP XXII  THE trade of Carolina besides the lumber provisions and the like which it yields in common with the rest of America has three great staple commodities indigo rice and the produce of the pine turpentine tar and pitch The two former commodities South Carolina has intirely to itself and taking in North Carolina this part of America  yields more pitch and tar than all the rest of our colonies  Rice anciently formed by itself the staple of this province this wholsome grain makes a great part of the food of all ranks of people in the Southern parts of the world in the Northern it is not so much in request Whilst the rigour of the act of navigation obliged them to send all their rice directly to England to be reshipped for the markets of Spain and Portugal the charges incident to this regulation lay so heavy upon the trade that the cultivation of rice especially in time of war when these charges were greatly aggravated by the rise of the freight and insurance hardly answered the charges of the planter but now the legislature has relaxed the law in this respect and permits the Carolinians to send their rice directly to any place to the Southward of Cape Finisterre This prudent indulgence has again revived the rice trade and though they have gone largely and with great spirit into the profitable article of indigo it has not diverted their attention from the cultivation of rice they raise now above double the quantity of what they raised some years ago and this branch alone of their commerce is at the lowest estimation worth one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling annually  Indigo is a dye made from a plant of the same name which probably was so called  from India where it was first cultivated and from whence we had for a considerable time the whole of what we consumed in Europe This plant is very like the fern when grown and when young hardly distinguishable from lucerngrass its leaves in general are pennated and terminated by a single lobe the flowers consist of five leaves and are of the papilionaceous kind the uppermost petal being larger and rounder than the rest and lightly furrowed on the side the lower ones are short and end in a point in the middle of the flower is situated the stile which afterwards becomes a pod containing the seeds  They cultivate three sorts of indigo in Carolina which demand the same variety of soils First the French or Hispaniola indigo which striking a long tap root will only flourish in a deep rich soil and therefore though an excellent sort it is not so much cultivated in the maritime parts of Carolina which are generally sandy but no part of the world is more fit to produce it in perfection than the same country an hundred miles backwards it is neglected too on another account for it hardly bears a winter so sharp as that of Carolina  The second sort which is the false guatemala or true bahama bears the winter better is a more tall and vigorous plant is raised in greater quantities from the same compass of  ground is content with the worst soils in the country and is therefore more cultivated than the first sort though inferior in the quality of it's dye  The third sort is the wild indigo which is indigenous here this as it is a native of the country answers the purposes of the planter the best of all with regard to the hardiness of the plant the easiness of the culture and the quantity of the produce of the quality there is some dispute not yet settled amongst the planters themselves nor can they as yet distinctly tell when they are to attribute the faults of their indigo to the nature of the plant to the seasons which have much influence upon it or to some defect in the manufacture  The time of planting the indigo is generally after the first rains succeeding the vernal equinox the seed is sowed in small straight trenches about eighteen or twenty inches asunder when it is at it's height it is generally eighteen inches tall It is fit for cutting if all things answer well in the beginning of July Towards the end of August a second cutting is obtained and if they have a mild autumn there is a third cutting at Michaelmas the indigo land must be weeded every day and the plants cleansed from worms and the plantation attended with the greatest care and diligence about twentyfive negroes may  manage a plantation of fifty acres and compleat the manufacture of the drug besides providing their own necessary subsistence and that of the planter's family Each acre yields if the land be very good sixty or seventy pounds weight of indigo at a medium the produce is fifty pounds When the plant is beginning to blossom it is fit for cutting and when cut great care ought to be taken to bring it to the steeper without pressing or shaking it as a great part of the beauty of the indigo depends upon the fine farina which adheres to the leaves of this plant  The apparatus for making indigo is pretty considerable though not very expensive for besides a pump the whole consists only of vats and tubs of cypress wood common and cheap in this country The indigo when cut is first laid in a vat about twelve or fourteen feet long and four deep to the height of about fourteen inches to macerate and digest Then this vessel which is called the steeper is filled with water the whole having lain from about twelve to sixteen hours according to the weather begins to ferment swell rise and grow sensibly warm at this time spars of wood are run across to prevent it's rising too much and a pin is then set to mark the highest point of it's ascent when it falls below this mark they judge that the fermentation has attained it's due pitch and begins to  abate this directs the manager to open a cock and let off the water into another vat which is called the beater the gross matter that remains in the first vat is carried off to manure the ground for which purpose it is excellent and new cuttings are put in as long as the harvest of this weed continues  When the water strongly impregnated with the particles of the indigo has run into the second vat or beater they attend with a sort of bottomless buckets with long handles to work and agitate it which they do incessantly until it heats froths ferments and rises above the rim of the vessel which contains it to allay this violent fermentation oil is thrown in as the froth rises which instantly sinks it When this beating has continued for twenty thirty or thirtyfive minutes according to the state of the weather for in cool weather it requires the longest continued beating a small muddy grain begins to be formed the salts and other particles of the plant united and dissolved before with the water are now reunited and begin to granulate  To discover these particles the better and to find when the liquor is sufficiently beaten they take up some of it from time to time on a plate or in a glass when it appears in an hopeful condition they let loose some lime water from an adjacent vessel gently stirring the whole which wonderfully facilitates the  operation the indigo granulates more fully the liquor assumes a purplish colour and the whole is troubled and muddy it is now suffered to settle then the clearer part is let to run off into another succession of vessels from whence the water is conveyed away as fast as it clears at the top until nothing remains but a thick mud which is put into bags of coarse linen These are hung up and left for some time until the moisture is entirely drained off To finish the drying this mud is turned out of the bags and worked upon boards of some porous timber with a wooden spatula it is frequently exposed to the morning and evening sun but for a short time only and then it is put into boxes or frames which is called the curing exposed again to the sun in the same cautious manner until with great labour and attention the operation is finished and that valuable drug called indigo fitted for the market The greatest skill and care is required in every part of the process or there may be great danger of ruining the whole the water must not be suffered to remain too short or too long a time either in the steeper or beater the beating itself must be nicely managed so as not to exceed or fall short and in the curing the exact medium between too much or too little drying is not easily attained Nothing but experience can make the overseer skilful in these matters  There are two methods of trying the goodness of indigo by fire and by water if it swims it is good if it sinks it is naught the heavier the worse so if it wholly dissolves in water it is good Another way of proving is by the fire ordeal if it intirely burns away it is good the adulterations remain untouched  There is perhaps no branch of manufacture in which so large profits may be made upon so moderate a fund as that of indigo and there is no country in which this manufacture can be carried on to such advantage as in Carolina where the climate is healthy provision plentiful and cheap and every thing necessary for that business had with the greatest ease To do justice to the Carolinians they have not neglected these advantages and if they continue to improve them with the same spirit in which they have begun and attend diligently to the quality of their goods they must naturally and necessarily come to supply the whole consumption of the world with this commodity and consequently make their country the richest as it is the pleasantest and most fertile part of the British dominions  In all parts of Carolina but especially in North Carolina they make great quantities of turpentine tar and pitch They are all the produce of the pine The turpentine is drawn simply from incisions made in the tree they  are made from as great an height as a man can reach with an hatchet these incisions meet at the bottom of the tree in a point where they pour their contents into a vessel placed to receive them There is nothing further in this process But tar requires a more considerable apparatus and greater trouble They prepare a circular floor of clay declining a little towards the center from this is laid a pipe of wood the upper part of which is even with the floor and reaches ten feet without the circumference under the end the earth is dug away and barrels placed to receive the tar as it runs Upon the floor is built up a large pile of pine wood split in pieces and surrounded with a wall of earth leaving only a small aperture at the top where the fire is first kindled When the fire begins to burn they cover this opening likewise to confine the fire from flaming out and to leave only sufficient heat to force the tar downwards to the floor They temper the heat as they please by running a stick into the wall of clay and giving it air Pitch is made by boiling tar in large iron kettles set in furnaces or burning it in round clay holes made in the earth The greatest quantity of pitch and tar is made in North Carolina  CHAP XXIII  THERE are in the two provinces which compose Carolina ten navigable rivers of a very long course and innumerable smaller ones which fall into them all abounding in fish About fifty or sixty miles from the sea there are falls in most of the great rivers which as you approach their sources become more frequent This is the case of almost all the American rivers at these falls those who navigate these rivers land their goods carry them beyond the cataract on horses or waggons and then reship them below or above it  The mouths of the rivers in North Carolina form but ordinary harbours and do not admit except one at Cape Fear vessels of above seventy or eighty tons so that larger ships are obliged to lie off in a sound called Ocacock which is formed between some islands and the continent This lays a weight upon their trade by the expence of lighterage North Carolina partly upon that occasion but principally that the first settlements were made as near as possible to the capital which lies considerably to the Southward was greatly neglected For a long time it was but ill inhabited and by an indigent and disorderly  people who had little property and hardly any law or government to protect them in what they had As commodious land grew scarce in the other colonies people in low circumstances observing that a great deal of excellent and convenient land was yet to be patented in North Carolina were induced by that circumstance to plant to themselves there Others who saw how they prospered followed their example The government became more attentive to the place as it became more valuable by degrees something of a better order was introduced The effect of which is that though by no means as wealthy as South Carolina North Carolina has many more white people things begin to wear a face of settlement and the difficulties they have lain under are not so many nor so great as to make us neglect all future efforts or hinder us from forming very reasonable expectations of seeing the trade of this country with proper management become a flourishing and fruitful branch of the British American commerce That even now it is far from contemptible may appear by a list of their exported commodities which I shall subjoin  Edenton was formerly the capital of North Carolina if a trifling village can deserve that denomination but the present governor Mr Dobbs has projected one further South upon the river Neus which though it has the  advantage of being something more central is by no means equally well situated for trade which ought always to be of the first consideration in whatever regards any of the colonies However none of their towns are worth mentioning the conveniency of inland navigation in all our Southern colonies and the want of handicraftsmen is a great and almost insuperable obstacle to their ever having any considerable  CHAP XXIV  THE only town in either of the Carolinas which can draw our attention is Charlestown and this is one of the first in North America for size beauty and traffic It's situation I have already mentioned so admirably chosen at the confluence of two navigable rivers It's harbour is good in every respect but that of a bar which hinders vessels of more than two hundred tons burthen from entering The town is regularly and pretty strongly fortified both by nature and art the streets are well cut the houses are large and well built and rent extremely high The church is spacious and executed in a very handsome taste exceeding every thing of that kind which we have in America Here besides the several denominations of dissenters have their meeting houses It contains about eight hundred houses and is the seat of the governor and the  place of meeting of the assembly Several handsome equipages are kept here The planters and merchants are rich and well bred the people are shewy and expensive in their dress and way of living so that every thing conspires to make this by much the liveliest and politest place as it is one of the richest too in all America  The best harbour in this province is far to the Southward on the borders of Georgia called Port Royal This might give a capacious and safe reception to the largest fleets of the greatest bulk and burthen yet the town which is called Beaufort built upon an island of the same name with the harbour is not as yet considerable but it bids fair in time for becoming the first trading town in this part of America  The import trade of South Carolina from GreatBritain and the WestIndies is the same in all respects with that of the rest of the colonies and it is very large Their trade with the Indians is likewise in a very flourishing condition As for it's export both the nature of that and it's prodigious increase may be discerned from the following comparative tables which let us see how much this colony has really advanced in a few years as an attentive consideration of it's natural advantages must shew us how much it must advance if properly managed as there is scarce any improvement  of which this excellent country is not capable  Exported from Charlestown  In the year  Rice barrels  Indigo pounds  Deer skins hds  Pitch barrels  Tar ditto  Turpent ditto  Beef pork c not particularized  In the year  Rice barrels  Indigo pds  Deer skins

deal of live cattle horses cedar cypress and walnut plank bees wax myrtle and some raw silk and cotton  North Carolina which is reputed one of the least flourishing of our settlements and which certainly lay under great difficulties yet is within a few years greatly improved The consequence of this inferior province may appear by  the following view of it's trade which I can take upon me to say is not very far from being exact it is at least sufficiently so to enable us to form a proper idea of this province and it's commerce  Exported from all the ports of NorthCarolina in  Tar barrels  Pitch ditto  Turpetine ditto  Staves no  Shingles no  Lumber feet  Corn bushels  Peas about ditto  Pork beef barrels  Tobacco abt hogsheads  Tanned lea about hundred weight  Deerskins in all ways about  Besides a very considerable quantity of wheat rice bread potatoes bees wax tallow candles bacon hog's lard some cotton and a vast deal of squared timber of walnut and cedar and hoops and heading of all sorts Of late they raise indigo but in what quantity I cannot determine for it is all exported from South Carolina They raise likewise much more tobacco than I have mentioned but this as it is produced on the frontiers of Virginia so it is exported from thence They  export too no inconsiderable quantity of beaver racoon otter fox minx and wild cats skins and in every ship a good deal of live cattle besides what they vend in Virginia Both in North and South Carolina they have made frequent but I think not vigorous nor sufficiently continued efforts in the cultivation of cotton and silk What they have sent home of these commodities is of so excellent a kind as to give us great encouragement to proceed in a business which we have not taken to heart with all that warmth that it's importance in trade and the fitness of the climate for these most valuable articles certainly deserves It was a long time before this province went into the profitable trade of indigo notwithstanding a premium subsisted a good many years for all that should be raised in our plantations the thing was at first despaired of and it was never judged that Carolina could produce this drug but no sooner had a few shewn a spirited and successful example than all went into it so heartily that though it is but about six years since they began I am informed that five hundred thousand weight was made last year and as they go on in a very little time they will supply the market with a commodity which before we purchased every ounce from the French and Spaniards Silk requires still more trouble and a closer attention as yet it proceeds with  languor nor will a premium alone ever suffice to set on foot in a vigorous manner a manufacture which will find great difficulties in any country which does not abound in hands that can work for very trifling wages The want of this advantage in Carolina though no part of the world is fitter for this business and no business could be so advantageous to England will for a very long time be an impediment to the manufacture of raw silk unless some proper well studied and vigorously executed scheme be set on foot for that purpose and surely it is a matter worthy of a very serious consideration America is our great resource this will remain to us when other branches of our trade are decayed or exist no more and therefore we ought to grudge no expence that may enable them to answer this end so effectually as one day to supply the many losses we have already had and the many more we have but too much reason to apprehend in our commerce These expences are not like the expences of war heavy in their nature and precarious in their effects but when judiciously ordered the certain and infallible means of rich and successive harvests of gain to the latest posterity at the momentary charge of a comparatively small quantity of seed and of a moderate husbandry to the present generation  CHAP XXV GEORGIA  IN the year the government observing that a great tract of land in Carolina upon the borders of the Spanish Florida lay waste and unsettled resolved to erect it into a separate province and to send a colony thither This they were the rather induced to do because it lay on the frontier of all our provinces naked and defenceless whereas if it could be properly settled it would be a strong barrier to them all upon that side or at least would be sufficient to protect Carolina from the incursions which the Indians instigated by the French or Spaniards might make upon that province They had it likewise in their view to raise wine oyl and silk and to turn the industry of this new people from the timber and provision trade which the other colonies had gone into too largely into channels more advantageous to the public Laudable designs in every respect though perhaps the means which were taken to put them in execution were not altogether answerable  That whole country which lies between the rivers Savannah and Alatamaha North and South and from the Atlantic ocean on  the East to the great SouthSea upon the West was vested in trustees at the end of that period the property in chief was to revert to the crown This country extends about sixty miles from North and South near the sea but widens in the more remote parts to above one hundred and fifty From the sea to the Apalachian mountains it is not much short of three hundred  In pursuance of the original design the trustees resolved to encourage poor people to settle in the province which had been committed to their care and to this purpose found them in necessaries to transport them into a country of which they had previously published a most exaggerated and flattering description In reality the country differs little from South Carolina but that the summers are yet hotter and the soil in the general of a poorer kind The colony was sent over under the care of Mr Oglethorpe who very generously bestowed his own time and pains without any reward for the advancement of the settlement  The trustees had very well observed that many of our colonies especially that of South Carolina had been very much endangered both internally and externally by suffering the negroes to grow so much more numerous than the whites An error of this kind they judged in a colony which was not only to  defend itself but to be in some sort a protection to the others would have been inexcusable they for that reason forbid the importation of negroes into Georgia In the next place they observed that great mischiefs happened in the other settlements from making vast grants of land which the grantees jobbed out again to the discouragement of the settlers or what was worse suffered to lie idle and uncultivated To avoid this mischief and to prevent the people from becoming wealty and luxurious which they thought inconsistent with the military plan upon which this colony was founded they allowed in the common course to each family but twentyfive acres and none could according to the original scheme by any means come to possess more than five hundred Neither did they give an inheritance in fee simple or to the heirs general of the settlers but granted them their lands inheritable only by their male issue They likewise forbid the importation of rum into the province to prevent the great disorders which they observed to arise in the other parts of North America from the abuse of spirituous liquors  These regulations though well intended and meant to bring about very excellent purposes yet it might at first as it did afterwards appear that they were made without sufficiently consulting the nature of the country or the  disposition of the people which they regarded For in the first place as the climate is excessively hot and field work very laborious in a new colony as the ground must be cleared tilled and sowed all with great and incessant toil for their bare subsistence the load was too heavy for the white men especially men who had not been seasoned to the country The consequence of which was that the greatest part of their time all the heat of the day was spent in idleness which brought certain want along with it It is true that all our colonies on the continent even Virginia and Carolina were originally settled without the help of negroes The white men were obliged to the labour and they underwent it because they then saw no other way but it is the nature of man not to submit to extraordinary hardships in one spot when they see their neighbours on another without any difference in the circumstances of things in a much more easy condition Besides there were no methods taken to animate them under the hardships they endured All things contributed to dispirit them  A levelling scheme in a new colony is a thing extremely unadviseable Men are seldom induced to leave their country but upon some extraordinary prospects there ought always to be something of a vastness in the view that is presented to them to  strike powerfully upon their imagination and this will operate because men will never reason well enough to see that the majority of mankind are not endued with dispositions proper to make a fortune any where let the proposed advantages be what they will The majority of mankind must always be indigent but in a new settlement they must be all so unless some persons there are on such a comfortable and substantial footing as to give direction and vigour to the industry of the rest for in every well contrived building there must be strong beams and joists as well as smaller bricks tiles and laths Persons of substance found themselves discouraged from attempting a settlement by the narrow bounds which no industry could enable them to pass and the design of confirming the inheritance to the male line was an additional discouragement The settlers found themselves not upon a par with the other colonies There was an obvious inconvenience in leaving no provision at all for females as in a new colony the land must be for some time at least the only wealth of the family The quantity of twentyfive acres was undoubtedly too small a portion as it was given without any consideration of the quality of the land and was therefore in many places of very little value Add to this that it was clogged after a short free tenure with a much greater  quitrent than is paid in our best and longest settled colonies Indeed through the whole manner of granting land there appeared I know not what low attention to the trifling profits that might be derived to the trustees or the crown by rents and escheats which clogged the liberal scheme that was first laid down and was in itself extremely injudicious When you have a flourishing colony with extensive settlements from the smallest quitrents the crown receives a large revenue but in an illsettled province the greatest rents make but a poor return and yet are sufficient to burthen and impoverish the people  The tail male grants were so grievous that the trustees themselves corrected that error in a short time The prohibition of rum though specious in appearance had a very bad effect The waters in this unsettled country running through such an extent of forest were not wholsome drinking and wanted the corrective of a little spirit as the settlers themselves wanted something to support their strength in the extraordinary and unusual heat of the climate and the dampness of it in several places disposing them to agues and fevers But what was worse this prohibition in a manner deprived them of the only vent they had for the only commodities they could send to market lumber and corn which could sell no where but in the sugar islands and with this restriction  of negroes and rum they could take very little from them in return  CHAP XXVI  ALL these and several other inconveniencies in the plan of the settlement raised a general discontent in the inhabitants they quarrelled with one another and with their magistrates they complained they remonstrated and finding no satisfaction many of them fled out of Georgia and dispersed themselves where they deemed the encouragement better to all the other colonies So that of above two thousand people who had transported themselves from Europe in a little time not above six or seven hundred were to be found in Georgia so far were they from increasing The mischief grew worse and worse every day until the government revoked the grant to the trustees took the province into their own hands and annulled all the particular regulations that were made It was then left exactly on the same footing with Carolina  Though this step has probably saved the colony from entire ruin yet it was not perhaps so well done to neglect entirely the first views upon which it was settled These were undoubtedly judicious and if the methods taken to compass them were not so well directed  it was no argument against the designs themselves but a reason for some change in the instruments designed to put them in execution Certainly nothing wants a regulation more than the dangerous inequality in the number of negroes and whites in such of our provinces where the former are used South Carolina in spite of it's great wealth is really in a more defenceless condition than a knot of poor townships on the frontiers of New England In Georgia the first error of absolutely prohibiting the use of negroes might be turned to very good account for they would have received the permission to employ them under what qualifications soever not as a restriction but as a favour and indulgence and by executing whatever regulations we should make in this point with strictness by degrees we might see a province fit to answer all the ends of defence and traffic too whereas we have let them use such a latitude in that affair which we were so earnest to prevent that Georgia instead of being any defence to Carolina does actually stand in need of a considerable force to defend itself  As for the scheme of vines and silk we were extremely eager in this respect in the beginning and very supine ever since At that time such a design was clearly impracticable because a few people seated in a wild country must first provide every thing for the  support of life by raising of corn and breeding of cattle before they can think of manufactures of any kind and they must grow numerous enough to spare a number of hands from that most necessary employment before they can lend such things in any degree of cheapness or plenty to a good market But now there is little said of either of these articles though the province is longer settled and grown more populous But the misfortune is that though no people upon earth originally conceive things better than the English do they want the unremitting perseverance which is necessary to bring designs of consequence to perfection We are apt suddenly to change our measures upon any failure without sufficiently considering whether the failure has been owing to a fault in the scheme itself this does not arise from any defect peculiar to our people for it is the fault of mankind in general if left to themselves What is done by us is generally done by the spirit of the people as far as that can go we advance but no farther We want political regulations and a steady plan in government to remedy the defects that must be in all things which depend merely on the character and disposition of the people  At present Georgia is beginning to emerge though slowly out of the difficulties that attended it's first establishment It is still but indifferently  peopled though it is now twentyfour years since it's first settlement Not one of our colonies was of so slow a growth though none had so much of the attention of the government or of the people in general or raised so great expectations in the beginning They export some corn and lumber to the WestIndies they raise some rice and of late are going with success into indigo It is not not to be doubted but in time when their internal divisions are a little better composed the remaining errors in the government corrected and the people begin to multiply that they will become a useful province  Georgia has two towns already known in trade Savannah the capital which stands very well for business about ten miles from the sea upon a noble river of the same name which is navigable two hundred miles further for large boats to the second town called Augusta this stands upon a spot of ground of the greatest fertility and is so commodiously situated for the Indian trade that from the first establishment of the colony it has been in a very flourishing condition and maintained very early six hundred whites in that trade alone The Indian nations on their borders are the upper and lower Creeks the Chickesaws and the Cherokees who are some of the most numerous and powerful tribes in America The trade of skins with this people is the largest  we have it takes in that of Georgia the two Carolinas and Virginia We deal with them somewhat in furs likewise but they are of an inferior sort All species of animals that bear the fur by a wise providence have it more thick and of a softer and finer kind as you go to the northward the greater the cold the better they are clad  CHAP XXVII NOVA SCOTIA  THE last province we have settled or rather began to settle upon the continent of North America is Nova Scotia This vast province called by the French Acadie has New England and the Atlantic ocean to the South and SouthWest and the river and gulph of St Laurence to the North and NorthEast It lies between the th and th degrees of North latitude and though in a very favourable part of the temperate zone has a winter of an almost insupportable length and coldness continuing at least seven months in the year to this immediately succeeds without the intervention of any thing that may be called spring a summer of an heat as violent as the cold though of no long continuance and they are wrapt in the gloom of a perpetual fog even long after  the summer season has commenced In most parts the soil is thin and barren the corn it produces of a shrivelled kind like rye and the grass intermixed with a cold spungy moss However it is not uniformly bad there are tracts in Nova Scotia which do not yield to the best land in New England  Unpromising as this country is yet neglecting all those delightful tracts to the Southward it was here that some of the first European settlements were made The French seated themselves here before they made any establishment in Canada but whatever unaccountable ignorance influenced their choice the industry and vigour of that time deserves our applause for though they had infinitely more difficulties to struggle with than we have at this day and not the hundreth part of the succours from Europe yet they subsisted in a tolerable manner and increased largely when the colony which in our days we have fixed there if the support of the royal hand was withdrawn but for a moment after all the immense sums which have been expended in it's establishment would undoubtedly sink into nothing It is with difficulty it subsists even encouraged and supported as it is Yet the design of establishing a colony here with whatever difficulties it might have been attended was a very prudent measure for the French would undoubtedly have profited of  our neglects and have by some means got this country into their hands to the great annoyance of all our colonies and to the great benefit both of their fishery and their sugar islands  This country has frequently changed hands from one private proprietor to the other and from the French to the English nation backward and forward until the treaty of Utrecht established our right in it finally as the treaty of Aix la Chapelle confirmed it But both were deficient in not ascertaining distinctly what bounds this province ought to have This was left to be adjusted by commissaries Whilst they were debating the French built forts and secured such a part of the province as they were resolved to hold I have not throughout this work chosen to enter into territorial disputes because they convey very little private instruction and do nothing at all towards the establishment of the public rights yet it is difficult to avoid remarking that the line which the French have drawn in Nova Scotia is not only not drawn by any treaty but that it is very apparently calculated to secure them these parts of the province which they value most and at the same time to pay an apparent respect to the treaty of Utrecht by leaving us some part of Acadia  The chief town we had formerly in this province was called Annapolis Royal but  though the capital it was a small place wretchedly fortified and yet worse built and inhabited Here were stationed the remains of a regiment which continued there very little recruited since the reign of queen Anne but though this place never flourished it stood upon the very best harbour as it is said in North America but it was not here but on the SouthEast side of the peninsula that the settlement which was resolved and executed with so much spirit at the end of the last war was planned This too stands upon a fine harbour very commodiously situated and rather better than Annapolis for the fishery The town is called Halifax from the present earl to whose wisdom and care we owe this settlement In three thousand families at an immense charge to the government were transported into this country at once and I think three regiments stationed there to protect them from the Indians who have always shewed themselves our most implacable enemies The town is large and for so new a settlement well built It has a good intrenchment of timber strengthened with forts of the same materials so as to be in little danger at least from an Indian enemy  Though this town of Halifax has all things considered a very flourishing appearance the adjacent country is not improved in proportion the ground is very hard to be cleared  when cleared does not produce a great deal and labour is extravagantly dear But this colony has suffered more from the incursions of the Indians than from any thing else Their incursions have been so frequent and attended with such cruelties that the people can hardly extend themselves beyond the cannon of the fort nor attend their works of agriculture even there without the greatest danger The consequence of this is that they do not raise the fifth part of what is sufficient to maintain them Most of their provision of every sort comes from New England and they must have starved if it were not for the fishery which it must be owned is not contemptible and for some little naval stores and the pay of the garrison the spending of which here is the principal use of the troops against the Indian enemy they are of very little effect though there are three regiments and all the fighting men the Indians can raise in that province are not five hundred The soldiers inactive by their confinement in their barracks diseased for the most part with the scurvy and debilitated by the use of spirituous liquors are quite an undermatch for the activity vigilance patience and address of the American A company of wood rangers kept constantly to scour the country near our settlements and a small body of Indians who might be brought at an easy rate from the friendly tribes who  inhabit our other settlements and encouraged by a reward for what scalps they should bring home sent to infest the enemy amongst their own habitations would have protected our colony and long ago exterminated the Indians or reduced them to an useful subjection since unfortunately we have not the secret of gaining their affections The easy plan I have mentioned would not have had half the expence attending it that the maintenance of a numerous and almost useless garrison has had A little experience will shew to the most ordinary understandings what hardly any sagacity could have without it unveiled to the most penetrating statesman It was a want of this experience that caused another mistake of almost as bad a nature Until the beginning of this war a number of the ancient French colony some say ten or twelve thousand souls remained in the country and were called and treated in a manner as a neutral people though they ought to have been the king's subjects but they yielded very little obedience to the crown of England as in truth they had from us very little protection and they were even accused of encouraging the Indian incursions and supplying them with arms and ammunition to annoy our people Had we erected in their country a little fort and in it kept a small garrison to be maintained by that people themselves appointed magistrates and made  them know the benefit and excellency of the British laws and at the same time impressed them with a dread of the British power we might have saved many useful people to this colony and prevented the necessity if it was a necessity of using measures which if they are not impolitic are certainly such as an humane and generous mind is never constrained to but with regret  Besides Annapolis and Halifax we have another settlement a little to the SouthWest of the latter called Lunenburg This is a branch of Germans from Halifax who being discontented at the infertility of the soil there desired to go where there was better land to be had undertaking their own defence accordingly they settled where they desired to the number of seven or eight hundred and succeed tolerable well Upon a tumult which arose amongst them the governor sent a party of soldiers to protect them from their own discords and from the enemy This province is yet but in it's beginning and therefore except in prospect can afford us no great subject matter of speculation  CHAP XXVIII Newfoundland the Bermudas and the Bahamas  TO the East of this province lies the great isle of Newfoundland above three hundred miles long and two hundred broad extending quite up to New Britain and forming the Eastern boundary of the gulph of St Laurence This island after various disputes about the property was entirely ceded to England by the treaty of Utrecht From the soil of this island we were far from reaping any sudden or great advantage for the cold is long continued and intense and the summer heat though violent warms it not enough to produce any thing valuable for the soil at least in those parts of the island with which we are acquainted for we are far from knowing the whole is rocky and barren However it hath many large and safe harbours and several good rivers water it This island whenever the continent shall come to fail of timber convenient to navigation which perhaps is no very remote prospect will afford a copious supply for masts yards and all sorts of lumber for the WestIndia trade But what at present it is chiefly valuable for is the great fishery of cod which is carried on upon those shoals which are called the banks  of Newfoundland In that the French and Spaniards especially the former have a large share Our share of this fishery is computed to increase the national stock by three hundred thousand a year in gold and silver remitted us for the cod we sell in the North in Spain Portugal Italy and the Levant The plenty of cod both on the great bank and the lesser ones which lie to the East and South East of this island is inconceivable and not only cod but several other species of fish are there in abundance all these species are nearly in an equal plenty all along the shores of New England Nova Scotia and the isle of Cape Breton and consequently excellent fisheries are carried on upon all their coasts Where our American colonies are so ill peopled or so barren as not to produce any thing from their soil their coasts make us ample amends and pour in upon us a wealth of another kind and no way inferior to the former from their fisheries  We have in North America besides this two clusters of islands the Bermudas or Summer islands at a vast distance from the continent in lat and the Bahama islands The former were very early settled and were much celebrated in the time of the civil wars when several of the cavalier party being obliged to retire into America some of them in particular Mr Waller the poet spent some  time in this island Waller was extremely enamoured with the serenity of the air and the beauty and richness of the vegetable productions of these islands he celebrated them in a poem which is fine but unequal which he wrote upon this subject  The Bermudas are but small not containing in all upwards of twenty thousand acres They are very difficult of access being as Waller expresses it walled with rocks What has been said of the clearness and serenity of the air and of the healthiness of the climate was not exaggerated but the soil could never boast of an extraordinary fertility Their best production was cedar which was superior to any thing of the kind in America It is still so though diminished considerably in quantity which has as it is imagined changed the air much for the worse for now it is much more inconstant than formerly and several tender vegetables which flourished here at the first settlement being deprived of their shelter and exposed to the bleak Northerly winds are seen no more  The chief and indeed only business of these islanders is the building and navigating light sloops and brigantines built with their cedar which they employ chiefly in the trade between North America and the WestIndies These vessels are as remarkable for their swiftness as the wood of which they are built is  for it's hard and durable quality They export nothing from themselves but some white stone to the West Indies and some of their garden productions To England they send nothing Formerly they made a good deal of money of a sort of hats for womens wear of the leaves of their palmetto's which whilst the fashion lasted were elegant but the trade and the fashion are gone together  Their whites are computed to be about five thousand the blacks which they breed are the best in America and as useful as the whites in their navigation The people of the Bermudas are poor but healthy contented and remarkably cheerful It is extremely surprising that they do not set themselves heartily to the cultivation of vines in this island to which their rocky soil seems admirably adapted and their situation and the manner of trade they are already engaged in would facilitate the distribution of their wine to every part of North America and the WestIndies  The Bahamas are situated to the South of Carolina from lat to and they extend along the coast of Florida quite down to the isle of Cuba and are said to be five hundred in number some of them only mere rocks but a great many others large fertile and in nothing differing from the soil of Carolina All are however absolutely uninhabited except Providence which is neither the largest nor the most fertile  This island was formerly a receptacle for those pirates who for a long time infested the American navigation This obliged the government to erect a fort there to station an independent company in the island and to send thither a governor This island has at present not much trade some oranges it sends to North America excepted However in time of war it makes considerably by the prizes condemned here and in time of peace by the wrecks which are frequent in this labyrinth of innumerable rocks and shelves This is all the benefit we derive from so many large and fertile islands situated in such a climate as will produce any thing and which as it is never reached by any frosts would yield in all probability even sugars of as good a sort and in as great abundance as any islands in the WestIndies Nothing more fully shews the present want of that spirit of adventure and enterprize which was so common in the two last centuries and which is of such infinite honour and advantage to any time or nation than that these islands so situated can lie unoccupied whilst we complain of the want of land proper for sugar and whilst an hundred pounds an acre is paid for such in the Caribbees  CHAP XXIX HUDSON's BAY  THE countries about Hudson's and Baffin's Bay make the last object of our speculation in America The knowledge of these seas was owing to a project for the discovery of a NorthWest passage to China So early as the year this noble design was conceived since then it has been frequently dropped it has often been revived it is not yet compleated but was never despaired of by those whose knowledge and spirit make them competent judges and lovers of such undertakings Frobisher only discovered the main of New Britain or Terra de Labrador and those streights to which he has given his name In John David sailed from Dartmouth and viewed that and the more Northerly coasts but he seems never to have entered the bay Hudson made three voyages on the same adventure the first in the second in and his third and last in This bold and judicious navigator entered the streights that led into this new Mediterranean coasted a great part of it and penetrated to eighty degrees twentythree minutes into the heart of the frozen zone His ardor for the discovery not abated by the difficulties he struggled with in this empire of  winter and world of frost and snow he staid here until the ensuing spring and prepared in the beginning of to pursue his discoveries but his crew who suffered equal hardships without the same spirit to support them mutinied seized upon him and seven of those who were most faithful to him and commited them to the fury of the seas in an open boat Hudson and his companions were either swallowed up by the waves or gaining the unhospitable coast which they water were destroyed by the savages but his fate so calamitous cannot so much discourage a generous mind from such undertakings as the immortality of his name which he has secured by having given it to so great a sea will be a spur to others to expect an equal honour and perhaps with better success  From the first voyage of Frobisher an hundred and eight years ago to that of captain Ellis notwithstanding so many disappointments the rational hopes of this grand discovery have grown greater by every attempt and seem to spring even out of our very failures The greater swell of the tides in the inner part of the bay than near the streights an appearance so unknown in any other inland seas and the increase of this swell with Westerly winds seems without any other arguments to evince the certain existence of such a passage as we have so long sought  without success But though we have hitherto failed in the original purpose for which we navigated this bay yet such great designs even in their failures bestow a sufficient reward for whatever has been expended upon them In the charter was granted to a company for the exclusive trade to this bay and they have acted under it ever since with great benefit to the private men who compose the company though comparatively with little advantage to Great Britain It is true that their trade in beavers and other species of furs is not inconsiderable and it is a trade in itself of the best kind it's object enters largely into our manufactures and carries nothing but our manufactures from us to procure it and thus it has the qualities of the most advantageous kinds of traffic The company has besides pretty large returns in deer skins It is said that the dividends of this company are prodigious far exceeding what is gained in any of the other great trading bodies yet their capital is small they seem little inclined to enlarge their bottom and appear strongly possessed with that spirit of jealousy that prevails in some degree in all knots and societies of men endued with peculiar privileges The officers of the company have behaved to those who wintered within their jurisdiction in search of the NorthWest passage one of the purposes for which the company itself was  originally instituted in such a manner as to give us the truest idea of this spirit If I had been singular in this opinion I should have expressed my sentiments with much greater diffidence but this abuse has been often and loudly complained of It would appear astonishing that this trade has not hitherto been laid open if in the perplexing multiplicity of affairs that engages our ministry something must not necessarily pass unredressed  The vast countries which surround this bay all abound with animals whose fur is excellent and some of kinds which are not yet brought into commerce and the company is very far from any attempt to stretch this trade to it's full extent If the trade were laid open it seems of necessity that three capital advantages would ensue first that the trade going into a number of rival hands with a more moderate profit to individuals it would consume a much greater quantity of our manufactures employ more of our shipping and seamen and of course bring home more furs and by lowering the price of that commodity at home increase the demand of those manufactures into which they enter at the foreign markets it might bring home other species of furs than those we deal in at present and thus open new channels of trade which in commerce is a matter of great consideration Secondly this more general intercourse would  make the country better known it would habituate great numbers of our people to it it would discover the most tolerable parts for a settlement and thus instead of a miserable fort or two time might shew an English colony at Hudson's Bay which would open the fur trade yet more fully and increase the vent of our manufactures yet further Thirdly this more general trade on the bay would naturally without any new expence or trouble whatsoever in a very short space of time discover to us the so much desired NorthWest passage or shew us clearly and definitively that we ought to expect no such thing These advantages and even yet more considerable ones would be derived from laying open this trade under such proper regulations which the nature of the object would point out of itself  No colony has been hitherto attempted at Hudson's Bay The company has two inconsiderable forts there The country is every where barren to the Northward of the bay even the hardy pine tree is seen no longer and the cold womb of the earth is incapable of any better production than some miserable shrubs The winter reigns with an inconceiveable rigour for near nine months of the year the other three are violently hot except when the NorthWest wind renews the memory of the winter Every kind of European seed which we have committed to  the earth in this inhospitable climate has hi+therto perished but in all probability we have not tried the seed of corn from the Northern parts of Sweden and Norway in such cases the place from whence the seed comes is of great moment All this severity and long continuance of winter and the barrenness of the earth which arises from thence is experienced in the latitude of in the temperate latitude of Cambridge However it is far from increasing uniformly as you go Northward Captain James wintered in Charlton island in latitude he judged that the climate here was to be deemed utterly uninhabitable on account of the surprising hardships which he suffered yet the company has a fort several degrees more to the Northward where their servants make a shift to subsist tolerably It is called Fort Nelson and is in the latitude  All the animals of these countries are cloathed with a close soft warm fur In summer there is here as in other places a variety in the colours of the several animals when that is over they all assume the livery of winter and every sort of beasts and most of their fowls are of the colour of the snow every thing animate and inanimate is white This is a surprising phenomenon But what is yet more surprising and what is indeed one of these striking things that draw the most inattentive to an admiration of the wisdom and goodness  of Providence is that the dogs and cats from England that have been carried into Hudson's bay on the approach of winter have intirely changed their appearance and acquired a much longer softer and thicker coat of hair than they had originally As for the men of the country Providence there as as every where else has given them no provision but their own art and ingenuity and they shew a great deal in their manner of kindling fire in cloathing themselves and in preserving their eyes from the ill effects of that glaring white that every where surrounds them for the greatest part of the year in other respects they are very savage In their shapes and faces they do not resemble the Americans who live to the Southward they are much more like the Laplanders and Samoeids of Europe from whom they are probably descended The other Americans seem to be of a Tartar original  I have now finished upon my plan the survey of the English colonies in America I flatter myself that so full an idea has not been given of them before in so narrow a compass By this the reader will himself be enabled to judge for it is not my design to preoccupy his judgment in these particulars how our colonies have grown what their vegetative principle has been in what vigour it subsists or what signs of corruption appear in any of them how far  we have pursued the advantages which our situation and the nature of the country have given us or where we have pursued them whether we have gone to the ultimate point He will see how far the colonies have served the trade of the mother country and how much the mother country has done or neglected to do towards their happiness and prosperity Certainly our colonies deserve and would fully reward an attention of a very different kind from any that was ever yet paid to them Even as they are circumstanced I do not in the least hesitate to say that we derive more advantage and of a better kind from our colonies than the Spaniards and Portuguese have from theirs abounding as they are with gold and silver and precious stones whereas in ours there is no appearance at all of such dazzling and delusive wealth But then I conceive it might be made very clear that had they yielded us these splendid metals in lieu of what they now produce the effect would be far less to our advantage Our present intercourse with them is an emulation in industry they have nothing that does not arise from theirs and what we receive enters into our manufactures excites our industry and increases our commerce whereas gold is the measure or account but not the means of trade And it is found in nations as it is in the fortunes of private men that what does not arise from labour but is  acquired by other means is never lasting Such acquisitions extinguish industry which is alone the parent of any solid riches  The barbarism of our ancestors could not comprehend how a nation could grow more populous by sending out a part of it's people We have lived to see this paradox made out by experience but we have not sufficiently profited of this experience since we begin some of us at least to think that there is a danger of dispeopling ourselves by encouraging new colonies or increasing the old If our colonies find as hitherto they have constantly done employment for a great number of hands there is no danger but that hands will be found for the employment That a rich trading and manufacturing nation should be long in want of people is a most absurd supposition for besides that the people within themselves multiply the most where the means of subsistence are most certain it is as natural for people to flock into a busy and wealthy country that by any accident may be thin of people as it is for the dense air to rush into those parts where it is rarified He must be a great stranger to this country who does not observe in it a vast number of people whose removal from hence if they could be of any use elsewhere would prove of very little detriment to the public  I have already observed that the trade of our colonies deserves a more particular attention than any other not only on account of the advantages I have just mentioned but because our attention is sure of being sufficiently rewarded The object is in our own power it is of a good kind and of such extent and variety as to employ nobly the most inventive genius in those matters Foreign politics have something more splendid and entertaining than domestic prudence but this latter is ever attended though with less glaring yet with infinitely more solid secure and lasting advantages The great point of our regard in America ought therefore to be the effectual peopling employment and strength of our possessions there in a subordinate degree the management of our interests with regard to the French and Spaniards The latter we have reason to respect to indulge and even perhaps to endure and more it is probable may be had from them in that way than by the violent methods which some have so warmly recommended and still urge tho' we have had some experience to convince us of their insufficiency But the nature of the French their situation their designs every thing has shewn that we ought to use every method to repress them to prevent them from extending their territories their trade or their influence and above all to connive at not the least encroachment but  this in such a manner as not to strain our own strength or turn our eyes from serving ourselves by attempts to distress them But as we are now in the midst of a war until that is decided it will be impossible to say any thing satisfactory on our connections with French America until we see what the next treaty of peace will do in the distribution of the territory of the two nations there  CHAP XXX The Government of the English Colonies and the Paper Currency  THE settlement of our colonies was never pursued upon any regular plan but they were formed grew and flourished as accidents the nature of the climate or the dispositions of private men happened to operate We ought not therefore to be surprised to find in the several constitutions and governments of our colonies so little of any thing like uniformity It has been said that there is scarce any form of government known that does not prevail in some of our plantations the variety is certainly great and vicious but the latitude of the observation must be somewhat restrained for some forms they are certainly strangers to To pass over several nothing like  a pure hereditary aristocracy has ever appeared in any of them  The first colony which we settled was that of Virginia It was governed for some time by a president and a council appointed by the crown but when the people were increased to a considerable body it was not thought reasonable to leave them longer under a mode of government so averse from that which they had enjoyed at home They were therefore empowered to elect representatives for the several counties into which this province is divided with privileges resembling those of the representatives of the commons in England The persons so elected form what is called the lower house of assembly This was added to the council which still subsisted and the members of which were and to this day are nominated by the crown as at the first and they are not only nominated by the crown but hold their seats during the king's pleasure as signified by his governor They are stiled honourable and are chosen from the persons of the best fortunes and most considerable influence in the country They form another branch of the legislature and are sometimes called the upper house of assembly They answer in some measure to the house of peers in our constitution As the lower house of assembly is the guardian of the peoples privileges the council is appointed chiefly to preserve the prerogative  of the crown and to secure the dependence of the colony it is the more effectually to answer these ends that the members of the council are only appointed during pleasure  When any bill has passed the two houses it comes before the governor who represents the king and gives his assent or negative as he thinks proper It now acquires the force of a law but it must be afterwards transmited to the king and council in England where it may still receive a negative that takes away all it's effect The upper house of assembly not only forms a part of the legislature of the colony but it acts as a privy council to the governor without whose concurrence he can do nothing of moment it sometimes acts as a court of chancery This is the common form of government and the best too that is in use in the plantations This is the manner of government in all the islands of the WestIndies in Nova Scotia in one province of New England and with some restrictions in another in New York New Jersey Virginia the two Carolinas and Georgia This form is commonly called a royal government  The second form in use in our settlements in America is called a proprietary government At our first planting that part of the world it was not difficult for a person who had interest at court to obtain large tracts of  land not inferior in extent to many kingdoms and to be invested with a power very little less than regal over them to govern by what laws and to form what sort of constitution he pleased A dependence upon the crown of England was shewn only by the payment of an Indian arrow a few skins or some other trifling acknowledgment of the same nature We had formerly many more governments of that sort than we have at present in the WestIndies the island of Barbadoes was granted to the earl of Carlisle and we have seen a like grant made of the island of St Lucia to the duke of Montague in this age which after an infinite charge to that benevolent nobleman came to nothing by a sort of tacit allowance of the French claim to it This was in when our connection with France hindered us from exerting our rights with the necessary vigour Carolina was formerly a government of this kind but it was lodged in eight proprietaries How they parted with their rights we have seen already New Jersey was likewise a proprietary government but this too failed like the others The only governments in this form which remain at present but considerably abridged of their privileges are Pensylvania and Maryland In the latter the constitution exactly resembles that of the royal governments a governor council and assembly of the representatives  of the people but the governor is appointed by the proprietary and approved by the crown The customs are reserved to the crown likewise and the officers belonging to them are independent of the government of the province In Pensylvania the proprietary is under the same restrictions that limit the proprietary of Maryland on the side of the crown on the side of the people he is yet more restrained for their legislature has but two parts the assembly of the people and the governor so that the governor wanting the great influence which the council gives in other places whenever his sentiments differ from those of the assembly he is engaged in a very unequal contest  The third form is called a charter government this originally prevailed in all the provinces of New England and still remains in two of them Connecticut and Rhode Island By the charters to these colonies the exorbitant power which was given in the proprietary governments to single men was here vested and I apprehend much more dangerously in the whole body of the people It is to all purposes a mere democracy They elect every one of their own officers from the highest to the lowest they displace them at pleasure and the laws which they enact are valid without the royal approbation This state of unbounded freedom I believe contributed in  some degree to make those settlements flourish but it certainly contributed as much to render their value to their mother country far more precarious than a better digested plan would have done that might have taken in the interests both of Great Britain and of the new settlement The truth is nothing of an enlarged and legislative spirit appears in the planning of our colonies the charter governments were evidently copied from some of our corporations at home which if they are good institutions themselves yet are by no means fit to be imitated by a new people going into a remote country far from the eye and hand of the supreme power What may be an useful institution for an inferior member of some great body and closely united to it may be not at all proper for a new settlement which is to form a sort of dependent commonwealth in a remote part of the world Here the ends to be answered are to make the new establishment as useful as possible to the trade of the mother country to secure it's dependence to provide for the ease safety and happiness of the settlers to protect them from their enemies and to make an easy and effectual provision to preserve them from the tyranny and avarice of their governors or the ill consequences of their own licentiousness that they should not by growing into an unbounded liberty forget that  they were subjects or lying under a base servitude have no reason to think themselves British subjects This is all that colonies according to the present and best ideas of them can or ought to be The charter governments had nothing of this in view and consequently provided for it but very indifferently  The province of Massachusets bay which is partly a government of this popular kind but tempered with something more of the royal authority seems to be on still a worse footing through the one error of having no established provision for the governor this one mischief is productive of a thousand others because the governor in a manner is obliged to keep intrigues and devices on foot to reconcile the various parts which he must act and is necessitated to govern by faction and cabal Hence it is that the charges of this one government are greater than those not only of the other provinces of New England taken together but of those of Pensylvania and New York added to them they are deeply in debt they are every day plunging deeper their taxes increase and their trade declines  It has been an old complaint that it is not easy to bring American governors to justice for mismanagements in their province or to make them refund to the injured people the wealth raised by their extortions Against such  governors at present there are three kinds of remedy the privy council the king's bench and the parliament The council on just cause of complaint may remove the governor the power of the council seems to extend no further The king's bench may punish the governors for their offences committed in America as if done in England The power of parliament is unlimited in the ways of enquiry into the crime or of punishing it The first of these remedies can never be sufficient to terrify a governor grown rich by iniquity and willing to retire quietly though dishonourably to enjoy the fruits of it The king's bench or any other merely law court seems equally insufficient for this purpose because offences in government though very grievous can hardly ever be so accurately defined as to be a proper object of any court of justice bound up by forms and the rigid letter of the law The parliament is equal to every thing but whether party and other bars to a quick and effectual proceeding may not here leave the provinces as much unredressed as in the other courts I shall not take upon me to determine  The law in all our provinces besides those acts which from time to time they have made for themselves is the common law of England the old statute law and a great part of the new which in looking over their laws I find many of our settlements have adopted with  very little choice or discretion And indeed the laws of England if in the long period of their duration they have had many improvements so they have grown more tedious perplexed and intricate by the heaping up many abuses in one age and the attempts to remove them in another These infant settlements surely demanded a more simple clear and determinate legislation though it were of somewhat an homelier kind laws suited to the time to their country and the nature of their new way of life Many things still subsist in the law of England which are built upon causes and reasons that have long ago ceased many things are in those laws suitable to England only But the whole weight of this ill agreeing mass which neither we nor our fathers were hardly able to bear is laid upon the shoulders of these colonies by which a spirit of contention is raised and arms offensive and defensive supplied to keep up and exercise this spirit by the intricacy and unsuitableness of the laws to their object And thus in many of our settlements the lawyers have gathered to themselves the greatest part of the wealth of the country men of less use in such establishments than in more settled countries where the number of people naturally sets many apart from the occupations of husbandry arts or commerce Certainly our American brethren might well have carried with them the privileges which make  the glory and happiness of Englishmen without taking them encumbered with all that load of matter perhaps so useless at home certainly so extremely prejudicial in the colonies  Laws themselves are hardly more the cement of societies than money and societies flourish or decay according to the condition of either of these It may be easily judged that as the ballance of trade with Great Britain is very much against the colonies that therefore whatever gold or silver they may receive from the other branches of their commerce makes but a short stay in America This consideration at first view would lead one to conclude that in a little time money for their ordinary circulation would be wanting and this is apparently confirmed by experience Very little money is seen amongst them notwithstanding the vast increase of their trade This deficiency is supplied or more properly speaking it is caused by the use of money of credit which they commonly call paper currency This money is not created for the conveniency of traffic but by the exigencies of the government and often by the frauds and artifices of private men for their particular profit Before this invention money was indeed scarce enough in America but they raised it's value and it served their purpose tolerably I shall forbear entering into the causes that increased the charges of government so greatly in all our  American provinces But the execution of projects too vast for their strength made large sums necessary The feeble state of a colony which had hardly taken root in the country could not bear them and to raise sudden and heavy taxes would destroy the province without answering their purpose Credit then came in aid of money and the government issued bills to the amount of what they wanted to pass current in all payments and they commonly laid a tax or found some persons willing to engage their lands as security for the gradual sinking this debt and calling in these bills But before the time arrived at which these taxes were to answer their end new exigencies made new emissions of paper currency necessary and thus things went from debt to debt until it became very visible that no taxes which could be imposed could discharge them and that the landed securities given were often fraudulent and almost always insufficient Then the paper currency became no longer to be weighed against the credit of the government which depended upon it's visible revenue It was compared to the trade to which it was found so disproportionate that the bills fell ten twenty fifty and eighty per cent in some places It was to no purpose that the government used every method to keep up their credit and even to compel the receiving these bills at the value for which they  were emitted and to give no preference over them to gold and silver they were more and more depreciated every day whilst the government every day emitted more paper and grew less sollicitous about their old bills being entirely exhausted to find means of giving credit to the new  It is easy to perceive how much the intercourse of business must suffer by this uncertainty in the value of money when a man receives that in payment this day for ten shillings which tomorrow he will not find received from him for five or perhaps for three Real money can hardly ever multiply too much in any country because it will always as it increases be the certain sign of the increase of trade of which it is the measure and consequently of the soundness and vigour of the whole body But this paper money may and does increase without any increase of trade nay often when it greatly declines for it is not the measure of the trade of the nation but of the necessity of it's government and it is absurd and must be ruinous that the same cause which naturally exhausts the wealth of a nation should likewise be the only productive cause of money  The currency of our plantations must not be set upon a level with the funds in England For besides that the currency carries no interest to make some amends for the badness of  the security the security itself is so rotten that no art can give it any lasting credit as there are parts of New England wherein if the whole stock and the people along with it were sold they would not bring money enough to take in all the bills which have been emitted  I hope it is not too late to contrive some remedy for this evil as those at the head of affairs here are undoubtedly very sollicitous about so material a grievance I should imagine that one current coin for the whole continent might be struck here or there with such an allay as might at once leave it of some real value and yet so debased as to prevent it's currency elsewhere and so to keep it within themselves This expedient has been practised and with success in several parts of Europe but particularly in Holland a country which undoubtedly is perfectly acquainted with it's commercial interest  THE CONTENTS Of the FIRST VOLUME  PART I  CHAP I
