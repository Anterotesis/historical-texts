 in  PaternosterRow    CAMILLUS A POEM Humbly Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of  Peterborough  and  Monmouth  WHEN Injur'd Heroes suffer in their Fame  Justice unsummon'd shou'd their Wrongs proclaim  Apollo  's Sons shou'd raise Resentment high'r  And flame in Raptures of Poetick Fire  Since where Injustice clouds a Noble Name  The Poet suffers in the Patron's Shame  Permit Great Sir my humble Muse to raise  A grateful Monument to Crown your Praise  Unbend your mighty Soul and stoop to Fame  Whose Voice shall sound to Heav'n your glorious Name  Minds that are Great like Y  urs disdain Applause  Their inborn Vertue gives their Reason Laws  Above the reach of Malice bless'd they live  Prou'd to be enay'd and like  Heav'n  forgive  Where shall my lab'ring Fancy Numbers find  To sing the shining Glories of thy Mind  Or thro' the lab'rynth of thy Wonders wind  How dares my artless Pen attempt a Verse  Worthy thy Godlike Actions to reherse  How dares my Muse to Songs of Valour press  Which all alike admire but none can well express  About my Breast tumult'ous Terrors rowl  And rising Passions shake my sickly Soul  Reasons unnumber'd through my Judgment shine  Some urge and some forbid the vast Design  Here  Justice summons  There  my Youth denies  Duty to  This  to  That  my Will replys  Resolv'd at last your safe Return to greet  I throw my worthless Numbers at your Feet  Assur'd the gen'rous Goodness of your Eye  Will see my Will and pass my Errors by  But if my feeble Genius chance to fail  Nor ardent Pray'rs can with the Nine prevail  Think Sir how various your Great Acts appear  There  War and Glory Wit and Honour  Here  One Glitt'ring Moment spreads your wond'rous Fame  Battles and Bloodshed celebrate your Name  Now the great Hero in a Purple Flood  Plunges thro' stormy Seas of hostile Blood  Then Strides with skilful Courage from afar  To stop the Gap of unsuccessful W A R  Another Moment smoothly Guilds his Face  With Female Sweetness and a Lovely Grace  Calmly he Tunes his Mind to soster Sports  And lives the Matchless Parragon of Courts  No wonder then if my presumptuous Eye  Viewing thy Sun of Excellence too nigh  Dazled with Light is forc'd to look awry  Thus when some Traveller who wants a Guide  O'er an extended Plain attempts to ride  Where Num'rous Paths of Equal breadth appear  Till he no longer knows which Course to Steer  If chusing wrong at last he goes astray  What Man wou'd blame him that he lost his way  In Peace the fam'd  HISPANIA  long had slept  And full Possession of her  Indies  kept  Burthen'd with Plenty idle Bliss they knew  Till with their Swords their Natures rusty grew  But now against their Wills they climb to Fate  And hostile Heroes force 'em to be Great  When their late Monarch had resign'd his Breath  And swiftwing'd Fame proclaim'd his mighty Death  The Trumpets Clangors eccho'd from afar  And Friendly Nations rose to sudden War  The hardy Veterans their Arms prepare  And waving Banners fan the Warlike Air  The sprightly Steeds with lofty Bounds advance  And curb'd by skillful Riders proudly prance  A wild Confusion o'er the Globe is hurl'd  And dreadful Earthquakes shake the Christian World  The  AUSTRIAN  Prince Heir by a just Descent  To gain his Right his strong Endeavours bent  BOURBON  oppos'd and in the vacant Throne  Wou'd place a Royal Offspring of his own  The first had Right but Pow'r which all obey  Appear'd to justifie the Second's Sway  The Arms of  France  his false Pretence maintain  And mount their  ANJOU  to the Crown of  Spain  With helpless sighs the Injur'd  AUSTRIAN  stands  And lifts to gracious  Heav'n  his Eyes and Hands  He begs his Justice to a muchwrong'd Man  And  Heav'n  directs his Pray'rs to matchless  ANNE  Thither they fly whom pow'rful Wrongs oppress  And find a certain Shelter from Distress  By her the proud Usurper daily bleeds  And Gazing Monarchs Wonder at her Deeds  In deep Surprize and Silence fix'd they stand  And see the Fate of  Europe  in her Hand  Thither with tow'ring Hopes and longing Eyes  The Young Excluded Monarch swiftly flies  Whispers in  ANNA  's Ears his weighty Grief  And from her Pitty'ng Soul extracts Relief  At her Command the ready  Britains  fly  Exert their inborn Worth and proudly die  Pleas'd with their Fate they gladly sell their Breath  And smile amidst the raging Pangs of Death  A Chosen Band of Men who all things dare  For distant War their mighty Souls prepare  Through ev'ry Ear their Glorious Cause they Ring  To Curb proud  France  and Right an injur'd King  O'er these a  Earl of  Peterborough  Chief by Art and Nature grac'd  Renown'd in War and Policy was plac'd  Beyond the rest his Judgment cou'd discern  And cou'd with ease improve what others cou'd not learn  He ow'd not Virtue to the fear of Shame  Nor practis'd Honesty in Hopes of Fame  In him a spotless Honour firmly stood  Bath'd in the Gen'rous Streams of Noble Blood  Him the Great  ANNA  chose  CAMILLUS  go  Revenge my  Brother  on his haughty Foe  Guard him through Dangers give the Prince his own  And safely lift him to the  Spanish  Throne  The Valiant Chief without Ambition Brave  Humbly Receiv'd the Weighty Charge She gave  Destin'd in spite of Malice to be Great  He Arms his daring Soul to Combate Fate  And now the  British  Gen'rals gladly meet  And lead their Army to the waiting Fleet  With swelling Hopes embark and Joy to find  The brisk Assistance of a willing Wind  In loud Salutes the deepmouth'd Cannons Roar  Answer'd by zealous Wishes from the Shore  Whence mingled Crowds their hearty Pray'rs repeat  Till rising Waves Obscure the sailing Fleet  On the extremest Limits of that Land  Through which the  Tagus  rich in Golden Sand  His Rapid Course in depth of Waters bends  And twice two hundred Miles his Stream extends  Old  BARCELONA  strong by Nature stands  And Rules a vast Extent of fertile Lands  With Rocky Mountains half environ'd round  The other half by Bogs and Marshy Ground  Beneath her Walls surrounding Trenches lie  Above their Banks rise Bulworks vastly high  Walls within Walls the solid Place defend  And watchful Centinels their Charge attend  ngines of hollow Brass with fiery Breath  Vomit black sulph'rous Messages of Death  Charg'd with Destruction speak with horrid Roar  And scatter Terrors round the Neigh'bring Shore  Hither with crowded Sails the  Britains  bent  Big with the Message their Great Mistress sent  Their Warlike Souls to Emulation rise  And breath out pious Wishes to the Skies  And now those Pow'rs which brave Designs attend  Had brought their Voyage to an happy End  From  Barcelona  's Tow'rs with wild Affright  The trembling Foe beholds th' unwelcome Sight  A mighty Fleet approaching by degrees  In graceful Order Ploughs the smiling Seas  Harmonious Musick spreads the Joy they bring  And Clam'rous Shouts proclaim the coming King  The sounding Trumpets his Intent declare  And waving Streamers flourish in the Air  Arriv'd at length the Cannons loudly roar  And shake with panick Fright the wond'ring Shore  Mean while the  Spaniards  all their Force prepare  And Arm confus'dly for defensive War  Blind with Amusement and ignoble Fear  They double all the  BRITAINS  that appear  All think with Horror  England  now had bent  Her utmost Force to form one Grand Descent  But when they saw so small a Number Land  And boldly tread the Surface of their Sand  The paler Marks of Fear forsook their Face  And Wonder far more Great supplies the Place  An equal Force within their Walls they found  Yet fear'd to meet their Foes on equal Ground  They saw with Wonder at an Act so vain  Th' undaunted  Britains  win the Neighb'ring Plain  Where soon their Squadrons form'd a Camp and then  They thought or dreaded they were more than Men  Thus had the great  CAMILLUS  forc'd his Way  And void of Fear in midst of Dangers lay  Impatient of Delays the  Austrian  Youth  Deep touch'd with Sorrow listen'd to the Truth  He saw the Weakness of his daring Few  And with Concern his Foes Advantage knew  The Brazen Tubes of Death were mounted high  And Clouds of rowling Smoak obscur'd the Sky  All this and more from his small Camp was seen  And Death disguis'd with Horror stalk'd between  The Aged Chiefs in cautious War grown old  Wou'd rather be too backward than too bold  Therefore advis'd the Prince to haste away  Since 'twas scarce possible to live and stay  The Prince with melancholy Thoughts opprest  Came to  CAMILLUS  and unlock'd his Breast  the Pangs of Sorrow Shame and Rage  shook the blooming Comforts of his Age  Told him the Flames in which his Soul wou'd burn  Shou'd he thus unsuccessfully Return  With Grief the gen'rous  Britain  heard him tell  The deep Misfortunes he but knew too well  He rowls his Eyes accuses Partial Fate  And tells the  Austrian  that he shou'd be Great  Resolv'd to act the Council speak in vain  And by Debates protract the Fall of  Spain  CAMILLUS  had a Soul whose Heav'nly Fire  Cou'd compass all Things and to all aspire  Himself alone cou'd with himself Debate  And mov'd obscurely like the Hand of Fate  Hard by the Tow'rs of  Barcelona  stands  High on the Rocks o'erlooking Neighb'ring Lands  A strongbuilt Castle whose extended Sway  Obliges ev'n the City to Obey  Five Hundred Men the solid Ramparts keep  On Rocks beyond Imagination steep  Whence rowling Stones invading Foes can Chace  When with an aking Eye they climb the dreadful Place  This was the Source whence Victories must flow  Hither the  British  Chief resolv'd to go  Unus'd to Fear and more unus'd to boast  With temp'rate Words he chear'd his wond'ring Host  Strove not to hide the Hazard of the Task  Nor cover Danger with a guilded Mask  He tells each Soldier what he must perform  And by Example wins 'em to the Storm  The Rosy Morning usher'd in the Sun  Which was to see a bloody Business done  His Beams shon bright to guide the Battle well  And drank their Blood in Pitty as it fell  Eight Hundred  Britains  on this glorious Day  O'er Pathless Forrests force their oblique Way  In tedious March o'er high Assents they past  And won the dang'rous Precipice at last  With strange Surprize the Foe begins to Arm  And Bells rung backward in a loud alarm  The summon'd Soldiers hasten to their Post  And pour whole Vollies on the climbing Host  New Forms of Death huge falling Stones create  And crush invading Numbers with their Weight  Repeated Charges from the Cannons fly  Like fiery Meteors blazing thro' the Sky  The shatter'd Limbs of Men who bravely dare  Are born on Bullets thro' the flaming Air  Adding new Motion to disjointed Parts  The dismal Prospect shocks the bravest Hearts  The brave  CAMILLUS  with a fierce Delight  Guides on the headlong Fury of the Fight  Prompting his bleeding Troops to venture higher  And scatter Death for Death and Fire for Fire  when of old the mighty Giants strove  check the boundless Pow'r of angry Jove  With Force like this but in a Cause less good  The huge  Briareus  bath'd in Streams of Blood  Stands on the Globe attempts to conquer Fate  And shakes the solid Center with his Weight  Kicks at the Thunder which with Horror flies  And while swift Lightning flashes in his Eyes  Tears up a hundred Rocks and throws 'em at the Skies  But now aloft the mingled War grows high  On heaps promiscuous Numbers fall and Die  Rivers of Blood from the mix'd Battle flows  Till Death scarce sees to Guide her destin'd Blows  The Walls are won the  Spaniards  lose the Day  And Valiant  Britains  win the Cover'd Way  Soldiers below by mutual Help ascend  While those above the Conquer'd Pass Defend  No more the driven Foes their Fortune try  But quit their bloody Battlements and fly  Despair and Horror fill the Dismal Place  And Terror sits Enthron'd on ev'ry Face  Destructive Fate grows Cruel to Excess  And rages blindly in her blackest Dress  Matrons and Virgins Weep with bitter Cries  And Noisy Sorrows pierce the distant Skies  But cease mistaken Wretches cease your Moan  And on your bended Knees your Follies own  Tho' haughty  Gauls  will still Tyrannick be  CAMILLUS  Conquers but to set you Free  His Gen'rous Soul no base Intention knows  But Pitties ev'n the Blackest of his Foes  This swift Success confounds the wondring King  And all the Host their Gen'ral's Praises sing  But he with wonted Care proceeds to End  The vast Design such early Joys attend  VVith rich Rewards he chears his Men again  And leads them down with Courage to the Plain  There plants divided Troops on distant Ground  To force a City they not half surround  Thus moves he brightly like some wand'ring Star  And scorns the heavy Arts of Common VVar  His Actions by their Merits brightly blaze  He needs no Council and he seeks no Praise  VVhile other Gen'rals tedious Projects Form  He Thinks and Acts and VVins Applause by Storm  With furious Courage stands and Tempts his Fate  But  Heav'n  still spares the MAN to Bless the STATE  With Threat'ning Look each ready  Britain  stands  And sharpedg'd VVeapons grace their VVarlike Hands  Obsequious Silence waits the Gen'ral's Nod  As Ancient  Grecians  watch'd the  Delphian  God  Mean while each trembling Tow'r with horrid Dread  Loosen'd its Walls and shook its batter'd Head  The lofty VVorks which shou'd the Town defend  The shocks of hostile Thunder widely rend  Amidst these Crowds of Terrors and Despair  The  Britains  for a sharp Assault prepare  The  Spaniards  see and shun their low'ring Fates  And widely open their submissive Gates  And now the mighty Deed is greatly done  A King reliev'd and Kingdoms bravely won  The Warlike Chief with Glory fir'd his Breast  Forgot his Pleasures and forsook his Rest  The  Austrian  fix'd he boldly onward bent  And Conquer'd Rebel Countries as he went  The stubborn  Catalans  unus'd to bow  Gladly submit to firm Subjection now  With joyful Shouts their happy Monarch greet  And leave their Mountains for the Regal Seat  That strongbuilt Fort whose State the rest excell'd  And thrice Ten Thousand  Gallick  Foes repell'd  Afraid to strive her Iron Gates unlock'd  And calmly open'd when  CAMILLUS  knock'd  To his Successful Arms whole Nations yield  And freely give him up an untry'd Field  At his bless'd Feet the Rich  Tortosa  lay  And Matchless Conduct gain'd him  Lerida  Valencia  's Kingdom Gloriously he won  And triumph'd o'er the prostrate  Arragon  But hold unwary Muse no higher soar  He that did this alas must do no more  Oh that thy Numbers cou'd but reach my Aim  How wou'd I celebrate his Glorious Name  How wou'd I Paint the Battles he has won  And all the Noble Actions he has done  How wou'd I Paint him spilling Gen'rous Blood  And tempting Death for his dear Country's good  How wou'd I draw his two illustrious Sons  Proud of their mangled Flesh and shatter'd Bones  How wou'd I tune my elevated Song  To Shame those Men who do  CAMILLUS  wrong  But since his VVorks thro' Clouds are forc'd to Shine  How can I hope Success for such as mine  Let Vertue be Rewarded if it can  VVhen Gratitude forgets so Great a MAN  FINIS
