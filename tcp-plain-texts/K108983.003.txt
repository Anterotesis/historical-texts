 THE YOUNGER BROTHER  THE YOUNGER BROTHER A NOVEL IN THREE VOLUMES  WRITTEN BY  Mr DIBDIN  THUS RUNS THE WORLD AWAY  Shakespear  VOL III  LONDON  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD AT HIS WAREHOUSE NO STRAND OPPOSITE THE ADELPHI  THE YOUNGER BROTHER  BOOK V  WHICH INCREASES LIKE A SNOWBALL  CHAPTER I  CONTAINING A CONFLICT SOME RETROSPECTION A PICTURE AN ATTEMPT AT AN ATONEMENT AND ANOTHER AT AN IMPOSITION  THOUGH Charles betrayed no symptoms of un∣easiness in his face when he left the room after the adventure at the inn perhaps no heart ever was torn with more poignant distress Love prudence and disdain assailed his heart at once and he went to bed absorbed in a conflict of wretchedness com∣pared to which his last sleepless reflections in the prison at Lyons were rapture  At that time his conscious innocence and the  wrongs that were done him roused his honest forti∣tude till it towered superior to all possible conse∣quences Now mark the difference After taking the resolution upon the most laudable grounds of never holding communication with those who had traduced him after fortifying himself against all the bewitching power of Annette's charms after sus∣taining a long illness caused and continued by those fond and importunate whisperings which would fain have stimulated him to clear himself and reap the glory of obtaining his wishes by the defeat of his rival after at length congratulating himself upon the full establishment of his health and in that his staunch determination to abide by what he had resolved to fall into the most effectual means of opening a wound that had been all but mortal and at this time only cicatrized was a trial one would think under which his whole resolution must for∣sake him It would certainly be a trait of perfect nature if the reader found him the next morning familiarly at breakfast with Sir Sidney and his fa∣mily The very reverse however happened which I shall contend is fairly as natural upon the prin∣ciple of two vessels which standing upon different tacks may yet meet each other with the same wind In short had his down been points of needles he could not have shifted twined and turned himself  about with greater pain nor at every new position have met with a more novel torment  The charms of Annette coupled with the morti∣fying difficulties which stood between him and his hopes wounded him on one side in a thousand places which shifting to avoid the saucy familiarity of Gloss and the humility into which he was thrown by Sir Sidney's injurious suspicions and ill judged pride gave it him home  He saw he felt he found himself conquered by Annette Her lovely modest speaking souldis∣solving perfections stood confessed and he found himself their certain evident unequivocal victim but was this to overcome so reasonable a system of independant integrityto throw down a structure of honest hopeful tranquillity which it had taken him so much time and pains to rear  In short tossed about between such violent and contending passions he raved sighed swore wept execrated his fate and blessed his stars till at length his valet interrupting him with an account that the horses were ready he collected himself rose mounted and rode away before any person got up who could possibly stagger his now inviolable reso∣lution  He made for Paris with every possible expedition where he endeavoured to lose in that stream of pleasure those irresistable bars to his happiness which spight of all his resolution presented them∣selves so very difficult is it in some cases for rea∣son to establish tranquillity  After a month's stay at Paris he returned to his native country where he will now be seen in the character of an independant young man without a single friend or adviser  Here it will not be amiss to recount that strange train of accidents which brought about so extraor∣dinary a meeting between Sir Sidney and our hero at Aix la Chapelle  Emma since she found it in vain to tamper with Charles determined if possible to get at some in∣telligence of him through Figgins who contrary to her expectationfor she thought it a forlorn hope as we may see by her last letternot only informed her of his motions but corroborated his informa∣tion by shewing her some passages in his letters  No sooner had Emma heard of our hero's sick∣ness and danger of being taken off by a lingering consumption than mad as it may appear she de∣termined  to carry the whole family to be witness to their handy work This was certainly a trait worthy of her sagacity She anticipated her suc∣cess and enjoying her imaginary triumph pictured to herself the dying lover revived by the gentle and tender attention of his mistress and entreated to life and happiness by the returning indulgence of her relenting father  The only difficulty was how to bring it about but even this was no impediment to the genius of Emma She revived the subject of Annette's mo∣ther which since the information from Mr In∣got had only been darkly spoken of through the medium of epistolary enquiry Sir Sidney had at times talked of a trip to the south of France and Emma pressed Lady Roebuck very hard to keep him to his intention for which she offered many notable reasons It would wear off the chagrin that had been caused by such an alteration in the family hopes it would enlarge the ideas of Annette and if any lurking wish remained behind in favour of Charles by employing her mind on new objects it would dispose her to receive with more alacrity the solicitations of Mr Glossfor every body but herself supposed Charles to be in Italywhom Emma was of opinion they ought to take with them for reasons best known to herself  In short this plotting jade had fairly formed a pretty feasible plan of finishing this history about the very time when and near the very place where I who knew better things thought proper to throw it into a new perplexity  With very little importunity Sir Sidney con∣sented to give the ladies this jaunt They took the route through part of Artois to Rhiems and passed through Chalons to Dijon near which city had lived the Count de Gramont who was an old intimate of Sir Sidney and through whose interest he now meant to make his enquiries At this house they called and to the great surprise and sorrow of the baronet he found that the old count had four years before paid the debt of nature and that his only son whom Sir Sidney knew when a child enjoyed now his title and his fortunes  Sir Sidney was hospitably welcomed by the young count who beguiled away a week of their time very agreeably The family then prepared to continue their journey No mention however would have been made of their intended enquiries had not the young count previously and luckily too formed a design at this time to visit Province where he in∣sisted upon making his father's friend welcome at a small estate in that quarter The fact is he had  fallen violently in love with Annette and nothing could have kept him from soliciting her hand from her father but the evident certainty that Gloss was intended to be the happy man Standing pretty well however in his own opinion and being a man of family and fortune he had but little difficulty to persuade himself he should soon outshine his rival if he could contrive to be of their party a little lon∣ger Growing however more and more enamoured every hour and not being able to stay till they ar∣rived at their journey's end he had on that very day the reader and I were witnesses to his disgrace at Aix la Chapelle sustained a handsome though positive refusal from Annette and another from her father Raging with disappointment he flew to wine for relief This fired him ten times more when coming to the inn to bury his intoxication and his wretchedness in sleep he was stopt by his  valet de chambre  who being the factotum of his amours promised him the accomplishment of that which he never before had the temerity to think of much less hope for In short after telling him a hundred lies to inflame him he had the address by the help of the chambermaid of the inn to place him in a closet in the chamber where Annette was to sleep He saw her enter with Emma who having set down the candle began to look over some linen and other things for Lady RoebuckAs  they laid across her arm  'Well really' said she 'there is no knowing what to wear in this same France it is the strangest motley place'  'Nay' said Annette 'there is a great deal to gratify one's curiosity The thing I like least in it is this troublesome count If he and Mr Gloss were where my poor Charles is and he in their place France would be a paradise to me'  'Come come' said Emma 'do not despair'  'Despair' answered Annette 'why should I hope Were he here did he love meand that I am afraid Emma he does not be where he willwhat would it avail me designed as I am by the will of the best though in this case the cruelest father for another'  'Don't be uneasy about that' said Emma 'I have a secret to cure your father and all the world of such a folly as that would be In short I am much more pleased that Mr Gloss should be in∣tended for your husband than any man in the world since it must not be Mr Hazard I cannot say so much for the count for he has a thousand advantages over the other and if Sir Sidney were not so attached to his parliamentary friend we should find ourselves a good deal embarrassed to  get rid of the other A painterand it is the same with an author for words are figurative co∣lourscan put that object in shadow which is a disgrace to the groupe but he would be blamed for doing this by one that ornaments it But come my sweet lady I hope you are nearer hap∣piness than you think for One thing isbut you must not betray it for your lifethat Charles is not in Italy and I hope it will not be long be∣fore you see him'  'Not in Italy' cried Annette 'not long be∣fore I see him Do my dear my kind Emma explain yourself'  'My lady waits for these things' said Emma 'I will tell you more when I return till then be as happy in idea as the pleasing picture I have drawn can make you  So saying she retired with a view of going to Lady Roebuck  Seeing there was no time to be lost the count the moment this conversation was over which he had listened to but understood not a word of came out of his hiding place and surprising An∣nette at the door locked it and began as we have seen to be pretty free with her He was however so awed by her beauty that he had very little shocked her delicacy when she was relieved by our hero  whom she no sooner saw alarmed and confused as she was than she could not help fancyingthe fore∣going conversation being strongly in her mindthat the whole was one of Emma's romantic schemes This when they retired to rest she scrupled not to confess to Emma laying before her very strongly all the consequences of any premature design to de∣ceive her father which she was sure if he disco∣vered he would never forgive and which could not fail instead of mending their affairs to leave them in a worse condition than ever She thanked her with warmth with tenderness with tears for the attention she paid to her wishes declared that no one ever had a truer friend but it was plain for∣tune determined to persecute her and therefore all her kindness would be useless  Emma was very much touched at Annette's good opinion of her and thanked her for it in terms of sincere acknowledgment She lamented with her the great probability that indeed there was of her fustaining more persecutions but she said it was the lot of virtue to be essayed but that thanks to heaven to those trials it owed its purity  She said she knew well the implacability of Charles's temper which she was convinced would not relax a tittle but this in some degree she  could not disapprove for he had been very ill treated  Our hero's conduct indeed was in Emma's opi∣nion the noblest she had ever heard of but then she knew to what it was attributable To say the truth she knew much more than the reader imagines or perhaps knows himself  Emma acknowledged that she knew of his being in the south of France but that his coming there that afternoon was purely accidental at least she knew nothing to the contrary for that she had not expected to see him till they came to Montpelier where he had been for many months at the point of death though it was plain he was now not only hap∣pily recovered but much handsomer than ever  Night alone beheld those blushes which suffused Annette's cheeks at these words They were ex∣cited by a flattering hope but were as instantly dis∣sipated by intruding fear which changed the car∣nation to a pallid hue and started two pearly tears that trickling from her beautiful eyes lost them∣selves upon her pillow  Emma said that though Charles must now stand much higher in every body's mind than he had lately  done yet it was plain Sir Sidney had felt himself treated with indignity which would operate in conjunction with the insiduous arts of Gloss to Charles's great disadvantage They would see how∣ever the result of matters in the morning In the mean time she was glad the count's hopes were at an end for as to Gloss she begged her lovely young lady to make herself perfectly easy for as he never could be her husband which she would herself take good care of rather good than harm would come of his hovering about her for though a troublesome insect himself he would serve to keep off others who were more so She said she held it good doctrine to use evil agents to come at truth and maintained that HOBBES is right where he says  'that it is law∣ful to make use of ill instruments to do ourselves good' and adds 'If I were cast into a deep pit and the devil was to put down his cloven foot I would take hold of it to be drawn out'  The great object of Annette's concern was lest Charles did not love her which doubt Emma un∣dertook to dissipate She said it was impossible he was the best and most charming young man upon earth as was she the most virtuous and lovely young lady that she was as sure they were born for each other as if she read their history in the book of  fate but that troubles and many yet they cer∣tainly were born to encounter  'Come come' said she 'my dear Miss An∣nette you are very well off our whole affairs are a novel I confess but yours are not the distresses in which young ladies so situated generally find themselves Your father is not hard and boister∣ous like Western nor is Gloss bewitching and seducing like Lovelace I can dash his hopes in a moment whenever I please Comfort your∣self then my dear lady you have in me a firm and though not very old yet I will venture to say an experienced friend and I shall as surely pilot the vessel into port as that I am now con∣ducting it with skill and foresight in spight of all the adverse winds and beating waves that surround it'  Emma was now in her element She soothed An∣nette with every kind and friendly argument her in∣ventionwhich was pretty fertilecould supply She instanced all the similar situations she had read of and proved to a demonstration that happiness was as certainly the ultimatum of Annette's fortune as that the interval would be filled with many trials of her virtue her temper and her fortitude  Upon the whole Mrs Emma determined never again to give a hint of what she had in agitation to Annette Young and timid as she was who knew how far her prudence would be a security for her not betraying it She plainly saw that though Charles could not be robbed of the palm he had so handsomely earned yet as Sir Sidney had expressed himself in terms of great warmth after our hero had left the room this was not the moment to press her present design  After a variety of deliberations with herself while Annette slept she determined to see Charles early in the morning and advise him to follow their steps till she should give him a fit opportunity of declaring himself and in order to induce him to this she would lay him down the strongest reasons in her power without trenching absolutely upon some secrets which she meant to make use of as a  denier resort  lest he from rage should make as bad an use of them as Annette would from simplicity  Having well digested this plan she commended herself to the arms of sleep where she continued locked so long that when she came to enquire in the morning for our hero he was some miles on his way to Paris  I shall now recur to the scene of action out of which Mr Charles was seen just now to stalk with such conscious dignity  When Sir Sidney and the rest first came into the chamber they really did not know what to think of the matter it was so sudden and unexpected but as soon as they heard the Frenchman's handsome accusation of himself and found it impossible that our hero could be any other than the champion of the lady they really had the conscience to give him credit for one worthy action and as truth has the knack of dispersing falsehood in more ways than one it all of a sudden struck Sir Sidney that Charles must either be strangely altered or that report had not in all cases done him justice for that it was impossible or at least very unlikely that any man should hold such a contrary disposition as to be a devil today and an angel tomorrow  These were Sir Sidney's reflections Lady Roe∣buck's were still kinder Emma's were admira∣tion and Annette's tender delicate lively grati∣tude and feeling thus they really made a very pretty group for a picture  Against the chimney piece stood the musing  baronet with his hand to his forehead His beau∣tiful daughter who had accidentally fallen into an arm chair held also her hand to her face which however did not conceal her tears of indignation for her ravisher or those burning blushes full of love and thanks to her deliverer  Lady Roebuck though in astonishment too by turns eyed her husband Annette and Charles with regards plainly intimating her perturbed and anxious sensations while Emma firm and collected searched every eye and would fain have pervaded every heart to furnish herself with arguments for that masterstroke she was now meditating  Our hero as I have already described was trans∣fixed like a statue but it was rather like an inani∣mate body whose soul had left it and fled to that heaven on which the eyes seemed to bend with re∣luctant pleasure  As to the count he had his head against the wall without daring to look any one in the face  Just at this critical moment every thing seemed to depend upon the first word that should be  spoken which unfortunately coming from the mouth of Mr Gloss our hero's love gave place or rather spur to his resentment and so threw him off his guard as to occasion that disrespect which he shewed to Sir Sidney and his abrupt departure after∣wards  Sir Sidney never felt so sensible a mortification in his life He was plainly upon the point of mak∣ing such advances to Charles as very likely would have led to a complete reconciliation He had balanced as we have seen as to his deserts from the first moment he felt that warm sensation of ge∣nerous gratitude for his daughter's protection  This prepossession in his favour his person which called to mind a thousand partial ideas did not a little contribute to strengthen How then must this fair prospect of engendering goodwill be un∣timely destroyed when such a blight as our hero's terms of rebuke were held out to one who expected solicitation instead of defiance His kind thoughts immediately receded and resentment filled their place but however with so very little foundation that he was obliged to search for a new object to gratify it and immediately insisted upon a full ex∣planation from the count of his conduct  The count charged it very properly upon the ras∣cality of his servant whom he instantly called up paid his wages and kicked out of the room an example were it more imitated would save the honour of many young gentlemen of pleasure  The count then said his crime could not be pal∣liated otherwise he would never stir from An∣nett's feet till he had implored her pardon nor from Sir Sidney's presence till he had consented she should be his As it was he would hide his dis∣grace in absence and never again presume to ap∣pear before a family whom he had treatedinstead of the respect due to strangerswith the ill manners and villany of a ruffian  He further said he should love the young gentle∣man as long as he lived who had prevented his de∣sign and were not his influence all gone he should strongly recommend him to Sir Sidney's friendship and consideration  With these words he took his leave went to an∣other inn and the next morning left the town about an hour after our hero  A conduct so collected and uniform in one mo∣ment  engendered a new plot in the imagination of Mr Gloss  'My dear Sir Sidney' said he 'this is the most barefaced business I ever saw in my life don't you see it'  'Upon my word I do not even know what you mean' answered the baronet  'Why my dear sir nothing can be plainerThe count whose overstrained complaisance in∣duced him to accompany us to Province did it to serve his friend which you may easily see by the latter part of his fine florid speech Mr Hazard was not in Italy but lurking about till you should come to France For this was Miss Roebuck to be insultedfor this was she to be rescuedfor this was the servant to be kicked down stairs for this was the champion to behave with insolence to youand finally for this was he by the re∣pentant ravisherjust the last man in the world who ought to take such a libertyto be recom∣mended to your favour and consideration'  Sir Sidney could not admit the entire force of this charge though he could not deny but it was clear connected and ingenious and indeed full of such apparent probability that it might have naturally struck any body It was however late and as his  daughter at any rate was safe and peace restored before they hazarded any further conjectures he thought it would be but wise to consult their pil∣lows Thus Annette and Emma were left to them∣selves where passed that dialogue and those delibe∣rations already mentioned  CHAPTER II  CONSISTING OF JOURNEYING AND CASTLEBUILDING  WHEN it was known the next morning that both our hero and the count had left Aix la Chapelle Sir Sidney kept up to his belief by Mr Gloss began in reality to think that the whole business of the night before was a concerted matter between those two gentlemen It wore so much the com∣plexion of those tricks he had heard of before and was in every respect so like what he had been taught to think of the genius of our hero that it scarcely admitted of a doubt But were this the case what did it infer Why truly because all his friends would not believe him innocent of pranks that had been so substantiated he must meditate an injury that ought never to be forgiven Did not his haughty speech at parting confirm it For even sup∣pose that he had no motive for what he did but common justice nobody would in so disdainful a manner refused to be thanked No the matter  was apparently very plain and if really what it ap∣peared it only proved that he whom they had hopes of a penitent had now given proof that he was incorrigible But were it allowed to be possi∣blewhich there was very little ground forthat all this strange business should have been the mere effect of chance was it even in that case a proper thing to lie at the caprice and whim of an absurd young man Was it through pride and disdain he meant to aim at conciliation Did he expect to be begged and entreated to forgive Had he so far forgot all the duties resulting from those motives which alone could worthily have excited such con∣duct as to think it ought to erect him into pride and haughtiness And lastly had he the vanity to suppose that having left the town be the motive what it might any body would take the trouble to send after him  Weighing all these considerations Sir Sidney was determined to repay pride with pride and though if it ever came to his knowledge as a positive cer∣tainty that Charles had acted in this business disin∣terestedly he should conceive himself under an obligation he should nevertheless look upon it as one of that sort which a vain supercilious conduct had completely cancelled  Thus was the baronet at least as firmly set against our hero as ever he could be against the baronet and fully confirmed in these sentiments which Gloss failed not to extol  Lady Roebuck Annette and even Emma though not obliged to acquiesce were at least prohibited from making objections  To bring them to England as fast as possible where I am impatient to attend our hero it will be only necessary to say a few words  They kept on their way for Province where Sir Sidney found every thing very much altered The former abbess of the convent where Annette's mo∣ther was supposed to have died had been replaced some years and her successor could give no more account of the matter than that she understood Miss Le Clerc had gone to England with permission some years before In short she told Ingot's story with the addition of her having returned settled her affairs made interest to be of a new order more suitable to her circumstances to a certain convent of which order she had retired at a distant town where it was said they might hear further tidings of her  Sir Sidney finding Lady Roebuck and Emma very anxious to get at the bottom of this businessfor as to Annette she was always taugh  to believe that her mother was deadindulged t  eir curiosity though this same town was out of their road to Pa∣ris The scent however was soon lost for Miss Le Clerc had shifted her place of residence one more and they either could not or would not give the smallest information weere she was gone they therefore got away expeditiously to Paris at which city they arrived a few days after our hero had left it and after passing away about five weeks very pleasantly returned in safety to their own coun∣try  Charles in his way to Paris to drive Annette from his thoughts began to consider in earnest what he should do in the world He was young had a tolerable right to think well of his abilities and would very shortly touch a large sum of moneyHe had all his life employed his time industriously and thought he should now wrong his country and himself if he let his talents rust in indolence  The sublimest wish of his heart was to patronise merit He should not however he feared find him∣self rich enough He must oke out his fortune then To effect this he hit upon fifty schemes  but was not able to pitch on any thing he thought likely to answer his purpose till he met with an English nobleman in Paris who initiated him in the mystery of preferment and plainly shewed him all its devious and intricate paths  Charles contemplated this road to fortune with eager pleasure His booby brother was a lord his supercilious rival a member of parliament and a po∣pular speaker should he then live a mere obscure private gentleman  In short he bargained with the peer for a bo∣rough The peer on their arrival in England made the broomstick who was then member va∣cate his seat by an acceptance of the Chiltern hun∣dreds and at the expence of something more than eight thousand pounds our hero found himself a member of the third branch of the legislature  My lord by convention was to follow up Charles's initiation with his patronage which had only the trifling condition annexed to it of always voting with the minister A fortnight however did not pass before the impossibility of this was made selfevident  He had consented to the purchase of a borough  because he had been told that such things are as openly sold as shoes and stockings or any other article that a man chuses to appropriate to himself upon paying its full value or perhaps a little more but to support that it was noonday at midnightor indeed any of those many positions he was almost ordered to secondto hold forth for three hours to the great detriment of his lungs and what is worse of his varacity with a view like legerdemain of shewing a question in every possible point of view but the right and then sanction this outrage on truth this fraud on his own conscience by voting that it might be carried into a law and so be ac∣cessary to the multiplying of these outrages and these frauds to the detriment of his fellow citizensthis was a condition he could not prevail on himself to fulfil and thereforeat which he wondered with∣out causethe parliament being dissolved in about five months after he took his seat our hero's bo∣rough notwithstanding a fresh three thousand pounds which he laid out in contestationthough how it should be spent is astonishing for the place had not above thirteen housesreceived its former member Mr Stopgap who as complaisantly as before in less than a twelvemonth took again the Chiltern hundreds that the borough might be pur∣chased by a new bubble who however bought it with better success than our hero for by always  saying aye he soon got a pension well worth the money he had paid for it  By the way Charles's conduct in parliament was the most curious thing in nature Having no bias but truth his opinions seemed to wear a very motley and strange appearance to those who were hack∣neyed in the way of debate but indeed he was as Kiddy would call it up with them for even those who argued on the same side by having imbibed a passion for rhetoric a quaintness of expression a vein of drollery or some other quality of embellish∣ing and flattering truth out of the very form they ought to wish it should wear appeared to him the most unhandy handlers of an argument that could be conceived In short he was an innovator and nobody was sorry to lose him for said they a man who votes sometimes on one side and some∣times on the other can be of no party and there∣fore ought not to be a member of the house of commons  Sir Sidney it is true as an independant country gentleman voted with his conscience but yet this was generally on one side for by prejudice of education he was pretty well fixed as to his senti∣ments concerning the government of this country In short every thing that promoted the blessing of  peace he supported every thing that led to the desolation of war he discountenanced  By the way Sir Sidney and our hero considered one another as perfect strangers during the whole time they sat together as members  Charles when he returned to England received of Mr Balance the gross sum of twentynine thou∣sand pounds His borough and his private ex∣pences had in seven months sunk this sum to nearly half This nettled him not a little To set out with the laudable intention certainly of exalting himself but with the purest motives of public in∣tegrity and sustain in so short a time so much dis∣graceit was not to be borne He had given proof on many private occasions that he could wield a pen he was determined to try whether he could not do it and to effect on a public one  He lost no time but immediately brought out a pamphlet which he called "Parliamentary Consis∣tency" It was pithy sensible and severe and laid bare all the manoeuvres of making and garbling acts of parliament shewing that as chicanery was engendered with law no wonder if it grew up with it  Nothing however was gratified in this business but revenge A few sensible people found a great deal of merit in the publication the booksellers declared that the young man touched in pretty smart round periods enough and that when his for∣tune should be spent they would be glad to employ him at  per sheet  The active mind of our hero would not let him sit down quietly under so heavy a reduction of his fortune He thought every hour an age till he should be engaged in something to redeem his loss Had he remained in parliament for any length of time he had no sort of doubt but he should have completed all his wishes without the interference of the minister  He had with great accuracy noticed where the laws were deficient in relieving the poor and op∣pressed and indeed all descriptions of mankind in helpless situations He had expected upon point∣ing out amendments in these lawswhich he con∣ceived could easily be donehe should erect him∣self into such popularity that he could command assistance from that state to which he should thus have been so useful  As it was he had made but little progress in  this desirable pursuit nevertheless what he had done was a beginning and it actually had raised an alarm among forestallers engraters and other ene∣mies to the lower part of the community  He had also a plan of inducing a parliamentary attention to the liberal arts and he meant as a preliminary step to try at a regulation of public amusements  Many other benevolent ideas occupied his thoughts tending both to public accommodation and private convenience but the scheme that most delighted him was one by means of which he had flattered himself he should be able to curtail the privileges of lawyers whose emoluments drained from the necessitous he proved by computation amounted to a third more upon any twenty given causes than the damages given in those causes by the jury and were the aggregate account of ex∣pences and damages come at for seven or seventeen nay or seventy years he had reason to think the proportion would be just the same  This clearly proved that a man with ever so just a cause had better put up with a first loss let it be what it might than seek the only redress the laws  of his country had permitted him to have recourse to Yet no step had been taken to cure this evil  His catalogue of such abuses as came under the cognizance of the courts was immense Those abuses of which the courts had not the smallest idea were a still larger list and proved that the sole mode the legislature had provided to decide those two grand articles by which all the ties of goodfellow∣ship are cemented by which ranks are distinguished property ascertained and securedIn short right and wronginstead of holding out security and being a blessing was a curse in a land of freedom that the most oppressive tyranny had never equalled in any country  This last enumeration of abuses he said was the most grievous thing that could be conceived to peo∣ple of middling life These abuses consisted of pro∣cesses that went no farther than arrests and accom∣modations in which the attornies though adverse professionally were privately intimate friendsThese erected themselves into judge and jury and the result was nine times out of ten that the defen∣dant to avoid imprisonment was forced into terms impossible to be complied with  Could any provision take in all it was meant to  comprehend which failed of effect in any particular The laws of England did in a very essential parti∣cular they precluded the poor from any benefit from them while the rich could use them to op∣press that very poor for whose defenceif by law is meant human securitybenevolent reason says they ought in an especial manner to provide  'How can this be' says the lawyer 'the poor may sue in  forma pauperis  '  What do they gain by this Why truly they are allowed the stamps but who will allow them an attorney that will manage their affairs for a single farthing less than his full feeswhich always include threefourths of his bill  These as I have said were some among the many resources from which Charles hoped to draw much public benefit nor did he o  these subjects appear to have a superficial judgment for he had such sweetness of manners and was so void of any pride except that which results from conscious in∣tegrity that he did not disdain to search for infor∣mation among those where alone he could demon∣strably find it  To say truth in conjunction with a few other  worthy members of parliament he bent his time to a full consideration of cases entirely among the poorer part of the community and it was not rare to see him at workhouses and prisons where his purse secretly following his generous heart bellow∣ed on him as much satisfaction by relieving a widow or an orphan as some menhis brother perhaps for onewould have received in distressing a tenant or seducing his daughter  Finding however all his hopes no more than a dreamfrom which he had been so disagreeably awokehe had now no ability but to pity those whom he could no longer assist  He might to be sure have purchased another borough but he now saw the fallacy of such traf∣fic and well knew that if he could ensure a feat as long as he should live it would be utterly im∣possible for him to carry any one point till he had previously sold his opinion and then what would he be but the echo of another man's will without having a will of his own  Determined however to do all he couldslender as his means werehe concerted several feasible plans by which while he reasonably improved  his money he fancied he should procure a most desirable relief to many who stood in need of such assistance  CHAPTER III  THE RATIFICATION OF ONE TREATY AND THE INFRACTION OF ANOTHER  WHILE Charles is digesting his liberal plansthat I may keep this history compact and all its characters within viewI shall recur a little to such persons and things as may enable me so to do  In the first place I do not wish the reader should fancy that I made Charles all of a sudden so vio∣lently in love with Annette at Aix la Chapelle for no better purpose than merely to put him into a mad freak or two and there an end It is true he swore a great many bitter oaths that he would sooner tear his tongue from his mouth and his heart from his bosom than suffer one to speak or the other to dictate a single syllable that could betray the folly of loving one whose family undeservedly despised him But does not the reader know that this was rather what he uttered than what it was in his power to put in practice Was he not a lover  Did not the positive confirmation of that fact take its date from the business of Aix la Chapelle And could any thing he afterwards said or thought be considered in any other light than as the declara∣tion of a maniac who in the midst of a paroxism tells you he is in his right senses The injunction he laid upon his tongue was well enough and I question whether the threatened mutilation or some∣thing like it might not have followed its infringe∣ment But as to his heart Lord help the poor man It was about as much in his power to direct that as it would be for a miser to prevail upon him∣self to give a poor wretch a guinea whom he saw expiring for want  In short we see him prancing about from one wretched object to another and persuading amus∣ing interesting wheedling and coaxing this same heart into all the amusements for which such kind of men directors are worthily formed and to be sure I cannot deny but this master of his had much pleasure in this sort of employmentbut this made no difference it repaid him with interest the mo∣ment it was unoccupied and even brought up these very actions to support its arguments crastily sug∣gesting that if there was such rich delight in lessen∣ing the burden of our fellow creatures's misery alone how exquisitely would the delight be heigh∣tened  by sharing that task with the object of one's af∣fection  It was in one of those moments that his heart had been dictating to him in this arrogant style when Emma stood before him His astonishment was excessive  'Good God' said he 'Emma'and then recollecting himself 'what brought you here'  'I come Mr Hazard' said Emma 'ambassa∣dress from the court of love upon busiress of im∣portance and I am determined to carry away with me a catagorical answer'  'Stay' said Charles 'if the investigation of Sir Sidney's conduct and my family concerns are in the smallest degree to make a part of what you have to saythough I confess I should be very ungrateful not to give you credit for the best intentions towards meI will not hear a single syllable'  'Indeed sir' said Emma 'I would not affront you by investigating any such ridiculous subject APOLLODORUS the architect would not yield in opinion to the Emperor ADRIAN and was put to  death FAVORINUS however yielded to him in every thing for which conduct being reproved by his friends he said  "Shall not I easily suffer him to be the most learned and knowing of all men who commands thirty legions"  'Now Mr Gloss may be FAVORINUS as much as he pleases but I in spight of all consequences shall be APOLLODORUS for if Sir Sidney commanded three hundred legions instead of thirty I should never subscribe to his absurd opinionss whatever may be my fate so you may be perfectly easy on that head My business at present is confined to one subject and you will find it necessary upon the footing I mean to put it that you should give a reasonable and decided answer Void of passion void of revenge void of any thing but what you honestly and truly feel nor do I wish to humble you or make you deviate from your pride which I declare is the truest I ever read of I look upon you for your years as a prodigy Your fair chaste penetrating understanding is remarkable and though any one may see your great aptness for predelection and firstsight prepossession yet when once deceivedtill when you cannot have the meanness to harbour suspiciondecided wa∣riness succeeds to illplaced confidence and I am sure no man will ever deceive you twice Your  first complaisance you think due to the world your second to yourself'  'Why my dear Emma' said Charles 'you speak with the gravity of an oracle'  'With the truth of one I know I do' said Emma  'But to what' returned our hero 'does all this tend'  'You shall hear' said Emma 'I want to know how far you will meet me upon the ground of a union with Annette'  'It is impossible' said Charles  'Do you love her' returned Emma  'Come come' said Charles 'I see your drist If I tenderly loved Annette there would be no∣thing but I ought to sacrifice for her nay there could be no attention however arduous no affec∣tion however violent sincere and unalterable in the remotest degree comparable to her desertsHer duty to her father is the first sentiment of her soul At the feet of this duty I ought to lay down that victory which my honour well fought for and won If I love her I sa  I ought to do all this but I will speak plain I cannot shrink into no∣thing Emma The first and dearest wish of my heartshould my father's grief fatally prevailwas to find a father in Sir Sidney but thanks to his sinceritywhich was rather of the rudestthe same line that told me I had lost my father  that I might not flatter myself with any thing that might console me told me also that I had lost my friend'  'My dear sir' said Emma 'I want none of these arguments to believe that your resolution is laudably taken or that it ought to be unbroken I want only this that you will not estrange your∣self from a subject that once gave you the dearest pleasure but so far keep your heart free that should the veil that at present hides your truth and innocence from Sir Sidney be withdrawn not by your contrivance but by his own conviction through the evidence of his senses you will in such case agree to that reconciliation which he shall propose'  'Agree' said Charles 'I am more hurt for Sir Sidney than for myself for of him I am ashamed'  'And I too' said Emma  'But to manifest' said Charles 'that I only stickle for a just punctilio sacredly due to my honourand the more as I am my own protector as I am the general and the army that must fight the battle aloneif I were assured that Sir Sidney would believe me an in∣jured man upon my own single word and honour I would take him by the hand tomorrow and esteem that moment the happiest of my life'  'That he will not then' said Emma 'therefore it is a folly to talk I know however that in time he will do more for he can be just and he will then believe he has wronged you My business relates to what is to be done in the interimYou will one day or other have justice and the farther it is put off the more complete it will be In the mean while will you keep a hope in your heart that Annette may be yours'  'Emma' said Charles 'it is a joke to talk in this manner the matter should be one thing or the other'  'It cannot' said Emma 'There is a certainty that every thing will be right but it is as certain that every thing is wrong at present The only thing I am now certain of is that Annette loves you'  'Loves me' said Charles  'Tenderly ardent∣ly gratefully loves you' said Emma 'Nay sir if you will have a heroic propriety in your conduct so will we in ours We will be proud like you We will hide what we feel like you We will be unhappy like you Nay if you provoke us we will go into a consumption'  'Like who' cried Charles  'Like you' answered Emma  'Nay' said Charles 'can my Annette love me so dearly'  'She does' said Emma 'I am her ambassadress and my instructions are to tell you so'  'Then take your catagorical answer' said Charles 'Tell her that when I saw her at Aix la Chapelle every resolution I had formed before left me I was from that moment her's uncondi∣tionally and this induced me to retire for if I had not I should the next morning have fallen at the feet of Sir Sidney'  'I am very glad you did retire' said Emma 'for the breach would by that means have been so widened that you could never have been friends As it is'  'As it is' said Charles interrupting her 'let her rule my fate I will do whatever she com∣mands'  'Her commands then' said Emma 'will be that you continue to love her and write to her under cover to me In every other respect do not bait an inch of the conduct you have laid down for yourself'  This proposal was so consonant to our hero's sen∣timents that he accepted it with delight In short the preliminaries were adjusted and agreed to and Emma marched off in triumph with the ratifica∣tion of her treaty  Though Emma was well contented with her ne∣gociation yet her tongue itched to enter upon an∣other subject but she knew too well with whom she had to deal to let her curiosity get the better of her prudence It was this she had heardnay she knew it beyond doubt or nothing could have induced her to believe itthat our hero kept a mis∣tress that he had a private lodging for her and vi∣sited her as often as his leisure permitted  This indeed was true and though she thought nothing of now and then a random intrigue in a young man yet an engagement of this kind might especially as he was surrounded with enemies prove of dangerous consequence to his interest in An∣nette  This fact as a historian of veracity I am obliged to admit Charles certainly in his commerce with women of indifferent reputationto which his youth and the warmth of his constitution too much  addicted himhad met with one who had some∣thing more decent in her manners than the rest and upon her promise to detach herself from her abandoned companions he had made her comfort∣able at that time and intended afterwards to pro∣vide for her  It was impossible for Charles to have the least de∣gree of intimacy with any person and not be at∣tached to their interest This girl had many at∣tractions which her lover was not insensible of Nay his word might have been deeply engaged had not her levity checked his hand As it was he stood engaged in an intercourse pleasureable enough and which he could put an end to when he pleased without a breach of honour  The moment therefore Emma went away this he determined to do for he swore that Annette should in future engross all his amorous thoughts He called immediately at the lodgings of Miss New∣ton where without ceremony he entered the bed∣chamber but what was his astonishment when in so doing he saw her in bed at twelve o'clock at noon with the waiter of a bagnio  Charles made the gentleman jump up very coolly  kicked him down stairs and threw his clothes after him This done he waited on the lady who would first have brazened the matter out but finding he was absolutely bent on parting with her she dis∣solved into tears  Seizing this opportunity he said he did not chuse to be made a dupe of that he had conceived the comforts she had tasted would have made her better consider her own interest but he plainly saw that she could relish no pleasures that were not tainted with vicious ingratitude He should not however upbraid her perhaps he himself had been to blame in supposing that one so utterly abandoned should retain a spark of shame or decency  He added that her furniture watch and indeed all he had given herwhich was no trifleshe might keep to this he should now add a hundred pounds which he hoped she would make a good use of  The lady attempted at a reply but fell into hys∣terics at which our hero recommen  ed  er to the maid and walked off saying he should send a person the next day to supply Miss Newton with  some money he intended her as she was not then in a condition to receive it  The lady when she came to herself and under∣stood her lover was gone and what was worse without leaving the hundred pounds stampt raved sighed swore danced laughed and sobbed all in a breath and after playing fifty curious passionate anticswhich she concluded by fairly kicking Betty out of the room because she had not the precau∣tion to shut the door and so prevent the discoveryshe breathed nothing but revenge and defiance  Mr Gloss had been among the number of this lady's admirers and had actually conferred on Charles a favour equally complaisant with that of the waiter before mentioned  From this same Mr Gloss had Emma at second hand received her information backed with such circumstances as it was impossible she could dis∣believe  Thus was our hero slandered for an attempt to d  tach  abandoned woman from her evil life by the very man who not only shared her crime but the wages of her iniquity for Mr Gloss with all  his aversion to Charles scrupled not to partake of his bountyas Mistress Dye has itat second hand  CHAPTER II  FULL OF INEFFECTUAL BENEVOLENCE  HAVING seen in what state were Charles's plea∣sures I shall now look after his affairs It has been already said that had fortune made him very rich he would through the influence of his own proper philanthropy certainly have given the poor and oppressed worthy cause to bless him and have been a MACAENAS nay a little AUGUSTUS in the opinion of many neglected men of abilities But this good will towards men failed as we have also said for want of a certain ingredient in that sort of work called the means He therefore tried whe∣ther by lifting himself into power he could not put himself into cash and thus accomplish what he had so set his heart upon In this also he was as much to seek and what now could he do Why resolve to embark the small remains of his fortune in the most feasible way that presented itself mak∣ing general benevolence the outline of his con∣duct  First he purchased a share in a place of public amusement which was coming to the very mart where genius was the traffic With what delight did he contemplate the pleasure he should receive in taking neglected merit by the hand and patro∣nizing those productions which the modest timidity of their author kept from the public because he had no patron How rejoice when he should rescue music from boorish barbarism and reconcile it to reason and naturewhen the heart should receive no impression but through the ear and when the sensations of the soul should fix the criterion of sound How be charmed when theatrical painting instead of monstrous should be natural  None of these desirable ends however was he fortunate enough to attain He found his partners too refractory and too much attached to their own ignorant and conceited measures to listen to him who was but an inconsiderable member among them Vainly did he represent that English amuse∣ments were they thrown into a right channel might very easily be made with alternate and neverending variety to charm expand unbend instruct improve the mind and in short disperse a most extensive and valuable fund of entertainment rich delightful and exhilirating as well as sensible use∣ful and moral Vainly did he shew this source  this mine they poor creatures were strangers to its value To speak plainer they knew of no merit which came not to them through the medium of flattery or was not generated in their own dullness and foisted on the town by ostensible blockheads who estimated their works by the quantity of ma∣nual labour  Not content with this our hero visited several gentlemen of undoubted and undeniable genius to whom he lamented the great want of their public exertions and entreated the advantage of their as∣sistance These he found had long retired in dis∣gust impossible to bear the affronts and humilia∣tions they had sustained from men to whomthough unable to judge of any thing worthy public noticethey must implicitly submit or retire while supercilious coxcombs in science only by dint of cringing and patronage were to set the pattern which the enlightened were to follow  Not to dwell longer at present on a matter selfevident to every man of sense in the kingdom but our hero he found greatly to his disappointment that if he had wished to commit to destruction every trait of real merit he had hit upon the very way of all others to effectuate his purpose He thereforein imitation of those men of genius whose disgust  against managers and pity for themselves and the degenerate age in which they lived had been so worthily excitedsoon determined to retire To do this he farmed out his share for an annuity whichfinding it would be ill paidhe afterwards fold for an inconsiderable sum and thus his failure of raising the glory of the arts in Great Britain cost him only about eighteen hundred pounds  He was not however dismayed at this His in∣tentions were the best in the world and how could he prevent either the vitiated taste of the public or the imposition of its purveyors  His second scheme was to give a temporary re∣liefall he could doto debtors during that in∣termediate detention between the capture and the commitment to prison He had as I have noticed paid a very nice attention to arrests in the earliest stages He had come at instances of men who by being brutally dragged out of their shops for a paltry sum to a spunging house and kept there under various illegal pretences for several daysthough ultimately releasedhad in the interim totally lost their credit and were never again able to hold up their heads He had found that bailiffs in consequence of such scandalous practices and extravagant charges at their houses had realized  large fortunes nay he learnt beyond all contra∣diction of one who had for a great length of time amassed annually three thousand pounds and was sure that some others were not much behind hand yet this intolerable expence and shameful disgrace was nothing to the barbarous want of feeling and diabolical unconcern which tortured the poor debtor in this legal purgatory  To remedy this evil at least in some degree our hero hit upon a plan that promised good success He took the lease of a large house had it parti∣tioned into a number of convenient apartments stored it with every proper article for his purpose procured a victualler's licence and placed a man in it of whom he had the best opinion but whom he obliged to bring a responsible person to be joint security with him to the sheriff  To this hotel debtors were by advertisement advised to go the moment they were arrestedfor it is then in their power to insist upon being carried where they pleaseand there for onefourth per∣haps onefifth of that sum for which they would be served with food and liquor they could neither eat nor drink and huddled promiscuously among filth and nastiness without a retreat unless perhaps by paying a still more exorbitant price where they  could consult their friendsthey were neatly ac∣commodated well served and in short provided with every pleasurable convenience and humane at∣tention that could at such a moment be most agree∣able to them Added to this an attorney of abili∣ties had a salary to attend every inmate of that hos∣pitable mansion with advice according to each man's different case  This liberal plan though it was a little mad and eccentric in something less than two years which time it lasted saved in the aggregate at least the sum of nineteen thou  and pounds in hard money to a set of unfortunate men and their fami∣lies besides a world of humiliation and disgrace and what was a still greater advantageby a fair appeal to the humanity of the creditor shewing him the impossibility of getting his money by send∣ing a man to prison conjuring him to commiserate the sufferings of his fellow creatures and other ar∣guments likely to disarm his angerat least three hundred of those unfortunate men who would other∣wise have gone to confinement and who it they did not die in it might almost as well do so for their credit would have been totally lost and their families reduced to poverty were given back to society mildly warned not to be guilty of future  indiscretions instead of thrown into a situation where strong necessity in spight of the best inten∣tions must have inevitably plunged them into ten times worse  Our hero had a particular pleasure in being in∣strumental towards healing those  meum  and  tuum  breaches He very often accompanied the house attorney and was peculiarly happy with the credi∣tor in that kind of argument which shewed him that he was like an angry school boy throwing one mar∣ble to find another and at last losing both In short he saw his benevolent institution thrive every day though it must be confessed to keepup its credit orders were now and then obliged to be given that no notorious swindlers or other well known sharpers might be admitted and this was pretty well managed by enquiring whether the deb∣tors brought there were tradesmen or men of libe∣ral professions or members of the church the army the court or of those other descriptions which would make it probable they were such objects as the spirit of the plan went to relieve Yet is it not astonishing that the world received this spirited in∣novation on official tyranny as a most unbecoming attempt to destroy the common usuage and sanc∣tioned progress of the law It was called a mad scheme and one that would finish by converting the  house into a receptacle for lunatics where the founder would be the first person admitted  One very curious thing that our hero came at through his researches was that many of these cases originated from the folly and frequently something worse of the creditors themselves An overgrown tradesman would coax a neighbour of the same busi∣ness into his debt and then arrest him to destroy his credit that so the coast might be left clear for himself Others would fasten upon minors whom they would supply upon long credit with bad goods at a high price and then arrest them the moment they became of age Many were the instances where booksellers musicshops and picturedealers had conferred obligations on those artists who had no medium but theirs through which to give their works to the world and who were arrested at the moment their creditor knew it was impossible to get any thing merely that they might make over some valuable work for a trifle  Charles strenuously exerted himself upon these occasions but he generally found the creditor in∣exorable and the poor devil o  a debtor obliged to submit to terms which must still further involve him with his hard taskmaster  Our hero saw the folly of persuasion and still more of proposing any accommodation through his own means Indeed it was out of his power to give way to the dictates of his philanthropy in any case which Emma when she heard of greatly approved for she said that Dean SWIFT rigid as he was could not bring his excellent plan of lending money in small sums to the perfection he wished it without endangering his fortune To which she added by way of comment  'that very few but men of indif∣ferent fortunes thought liberally which was a dread∣ful business since none but those of ample ones had it in their power to act so'  Charles nevertheless found means of remitting to the wife or daughter what a strict attention to the plan demanded from the father which was how∣ever always managed so discreetly that nobody could tell from whence it came but by guess Gra∣titude however constantly gave the act to its right owner and thus was our hero frequently slandered for his benevolence for was it not plain that the person so befriended might have starved in prison but for the beauty of his wife or his daughterthough for aught they knew one might be blind and the other deformed  Charles foresaw that he should incur a good deal  of this slander and indeed he was obliged to take an extraordinary step at the outset to avoid the im∣possibility of carrying on his scheme without the total ruin of his reputation This was to admit no women who were arrested lest wretches void of honour should be sent there upon either real or imaginary actions to the discredit of the houseIt is true many of these things were attempted but when they were peremptorily informed that there was no sort of accommodation they soon desisted and this as much as any thing kept away sharpers for they can herd only with women of the above description  Thus was this asylum appropriated according to its original institution to men under misfortune only It wore a sober decent appearance and in∣stead of riot extravagance gambling and profli∣gacy it exhibited a society of people in distress it is true but profiting by each other's advice and as∣sistance Women of credit and reputation were not ashamed to be seen there and the consolation of near and tender relations was never interrupted by rude and brutal intimidations nor was any opportunity ever lost of cheering the wretched and softening the sufferings of the unfortunate  In the mean time a number of unpleasant at∣tempts  were made to destroy this desirable asylum for the afflicted Bailiffs make fortunes in two ways by either carrying a man to their houses and so spunging upon him till he is drained of all his money or else by taking a compliment as they call it in proportion to the sum for which he is ar∣rested and then taking his word that is to say letting him go Now it happened that our hero's plan so trenched upon this first method that they were obliged oftener than had been their custom to have recourse to the second Thus being obliged to trade upon an unusual risk several of them who did not properly know their men came into scrapes and nothing among them was talked of but motions of court suspensions and other unseasonable mat∣ters which made them look about them in earnest for they plainly saw that if Charles's asylum was found to be of public utility and taken up upon a larger plan bailiffs might even return to their for∣mer vocations of knights of the post bullies to bawdy houses thieftakers and runners to gaols  With a number of such low enemies against him no wonder if our hero met with a thousand insults It will not however be so necessary for me to spin out trifling matters as to enumerate them He never failed to put the law severely in force against them whenever they infringed their duty and as to any  thing else he held it beneath him to notice itBut now a matter of serious consequence indeed happened to him He was one evening arrested for three thousand pounds Supposing this some manoeuvre that he could easily get rid of to the confusion of the tribe of the catch poles he insisted upon going to his own house of security but this favour was peremptorily denied him with an in∣formation that the officer who kept it was sus∣pended for that he had connived at the escape of a person who had been confined there for a debt of three thousand pounds that the sheriff had been fixed for the debt and now came upon him as one of the securities  In short the fellow who had so long kept his credit with our hero in the execution of his trust as sheriff's officera post as we have seen that may be filled with reputationafter having been a long time tampered with and yet resisting every temptation was at last overcome  A swindler owed virtually to one man a thou∣sand pounds but literally three thousand The cir∣cumstance is worth attending to This one man was a rascally attorney found out by a set of as ras∣cally bailiffs who were determined to knock up  Charles's plan He sent for the swindler asked him the amount of all his debts and was informed they were something more than three thousand pounds He was then desired to inform himself whether they could not be paid with a thousand  This enquiry was made and it was found they could for he had no creditor but would be glad to take a third for the whole seeing they stood no other chance of getting any  Before any further step was taken the security of Charles's factotum was tampered withat first distantlywho appearing not very shy as they called it was at length plainly informed how he might touch a thousand pounds In short finding him apt they proposed if he could prevail on the officer to connive at an escape they should receive a thousand pounds each The affairs of the security were going down and he had no doubt but he should induce his friend to consent In short the scruples of both were at length overcome  This being accomplished the swindler's debts were paid with a thousand pounds the attorney re∣ceived documents which made him appear to stand in the shoes of the creditors to the amount of three  thousand pounds For this sum was the swindler arrested for this sum was the sheriff fixed in con∣sequence of his escape and for this sumafter the factotum and his security were paid their money and fairly put into a post chaisewas our hero four days in custody at the end of which time rather inconveniently he paid the money and procured his enlargement  Thus did the attorney who was ostensible for the bailiffs receive the original money they had ad∣vanced bribe their agent with double that sum procure the swindler's liberty and all at Charles's expencewho now saw it would be utterly impos∣sible for him to carry his humane plan any far∣ther  Bigoted however to his project and having seen the best effects from it he waited on men of larger fortune with a view to advise with them how to perfect an undertaking of such material utilityHe exposed the conduct of it with the minutest nicety and shewed how much money as well as happiness he had been the instrument of restoring to his fellow creatures in distress  Unfortunately he was disappointed in every ap∣plicationfor  finding after a critical statement of the accounts that he had at no time made seven per cent of his moneyindeed he did not make more than four for he inserted none of those ex∣pences to be laid to the account of his benefac∣tionshe could not find a single creature to engage in it  His last application was to the sheriffs but their answer was that they had no notion of putting the business out of the common channel and indeed they were no friends to the scheme for it had in∣jured the emoluments of their office by preventing the accumulation of arrests Nay they had heard men in power hint that it was an idle meddling scheme and among other public inconveniences it had decreased the stamp duty  As the limits of our hero's fortune would not permit him to become security again for a person to manage the house and as it would answer no end to let it to a thorough bred sheriff's officer he was obliged to drop the affair lamenting that his circumstances were so straitened that he could not carry it to that perfection he wished and feeling severely for the dignity of human nature when he reflected that in all his researches he had not  been able to transfer benevolence upon the easy terms of good pecuniary interest sweetened with the benedictions of the unfortunate  CHAPTER V  MORE SCHEMING UPON A SANDY FOUNDATION AN UNJUST TRIAL AND CONVICTION AND ONE EXULTATION QUASHED BY ANOTHER  THAT I may carry our hero the whole length of his tether while I am about it I shall proced to plan the third though it must be observed that these schemes were all in agitation at once so full of vivacity were his actions when he panted to succour his fellow creatures  This third scheme went to the relief of the poor at large and indeed so did the fourth One was a plan to sell them bread under the standard price and the other meat  To carry the first into execution a watermill was built and a bakehouse annexed to it The matter was found very practicable the original money yielded at least six per cent and the poor even then were served with better bread and saved  at least a penny out of every sixpence Nothing could be more simple nor more effective The sparring of the bakers was more easily kept within bounds than that of the bailiffs Indeed as our hero meant to make his expences the ground of a memorial for the better regulation of so material an article his competitors were rather inclined to con∣ciliate than aggravate matters  The scheme for regulating the price of meat could not be conducted in a manner so within himself as the other He therefore could not avoid connecting himself with a grazier and a butcher In the choice of these he used every precaution his most watchful and diligent prudence could suggest  At length having settled the matter to his mind the plan was began and carried on for some time with astonishing success though he could not re∣strain his partners from making more interest for their money than he wished yet with these and many other clogs upon it the advantages to the poor were considerable The forestallers however at last so harassed and inconvenienced the concern that in about seven weeks after the hospitable asy∣lum was put down our hero had the mortification to see his name in the Gazette as partner of Daniel  Driver and Anthony Garbage graziers butchers dealers and chapmen  We have seen the young gentleman in a state of astonishment before how he felt at this intelligence we can the readier conceive But still his situation varied a little from the rest He never saw himself before upon the brink of poverty However after the first shock he received great consolation from the consciousness of his own good intentions and he contented himself with only adding to the first transport of his indignationwhich was pretty vio∣lentthat men were wolves and vultures and that the greatest act of madness a man could be guilty of was an attempt to civilize them  The first step he took was an endeavour to super∣sede the bankruptcy as far as related to himself upon a plea that he was able to satisfy his own cre∣ditors by paying twenty shillings in the pound  Poor inexperienced young man He little knew that was the worst plea he could offer It availed him nothing His effects were overhauled his mill was sold and after obtaining his certificate in form he found himself possessed of no more than between three and four hundred pounds  Thus were overthrown all our projector's hopes which though they certainly were a system of re∣form utterly beyond his ability to mature yet he surely merited no reproach for having made such a laudable attempt  As I have already observed there never was per∣haps an instance of a welldisposed young man who was in so trying a way let alone entirely to the bent of his own disposition That disposition evidently led him to alleviate the wants of his fellow crea∣tures If in this he aimed at more than he could accomplish let it be attributed to a liberal ex∣panded propensity to confer benefits a noble giv∣ing beneficent principle of action which must be endowed in an uncommon degree with courageous generosity to risk in supplying the wants of others the existence of that source from which those wants were supplied  As to the vehicles through which this benevolence was dispensed they certainly wanted riper experi∣ence more consequence and a larger fund to ma∣nage them for as it was our hero's conductespecially as to his two first schemeswas a sort of Quixotism in liberality But yet had the folly been ten times more egregious it was still but folly whereas the intention in so young a man so  unadvised so left to his own propensities requires a word to express its deserts much stronger than any dictionary will give us and which one might have an idea of by fancyingif one could do so without violating languagesomething that implied a mean∣ing about ten times as expressive as the superlative degree of admirable  Nine out of ten however reviled Charles's con∣duct in the most humiliating terms He had a hundred nick names He was the infant Her∣cules the mad projector the opulent beggar the beneficent catchpole Timon in tatters and ninetyfive other things all as good as these But in the midst of this it must have mortified his ene∣mies to death and raised the praise of all good men to that very unspeakable degree of admiration I mentioned in the last paragraph had they accom∣panied the gradual decline of his circumstances with remarks on his becoming conduct and then seen how he sat himself down in adversity  When first he returned to England he had an elegant house and kept his carriage The moment he was out of parliament he sold off his carriage took a smaller house and lived more privately till step by step we now see him only decently lodged with an old gentlewoman who had been  his housekeeper for his only attendant Yet did every sixpence of those superfluities he curtailed go to relieve the distressed for it was his constant method to retreat in time that so nothing might be spared to accomplish his great and liberal pur∣poses  There is something also beautiful and I hope it so strikes the reader in reflecting that when Charles was driven to the necessity of discarding all his servants but one he should retain the oldest and most helpless among the number and to finish this picture if it has so far interested the reader let it melt him into friendly generous sympathy when I heighten it by bringing on a grateful honest group of now happy objects through the means of his beneficence lamenting the state to which alone his compassionate generosity had reduced him vent∣ing their admiration of a mind so charitable yet so young invoking benedictions on his head for the benefits they had themselves through him and from his hands received and conjuring him to accept their thankful mite for his present assistance  I can only say that no glutton ever sat down to a banquet with half the satisfaction that Charles felt at this sight He thanked them with tears assured  them that his situation was a trifling concern since it had mended theirs that he had resources and so little repented of what had past that had he again fifteen thousand pounds he would give it with pleasure to have the charming satisfaction of enjoying such another moment  During all this time our hero's correspondence with Annette went on variously Sometimes Emma was obliged to be extremely cautious and at other times all caution was altogether as unnecessaryThis happened just as Charles rose or sunk in the opinion of Sir Sidney who had reallyfinding him such an originalwatched his conduct with great attention  In parliament he had remarked that though there was great singularity in it there was also great con∣sistency and what was better great integrityand much about the time when Emma adjusted the correspondence between the lovers was really in∣clined to think that he had been wronged or that he had the strangest mixture of good and ill quali∣ties in him that ever was heard of when Mr Gloss contrived while Sir Sidney's sentiments were in this equipoise to make our hero's virtues kick the beam with a single fillup  In short he had then as usual an opportunity of turning one of his good actions into the appear∣ance of a very bad one and he had no doubt but by this means he should be able to make the ba∣ronet's dubious thoughts preponderate on the side that would be least to Charles's advantage  Gloss took the very first opportunity that he heard Sir Sidney say any thing tending to Charles's praise of remarking that good men were always the most easy to be imposed upon and in this he said very true for he was then going to impose upon Sir Sid∣ney He followed this declaration up with ano∣ther expressing his great reluctance that it should fall to his lot to bring forward accusations conti∣nually against Mr Hazard and in particular lest the censorious worldfor he was sure Sir Sidney would do him more justiceshould think he had a farther interest in such conduct than mere impar∣tial justice and a desire that a gentleman so dear to him and indeed to the world in general should undeceive himself in an opinion undeservedly enter∣tained of one who not only plunged himself every day into some fresh vice but indeed seemed to set shame and even decency at defiance He insisted that benevolence extended to bad objects was a sort of crime it was a tacit admission though not approval of their conduct and might in men to  whom the world looked up as it did to Sir Sidney for example be so construed He took the liberty to add that if his dear friend had a foiblethough to be sure it was amiable in the extremethis was it  In short after a proper dose of gilded flattery he informed the baronet that it was then a week since our hero had turned a poor wretch whom he had seduced from her friends into the streets with all the shocking circumstances of shame and wretchedness The way he came to the truth of this was the miserable creature hearing he was one of Mr Hazard's friends had called upon him and related the whole shocking business with such simplicity and apparent truth that he had been in∣duced to relieve her and intended visiting her fa∣ther to try if he could not prevail on him to re∣ceive his repentant child into the bosom of her fa∣mily  Sir Sidney seemed greatly shocked with this story and upon Mr Gloss's repeated entreaty consented not only to see this unhappy girl but to use his interest with her father who was it seems a substantial tradesman to take her back again  Not to let the matter cool the baronet saw the  young lady was afterwards introduced to a person who kept wine vaults in Petty France who con∣fessed himself her father and had the good fortune after using a variety of arguments first to prevail on him to see and afterwards forgive the reclaimed sinner to whom Sir Sidney presented one fifty pounds and Mr Gloss another accon panied with good counsel in some men's estimation to fifty times that value  The story the young lady told Sir Sidney was briefly this that Charles had taken uncommon pains to seduce her but being tired with possession had now turned her off that she verily believed dearly as she loved him and ever should his prin∣cipal motive in a connection with her was interest This the gentleman in Petty France believed too for he assured Sir Sidney that when she went off she carried two hundred pounds with her But the lady said had he found his account in this expec∣tation she did not think she should have kept him long for she soon found that he had fallen in love with a girl whose mother he had taken out of a spunging house and this she said was so true that the mother lived with him at that time in quality of housekeeper and the daughter was put out to a milliner in a house where she was to be taken in  partnership when her apprenticeship should be ex∣pired  Many circumstances were adduced to prove the truth of these allegations and as far as it related to our hero's protestations though they were but in general terms there was enough under his hand∣writing which Sir Sidney knew to corroborate his connection with her and parting from her par∣ticularly the latter in which the baronet thought he discovered a remarkable vein of cruel and in∣sulting levity  I believe it is scarcely necessary to add that the lady was Miss Newton that she had been tutored by Gloss that the man at the wine vaults was oc∣casionally a convenient friend of hers that these two divided Sir Sidney's bounty and gave Gloss's back again This admitted our hero's letters will not appear extraordinary especially the last at which the baronet was so incensed which accom∣panied the hundred pounds he sent her the day af∣ter he had detected her and as it happened ac∣cording to the partial construction now put upon it to apply so directly in favour of the lady by exhibiting a want of feeling in the gentleman I shall here insert it  The reader will keep in mind that the gentle∣man's name was Nantz who kept the wine vaults  TO MISS N  Being so well set up in a business by which as long as your youth lasts you can get a good main∣tenance you will the less regret my leaving you I dare say I need not advise you to make your market while you can Do so and welcome for there is no future comfort I do not wish you so it be not procured at the expence of  CHARLES HAZARD  The reader who is with me in the secret will find this letter quite delicate It laughs off a very great injury it is besides in a style well adapted to the person to whom it is addressed and there is something very delicate in the circumstance of taking no notice of what it enclosed We however must commend Sir Sidney and had we been as he was ignorant of the real truth we should have thought as he did  It must be confessed that in spight of Gloss's moderation Sir Sidney exulted a little at this story  He came home full of it and as he had seen Charles's handwriting and besides nobody could think of doubting his veracity even Emma herself was for the present unprepared or at least ap∣peared so to defend her favourite which indeed vexed her not a little because she had just got the correspondence in such a nice train She contented herself therefore with saying that it had been said there were two ALEXANDERS one invincible the son of PHILIP the other inimitable the production of APELLES At present it might be said there were two Mr Hazards one good and benevolent represented by the world the other vile and diabo∣lical painted by Mr Gloss That for her part she did not approve of premature condemnations they were generally repented of They had not yet heard both sides of the question except in one instance where Mr Hazard was cleared greatly to his honour She said she should not have scrupled to disbelieve the whole of this business but for the circumstance of the letters With that proof she should rest contented for Sir Sidney had the evi∣dence of his own senses to go upon She wished most truly he would never credit any thing but through that medium  She allowed the young gentleman had failings nor was it to be wondered at TELEMACHUS though  with Minerva for his guide fell into the errors of his father What must this young man do help∣less and alonewho never had occasion for his friends till he had lost themand how lost them It was not then a moment to investigate that She should therefore say she acquiesced in the truth of our hero's faults but it should be upon this condi∣tion that if he had weakness it was the weakness of an angel  Sir Sidney begged she would retain her good opi∣nion of Mr Hazard it was perfectly consistent with her romantic notions but desired she would not so far make a novel of the business as to let her friendship interfere with her duty  'Sir' said Emma 'if to have your interest ten∣derly at heart be to neglect my duty no duty was ever so neglected'  'Come come' said Gloss 'you need not vaunt your fidelity Mrs Emma till it is disputedwe see what you are'  'It is easily seen' answered Emma very mildly 'what I am and it will one day sir be seen what you are andMr GlossWHO you are'  Sir Sidney would certainly have rebuked Emma very sharply for this strange freedom but that he saw at the instant it was uttered the strongest marks of confusion in the countenance of GlossThese to be sure he endeavoured to pass off by hinting that the liberty Mrs Emma had taken was very extraordinary but this he did so slightlyfearing probably a few more of those choke pearsthat the baronet was assured so significant an expres∣sion would not have been levelled by Emma or received by him in the manner it had were there not something of an extraordinary nature couched under it He thought however the wisest way at present would be to break up the conversation He therefore told Emma he was assured she had the best intentions and begged Mr Gloss would forgive her if any thing she had said in her haste offended him  Gloss took him at his word with great eagerness totally unlike himself and this augmented Sir Sid∣ney's suspicions  CHAPTER VI  CONTAINS AMONG OTHER MATTER A HISTORY WHICH THE READER WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY SEE THE DRIFT OF  Now it happened that had Emma found it con∣venient she could have consuted the whole of this calumny and in a way greatly to our hero's honour but this would have brought up matters which in spight of all her diligence were not yet ripe enough for investigation The fact is that she had made herself not a little uneasy at this very circum∣stance before which she had first learnt through some invidious intimations from Gloss and had very carefully watched the matter till at length her fears were at an end upon our hero's leaving Miss New∣ton owing she had no doubt to the more agree∣able commerce in which she had now engaged him and this roused in her a reflection greatly to his credit for if the bare mention of a correspondence with a woman of honour could induce such a youth to give up a guilty connection unsolicited what might not have been expected from him had his  other pursuits been sanctioned by the advice of sensi∣ble and respectable friends And yet prudence had whispered to Emma that it was certainly but yet barely possible for Charles to have given up Miss Newton in compliment to his housekeeper's daugh∣ter This business therefore she made a point of coming at to do which she visited the old lady one day when our hero as she knew was engaged at his mill about five miles out of town  There was something in this old lady that had be∣fore strongly prepossessed Emma in her favour and as the latter came not out of any improper curio∣sity to make an advantage of any thing she should hear to the other's disadvantage and as the former had never made a secret of the story but on the contrary though against our hero's will taken every opportunity of singing forth his praises by repeating the circumstances of it as far as he had been concerned in it to every one who asked it it will not either surprise the reader to hear that Emma got out of the old gentlewoman the particu∣lars of her whole life or that when she had done so she admired the extraordinary goodness of Charles more than everand here the reader will reflect with double pleasure that this was the very domestic or rather companion he retained in his circum∣stances of adverse fortune  The old lady having first like Othello told her story in parcels Emma begged to have it from her youth up the which to hear did she most seriously incline What she told at length I shall give the reader briefly for I have no time for spinning out narratives  She was the daughter of a gentleman who had a life place in a public office and had been thrown very early in life with a small fortune into the protection of an aunt who unfortunately being a woman of intrigue connived at her ruin Her se∣ducer by whom she had a child was a clergyman but as he soon left her she was compassionated by another relation who took her home obliged the father to take the child which was a boy and got her fortune out of the hands of her aunt  It was not many months before a respectable tradesman paid his addresses to her and in spight of her misfortune offered her his hand nay he was the warmer on that account He knew she had been betrayed by a wicked woman and a sinner in the garb of a saint and therefore wanted a pro∣tector In short they became man and wife and had lived in great credit fiveandtwenty years when falling into difficulties through the villany of some notorious swindlers and innocently getting  the ill will of a pettifogging attorney her husband whose name was Marlow was one of those whose reputation had been totally ruined by vexatious arrests in the way I have already described  Our hero strenuously exerted himself in the poor man's behalf and with great difficultybut not till all his connections scared by this temporary misfortune had deserted himobtained his liberty from a spunging house where he laid thirteen days in a most cheerless condition during which time he was witness to the riotous profligacy of some of those very men who had wilfully caused his misfortunes  The loss of his credit added to a severe cold he had caught by lying in a damp bed threw him into a fever which in spight of every caution hurried him out of the world in a very short time He died recommending his widow and her daughter to the protection of our hero now the only friend he had in the world  The old lady as it has been shewn was appointed Charles's housekeeper and the young one who was the only remaining child out of eleven was put into business exactly in the manner Mr Gloss re∣lated who always made it a rule to keep truth as  much in view as he conveniently could in all his stories  This was the account that Emma had she found it expedient might have opposed to the other to which also she was prepared to add that so far from his having seduced Miss Newton she was not only a notoriously abandoned character but that Mr Gloss knew it She contented herself however with the few hints she had given which she was pleased to find had told just as she wished they should  If Emma was however satisfied for the present I cannot say so much for Sir Sidney who the first time he was alone with his lady asked her freely her sentiments on this subject and in particular how she could account for the freedom of Emma's conduct  Lady Roebuck said he might be assured there was not in existence a more faithful creature that however no duty could induce her to be what she conceived ungrateful or unjust that she had cer∣tainly the highest opinion of Mr Hazard and had set her heart upon his union with Annette but that as his fortune daily diminished and the pretensions of Mr Gloss were daily more and more established  she trembled for her favourite of whom she would not credit any ill till every thing could be estab∣lished by a fair investigation which for her own part seeing neither side was willing to make the first motion she thought would never take place  One great proof Lady Roebuck said both of the attachment of Emma and the delicacy of those sentiments by which she supported it was that though her predelection in favour of Mr Hazard was evident yet she had never used any unbecom∣ing arguments to Annette on the subject but con∣trary to this had always held out that the com∣mands of her fatherwhich only urged her to make an effort to overcome that affection which to be sure the whole family had formerly sanctionedwere very lenient and truly characteristic of the charming mind of a parent who had upon every occasion been remarkable for his indulgence to∣wards his daughter  In this however Lady Roebuck neither told nor knew the truth for Emma privately kept up her affection for Charles and increased her aversion to Gloss  'But' said Sir Sidney 'what meant that strange side accusation of Mr Gloss What did she mean  by saying it would be known who he was Had I not been averse to lower the consequence of a gentleman before a dependant I would have in∣sisted on an explanation of that expression'  Lady Roebuck went on in these words  'My dear Sir Sidney you know with what reluctance I have ever ventured to say a word on this subject I own I have been myself greatly prepossessed in favour of Mr Hazard We all at one time es∣teemed him as a most amiable young man and though we have had what has been thought strong proofs against him yet as Emma says only one side of the question has been heard and I confess from some internal impulse which may per∣haps be the effect of my sanguine wishes for this young gentleman's welfarewhich wishes were inspired by the dying and pathetic request of his mother for whom we had all a tender friend∣shipI cannot yet consent to pronounce him from my own conviction guilty of such very enormous offences which could not be perpe∣trated but by a mind capable of the most hardened and incorrigible wickedness a disposition which is rarely produced suddenly and of which his by what we have seen of it promised exactly the reverse  'While I say this however continued Lady Roe∣buck 'I will not contend how far these feelings are right They may be falsely entertained perhaps impelled by the motives I have men∣tioned while your riper judgment and better know∣ledge of the world have enabled you to form a truer and more decided opinion of the truth in which case it would be strange vanity however right my intentions in entertaining these senti∣ments if I did not as upon all other occasions implicitly submit to yours'  Sir Sidney kissed her perhaps for her obedience said she was a charming creature and desired her to go on  'As to Annette' added Lady Roebuck 'I shall there be still more backward to give either advice or opinion for very many reasons necessarily de∣licate but one is which is the most pleasurable that never was advice to a young tender sensible creature so little needed she is all you can wish from inclination or hope from duty yet I ho∣nestly believe she regards Mr Hazard more warmly than any other person in the world Not however that her prepossession in his favour has made her sentiments to Mr Gloss otherwise than they would have been had she never seen him  She deports herself upon all occasions with that sweet native dignity in which pure unaffected loveliness is sure to be seen and therefore Mr Gloss has had no reason to complain of receiving that portion of her favour which all those com∣mand from her who come sanctioned with the partiality of her father but be assured that at present he is almost the last person in the world she wishes to think of as a husband Yet I will not say that were you so far to exert the authority of a father as to insist upon her marrying him she would refuse for I sincerely believe she has so singular a sense of implicit duty that she would give up her own happiness to promote yoursThis allowed every thing remains well you will never exert so rigorous a duty and she will never take any steps to disoblige you'  'Upon my soul' said Sir Sidney 'it is impos∣sible to hear you without being charmed you have so the knack of smoothing every difficulty It is not wonderful there should be such perfection in Annette when she can look up to you for her example'  'My dear' answered Lady Roebuck 'what∣ever little my assiduity and endeavours have ef∣fected in the blameless and admirablyregulated  conduct of your daughter Emma's care and at∣tention have performed a great deal more That good that astonishing creature makes virtue the most endearing thing in the world and contrives to give its attractions a winning cheerfulness that induces its performance not more as a duty than as a familiar and enchanting pleasure Much more yet however is owing to Annette herself the sweetness of whose unaffected manners the gaiety of whose angelic dsposition and the un∣sullied purity of whose charming mind anticipate every attempt to inspire goodness for where should we find virtue but in its abode'  'All this only convinces me' said the baronet 'that I ought to consider myself the happiest hus∣band and father in the world As to Emma I readily believe her a prodigy of honour and in∣tegrity All I have to find fault with is that she is often unnecessarily zealous and that her virtue is now and then a little too outrageous One in∣stance of this we have recently seen and I should be glad to know if you can possibly give a guess at what she would be at for I must confess I have an anxious desire to know and yet am very unwilling to resort to her for intelligence there∣fore as you saw I put an end to the conversa∣tion'  'My dear Sir Sidney' said Lady Roebuck 'I own I am not sorry for this opportunity of saying what I think is Emma's opinion of Mr Gloss on the contrary I shall take the liberty of follow∣ing it with my own  'Emma thinks Mr Gloss a man of great talents but having discovered in him a specious plausi∣bility which she says men of independant cir∣cumstances or principles are never under the ne∣cessity of having recourse to she will insist upon it he is not an eligible match for Annette  'There is a mystery an obscurity in the very best accounts we have learnt concerning him that leaves his qualities with Emma in a very negative situation and inclines her to think he will one day or other be found an impostor It has been urged that your correspondent at Madeira gives him the character of an able man of business says he was a merchant first at Lisbon and afterwards at Madeira and that he profusely spent a large fortune He himself since says he received a handsome sum on account of his father's affairs and that a much larger remains unpaid but that India matters are slow and insecure But Emma opposes to this quaintly but smartly enough that suppose they were fast and certain would  they tell in his favour against his monstrous debts On account of which she insinuates it was well he secured himself a seat in parliament At the same time she does not deny but his external con∣duct is perfectly blameless and that he has openly a number of engaging and valuable qualities but she suspects that half these are put on and accounts for this suspicion under an idea that it is his study to render himself agreeable by adminis∣tering to that passion he sees most predominant in the person he would play upon Thus he knows with you he cannot have a recommendation like generosity and benevolence and in the exercise of these though but in appearance he insures himself a place in your esteem And these truths for truths she will have them to be are the more strongly rooted in her mind by a firm belief that all we have heard against Mr Hazard originates from him  'Now I grant there is an air of extravagance in these conjectures nevertheless though chequered by strong predelection and being but one con∣jecture hazarded againd another probability is not one moment neglected The very best ac∣counts of him call him a man of unbounded ex∣travagance which surely has close relation to profligacy Then if he is in debt as much as the  world says were he tomorrow out of parliament he must be totally without fortune in which case would he be an eligible husband for An∣nette  'As to his accommodating disposition which Emma is so angry at he will not practice it with much success upon you who know the world or it would be very hard full as well as Mr Gloss and for the article of his practices against Mr Hazardwhich I confess I hardly know how not to admitit would be an ungentlemanlike advan∣tage which I am sure you would be the first to resent  'In short Emma thinks him an impostor who will one day or other be found out and for my own part I wish his condu  was a little less equi∣vocal though under these or any other circum∣stances I fear no surprise from him or any other while you are upon your guard'  Sir Sidney having heard his good lady to an end thanked her for her very kind sensible mild and considerate speech which he said had nothing new or uncommon in it from her but was only one of those innumerable instances which he had received of the sweet benevolence of her gentle nature It  seemed however to demand something on his part and he should answer it he hoped perfectly to the purpose  He began by admitting that Mr Gloss's account of himself at first sight was equivocal but how∣ever we must not say a thing is false because we could not prove it true Mr Gloss's father ap∣peared to be an obscure character but there was nothing new in that among people who made for∣tunes in India The young gentleman had certainly been extravagant he had now however retrenched and lived within bounds That there was to be sure something in the report of his being in debt for he had himself given him a faithful account of it but the money coming from India would satisfy all those matters and leave a handsome surplus That as to his good qualities they were something more than external the assistance he had given to Castle∣wick which was richer and much more extensive through his advice and exertions was a proof of it But he had other qualities other talents which among liberal men were paramount to either birth or fortune and ranked him preeminently among those whose names were transmitted to posterity He had all that was necessary to make a consum∣mate statesman and he had no doubt but the period was not far distant when he would be seen to adorn  one of the first situations under governmentWhen this should be the case no objection could possibly lie against him and he owned he should then be sorry to hear his daughter refuse him for a husband  As to any practices of his against the reputation of Mr Hazard they certainly existed only in Mrs Emma's imagination for it had been his uniform practice to defend that unfortunate young gentle∣man as long as truth and reason would permit him but when proofs came so thick that a man must be blind not to see them he like every body else was obliged to yield to conviction  As to Mr Hazard every thing he did was ab∣surdity and illjudged profusion He was at that moment engaging in schemes which could not be effected by men of immense fortune and immense influence and what was worse under the colour of munificence the view was profit In short with a few thousands he was in more ways than one new modelling customs which had been long cor∣dially received and well established and that the consequence of this dream of riches and popularity would be his waking probably in a few months a  beggar in which case could he be called an eligi∣ble husband for Annette  As to the variety of crimes laid to his charge he would agree that but one side had been heard but whose fault was it Why did he not if his cause would bear it defend himself Why truly he chose to take the matter in dudgeon to look highly and feel himself offended because people chose to believe what they heard This might be a good cloak to hide a weak plea but did not at all look like innocence which so far from fearing in∣vestigation he said always sought it  Had any thing like this been seen in Mr Ha∣zard So sar from seeking the smallest explanation had he not industriously shunned all such opportu∣nities Nay was he not so conceitedly proud so ridiculously vain when he had been supposedfor to this moment it was not a certaintyto have be∣haved generously as to reject with contempt the acknowledgement of this imaginary kindness and disclaim the friendship of the man he would fain be thought to have obliged  Upon the whole he said these were his ideas that in a worldly point of view Mr Gloss was in∣finitely  a preferable husband for Annette His talents were brilliant he was himself very popular and would most probably one day be in a most ele∣vated situation On the contrary Mr Hazardwhose talents also were very conspicuous and whose accomplishments were not inferior to any man'sby a perverse pride and false consequence would every day become lower in the world's opi∣nion till he found himself starving with indepen∣dant principles  'However' said Sir Sidney 'you have named yourself the compact and I subscribe to it while I find Annette obedient I shall not be unreasonable In the interim as I sincerely believe that Mr Gloss will certainly be possessed of both honour and fortunemore perhaps than I have a right to expect in a soninlawI desire he may be considered in the light of one whom I have chosen to fill that character'  This retrospective chapter shews how matters stood in Sir Sidney's family about the time Charles began to be a projector from which moment to that in which his name appeared in the Gazette he gradually sunk in the opinion of the baronet for through the connivance of the forestallers of law and beef his name was bandied about in the newspapers like a tennis ball in which inoffensive  amusement Mr Gloss was not idle but when the Whereas made its appearance and the title of butcher was added to our hero's name I sincerely believe had there been no such man as Mr Gloss or indeed no other than Charles Annette might have died a virgin or married without her father's consent  As to Emma she entered into all the spirit of our hero's schemes with enthusiasm She declared it folly and ignorance to condemn them that the very enemies they begat were the strongest proofs of their utility that they evinced a nobleness of soul beyond all example in so young a man and that if Castlewick was a molehill in the scale of liberality Charles's projects were a mountain  In shortand I cannot help thinking with herEmma saw so large so benificent so admirable a system of general good in them that nothing but the envy of individuals and the degeneracy of the public could prevent their arriving to that maturity which would perpetuate the projects and the pro∣jector  Emma greatly feared however the success of that scheme that went to cure the abuses of the law  'for well' said she 'did Pope Pius the Second observe that those who go to law are the birds that the court is the field that the judges are the net and the lawyers the fowlers'  CHAPTER VII  CONTAINS LOVE LETTERS CHIMERICAL SPECULATIONS AND SOME HINTS CONCERNING PROFESSIONAL CAMELIONS  I shall now return to Charles who that he might understand the extent of not only his pos∣sessions but his expectations received the day af∣ter he became a free man an account that his noble brother was blest with an heir to his title and es∣tate  As our hero had long accustomed himself to look up to no one for assistance he now saw the abso∣lute necessity of sitting down without embarrass∣ment to consider in what way he should make his talents turn out to his advantag To do this he looked his situation full in the face and immedi∣ately with a sigh of affection and regret blest the remembrance of that provident father who had seemed to have foreseen this moment and armed him against it His pen had already been cele∣brated in the highest terms of panegyric His pen∣cil  had procured him very lavish encomiums even from the most flourishing artists and his talent for music was allowed not to be inferior to either of the others He therefore thought it hard if he could not live independantly when he had three such re∣sources At the same time he knew that to become a public man he must condescend and in order to do so all former high prejudices and perspective notions of situation and opulence must be con∣quered for though the public was a noble and liberal master yet his would be at best a situation of mental servitude  His next idea was how he should render his abi∣ties worthy of such an illustrious patronage and the result of this reflection became naturally a reso∣lution to produce works of general utility such as would promote the cause of genius and literature and were dear to the interests of virtue and mora∣lity  And now to wean himself from all vain expecta∣tions His first effort was an adieu to Annette which would have been poetry but that there was too much of the heart in it to be dressed in the garb of fiction There was so much pure feeling in∣deed noble selfdenial and exalted love in it that it took but a few minutes to write it The anguish  of that short time could scarcely be repaid by an age of happiness It was like tearing the vitals and Emma when she read it declared that the agony of the young Spartan was nothing to it for the reader sees the difficulty was to bear the tor∣ment yet give the consolation This was the letter  TO MISS ROEBUCK  THIS letter best of creatures is supported by the strongest proof I ever yet gave you of my love I am no longer in a situation to look up to you and therefore must think no more of that happiness which can never be mine Let our re∣solution to part be mutual and worthy that affec∣tion which has no example but which fate will not indulge  Your love charming Annette equals mine but your task is easier You have a thousand consolations to which I am a stranger yet I rea∣dily set you an example which it would diminish the glory of your sentiments not to follow Imi∣tate me willingly Let your lovewhich had made up the perfection of your characterin the  very moment while your heart yields to the dio∣tates of your duty approve the noble resolution Ours were fond expectations providence has thought fit to disappoint them Let us not mur∣mur then but retain those mutual good wishes as friends which we must not cherish as lovers  Adieu Fail not to let your resolution be like mine cool calm and collected so shall my An∣nette be additionally lovely to the soulthough fortune has denied her to the armsof her  CHARLES HAZARD  I will not say that these lines cost so little trouble to the mind of our hero as they appear to express for indeed he felt in proportion as he endeavoured to conceal his feelings This was the processMrs Marlow brought him pen ink and paperhe sat downwrote his letterread it overen∣closed it to Emmadirected itkissed itgave it to a porterassured Mrs Marlow he never was so pleased in his lifeand then fell off the chair upon the ground in a state of insensibility  In short all the tricks of his French delirium and perhaps consumption would probably have  succeeded this event had he not received the next morning the following letter from Annette  TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ  To induce my admiration of the excess of your love and the delicacy of your sentiments the terrible though tender proof you gave me yesterday was unnecessary  Ah Charles have you no other argument to cure me of affection Must I forget you only be∣cause you prove yourself every day more worthy to be rememberedand can honour be so cruel as to require a sacrifice of my happiness at the shrine of what the world calls justice But your virtue should be more resolute than mine which is feminine and has and ought to have its weak∣ness therefore learn I cannot obey you in this one hard injunction though it would be the pride of my life to submit to every other I will never cease to love you command me how you may I will be faithfully affectionately uniformly yours and as my father has promised me he will never insist upon my marrying any man I cannot love so you will plainly see I can never marry  any other than yourself So far however I agree with you that at present it will be improper to continue our correspondence for what length of time fortune knows best This however I know that it is both to my interest and my happiness to declare even to the whole world as firmly as I do to you that be your fortune what it may I shall ever be unalterably  Your own ANNETTE  The reader may judge what sort of cordial this letter proved to a lover who had been alternately shivering with low spirits or raving in a fever the whole night The faithful Mrs Marlow saw the progress of this medicine with tears of gratitude and our hero after reading it ten times kissing it five hundred and imploring all the angels in hea∣ven to bless and protect so much beauty and good∣ness mustered up spirits enough to turn his mind again towards his affairs  Charles had upon two former occasions sent pictures to the royal academy as an honorary ex∣hibiter When he attended the dinner upon St Luke's day he received from the president and se∣veral of the members the most extravagant marks  of applause He thought therefore he could not do a more eligible thing than to begin his scientific career by sending a couple of pictures to the next exhibition with a modest price affixed to them by way of advertisement that he meant in future to resort to painting among other things for a main∣tenance  The pictures were accompanied by a respectful letter to the presidentwho he doubted not would do him justiceintreating to be considered in future as a common and not an honourary exhibiter  This done he waited with impatience for the success of his stratagem The exhibition was ad∣advertised our hero received his ticket of admission and repaired to the place where for twenty mi∣nutes he could not find either of his pictures He tumbled over the catalogue which eased him of half his fearfor he had fancied they were both rejectedby informing him that one of his perfor∣mances was certainly in some part of one of the rooms Vainly however did he search for a consi∣derable while till at length being upon the point of giving the matter up elevating his sight in a nook close to the skylight he fancied he had dis∣covered the object of his perquisition  The picture however was scarcely known to him though he had painted it for one single streak of light fell upon it at the right hand corner at the top which gleamed towards the centre where it rested in a speck while a sudden shadow occa∣sioned by the projection of the chimney piece cut it across from the left hand corner at top to the right hand corner at bottom forming an angle with one half of the frame In short it had exactly the effect of a looking glass badly painted in a cham∣ber scene for the theatre which idea must occur to every reader  This was not all Had either of the pictures been seen alone it could not possibly have had the smallest effect for they appertained to each other like ques∣tion and answer Charles therefore saw it was an affront and was more strongly confirmed in this when he found his other picture tossed about with a hole in it Upon an application for redress he was told he might take away his daubings if he dis∣liked their situation  Charles could not conceive how it could happen that professors of a liberal art knew so little of the manners of gentlemen but since he found it so he resolved to shew them he could right himself  even with the very tool for which they seemed so to despise him  To effect this he painted a picture to which was annexed this explanation  A sovereign prince in a certain country had built a palace to decorate which various poten∣tates contributed many costly presents One a∣mong the rest sent a collection of pictures all the works of eminent artists That these might be distributed in advantageous situations the prince sent for the heads of the royal academy to perform that task as their judgment should direct them  After fixing several according to their distinction which indeed gave but little trouble for they were all as it appeared labelled they came to one about which they could not find this mark of distinction and therefore concluding that the picture was of no value they condemned it to be placed in the temple of Cloacina  Our hero's picture represented the academecians marching with the picture in solemn procession to put the above sentence in execution The most ac∣tive among them were those with whom he had  the greatest reason to be offended and the like∣nesses were so strong that it was impossible to mis∣take them But to crown the joke he introduced a portrait of himself in the foreground holding up the label they had vainly searched foron which was written GUIDO  This picture he exhibited in an auction room hired for the purpose and for a time it actually drew away the company from the exhibition of the artists  He became immediately known and might have had some practice at portrait painting but find∣ing it impossible to make people handsome enough he forewent this most servile of all mental drudgery and declared altogether for pieces of thought and fancy in which he found his genius more gratified These however nobody understood and they re∣mained unsold A picture dealer or two offered to treat for them provided he would smoak them and varnish them repeatedly till they were all over cracks for in that case they would give them new names and pass them upon the public es∣pecially if there were a few holes burnt in the drapery or an eye poked out of the principal figure  This kind of servile imposition however our hero did not chuse to submit to and his pictures went unsold  Charles had become slightly acquainted with a young artist who appeared very anxious that he should push his fortune and informed him there was but one way which was portrait paintingCharles told him he had practised it without suc∣cess  'Ay but you did not go the right way to work' answered the other 'It is not painting a lady's likeness will do you understand meyou must favour a lady with a living likeness if you wish to do any good In short if the painter be young and handsomeand dam'me if I think either you or I frightfula lady sits to him with a view that he should make love to her And then such opportunities Please my dear ma'am to look at memore full if you pleaseyour eyes more languishingnow bite your under lip to pout itsmile if you pleasevery well Pray don't you think as this is a fancy dress that shoulder should be barea part of the neck seenthe rest throbbing as it were through the handkerchief Permit me to adjust it Heavens what a skinwhat roundnesswhat tints The Venus of Titian was plaster to  it In short in adjusting her handkerchief her bosom throbs in good earnest she takes you to her arms and your labours become real nature instead of imitative'  Charles laughed heartily at this description and then resuming a more serious air asked if there were any instances of these sort of amours  'Indeed there are' answered the other 'Gen∣teel young fellows never need be without them and it is their own faults if they do not snap up fortunes But they are a set of stupid block∣heads without manner or address and when they conceive an idea of that sort they generally come into disgrace It was but the other day a foolish brother of the brush made his declaration too prematurelyfor you know my dear sir there is a manner a delicacy in such mattersand was kicked out of the house for his pains Master Musquito though was a little too cunning Ay he is a dry hand'  'Musquito' said Charles 'What Musquito'  'Why you know well enough' said the other' 'Sir Sidney used to invite him to his house Don't you know what has happened to him Upon se∣cond  thoughts it must have happened while you were in France Only married to a woman of seven thousand a year that is all Ay ay they may talk of poets writing themselves into a lady's good graces or a musician tickling their ears but I say the painter is the man to succeed He situates the zones of his Venuses he festoons the petticoats of his buskined Dianas hein short no man except a footman or a dancing master is so sure of success if he minds his hits'  'Well I hope you will mind yours' said Charles 'but this you tell me of Musquito is astonishing'  'It is very true I assure you' answered the other 'That sour crab that sloe that green medlar that cutlemon of a fellow has made a handsome woman's mouth water to the tune of seven thou∣sand a year But Lord you know nothing of what our old codgers are Do you think the nymphs who are drawn every evening come merely for the improvement of the young students No such thing They are procured for the recreation of the old ones I promise you But this is all well enough Let them live in luxury and abuse the royal bounty as much as they like but do not let them now they are past it themselves check the fair progress of young fellows like us who are endeavouring to push ourselves forward in the  world by the laudable exercise of our industry'  'And all its adventitious consequences' said Charles 'among which you reckon of course our chance with the ladies'  CHAPTER VIII  MORE EXPECTATIONS AND MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS  WE have seen the same mind in our hero as to revenge ever since we first noticed him If he aimed at punishing others it was with a view to general justice Certainly there could not be any thing more unhandsome than for a set of men esta∣blished in their profession and established only for the purpose of giving novices their countenance and support to neglect the productions of a young man who was likely to ornament a liberal art and not only artfully conceal his merits but disjoint its ef∣fect so as had it been seen it could not have been understood  Their comment on his satirical picture was that matters were come truly to a fine pass if a young inexperienced dauber could dare to attack a royal corporation in such an audacious manner and then have the insolence by implication to call himself a GUIDO  Our hero however defended himself against this by saying that he did not profess painting and very likely should never take up a pencil again but as the picture told well with the public through the medium of those striking likenesses it contained he might modestly enough take to himself some little merit and as to the name of GUIDO it was evidently a stroke at their ignorance and not a mark of his own vanity for it did not say they are hiding my picture in a certain place though it has the merit of GUIDO but they are hiding GUIDO himself and this also says I forgive you for that neglect which originated from your ignorance for if you have served GUIDO in that manner why should I repine at being coupled with so great a painter  From the moment Charles set out as an artist he guarded against all consequences by supplying himself at his leisure moments with materials for forwarding his interest in every branch he professed Thus he had scarcely sent his pictures to the ex∣hibition but he considered how he might make music turn to account He could not buckle to teaching music any more than to portrait painting for he plainly saw that none but the packhorses of music stood a chance in this branch Such as could exalt claws into a fine finger find sweet tones in a  dissonant squall in short submit to all the ignorant conceited airs of wirebreaking young Misses flatter their mammas dandle the younger children upon their knees deliver written appointments for assig∣nations which were sometimes directed to them∣selves and such other kind of drudgery as appends to the duty of these under servants these scrubers and scullions of the muses  As to the theatre he had gained some little ex∣perience of that before and if in quality of master he was obliged to retire what chance did he stand in quality of servantfor as servants he well knew all those must expect to be treated who wished to give their productions to the public through that medium Then as to publications the country was inundated by Italian and German compositions which obtained patronage through the medium of some man of distinction to whose pleasures the com∣poser administered sometimes in a way that an En∣glishman would starve rather than submit to  In the midst of a variety of cogitations on this subject he was called on by his old friend Toogood who had lately put himself very forward in the mu∣sical world  This son of Apollo told Charles that as he un∣derstood  he had thoughts of devoting himself to the muses for a livelihood he should be happy so serve him in so meritorious a determination He flattered himself he said that as he had got into a conspi∣cuous situation by making his profession subser∣vient to his interest he of all others had it most in his power to point out the only way in music to profit and reputation  Mr Toogood professed a great opinion of our hero's professional abilities and still more of his good sense and knowledge of the world and doubted not as he had smarted severely for his follies that he would now take up and consider that men's talents were given to work out their own advan∣tage  Charles seeing his drift encouraged him to open his whole budget through which he learnt that from his youth he had made it a practice of levying contributions on people of no taste by which means he was become the Apollo or rather the Orpheus of the day that he was looked up to as the regulater of style and leader of fashion in mu∣sic and all this he laid open in a plain narrative of his life and principles without omitting a single circumstance of either his own duplicity or the credulity of his patrons  Having heard him to an end this was our hero's answer  'And so Mr Toogood because you have all your life under the appearance of cringing trim∣ming and many other truckling and wretchedly accommodating shifts vitiated the public taste and scandalized a beautiful and useful art you would have me copy your creeping servilitySir you affront me both as a musician and a gen∣tleman by your unworthy and contemptible pro∣posal It is such as you the world has to thank for introducing mystery and difficulty into the plainest system of rational pleasure the soul of man can receive for setting up an inexplicable stan∣dard to judge of that which is the essence of ease and simplicity No Mr Toogood I despise the servility of your mind as much as I reprobate the fallacy of your doctrines and much as I value popular esteem I should disdain to accept it otherwise than as a tribute to exertions intended to convey rational pleasure and solid advantage'  Charles however did nothing by this sort of conduct but invite enemies But this did not stop him He really could not bridle his resent∣ment To see men pervert the very end of nature's gifts and endeavour to confirm others in error instead of leading them out of it deserved he said reprobation of the severest kind and he was deter∣mined  at least to drag such monstrous impostors into open day and expose their deformities after which it would be the world's fault if such counterfeit coin was suffered to pass current  Charles had yet done but little in the way of pro∣fit Indeed he did not see how he could for it was so dirty a road that he had not the resolution to follow it It became however necessary that he should think of something in good earnest For this purpose he completed an opera which he had had long in contemplation and which he had been repeatedly requested by one of the managers to put the finishing stroke to He sent it and as he knew pretty well the trim of this sort of business his compact was that he would stand or fall by its me∣rits without the interference of any other person This was charming it would have a prodigious run and every attention should be paid it  Our hero called on the manager to consult on the necessary steps to bring it before the public He was still received with great warmth He wished however he would be advised  'In what'  Why suppose he waited upon the editors of the different papers to bespeak favour  'Why If it deserved applause it was to come from the public not the  newspapers If it did not their purchased fa∣vour would be a satire on the performance and an insult to the public'  This was good theory but not practicable Charles said it should be prac∣ticable in his case or nothing should It was ma∣terial to him to come at the truth If he falsely flattered himself and had not abilities for what he had undertaken nothing could be kinder than to undeceive him If he had let his reward come spontaneously from those who he was sure would pay it with interest if it was his due He spoke charmingly it was a pity he did not know what stage conduct was Charles said it was a pity the manager did not know what it ought to be The manager rallied Charles and Charles did not spare the manager who however did not wish to lose the piece of which he had a great opinion  After some necessary matters were settled they parted agreeing that the opera like an act of parliament in a certain stage should be copied for the use of the members  Charles that very evening received a summons to breakfast with the manager the next morning He went and had he not known his man must have been astonished at seeing himself treated with a dis∣tant coolness He had been thinking some of the  passages did not strike him as at first A friend of his Our hero gave him in a few words to un∣derstand that by agreement no friends were to interfere It was very true but the expence of a first piece was a large stake Very likely our hero said and if he felt his promise hang awkwardly upon him he was ready to acquit him of it Oh by no means Well it should be as he pleasedbut did not he think a few alterations  'Not one' said Charles 'If you say a word more about it I will put the piece in my pocket'  In short they parted but barely civil the piece was however left  A few days afterwards they had another meeting The manager was all rapture He begged our hero would not be offended at what was done but indeed it was impossible to be offended He should see  A new copy of the piece was then produced with alterations in the hand writing of four dif∣ferent people whom he knew to be retainers to the house and were the very men and womenfor this was the factwho at that time kept away those real geniuses to whom I have said Charles formerly paid visits of solicitation and nauseated the town with their own insipid trash  Charles cast his eyes over the copy merely to as∣certain this fact and then said  'Sir independant of theatrical business I know no one more a gen∣tleman than yourself Upon theatrical business I never knew a man so pitifully mean Supposing it would answer any good purpose in your wise politics to make a shew of my piece to invite whatever dunce thinks proper to come and blot it do you think sir so contemptibly of me as to suppose I will bear it But putting that out of the question can any thing so strongly evince your ignorance both of theatrical performances and your own interest If I submitted to these alte∣rations would not every individual who made them claim his own feather while I must quietly stand to be plucked and for God's sake what feathers are they Have they made me a bit handsomer So far from it that which was if not superb and magnificent yet neat and decent is now altered into a motley fool's jacket But sir you may take the materials and make them into a cap for your own wear In short I shall trust to your honour not to make use of my ideas to your advantage and as for any thing else I am your humble servant'  The manager however would not let him go He begged him to consider that the scenes were paint∣ing  that he had engaged a singer at a high sa∣lary  'I do not care for that sir' said Charles 'it is dishonourable not to abide by your agreement you had the evidence of your senses  prima facie  you can have no more now What have they de∣cided Why truly that the meanest scribbler in your house is to give laws to me But as I said letting alone that seesaw your own judgment you have done a thing totally against your in∣terest for these poor creatures whose trash cer∣tainly never shall stand a part of the piece losing the merit of having made these alterationswhich by this time they have vaunted to all their friendswill become enemies both to the piece and me so for your caprice I am obliged to wage war with a set of poor reptiles who have not offended me and whom I have no more in∣clination to tread upon than any other worms which searching for food are unlucky enough to come under my feet In short bad as it is for this last time I will overlook this strange con∣duct since you talk of losses which certainly I do not wish you to sustain but I insist that every word shall be expunged which I may not justly claim as my own'  This was at length agreed  to and a morning for the first rehearsal was ap∣pointed  The day came the words were read during which some of the actors as they were instructed yawned at particular passages These were after∣wards to be objected against by the manager which Charles well knowing anticipated by taking him aside and telling him that he saw what he was aim∣ing at but it would not do for that every passage at which the performers had so ill acted the part of yawners should remain without the smallest alte∣ration He said however implicitly the manager might pin his faith upon the sleeve of such opinions he would not wish a better omen of success than an actors entertaining an indifferent opinion of a dra∣matic entertainment for that in general they were men of very slender intellects and mean education who had no opportunity of making worldly obser∣vation but at the porter house or in the green room who had now in tragedy destroyed what was meant for a representation of greatness by stalking like puppets and braying like asses and who had no idea of comedy otherwise than by grinning like apes and chattering like parrots Besides in the present case poor devils it was a repetition of the same miserable farce which had so recently been performed by the authors They were bid to feel  as the others were He wondered therefore that the manager would attempt at treating him so un∣worthily when he knew how ill such former illibe∣rality had been stomached  The patentee was certainly nettled enough at this spirited conduct of our hero He however thought proper to suppress what he felt and they proceeded to the musicroom where every thing was ready for a repetition of the music  The moment Charles entered the room he was surrounded by the females  'Lord Mr Hazard cried one 'don't you think this here round o is monstrous frightful You ought to have given me a song full of divisions and runs and shakes to shew my powers'  'Let us hear it played Miss Forward' said Charles  'Oh Lord' re∣plied the lady 'there is no occasion for that I have played it all over myself with one finger and I tell you it will have no effect'  She was going on with remarks on her other songs but Charles turned from her He was however as badly off for he found the principal singer in high words with the manager because the puppy of a composer had truly thought proper to restrict her in her cadences What did he mean by such inso∣lence  Had any body ever attempted to point out to a mistress of her profession any limits to her candenza  'I know madam' said Charles 'that it is al∣most as vain an attempt as to prescribe limits to her impertinence but in one word those who sing for me shall sing what I have written and nothing else It is my music and not yours I chuse madam to give to the world and to tell you the truth what little abilities I have shall be exerted to explode the candenza which has lately obtained to the scandal of taste and the total ex∣clusion of every characteristic by which music ought to be distinguished As it is singing is be∣come a vehicle to convey every thing that is ex∣traordinary and nothing that is pleasing Na∣ture feeling expression and above all a con∣veyance of the poet's ideasbeyond which every thing in vocal music is impertinenceall these are disregarded The lady who sings highest lowest longest and loudest is the best singer and thus all you principal performers stand squall∣ing and stretching out your necks like the crow in the fable forgetful of the fox underneath who not only laughs at your folly but stands ready to snap up the cheese the moment it falls out of your mouths'  'Yes' said the lady 'but we take care not to let it fall out of our mouths No no there is no fear of our getting cheese when you poets cannot get bread'  This witticism was echoed by a loud ha ha throughout the whole room after which an un∣derstrapper coming up familiarly to Charles cried  'Why I say they gives it you home brother Bruin but never mind it this is nothing at all when you are used to it'  Charles turning to the manager who also heard this said  'you are very kind and no doubt find it much to your interest to tolerate this for were not that the case this fellow would not dare to add so much impudence to his ignorance'  The manager made some trifling apology smiled a sneer and desired the repetition might begin  Many of the songs were now performed to every one of which its respective singer was suffered to make some ignorant objection At length they came to a sort of bravura song in the midst of which the leader of the band laid down his fiddle with an exclamation of  'Oh my Gad my Gad I vome play dis'  'What is the matter now'  said the manager  'Sir' cried the enraged fiddler 'it is no good no raight no arminny'  He then proceeded to a string of reasoning which as it was unintelligible to every hearer so it must be of course to every reader  He had scarce done this when Charles said  'and pray sir how long have all the laws of music ac∣knowledged you as their Lord Chancellor How long has the supremest pleasure of the soul sub∣mitted to an arbitrator sullen envious and ma∣lignantwithout taste genius or intellectsa dreaming lawgiver to sound a mad mathema∣tical musician How long have the social en∣joyments of the mind been estimated by measure and taleby niggardly scanty constrained por∣tions Go and pore over an ox's eye study op∣tics measure vacancy and thus get at the dimen∣sions of your own brain Go and  exist  but dare not think of the enjoyment of those that  live  '  And then turning to the manager  'Please sir to give orders that the repetition may go on'  This the manager thought proper to do and it was fi∣nished with no further interruption worth men∣tioning  As soon as it was over Charles said to the ma∣nager  'Sir I must beg before your people leave  the room that they may hear my declaration to you With great earnestness you invited me to this task you took ample time to deliberate on the merits of what I produced you and we had settled a convention that I am convinced would have been a mutual convenience to us It was the duty of your people according to my conception to receive their instructions and implicitly to ob∣serve them For my part had any person repre∣sented to me in reasonable language that any particular alteration was necessary either for his or her convenience or the advantage of the piece I should with willing pleasure have paid such ob∣servations every attention they could possibly me∣rit but sir evidently by your connivance I have sustained affronts from many of your people who poor wretches mean me no illwill by doing that which your frequent permission has stampt into a duty Your drift then appears to lower me to the abject contemptible humiliation of those authors and musicians who depend on you and who administering to your ignorance and caprice insult the public with nonsense and barbarism to the disgrace of letters and the total perversion of science Keep these at your beck and call and welcome but let me warn you not to expect again that you can with impunity make a tool of any man who has ground to think  worthily of himfelf and virtue enough to be in∣dependant lest an exposition of your arcana rouse the offended public to support the cause of in∣jured merit and oblige you to restore those men of talents for whose encouragement your theatre was given you in trust Others may be roused for my part I shall content myself with smiling on you with contempt'  So saying he walked out of the house no one attempting to interfere for the performers looked on one another in astonishment to see an author who refused to be a foot ball and the manager who saw it would be to no purpose to detain our hero at present was meditating how he might keep both the piece and the author at his own disposal  CHAPTER IX  ONE NEGOCIATION FINISHED AND ANOTHER BEGAN  As soon as our hero got home he sent for his piece Instead of it however he received the fol∣lowing letter  TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ  DEAR SIR  Your warmth this morning prevented you from seeing how much I wish to do you every justice I think some of the performers were right in their objections The piece wants cut∣ting and really I think it would be of use to you to admit a few Italian songs You know those capital women will give themselves airs Upon the whole as the necessary alterations will take up some timeand besides I have an afterpiece to bring out immediatelyI would wish  you to revise your opera before its next rehearsal  In the mean time you may call upon the treasurer for fifty pounds  Yours c  Without a moment's consideration Charles wrote the following answer  TO ESQ  SIR  I have declared my sentiments plainly enough already and I will not trouble myself more about this pitiful business than to say that I now demand my piece and that I am perfectly indifferent as to yourself your actors your capi∣tal women your afterpiece or your fifty pounds which last article I do not believe I am more in necessity for than you are The bearer has di∣rections not to come away without the opera  I am sir Your humble servant C HAZARD  The piece was not sent and it was with some difficulty he got it back again two months after∣wards Thus ended his connection with the the∣atre  Our hero's next effort was among the booksellers Many offers were made him to work by the sheet but these he rejected with contempt at which he was given to understand that haughty demeanour would totally destroy all his expectations for though to work for the theatre might be very humiliating to work for the trade would be still more soCould he submit to estimate his work as they sell poetry to the chandlers shops by weight Could he watch publications as they fell in and became universal property mutilate them and make an unconnected jumble out of them under the title of 'Beauties of an eminent Poet' Could he take the old magazines and newspapers and make out of them a new periodical publication Had he a knack of criticising authors that never existedWas he expert without plan or necessity at poetic ribaldry which dealt about the faeces of satire against all ranks and distinctions without either its truth its elegance or its pointand especially against that high character whose heart is the seat of goodness and mercy whose private worth is the criterion of domestic virtue and whose public ex∣cellence  is not more distinguishable by the splendour of his situation than by the gracious beneficence with which he adorns it  Could he feign epitaphs Anticipate parliament speeches Make men of abilities write nonsensical odesor invent dull good things spoken by a dead doctor Could he one day pull down the fa∣brick of the constitution and the next build it up again  If he could not do any of these he had better be hackney writer to an attorney clerk to a lottery office or any thing than an author Where was the use of any thing new Had not every thing that can be said on all possible subjects been ex∣hausted time out of mind Was there a single idea that at this time of day could be put in a new point of view How many histories of England were there How many histories of other coun∣tries How many general histories And yet could any body say which should be credited No no the mystery of writing was now at an end the whole business was compiling and it was the ex∣treme of arrogance in any person to expect payment but as a compiler In short if he would quietly put on his apron and sleeves take the scissors the wa∣sers and the paste pot come contentedly into the  garret and sell his labour for as much as it was worth he might get pretty bread enough but if not he had better take a pickaxe or a beetle and dig graves or thump the pavement  This was the sum of his reception with several to whom he applied At length however he thought he had nicked the very chance that would make his fortune He was recommended to a bookseller of the name of Alley who he was informed dealt largely and liberally To him he went and very candidly told him that as he had the reputation of a man of worth an extensive publisher and a libe∣ral dealer he should be glad to treat with him for some things he had by him  'Sir' replied Alley 'Mr Hazard I shall say in answer to this here proposial that I am a man of fortune and I spends what I gets freely ben't afraid dam'me of a few shiners and when I sees a work that's a work of merit I deals upon the nail and as a gentleman should Here harkee in the shop there Did the lady in her chariot call this morning'  'No'  'No dam'me you always say no But my lord did though or else Sir Peter In short sirI say one of my people bring me the keys of the warehouse Stop nowlook  at this drawer full chuck fullall novelsI supply every library in the kingdom Going to bring out a fire new novel edition of Thomas Hickathrift for schools Oh the keys you shall see my warehouse'  So saying he lugged our hero into another street where he introduced him to an immense number of publications in sheets  'There' said he 'did you ever see any thing like this Here is a grand edition of Mother Goose's Tales purceeded with a wooden frontispiece for the Christmas holidays all titivated up out of other things by gradivates from the two universes of Oxford and Cambridge I pays them well one has had seventeen and sixpence before hand Yes yes every body knows my generosity but then its a damned fine thing to be charitable'  Thus he ran over all the rooms in the house pointing out upon every shelf some new book of equal importance with those already mentioned till at length he convinced our hero he was conceited ignorant and purse proud and alike a stranger to taste and liberality  Charles seeing this determined to cut the matter short  'Pray' said he 'Mr Alley do you read  all these things before they come out'  'Read' said the other 'I read Dam'me you think that I can read No no I got other guess work to mind I can tell you My gradivates and my par∣sons and them there fellows read No no I can't do every thing I can only say if you'll fa∣vour me with any of your works in the novel waynovels you see are my fortethey shall be read and if they meet approbation money dam'me money is no object In short as I say in my advertisement to such ladies and gentle∣men as favour me with their manuscripts that I flatter supported by their patronage to render in future what has been esteemed frivile of stand∣ing merit entertainment and general improve∣ment'  'There's epitaphs for you'  'They are very extraordinary epithets indeed' said Charles  'Ay ay epithets' returned Alley 'you are right dam'me my head is always a wool ga∣thering Well sir shall I be favoured with your manuscript'  'Why sir' said Charles 'I will be very plain with you I have a thing something in the style of a novel which I will send you It will make two small duodecimo volumes'  'Ay twelves I understand you' returned the bookseller 'that's right I like twelves  'But I premise' added  our hero 'that if your graduates find any merit in them I expect to receive a handsome gratuity for my labours'  'That's enough' said Alley 'send them we shan't disagree'  They parted Charles sent his book and after repeated attempts to get it back again or an answer to his terms he at length received the following letter  TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ THESE PRESENT  SIR  I received yours and I am sorry my ab∣sence being out of town deprived my answer  Your book unfortunably does not meet ap∣probation as such is returned You may send for it to my house in LeadenheadLane when convenient only please to say which it is as I have so many otherwise you may not get the right  I am in great haste Your very humble servant WILLIAM ALLEY  This letter as well it might gave our hero a surfeit of booksellers Heavens how he pitied Mr Alley's parsons and graduates It was a sen∣sible satire upon an enlightened age But was there really no trace of that liberality among booksellers which formerly characterised them How freely had hundreds nay thousands been paid for books and surely books were then bought with as much avidity as formerly He would try again it was to no purpose and yet he knew not why His former publications had sold rapidly The differ∣ence was they were written for amusement he now wrote for bread  In this situation he was determined to have re∣course to his old friend Ego who to eke out his poetry enjoyed the comfortable consolation of a snug annuity  Ego was very glad to see Charles and said after shaking him heartily by the hand  'Ay ay I am the man to come to for advice Who have you ap∣plied to'  Charles told him to all the booksellers without effect  'Dam'me that's a shame' cried Ego 'if I were a bookseller I would treat au∣thors with such liberality'  'But as you are not Mr Ego' said Charles 'what would you ad∣vise me to do'  'Faith I don't know' said Ego  'every body is neglected would you think now a man of my merit would lay dormant as I doStay zounds let me thinkI am the man for ex∣pedients Have you any money left'  'Not much I assure you' said Charles  'Well well said Ego it must be raised I have it I am the man to serve my friends it will make your for∣tune better than bailiff's business Lord Mr Hazard how could you think of being a merci∣ful bailiff If I were a bailiff I would be the cruelest rascal that ever existed'  'And in that case' said Charles 'you would be more in cha∣racter than I was but what is your expedient'  'I will tell you' said Ego 'you will laugh I am the man for making people laugh I would have a new newspaper There is a plan'  'A very good one' said Charles 'if a man had a thou∣sand pounds to spare and could stand in the con∣cern without partners'  'Yes yes' said Ego 'but people must not now adays stand upon niceties Do you know any thing of editing I am the man for an editor I would have my pa∣per full of good essays I would stick to my party I would maintain tooth and nail the principles of that side I decidedly took If it was the minis∣terial side I would not like some papers I could name creep and cringe and be fulsome I would chuse that part of their measures that could  be deduced from meritorious motives for all conduct has its favourable sides In short there is nothing but may be represented upon some principle or other apparently worthy without the wretched necessity of having recourse to spatter and vilify others On the contrary if I decidedly took up the part of opposition I would expatiate on the noble passion of patriotism and let the ge∣nerous disinterested dictates of that glorious in∣ducement tell generally against ministers with∣out handing up their names to the public and call upon my countrymen to execrate them in the lump'  'Nobly distinguished' said Charles 'but in my opinion Mr Ego you are yet wide of the mark Why take a decided part at all unless indeed the part of truth What do you think of a paper that should watch the impositions of all the rest ex∣pose them to public view detect all their misre∣presentations strip them alike of adulation to ministers and factious cavilling against them expose the source from whence the corruption flows which poisons public peace'  'Zounds the very thing in the world' cried Ego 'and so not spare one's very brother hey as a body may say if he deserved to be treated severely and on the other side shower down encomiums upon the  virtue of one's bitterest enemies'  'Exactly my idea' cried Charles  'Zounds give me your hand' cried Ego 'Why don't you thank me for thinking of it Well I do think I have the rea∣diest brain En't I the man for a scheme'  'Yes' said Charles 'and I am the man for improving upon it For my part I like it so well that if you will breakfast with me tomorrow morning and consider the matter between this and then perhaps we may consolidate something that will be of mutual advantage'  CHAPTER X  CONSISTING OF TEMPORIZING  THE reader will think it a little strange that Charles who had disdained to sue to Sir Sidney should now seek out Ego who he had been in∣formed was one of those who did him ill offices with that very gentleman The fact is that in the most consistent human heart there is a sort of alloy a kind of instability which indeed if it had not our being would imply a perfectness which it is universally allowed does not fall to the lot of those bipeds called human beings  Charles then raged with love more violently than everfor I would not have my readers think that because I do not take up their whole time in expa∣tiating upon his amorous vagaries that he is only in love by fits and starts and at those times when I find it necessary to treat upon that subject by way of varying others On the contrary I desire it may be understood that let him appear how he  may he never ceases to be in love with Annette sleeping or wakingwhich indeed were it neces∣sary I could shew under his hand both in poetry and prosefor one single minute from the business of Aix la Chapelle to the end of his life nay were I to antidate the business and start from the sum∣mer before he went to France I dare say he might then boast as large a portion of that passion at least as many who have declared ay and sworn to it that they were dying with it  Oh this love What will it not do But I be∣lieve I may as well leave rhapsody to those who have no necessity to attend to narrative and instead of saying what it will do content myself with re∣cording what it did  I have mentioned our hero's detention of Mrs Marlow and his motive for it which I remember I had the good fortune to find perfectly approved by the reader for I saw him in my mind's eye smile as he read the circumstance Indeed Charles's partiality to her was such that after what has hap∣pened it is almost a wonder his enemies had not by this time made a handle of it to his disadvan∣tage for to say truth while other young men of his age and complexion were sacrificing to Bacchus and Venuslet it be observed I do not mean As∣tartescouring  the streets and getting into broil our spiritless youth pored over a book made a drawing or set a sonnet all which amusements were only interrupted by the harmless prattle of an old woman Indeed he has often declared that he never passed moments of more substantial pleasure than these with Mrs Marlow  To shew however that self can never be out of the question with us the subject of their conversation was ninetenths of the inducement Charles had now heard nothing of Annette for several months and in all that time his love had nothing to feed on but the letter inserted in the fourth chapter of this book The more distant his prospects were of an union with the idol of his soul the more violent was his passion for this again is the nature of love Nothing seems to be impossible to it in theory yet in practice it does not work miracles He knew the soul of Annette he knew her incapable of change he knew if cruel fortune ravished her hand nothing could dispose of her heart She had given it him it was his indissolubly his Then was there ever such a prodigy of fidelity and zeal as Emma No he was secure He could not more firmly rely on his own resolution than theirs No attachment was ever so sure so grounded so permanent What had he then to fear Nothing  from love but every thing from fortune Sir Sid∣ney was more likely to be implacable now he was rich than when he was poor  All this ground did he and Mrs Marlow go over every evening of their lives Upon these occasions she would represent to him that indeed he was not the kind of man to live in this world that it would not do upon all occasions to let the unqualified truth appear that now adays people did not open their hearts every time they opened their mouths and she could plainly shew that all his miscarriages had been owing to ingenuousness and honesty which as he would never find it in the dealings of other men so he might lay his account to its injuring him in all his concerns She said he loved the truth and she knew he would thank her for speaking it and she would therefore tell him that she took the liberty to disapprove his conduct in relation to Mr Too∣good He had himself it was true shamefully abused those talents which he really possessed and had made them scandalously subservient to his in∣terest but if the world chose to be so imposed on was any one equal to the Herculean task of remov∣ing its prejudices Mr Toogood was in possession of a very comfortable independency This alone in the opinion of the world would counteract all that could be said against him and this being the  case she did not wonder that his conduct worthy as it was had been looked upon by one half of the world as envy and by the other as illnature In short Mr Toogood she said had it in his power to have served him and it depended on himself whether he was to make an unworthy use of ad∣vantages so procured  Upon the same ground if he had paid a visit to Musquito and given a little into his humour he would doubtless have interested himself with the academicians and as he was now a man of very great consequence there could not be a doubt but it would have turned out a matter of profit to him  As to the business of the theatre it was certainly too humiliating and therefore he could not in that instance be too much commended But in short if he chose to get his bread by his talents it must be in the way others did it there was no al∣ternative and she had no doubt if he would seri∣ously lay himself out for eligible employ but he might yet acquire a fortune sufficient to satisfy Sir Sidney who she was sure would consider every guinea that was earned as twenty  Convinced by these sort of arguments our hero  as we have seen lost no opportunity of trying his ut∣most to get forward and having taken a great deal of trouble with the booksellers to no purpose he and Mrs Marlow were one evening turning all matters seriously in their minds when she said  'My dear sir it is wonderful to me you have never thought of getting about some real friend of Sir Sidney and making him your confidant If it did nothing else you would know from a channel of that sort what were his private sentiments of you and among other matters it would furnish you with some particulars relative to Miss Roe∣buck'  This last consideration bore down every other and Mr Balance was thought by both the properest man in the world for this purpose He was how∣ever at that time out of town  'But' said Charles 'a thought has struck me and it will convince you that I mean in future not to quarrel with people quite so much for their vices What do you think of Ego I have told you all his particularities and really he has not very much prostituted his talents perhaps indeed because he has but few to prostitute for the pension he has was given him more from ostentation in the donor than through any servility in himself Indeed he has too good an opinion of himself to be very solici∣tous  for he takes as much care as he can that in all his affairs Ego should be the first person'  'This is charming' said Mrs Marlow and I will warrant something comes of it for as he loves tittle tattle he knows of course all Sir Sid∣ney's family affairs and it shall go hard but I will worm some of them out of him and so you see without asking a single question I shall get at every intelligence you wish to receive  It was then agreed that Ego should be sounded but it was to appear that our hero knew nothing of the business Thus was the first duplicity he ever practised occasioned by love Indeed he could not live any longer in this state of uncertainty and if this method had not been hit upon for the present relief of his anxiety he certainly would have been put upon playing some mad prank or other which might have induced concessions on his side for which he never would have forgiven himself  On the other hand this business was a lucky hit for Mrs Marlow who just at that time was upon the point of forging some sort of intelligence to soften the edge of our hero's unhappiness It was now however unnecessary for as Charles was not to be supposed to know what passed between her  and Ego so there would be no occasion to relate more of their conversation than such parts of it as would relieve his fears which again if they were not strong enough might admit of a little heighten∣ing whereas she resolved to sink whatever would be likely to augment his chagrin for she was not one of those friends who unnecessarily aggravated matters but on the contrary admitted that a little laudable deceit was pardonable when the proposed end was meritorious  Many good purposes Mrs Marlow flattered herself would derive from this commerce Ego she had no doubt would retail what passed in the presence of Emma whose wit and ingenuity would not fail to take hold of such an occasion to supply Charles with every thing he wished to know even probably without the conscious concurrence of Ego for it might be conveyed in such ambiguous terms as none but the lovers themselves could un∣riddle and come what come might she resolved to invent consolation where it really did not present itself for she could not bear the idea that our hero should be so afflicted  This was the first time his obstinacy towards opening a negociation with Sir Sidney seemed to give way She hoped in time he would be wholly  subdued and had no doubt when her wellinten∣tioned scheme came to have the assistance of Mr Balance that a perfect reconciliation would take place between them and then as it was in the power of Sir Sidney alone to place our hero in a very conspicuous professional lightwhich this foolish woman thought even more eligible than the possession of an inherited fortuneshe contemplated even with tears of joy that moment when she should see him happy equal to his deserts  Big with this project and these hopes Mrs Mar∣low waited with impatience for the morning and that she might employ her time to as much advan∣tage as possible entreated Charles to leave her for half an hour with Ego before he came down to breakfast  Mr Ego came very punctually to his time He was shewn in by Mrs Marlow who told him she was very sorry but Mr Hazard was a little indis∣posed and therefore she had not disturbed him but however he should be immediately calledTo which Mr Ego made answer  'Ah up late last night I suppose this is the consequence ah these young men If I was a young man I would be the mirror of sobriety'  'Then' said Mrs Marlow 'you would be ex∣actly like Mr Hazard for I never saw him other∣wise than sober in my life'  'Indeed' said Ego 'I am glad on't it is very commendable Always sober Quite an altered man I suppose since he came from France It is a lamentable thing that young men cannot make the tour of Europe without getting into so many scrapes If I was to make the tour'  'Sir' said Mrs Marlow 'he only made the tour of France which I do not believe either you or any body else could have done to better pur∣pose'  'There my good lady you must excuse me' cried Ego 'the whole world rings of his shocking doings there Why don't you know he robbed a banker knocked down his brother stole a nun spent her fortune turned sharper killed a man and then made his escape out of prison'  'No indeed I do not nor does any body else' said Mrs Marlow  'Nay but zounds madam' returned Ego 'you must excuse me there I am the man for knowing the truth of things'  'You are not the man for knowing the truth of this'  said Mrs Marlow 'for every word of it is false and I dare say by false reports like these which Mr Hazard has too much pride to contradict Sir Sidney's ear has been abused and he has lost that good gentleman's confidence'  'Faith' said Ego 'like enough 'for there is nothing like absence for injuring people in the opinion of their friends Yes yes I see how the thing has been I am the man for seeing how the cat wags her tail And so it was all lies ha'  'Did not you see it at the time Mr Ego' said the good lady 'since your penetration is so keen'  'See it' said Ego 'Oh yes Ithat is to say I had a glimpse but that damned unmerciful teazer Musquito and that cursed lamenter of his friend's misfortunes Toogood would insist upon it in such terms that you know I was obliged to run a little with the pack else you know what chance had I for a continuance of Sir Sidney's patronage Must mind the main chance you know my good lady I am the man for keeping a friend'  'That' cried Mrs Marlow 'one may easily see'  'But stop a little' cried Ego 'Can you acquit him of this Did he write one single word  to any individual soul  'And pray' answered Mrs Marlow 'was there no friend had charity enough to allow the possibility at least that his letters had been intercepted and if that were the case was it not also possible that he who did him that injury would not stop at others'  'Gloss Gloss' cried Ego 'zounds I see it I am the man for putting the saddle on the right horse And yet do you know he had the address always to appear Mr Hazard's friend But he has such a way with him sure steady never brought up the subject but when he had made Sir Sidney charmed with himself on account of some act of generosity performed by the baronet himself or his great grandfather Yes yes it is plain He is a devil of a fellow to be sureWhy he bewitches people Not that his praise of my poetry was any such great matter common fame does me justice I am the man for poetry but the devil of it is who is this fellow that makes such a plaguy noise in the world'  'Who' said Mrs Marlow 'a great man a member of parliament'  'A mighty great affair indeed' cried Ego 'In your ear if he was out of parlia∣ment he would be in the King's Bench'  'In∣deed' cried Mrs Marlow pretending great astonishment  'Owes seventy thousand pounds'  continued Ego 'you may depend upon it from me I am the man for knowing how the world wags'  'Well but if this be the case' cried Mrs Marlow 'how is it possible that Sir Sidney can be so blinded as to intend his marriage with Miss Roebuck'  'I will tell you how that matter stands' said Ego 'If the ministry goes out and they say it totters at presentfor you see I am the man for being a bit of a politicianif do you mind me they go out Mr Gloss will be a made man and then he will certainly marry Miss Roebuck'  'With the young lady's consent no doubt' said Mrs Marlow  'Not a word of that' said Ego 'she will obey if you please but never consent I am the man for distinctions'  'What has she any new lover then' said Mrs Marlow 'for surely she cannot have kept herself heartwhole for Mr Hazard in the midst of such ceaseless persecutions and against so many reports to his disadvantage'  'My good lady' said Ego 'such truth such in∣nocence such sweetness such sense of duty as Miss Roebuck possesses I have often read of and indeed described just as one describes in poetry sylphs  gnomes or flying dragons children of fancy offsprings of the imaginationI am the man for a choice of wordsin short a thing without literal existence but I confess I never saw it beforeWhy I have seen her receive a command from Sir Sidney with a smile while her heart was bursting In short she will become a voluntary sacrifice to her duty as soon as the ministry changes'  'This then is the arrangement' cried Mrs Marlow 'and the poor lady and the nation are to turn about together'  'Even so' said Ego 'I wish we could say with truth that in either case turn about would be fair play I am the man for a pun'  'But pray' said Mrs Marlow 'what part does Mrs Emma take'  'Why that that' said Ego 'is what I am just now astonished at Until very lately she had been a most strenuous advocate for Mr Hazard but I think now we may call her the armed neutrality But upon my word my good lady the young gentleman may thank him∣self if his friends grow cool to him Can any thing be so mad as the way he has spent his mo∣ney  What the devil had he to do with bailiffs and charity and beef and bread Nobody does it So you see his conduct is a satire upon the world and now I only ask you does any body like to be satirized I am the man that under∣stands propriety And then you see to brag of his actions and try to depreciate the benevolence of Sir Sidney in his favourite scheme of Castle∣wick'  'Ay has he done that' said Mrs Marlow  'It has lost him the baronet for ever that's all' replied Ego 'Now I would not have done that I am the man that never flies in any body's face'  'But I assure you Mr Ego' said Mrs Marlow 'he had not done this'  'What' said Ego 'did not he boast of having served more people in real distress in six months than ever Sir Sidney did in all his life'  'Never' said Mrs Marlow 'I will answer for him'  'And did not he try to prove by several instances that there was no sort of comparison in his charity and that of the ba∣ronetfor dam'me said he one day when he was drunk'  'But I tell you he never gets drunk' said Mrs Marlow  'Well' said Ego 'sober then so much the worse if he had been drunk he would have been excuseable Dam'me says he'  Here Charles interrupted them  'Ha my good friend Hr Hazard I am glad you are come I want my breakfast devilishly I am the man for the hot rolls and butter Here have this good lady and I been battling about you Upon my soul she is a strong advocate a staunch friend never saw such an instance of attachment and fide∣lity But come 'ent we to see Miss'  'Miss' said Charles 'what Miss'  'Why Lord now how strange you make of it' said Ego 'I mean the old gentlewoman's daughter they tell me she is temptingly handsome I am the man that is a judge of beauty'  'I wish' said Charles 'you were a judge of good manners I gave you a hint yesterday that if we were to be friends you must not attempt to glance at my actions in any way for as I shall not think it worth my while to ex∣plain my motives for what I really do so I give you warning you will not find me in a humour to pass calumny by quietly'  Here Mrs Marlow brought in the breakfast and the conversation became general  CHAPTER XI  IN WHICH MATTERS SEEM TO DRAW NEARER TO A CRISIS  CHARLES having taken an opportunity during breakfast of going out of the room Mrs Marlow begged Ego not to hint a single syllable of the con∣versation that had passed between them She said Mr Hazard was so tenacious of those resolutions he had taken of abiding by the truth of his inten∣tions without stooping to an explanation with any body that she was sure he would break off for ever with any friend who should be unwise enough to stagger his determination  'and as I am sure Mr Ego' added she 'he has a regard for you it would be pity you should lose one another's friend∣ship in the moment of coming together'  She hinted also that she should be glad to have some more private conversation with him and cunningly pretended to wonder what could have caused this alteration in Emma To which he answered he would learn the next day if possible for he was  to dine at Sir Sidney's and added  'Oh bless my heartI am the man for recollectionMr Fig∣gins is in town pray has he called on Mr Ha∣zard'  'I fancy not' said Mrs Marlow 'but why'  'Nay nothing' replied Ego 'only they say he has been like the rest of the worldgot it while it was going hey you understand me fools and their moneyheyI am the man for a pro∣verb'  And then seeing Charles  'but mum's the word don't be afraid of me'  After breakfast our hero and his friend Ego re∣sumed the conversation of the day before which they had both duly considered Mr Ego said that as far as his advice or interest went he was heart and hand at Charles's service but as it was both unnecessary to his circumstances and improper at his time of life he begged to be excused from hav∣ing any immediate concern in it  'for I am the man' said he 'that knows how to take care of myself'  Charles who was determined if he did any thing it should be solely his own concern did not dislike this declaration and after some further consul∣tation it was agreed that about eight hundred pounds was enough to start the paper two hun∣dred of which our hero could muster and it was  proposed to raise the rest by shares of fifty pounds each In short Ego in company with Charles beat up the quarters of all those who from disap∣pointment an adventurous spirit or other motives were likely to come into it and after several meetings many regulations and other  pro  and  con  it was at length agreed that Charles should be the sole conductor of the paper have four shares for his two hundred pounds and a salary of two hun∣dred a year but as its failure if it did not suc∣ceed must naturally be attributed to his want of abilities to conduct it he should be obliged on its being proved to be a losing game every day for a fortnight together to take all their shares back at the original price and on the other hand if it succeeded beyond expectation he should be made a proportionable amends  These terms were extremely well relished and our hero took the field as generalissimo of diurnal criticism He detected the fallacy of other papers reprobated their venality resuted their arguments and shewed the futility of all their proceedings and though the concern sustained a loss almost every day the world's eyes began to be opened and probably the matter would have been hand∣somely taken up if internal divisions had not con∣vulsed the whole plan The fact was this four of  the other papers had each sent a purchaser of a share whose instructions were to kindle as much strife as possible among the partners Thus upon separate grounds they began to split this little community into factions One said a newspaper was not worth a farthing that did not take a decided part another that they ought to have secured advertisements be∣fore they had started a third was beginning when our hero begged leave to remark that no partner had a right to interfere with the conduct of the paper Let him then take up the shares according to his agreement was the answer His was imme∣diately at his service Charles now too late saw the drift of this He said if he had known he had em∣barked with a set of men who were afraid of a little risk he would have set his face to the business alone at first but he was willing nevertheless to abide by all his agreement He had certainly ran himself out of ready cash but if any gentlema would take his note at a short date for the amount of his share it was heartily at his service Three took him at his word at that meeting and by a week afterwards he was left with but four part∣ners  Had the paper been dealt by honestly it would have done wonders but the proprietors of the rest who had not the courage to defend their measures  openlyfor indeed they were indefensibletam∣pered with the newscarriers and were guilty of a thousand other paltry shifts and tricks to prevent its circulation They also brided the printer to insert such words as rendered the writing nonsense after the correction of the last proof and when it was impossible to prevent its going in that state into the world  There was a dirtiness in these proceedings which Charles could not stoop to a detection of He doubled his satire and they their arts till at length every partner had begged to be off and he was left alone to stem the torrent He now found himself playing at a losing game almost exhausted of all his cash and engaged for the payment of six hun∣dred pounds so that driven into every possible corner he was compelled to send this scheme after the rest and sell the materials for a supply  Now it was that Charles discovered who had been his partners in the paper for their end being answered they published his disgrace in the most triumphant language their virulent and low male∣volence could suggest They recapitulated all his former miscarriages gave an invidious turn to his whole conduct misrepresented him in regard to his opera and warned the public how it encouraged a  man who instead of being avowedly its servant had the arrogant presumption to set up a standard of taste and the vanity to suppose that all the world must bow to his  ipse dixit  Charles avoided with every possible industry all chance of getting into a personal quarrel upon this occasion knowing that he could reap no honour from a contention with men of no character and that they would in their report of him so per∣vert his motives of resentment as to throw a public stigma on him let his conduct be ever so rightIndeed his notions upon this subject were a little heteroclite for he maintained that duelling was not only a very barbarous but a very dishonourable custom and that it served more to assist the views of cowards and assassins than to support the dig∣nity of such as possessed true courage  In defence of this opinion he certainly advanced a great deal of persuasive reasoning which unfortu∣nately nobody listened to for people however they break through established customswhether by stealing your purse or your peace of mind or cutting your throatnever appear publicly to dis∣approve of them  This very opinion was taken advantage of by  Gloss who negociated a quarrel so well that our hero received a challenge from a rascal and refused to meet him His pusillanimity was immediately the public topic and though he was a short time after under the unpleasant necessity of kicking the fellow out of a coffeehouse who had had the im∣pudence to traduce him yet in the next company he went he scarcely was spoken to  Charles securely wrapt up in his own conscious honour certainly held all this in ineffable con∣tempt yet fearing lest accumulated provocation should induce him to depart from that forbearance which his rectitude had pointed out in his case to be necessary he wisely resolved to read none of the abuse written against him lest he should be pro∣voked into a reply that would make his competi∣tors of more consequence than he wished He re∣lied on the candour of the public for a tacit refuta∣tion of all calumny whatsoever and instead of in∣volving himself in more troubles began seriously to consider how he could get rid of those with which he was already surrounded  He had about seventy pounds and the furniture of his house which was decent and convenient but no more The earliest of his notes was within five days of being due and a fortnight more would bring  the rest upon his back in consequence of which all the horrors of a prison and the merciless severity of bailiffs who owed him so much ill will would be inevitable  To avoid these unpleasant circumstances he re∣solved to go to France which determination how∣ever he imparted to nobody but his faithful house∣keeper whose success had been upon a par with his for Ego had brought her intelligence that there was no knowing what to make of Emma that the ministry was changed and Mr Gloss now filled a high and conspicuous situation and in short that every thing in that quarter menaced our hero's affairs with ruin and total destruction  Though Mrs Marlow when she had fancied things wore a brighter complexion had deter∣mined to put the best face on the matter to Charles finding them in this desperate way she saw there was no time for trifling Besides Mr Gloss's situation was a public town talk and all the rest would be known of course Indeed the good crea∣ture could not dissemble her very heart spoke in her eyes and he saw his wretchedness before she uttered a syllable  Another circumstance greatly perplexed Charles  and made him wish to seclude himself from all the world Mr Figgins had certainly been in town but had not called upon him Indeed a mystery had hung over that gentleman's conduct for some time When Charles conferred on him the annuity he received a letter thanking him in terms of such enthusiastic warmth that he thought it a little over∣strained and some suspicious matters had since in∣duced him to believe that his old friend finding he had got all he could now turned his back upon him which the reader no more than Charles will think an extraordinary conjecture But what were now his sensations when he found beyond all doubt that this very friend who had sworn so hear∣tily never to desert his interest who knew all the secrets of his soul who in short had more power than any man in the world to shew his enemies how to take advantage of him had gone over to Mr Gloss  Charles had all his life wanted a friend he had been very often plunged in misfortune but this was the first time that he saw himself on the brink of actual poverty without a single resource The brute Musquito was master of an ample fortune the pliant Toogood had a profitable place and even that echo of his own praise Ego had sat himself  down comfortably These men had nothing for which they ought to be rewarded but much that merited reprehension while he whose whole study had been to benefit the public who had in spight of all the malignity that had overwhelmed him the testimony of hundreds to the purity of his in∣tentions which had been evinced by a strong worldly proofno less than throwing down some thousands in the prosecution of his laudable planhe in an early period of life must now learn the bitter task of bearing distress and yielding to actual want  Charles however happened to have a mind not easily to be broken  'Come Mrs Marlow' said he as they talked over his affairs 'let us set our faces to the weather They think that under such accumulated misfortunes I shall sink and they will get rid of me and indeed were I not of a different temper from any other man it would be so but I am not of a mind to indulge my ene∣mies we must not lie down in this world for want of resources and I thank God my ima∣gination flatters me I shall not be to seek for them even though experience should as usual destroy all my hopes upon proof At present certainly this kingdom is no place for me and it has struck me that by quitting it I can not only  turn my pursuits to advantage but in that very way that had I not been a fool I should all along have preferred to the straight forward reproba∣tion of duplicity by which the world's good opinion is not to be gained In short I will tell you what I will do I will get into Flanders seat myself in an obscure lodging and copy every thing I can lay my hands upon HOLBEIN or HEMSKIRK TENIERS or HOBIMA WYNANTS or VANDERVELDT nothing shall come amiss to me and when I have stocked myself with a suf∣ficient collection properly smoaked varnished and mutilated they shall be put up to auction in the English metropolis as the collection of a gen∣tleman who died upon his travels'  Mrs Marlow declared she had now some hopes of him and begged he would set about it imme∣diately  'I will' said Charles with a profound sigh 'and yet it is very hard to be cut off from every hope I could have borne any thing every thing sustained torture and called it pleasure could I still have flattered myself with the hopes of ob∣taining Annette Oh let no man place his hap∣piness on the promises of a woman I could have endured misery beggary for her Want and all  its grim train should have been my welcome companions I would have blessed the moment that made me wretched to prove my love But come no weakness let me feel but not mur∣mur let me since there is nothing else with which I can reproach myself so forget the dig∣nity of my love as to reproach her No however she may excel me in happiness and fortune she never shall be my superior in truth and honour'  CHAPTER XII  CONTAINS AMONG OTHER THINGS A VERY UNEXPECTED VISIT  EVERY invention having been exhausted to ward off the coming blow without success Charles be∣gan in earnest to think of retiring to the continent to which he was not a little stimulated by his new scheme He was so closely pressed that he was obliged to decamp in the middle of the night for he had heard that very morning that a writ had been obtained against him from one of his most invete∣rate enemiesthough the note o which account it was issued was not dueupon a pretence that it was his intention to leave the kingdom  It was eleven o'clock in the night that this scheme was to be put in execution Our hero had just supped and spoken these parting words to Mrs Marlow  'Since I have lost every friend upon earth but you since in this country men of ho∣nest principles cannot flourish since my love and honour have been equally betrayed and every  worthy effort to gain the world's esteem and se∣cure a faithful return to my hopeless affection has been attended with nothing but ingratitude shame and disappointment I go to find a little recollec∣tion and to shake off this strange dream of fruit∣less expectation in another country and since I have found to my mortification that here the whole world lives in a happy delirium and en∣joys no pleasure but through the medium of be∣ing cheated by their own consent I will one day or other return and administer to their amusement in the only way any man can hope for success the honesty of which I now fairly subscribe to for how can it be said that people are imposed upon when they consent to the deception Hav∣ing made by means like these a competency you and I my dear Marlow will retire to some snug retreat where as at a comedy we will look at the world and laugh but never venture again to have any thing to do with it otherwise than as spectators for fear of the humiliation that as ac∣tors we should be sure to meet with  'These are strange declarations in so young a man but they are perfectly reasonable perfectly honest and I can set the point I aim at within my view as easily as Mr Gloss though perhaps I may not attain it by means so rascally And now  my good my kind friend adieu There is an in∣strument by which the furniture of this house is become yours It is a poor present but per∣haps it may assist you through the medium of letting lodgings to eke out the little I may be able to send you At present I can very well spare you forty pounds and that you may not have a word to say in reply I promise you if I should be in necessity I will as freely have re∣course to you'  Charles then ran over all his former schemes and shewed in what instances he would make them serve as a warning as to his future intentions which he had strenuously at heart and through which he doubted not he should one day be able to shew how greatly he could be independant with barely a com∣petency He spoke of the treachery of Figgins but still attributed that as well as every other mis∣fortune to his own stupid credulity alone for that he ought to have known what a world he lived in and not have suffered himself to be imposed upon  'And yet' said he 'my dear Mrs Marlow there is a circumstance that I must complain of though it is taxing perfection arraigning heaven itself But this is not the time to awaken any feeling to stagger my resolution Still I would wish you to see that false that lovely creature to see  Emma too Do not however upbraid either of them Let them only know that they imposed upon a heart that deserved better of them that it shall break misery shall dissolve it torture tear it before it shall consent to a single murmur though but a whisper Tell my Annette to be happy to be supremely blest without an in∣truding care and to think that I am too fortu∣nate if I have secured her happiness at so trifling an expence as the loss of my peace Tell herbut indeed it is dreadful I cannot at present bear the conflict and I mustheavenly powersbut come let me be a man and keep my senses'  At these words he reclined against the wainscot with one hand on his forehead the other on his heart and his eyes turned upwards as if imploring those powers which if we may judge of what im∣mediately followed were as deaf to his calls as the hearts of his pretended friends had been to the calls of honour  As he stood in this attitude and as Mrs Marlow contemplated him with ineffable complacency and tender sorrow a loud knocking was heard at the door What could it be At that time of night too Certainly Charles's enemies had been apprized of his intentions and were determined to prevent  his escape  'Lord' cried Mrs Marlow 'what shall we do'  'Do' said Charles 'why if they will have me I must submit to it'  'Not for the world' said Mrs Marlow 'For God's sake my dear sir go up stairs pretty high if you please and if you find it is any thing of that sort fairly go out of the garret window and creep on three doors farther to Mr Lott'sYou can easily get along the gutter and after the coast is clear I will go to Mr Lott's apprize them of the truth and you shall stay there till a proper time'  Charles made some objections to Mrs Marlow's expedient but a second thundering at the door overruled them And now Mrs Marlow went boldly to demand who it was that paid them this unseasonable visit  Before she would open the door she called to know who was there She was answered by a postillionfor she could see his dress and his whip through the key hole by the light of the lampthat there were some of Mr Hazard's friends out of the country in a chaise who must see him even at that time of night  Mrs Marlow overjoyed with the hopes that her  friend's affairs might have taken some favourable turn and at any rate guarded as we have seen against sinister consequences made no scruple of opening the door which she had no sooner done than two men handed a lady out of a chaise and all together came within the door one of the gen∣tlemen desiring the lady might be shewn into a room This Mrs Marlow who was greatly struck with the lady's uncommon beauty scrupled not to do after which one of the gentlemen tak∣ing her aside begged Mr Hazard would come to them immediately for that the lady was Miss Roe∣buck  At these words Mrs Marlow flew up stairs and in less than a minute introduced our hero first hav∣ing informed him that she would bring him to a friend whose presence would make him ample amends for all his former troubles but who that friend could be in spight of all his entreaties she left him to guess  If our hero's faculties were upon the stretch to find who this extraordinary friend could be who contrary to the hard customs of the times had ge∣nerously sought the dwelling of the unfortunate what was his excessive astonishment when a gleam that had started across his suspended thoughts just  as he arrived at the door was presently realized by the sight of her who held his captive soul who now sat in the very chair out of which ten minutes before he had himself risen  He started much more naturally than I have seen a hero on the stage at the sight of a ghost and ex∣claimed  'Heavens and earth Am I awake Is it possible that the divine Annette'  'No sir' exclaimed the lady with great anger 'it is not possible that she can come any where by her own consent into your presence unless to tell you how much she disdains your low arts'  'For God's sake madam' cried Charles in an agony 'what do you mean Am I to be every way tortured Is my whole life to be a dream Am I to comprehend nothing'  'Admirably acted' said the lady 'I wanted but this to be convinced'  'Convinced of what ma∣dam' cried Charles' 'that my existence my very soul is in your power and therefore you can tor∣ture it at will'  'For shame' cried Annette 'I only want to ask you one question Do you think by this  violent conduct to accomplish your wishes Do you not think by it that you have and with rea∣son lost my father for ever'  'I know I have lost him madam' cried Charles 'I was told too I had lost you and now lest I should doubt the truth of my being completely miserable you are condescending enough to put me entirely out of pain by confirming it with your own mouth in this extraordinary manner too at this unseasonable hour'  'Wretch' cried Annette 'can you pretend to charge me with what you have caused yourself Is not the whole your own doing Has not your unhappy impetuosity undone you And now instead of defending yourself you are determined I shall be no more out of doubt than the rest In short I am convinced that it is impossible to be on terms with you and I declare to you in so many wordsthough I will not so falsify my character as to say it does not pain me to make the effortI will never be yours'  As this moment as if in a violent flurry in rushed Mr Gloss  'And here' cried Charles 'is the happy man who is to witness my disgrace and triumph over me but by all that is sacred  he shall not live to enjoy this happiness for this hand'  Saying this he ran to his pistols which he had loaded to take with him at which both Annette and Mrs Marlow screamed Mr Gloss told them not to be afraid adding with a sneer that no harm would happen which probably he knew for another person who then entered the room caught hold of Charles's arm and proclaimed aloud that he had an action against him  'Then all is over' said Charles  and dropt into a chair Annette at this moment was not in a better condition Lest however she should discover her confusion to Charles she begged Mr Gloss would conduct her home declaring she felt herself greatly indisposed  'I don't doubt it madam' said Mr Gloss'the gentleman however shall smart for it You triumphed sir' said he 'when last this lady was in danger now I think it is my turn'  'Thine' cried Charles starting from his re∣verie 'Worm Reptile Thy turn to triumph over me But I thank you madam' said he to Annette 'It is plain you wanted an excuse in the  opinion of the world for the most inexcuseable trait of falshood and levity that ever disgraced your sex and I may say now that  you  have well acted your part and so madam adieu There is yet time before you sleep to glut the ear of your father with the information that my downfal is completed And now sir' said he to the man who had arrested him 'I am ready for you'  Saying these words he snatched up his hat and left first the room and then the house in company with the bailiff and his follower  The moment Charles had walked off as we have described Annette cried out  'Oh Mr Gloss I am very ill'  and fell lifeless on the floor Mrs Marlow was not idle she produced some drops which revived her in the course of a few minutes but it must be confessed that good old lady's atten∣tion was of a very chequered kind for though hu∣manity had obliged her to pay Annette every possi∣ble respect in her then situation yet her heart bled for the sufferings of poor Charles to which she could not help thinking that Mr Gloss at least had contributed by this last unmanly business of the arrest which she was induced to believe he had connived at through cowardice lest had our hero fair play he must have answered to him this trea∣chery and that very severely  Under this idea when Annette came to herself Mrs Marlow did not spare to exclaim against the scandalous conduct of those who had she said by spreading the most infamous and injurious calumny wounded the character of a young gentleman who had no equal in the world  'I believe so' said Gloss with an invidious leer 'for egregious folly intolerable pride and un∣bounded profligacy But come madam' said he to Annette 'I believe there is a coach at the door and we want no advice from this good lady who of course is partial to him whose bread she eats'  'I do eat his bread' cried Mrs Marlow 'and heaven is my witness I would not eat it if I did not know him to be what I say I know he is the worthiest best gentlest noblest creature that ever did honour to human nature I know his soul is above every thing that is ungenerous or unjust I know in short he is the very reverse of you from whom I have not been able to take off my eyes ever since you came into the room and I will tell you why I look on you with horror and believe you capable of every thing horrid and infamous for you are the very picture of a man whom I knew to be the most villainous and despicable upon earth'  'I am much obliged to you madam' said Mr Gloss 'for your eulogium and now I believe we have no further business here'  So saying he gave his hand to Annette who had been drowned in tears for some minutes and who now retired with her protector as he called himself without the power of paying her acknowledgments to Mrs Mar∣low so warmly as the case required or her wishes prompted her  THE YOUNGER BROTHER  BOOK VI  IN WHICH THE GREAT VARIETY OF FOREGOING PER∣PLEXITIES ARE REGULARLY WROUGHT UP AND COM∣PLETELY UNRAVELLED  CHAPTER I  IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND MUCH MORE THAN HE EXPECTED  A MOST miserable night did poor Mrs Marlow pass in our hero's absence She did not know where he was gone or by what means to get any tidings of him In this exigence she would have waited on Mr Balance a step which she repented she had not taken beforebut as all her cogitations terminated in a resolution to adopt no active mea∣sure of her own head lest she should injure him she  wished to serve she even sat herself down quietly and waited with the most tantalizing impatience  ill by hearing from him she should be released  om her anxiety  Under these circumstances had she remained like a timid hare in her form dreading she knew not what till about two o'clock the next day when she heard as violent a thundering at the door as she had heard the night before She immediately flew to the door and let in not our hero but a gentleman who said Mr Hazard must be found if he was above ground for that his brother lay at the point of death and that he was come post haste from the country to consult him on some family matters which were of the last importance  Mrs Marlow begged his pardon but could not conceive in what way Lord Hazard's death could possibly affect his brother that nobleman she fancied had nothing but the title and estate to give and those would of course go to his infant son who she supposed was not lying at the point of death As to any legacies she did not believe his lordship had lived so frugal as to have any to leave and were not this the case she could not be inclined to think his good will towards his brother extended  so far as to have induced him to do any thing in his favour  The stranger said she was perfectly right but yet his business with him was of a particular natureIn short neither could make any thing of the other what the strangers sentiments were we shall see  As to Mrs Marlow she thought this chicken was of the same brood with the rest and that he only wanted to get out of her what he could per∣haps to lay a detainer against Charles or for some other purpose equally inimical  At the end of four daysfor till then had this poor friendly creature been tormented with alter∣nate hopes and fearsshe received a letter by the post on which she was astonished to see the post∣mark Ostend but her astonishment was still high∣tened by noticing the hand writing of her friend and benefactor This was the letter  To Mrs MARLOW AT  MY DEAR MRS MARLOW  As I know you must be under the most torturing state of anxiety upon my account I  take the very earliest opportunity of relieving you from it by informing you by what means I am able to date a letter from this place  Sensibly as I felt at leaving that false deluded creature in the hands of her betrayer and mine I had no sooner got into the street than I began to think my pecuniary affairs at that moment de∣manded my first attention I therefore prevailed upon the bailiff to accompany me to a tavern rather than to any house of security that if pos∣sible I might hit upon some terms of accommo∣dation This after a short hesitation he con∣sented to There while I plied him with wine a thought struck me that this should be my first attempt at imposition which I the less hesitated at as the fellow was a notorious rascal This stroke as it has been attended with success I have no doubt but I shall hereafter follow it up with others till our competency will be secure and then I promise you not all the Annettes upon earth shall draw from me a single sigh  I begged his patient attention to what I was go∣ing to say I then told him that when I was last in France I fell in love with a young lady of con∣siderable merit and fortune who would without reluctance give me her hand as soon as I should  arrive on the continent that the amour in ques∣tion had created a jealousy in the young lady he had seen and that I was very sure the business of the writ had been connived at with a view of keep∣ing me from quitting the kingdom that I would to come to the point make him all the amends in my power if he would in any way suffer me to escape  To my great surprisefor I did not think this would half do with himhe appeared willing to treat and in short after many scruplessuch as that he should certainly have the whole debt and costs to pay and others equally cogenthe agreed late as it was to knock up two of his friends to be bail for me who to make short of the story appeared and I gave a bond among them to pay a hundred pounds when I should return to En∣gland provided that event took place in three months a hundred and fifty if it exceeded six and double that sum if I returned a married man  As I know these fellows to be as voracious as pikes you may easily guess I lost not a moment in making the best use of my time Thus of course I did not come home nor would I trust myself to write to you till I touched this ground  lest my next letter should be worse to you than the suspence I know you have kindly felt by giving you an account of a second loss of liberty  I shall wait in this place a week I beg there∣fore you will write the moment you receive this and I charge you as you value truth and my friendship qualify nothing let me have the sim∣ple undisguised matter of fact particularly as to Annette If she consent to marry that rascal Gloss though my first feelings will be a wish to come to England purposely to cut her husband's ears off my second which will very soon suc∣ceed the other will settle all other considerations into contempt and then I shall be in such a frame of mind as to make me obliterate a set of people from my memory in whom I have been mistaken Surely this will be moderate enough  As soon as I get your letter and have delibe∣rated a little on my present affairs I shall endea∣vour to get among the Flemings Pray do not let a single soul at present know where I am This country is not so safe as France You will find enclosed the forty pounds which our extraordi∣nary visitants prevented me from giving you I have no present occasion for it and you can lay part of it out to advantage in decorating my old  apartments for the accommodation of lodgers If in that or any way they can be turned to your advantage it will give me more pleasure than it possibly could to occupy them myself but re∣member I charge you not to attempt returning this money or any thing similar to it for I de∣clare most solemnly if you do I will not let you know my route in which case your intention will be defeated for beside the hazard I can in that case return what you send whereas you will be deprived of a similar advantage At the same time to make you perfectly easy I will permit you to do what you can for me if I should be in actual necessity  You see my dear Mrs Marlow I must still be proud but ought not a man to be so who is determined to impose upon all the world He ought to be a clever fellow and therefore should be proud In truth one should not laugh at this for I cannot conceive a more melancholy reflec∣tion than that the intellects of mankind are so very slender so filmy such a perfect cobweb that nothing in nature is so easy as to dupe these lords of the creation through their own conni∣vance  Adieu write immediately directed to the  post office but do not upon any account ven∣ture a second letter till I have answered the first Another thing remember put all letters into the post yourself My whole downfal among the Roebucks is imputable you know to intercepted letters though they poor dupesis it not true that people are easily dupeddo not even yet believe it  Your affectionate friend CHARLES HAZARD  As I mean now to watch our hero's progress for some time which by the bye is but fairas he is deserted by every other friendI shall say at pre∣sent that nothing of any consequence happened to him at Ostend but the receipt of the following letter from Mrs Marlow in answer to the pre∣ceding one  TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ  WORTHY SIR  Before I received your letter I had ga∣thered a great deal of news for you God be praised that you are in a place of safety Here I  believe the people are all mad The madest of them is her you and I a month ago would have sworn was not to be changed In short what signifies hiding it Miss Roebuck that was is now Mrs Gloss I have seen her myself and spoken to her but indeed I am so flurried I don't know where to begin first They have made me mad among them but I have left off writing to cry a little and now I shall have patience to tell you every thing in form  You must know the day after you left the house a gentleman came in a violent hurry with a strange story that your brother lay at the point of death but I took him for some enemy and so sent him away with a flea in his ear I have been vexed at it ever since for the news about his pre∣cious lordship is true nay it is now reported he is dead But what is this to you You know sir there are two infant Lord Hazards in being When he comes next however I shan't snap him up so short  You are to understand that your brother's ill∣ness was occasioned by an accident when he was hunting His horse plunged into a river and he for some time was so entangled in the stir∣rups  that he had like to have been drownedbut you saved him from the other fate in France and his good stars from this in England As he was however sometime in his wet clothes andbeing half tipsywould pig like insist upon not changing themsaying that nothing ever hurt an English sportsman in the chasehe was taken the next day very ill and as I said before the re∣port now is that he is dead  So much for him God bless him and send him better off in the other world than he wished people to be in this  My next visitor was Mr Ego who with a long face and I think real concernbut there is no knowing any bodytold me that Miss Roe∣buck had certainly consented to have Mr Gloss that the wedding clothes were bespoke the li∣cence purchased and the day fixed  I thought it now high time I should begin to look about me and so put on my hat and cloak and went directly to Sir Sidney's house I saw both Miss and her very good her very wise friend Mrs Emma who has been bribed over to Gloss's side or I will never pretend to judge of any thing again Well I only begged to know from the  young lady's mouth whether the report I had heard was true She said it was I asked if it was true that the wedding cloaths were bespoke Yes was the answer again If the licence was ready Yes And when was the happy day to be The next day but one And now said Mrs Emma putting in her word you may carry this information to your friend and tell him  Here she repeated some nonsense from a book that I cannot remember but it was something about taking your enemy in their arms To make short of it I came away The appointed day was yesterday and I have this morning with my own eyes seen an account of the wedding in the newspapers  Therethere is your tender constant Miss Annette for you And now I can only say if it makes you uneasy one hour you are not the man of sense I take you for What the deuce are these people to plot together and creep and fetch and carry and destroy the health and peace of a young gentleman twenty times their bettersfor he let them think as they please would not break his word no that he would not for the world I'll assure them What would they have next But I am getting mad with them again  Oh my dear sir how I would be revenged if I was you I wish the story was true that you told that nasty fellow with all my heart I some∣times think it is only that the lady fell in love with you for that is more likely and if she had I am sure you would have more honour than to tell If it is true do dear sir marry her if only to spite them  I don't know what else to say As to the forty pounds you have stopt my mouth it is hard however that you will be so very proud Lord how could you write about decorating your apart∣ments for any body else A king could not de∣serve to have them so handsome as yourself I as∣sure you if I had not cried heartily I don't know what I should have done with myself when I came to that part of your letter  God bless you sir and send you as happy as you deserve to be and then you will be much happier than any of your Annettes could have made you I have not patience with them But come sir keep up your spirits for something tells me all is for the best Go things how they will you are sure of one true friend for I will work my fingers to the bone for you  Remember your promise that if you should want you will apply to me But why do I say remember your promise Did you ever forget a promise Besides you know you are not to cheat me though you do all the world I wish all the world had not so cheated you  Your most grateful friend And humble servant E MARLOW  Charles had so far cheated Mrs Marlow not∣withstanding her opinion of his honesty that he did not inform her of giving the bailiff five guineas as an accommodation fee nor his paying the costs all which together with the expence of his journey and passage sunk his stock to nineteen guineas but he had not the heart to curtail the old gentle∣woman of a single guinea  He was fitting in his lodging counting this sum and considering what he should do with it when the master of the house who had called at the post office by his desire brought him the foregoing letter  It is pity my time is now so precious that I can∣not give an accurate description of Charles's recep∣tion  of the news this letter contained No mad hero in romance ever played over such a number of cu∣rious gambols no not the madest copier of them all in the madest of his curvets and caprioles in the mountains of Morena The Fleming at whose house he lodged might have sworn he was a tum∣bler or a lunatic One moment he stampt and raved the next measured his length upon the floor then starting up he for about ten minutes took a fit of execrating all the world but most himself Next Gloss's throat was to be cut in short if all his incoherencies were to have been literally put in practice he would have annihilated Gloss pistolled Figgins called Sir Sidney an old fool upbraided Annette as the most infamous of her sex kicked Emma to the devil and then followed her himself for so we may fairly construe his saying he would nobly fall in their presence  When this storm had a little subsided he called the affrighted Fleming into his presence made an apology for his outrageous conduct and desired that a surgeon might be sent for At the same time he bid him take an account of some of the furniture which he had broken in his rage and which he ob∣served his landlord to eye with tokens of grief and astonishment as it lay scattered about the floor  The surgeon being come Charles told him in the most placid manner that he had heard some un∣pleasant news from England of the death of a rela∣tion that it had put him into that ferment which I have so imperfectly described and lest a fever should be the consequence he begged to be bled The surgeon perfectly approved of the precaution and immediately proceeded to work after which our hero went to bed where a comfortable potation advised by a physician and prepared by an apothe∣cary who seeing their brother professor enter the Fleming's house from the corner of a street where they were in deep consultation about the different construction of syringes dropt their controversy to follow him  These precautions operating with some calm undisturbed advice which our hero had by this time whispered to himself brought him into such a state of tranquillity that he pursued his journey the next morning and in due time arrived at the ancient city of Ghent Here he immediately looked for a lodging and at length fixed himself to his satisfaction in the upper apartments of an uphol∣sterer where the first floor was occupied by a French widow lady who had been settled there about a year and a half She was in but an indifferent state of health and paid an extraordinary price for her  apartment that she might not be disturbed with the noise of a family over her head This was however no objection to her landlord's reception of Charles who she was told was a perfect stranger and had no attendants Nor perhaps was it a bar to his ac∣commodation for ladies sick or well never start at a handsome young fellow that is to say as they do at toads and beetles The lady also first sighed and then smiled when her landlord added that the young gentleman seemed to be very unhappy but that he was certainly a man of some consequence and a most elegant and comely figure  CHAPTER II  CONTAINING BESIDES A VERY EXTRAORDINARY CHASE AND THE DETECTION OF THREE ROGUES AN APPARENT IMPOS∣SIBILITY THAT THIS HISTORY SHOULD END HAPPILY  CHARLES as had been his intention proclaimed himself to his landlord as a painter and expressed a wish to copy a few pictures if there could be any way of getting at them The landlord told him that the very lady who lodged in the first floor had two very capital ones and he had no doubt would lend them with great pleasure  The request was made to her and she returned for answer that the gentleman might see the pic∣tures and if then they were found to answer his purpose he was very welcome to copy them  To say truth both the gentleman and the lady though neither knew why were charmed at this in∣cident of the pictures for the lady had heard of no∣thing but the gentleman's parises and particularly  of the beauty of his person ever since he had come into the house and he had an irresistible curiosity to see a person as much sequestered from the world as himself and for probably as extraordinary rea∣sons He therefore returned a proper compliment and at a time perfectly convenient to herthat is to say when she had put on a new cap and other∣wise prepared for his receptionhe took the liberty of paying his respects to her  Neither Charles nor the lady would probably have made so much ceremonious preparation for this inter∣view if they had foreseen how intimately they were known to each other for they had scarcely met when she exclaimedfor women's perception as well as their tongues is always forwardest  'Good heavens Mr Hazard'  which he an∣swered as emphatically with  'God bless my soul Madame Combrie'  And then recollecting that she was said to be a widow he felt a singular mixed sensation of surprise and pleasure which gave a strange embarrassed awkwardness to his manner and prevented him from following up his excla∣mation with a compliment  Whether this proceeded from an inclination to enquire after Combrie which the knowledge of her present situation forbid I will not determineCertainly  the lady chose to interpret it in this light for she immediately said  'You look as if you would ask for poor Combrie Mr Hazard he is no more He had scarcely made me independant when I lost him but I am hastening after him and we shall one day yet be happy together'  Charles softened the conversation declared him∣self heartily sorry for her loss but begged she would not dwell upon any part of those circumstances which brought up the recollection of any thing that pained her on remembrance  She said she was obliged to him but she had long since learnt to be perfectly resigned to all that could happen and the conversation of such a friend as he had proved himself would be as agreeable to her as it had been unexpected  When Mrs Combrie was in the communicative vein our hero suffered her to inform him of the particulars relative to her affairs after the recovery of her fortune What Combrie had written of his going to England was but a feint for embarking at Rouen for Dunkirk where he arrived in safety he posted immediately for Brussels From Brus∣sels which they considered as too public a place they removed to Ypres but previous to this  Combrie took a journey to Amsterdam and there lodged their money At Ypres they lived two years and a half in perfect happiness and were blessed with a daughter who dying in the small pox her father who had never had that fatal dis∣temper and whose attention to his darling child was not to be prevented also fell sick and took that disorder in so dangerous a way as baffled every ex∣ertion of art In short in one week fortune left her deprived of a tender husband and a beautiful infant  'At the first shock' said she 'I thought I should not have lingered long after them My constitu∣tion has however been hitherto proof against the strongest grief that ever attacked a human heart but I am gradually declining and in a few months perhaps weeks shall follow poor Combrie'  Charles warned her against giving way to unne∣cessary melancholy advised her not to seclude her∣self from the world gave her every consolatory advice within his invention and concluded with the most fervent offers of his services in any way that she should think proper to command them  She said though she had good reason for suppos∣ing that her end was approaching she knew her  duty as a christian better than to accelerate it and to prove this she had empowered a capital house in Ghent to receive her money from the Dutch bank which as soon as she had in her hands it was her intention to pass over to England where perhaps the change of climate might restore her to health if not she should have done her duty and could then die contented  Charles greatly approved of her plan and as he really felt extremely sorry at the prospect of parting with a lady whom he had formerly so essentially served and whose case made her stand so much in need of friendship and consolation he manifested great anxiety in this business For one thing he determined to recommend her to the tender care of Mrs Marlow and in short though it was im∣possible to attend her himself he so laid out for her comfort and accommodation that it gave him no small pleasure to reflect that having once saved her fortune he should now in all probability save her life  This was the benevolent employment in a strange country of that horrid wretch who in his own was represented as a monster of iniquity for all which he received numberless thanks and many a grateful tear from the generous widow  One morning as he waited on her to communi∣cate some new scheme of pleasure he had been con∣triving for her he met on the stairs a man whom he was confident he had somewhere seen beforeHis surmises were presently realized into certainty when Madame Combrie informed him that the mer∣chant had been just with her with information that he expected one of his partners every day with the money  'You are to know' said she 'I ever was par∣tial to the English and these merchants who are of that country are the most sensible and feel∣ing men I ever knew They are men of business and therefore have a blunt honesty about them that I ever liked and then as to property and se∣curity I need only again say they are EnglishIn short I believe I could not have got into better hands than Bondham and company'  'Oh gracious God' exclaimed Charles 'what do you tell me For God's sake answer me Was that Bondham I met on the stairs'  'It was' said the lady  'Then by heaven and earth you are ruined madam' returned Charles 'Forgive me my dear lady forgive me I would not give you a moment's uneasiness not the  slightest shock but you have not an instant to lose You are in the hands of villains Stay is there an attorney near at hand Can a man be arrested in Austria by the plaintive himself for a debt contracted in England'  In short without any further elucidation our hero left the astonished Madame Combrie enquired out an attorney and lugged him along to the house of these merchants but alas they came a few minutes too late Bondham and Co having all de∣camped and after some fruitless enquiry it was ascertained they had taken their departure towards the frontiers  He returned to Madame Combrie in company with the attorney told her that his suspicions had been but too fatally confirmed and begged she would instantly empower him to do her justice in which case he would immediately follow these mis∣creants whom he well knew how to make an ex∣ample of  He entreated the attorney to accompany him to which he consented first making an agreement that he should be well satisfied for his trouble which only proves that attornies are attornies all the world over  The gentleman of the law then drew up a short instrument to give Charles sufficient power to act and the landlord and indeed half the townfor our hero had dealt about his curses pretty hand∣somely in the streetaccompanied post horses to the door at which Charles entreated Madame Com∣brie to make herself as easy as possible for added he  'I once madam saved your fortune and I will now retrieve it or perish in the attempt'  He then huddled a few necessaries together mounted his horse and with the attorney and the guide galloped away in the very track of the fu∣gitives They lost them however for more than the last fifty miles but coming to Amsterdam found that they had actually received all the money and embarked but six hours before for Harwich  'Never mind' cried out our hero 'we will follow them'  So saying he was directed to a skipper who at an exorbitant price supplied them with a sloop in which by Charles's direction they ran with a fair wind under the shore of a village at the mouth of the Colchester river Then taking the attorney and the skipper in a post chaise they stopt short of Harwich at the house of a magis∣trate to whom Charles related his story which was this that these men had defrauded him for∣merly  out of a large sum of money for which trans∣action he had fairly hold of them in England but he only wished to make his claim an instrument to rescue from them a still larger sum the property of a French lady which under false pretences they had drawn out of the bank at Amsterdam  The justice who happened to understand some∣thing of the law advised him to arrest them as the first step after which he said he would back our hero's pretensions with his whole authority and as his presence added to talking big might facili∣tate the hoped for success he ordered his carriage and willingly set out to accompany our hero upon his laudable design  The reader sees these men were the swindler formerly spoken of the bailiff who kept Charles's asylum for the unfortunate and his security A∣gainst the security he had a fair action of fifteen hundred pounds being the moiety of what had been forfeited Against the swindler he might go for the whole and also against the bailiff and as his business was to tamper with them as much as pos∣sible he sent an express for three separate writs which kept him though the utmost expedition was used upon the tenter hooks of fear and expectation lest his prey in the interim should escape  Before they had proceeded a single mile on the way they saw a post chaise at an alehouse door with a man watering the horses Presently Charles recognized Bondham by the side of a chaise He now called to the postillion to stop and pretend there was something the matter with the carriage thinking it would be more difficult to surprise them separately than together At the same time he begged the magistrate would drive slowly on and pass them so that they might be caught between two fires for they had an officer behind each of the carriages This was happily executed Charles's speaking to those in the other carriage was not at all suspicious for it only seemed mere curiosity from one which the other satisfied At the same time he hid his face and otherwise kept himself completely from a discovery which indeed was not difficult for the others suspected no snare  At length our hero had the satisfaction of seeing the three gentlemen enter the chaise which done he got out pretending to assist in setting the carri∣age to rights The Flemish attorney and postillion were also on their guard and as the other chaise drew near the latter with great dexterity left his work and unhorsed his fellow driver in an instant and then ran to the heads of the horses by which  time the attorney at one door and Charles at the other held their prisoners in safe custody  Pretending not to know Charles they called out  'What do you mean to rob us'  'No' said the officer who was by this time come up 'we want to prevent you from robbing other people I have separate actions against you to the tune of seven thousand five hundred pounds'  Nothing in nature is so cowardly as a detected viliain If he have a pistol in his hand he will fire it through desperation but if he be unarmed no slinking cur ever tucked his tail between his legs in so dastardly a manner  The swindler cocked his hat but that was all the security sweat and the bailiff trembled from head to foot By this time the magistrate joined them who exclaimed  'God bless my soul I find it is first come first served here I have a de∣mand upon these gentlemen Come mynheer stand forward'  The skipper began to jabber something that no∣body understood but the attorney who explained in French that he had a claim on them for defraud∣ing  the Dutch bank which our hero in a most in∣sulting tone translated for them into English  Next came a mock dispute between our hero and the magistrates Both claimed the gentlemen as their respective prisoners who in their turn be∣ginning to take a little courage demanded to see by what authority they were detained  The officer said archly he had no sort of objec∣tion if they had a fancy for it to expose them to every passenger on the road but he thought as they might be assured they were nailed fast enough it would be the best way to go forward to his worship's where every thing would be properly explained to them  'In short' added he 'here are the red tails and you may depend upon it I shan't let you out of my sight till you are safely lodged in Chelmsford jail I did my business first and if his worship wants you up afterwards upon other affairs that's none of my concern thousands are serious things and my mind won't be easy till I have fairly shopped you'  Several horsemen and others being seen at a dis∣tance the prisoners consented to go to his worship's where a very serious examination passed The  Dutch embassador's name and many others of very high authority were bandied about with great free∣dom At length there being in fact no possi∣bility of exhibiting a just claim on the part of Ma∣dame Combrie our hero contented himself with getting from them his original three thousand pounds upon undertaking by virtue of his power from that lady that no further demand on her ac∣count should be made against them in England  As I shall not be able to edge in a word by and by upon such paltry subjects I will drop these three gentlemen in this place for ever by saying that after this triumvirate came to Flanders they entered into trade at Ghent and under the ap∣pearance of a considerable property negociated money matters which they resolved to carry on with scrupulous honesty in order to beget them a character till an opportunity should offer of strik∣ing one stroke for all This they thought they could not more successfully practice than on a de∣fenceless widow  Having so laid their plot that it could not failnor indeed ever be known had not Charles so un∣expectedly come across themthey resolved to de∣camp and being arrived in England avail them∣  elves of a fraudulent bankruptcy first sharing the  whole of their effects in equal proportions This however they knew they could not do unless they previously came to a composition with our herofor in his affair there was evidently fraud collu∣sion and conspiracywhich they had no doubt but they should be able to do through a third person upon easy terms Fortune however ordained it otherwise as we have seen  As to what became of them afterwards the swin∣dler was one of the first of those who were trans∣ported to Botany Bay the security died of poverty in a prison and the bailiff attaching himself to an infamous prostitutewho first ruined and then be∣trayed himat length followed his honourable principal  After many sincere acknowledgments to the ma∣gistratewith whom they stayed all nightfor his uncommon attention and politeness our hero and the attorney reembarked after agreeing with the skipper to set them ashore at Ostend which would sooner bring them to the relief of Madame Com∣brie's suspense  On the road Charles let the attorney into his intention as to the report he should make of this business to the lady at which information what∣ever  it might be he testified much surprise and in∣deed began to think the young gentleman was turned fool but being convinced to the contrary by Charles's following the discovery with a reward he from that moment certainly had a very great re∣gard for our herofor he told him so  They found Madame Combrie in a much weaker state than she appeared to be in when they parted from her She listened however to the tale of their success with more unconcern than our hero ex∣pected whichfor the reader knows he was de∣termined now to impose upon peoplehe explained to be this  That they had overtaken the fugitives as we have mentioned and that being in England where it was impossible to obtain any legal redressfor the matter did not amount to a robbery they having received the money by her own orderhe had been under the unpleasant necessity of coming to a com∣position and of receiving three thousand pounds instead of almost double that sum  'Thank God you have recovered it madam' added Charles 'and let this narrow escape warn you in future how you trust to strangers'  He then displayed documents to the amount of  two thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds the rest he said having gone to defray different ex∣pences and recompence that gentlemanmeaning the Flemish attorneyfor the extraordinary pains and attention he had shewn in the whole affair finishing with a most florid eulogium on the genero∣sity and disinterestedness of this benevolent lawyer who hadstill like his brethren in other countrieseaten drank and slept well said yes and no and rather puzzled matters than explained them  Our honest attorney being gone Madame Com∣brie made a very long and very grateful speech by way of thanks to our hero Towards the conclu∣sion she uttered these words  'Seeing all this is the case that your own situa∣tion is so straitened'for Charles had told her every thing except indeed that he was in present ne∣cessity'that I stand in need of a protector and that I sincerely believe there is not a man upon earth of such generous such delicate honour as yourself let me offer you a right to call this money yours a right I do not blush to tender a right that should Combrie look down and see us at this moment he would cheerfully sanctify for he was good and benevolent like yourself'  'Take care madam what you offer' said our hero 'You do not however know all my situation My debts in England would consume nearly one third of this money but I own we might orna∣ment a most smiling cottage with the remainder'  'Lookee my dear Mr Hazard' said the lady I may not live in which case who can this mo∣ney so worthily belong to as yourself I hold it at present but as a trust'the poor lady how∣ever did not know how nearly she approached to the truth'and as were it fifty times that sum were you without a sixpence in possession or ex∣pectancy it should court your acceptance so I can now only grieve that its insignificance reflects no merit on my offer'  'Madam' said Charles more seriously 'you know my fatal devotion to a false and ungenerous young lady'  for I must explain here Charles's delicacy never would permit him to name Annette  'I do' said the lady  'You know I can never love another as I have loved her'  'This also I both admit and admire' said the lady  'You know it is not in my power to offer you more than the most servent friendship'  'Which in you' said Mrs Combrie 'has for me more charms than the most violent love in any other  man'  'You know I have not a friend in the world and that my fortune is ruined'  'Talk of something that will enhance the value of my offer' said the lady  'Knowing this if you will take me' exclaimed Charles with the greatest warmth 'I am yours and heaven's my witness nothing shall surpass the fidelity and admiration of the best husband that ever devoted himself to the most disinterested and generous of women and now my charming angelic creaturefor no∣thing is so young and beautiful as goodnesslet us first be married and then to England where our cottage shall be thronged with joys unknown to emperors'  It is almost unnecessary to add that the lady was charmed with this conduct or that the very next day they became man and wife  CHAPTER III  IN WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS THE PARSON IS OBLIGED TO GIVE WAY TO THE DOCTOR  HAVING at this ticklish period married my hero greatly I doubt not to the disappointment of some readers I shall leave him and his sick wife who really seem to be fit company for each other and return to England from whence we have lately heard of a wedding in a very different style  That I may be as succinct as possible I shall take the matter up earlier than when Mrs Marlow left Annette so highly in dudgeon and so come roundly to that point which I must tell the reader happened to be a remarkably critical one  The reader will readily recollect the conversation between Mr Ego and Mrs Marlow which of course was only an echo of what continually passed at Sir Sidney's and contained a very inconsiderable part of those manoeuvres which Mr Gloss daily put in practice to deceive the good baronet  He had however a much harder task to perform for Annette and even Emma must be shaken in their allegiance to this king of their hearts before he could stand the smallest chance of moulding them to his purpose To do this he watched all our hero's actions and when he set on foot his news∣paper employed an agent to purchasevirtually for him howeverone of the shares This it is not difficult to divine was the man who arrested him and from whom he obtained his liberty upon the terms of his going abroad which had he not been so precipitate in proposing himself would have been offered to him  The person who held this share of the paper for Mr Gloss appeared to be a great favourer of the scheme and was one of the last who seceded both of which steps were good policy because one en∣abled him to do the paper a great deal of private in∣jury and the other kept all its secrets within his knowledge to the last moment  When the paper was put down the other daily prints began as I have already said to bespatter our hero who after the business of the challenge that he might not be provoked by them read no∣thing they inserted On that account the follow∣ing paragraph totally escaped his notice which was  given to the public about four days before Annette paid Charles that visit the nature of which it is now my business to explain  PARAGRAPH  We advise a certain baronet with that warmth and interest the nature of so extraordinary a case and his excellent character deserve to look with every possible caution to the security of his amia∣ble daughter's person who notwithstanding her exemplary devotion to the will of a tender father may nevertheless be surprised by the machina∣tions of a certain young newspaper adventurer who that his mischievous brain may be always at workhaving given over attacking celebrated and established public productionsis now turn∣ing his thoughts to a scheme which unless the parties are extremely wary will destroy by force that domestic peace which he could not under∣mine by art  This paragraph in the usual pompous style had scarcely appeared when two or three strange fellows were watching about Sir Sidney's house and one was seen in the garden but he made his escape over the wall before the servant could come up with  him To say truth Sir Sidney was not a little alarmed Indeed Annette herself could not help testifying some surprise and as to Emma though her sentiments were perfectly decided she kept them to herself for some freedoms Mr Gloss had about that time provoked her to take drew from Sir Sidney what amounted to almost a declaration of dismissing her his house upon a repetition of such liberties  Until the upshot of our hero's villanous stratagem should be known Sir Sidney proposed that they should all go into the country for a few days and the place made choice of was Richmond where they had been repeatedly invited by an old friend of the baronet  Mr Gloss having carried his point thus far the accomplishment of his scheme waited only for its  coup de grace  This was performed in the following manner  As Annette was strolling in the garden to enjoy the sweet serenity of a moonlight night and not to hide the truth to reflect on her love for our hero who now she began to fear would never be hers and what was worse never deserve to be hers two men suddenly came behind her Having taken  their measures like adepts in their business she was completely prevented from either struggling or alarming any of the family and in a very few mi∣nutes placed between the strangers in a post chaise  These gentlemen told her with many assevera∣tions to back the truth of their assertions that no harm was intended her that she was only to be carried to Squire Hazard's house in London who Lord bless his heart for he was a worthy gentle∣man loved her better than he did his eyes and who this orator said it was his belief intended to marry her that very night or stick himself before her face  Annette with prayers and entreaties begged they would carry her back again Her pride was deeply wounded at this poor this paltry scheme of stealing her from her father and I must own and com∣mend her for it at the same time that she had at that moment a contemptible opinion of CharlesAt the same time she could not think that she ran the smallest risk as to her honour She could easily see she should be pursued and as her father and Mr Gloss were already upon their guard probably overtaken before they should arrive at the end of their journey  With these ideas in contemplation Annette bore her misfortune with something like composure which so won in appearance on her conductors that they began to plead the cause of our hero very forcibly not but they allowed it was a little hard to oblige a young lady to do any thing against her will even though it was to please herself One of them pretended to be so attached to her interest that he would tell her Lord love her pretty face all how the thing was that she might better know what to make of matters when she should see young Squire Hazard This well concerted fiction was nothing more than fancying what a man would na∣turally do who saw as it were a young lady fly into his very arms He said at first sight our hero would appear very much astonished at seeing her He would then pretend to suppose the whole busi∣ness was her act and deed  'Ay' said she 'but he shall not have time to do that'  Upon that circumstance they hitched their whole hope of success If once Charles and Annette should begin to quarrel every word must widen the breach northat our hero might have as much embarrassment as possiblewas the time pitched upon a slight article in this mass of contri∣vance When could it be put in execution to such good effect as at that moment when his mind was  perturbed distracted and broken to pieces by re∣flecting on his successless attempts at independancy and when he waswhich is SHAKESPEARE's doubt magnifiedflying from ills he had to rush on others that he knew not of  All these matters so artfully conceived so nicely combined and so certain in their effect could not fail of producing exactly what we have seen It is needless to say that Mr Gloss kept the post chaise in sight all the way for he mounted his horse the moment they were fairly off leaving word with a servant to tell Sir Sidneywho he had taken care should be at some distancethat seeking him and explaining matters would take up too much time but that Miss Roebuck was stolen away by Mr Hazard and he was set out to follow them He therefore advised him to come to town himself with all expedition but not to be under the least appre∣hension for he would restore the young lady or lose his life in the attempt There was something a little awkward in not taking the baronet with him but there would have been risk in it and the strong circumstances which would afterwards come out must he knew completely cover any inaccu∣racy that in a contrivance of so complicate a na∣ture was of course indispensible  When Annette got home and Sir Sidney heard her inveigh against our hero and extol in the highest terms of panegyric the generosity and gal∣lantry of Gloss he ran over with pleasure He al∣most pitied the poor desperate devil who had been put to so pitiful so unavailing a piece of villanous folly so ill contrived that it defeated its own end He launched out into the most grateful flow of warmth and energy in praise of Gloss and told his daughter that she could no longer refuse to give him her hand Grant he said that this young mon∣ster had formerly made an impression on her heart it was now as much a duty she owed herself as him to tear from her mind all traces of a passion that could reflect on her only unworthiness and disho∣nour an affection for an unprincipled villain and a paltry coward  Indeed nothing had set Sir Sidney so much against Charles as his having refused to accept the challenge especially after Gloss had reminded him that one of his ancestors in the reign of one of the Edwards had at a tournament fought a duel by the king's authority  Mr Gloss was not yet however contented He would seek for more proofs against Mr HazardThe affection of such a young lady as Miss Roe∣buck  could not but be decided let it be placed ever so unworthily No pains ought to be spared to restore ease to so gentle a heart a heart that it should be the whole devotion of his life to merit  The next day he pretended to enquire about Charles and found to his great astonishmentfor so he told Sir Sidneythat he had somehow or other got rid of the bailiff and slipt away to France Another day or two was taken to enquire into the particulars of this transaction Every moment of all this time Sir Sidney was making preparations for the wedding Annette being yet wavering and unresolved till on the morning of that day when Mrs Marlow called at Sir Sidney's by the greatest good luck in the world the bailiff and the two bail were found out and brought before Sir Sid∣ney to whom they offered to make oath that Charles was gone abroad to be married and pro∣duced the bond as a corroboration of what they asserted  Annette without hesitation now consented to the marriage to do which she mustered up so strong a portion of resolution and wore such ap∣parent content in her features that except now and then a sigh she betrayed no sort of repugnance be∣fore company as to what was going forward  Emma however was not even yet deceived but what could avail her feeble voice in a multitudethat is to say in mere reasoning for if she had spoken out it would have been in thunderespecially pro∣hibited as she was from speaking It was on this account she desired Mrs Marlow while Annette was at the other end of the room to tell Charles  'that his enemy was now an Antaeus in the arms of Hercules'  This the good lady did not understand or could not remember otherwise it might have made some alteration in Charles's conduct And now came the moment as Emma thought for her to step for∣ward She gloried in the opportunity and the more her adversaries approached to an host the stronger she found herself against them  Her grand coup de theatre however was for the present postponed for at six o'clock on that very morning Annette was to have been made a bride it was the opinion of every one about her that she would never be married but to her grave She was seized with so violent a fever accompanied by so strong a delirium that her father Lady Roebuck three physicians and an apothecary were fully of opinion she could not live till the canonical hour  Mr Gloss however to work as secretly as possible did not fail to blaze in the papers with an account of the wedding no circumstance being omitted to hyperbolize the splendid talents of the bridegroom or the fortune beauty and accomplishments of the daughter of that truly patriotic and independant country gentleman Sir Sidney Walter Roebuck the oldest title of baronet in the kingdom  Annette's illness in compliment to Charlesthough it was no more than what had happened to him in compliment to herhad like to have had effects as dangerous as they were sudden For a whole fortnight nobody expected she would reco∣ver After that time however though she certainly exhibited tokens of convalescence yet her mind had been so rudely shocked as to leave the recovery of her intellects a very doubtful business They were at length so far restored as to sadden into a settled placid melancholy which left her a pale and mournful example of sensible and unshaken constancy  Mr Gloss began now to be afraid that providence had determined to defeat what he had defied the impuissant art of man to destroy Yet that nothing might be wanted on his part he was indefatigable  to procure intelligence of our hero's motions when at length through Ego he learnt of his marriage Ego himself having been informed of it by Mrs Marlow  Emma finding that this marriage was no coun∣terfeit like the rest began in earnest to fear that all was over To satisfy herself of the particulars she called on Mrs Marlowfor now she was de∣termined to keep no measuresand was by her shewn the letters from our hero by which she plainly saw he had fallen a victim to the arts of Gloss Her heart bled for him She perceived he had entailed misery on himself through the best pride and the noblest honour that ever young man possessed His case therefore appeared to be des∣perate  This however she conceived ought for the sake of her young lady rather to accelerate than retard her measures which she was now resolved to go about fully and fairly especially as to give expe∣diency to them she had through Mrs Marlow though unknown to that good woman made a strong corroborative discovery of one of those facts through which she expected to carry her point  Emma compared herself to General Monk say∣ing  she was determined to strike no stroke till she should be sure of success  Having now however collected her whole force into one point of view she marched forward and without a single hostile movement obtained a de∣cisive victory  In other words Sir Sidney no sooner heard what she had to alledge backed with such convincing proofs than no man upon earth ever took such blame to himself or conceived such an inveterate enmity to another as he did to Mr Gloss Indeed had not the discovery Emma made involved matters of still greater importance which were not yet quite ripe for public examination nothing could have restrained the baronet from making of his quondam favourite an immediate and most severe example As it was he fairly inlisted under General Emma who though she feared she should not put her King Charles in possession of that throne Annette's per∣son yet she was now sure of restoring the happiness of that kingdom Sir Sidney's family whose interest she had so dearly at heart  Poor Annette could enjoy none of this A heavy languor pervaded her senses She received every thing that was said to her with beautiful attention  and solemn innocence but gave no tokens of col∣lected comprehension except answering with a sigh any passage of tenderness and now and then letting fall a pearly tear with alwaysin a faint but sweet accentthe exclamation of  'I am sure poor Charles is not a villain'  CHAPTER IV  CONTAINS A REPENTANT SINNER AND AN EXPIRING SAINT  As Emma's provident conduct with her prin∣cipal General Monk in view seems to be an ex∣ample worthy imitation I shall here so far follow it as to bring into one focus such objects as will conduce to an elucidation of what to some may have appeared extraneous  As however early in this history I disclaimed the idea of introducing any thing foreign to the sub∣jectindeed I must have been very absurd if I had introduced any such thing for I have full matter enough that honestly appertains to itI will not give what I am now going to explain the appellation of extraneous but leading circumstances  To effect some part of this purpose I shall now give a brief account of Mr Figgins from the time he bid our hero adieu at Lyons to the period to which this history is advanced The reader knows  that the gentleman I am speaking of was heartily glad to quit Charles and return to England To this however he was induced by a motive among others of a better kind than has been yet explained He was then doing or rather professing to do what we are told by the highest authority is im∣possible namely serving two masters and which to keep that incomparable idea in view was lite∣rally speaking God and Mammon In short his compacts with Charles and Mr Standfast were very opposite things yet to the one he was obliged and to the other willing to adhere  Mr Figgins had not sufficiently considered that however vice may have its allurements there is yet something so pure so winning in virtue and ho∣nour that a man stands a chance of becoming a convert to it even thoughlike an advocate who pleads a cause he has no opinion ofhe should only maintain the subject by way of mere argument  Thus it happened to Mr Figgins for he very often caught himself in the very act of seriously admiring our hero when his agreement was to serve his enemies  He did not flinch however as we have seenHe discharged his trust to the very letter of it and  then claimed what had been promised him a living of two hundred a year to be added to his other income  Finding however that Mr Standfast's perfor∣mance of this promise depended upon the interest of Zekiel who as we have seen upon his accession to his fortune left him fairly in the lurch Mr Figgins began to see he had been a rogue for nonothing He could not notwithstanding blame Mr Standfast whose loss was still heavier yet he was determined to shake of that tyrannical yoke whichin consequence of a few favours conferred on him in his youth out of which by the way the other had had his gleaningsStandfast had so hea∣vily laid on his shoulders To do this with perfect propriety was however no easy task nor would he have been able to effect it with any prospect of real satisfaction to himself or advantage to others if he had not thought of a coalition with Emma  To this Mr Figgins was stimulated by various motives Mr Standfast had unbent his mind a good deal before him and particularly in an al∣tercation one day with Mrs O'Shocknesy when such hints were thrown out as obliged him in his mind to take a decided part on the spot  A few days after this he received intelligence from Mr Balance of the handsome way in which our hero had settled on him a hundred a yearThis determined him to take an  active  part The consideration that all his dirty work had been paid by a disappointment and that the very man he had assisted to cheat had conferred on him such an un∣expected and unmerited benefit worked strongly in his heart It reproached him with being a ras∣cal a despicable low shuffling villain In short like Harry Hotspur's starling nothing sleeping or waking was dinned in his ears by his conscience but such opprobrious sounds till at length the conslict abated and he tasted the pleasure of feeling himself an honest man  To do our hero any thing like justice he saw was a most tremendous task indeed and of this he soon convinced Emma who said it was plain the at∣tempt and not the deed would confound them  The reader will admit that circumstances half disclosed lead to such a maze of apparently differ∣ent meanings that the chances are infinitely against coming at the truth by pursuing any one of them No wonder then they were frequently thrown out and unable to proceed with certainty to any thing further than what Sir Sidney was now acquainted  with and which as it related only to the downfal of Mr Gloss and our hero's reconciliation with the baronet was but a trifle in comparison of what they were sure by patience and perseverance they might achieve  Besides to say the truth they were willing to let Charles go the length of his tether There was such redundancy of goodness in his mind that it was absolutely necessary he should know the world practically that he should feel experience They thought they could marry him to Annette when∣ever they pleased but here indeed they reckoned without their host though it must be owned not without good sense for nothing could be so unlike∣ly as that he should take so extraordinary a step though as matters turned out I hope the reader does not think it extraordinary at all  Thus then their plot rolled on like a snow ball till Annette began to be actually in danger for then it was found necessary for Figgins to act overtly towards Charles in proportion as Emma observed the same conduct with Sir Sidney For this purpose he called at Charles's housefor he was the stranger of whom Mrs Marlow speaks in her letterwith the news of his brother's dangerous illness which  was no invention but actually a fact and to con∣firm what is there imperfectly given I now inform the reader that Master Zekielto use the landlord's expression at the John of Gauntbegan to rub off the rust of his ancestors by leaving the world three days after the sporting accident before spoken of upon which Mr Tadpole took possession at the Lady Dowager's desire for the eldest son lawfully begotten by Lord Hazard till he should arrive to the age of one and twenty and in case of his death for the younger  Mr Gloss however who could see as well and as far as either Mr Figgins or Mrs Emma took care as we have seen to defeat the whole end of this friendly visit It was however repeated the day after Mrs Marlow wrote to Charles when Mr Figgins explained himself as far as he thought neces∣sary and among the rest told the good old lady that he had three hundred and fifty pounds belong∣ing to the young gentleman which he wanted to remit him which money to shew to what a de∣gree Figgins was become honest was the very identical annuity as far as he had received it which Charles had settled on him and which he vowed to the Almighty in the presence of Emma he would not touch a shilling of till he had like a man of  honour confessed his former conduct to Charles himself implored his pardon and by some wor∣thy atonement merited his friendship  Upon this subject he incessantly besieged Mrs Marlow and indeed so did Emma till finding they were real friendsfor as Emma told her  'he who gives money seldom feigns'  the old gentle∣woman became as anxious to bring about this recon∣ciliation as Figgins to desire it But how was this to be done Our hero's proceedings had been so sudden and extraordinary that he had no opportu∣nity of writing till he was ready to come to En∣gland and then he thought it unnecessary for lest his wife should become weaker they packed up their alls and began their journey in a day or two after their marriage so that not one syllable came from Charles to Mrs Marlow till she re∣ceived the following letter from Rochester  TO Mrs MARLOW AT  MY GOOD MARLOW  I intended to have surprised you with my presence but it cannot be I am not how∣ever sick except at heart nor is my person in  danger on the contrary the wishedfor com∣petency is already obtained As however it is impossible to come on to you you must come and that immediately to me for I want you in a case where all your attentive tenderness and sym∣pathy will be necessary I am sure I need not urge you further  I have volumes to tell you therefore you can know nothing till we meet only this that I am married so Mrs Gloss has not so completely triumphed as perhaps she imagines for you see I can even write her damned name with all the com∣posure in the world  Yours most faithfully C HAZARD  Call at the Bell  Mrs Marlow who had though innocently been herself the cause of what our hero had done was in a sit of distraction at the receipt of this letterShe thought every door was now barred between Charles and that which could alone procure his hap∣piness  In this situation she was found by Figgins who in vain administered every possible consolation to  her She said she was an ungrateful woman a wrongheaded impatient wretch who in return for saving her and hers from wretchedness and mi∣sery had wantonly though heaven knew not wickedly heaped destruction on the head of her be∣nefactor  At length however they both considered that to lose a moment's time would be committing a real crime while she was only accusing herself of an imaginary one It was therefore determined that they should both set out in the same post chaise and that Figgins should begin his attack on our hero's sensibility in the presence of Mrs Marlow who had so much to say in his desence Indeed they most seriously promised to be each other's advocate though both knew there was not a tenderer nor more merciful heart upon earth and this was a greater consolation to Figgins than to Mrs Mar∣low for he well knew how sublimely our hero ex∣celled in all noble and generous exertions while she was convinced that this very sweetness in him would be her bitterest sorrow for the readier he might be to forgive her the more unwilling should she be to forgive herself and indeed both of these reflections were perfect in their kind for one had been guilty of crimes which to procure peace of  mind must be pardoned and forgotten whereas the other was only an error which ought to be re∣membered that it might not be repeated  I shall now leave our hero's friend and house∣keeper on the road to Rochester and see how he himself came there as well as explain why he could not reach London The matter will be understood when I say that having determined to visit En∣gland immediately after the wedding he and his lady set out by short stages to Ostend for it was yet possible that it might be dangerous for her to set her foot in France and it was his business not to do any thing that could give her the smallest ap∣prehension This journey was also taken as soon as possible for marriage had not by any means abated the good lady's disorder on the contrary she visibly became worse every day which was not perhaps a little facilitated by a discovery of our hero's trick as to the fortune  In short the attorney looking upon the trans∣action as a kind of miracle proclaimed it from one to another till at length it came to the lady's ears who finding that very generosity performed by another of which she hoped to reap all the glory herself grewso perverse is human naturevery unhappy at it Not that she repined at being de∣pendant  on such a husband for she spoke of his greatness of soul with a kind of adoration but her tender heart melted to think that she could give nothing in return for such goodness but trouble uneasiness and sorrow That a perfect youth rich in all the gifts of nature and blest with heaven's best endowments should be fated to drag on a life of sadness and receive only the feeble endearments of unavailing gratitude when the willing and inspir∣ing love of the handsomest and best woman upon earth would be infinitely beneath his merits  Some other female considerations perhaps lent these a little strength Mrs Hazard was many years older than her husband her illness had not altered her person to her advantagefor she cer∣tainly had been a very beautiful womanand the consciousness that she could not render him that at∣tention her wishes prompted her to finished her wretchedness a settled gloom pervaded her mind and she pined at heart that she could only give thanks where it would have delighted her soul to have bestowed worlds  There was however a stronger reason than any of these Her disorder had taken deep hold on her before she saw Charles and when she set out for England it had become a serious business Our  hero therefore before he took this step had a con∣sultation of physicians who privately assured him that whatever was done could be considered only as an experiment for that her end though it seemed at some small distance evidently appeared but too certain A voyage to England therefore was by no means unadvisable for certainly they had known change of air and a passage by sea bring about ex∣traordinary cures and that if it should have the contrary effect he would have the consciousness of recollecting the integrity of his own intentions in a business where fate at last was to decide  Mrs Hazard arrived at Ostend tolerably well considering her situation and Charles after resting two or three days to find a convenient vessel and choose calm weather handed her on board a sloop bound for Dover Their passage however was ren∣dered both tedious and troublesome by an altera∣tion of the wind which suddenly chopt about and blew almost a gale Charles was himself very sick but his wife's situation was dreadful on which he was congratulated by several passengers who said they were sure it would restore the lady's health Those however who entertain this opinion are egre∣giously mistaken for how can straining and lace∣rating the stomach be of service to it I shall not at any rate pretend to say farther on this subject  here than that it had on this good lady an effect very different from that prognosticated for she had scarcely landed at Dover after a passage of seventeen hours when she was seized with fainting fits which followed one another at different inter∣vals for three days after which she grew more equal in her symptoms being neither so high nor so low in spirits  In this equanimity of mind she thought she could very well proceed on her journey and both she and our hero flattered themselves that after this crisis of her disorder it would take a favoura∣ble turn They therefore set out making short stages or as the postillion from the ship who had been a sailor called it trips  At length the whole hopes of both Charles and his lady were frustrated for she had scarcely got into the inn at Rochester when she was again seized with her fainting fits which continued in so long and so alarming a succession that the worst conse∣quences were greatly feared Charles therefore wrote as we have seen immediately to Mrs Mar∣low till whose arrival he becameas indeed he had been all alonga tender and affectionate husband a consoling and instructive companion and what was perhaps as much to his honour as either a  watchful and attentive nurseand in this senti∣ment I will insist for upon the same principle in a state that the bustle of war is only necessary in proportion as it promotes the blessings of peace so he is the greatest man who can relish after the exertions of his public duty in a still more exalted degree the felicity arising from domestic tranquil∣lity  CHAPTER V  WHERE THE READER WILL PAY A MELANCHOLY VISIT TO ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL  WHEN Mrs Marlow arrived at Rochester Mrs Hazard was at the last extremity so that the good old lady had little more to do than to close her eyes  Mrs Hazard's whole conduct throughout her illness had been touching and exemplary Charles though he did not love her with ardour yet loved her with a better affection than do nine husbands out of ten love their wives He found himself pos∣sessed of a woman capable of making any man happy and with whom he had flattered himself he should pass a life of sober rational delight Again she was a kind of outcast like himself and their fortunes by a similar chain of circumstances pointed them out as fit partners for each other It is not justice then to say he barely regretted her loss He mourned it honestly sincerely mourned it Indeed so much that had he been given his choice  to have had her restored to life or Annette un∣married he would not have hesitated a moment so much was generosity in him above selfinterest  All that he could now do was to pay what respect was in his power to her memory He procured her to be buried in the cathedral had a small but elegantly designed monument erected over her grave drew the design and wrote the epitaph him∣self in which was prettily introduced her maiden name her name by her first marriage and that which she owned when she died concluding that he disconsolate as he was evidently deserved her less than either her father or her first husband for she had fled from him to join them  This image poetically put had as the reader sees capabilities and Charles so improved upon them that his pen did not shame his conception  These preparations took up nearly seven weeks for Charles would not stir from the spot till he had seen them finished The exemplary conduct of so respectable a young man drew a crowd of friends about him and his lodgings were thronged with a number of the first people in the neighbourhood who called on him with compliments of condolence all which he received with an unaffected dignity  peculiar to himself till at length having settled every thing to his satisfaction he left Rochester with the title of The pattern for husbands'  All this train of circumstances I thought it better to dispatch at once than to introduce Figgins be∣fore I could give him a clear course  When Figgins and Mrs Marlow came within a mile of Rochester it was agreed that he should get out and saunter slowly on in order that she might break the ice for him When she came to the Bell however a waiter was sent with her to Charles's apartments where being immediately conducted to the lady's chamber and finding her in the condi∣tion I have described all ideas of any other cir∣cumstance or person upon earth utterly fled from her She thought no more of Mr Figgins than of the man in the moon On his part when he came to the inn and upon enquiry found how matters were he felt that he could not have chosen a more improper moment than the present and therefore determined to wait a day or two or till he should hear from Mrs Marlow  The next morning however Mrs Hazard's death happened and when Mrs Marlow had re∣freshed  herself after her fatigues with a little sleep it came into her mind that Figgins must be at the inn  It will readily be seen that this event sad as it was had abated Mrs Marlow's anger against her∣self for both our hero and Annette being at that moment single the mischief she had done was as she thought not now irretrievable  It was a sad moment to be sure but still her tongue itched to inform Charles that Sir Sidney was his friend and that there was no further obstacle except poor Annette's unhappy indisposition to the completion of his wishes She could not however help throwing out a few hints This she took an opportunity of doing that very evening while Charles was contemplating with sober awful atten∣tion the features of the poor lady who was then ly∣ing in her shroud After a long and silent exami∣nation of that dreary state of sad mortality that state so much courted yet so little desired an invo∣luntary sigh escaped him and he uttered  'There certainly is a resemblance'  'A resemblance of what' said Mrs Marlow near whom he did not seem conscious he was then standing  'Oh' said Charles starting 'I had forgot you  were here What did you say'  'Nay' said she 'I asked you what you said'  'Upon my word I have forgot' answered Charles 'but I know I was thinking that poor Annette here'  'Annette' said Mrs Marlow 'no thank God she is not here nor in this shocking state An∣nette Lord sir what made you think of Miss Annette'  'Miss Annette' said Charles 'Is she not'  'No that she is not' cried the good old lady 'she is not married nor has she been It was a report and a lie circulated by that devil Gloss and three days after I had written you word of it I could almost have cut off the very fingers that held the pen which wrote such false news No sir thank God that villain's reign is over Sir Sidney will beg your pardon and you will be re∣stored to his friendship'  Charles stood in such astonishment while he heard these words that he could not prevent her uttering them The moment she had done so how∣ever he replied  'I hope all this may be found true but it would be indecent indeed at present to enter into it further The most desirable ex∣pectation upon earth should not prevent me from doing my duty here'  'Ay ay you again' said Mrs Marlow 'God bless you for it Will any body make me believe you won't at last be perfectly happy But I beg your pardon I won't say another word only this that poor Mr Figgins has repented of all his villany and you have not a better friend in the world'  'Figgins' said Charles 'Impossible'  'In∣deed sir it is not' said Mrs Marlow 'for he is now at the inn and dares not come into your pre∣sence for fear you should not pardon him al∣though he would lay down his life to receive for∣giveness at your hands'  She then produced the three hundred and fifty pounds and began to enumerate so many proofs of his conversion that Charles in spight of himself heard her to an end and when he had done so was upon the point of dispatching a messenger to Figgins to see him immediately but Mrs Mar∣low said it would be better to send to him that night but not to appoint him till the morning for he would be greatly affected at a proposal of being kindly received and it would give a little time to prepare him for such a meeting  This was well put in by Mrs Marlow for it en∣sured  Figgins a kind message which must inevita∣bly be the harbinger of a reconciliation  The next morning the breakfast things upon the table and our hero sitting thoughtfully while he looked at a book which he could pay no attention to Figgins was ushered in by Mrs Marlow He was beginning with a low inclination of the body to make a speech when our hero taking him by the hand interrupted him with  'Mr Figgins I beg I may not hear a single retrospective word If it can be possible that you ever did me any ill office it must have been through the blind influence of false gratitude Sense of obligation to a rascal made you perhaps a little unjust yourself It is not till lately I have seen this nor did you very likely at the time At any rate my mind is now in no state for investigations therefore I beg our conversation may be on no topic that may divert it from that object on which it is fixedFor the rest I freely give you my hand and as I am sure we ever had a regard for each other let it in future continue without interruption'  'My incomparable friend exactly' said Figgins Oh God sir I wish you would permit me to give way to what I feel But I suppress it Yet I shall never be happy till by shewing you what I  have been you shall see what I truly am How could Ibut I have done Only let me say that this is the happiest moment of my life because it is the most honourable'  After some hours Charles began to be greatly pleased at having Figgins with him in this extre∣mity He had suffered much poignant uneasiness from reflecting that he was again without a single friend Figgins had been the only man he had ever considered in that light To him he had given his unreserved confidence The lighter and more youthful of his pleasures had been pursued in his company which though perhaps not the most wor∣thy yet are unceasingly the most endearing In short Charles was melancholy he was fatigued at heart by looking at nothing but unpleasant pros∣pects real pain and certain disappointment Not that his grief was of that very apparent kind which pained every body who witnessed it He had no opinion of that sorrow which vents itself in cries and lamentations His was ardent and honest but it was decent and manly Thus no friend ever came more opportunely With Figgins he could divide it from him he could receive as much consolation as such grief was capable of admitting There were collateral considerations also that weighed in this business Figgins had known poor Combrie had  assisted in obtaining that very fortune part of which Charles had now in his possession and it gave him a melancholy pleasure to reflect that their returning friendship would be cemented by so awful a cir∣cumstance as Figgins's performing the last mourn∣ful rites to the poor deceased lady  Thus consoled Charles consulted his friend in every step he took and they both became so fond of their solemn office that no other subject in∣truded itself till after the day that hid the lady's cares within the silent tomb  Into that tomb however I shall not descend nor shall I say any thing more about it than that from the moment it was completed to Charles's satisfac∣tion no stranger ever visited Rochester cathedral but was particularly shewn it and told its history  From the interment to the time of their quitting Rochester Figgins took every opportunity of open∣ing his grand battery which he begged he might preface with a history of himself that his friend might see what sort of men there were in the world and how easy it was to pass art and wickedness for wisdom and goodness He assured Charles it would take a burthen off his mind that never could be lightened but by a free confession that it was the  only lurking uneasiness that remained and that once dissipated he should never again suffer a single moment's care but on the contrary if he were prohibited from the only means that could relieve his mind his whole life would be imbittered with the recollection that his happiness was incomplete  At length Charles growing more and more com∣posed in his mind Figgins was permitted to say what he pleased which favour obtained he began as follows  'My dear sir let me premise to you never take into your favour a man whose origin or education has placed him in the way of imbibing low or vulgar prejudices In proportion as he has abi∣lity enough to think for himself he will from a captious consciousness of inferiority fancy him∣self in as natural a state of warfare with his supe∣riors as the crow does with the eagle and will supply in cunning what he wants in strength  'These being his affections should an opportu∣nity serve of mending his fortune what are then his reflections Why truly that superior talents have done that for him which ungrateful fortune neglected to do He therefore transfers the obli∣gation from himself to his patron and with all  the low cunning of a tricking servant he will do his utmost to undermine that interest it is his duty to promote At the same time there are some few examples to the contrary Very few how∣ever for he the world calls an upstart is very feldom indeed known to be grateful  'How must it be then when one lowly born bred in a school situate in the midst of every species of wickedness stimulated to all the licentious prac∣tices of broils and riots and practised only in art and craftiness meets at his setting out in the world with a man who makes a point of chusing him out for this very unluckiness and who means to use no part of his qualities but those which are to disgrace him in the eye of every honest man  'These are the portraits of Mr Standfast and myself I think not my birth a disgrace for my parents were honest I think not my education an unavailing one because I imbibed the same prin∣ciples of learning as I should have done at the best school but as till I was almost a man I mixed with none but the most filthy vulgar what won∣der if low cunning and subtle artifice made up my mind for how but by the use of such talents could I ever hope to rise in the world And  then as if a single spark of virtuewhich God knows I honestly believed had no existence but in ideawas likely to check this worthy belief in stept Mr Standfast who assured me that no man not born to a fortune ever rose to one without certain talents which he called superior genius but which I now denominate rascality  'In short I was to be placed about you as a sort of evil genius and to give me as much power as possible over you that is to say as much hold as possible on your generosity you were to seduce my sister and I was to overlook it whereas I never had a sister nor was that woman any more than a common creature of the town In short all you saw at my house was a delusion calculated for the purpose of introducing you to me and giving you fresh apparent proofs of Mr Standfast's attach∣ment probably lest you should discover the vil∣lany he happened then to be practising against your father'  Here Mr Figgins gave a copious detail of all the reader knows already relative to the measures carried into effect by him and Standfast both a∣gainst Charles and his father honestly stating how far he took shame to himself in this business  and shewing when he first began to feel repug∣nance  In short he did not omit a circumstance which I have already related and having fairly opened our hero's eyes as to Gloss Sir Sidney and every one else concluded with assuring him that the ba∣ronet was ready to take him heartily by the hand make him a concession for his unkind and unme∣rited coolness and beg to be admitted into his friendship with more warmth than ever  Figgins wound up this period pretty warmly and then added  'to which happy reconciliation it is needless to say will succeed your marriage with Annette from which pleasuredue alone to two such heartsmay I ever be excluded if I cease to be worthy its contemplation'  To this succeeded a conversation consisting en∣tirely of remarks The whole of Standfast's con∣duct was taken piece meal and commented on as far as it was consistent with Figgins's compact with Emma and Charles plainly saw that but for that vi∣per both his father and mother might have been alive in all probability at that moment  As to Figgins himself Charles did not choose to  let his opinion of him take date earlier than his reformation since which he was charmed with every action  CHAPTER VI  WHICH WILL BOTH PLEASE AND AFFECT THE READER  Sir Sidney and his family were by this time in Warwickshire Nothing however hard as his in∣clination spurred him could induce Charles to pay his respects to the baronet before he discharged his debts in London He panted to find himself once more a free man in his own country Sending Mrs Marlow therefore before him whose presence was particularly wishedfor more than one rea∣sonby Emma our hero and Figgins visited all the quondam proprietors of the impartial news∣paper and paid off their demands nor did they beget a little consternation among them by saying that the cause was now taken up in so spirited a manner that a public print would shortly come out which must be the inevitable destruction of all the rest for it would expose their partiality their bribes their connections together with all the names of those who were their supporters and abet∣tors and in short their whole arcana from such  authority as the whole world would know in a mo∣ment to be authentic  So far did they carry this that hand bills were immediately dispersed holding out in such feasi∣ble terms a plan for the destruction of these diurnal locusts that private terms of conciliation came to them from two or three of the most vulnerable which they to foment the matter still more pub∣lished in a second hand bill  At length having enjoyed a complete laugh at them and been joined by the town they went into the country and left them sweating with sus∣pense  The meeting between Charles and Sir Sidney was truly affecting The noble candour of the ba∣ronet the manly honesty of his selfaccusation had in it a dignity of soul highly admirable He thought nothing a condescension which could serve to assure his young friend how deeply he felt the recollection of his former slights and suspicions nor did he spare either his penetration or his justice for hav∣ing admitted them for a single moment to take place in his mind  He declared he had ever held it as a maxim that  the most glorious moment of a man's life was that in which he acknowledged and repented of an error and so heartily was he at that instant ashamed of his conduct in relation to Charles that he should never have forgiven himself if it had not convinced him at the same time of his valuable friend's unparalleled virtue that it was the very fire out of which that virtue came pure from the trial  Charles who endeavoured in vain to prevent this declaration had nothing for it but to palliate the blame Sir Sidney had so handsomely thrown on himself He said under such delusive influence it was impossible but he must have fallen in with the opinion of others for that the very goodness of his heart would naturally incline him to credit so many well confirmed circumstances It was the business of those who had attempted his downfal to stick at nothing They had their private motives of which it was impossible he should see the extent nay as their villanies involved so many important circumstances a nice investigation of which was necessary to effect their detection it was extremely difficult as well as dangerous for a friend though ever so zealous to offer any thing in his defence while on his side conscious of the integrity of his  own motives Sir Sidney must ultimately have con∣demned him as deficient in every delicate feeling if he appeared forward to deprecate anger which he had neither provoked nor merited  He said much more to this purpose and con∣cluded with entreating Sir Sidney to believe that could he have satisfied his own susceptibility there was no moment during the whole time he had the misfortune to labour under his ill opinion that he would not have gone any length to have effected a reconciliation That reconciliation was now he thanked God complete without any conduct de∣rogatory to the honour of either and it should be the business of his life to preserve so valuable a friendship uninterrupted  Lady Roebuck received Charles as the son of her deceased friend She found him just what she wished but not more than she expected She thanked heaven that so perfect a good understanding had happily taken place and declared except a tinge of unhappiness at the situation of Annette she had not now another wish to gratify  Emma did no more than receive her king and render him her allegiance She told him he was  welcome welcome as the rain to MARCUS AU∣RELIUS though like that he came a little of the latest but that it was not a time to talk for like that general she had mentioned  "now they were refreshed they had yet a battle to gain"  A consultation on the measures necessary to be taken was now proposed previous to which how∣ever Charles warmly entreated to see Annette with whose melancholy situation Figgins and Mrs Mar∣low had gradually acquainted him He was told the sight of her would greatly shock him that she knew nobody that she was continually buried in profound meditation and yet there was a distinc∣tion in her manner of noticing those who were near her if it could be called noticing them for she testified less melancholy when Emma was present than any other person except Mrs Marlow upon whom she would sometimes look and sigh  'Oh God' said Charles and shall such angelic sweetness be lost to the world Does she never speak'  'Never' said Lady Roebuck 'any thing but one remarkable sentence which we will not an∣ticipate you shall hear it from herself'  Charles's curiosity was now whetted to its keenest edge and he most servently entreated he might immediately see her  Emma undertook to enquire if it was a proper time and returned with information that she was then lying asleep with her head on Mrs Marlow's lap Charles begged he might see her in that situ∣ation which would take off in some degree the shock of his first interview and afterwards leaving her undisturbed he should be more calm and better prepared to bear a second  This being agreed to they all repaired to a draw∣ing room where the beautiful insensible lay on a sofa reclined in sleep in the exact situation that Emma had described  Charles devoured her lovely form with his eyes It was the Annette he had seen covered with inno∣cent confusion at Aix la Chapelle it was she who tore his heart with apparently unjust anger the night before he left England it was she he had seen in so many delusive dreams she for whom he had vented so many unavailing sighs she his soul adored she for whom alone he wished to live she whom he was doomedthough now foundto lose for ever  These were the glowing ideas which our hero felt but dared not utter It was Annette he be∣held and yet her pallid cheekwhich spoke at once her distress and resignationforced from him first a starting tear then a profound sigh and after∣wards in spight of all his efforts an exclamation of  'Oh heavenly God do I live to see this'  At these words Annette started from her sleep looked wildly round her then upon the ground then sighed then played with her hair then starting from the sofa walked towards the window re∣placed herself on the sofa sighed again and then significantly moving her head she exclaimed  'Oh noI am sure my poor Charles is not a villain'  'And is this the sentence I was to hear' cried Charles 'And can my Annette think of me In madness think of me Kindly think of me I cannot bear it No my life' cried he throwing himself at her feet 'your Charles is not a villain he loves you tenderly dearly loves you and would give his life to purchase for you a single glimpse of returning reason Look on me my Annette Speak to me She will not'  'My dear Mr Hazard you have greatly agi∣tated her' said Lady Roebuck 'Heaven send  it may be a fortunate symptom At present I think we had better leave her Mrs Marlow will give us an account of the effect this interview has on her spirits'  CHAPTER VII  LAUDABLE DUPLICITY AND A MAD SCENE  WHILE these matters were carrying on at Sir Sidney's Gloss was occupied or at least appeared to be so in discharging his public duty and giving ministerial dinners Nor did this great man dream while he feasted upon muffins and paragraphs for breakfast in London that a stroke was meditating in Warwickshire which all his influence backed with all his cunning would be found ultimately insufficient to parry  He knew of Charles's marriage and therefore was not at all surprised either that he should return and discharge his debtsfor no man had it more clearly in his power than Mr Gloss to ascertain that Charles was a man of strict honouror that he should threaten to take vengeance on the venal herd of diurnal scribblers for he also well knew that our hero was both capable of planning such a casti∣gation and resolute enough to inflict it  To say the truth the necessity he should lie under as he conceived of learning our hero's measures and being active in circumventing them together with the pains he took to quiet those who feared they should smart under the lash that seemed to be preparing for them and which their own fears mag∣nified into something worse than that they richly merited at the cart's tail induced Mr Gloss to overstay his appointment with Sir Sidney who by the advice of Emmawithout whose concurrence nothing of moment was now undertakenwrote him a letter and gently upbraided him for neglect∣ing his private concerns though at the same time it was impossible the letter said too much to ad∣mire that public virtue which was the cause of it  'Stupid dotard' said Gloss to himself as he read the letter 'I have infatuated the old block∣head'  What however would he have said had he known that in return for the treachery by which he had influenced Sir Sidney to write that unjust letter to Charles when in France Charles himself stood at the elbow of Sir Sidney and approved of the ho∣nest duplicity contained in the letter now written as a snare to detect his villany  In order to this detection and indeed to the de∣tection of a great deal more as it was necessary to  tread on very tender ground the confederacy agreed that Charles and Figgins should take up their resi∣dence at a distance from Sir Sidney's that Emma should appear gradually to waver in her sentiments on the representation of Mrs Marlow who was to tell a long story of having left him in consequence of improper conduct to her daughter This in particular was hit upon as it would be taking the very tone Gloss had himself often sounded  These resolutions and a letter received from Mr Gloss informing Sir Sidney that he would wave all considerations of engagements with ministers offices councils and levees to attend the more welcome duties of love and friendship induced the two friends to be expeditious in taking their departure previous to which however Charles earnestly so∣licited one more interview with Annette  She had manifested uncommon inquietude ever since she had been so agitated at the sight of Charles nor could all their endeavours though she conti∣nued perturbed and restless induce her to utter a syllable unless he was shewn to her at a distance which he had been three or four times by the ad∣vice of the physicians Upon one of these occa∣sions she cried  'It is false that's not Gloss'  and  upon another she uttered in a scream  'Hide your∣self hide yourself in France they'll put you in prison'  At length they kept him from her and then she began to be inquisitive concerning him In one of these moods he appeared before her and for a short interval while she ceased her loquacity and was lost in profound meditation he looked on her with inexpressible tenderness heaving an agonizing sigh and sheding a burning tear The sigh at∣tracted her attention and as she vacantly regarded him she cried  'Who are you If you were not lovely like my Charles I should call you Gloss He sighs he sheds tears but his sighs carry the contagion of a pest and his tears are the tears of a crocodile Sir I have the best father in the world He married me to one villain to protect me as he said from another Is the vulture a kinder friend to the lamb than the eagle But see how people may be deceived It was only a deceitful mirror a false medium for sir ca∣lumny is not content with wounding but poison must follow the bite But why wound mePity that excessive tenderness should inflict misery I must never smile again else I could laugh out to think that the best wisdom will sometimes sink  to the worst folly for Sir Sidney Roebuck is my father I have two mothers yet no mother at all They are both angels one of them in hea∣ven as some think and the otherOh No man but my father could deserve two angels He is an angel himself I was right then to marry Gloss I was right to obey my father I will sa∣crifice my life for him but I won't sacrifice my un∣derstanding for any body Sir unhand me there is not a word of truth in all you say You soar above him Grovel lay prostrate like your soul in villanous filth You traduce him Did all the fiends your fellows surround me did a thousand deaths await me were I obliged to give you my hand in marriage I would abash you I would strike you to the soul I would chill you with horror and saythat my poor Charles is not a villain'  Here she was seized with strong convul∣sions and then put to bed after which re∣course was immediately had to medical assist∣ance  The next day she became more composed and at intervals had some dawn of reasonCharles however was carefully kept from her es∣pecially  as she appeared in imminent danger which circumstance also out of tenderness was carefully kept from him  CHAPTER VIII  PROVES THAT THE LANDLORD'S OBSERVATION AT THE JOHN OF GAUNT'S HEADTHAT HUMAN CREATURES ARE LIKE BUCKETS IN A WELLWAS WELL FOUNDED  As there are a prodigious number of circum∣stances which I must now clearly and therefore gradually develope I shall regularly bring for∣ward such characters as may be useful to me in the prosecution of this task and first Mr Balance whom I certainly did not intend to celebrate as an honest lawyer upon the credit of one or two upright actions for I must have been a novice indeed had I not known that the evidence ought to be very strong and convincing that could substantiate so un∣common a fact  Let it be known that Mr Balance began to en∣tertain a tolerable good opinion of Charles earlier than many others of his friends and it arose from this circumstance When he received an order to grant Figgins that annuity of a hundred pounds  formerly spoken of our hero was certainly in the worst disgrace with him and this matter remaining unexplained for a considerable time nobody was forwarder than Mr Balance to blame his conduct in the presence of Sir Sidney nay I question whe∣ther Mr Gloss himself did him as far as it went more injury in the opinion of the baronet for even Emma could not consider him as interested in his affairs but as it is the nature of goodness to enu∣merate the errors of others with reluctance so it is to feel the warmest anxiety to atone for its own  So it happened with Mr Balance When Fig∣gins called upon him not more to receive his three hundred and fifty pounds which were due to him and which we have seen him so handsomely refuse to appropriate to his own use than to solicit his hearty concurrence in Emma's measures he was so charmed with Figgins's selfcondemnation and the brilliant character he gave of his friend that he very naturally askedand indeed the reader will ask toowhy he had not come to him sooner  It has been seen however that what Figgins and Emma were agitating was of two great a magni∣tude to be slightly touched on but a circumstance happening just at that time which gave them  reason to believe that Mr Balance would not only be a very useful but a very willing assistantfor I have said that his foible though an attorney was to detect rascalityFiggins paid him a visit and after an hour's conversation that gentleman inlisted under Emma's banners  Had not our hero decamped to France in that precipitate manner a few days from that period might have made him happy in the possession of Annette to achieve which enterprize Figgins as we have seen called at his house The necessary steps however to bring about that desirable event if it should ever take place requiring his presence they were obliged to be deferred He is now upon the spot and I beg the reader's attention while I trace out those steps one by one  Scarcely had Charles and Figgins situated them∣selves in their new residence when Mr Balance called on them with whomin company with some necessary persons employed on the occasionthey proceeded to Hazard house and knocked very peremptorily at the door  Finding the Lady Dowager alone Mr Balance told her that he came vested with authority to re∣store the rightful Lord Hazard to his title and es∣tate  which information the lady affected at first not to understand and afterwards to treat with great contempt but being told that Mr Tadpole was in custody and had made an ample confession she seemed greatly shocked Catching however at every straw she endeavoured still to stem that tor∣rent which seemed ready to engulph her nor would acknowledge any thing till at length being told that the sum of Mr Tadpole's confession was that he had been legally married to her ten years that consequently her subsequent marriage with Lord Hazard was illegal her children illegitimate and of course that no bar stood between Charles and the possession of his title and fortune she acted a part something in the same style in which we were sometime ago so amused with the vagaries of Mrs O'Shocknesy  Now the fact was that Mr Tadpole was not in custody nor had he made any confession He was only kept out of the way by one of Kiddy's cute manoovres as he called it who to be plain hav∣ing been sometime an accessary and at length a principal in Emma's plots suggested the pro∣perest mode of carrying this one into effect for said Kiddy  'if we attack the rum squire he will be peery and prevaricative but if we whiddle a little to ma'am though she is as fly as Satan  guilt will fly in her face the pearls will trickle and we shall have her as snug as be damnedLord forgive me for uttering such a word'  Mr Tadpole as had been concerted in due time made his appearance He bounced and flew about but being convinced by incontrovertible documents that he was completely discovered be∣came at length tame and threw himself on our hero's mercy who put a finish to the business by assigning Mr Tadpole and his lady for the pre∣sent that residence he had taken for Figgins and himself and assuring them that though he should enter into a severe scrutiny of all their conduct re∣lative to the management of the estate since it had been in their hands yet on account of his bro∣ther's children the justice he should be obliged to use should be tempered with as much mercy as the nature of such a case would admit  Here let me for the sake of truth relate a most extraordinary trait of superior female cunning I have said that Mrs Tadpolefor we shall call her so in futurehad her doubts as to who slept with her at Lisle but that those doubts had subsided and that at length she had fully believed it could be no other than Charles Can it be credited that she was inspired with hope from the recollection of  this circumstance and that she flattered herself should she take a favourable opportunity of repre∣senting it privately a repetition of the crime might give her a power over him What a pity that Figgins who thought as Kiddy has it ploughing with the heifer might work out something for the general good should undeceive her which he did and so render all her schemes abortive  The documents which were explained to Mr Tadpole I shall now explain to the reader It will be remembered that Kiddy on his return to England called on Mr Standfast with an inten∣tion of giving up Mr Tadpole but that he sud∣denly altered his resolution attached himself to that gentleman and gave up his benefactor Kiddy knew of the marriage of Mr and Mrs Tadpole and it must have been something of a very particu∣lar nature indeed predetermined as he was to dis∣close it that could prevent him from doing soThe fact however is as I have related it and it was not till the nice train of circumstances con∣ducted by Emma carried into effect by Swash and his daughter and at length supported by Figgins had properly worked upon him that he wavered in his attachment but even when he had done so nothing could be adduced against Tadpole but Kiddy's ipse dixit which was grounded upon a  confession of the gentleman and lady during a squabble when they were in France and when they thought Kiddy out of earshot  Without collateral evidence therefore nothing could be done This Kiddy contrived to procure and it was not long before he suspected that he should get at it through a gentleman who in a very importunate way would sometimes call on Mr Tadpole for some hints that constantly passed be∣tween that worthy wight and his lady after he was gone convinced Flush that he knew something of their private affairs  One day as this gentleman was descending the staircase after a long and pretty loud conversation with Tadpole the latter followed him saying  'You may make yourself very easy for I will send to you on Wednesday by the post'  This was heard by Kiddy from the butler's pan∣try into which pantry on the following Wednes∣day he coaxed the footman who was entrusted with the letter and after giving him as he called it his dose he contrived to get the letter from him under a pretext of looking at the direction and then exchanged it for another which he had  previously written and which the poor footman who as Kiddy knew could not read carried to the postoffice  Kiddy's letter was as follows  TO THE REVEREND Mr FIGGINS  WE begin to be down upon them the Lord be praised I shall tell you all how and about it tomorrow Blow me Mr Figgins if I don't think this repentance will be the saving of my precious soul  Thy brother sinner K FLUSH  As soon as Flush was alone he broke open the other letter the cover of which was directed "To Mr Skinks" and described his residence in London It contained these words  SKINKS  I have considered the matter and really think you are too peremptory What I have pro∣mised is very handsome and I will not consent to a tittle more If you think it will better suit  your purpose to turn about do so with all my heart If you know my secrets recollect that yours are also known to eitherat your own op∣tionyour firm friend or determined enemy  TIMOTHY TADPOLE  This letter by the advice of Emma was imme∣diately conveyed to Figgins who upon consulting with Mr Balance and putting different circum∣stances together began to have a strong suspicion that he himself had lent a helping hand in the busi∣ness of Mr Tadpole's marriage  Tadpole as the reader knows was an attorney's clerk Be it now known that Skinks was an attor∣ney's clerk also but having been guilty since the expiration of his article of many nefareous practices in the way of his profession he became among many other rogues of the same description well known to Mr Balance who happening just at that time to have him under his thumb told Figgins that he had no doubt but he should bring him to reason  Figgins consented to use Mr Balance's authority as a  corps de reserve  but thought it a good thing previously to worm a confession out of Shinks him∣self  For this purpose he called on him and pre∣tended that he was commissioned by Tadpole to settle once for all their dispute  As Figgins familiarly mentioned the business of the marriage and ventured a few guesses at circum∣stances which might probably belong to it the other entered into the business candidly enough till at length Figgins's suspicions were confirmed and he was enabled to speak to it from his own knowledge for he found it to be this  When he was a bridewell boy he was applied to by a gentleman to carry him and another up the river in one of those barges which it is well known the bridewell boys are very expert at rowing  This expedition was to Wandsworth It was conducted in the night and Figgins and another who were let into the secret understood that it was set on foot for the purpose of stealing a young lady from a boarding school and that the friend of the gentleman who hired the barge was to be married to her  Being at that time anxious to get at as much of this secret as possibleprobably from as honest a reason as that which now impelled the conduct of  Mr Skinks he took the proper methods which he could do as cunningly as any body to trace the conduct of the parties and soon found where the marriage rites were performed  This however accomplished and concealment being no longer necessary Figgins profited in no way at that time by the intelligence he had been so solicitous to procure It being now however singularly serviceable to his friend he rejoiced that it had struck him to use it  The reader is now ready to ask why Mr Figgins did not recollect all these circumstances at Lisle To which I answer that Tadpole's real name was Poach which when he first conceived that very honest intention of marrying his wife to Zekiel he warily changed that he might be the less liable to a detection and as to their persons he did not see either of them at the time of the elopement but very imperfectly having never been in their com∣pany but between the hours of eleven o'clock at night and five in the morning  Skinks however who managed every thing he recollected perfectly well both as to his name and his person and the whole business would long be∣fore  have occured to him but for the change of Poach into Tadpole  Pretending to leave the negociation open be∣tween Skinks and Tadpole he hastened to Mr Ba∣lance who first imposing the most profound si∣lence upon Skinks under pain of inflicting that punishment he knew he had incurred procured all those documents the sight of which as I have said so completely silenced Tadpole consisting of a cer∣tificate of the marriage an avowal of every thing under Skinks's handwhich he readily gave upon reading Tadpole's letterand a few other necessary matters  Thus having made my hero a lord and given him a noble estate I shall proceed to see whether he stands a chance of ever possessing that content without which in the opinion of many grandeur and riches are only a substitute for happiness  CHAPTER IX  A GOOD DEAL OF BUSTLE A HEROIC MOTHER AND TWO OR THREE NOTABLE DISCOVERIES  As I flatter myself the reader will give me credit for a complete knowledge of the power and effect of contrast it will not be thought impolitic in me to bring forward our old friend Standfast in oppo∣sition to Mr Balance But exclusive of this arti∣ficial way of introducing him I have now a very natural one for as this history is drawing apace towards its conclusion it certainly could not have been complete had I neglected to record in the fullest manner what became of a character who had filled in it so distinguished a situation  Mr Standfast and his lovely partner since their mortifying disappointment on Zekiel's accession to his fortune had figured away with various success At one time they were rolling in splendour at an∣other frightened at bailiffs till having been con∣cerned  in pharaoh banks E O tables lottery offi∣ces and every species of gambling either brilliant or contemptible according as their circumstances varied they were at length reduced to the most mortifying poverty  Just at that time the change of the ministry as I have already recorded placed Glosswho be it known had never turned tall on his old friendsin a responsible situation under government They now resolved that Mr Standfast should become a contractor by which means they very soon reesta∣blished themselves in tolerable opulence and here a very striking reflection presents itself that just as the pupil Charles was compelled by the loss of his fortune to quit the worthy employment of dis∣pensing benefits and relieving the necessities of the poor and oppressed the tutor Standfast should make a fortune by administering to folly and wick∣edness and oppressing and grinding the unfortunate and necessitous  In this situation had they for some time conti∣nued when Charles's sudden advancement to a coronet gave them to fear that something was  "rot∣ten in the state of Denmark"  What however they could not devise Sir Sidney had certainly  taken careful measures to appear perfectly indiffer∣ent as to what concerned Charles but yet it was a moot point with Gloss whether he was a friend or an enemy for as Annette was carefully kept from him and Emma in spight of all her caution could not help occasionally a little exultation his artsespecially as it was necessary to lay them on thicker than ever and as every body knew them to be so many barefaced falsiticswere so apparent that it really became an irksome task to have him about the baronet's family although they were under the necessity of doing so till they should be able to ac∣complish their  coup de grace  About this time he received a letter from Stand∣fast which informed him that the ministry were again tottering He therefore hastened to town and finding that the intelligence was but too true a scheme was concerted between these amiable friends to embezzle certain monies which they well knew where to lay their hands on and decamp into a foreign country  This however could not be effected without the previous concurrence of certain men called clerks in whose possession were books and tallies and other documents by means of which alone they could obtain a right to receive these said monies  These documents they hoped to procure through the influence of our old friend Viney who had held a lucrative situation under Gloss ever since he first came into office but a younger clerk who happened to be a youth of honour and spirit and who had very nearly been put out of office because he had threatened to chastise this old sinner for most scan∣dalous conduct to his sister a beautiful girl of thir∣teen conjectured by circumstances what was going forward  In short in attempting to possess himself of the necessary papers Viney plainly found by the steps that had been taken to prevent his intentions that he was discovered and therefore lest he should be involved in the guilt went directly and gave in∣formation against his two friends who holding his conduct in equal distrust got intelligence of his treachery in time as they imagined to ward off its consequences  Neither Standfast nor Gloss had been idle for though they could not accomplish their grand point they nevertheless got together a pretty round sum which was at that moment deposited in Standfast's bureau and as a  coup de maitre  it was agreed that Gloss should force Annette from her father with  an idea that after possession by means of marriage or any other means Sir Sidney would not only be glad enough to make peace with them but give his daughter a fortune These were his words when he proposed the matter to Standfast  'As to the boy Charles he can never marry her but this is no time for investigation As to Sir Sidney he will be glad enough to come to terms when the injury is in any other way irreparable If not she is the only woman I ever loved and if possession should cloy that love she is very beau∣tiful and will always fetch a good price'  I do not know that I have ever before made Mr Gloss speak without disguise and I almost hope even now that the reader will disbelieve that such a man could ever impose upon Sir Sidney But nothing can be clearer than that such conduct is not only in nature but that it is practised every day and practised successfully Goodness neither knows nor suspects the snares of villany which covers itself in a veil so truly the hue of virtue and which in this instance wore so completely that appearance to the eyes of Sir Sidney that till he saw in his last visit the soul of Gloss in its own filthy colours so free was he from a practical know∣ledge of what qualities vice was formed he did not  believe so vile a human monster could infest the face of the earth  The poor fond infatuated Standfast on his part was also determined not to leave his partner behind him and therefore having previously agreed with Gloss on a meeting place hastened home that like an obedient wife she might pack up her alls and accompany him  Reader I do not think I have given thee a more sensible pleasure throughout this work than thou wilt now receive when I inform thee that he found his house in confusion his bureau broken open and stript of every thing and the dear partner of his soul decamped with his kind friend Dogbolt  Were I perfect in the duty of a historian I ought here to describe that hell his mind but as no reader will be so unreasonable as to expect a de∣scription of what no words can express I shall con∣tent myself with saying that no reprobate ever swore more volubly no dancingmaster ever capered more curiously no bedlamite ever raved more in∣coherently In the midst of this paroxism he felt himself suddenly held down by two men who thinking probably that a strait waistcoat was not strong enough to hold so violent a maniac put him  on a pair of handcuffs and with the assistance of several others carried him away in a hackney coach  Mr Gloss on his part made the best of his way into Warwickshire determined to carry off Annette let what would be the consequence He knew he must act very craftily and therefore took care pro∣perly to instruct his emissaries by one of whomindeed the very same gentleman who accompanied Annette to town in the chaisehe received intelli∣gence that the young lady was much better and now rode out every morning for an airing either with Lady Roebuck Emma or Mrs Marlow  When last Mr Gloss had been in Warwickshire he had taken uncommon pains to insinuate himself into the good graces of this old lady who also ap∣peared to pay him extraordinary attention to say truth an attention that rather bordered upon in∣quisitiveness and which he would have repulsed if it had not struck him that it might lead to the ac∣complishment of this scheme which as his  dernier resort  he always had meditated  He had now no doubts could he get Annette at a distance from home through the connivance of Mrs Marlow but he should complete his design  He thought he had discovered that the old lady's passion was avarice for he knew that the whole story of her having quitted Charles on account of her daughter was trumped up nay he had told her so and had got from her a reluctant confession that her inducement to take that step was a wish to shelter herself comfortably for the remainder of her life at a distance from a turbulent young man who though he had good qualities would never do any good either for himself or any one else  Possessed as he imagined of so much of Mrs Marlow's private sentiments he thought he might without danger tamper with her a little further and for that purpose sent a servant on horseback to say generally at Roebuck hall that Mr Gloss proposed to pay that place a visit in the course of a few days to which effect he also wrote a note to Sir Sidney but informed Mrs Marlow privately by another note that he had some most particular business with her which he must explain that even∣ing and would attend her wherever she should ap∣point He took care however so to qualify that note by introducing such circumstances relative to her that it must have told against her had she either partially or generally shewn it to any one  Mrs Marlow made a great many difficulties but  at length consented to meet him at the bottom of the garden which in fact she did He lamented his situation said he plainly saw that Sir Sidney would go with the stream that she had herself al∣lowed in former conversations that he was avari∣cious and therefore she must see the temptation a coronet held out would not be resisted that if he could be favoured with an interview with Miss Roe∣buck without her father's knowledge he was sure he could lay such convincing proofs before her of the propriety of his conduct and the impossibility even now that she could honourably become the wife of that young upstart as he had no doubt would conquer all scruples  He promised Mrs Marlow mountains if he suc∣ceeded and at length it was agreed that he should come upon them as if by accident the following Thursday at an appointed spot before which time Mrs Marlow told him there would be no oppor∣tunity as Lady Roebuck would till then accom∣pany her daughter and on that morning she would have a particular engagement at home  Those readers who are sorry to see this apparent desertior of principles in Mrs Marlow will be more so when they are told that on the following Thursday when she was to ride out with Annette  in order to keep the coast as clear as possible that Mr Gloss might put his design in executionfor not to disguise the truth he had at a second inter∣view informed her of the wholethe moment Gloss appeared at a distance she sent the footman for some purpose or other back again so that there was no one to oppose what was agitating but an old and almost helpless coachman  This being the signal agreed upon Gloss sprang forward and seeing some horsemen on a hill before him which he took for his myrmidons he soon came up to the side of the coach Mrs Marlow pretended great surprise at seeing him and after some general conversation asked if he would not walk in This he eagerly consented to and the coachman got down apparently to open the door  Hearing horses and seeing men in great coats he now expected to find the coachman seized as had been agreed on and the coach box mounted by different men to whom he had given such in∣structions What then must have been his asto∣nishment when he himself was seized and told there was a warrant against him for murder  'Who dares accuse me' said Gloss very pe∣remptorily  'I dare' said Emma who personated  Annette  'And I' said Mrs Marlow 'who pre∣pared the snare that brought you into the hands of justice You are my son and I cut you off to cure my honour as I would amputate an infected limb to preserve my life'  CHAPTER X  A LITTLE RETROSPECTION AN EXAMINATION SOME HORROR AND A MOST MORTIFYING DISAPPOINTMENT  THE reader having seen that Mrs Marlow in∣stead of acting the treacherous part of a faithless servant had assumed all the dignity of a Spartan mother it may not be amiss for the satisfaction of my readers to see how she became that mother  It will easily be recollected that in the second volume of this history I gave a hint that Emma had made a very singular discovery on hearing the particulars of Mrs Marlow's story This disco∣very was no less than that Standfast was the very clergyman by whom that poor lady had been se∣duced through the connivance of her aunt when little more than an infant  She recollected to have heard that there had been a similar accusation against him when first he lived chaplain to Major Malplaquet and now having  learnt the maiden name of Mrs Marlow she found that she must have been the innocent victim whom she had always understood he had treated with un∣common cruelty For the remainder of her intel∣ligence she received it first from Figgins and af∣terwards through Swash from Flush who had lived with him at the time and was in the plot but as her communication with Kiddy had been ambiguous and guarded till some little time before the grand eclaircissement she had only learnt that Gloss was the precious fruit of that illicit amour in time to make it the climax of her discovery to Sir Sidney  The reader recollectswhich will illustrate this matter betterthat while that close intimacy sub∣sisted between Charles and Gloss Figgins was of the party who from some circumstances that came within his knowledge learnt that Gloss did not go to the Cape of Good Hope This induced him to think oddly of his connexion with Mr Standfast but he did not find it worth his while to investigate it till Emma went to France at which time he un∣dertook to gather all the intelligence he could for her at home that had it been necessary to make her grand discovery there she might be in possession of facts of magnitude sufficient to have induced Sir Sidney to discard Gloss Thus she learnt by a  letter from Mr Figgins three days before the busi∣ness of Aix la Chapelle that Gloss was the son of Standfast but she never divined the rest as I have just said till after repeated conversations with Mrs Marlow and Kiddy's confirmation of those suspi∣cions that arose out of it  Thus in different stages of this business she used as much of this fact as she thought necessary for her purpose She told Annette in France she could blast Mr Gloss's hopes whenever she pleased she told Mr Gloss before Sir Sidney it would be seen WHO he was she imparted the secret to Mrs Marlow and finally through the proper and heroic feeling of that good woman she now held him her captive and was determined to give him up to that justice he had so studiously laboured to abuse  This connexion of father and son will naturally account for the blended interest of Standfast and Gloss and also for the congeniality of their senti∣ments nay it will take off an imputation from me for as I may be almost accused of representing na∣ture in too odious a light by bringing forward two characters so shockingly profligate so the proba∣bility of their being so is considerably strengthened when it is found that the same blood ran in the veins of both nay such pains had been mutually  taken that the emulation of the son might be worthy the instruction of the sirefor vipers and doves are equally fond of their offspringthat it is not asto∣nishing Mrs Marlow should be so shocked with Gloss at the time Charles was arrested or express that detestation which was inspired by the remark∣able resemblance of both his person and manner to those of Standfast  But says the reader did it never occur to Mrs Marlow that this very same Standfast was her be∣trayer There is great singularity in this circum∣stance Mrs Marlow did not know Charles till he was nearly ruined and it cannot be forgotten that Standfast giving up his situation as an actor in this play of human life had retired and become a prompter long before that period Therefore not seeing him on the stage she did not know that there was any such person employed in the theatre Charles never detailed his affairs and though she knew the sum of them she was ignorant of many of the particulars till she began to converse with Emma who after all was extremely cautious of letting her into so much of them as might impede any of her measures Therefore it was not till after Charles went to France the second time and she had had frequent conversations with Emma and Figgins that she came at this truth which at  that time Emma was the more anxious to investi∣gate finding it would be a matter of infinite im∣port to ascertain that Mr Gloss was the son of Mrs Marlow by Standfast And on the other hand that I may make this matter perfectly clear as Standfast went to Flanders before the good lady in question was married he never knew her by the name of Marlow I could have strengthened this elucidation by noticing that Standfast like Atall in the play had a different name at that time for every different intrigue but as Mrs Marlow knew him by his real name I did not chuse so to violate my historic veracity as to make out a case by the insertion of a falsity  It now becomes necessary to illustrate two or three points that I may give a clear stage to some prin∣cipal actors who are presently to make their ap∣pearance  I have said in its place and since hinted that Kiddy had been very much shocked at some propo∣sal or other made him by Standfast so shocked in∣deed that it wrought in him an entire reformation and attached him to the interest of his patron's de∣clared enemy I have also said that when Figgins went to expostulate with Standfast he in the course of that expostulation became witness to such a  scene of altercation between that gentleman and Mrs O'Shocknesy as begat some suspicions in his mind of a very horrid nature  I have all along represented Kiddy as a very weak but not a very wicked character He had from his low origin his mean education his grovling propensities been taught to consider Mr Flush as a superior genius or as he called it geno and thus he firmly believed that the consummation of all human perfection was the accomplishment of a welldigested fraud but Kiddy always took care as he phrased it to draw the line lest as he cun∣ningly observed the line should draw him  Thus were your wife or daughter to be seduced your purse stolen your reputation destroyed by treachery and cunning Kiddy would lend a help∣ing hand with all the veins in his hearthis lan∣guage againbut as to going upon the highway or being guilty of any other dishonest act which the law denominates felony in that case no crown lawyer ever knew better how to discriminate than Kiddy And this the reader when he recollects his outset in life will see he was taught by that first of masters experience  In short seeing men of the first fortunes and abili∣ties  constantly employing them to impose upon their friends and neighbours he only looked upon it as selfdefence to arm himself with the same arts for said Kiddy  'In this here world I can't for my part see why a man has not a right to be as bad as his betters'  Having therefore such an aversion to a halter no wonder that Kiddy should be so affronted at a direct proposal from Standfast to commit an act for which had it been discovered he must have been hanged nor was it an unnatural transition fond as he had been of that fun called human misery to see all of a sudden that he had delighted in it a little too much but as turn which way he would he was in such a situation that he could not help imposing upon somebody he covered his hypocrisy with the veil of religion to rub off slighter sins and those that bore too heavy on his recollection he drowned in a dram for said Kiddy  'though every coge is a nail in my coffin if I do but re∣pent before I am put into it the grim jockies may screw me up and welcome'  To shew however the prevalence of custom upon human nature Kiddy very little considered that in the midst of his repentance he was accessary to a fraud of great magnitude namely the keeping  Charles out of his fortune nor would he in all probability ever have taken any steps to restore him to his right had not this laudable conduct as we have seen been suggested to him by Emma through Swash nor even then had not the mea∣sures to be taken involved in them a positive necessi∣ty of imposing upon Tadpole This last imposi∣tion however being on the side of honour and vir∣tue Kiddy began to feel that however it might be clever to be a rogue it was more comfortable to be an honest man  The repentance of Figgins as the reader knows was better confirmed though as there is weakness in every kind of wickedness so it was certainly as∣sisted by finding in consequence of what dropt from Mrs O'Shocknesy that Standfast had himself perpetrated the very crime which he had vainly persuaded Flush to commit  One moment more and the reader shall know what this crime was and also that it has been very often hinted to him  It will be recollected that Standfast did not ac∣company Mrs O'Shocknesy into Warwickshire probably as he was grown remarkably hipped  owing to his being led by his lady the life of a dog as Jerry Sneak calls it and as he was eternally tortured with his own reflections he might be afraid of ghosts I have said they were driven to the verge of poverty from which nothing could relieve them but the death of Lord Hazard I then say  'what joy to find Lord Hazard no more'  The reader is upon the point of asking  'By what means no more'  Again I compare Standfast to Barnwell who murdered his benefactor which indeed did Standfast or he must have been foully belied for just at the period to which this history is now ar∣rived he was in company with his son Gloss brought before Sir Sidney for that murder  Here it will appear that there was good reason for managing so adroitly the delay from the Mon∣day till the Wednesday of Gloss's pretended inter∣view with Annette It has been said that there is no snare for bringing a man into a scrape like a woman This proved to be the case both as to Standfast and as to Gloss differently however one was betrayed by adhering to a fiend and the other punished for aspiring to an angel  Standfast was taken into custody in town through the vigilance of Mr Balance but Gloss was not to be found therefore when Sir Sidney discovered  that he was in Warwickshire it required the inter∣vention of a few days to procure the warrant that had been granted against him as well as to bring Mr Standfast to that spot where the crime had been committed  Let us now suppose Sir Sidney upon the bench Charles Mr Balance and Figgins by his side and Standfast and Gloss brought before him on a charge of that murder for which we have seen them appre∣hended  Flush deposed what has been related concerning the proposal made him by Standfast Figgins ex∣plained the nature of his suspicions and his conse∣quent conduct and Mr Balance said from the pains he had taken to investigate the business there could be no doubt as far as presumption went but that the prisoners were guilty  'And so presumption is all you have against us' said Gloss  'And this' said Standfast 'upon the evidence of a rascally servant a false friend and a meddling attorney'  Here they became turbulently insolent when the baronet commanding silence and addressing him∣self to Standfast said  'Unhappy man I have a  witness that shall strike terror to thy very soul that presumptuously shameless as thou art shall sicken thee with horror See who enters at that door'  Had Standfast seen a spectre the spectre of Lord Hazard he could not have been more appalled  'By hell it is all over' said he to Gloss 'I thought the rascal had been dispatched'  This witness was John who was tutored as we have seen to refuse the half guinea from Dogbolt who was placed about Charles at the express stipu∣lation of Standfastnot only that his ruin might be more certain but that the conduct of Mr Figgins might be well watched lest as it happened in the case of Kiddy he should not be staunch to the in∣terest of the confederacywho intercepted all the letters who returned expressly to murder his lord who did not seem to arrive however till two days after the murder was committed who then though callous to the core appeared to weep over his mas∣ter's corpse but who had since lived in such a state of agonizing horror and remorse that he now came to make an ample confession  John after displaying a natural and pathetic pic∣ture of his own penitence told a most horrid tale  By large bribes and larger promises he had been prevailed upon to murder his old master For that purpose he stole into the house on the fatal morn∣ing and took away the pistols which were hanging in Lord Hazard's bed chamber He afterwards surprised him in the garden but he declared that when he looked in his poor wronged old master's face which was now grown pale and ghastly ow∣ing he had no doubt to that distress which he him∣self had caused by so often falsely accusing his son all his resolution forsook him and he had not the cruel courage to perpetrate the deed Standfast seeing this rushed from a shrubbery where he had concealed himself lest they should miscarry and as Lord Hazard flew to him for protection and while he was in the attitude of lifting his hands and eyes to heaven that had mercifully sent such a friend to his assistance the unmanly hardened hellish monster cowardly murdered him  To this he added that after the murder was ac∣complished but not till thenfor Standfast was not fully satisfied with his sanguinary exploit till he had convinced himself by a cautious examination that there was no symptom of returning lifethe mur∣derer with great coolness placed the pistol that was discharged close to the body and put that which was yet loaded into the coat pocket which is the  precise situation in which the reader will recollect they were found  John also said that fearing he should be hanged for the part he had taken in this shocking business he did for some time whatever he was bid by Stand∣fast and consented to any wickedness that was pro∣posed to him but his conscience being at last hea∣vily loadedfor which he was often ridiculed and sometimes threatened by Standfasthe was upon the point of giving himself up to justice when it struck him to consult his old friend Flush who he understood had repented and then lived a religi∣ous life  Flush who the reader knows was at that time seeking for every kind of evidence to serve Charles's cause had known John said a great deal of his former wickedness and it was agreed that at a proper time he should be called forward to atone for it by a true confession of all he knew concern∣ing the murder  'That confession' added John 'I have now made and it has taken such a load off my conscience that though all good men must hate me here and I dare not expect mercy here∣after my poor heavy heart will be something lighter when I reflect that I have brought such a  villain to justice to revenge the murder of so good a master'  John's repentance Standfast all along had not only feared but he had determined to guard against its consequences He called him a halfbred vil∣lain one who would certainly one day or other squeak  Impressed with these suspicions he consulted Mrs O'Shocknesy upon the propriety of putting him out of the way She at a proper time to quiet himwhich accounts for his exclamation just now to Glosstold him it had been done by Dogbolt but indeed it was the last thing Dogbolt would have done or she permitted for as that gentleman and lady had for some time determined to get rid of Mr Standfast so it did not appear to be their in∣terest to keep any witness out of the way who should it be necessary might facilitate his being hanged  The evidence being closed Mr Standfast was committed to Warwick jail for the murder of Lord Hazard and Mr Gloss was told there was not sufficient proof against him to criminate him  'Then I demand my liberty' said Gloss very exultingly  'Not quite so fast sir' said Sir Sid∣ney 'You must be remanded to London to an∣swer there a charge of fraud and perjury'  'Of which should I be convicted' said Gloss 'I shall still be happier than your intended son in law The worst that can happen to me is to be sent to a prison from whence for the world wants ta∣lents I shall soon be released after which I shall cut as splendid a figure as the best and drink the pleasurable cup of life by perhaps flattering the foible of some fool who like you may pride him∣self upon virtues attributed to his ancestors which they probably never possessed while his portion shall be bitterness and misery for to be com∣pletely happy he must possess your daughter which he cannot do having already marriedher mother'  CHAPTER XI  VEXATION UPON VEXATION AND SOME PRETTY WRITING TO PROVE THAT CATASTROPHES OUGHT TO BE UNHAPPY  NOT a single returning day had passed since the reconciliation between Charles and Sir Sidney but brought with it some new proof to the latter how egregiously he had been imposed upon by Gloss and what noble firmness there must have been in the mind of our hero who though he panted for an explanation scorned to capitulate for it disho∣nourably  But what were Sir Sidney's feelings when he found that the knave who had thus practised upon his credulity was the son of him who by a long cool deliberate series of unexampled villany had first ruined the peace and then destroyed the life of his friend and benefactor  Oh how he was roused His good sense his friendship his generosity his every seeling seemed  insulted And then the taunting impudence of that insinuation concerning his ancestry which as Sir Sidney indulged it was surely a right and laud∣able pride shewing by what means he had led him into a belief of the most gross and palpable falsity He felt affronted and ashamed and was at a loss to account for the motive that could have induced him to admit such a creature into his conversation He alike reproached himself for having communicated with the viper and thanked providence that had rescued him from its fangs  Yet what was all this compared to that thunder∣bolt which Gloss in his wanton wicked lust of mischief had now hurled at these happy friends The pestiferous breath as it uttered the terrible words affected the hearers like a contagion and it is but too true that he had the insulting trium∣phant unmerciful pleasure to see both Charles and Sir Sidney appalled and confounded  As the reader is of course full of anxious expec∣tation I shall now proceed to a nice investigation of all that train of circumstances which led Mr Gloss to the knowledge of whom our hero had married  The reader will instantly recollect that Sir Sid∣ney  at the latter end of the first book speaks of a lady in the convent that Annette when an infant used to call Mamma Le Clerc It will also easily be remembered that Mr Ingot gave Lord Hazard an account of a Madmoiselle Le Clerc who had some business with Sir Sidney and that this ac∣count tallied so exactly with the story of Annette's mother as to confirm both Lady Hazard and Lady Roebuck in an opinion that it could be no other than her  This Lady as we are informed by Emma left some jewels at Sir Sidney's but she refused at the instance of one of the gentlemen who accompanied her to leave a packet of papers  I will now be honest enough to declare that this gentleman was no other than Combrie and his rea∣son for advising the lady not to leave the papers arose from a sear lest Sir Sidney should actually know who she was and discover what were then her intentions The same reason induced him to prevail on her not to see the baronet in town  The third person who was as I have said de∣puted by the convent to receive the fortune was our old friend Goufre and it was from this journey Combrie became so well acquainted with all his af∣fairs  nay he had attended the young lady with a view to have surprised the vigilance of the procu∣reur and have secured her fortune when in En∣gland which circumstance I also hint in the se∣cond volume but this however not being practi∣cable he had afterwards recourse as we have seen to other methods which were attended with better success  It has been related that on Mrs Hazard's mo∣nument at Rochester were placed her maiden name the name of her first husband and of that she owned when she died This circumstance su∣peradded to some intelligence obtained from one of the firm of Bondham and Coindeed the very gen∣tleman who afterwards went to Botany Baycon∣firmed Mr Gloss's conjectures He had however a great deal of collateral intelligence one of his emissaries having been constantly stationed by the side of our hero who had he attempted to return to England had instructions to lay him by the heels either in Flanders or on his arrival just as might be most expedient to assist the purposes of Mr Gloss Finding however that marriage had barred every passage that could lead to the possession of Annette he at first made himself perfectly easy but when he heard of the death of Mrs Hazard and found that these impediments were removed he was obliged  to cast about in his mind for fresh matter and after straining his ingenuity and putting a variety of circumstances together taking a hint from the name of Le Clerc upon the monument he found out what I have no doubt the reader will be heartily sorry for  It will immediately occur to the reader that both Charles and Figgins must have been acquainted with all this matter and yet it is very certain they were not The history of Annette was known only to five persons namely Lord and Lady Hazard Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck and Emma Three of these did not know the whole truth Thus the name of Le Clerc was never uttered to Charles nor Figgins as the name of Annette's mother nor to Sir Sidney as the maiden name of Mrs Combrie or if it had it probably would not have induced any suspicion of so extraordinary and unlikely a circum∣stance as this for Le Clerc in France is as com∣mon a name as Smith is in England  It also looks singular that Charles should not know the private story of his wife or that she should be ignorant of his but she is mentioned early in life to have been engaged in an intrigue and it is probable that she thought youthful folly was not a proper thing for a husband to be entrusted with  and as to him I have already noticed his remark∣able delicacy towards Annette as well as that she greatly commended him for it Besides had there been no other reason the state of Mrs Hazard's mind and health must have been such as to have precluded the smallest likelihood of retrospective investigation between them on subjects which could only have been developed through the medium of great curiosity and long intimacy neither of which as the reader sees obtained in the present case and therefore nothing could be further from the mind of either than that their union involved in it so momen∣tous and mysterious a circumstance  During the journey that Emma persuaded Sir Sidney to take into France it cannot be forgotten that every possible enquiry was made by the baronet concerning Annette's mother He however only learnt as I there say Ingot's story and also that Miss Le Clerc had shifted her quarters to another convent where they either could not or would not give any account of her The fact was that as the elopement of a nun from a convent in France is never like a runaway from a boarding school in England advertised in all the newspapers but on the contrary kept as snug as possible their enqui∣ries were looked upon as little more than imperti∣nent curiosity which will indeed be readily believed  when it is considered that the convent of our lady of the ascension at Nancywhich was the very place our travellers went tohad been pretty well scandalized by the business of Madame Combrie al∣ready and therefore they were very little likely to gather any intelligence from thence Indeed the matter was so taken in dudgeon that had Sir Sid∣ney stayed any considerable time and repeated his solicitations it is within possibility that he might have been considered as an accessary to the fact of Combrie's procuring the fortune from Goufre and so have been accused of the very fraud which he had been so angry with Charles for committingThus as we have seen he came away from France no wiser than he went there  The reader will now see that as the parties had no sort of communication with each other it was impossible they should compare notes consequently no one of them in such a length of time had en∣tertained the smallest suspicion of what now in one moment appeared to be beyond a doubt  I have two or three times hintedfor I did not chuse to do any morethat Mrs Combrie resembled Annette and there are several passages in this work where the reader would very strongly have scented  this game if I had not opportunely put up some other to divert his attention  The blood hound Gloss however has at length sound it and like all prey started by such sangui∣nary hunters it leads us a tedious chase only to bring us to the knowledge of mischief  To leave every thing but plain narration never was there apparent happiness so dashed by certain disappointment Every comparative circumstance served to confirm the fact and misery seemed now to confound the innocent with the guilty till at length Emma herself after torturing probability by every ingenious and subtle investigation her inven∣tion could supplyall which at an earlier period perhaps I should have given at lengthwas com∣pelled to confess that there was novelty in every thing relative to our lovers for that contrary to all established rules they were born to be virtuous and unhappy  I know not if I have introduced any thing into this history so truly pathetic as what it is now my reluctant duty to mention The health of Annette was only completely confirmed on that very day when the whole family were convinced she could not bless him for whom alone she wished to live and  she was welcomed to reason only to be plunged into misery worse than madness The delight that every one felt at once more beholding the angelic inno∣cence of her soul conveyed by those benevolent smiles which now spoke her thankful joy was dashed with a mixture of agony sighs were mingled with congratulations tears choked the utterance of plea∣sure an universal gloom pervaded those faces that fain would have beamed with the willing smile of grateful transport and every one out of pity ad∣vised a suppression of that wretchedness which no one could conquer  Too plainly did poor Annette perceive the misery that these inexperienced dissemblers vainly en∣deavoured to hide Did she ask if her father was well yes was the answer and a profound sigh fol∣lowed it One began to give her pleasure by an account of the reconciliation of Sir Sidney and Charles and interrupted the relation with a flood of tears From Sir Sidney from Lady Roebuck from Emma from Charles himself she found no better comfort till at length her gentle mind was so wounded and distressed that she seemed like an innocent victim recovered from one torture to be tormented with another still more ingenious  However I may be partial to sportive writing I  really think that in this place it would be both impertinent and unfeeling to tantalize the reader who now begins to think that I have introduced a set of characters which I hold up as models of vir∣tue and goodness only to reward them with un∣merited misery and hopeless wretchedness but I flatter myself I shall not be accused of this unneces∣sary wantonness I do no more than my duty and against all such censure I shall defend myself by noticing that I undertook nothing in this task but to record facts and if I leave the more amiable part of my groupe of characters as miserable as those whose practice has been knavery and villany I shall not even in that case have deserted probability nor have inculcated a useless lesson of morality since to leave goodness in distress is to enforce that highest of moral duties resignation  CHAPTER XII  WHICH CONCLUDES THIS HISTORY  Mr Balance who had been to town for the pur∣pose of seeing that the prosecution against Gloss was properly carried on was also determined to search as deeply as possible into the truth of this unhappy affair and while he was thus employed it happened that he was called upon by a gentle∣man who said he had very particular business with Sir Sidney on this very subject With this gen∣tleman Mr Balance returned to Warwickshire where he told Sir Sidney that from what he could gather he feared the wretched tale was but too true  It will be remembered that Charles knew in the south of France a father Fitzgibbon who told him that in three years from that time he should have some business in England and would then call on him in London Our hero gave him a direction to Mr Balance who he knew would be his man  of business and who whether they were friends or foes would of course forward any thing or person to him  It will also be recollected that Mrs Hazard's mo∣nument at Rochester from which Mr Gloss re∣ceived some of his intelligence was shewn to all strangers It appears therefore feasible enough that Father Fitzgibbon in his way from Dover to the capital should have seen it  Father Fitzgibbon was the person now introduced by Mr Balance who had scarcely exchanged the usual compliments with Charles when he admired by what remarkable and extraordinary means the strangest discoveries are brought about In short it appeared that he was the intimate friend of Com∣brie and had received the greatest obligations from his family that he had known him the whole time he meditated the elopement  with Miss Le Clerc and indeed was the very friend who had equipped him with the dress in which he so successfully per∣sonated father Benedict He had also connived at the business of the keys and lent him much other material assistance which he was the better enabled to do as he was well acquainted with Goufre's af∣fairs and then belonged to a convent at Dieulewar about two leagues from Nancy where all intelli∣gent  travellers to that part of France have been in∣formed there is such a convent made up of English Irish and Scotch and where they brew very good beer  Fitzgibbon mentioned the business of Miss Le Clerc's journey to England and of Combrie's pre∣venting her from leaving the papers at Sir Sidney's adding that those papers had at length been entrust∣ed to him and that as he understood they contained something of consequence he had deferred  'send∣ing them by another' to use his own words 'till he had an opportunity of delivering them him∣self'  So saying he gave the packet to Sir Sidney who in a moment knew and proclaimed that the hand writing was that of Annette's mother  'Then I am right I find' said Fitzgibbon  'Too right' cried one  'Fatal confirmation' sighed another  'Cruel destiny' said a third  'Unheard of misery' exclaimed a fourth  In short the whole company exhibited such tokens of wretchedness that the Irishman cried  'Why by my soul one would tink by all these destinies and fates and long faces that I had brought over the plague sealed up in a letter Upon my  honour and conscience I only discharged the pro∣mise I made poor Mrs Combrie four years ago who desired me moreover to add that every syllable was authentic for in that paper would be found the lady's dying words in her own hand writ∣ing'  It occurring in a moment to every one present that if Mrs Combrie four years ago had given Fitzgibbon the dying words of somebody else writ∣ten in a hand which Sir Sidney knew to be that of Annette's mother Mrs Combrie could not be that mother every countenance immediately under∣went a total change and what had been but the moment before certain misery was now sweet ex∣pectation This was immediately evinced by a volley of opposite exclamations at which Fitzgibbon exclaimed  'Pray good folks is it Bedlam I am in By my soul you seem first to be crazy and after∣wards distracted'  By this time Sir Sidney having ran over a part of what the packet contained found abundantly enough to convince him that there was no farther bar to the happiness of his daughter and our hero To be brief from the papers backed by what Fitz∣gibbon had learnt from Mrs Combrie it appeared that she was certainly the Mamma Le Clerc for∣merly  mentioned for that Annette's mother had left her infant daughter to her care requesting she would contrive to convey her to Sir Sidney which commission through the medium of the nuns of St Claire as we have seen she faithfully executed  The sentiments the distresses the very names of Mrs Combrie and Annette's mother bearing so strong a similarity it is not at all extraordinary that there should be this strict friendship between them or that this assimilation of circumstances should beget a likelihood that they were one and the same person The conduct of the two fathers also is re∣markably similar and it would be extraordinary if it was not They were both bigotted catholics and both punished the disobedience of their daugh∣ters by shutting them up in a convent which is only two instances out of two thousand or very likely ten thousand upon the records of French nunneries where the same crime has been punished in the same manner We have heard that the fa∣ther of Mrs Combrie died in England They now learnt that the father of Annette's mother died in Italy after he had given the whole of his fortune to the church  Fitzgibbon got the laugh completely against the company in the course of investigating all these mat∣ters  He said that after all they were sad bun∣glers at a discovery for added he  'though you have only just found it out by my faith you knew it well enough long ago'  and really if it were not highly indecent to get the laugh against the reader I should be tempted to follow the Irish∣man's example and indulge myself at his expence for it certainly ought to have occurred to him that each of these ladies had a Christian name and if it had he would have know that the Christian name of Sir Sidney's Miss Le Clerc was Annette and that of Combrie's Miss Le Clerc was Araminta  This very circumstance of the difference in the Christian names accounts for the whole and shews how much deeper fear impresses us than hopeAraminta was the name placed upon the tomb and had it been proper to have questioned Gloss as to where he got his intelligence his answer must have developed the whole mystery nay lest it should be penetrated by the reader it may be recollected that I took advantage of the mistake of Charles who absorbed in thought called Mrs Hazard An∣nette by mistake as she lay in her coffin  Thus I have gradually and naturally unravelled all that mass of entangled circumstances that stood between our hero and the possession of his wishes  I shall not offer on my labours a single comment If they embrace any important purpose if they incul∣cate any useful moral or serve occasionally as ob∣jects of warning or imitation in the various pursuits of life I shall have exercised a pleasing duty and shall not fail to receive the thanks of every man of reason and honour as my reward  As Annette was recently recovered from so se∣vere an indisposition and as there were some other very serious matters to settle it was agreed that her union with Charles should be deferred till their ap∣proaching grand feast which was to be celebrated in about a month  I shall take that interval to give a very summary account of what became of the other characters which I have introduced into this work  Standfast actually did what Swash pretended to do He poisoned himself in his cell to prevent his trial The interval between his commitment to jail and his defrauding the hangman exhibited a most frightful example to all villains It consisted of alternate fits of intoxication In some of these he execrated and blasphemed in others he trembled with terror at the horrid images his fancy created  to torture him One hour he howled in an agony of apprehension in another raved in a paroxysm of imprecation till at length his son Gloss affectio∣nate and considerate to the last prevailed on a com∣mon friend to visit him who well tutored for the purpose induced him to save the disgrace that would be entailed on his memory by an ignomini∣ous death and anticipate his fate by poison  Gloss himself had the address to turn this cir∣cumstance to his own account intimating that they had among them made away with his father for fear circumstances not altogether so pleasant should come out on the trial As to his own fate it was this He was put in the pillory where he har∣rangued the populace to such good effect that he persuaded them the constitution of their country was rotten that the grossest abuses were practised by those who were entrusted with the public con∣cerns and so completely did he for the moment work upon the people's credulity that when he returned to prison the horses were taken from the hackney coach in which he rode and the deluded populace with one consent yoked themselves in their place exactly the same as if they were ho∣nourably conducting some patriot who had done an essential service to his country  In process of time he was liberated since when he has lived in various circumstances by depreda∣tions on the public and at this hour goes about like the arch fiend his principal seeking whom he may devour  Mrs O'Shocknesy who had robbed Standfast scarcely arrived on the continent when she was robbed and deserted by Dogbolt After this she herded with a set of contrabanders and at lengthfirst being detected and brandedshe finished her career diseased loathsome and a pauper in the  Hotel de Dieu  As to Tadpole and his wife as they knew that a retrospection would bring out every particular of their nefarious conduct they thought it expedient to meet their examiners half way Charles found the estate rather improved than injured by Tadpole's management and therefore scrupled not to pay such bonds and fulfil such other engagements en∣tered into by his brother as did not strike at the  terra firma  of his ancestors He also agreed to a handsome provision for the children one of whom at this moment is the best horse jockey and the other the best maker of nutcrackers in the king∣dom  Tadpole with this money and what he had pri∣vately amassed launched boldly into his own pro∣fession of attorney to which he added that of money lender and has accumulated an immense fortune by administering to the necessities of young men of fashion under age not scrupling occasionally to lend the person of his  cara sposa  on whom he doats to distraction and who rules him with a rod of Ironto bind an advantageous bargain  The penitent John was put by Kiddy into the hands of a methodist preacher to complete his con∣version but the good man going the wrong way to work by terrifying instead of soothing him his brain was at length touched and he finished his life and his misery together by a rash leap into Swash's millstream  As to the sinner Kiddy as he used to call him∣self he lived for some time pretty comfortably on a handsome annuity that Charles had granted him but having frequented meetings conferences and lovefeasts till his senses were a little deranged he first slanged himself as he called it behind the door and being cut down the shock so preyed upon his spirits that doubling his visits to the brandy bottle he is said literally to have gone out  of the world with a dram in one hand and a homily in the other  At length came the day which was to unite per∣haps the most elegant and accomplished pair that ever graced the altar of Hymen The grand feast was conducted with prodigious splendour which the reader will the more readily conceive when he adds to the former description of this festival the ad∣ditional exertions upon the present happy occasion  Every friend within the knowledge of any of the parties was invited and among the rest Ego Toogood and Musquito who spight of their jar∣ring dispositions united in an universal acknow∣ledgment that wealth worth and happiness were never more emulously blended together  A few words more will still be necessary The good Mildman in a very advanced age yielded his breath amidst the lamentations of his parishio∣ners who sincerely mourned his memory as they accompanied his remains to their last home and whoall they hadas their only remaining tribute to his worth dropt the tear of sensibility on the grave of virtue  Figgins who married the amiable Jude suc∣ceeded  Mildman His reformation is perfect and confirmed and his conduct honourable and exem∣plary Blest with two such friends as Sir Sidney and Charles his happiness is complete His ef∣forts at Castlewick in conjunction with those of Mr Friend at Little Hockley who is still alive though very old have rendered those industrious communities the emulation of each other  Mrs Marlow succeeded Emma as companion to Lady Roebuck Emma herself having at the earnest recommendation of the baronet married the butler now Sir Sidney's land steward She had long be∣fore as I hinted to the reader a sneaking kindness for him on account of his fidelity to his master in France This had improved to use her own words into esteem from her knowledge of him in the fa∣mily and had been confirmed into love by his re∣fusing to take a part against Sir Sidney in her grand plot which however worthy in her would in him have been treachery She has several children who instructed by her are become excellent English scholars for she does not chuse they should aspire to any thing more She is universally beloved and will be universally regretted On a conversation with Annette the other day in which this topic was touched upon she said that as her book of life now verged towards the last page it gave her great  satisfaction to reflect that she should not fear to look at the word Finis having inculcated in every line that goodness is the best security for happiness  'The hour of death' added Emma for she is now grown rather sententious 'is the hell of the wick∣ed the purgatory of the doubtful and the heaven of the virtuous'  Mr Balance is still alive and as much respected as ever Sir Sidney who is Mr Balance's senior by a year being now seventyfive is also living in all the vigour of health and strength He can still play at cricket and quoits and pitch the bar as well as ever and it was but the other day he was re∣quested to let his name stand in a tontine instead of that of a fashionable young man of twenty The ve∣nerable and amiable Lady Roebuck is also livingHer employment is the care of our hero's children out of seven three of whom are alive two boys and a girl The baronet has long since given over his idea of augmenting his grandeur as to himself but having recently  'done the state some service'  he is promised a peerage in favour of Charles's second son by the name and title of Sidney Roebuck Earl of Castlewick  As to Charles and Annette little more need be said Complete in beauty goodness clegance and  virtue no wonder they are completely happy Nor is the goodness and virtue of this amiable commu∣nity of friends selfishly consined It transfuses its conscious blessings to all around Charles's dar∣ling passion for patronizing worth and merit aided by Sir Sidney flows now in its right channel All are sure of encouragement who worthily apply for it nor is there an individual in either Castlewick or Little Hockley that does not feel and enjoy the gene∣rous influence of their wideextended philanthropy  These fortunate places are now equally reasonable and equally happy Both know the advantages re∣sulting from mild control and honourable obedience In short they are a type of the country at largeEvery individual is thankful to the power that se∣cures his safety protects his property and succours his family and there is not one among them sti∣mulated by these principles and encouraged by their patrons that would not nobly risk his life were it necessary in defence of the wisest of constitutions and the best of kings  THE END
