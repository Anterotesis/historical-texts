 THE SONGS CHORUSES c  Price SIX PENCE  THE SONGS CHORUSES AND SERIOUS DIALOGUE OF THE MASQUE CALLED The Institution of the GARTER OR ARTHUR'S ROUND TABLE restored  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET and P A DE HONDT in the STRAND MDCCLXXI  Advertisement  THE eager and almost universal Curiosity which the late  Installation  of the  Knights of the Order of the Garter  excited in the  Publick  seemed in a manner to command our Attention and justify our Endeavors to exhibit a Representation of it in the following Masque The Difficulty was to give an adequate Idea in a small Compass of the various Circumstances of this great Solemnity consisting of the  Installation Procession  and  Feast  The late Mr  Gilbert West  published some Years ago a Dramatick Poem called  The Institution of the Order of the Garter  which has been much admired It was however impossible to bring it on the Stage as it was originally written because though rich in Machinery it was little more than a Poem in Dialogue without  Action Some select Parts of it however with a few necessary Alterations and the Addition of some comic Scenes were thought a proper Vehicle for the different Ceremonies of this great Festival The Scene is laid in the Reign of  Edward  the Third who was the Founder of the Order after having restored that of the  Knights of the Round Table  which we have supposed with some Writers to be continued at the Institution of the Garter  No Expence has been spared nor we hope any Object of Attention overlooked which might conduce to make the following Masque as short as various and as faithful to the original Institution as possible  The Songs Choruses and Serious Dialogue are published that they may be better underderstood from the Stage The comic Parts which are intended merely for the Preparation of the principal Scenes are not printed as they would lose much of their Effect by being separated from the Action of the Performer  Mr  West  in order to give a greater Variety and to introduce some particular Characters into  his Poem has taken as he acknowleges in a Note the Advantage of a Licence usually allowed to Poets of departing a little from Chronology and postponing the Institution of the Order for a few Years  Under the Sanction of this Authority we have ventured to make use of the same poetical Licence by throwing the Institution of the Order as many Years backward as Mr  West  has brought it forward We have made the Black Prince nine Years younger than he was when he was Knighted and we flatter ourselves that this Anachronism will be excused for the Sake of the Application  Some other Liberties of less Consequence are necessarily taken for the Sake of rendering the whole more Theatrical we have had too long an Experience of the publick Indulgence not to know that they will be readily overlooked should the rest of the Performance have the good Fortune to be approved  THE SONGS CHORUSES c IN THE MASQUE CALLED The Institution of the GARTER  After the OVERTURE The Curtain rises and discovers In SCENE the FIRST THREE SPIRITS  FIRST SPIRIT  HITHER all ye heav'nly pow'rs  From your empyreal bow'rs  From the fields for ever gay  From the starpav'd milky way  From the moon's relucent horn  From the star that wakes the morn  From the bow whose mingling dyes  Sweetly chear the frowning skies  From the silver cloud that sails  Shadowy o'er the darken'd vales  From the elysiums of the sky  Spirits immortal hither fly  CHORUS OF SPIRITS  Fly and thro' the limpid air  Guard in pomp the sliding car  Which to his terrestrial throne  Wafts Britannia's Genius down  SECOND SPIRIT  Hither all ye heav'nly pow'rs  From your empyreal bow'rs  Chiefly ye whose brows divine  Crown'd with starry circlets shine  Who in various labours try'd  Once Britannia's strength and pride  Now in everlasting rest  Share the glories of the blest  Peers and nobles of the sky  Spirits immortal hither fly  CHORUS of BARDS and SPIRITS answer  We fly and charm the limpid air  While the softlysliding car  To his seaencircled throne  Wafts Britannia's Genius down  THIRD SPIRIT  Hither too ye tuneful throng  Masters of inchanting song  Sacred bards whose rapt'rous strains  Sooth the toiling hero's pains  Sooth the patriot's gen'rous cares  Sweetly thro' their ravish'd ears  Whisp'ring to th' immortal mind  Heav'nly visions hopes refin'd  Hopes of endless peace and fame  Safe from envy's blasting flame  Pure sincere in those abodes  Where to throngs of list'ning gods  Hymning Bards to virtue's praise  Tune their neverdying lays  Sweet encomiasts of the sky  Spirits immortal hither fly  The scene opens and discovers the Genius of England descending attended by Spirits and Bards who sing the following Chorus  We wake our harps to

patronage  Of Cappadocian GEORGE Britannia's Saint  CHIEF DRUID  A plan of glory which beyond the reach  Of his own conqu'ring arms may propagate  The sovereignty of Britain and erect  Her monarchs

mists  It haply hath contracted from a long  Unebbing current of prosperity  His intellectual eyeFrom this day's choice  Of his first colleagues shall succeeding times  Of Edward judge and on his fame pronounce  For dignities and titles when misplac'd  Upon the vicious the corrupt and vile  Like princely virgins to low peasants match'd  Descend from their nobility and soil'd  By base alliance not their pride alone  And native splendor lose but shame retort  Ev'n on the sacred throne from whence they sprung  So may the lustre of this order bright  This eldest child of chivalry be stain'd  If at her first espousals her great sire  Caught by the specious outsides that deceive  And captivate the world admit the suit  Of vain pretenders void of real worth  Light empty bubbles by the wanton gale  Of fortune swell'd and only form'd to dance  And glitter in the sunshine of a court  CHIEF DRUID  We will attend thee spirit from thy hallow'd lips  Breathe forth the sacred oracles of truth  GENIUS  And you immortal bards charm with your lays  The sacred songs of virtue the pure air  That evil sprites if any such lurk here  May quit the hallow'd and enchanted ground  Nor counteract our sacred

of the blest to share  SONG  FIRST BARD  I  Ye southern gales that ever fly  In frolick April's vernal train  Who as you skim along the sky  Dip your light pinions in the main  Then shake them fraught with genial show'rs  O'er blooming Flora's primrosebow'rs  II  Now cease awhile your wanton sport  Now drive each threat'ning cloud away  Then to the flow'ry vale resort  And hither all its sweets convey  And ever as you dance along  With softest murmurs aid our song  Repeat the chorus Gentle spirit  c  SCENE IV  The Chapel of St  GEORGE  The  KNIGHTS  seated in their Stalls  King  Edward

nation ever fam'd in war  Lo heav'n descends thy festivals to share  Celestial Bards in living lays shall sing  BRITANNIA's glories and her MATCHLESS KING  End of the  MASQUE  The following  EXTRACTS  from  Selden's Titles of Honor  and  Ashmole's Order of the Garter  are inserted to shew the Authority upon which we have founded some Part of our  Installation  AND so much the rather also because we know by others of our own country that in the selfsame year a solemn and great meeting of Knights was appointed by the King at Windsor Castle for the setting up of his  Round Table  there c  And it seems that out of the plot and purpose of this  Round Table  at Windsor erected in the same year wherein the Order of the New Garter was instituted and appointed to be celebrated on St George's day of the same year as we may collect out of Froissart also the Order itself had chief part at least of its original And the other traditions touching the Garter of the Queen or of the Countess of Kent and Salisbury may well stand with this thus far that the word and the use of the Garter began as the traditions suppose but that the Order was raised chiefly out of this of the  Round Table  of that time as out of a Seminary For the  Round Table  was in special use in those ages for the drawing together of the braver Knights and Ladies c  Froissart likewise says  Et ordonna  Edward the Third  que d'an en an le jour Saint Gregore s'en feroit la feste dedans le chateau de Vindesore le quell chateau le Roy Artur avoit fait faire autreffois edifier et in icelui tenir la noble Table ronde  c  SELDEN edit pag  King Edward the Third having designed to restore the honor of the  Round Table  held a juste at Windsor in the th year of his reign but there is an old manuscript chronicle that has these words King Edward in his th year begun his  Round Table  and ordained the  day annually to be kept there at Whitsuntide and this meeting in truth occasioned the foundation of the most noble Order of the Garter as shall be noted by and by  Ashmole  edit pag  He Edward the Third did thereupon first design as being invited thereto by its antient fame the restauration of King Arthur's  Round Table  which he exhibited with magnificent hastiludes and general justs to invite hither the gallant and active spirits from abroad and upon discovery of their courage and ability in the exercise of arms to draw them to his party and oblige them to himself  Though King Edward so far advanced the honor of a Garter as that the Order did derive its title and denomination from it yet it is most evident that he founded this more famous Order not to give reputation to or perpetuate an effeminate occasion but to adorn martial virtue with honor rewards and splendor to increase virtue and valour in the hearts of his nobility or as Andrew du Chesne saith to honor military virtue with some glorious favours and rewards that so true nobility as is noted in the preface to the black book of the Order after long and hazardous adventures should not enviously be deprived of that honor which it hath really deserved and that active and hardy youth might not want a spur in the profession of virtue which is to be esteemed glorious and eternal  Upon these grounds no doubt does our learned Selden affirm that this Order was raised chiefly out of the  Round Table  of that time the Knights thereof being in the flower of that age as out of a seminary  Ashmole  page  FINIS
