MDCCLVII  TO The Reverend Mr Hume Author of DOUGLAS a Tragedy  MY DEAR SIR  IT was the practice of the antients to address their compositions only to friends and equals and to render their dedications monuments of regard and affection not of servility and flattery In those days of ingenuous and candid liberty a dedication did honour to the person to whom it  was addressed without degrading the author If any partiality appeared towards the patron it was at least the partiality of friendship and affection  ANOTHER instance of true liberty of which antient times can alone afford us an example is the liberty of thought which engaged men of letters however different in their abstract opinions to maintain a mutual friendship and regard and never to quarrel about principles while they agreed in inclinations and manners Science was often the subject of disputation never of animosity  Cicero  an academic addressed his philosophical treatises sometimes to  Brutus  a stoic sometimes to  Atticus  an epicurean  I HAVE been seized with a strong desire of renewing these laudable practices of antiquity by addressing the following dissertations to you my good friend For such I will ever call and esteem you notwithstanding the opposition which prevails between us with regard to many of our speculative tenets These differences of opinion I have only found to enliven our conversation while our common passion for science and letters served as a cement to our friendship I still admired your genius even when I imagined that you lay under the influence of prejudice and you sometimes told me that you excused my errors on account of the candor and sincerity which you thought accompanied them  BUT to tell truth it is less my admiration of your fine genius which has engaged me to make this address to you than my esteem of your character and my affection to your person That generosity of mind which ever accompanies you that cordiality of friendship that spirited honour and integrity have long interested me strongly in your behalf and have made me desirous that a monument of our mutual amity should be publicly erected and if possible be preserved to posterity  I own too that I have the ambition to be the first who shall in public express his admiration of your noble tragedy of DOUGLAS one of the most  interesting and pathetic pieces that was ever exhibited on any theatre Should I give it the preference to the  Merope  of  Maffei  and to that of  Voltaire  which it resembles in its subject should I affirm that it contained more fire and spirit than the former more tenderness and simplicity than the latter I might be accused of partiality And how could I entirely acquit myself after the professions of friendship which I have made you But the unfeigned tears which flowed from every eye in the numerous representations which were made of it on this theatre the unparalleled command which you appeared to have over every affection of the human breast These are incontestible proofs that you possess the true theatric genius of  Shakespear  and  Otway  refined from the unhappy barbarism of the one and licentiousness of the other  MY enemies you know and I own even sometimes my friends have reproached me with the love of paradoxes and singular opinions and I expect to be exposed to the same imputation on account of the character which I have here given of your DOUGLAS I shall be told no doubt that I had artfully chosen the only time when this high esteem of that piece could be regarded as a paradox to wit before its publication and that not being able to contradict in this particular the sentiments of the public I have at least resolved to go before them But I shall be amply compensated  for all these pleasantries if you accept this testimony of my regard and believe me to be with the greatest sincerity  DEAR SIR  Your most affectionate Friend and humble Servant DAVID HUME  EDINBURGH  Jan  DISSERTATION I NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION  DISSERTATION I The Natural History of Religion  INTRODUCTION  AS every enquiry which regards Religion is of the utmost importance there are two questions in particular which challenge our principal attention to wit that concerning it's foundation in reason and that concerning its origin in human nature Happily the first question which is the most important admits of the most obvious at least the clearest solution The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author and no rational enquirer can after serious reflexion suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary principles of genuine Theism and Religion But the other question concerning the origin of religion in human nature admits of some more difficulty The belief of invisible intelligent power has been very generally diffused over the human race in all places and in all ages but it has neither perhaps been so universal as to admit of no exceptions  nor has it been in any degree uniform in the ideas which it has suggested Some nations have been discovered who entertained no sentiments of Religion if travellers and historians may be credited and no two nations and scarce any two men have ever agreed precisely in the same sentiments It would appear therefore that this preconception springs not from an original instinct or primary impression of nature such as gives rise to selflove affection betwixt the sexes love of progeny gratitude resentment since every instinct of this kind has been found absolutely universal in all nations and ages and has always a precise determinate object which it inflexibly pursues The first religious principles must be secondary such as may easily be perverted by various accidents and causes and whose operation too in some cases may by an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances be altogether prevented What those principles are which give rise to the original belief and what those accidents and causes are which direct its operation is the subject of our present enquiry  I  IT appears to me that if we consider the improvement of human society from rude beginnings to a state of greater perfection polytheism or idolatry was and necessarily must have been the first and most antient religion of mankind This opinion I shall endeavour to confirm by the following arguments  'TIS a matter of fact uncontestable that about years ago all mankind were idolaters The doubtful and sceptical principles of a few philosophers or the theism and that too not entirely pure of one or two nations form no objection worth regarding Behold then the clear testimony of history The farther we mount up into antiquity the more do we find mankind plunged into idolatry No marks no symptoms of any more perfect religion The most antient records of human race still present us with polytheism as the popular and established system The north the south the east the west give their unanimous testimony to the same fact What can be opposed to so full an evidence  As far as writing or history reaches mankind in antient times appear universally to have been polytheists Shall we assert that in more antient times before the knowledge of letters or the discovery of any art or science men entertained the principles of pure theism That is while they were ignorant and barbarous they discovered truth But fell into error as soon as they acquired learning and politeness  BUT in this assertion you not only contradict all appearance of probability but also our present experience concerning the principles and opinions of barbarous nations The savage tribes of  America Africa  and  Asia  are all idolaters Not a single exception to this rule Insomuch that were a traveller to transport himself into any unknown region if he found inhabitants cultivated with arts and sciences tho' even upon that supposition there are odds against their being theists yet could he notsafely till farther enquiry pronounce any thing on that head But if he found them ignorant and barbarous he might beforehand declare them idolaters and there scarce is a possibility of his being mistaken  IT seems certain that according to the natural progress of human thought the ignorant multitude must first entertain some groveling and familiar notion of superior powers before they stretch their conception to that perfect being who bestowed order on the whole frame of nature We may as reasonably imagine that men inhabited palaces before huts and cottages or studied geometry before agriculture as assert that the deity appeared to them a pure spirit omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent before he was apprehended to be a powerful tho' limited being with human passions and appetites limbs and organs The mind rises gradually from inferior to superior By abstracting from what is imperfect it forms an idea of perfection And slowly distinguishing the nobler parts of its frame from the grosser it learns to transfer only the former much elevated and refined to its divinity Nothing could disturb this natural progress of thought but some obvious and invincible argument which might immediately lead the mind into the pure principles of theism and make it overleap at one bound the vast interval which is interposed betwixt the human and the divine nature  But tho' I allow that the order and frame of the universe when accurately examined affords such an argument yet I can never think that this consideration could have an influence on manking when they formed their first rude notions of religion  THE causes of objects which are quite familiar to us never strike our attention or curiosity and however extraordinary or surprizing these objects may be in themselves they are past over by the raw and ignorant multitude without much examination or enquiry  Adam  rising at once in paradise and in the full perfection of his faculties would naturally as represented by  Milton  be astonished at the glorious appearances of nature the heavens the air the earth his own organs and members and would be led to ask whence this wonderful scene arose But a barbarous necessitous animal such as man is on the first origin of society pressed by such numerous wants and passions has no leisure to admire the regular face of nature or make enquiries concerning the cause of objects to which from his infancy he has been gradually accustomed On the contrary the more regular and uniform that is the more  perfect nature appears the more is he familiarized to it and the less inclined to scrutinize and examine it A monstrous birth excites his curiosity and is deemed a prodigy It alarms him from its novelty and immediately sets him a trembling and sacrificing and praying But an animal compleat in all its limbs and organs is to him an ordinary spectacle and produces no religious opinion or affection Ask him whence that animal arose he will tell you from the copulation of its parents And these whence From the copulation of theirs A few removes satisfy his curiosity and sets the objects at such a distance that he entirely loses  ight of them Imagine not that he will so much as start the question whence the first animal much less whence the whole system or united fabric of the universe arose Or if you start such a question to him expect not that he will employ his mind with any anxiety about a subject so remote so uninteresting and which so much exceeds the bounds of his capacity  BUT farther if men were at first led into the belief of one supreme being by reasoning from the frame of nature they could never possibly  leave that belief in order to embrace idolatry but the same principles of reasoning which at first produced and diffused over mankind so magnificent an opinion must be able with greater facility to preserve it The first invention and proof of any doctrine is infinitely more difficult than the supporting and retaining it  THERE is a great difference betwixt historical facts and speculative opinions nor is the knowledge of the one propagated in the same manner with that of the other An historical fact while it passes by oral tradition from eyewitnesses and contemporaries is disguised in every successive narration and may at last retain but very small if any resemblance of the original truth on which it was founded The frail memories of men their love of exaggeration their supine carelessness these principles if not corrected by books and writing soon pervert the account of historical events where argument or reasoning has little or no place nor can ever recal the truth which has once escaped those narrations 'Tis thus the fables of  Hercules Theseus Bacchus  are supposed to have been originally founded in true history corrupted by tradition But with regard to speculative  opinions the case is far otherwise If these opinions be founded in arguments so clear and obvious as to carry conviction with the generality of mankind the same arguments which at first diffused the opinions will still preserve them in their original purity If the arguments be more abstruse and more remote from vulgar apprehensions the opinions will always be confined to a few persons and as soon as men leave the contemplation of the arguments the opinions will immediately be lost and buried in oblivion Which ever side of this dilemma we take it must appear impossible that theism could from reasoning have been the primary religion of human race and have afterwards by its corruption given birth to idolatry and to all the various superstitions of the heathen world Reason when very obvious prevents these corruptions When abstruse it keeps the principles entirely from the knowledge of the vulgar who are alone liable to corrupt any principles or opinions  II  IF we would therefore indulge our curiosity in enquiring concerning the origin of religion we must turn our thoughts towards idolatry or polytheism the primitive Religion of uninstructed mankind  WERE men led into the apprehension of invisible intelligent power by a contemplation of the works of nature they could never possibly entertain any conception but of one single being who bestowed existence and order on this vast machine and adjusted all its parts according to one regular plan or connected system For tho' to persons of a certain turn of mind it may not appear altogether absurd that several independent beings endowed with superior wisdom might conspire in the contrivance and execution of one regular plan yet is this a mere arbitrary supposition which even if allowed possible must be confessed neither to be supported by probability nor necessity All things in the universe are evidently of a piece Every thing is adjusted to every thing One  design prevails thro' the whole And this uniformity leads the mind to acknowledge one author because the conception of different authors without any distinction of attributes or operations serves only to give perplexity to the imagination without bestowing any satisfaction on the understanding  The statue of  Laocoon  as we learn from  Pliny  was the work of three artists But 'tis certain that were we not told so we should never have concluded that a groupe of figures cut from one stone and united in one plan was not the work and contrivance of one statuary To ascribe any single effect to the combination of several causes is not surely a natural and obvious supposition    ON the other hand if leaving the works of nature we trace the footsteps of invisible power in the various and contrary events of human life we are necessarily led into polytheism and to the acknowledgment of several limited and imperfect deities Storms and tempests ruin what is nourished by the sun The sun destroys what is fostered by the moisture of dews and rains War may be favourable to a nation whom the inclemency of the seasons afflicts with famine Sickness and pestilence may depopulate a kingdom amidst the most profuse plenty The same nation is not at the  same time equally successful by sea and by land And a nation which now triumphs over its enemies may anon submit to their more prosperous arms In short the conduct of events or what we call the plan of a particular providence is so full of variety and uncertainty that if we suppose it immediately ordered by any intelligent beings we must acknowledge a contrariety in their designs and intentions a constant combat of opposite powers and a repentance or change of intention in the same power from impotence or levity Each nation has its tutelar deity Each element is subjected to its invisible power or agent The province of each god is separate from that of another Nor are the operations of the same god always certain and invariable To day he protects To morrow he abandons us Prayers and sacrifices rites and ceremonies well or ill performed are the sources of his favour or enmity and produce all the good or ill fortune which are to be found amongst mankind  WE may conclude therefore that in all nations which have embraced polytheism or idolatry the first ideas of religion arose not from a contemplation of the works of nature  but from a concern with regard to the events of life and from the incessant hopes and fears which actuate the human mind Accordingly we find that all idolaters having separated the provinces of their deities have recourse to that invisible agent to whose authority they are immediately subjected and whose province it is to superintend that course of actions in which they are at any time engaged  Juno  is invoked at marriages  Lucina  at births  Neptune  receives the prayers of seamen and  Mars  of warriors The husbandman cultivates his field under the protection of  Ceres  and the merchant acknowledges the authority of  Mercury  Each natural event is supposed to be governed by some intelligent agent and nothing prosperous or adverse can happen in life which may not be the subject of peculiar prayers or thanksgivings  Fragilis et laboriosa mortalitas in partes ista digessit infirmitatis suae memor ut portionibus quisquis eoleret quo maxime indigeret  Plin lib ii cap So early as  Hesiod's  time there were deities  Oper Dier  lib i ver But the task to be performed by these seems still too great for their number The provinces of the deities were so subdivided that there was even a God of  Sneezing  See  Arist Probl  Sect cap The province of copulation suitable to the importance and dignity of it was divided amongst several deities    IT must necessarily indeed be allowed that in order to carry men's attention beyond the visible course of things or lead them into any inference concerning invisible intelligent power they must be actuated by some passion which prompts their thought and reflection some motive which urges their first enquiry But what passion shall we here have recourse to for explaining an effect of such mighty consequence Not speculative curiosity surely or the pure love of truth That motive is too refined for such gross apprehensions and would lead men into enquiries concerning the frame of nature a subject too large and comprehensive for their narrow capacities No passions therefore can be supposed to work upon such barbarians but the ordinary affections of human life the anxious concern for happiness the dread of future misery the terror of death the thirst of revenge the appetite for food and other necessaries Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature especially the latter men scrutinize with a trembling curiosity the course of future causes and examine the various and  contrary events of human life And in this disordered scene with eyes still more disordered and astonished they see the first obscure traces of divinity  III  WE are placed in this world as in a great theatre where the true springs and causes of every event are entirely unknown to us nor have we either sufficient wisdom to foresee or power to prevent those ills with which we are continually threatened We hang in perpetual suspense betwixt life and death health and sickness plenty and want which are distributed amongst the human species by secret and unknown causes whose operation is oft unexpected and always unaccountable These  unknown causes  then become the constant object of our hope and fear and while the passions are kept in perpetual alarm by an anxious expectation of the events the imagination is equally employed in forming ideas of those powers on which we have so entire a dependance Could men anatomize nature according to the most probable at least the most intelligible philosophy they would find that these causes are nothing but the particular fabric and structure of the minute parts of their own bodies and of external objects and that by a regular and constant machinery all the events are produced  about which they are so much concerned But this philosophy exceeds the comprehension of the ignorant multitude who can only conceive the  unknown causes  in a general and confused manner tho' their imagination perpetually employed on the same subject must labour to form some particular and distinct idea of them The more they consider these causes themselves and the uncertainty of their operation the less satisfaction do they meet with in their research and however unwilling they must at last have abandoned so arduous an attempt were it not for a propensity in human nature which leads into a system that gives them some seeming satisfaction  THERE is an universal tendency amongst mankind to conceive all beings like themselves and to transfer to every object those qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted and of which they are intimately conscious We find human faces in the moon armies in the clouds and by a natural propensity if not corrected by experience and reflection ascribe malice and goodwill to every thing that hurts or pleases us Hence the frequency and beauty of the  prosopopoeia  in poetry where trees  mountains and streams are personisied and the inanimate parts of nature acquire sentiment and passion And tho' these poetical figures and expressions gain not on the belief they may serve at least to prove a certain tendency in the imagination without which they could neither be beautiful nor natural Nor is a rivergod or hamadryad always taken for a mere poetical or imaginary personage but may sometimes enter into the real creed of the ignorant vulgar while each grove or field is represented as possest of a particular  genius  or invisible power which inhabits and protects it Nay philosophers cannot entirely exempt themselves from this natural frailty but have oft ascribed to inanimate matter the horror of a  vacuum  sympathies antipathies and other affections of human nature The absurdity is not less while we cast our eyes upwards and transferring as is too usual human passions and infirmities to the deity represent him as jealous and revengeful capricious and partial and in short a wicked and foolish man in every respect but his superior power and authority No wonder then that mankind being placed in such an absolute ignorance of causes and being at the same time so anxious concerning their future  fortunes should immediatly acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers possest of sentiment and intelligence The  unknown causes  which continually employ their thought appearing always in the same aspect are all apprehended to be of the same kind or species Nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought and reason and passion and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves  IN proportion as any man's course of life is governed by accident we always find that he encreases in superstition as may particularly be observed of gamesters and sailors who tho' of all mankind the least capable of serious meditation abound most in frivolous and superstitious apprehensions The gods says  Coriolanus  in  Dionysius  Lib viii  have an influence in every affair but above all in war where the event is so uncertain All human life especially before the institution of order and good government being subject to fortuitous accidents it is natural that superstition should prevail every where in barbarous ages and put men on the most  earnest enquiry concerning those invisible powers who dispose of their happiness or misery Ignorant of astronomy and the anatomy of plants and animals and too little curious to observe the admirable adjustment of final causes they remain still unacquainted with a first and supreme creator and with that infinitely perfect spirit who alone by his almighty will bestowed order on the whole frame of nature Such a magnificent idea is too big for their narrow conceptions which can neither observe the beauty of the work nor comprehend the grandeur of its author They suppose their deities however potent and invisible to be nothing but a species of human creatures perhaps raised from among mankind and retaining all human passions and appetites along with corporeal limbs and organs Such limited beings tho' masters of human fate being each of them incapable of extending his influence every where must be vastly multiplied in order to answer that variety of events which happen over the whole face of nature Thus every place is stored with a crowd of local deities and thus idolatry has prevailed and still prevails among the greatest part of uninstructed mankind  The following lines of  Euripides  are so much to the present purpose that I cannot forbear quoting them  HECUBA  There is nothing secure in the world no glory no prosperity The gods toss all life into confusion mix every thing with its reverse that all of us from our ignorance and uncertainty may pay them the more worship and reverence    ANY of the human affections may lead us into the notion of invisible intelligent power hope as well as fear gratitude as well as affliction But if we examine our own hearts or observe what passes around us we shall find that men are much ostener thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the agreeable passions Prosperity is easily received as our due and few questions are asked concerning its cause or author It engenders cheerfulness and activity and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every social and sensual pleasure And during this state of mind men have little leisure or inclination to think of the unknown invisible regions On the other hand every disastrous accident alarms us and sets us on enquiries concerning the principles whence it arose Apprehensions spring up with regard to futurity And the mind sunk into diffidence terror and melancholy has recourse to every  method of appeasing those secret intelligent powers on whom our fortune is supposed entirely to depend  NO topic is more usual with all popular divines than to display the advantages of affliction in bringing men to a due sense of religion by subduing their confidence and sensuality which in times of prosperity make them forgetful of a divine providence Nor is this topic confined merely to modern religions The ancients have also employed it  Fortune has never liberally without envy  says a  Greek  historian  Diod Sic Lib iii    bestowed an unmixt happiness on mankind but with all her gifts has ever conjoined some disastrous circumstance in order to chastize men into a reverence for the gods whom in a continued course of prosperity they are apt to neglect and forget  WHAT age or period of life is the most addicted to superstition The weakest and most timid What sex The same answer must be given  The leaders and examples of every kind of superstition  says  Strabo  Lib vii    are the women These excite the men to devotion and supplications and the observance of religious days It is rare to meet  with one that lives apart from the females and yet is addicted to such practises And nothing can for this reason be more improbable than the account given of an order of men amongst the  Getes  who practised celibacy and were notwithstanding the most religious fanatics  A method of reasoning which would lead us to entertain a very bad idea of the devotion of monks did we not know by an experience not so common perhaps in  Strabo's  days that one may practice celibacy and profess chastity and yet maintain the closest connexions and most entire sympathy with that timorous and pious sex  IV  THE only point of theology in which we shall find a consent of mankind almost universal is that there is invisible intelligent power in the world But whether this power be supreme or subordinate whether confined to one being or distributed amongst several what attributes qualities connexions or principles of action ought to be ascribed to those beings concerning all these points there is the widest difference in the popular systems of theology Our ancestors in  Europe  before the revival of letters believed as we do at present that there was one supreme God the author of nature whose power tho' in itself uncontrolable yet was often exerted by the interposition of his angels and subordinate ministers who executed his sacred purposes But they also believed that all nature was full of other invisible powers fairies goblins elves sprights beings stronger and mightier than men but much inferior to the celestial natures who surround the throne of God Now suppose that any one in those ages had denied the existence of God and of his angels would not his impiety justly have  deserved the appellation of atheism even tho' he had still allowed by some odd capricious reasoning that the popular stories of elves and fairies were just and wellgrounded The difference on the one hand betwixt such a person and a genuine theist is infinitely greater than that on the other betwixt him and one that absolutely excludes all invisible intelligent power And it is a fallacy merely from the casual resemblance of names without any conformity of meaning to rank such opposite opinions under the same denomination  TO any one who considers justly of the matter it will appear that the gods of all polytheists or idolaters are no better than the elves or fairies of our ancestors and merit as little any pious worship or veneration These pretended religionists are really a kind of superstitious atheists and acknowledge no being that corresponds to our idea of a deity No first principle of mind or thought No supreme government and administration No divine contrivance or intention in the fabric of the world  THE  Chinese  when  Pere le Comte  their prayers are not answered beat their idols The deities of the  Laplanders  are any large stone which they meet with of an extraordinary shape  Regnard Voïage de Lapponie  The  Egyptian  mythologists in order to account for animal worship said that the gods pursued by the violence of earthborn men who were their enemies had formerly been obliged to disguise themselves under the semblance of beasts  Diod Sic lib i Lucian de Sacrificiis  Ovid  alludes to the same tradition Metam lib v l So also Manilius lib iv  The  Caunii  a nation in the lesser  Asia  resolving to admit no strange gods amongst them regularly at certain seasons assembled themselves compleatly armed beat the air with their lances and proceeded in that manner to their frontiers in order as they said to expel the foreign deities  Herodot lib i    Not even the immortal gods  said some  German  nations to  Caesar are a match for the Suevi  Caes Comment de bell Gallico lib iv    MANY ills says  Dione  in  Homer  to  Venus  wounded by  Diomede  many ills my daughter have the gods inflicted on men And many ills in return have men inflicted on the gods  Lib ix  We  need but open any classic author to meet with these gross representations of the deities and  Longinus  Cap ix  with reason observes that such ideas of the divine nature if literally taken contain a true atheism  SOME writers  Pere Brumoy Theatre des Grecs Fontenelle Histoire des Oracles  have been surprised that the the impieties of  Aristophanes  should have been tolerated nay publickly acted and applauded by the  Athenians  a people so superstitious and so jealous of the public religion that at that very time they put  Socrates  to death for his imagined incredulity But these writers consider not that the ludicrous familiar images under which the gods are represented by that comic poet instead of appearing impious were the genuine lights in which the ancients conceived their divinities What conduct can be more criminal or mean than that of  Jupiter  in the  Amphitryon  Yet that play which represented his gallant exploits was supposed so agreeable to him that it was always acted in  Rome  by public authority when the State was threatened with pestilence famine or any general calamity  Arnob lib vii  The  Romans  supposed that like all old  letchers he would be highly pleased with the rehearsal of his former feats of activity and vigour and that no topic was so proper upon which to flatter his pride and vanity  THE  Lacedemonians  says  Xenophon  De Laced Rep  always during war put up their petitions very early in the morning in order to be beforehand with their enemies and by being the first solicitors preengage the gods in their favour We may gather from  Seneca  Epist xli  that it was usual for the votaries in the temples to make interest with the beadles or sextons in order to have a seat near the image of the deity that they might be the best heard in their prayers and applications to him The  Tyrians  when besieged by  Alexander  threw chains on the statue of  Hercules  to prevent that deity from deserting to the enemy  Quint Curtius lib iv cap Diod Sic lib xvii    Augustus  having twice lost his fleet by storms forbad  Neptune  to be carried in procession along with the other gods and fancied that he had sufficiently revenged himself by that expedient  Sueton in vita Aug cap  After  Germanicus's  death the people were so enraged at their gods that they stoned  them in their temples and openly renounced all allegiance to them  Id in vita Cal cap    TO ascribe the origin and fabric of the universe to these imperfect beings never enters into the imagination of any polytheist or idolater  Hesiod  whose writings along with those of  Homer  contained the canonical system of the heathens  Herodot lib ii Lucian  Jupiter confutatus de luctu Saturn  c    Hesiod  I say supposes gods and men to have sprung equally from the unknown powers of nature  Hes Opera Dies l  And thro' the whole theogony of that author  Pandora  is the only instance of creation or a voluntary production and she too was formed by the gods merely from despight to  Prometheus  who had furnished men with stolen fire from the celestial regions  Theog l  The ancient mythologists indeed seem throughout to have rather embraced the idea of generation than that of creation or formation and to have thence accounted for the origin of this universe  OVID who lived in a learned age and had been instructed by philosophers in the principles of a  divine creation or formation of the world finding that such an idea would not agree with the popular mythology which he delivers leaves it in a manner loose and detached from his system  Quisquis fuit ille Deorum  Metamorph lib i l  Whichever of the gods it was says he that dissipated the chaos and introduced order into the universe It could neither be  Saturn  he knew nor  Jupiter  nor  Neptune  nor any of the received deities of paganism His theological system had taught him nothing upon that head and he leaves the matter equally undetermined  Diodorus Siculus  Lib i  beginning his work with an enumeration of the most reasonable opinions concerning the origin of the world makes no mention of a deity or intelligent mind tho' it is evident from his history that that author had a much greater proneness to superstition than to irreligion And in another passage  Id ibid  talking of the  Ichthyophages  a nation in  India  he says that there being so great difficulty in accounting for their descent we must conclude them to be  aborigines  without any beginning of their generation propagating their race from all eternity  as some of the physiologers in treating of the origin of nature have justly observed  "But in such subjects as these"  adds the historian  "which exceed all human capacity it may well happen that those who discourse the most know the least reaching a specious appearance of truth in their reasonings while extremely wide of the real truth and matter of fact"  A strange sentiment in our eyes to be embraced by a profest and zealous religionist  The same author who can thus account for the origin of the world without a Deity esteems it impious to explain from physical causes the common accidents of life earthquakes inundations and tempests and devoutly ascribes these to the anger of  Jupiter  or  Neptune  A plain proof whence he derived his ideas of religion See lib xv pag Ex edit Rhodomanni  But it was merely by accident that the question concerning the origin of the world did ever in antient times enter into religious systems or was treated of by theologers The philosophers alone made profession of delivering systems of this nature and it was pretty late too before these bethought themselves of having recourse to a mind or supreme intelligence as the first cause of all So far was it from being esteemed  prophane in those days to account for the origin of things without a deity that  Thales Anaximenes Heraclitus  and others who embraced that system of cosmogony past unquestioned while  Anaxagoras  the first undoubted theist among the philosophers was perhaps the first that ever was accused of atheism  It will be easy to give a reason why  Thales Anaximander  and those early philosophers who really were atheists might be very orthodox in the pagan creed and why  Anaxagoras  and  Socrates  tho' real theists must naturally in antient times be esteemed impious The blind unguided powers of nature if they could produce men might also produce such beings as  Jupiter  and  Neptune  who being the most powerful intelligent existences in the world would be proper objects of worship But where a supreme intelligence the first cause of all is admitted these capricious beings if they exist at all must appear very subordinate and dependent and consequently be excluded from the rank of deities  Plato  de Leg lib x assigns this reason of the imputation thrown on  Anaxagoras  viz his denying the divinity of the stars planets and other created objects    WE are told by  Sextus Empiricus  Adversus Mathem lib ix  that  Epicurus  when a boy reading with his preceptor these verses of  Hesiod  Eldest of beings  chaos  first arose  Next  earth  widestretcht the  seat  of all  the young scholar first betrayed his inquisitive genius by asking  And choas whence  But was  told by his preceptor that he must have recourse to the philosophers for a solution of such questions And from this hint  Epicurus  left philology and all other studies in order to betake himself to that science whence alone he expected satisfaction with regard to these sublime subjects  THE common people were never likely to push their researches so far or derive from reasoning their systems of religion when philologers and mythologists we see scarce ever discovered so much penetration And even the philosophers who discoursed of such topics readily assented to the grossest theory and admitted the joint origin of gods and men from night and chaos from fire water air or whatever they established to be the ruling element  NOR was it only on their first origin that the gods were supposed dependent on the powers of nature Thro' the whole period of their existence they were subjected to the dominion of fate or destiny  Think of the force of necessity  says  Agrippa  to the  Roman  people  that force to which even the gods must submit  Dionys Halic lib vi  And  the younger  Pliny  Epist lib vi  suitable to this way of reasoning tells us that amidst the darkness horror and confusion which ensued upon the first eruption of  Vesuvius  several concluded that all nature was going to wrack and that gods and men were perishing in one common ruin  IT is great complaisance indeed if we dignify with the name of religion such an imperfect system of theology and put it on a level with latter systems which are founded on principles more just and more sublime For my part I can scarce allow the principles even of  Marcus Aurelius Plutarch  and some other  Stoics  and  Academics  tho' infinitely more refined than the pagan superstition to be worthy of the honourable denomination of theism For if the mythology of the heathens resemble the antient  European  system of spiritual beings excluding God and angels and leaving only fairies and sprights the creed of these philosophers may justly be said to exclude a deity and to leave only angels and fairies  V  BUT it is chiefly our present business to consider the gross polytheism and idolatry of the vulgar and to trace all its various appearances in the principles of human nature whence they are derived  WHOEVER learns by argument the existence of invisible intelligent power must reason from the admirable contrivance of natural objects and must suppose the world to be the workmanship of that divine being the original cause of all things But the vulgar polytheist so far from admitting that idea deifies every part of the universe and conceives all the conspicuous productions of nature to be themselves so many real divinities The fun moon and stars are all gods according to his system Fountains are inhabited by nymphs and trees by hamadryads Even monkies dogs cats and other animals often become sacred in his eyes and strike him with a religious veneration And thus however strong men's propensity to believe invisible intelligent power in nature their propensity is equally strong to rest their  attention on sensible visible objects and in order to reconcile these opposite inclinations they are led to unite the invisible power with some visible object  THE distribution also of distinct provinces to the several deities is apt to cause some allegory both physical and moral to enter into the vulgar systems of polytheism The god of war will naturally be represented as furious cruel and impetuous The god of poetry as elegant polite and amiable The god of merchandise especially in early times as thievish and deceitful The allegories supposed in  Homer  and other mythologists I allow have been often so strained that men of sense are apt entirely to reject them and to consider them as the product merely of the fancy and conceit of critics and commentators But that allegory really has place in the heathen mythology is undeniable even on the least reflection  Cupid  the son of  Venus  the Muses the daughters of memory  Prometheus  the wise brother and  Epimetheus  the foolish  Hygieia  or the goddess of health descended from  Aesculapius  or the god of physic Who sees not in these and in many other instances the plain traces of allegory  When a god is supposed to preside over any passion event or system of actions it is almost unavoidable to give him a genealogy attributes and adventures suitable to his supposed powers and influence and to carry on that similitude and comparison which is naturally so agreeable to the mind of man  ALLEGORIES indeed entirely perfect we ought not to expect as the products of ignorance and superstition there being no work of genius that requires a nicer hand or has been more rarely executed with success That  Fear  and  Terror  are the sons of  Mars  is just but why by  Venus  Hesiod Theog l  That  Harmony  is the daughter of  Venus  is regular but why by  Mars  Id ibid Plut in vita Pelop  That  Sleep  is the brother of  Death  is suitable but why describe him as enamoured of one of the Graces  Iliad xiv  And since the ancient mythologists fall into mistakes so gross and obvious we have no reason surely to expect such refined and longspun allegories as some have endeavoured to deduce from their fictions  Lucretius  was plainly seduced by the strong appearance of allegory which is observable in the pagan fictions He first addresses himself to  Venus  as to that generating power which animates renews and beautifies the universe But is soon betrayed by the mythology into incoherencies while he prays to that allegorical personage to appease the furies of her lover  Mars  An idea not drawn from allegory but from the popular religion and which  Lucretius  as an  Epicurean  could not consistently admit of    THE deities of the vulgar are so little superior to human creatures that where men are affected with strong sentiments of veneration or gratitude for any hero or public benefactor nothing can be more natural than to convert him into a god and fill the heavens after this manner with continual recruits from amongst mankind Most of the divinities of the antient world are supposed to have once been men and to have been beholden for their  apotheosis  to the admiration and affection of the people And the real history of their adventures corrupted by tradition and elevated by the marvellous became a plentiful source of fable especially in passing thro' the hands of poets allegorists and priests who successively improved upon the wonder and astonishment of the ignorant multitude  PAINTERS too and sculptors came in for their share of profit in the sacred mysteries and furnishing men with sensible representations of their  divinities whom they cloathed in human figures gave great encrease to the public devotion and determined its object It was probably for want of these arts in rude and barbarous ages that men deified plants animals and even brute unorganized matter and rather than be without a sensible object of worship affixed divinity to such ungainly forms Could any statuary of  Syria  in early times have formed a just figure of  Apollo  the conic stone  Heliogabalus  had never become the object of such profound adoration and been received as a representation of the solar deity  Herodian lib v  Jupiter Ammon  is represented by  Curtius  as a deity of the same kind lib iv cap The  Arabians  and  Pessinuntians  adored also shapeless unformed stones as their deity Arnob lib vi So much did their folly exceed that of the  Egyptians    STILPO was banished by the council of  Areopagus  for affirming that the  Minerva  in the citadel was no divinity but the workmanship of  Phidias  the sculptor  Diog Laert lib ii  What degree of reason may we expect in the religious belief of the vulgar in other nations when  Athenians  and  Areopagites  could entertain such gross conceptions  THESE then are the general principles of polytheism founded in human nature and little or nothing dependent on caprice and accident As the  causes  which bestow on us happiness or misery are in general very unknown and uncertain our anxious concern endeavours to attain a determinate idea of them and finds no better expedient than to represent them as intelligent voluntary agents like ourselves only somewhat superior in power and wisdom The limited influence of these agents and their great proximity to human weakness introduce the various distribution and division of their authority and thereby give rise to allegory The same principles naturally deisy mortals superior in power courage or understanding and produce heroworship along with fabulous history and mythological tradition in all its wild and unaccountable forms And as an invisible spiritual intelligence is an object too refined for vulgar apprehension men naturally affix it to some sensible representation such as either the more conspicuous parts of nature or the statues images and pictures which a more refined age forms of its divinities  ALMOST all idolaters of whatever age or country concur in these general principles and conceptions and even the particular characters and provinces which they assign to their deities are not extremely different  See Caesar of the religion of the Gauls De bello Gallico lib vi  The  Greek  and  Roman  travellers and conquerors without much difficulty found their own deities every where and said this is  Mercury  that  Venus  this  Mars  that  Neptune  by whatever titles the strange gods may be denominated The goddess  Hertha  of our  Saxon  ancestors seems to be no other according to  Tacitus  De moribus Germ  than the  Mater Tellus  of the  Romans  and his conjecture was evidently just  VI  THE doctrine of one supreme deity the author of nature is very antient has spread itself over great and populous nations and among them has been embraced by all ranks and condition of persons But whoever thinks that it has owed its success to the prevalent force of those invincible reasons on which it is undoubtedly founded would show himself little acquainted with the ignorance and stupidity of the people and their incurable prejudices in favour of their particular superstitions Even at this day and in  Europe  ask any of the vulgar why he believes in an omnipotent creator of the world he will never mention the beauty of final causes of which he is wholly ignorant He will not hold out his hand and bid you contemplate the suppleness and variety of joints in his fingers their bending all one way the counterpoise which they receive from the thumb the softness and fleshy parts of the inside of his hand with all the other circumstances which render that member fit for the use to which it was destined To these he has been long accustomed and he beholds them with listlessness  and unconcern He will tell you of the sudden and unexpected death of such a one The fall and bruise of such another The excessive drought of this season The cold and rains of another These he ascribes to the immediate operation of providence And such events as with good reasoners are the chief difficulties in admitting a supreme intelligence are with him the sole arguments for it  MANY theists even the most zealous and refined have denied a  particular  providence and have asserted that the Sovereign mind or first principle of all things having fixt general laws by which nature is governed gives free and uninterrupted course to these laws and disturbs not at every turn the settled order of events by particular volitions From the beautiful connexion say they and rigid observance of established rules we draw the chief argument for theism and from the same principles are enabled to answer the principal objections against it But so little is this understood by the generality of mankind that wherever they observe any one to ascribe all events to natural causes and to remove the particular interposal of a deity they are apt to suspect him of the grossest infidelity  A little philosophy  says my Lord  Bacon makes men atheists A great deal reconciles them to religion  For men being taught by superstitious prejudices to lay the stress on a wrong place when that fails them and they discover by a little reflection that the course of nature is regular and uniform their whole faith totters and falls to ruin But being taught by more reflection that this very regularity and uniformity is the strongest proof of design and of a supreme intelligence they return to that belief which they had deserted and they are now able to establish it on a firmer and more durable foundation  CONVULSIONS in nature disorders prodigies miracles tho' the most opposite to the plan of a wise superintendent impress mankind with the strongest sentiments of religion the causes of events seeming then the most unknown and unaccountable Madness fury rage and an inflamed imagination tho' they sink men nearest the level of beasts are for a like reason often supposed to be the only dispositions in which we can have any immediate communication with the deity  WE may conclude therefore upon the whole that since the vulgar in nations which have embraced the doctrine of theism still build it upon irrational and superstitious opinions they are never led into that opinion by any process of argument but by a certain train of thinking more suitable to their genius and capacity  IT may readily happen in an idolatrous nation that tho' men admit the existence of several limited deities yet may there be some one god whom in a particular manner they make the object of their worship and adoration They may either suppose that in the distribution of power and territory among the gods their nation was subjected to the jurisdiction of that particular deity or reducing heavenly objects to the model of things below they may represent one god as the prince or supreme magistrate of the rest who tho' of the same nature rules them with an authority like that which an earthly sovereign exercises over his subjects and vassals Whether this god therefore be considered as their peculiar patron or as the general sovereign of heaven his votaries will endeavour by every act to insinuate themselves into his favour and supposing him to be pleased  like themselves with praise and flattery there is no eulogy or exaggeration which will be spared in their addresses to him In proportion as men's fears or distresses become more urgent they still invent new strains of adulation and even he who outdoes his predecessors in swelling up the titles of his divinity is sure to be outdone by his successors in newer and more pompous epithets of praise Thus they proceed till at last they arrive at infinity itself beyond which there is no farther progress And it is well if in striving to get farther and to represent a magnificent simplicity they run not into inexplicable mystery and destroy the intelligent nature of their deity on which alone any rational worship or adoration can be founded While they confine themselves to the notion of a perfect being the creator of the world they coincide by chance with the principles of reason and true philosophy tho' they are guided to that notion not by reason of which they are in a great measure incapable but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar superstition  WE often find amongst barbarous nations and even sometimes amongst civilized that  when every strain of flattery has been exhausted towards arbitrary princes when every human quality has been applauded to the utmost their servile courtiers represent them at last as real divinities and point them out to the people as objects of adoration How much more natural therefore is it that a limited deity who at first is supposed only the immediate author of the particular goods and ills in life should in the end be represented as sovereign maker and modifier of the universe  EVEN where this notion of a supreme deity is already established tho' it ought naturally to lessen every other worship and abase every object of reverence yet if a nation has entertained the opinion of a subordinate tutelar divinity faint or angel their addresses to that being gradually rise upon them and encroach on the adoration due to their supreme deity The virgin  Mary  ere checkt by the reformation had proceeded from being merely a good woman to usurp many attributes of the Almighty  The  Jacobins  who denied the immaculate conception have ever been very unhappy in their doctrine even tho' political reasons have kept the Romish church from condemning it The  Cordeliers  have run away with all the popularity But in the fifteenth Century as we learn from  Boulainvilliers  an  Italian Cordelier  maintained that during the three days when  Christ  was interred the hypostatic union was dissolved and that his human nature was not a proper object of adoration during that period Without the art of divination one might foretel that so gross and impious a blasphemy would not fail to be anathematized by the people It was the occasion of great insults on the part of the  Jacobins  who now got some recompence for their misfortunes in the war about the immaculate conception See Histoirc abregée pag    God and St  Nicholas  go hand in hand in all the prayers and petitions of the  Muscovites  THUS the deity who from love converted himself into a bull in order to carry off  Europa  and who from ambition dethroned his father  Saturn  became the  Optimus Maximus  of the heathens Thus notwithstanding the sublime ideas suggested by  Moses  and the inspired writers many vulgar  Jews  seem still to have conceived the supreme Being as a mere topical deity or national protector  RATHER than relinquish this propensity to adulation religionists in all ages have involved themselves in the greatest absurdities and contradictions  HOMER in one passage calls  Oceanus  and  Tethys  the original parents of all things conformable  to the established mythology and tradition of the  Greeks  Yet in other passages he could not forbear complimenting  Jupiter  the reigning deity with that magnificent appellation and accordingly denominates him the father of gods and men He forgets that every temple every street was full of the ancestors uncles brothers and sisters of this  Jupiter  who was in reality nothing but an upstart parricide and usurper A like contradiction is observable in  Hesiod  and is so much the less excusable that his professed intention was to deliver a true genealogy of the gods  WERE there a religion and we may suspect Mahometanism of this inconsistence which sometimes painted the deity in the most sublime colours as the creator of heaven and earth sometimes degraded him nearly to a level with human creatures in his powers and faculties while at the same time it ascribed to him suitable infirmities passions and partialities of the moral kind That religion after it was extinct would also be cited as an instance of those contradictions which arise from the gross vulgar natural conceptions of mankind opposed to their continual propensity towards flattery and exaggeration  aggeration Nothing indeed would prove more strongly the divine origin of any religion than to find and happily this is the case with Christianity that it is free from a contradiction so incident to human nature  VII  IT appears certain that tho' the original notions of the vulgar represent the Divinity as a very limited being and consider him only as the particular cause of health or sickness plenty or want prosperity or adversity yet when more magnificent ideas are urged upon them they esteem it dangerous to refuse their assent Will you say that your deity is finite and bounded in his perfections may be overcome by a greater force is subject to human passions pains and infirmities has a beginning and may have an end This they dare not affirm but thinking it safest to comply with the higher encomiums they endeavour by an affected ravishment and devotion to ingratiate themselves with him As a confirmation of this we may observe that the assent of the vulgar is in this case merely verbal and that they are incapable of conceiving those sublime qualities which they seemingly attribute to the deity Their real idea of him notwithstanding their pompous language is still as poor and frivolous as ever  THAT original intelligence say the  Magians  who is the first principle of all things discovers himself  immediately  to the mind and understanding alone but has placed the sun as his image in the visible universe and when that bright luminary diffuses its beams over the earth and the firmament it is a faint copy of the glory which resides in the higher heavens If you would escape the displeasure of this divine being you must be careful never to set your bare foot upon the ground nor spit into a fire nor throw any water upon it even tho' it were consuming a whole city  Hyde de Relig veterum Persarum  Who can express the perfections of the Almighty say the  Mahometans  Even the noblest of his works if compared to him are but dust and rubbish How much more must human conception fall short of his infinite perfections His smile and favour renders men for ever happy and to obtain it for your children the best method is to cut off from them while infants a little bit of skin about half the breadth of a farthing Take two bits of cloath  Called the Scapulaire  say the  Roman catholics  about an inch or an inch and a half square join them by the corners with two strings or pieces  of tape about sixteen inches long throw this over your head and make one of the bits of cloath lie upon your breast and the other upon your back keeping them next your skin There is not a better secret for recommending yourself to that infinite Being who exists from eternity to eternity  THE  Getes  commonly called immortal from their steddy belief of the soul's immortality were genuine theists and unitarians They affirmed  Zamolxis  their deity to be the only true god and asserted the worship of all other nations to be addressed to mere fictions and chimeras But were their religious principles any more refined on account of these magnificent pretensions Every fifth year they sacrified a human victim whom they sent as a messenger to their deity in order to inform him of their wants and necessities And when it thundered they were so provoked that in order to return the defiance they let fly arrows at him and declined not the combat as unequal Such at least is the account which  Herodotus  gives of the theism of the immortal  Getes  Lib iv    VIII  IT is remarkable that the principles of religion have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind and that men have a natural tendency to rise from idolatry to theism and to sink again from theism into idolatry The vulgar that is indeed all mankind a few excepted being ignorant and uninstructed never elevate their contemplation to the heavens or penetrate by their disquisitions into the secret structure of vegetable or animal bodies so as to discover a supreme mind or original providence which bestowed order on every part of nature They consider these admirable works in a more confined and selfish view and finding their own happiness and misery to depend on the secret influence and unforeseen concurrence of external objects they regard with perpetual attention the  unknown causes  which govern all these natural events and distribute pleasure and pain good and ill by their powerful but silent operation The unknown causes are still appealed to at every emergence and in this general appearance or confused image are the perpetual objects of human hopes and  fears wishes and apprehensions By degrees the active imagination of men uneasy in this abstract conception of objects about which it is incessantly employed begins to render them more particular and to cloathe them in shapes more suitable to its natural comprehension It represents them to be sensible intelligent beings like mankind actuated by love and hatred and flexible by gifts and entreaties by prayers and sacrifices Hence the origin of religion And hence the origin of idolatry or polytheism  BUT the same anxious concern for happiness which engenders the idea of these invisible intelligent powers allows not mankind to remain long in the first simple conception of them as powerful but limited beings masters of human fate but slaves to destiny and the course of nature Men's exaggerated praises and compliments still swell their idea upon them and elevating their deities to the utmost bounds of perfection at last beget the attributes of unity and infinity simplicity and spirituality Such refined ideas being somewhat disproportioned to vulgar comprehension remain not long in their original purity but require to be supported by the notion of inferior mediators or  subordinate agents which interpose betwixt mankind and their supreme deity These demigods or middle beings partaking more of human nature and being more familiar to us become the chief objects of devotion and gradually recal that idolatry which had been formerly banished by the ardent prayers and panegyrics of timorous and indigent mortals But as these idolatrous religions fall every day into grosser and more vulgar conceptions they at last destroy themselves and by the vile representations which they form of their deities make the tide turn again towards theism But so great is the propensity in this alternate revolution of human sentiments to return back to idolatry that the utmost precaution is not able effectually to prevent it And of this some theists particularly the  Jews  and  Mahometans  have been sensible as appears by their banishing all the arts of statuary and painting and not allowing the representations even of human figures to be taken by marble or colours lest the common infirmity of mankind should thence produce idolatry The feeble apprehensions of men cannot be satisfied with conceiving their deity as a pure spirit and perfect intelligence and yet their natural terrors keep them from  imputing to him the least shadow of limitation and imperfection They fluctuate betwixt these opposite sentiments The same infirmity still drags them downwards from an omnipotent and spiritual deity to a limited and corporeal one and from a corporeal and limited deity to a statue or visible representation The same endeavour at elevation still pushes them upwards from the statue or material image to the invisible power and from the invisible power to an infinitely perfect deity the creator and sovereign of the universe  IX  POLYTHEISM or idolatrous worship being founded entirely in vulgar traditions is liable to this great inconvenience that any practice or opinion however barbarous or corrupted may be authorized by it and full scope is left for knavery to impose on credulity till morals and humanity be expelled from the religious systems of mankind At the same time idolatry is attended with this evident advantage that by limiting the powers and functions of its deities it naturally admits the gods of other sects and nations to a share of divinity and renders all the various deities as well as rites ceremonies or traditions compatible with each other  Verrius Flaccus  cited by  Pliny  lib xxviii cap affirmed that it was usual for the  Romans  before they laid siege to any town to invocate the tutelar deity of the place and by promising him equal or greater honours than those he at present enjoyed bribe him to betray his old friends and votaries The name of the tutelar deity of  Rome  was for this reason kept a most religious mystery lest the enemies of the republic should be able in the same manner to draw him over to their service For without the name they thought nothing of that kind could be practised  Pliny  says that the common form of invocation was preserved to his time in the ritual of the pontifs And  Macrobius  has transmitted a copy of it from the secret things of  Sammonicus Serenus  Theism is opposite both in its advantages  and disadvantages As that system supposes one sole deity the perfection of reason and goodness it should if justly prosecuted banish every thing frivolous unreasonable or inhuman from religious worship and set before men the most illustrious example as well as the most commanding motives of justice and benevolence These mighty advantages are not indeed overballanced for that is not possible but somewhat diminished by inconveniencies which arise from the vices and prejudices of mankind While one sole object of devotion is acknowledged the worship of other deities is regarded as absurd and impious Nay this unity of object seems naturally to require the unity of faith and ceremonies and furnishes designing men with a pretext for representing their adversaries as prophane and the subjects of divine as well as human vengeance For as each sect is positive that its own faith and worship are entirely acceptable to the deity and as no one can conceive that the same being should be pleased with different and opposite rites and principles the several sects fall naturally into animosity  and mutually discharge on each other that sacred zeal and rancour the most furious and implacable of all human passions  THE tolerating spirit of idolaters both in antient and modern times is very obvious to any one who is the least conversant in the writings of historians or travellers When the oracle of  Delphi  was asked what rites or worship were most acceptable to the gods Those legally established in each city replied the oracle  Xenoph Memor lib ii  Even priests in those ages could it seems allow salvation to those of a different communion The  Romans  commonly adopted the gods of the conquered people and never disputed the attributes of those topical and national deities in whose territories they resided The religious wars and persecutions of the  Egyptian  idolaters are indeed an exception to this rule but are accounted for by antient authors from reasons very singular and remarkable Different species of animals were the deities of the different sects of the  Egyptians  and the deities being in continual war engaged their votaries in the same contention The worshipers of dogs could not long remain in peace with the adorers of  cats or wolves  Plutarch de Isid Osiride  And where that reason took not place the  Egyptian  superstition was not so incompatible as is commonly imagined since we learn from  Herodotus  Lib ii sub fine  that very large contributions were given by  Amasis  towards rebuilding the temple of  Delphi  THE intolerance of almost all religions which have maintained the unity of god is as remarkable as the contrary principle in polytheists The implacable narrow spirit of the  Jews  is well known  Mahometanism  set out with still more bloody principles and even to this day deals out damnation tho' not fire and faggot to all other sects And if amongst  Christians  the  English  and  Dutch  have embraced the principles of toleration this singularity has proceeded from the steddy resolution of the civil magistrate in opposition to the continued efforts of priests and bigots  THE disciples of  Zoroaster  shut the doors of heaven against all but the  Magians  Hyde de Relig vet Persarum  Nothing could more obstruct the progress of the  Persian  conquests than the furious zeal of that nation  against the temples and images of the  Greeks  And after the overthrow of that empire we find  Alexander  as a polytheist immediately reestablishing the worship of the  Babylonians  which their former princes as monotheists had carefully abolished  Arrian de Exped lib iii Id lib vii  Even the blind and devoted attachment of that conqueror to the  Greek  superstition hindered not but he himself sacrificed according to the  Babylonish  rites and ceremonies  Id ibid    So sociable is polytheism that the utmost fierceness and aversion which it meets with in an opposite religion is scarce able to disgust it and keep it at a distance  Augustus  praised extremely the reserve of his grandson  Caius Caesar  when passing by  Jerusalem  he deigned not to sacrifice according to the  Jewish  law But for what reason did  Augustus  so much approve of this conduct Only because that religion was by the pagans esteemed ignoble and barbarous  Sueton in vita Aug c    I may venture to affirm that few corruptions of idolatry and polytheism are more pernicious to political society than this corruption of  theism  Corruptio optimi pessima  when carried to the utmost height The human sacrifices of the  Carthaginians Mexicans  and many barbarous nations  Most nations have fallen into this guilt tho' perhaps that impious superstition has never prevailed very much in any civilized nation unless we except the  Carthaginians  For the  Tyrians  soon abolished it A sacrifice is conceived as a present and any present is delivered to the deity by destroying it and rendering it useless to men by burning what is solid pouring out the liquid and killing the animate For want of a better way of doing him service we do ourselves an injury and fancy that we thereby express at least the heartiness of our good will and adoration Thus our mercenary devotion deceives ourselves and imagines it deceives the deity  scarce exceed the inquisition and persecutions of  Rome  and  Madrid  For besides that the effusion of blood may not be so great in the former case as in the latter besides this I say the human victims being chosen by lot or by some exterior signs affect not in so considerable a degree the rest of the society Whereas virtue knowledge love of liberty are the qualities which call down the fatal vengeance of inquisitors and when expelled leave the society in the most shameful ignorance corruption and bondage The illegal murder of one man by a tyrant is more pernicious than the death of a thousand by pestilence famine or any undistinguishing calamity  IN the temple of  Diana  at  Aricia  near  Rome  whoever murdered the present priest was legally entitled to be installed his successor  Strabo lib v Sueton in vita Cal  A very singular institution For however barbarous and bloody the common superstitions often are to the laity they usually turn to the advantage of the holy order  X  FROM the comparison of theism and idolatry we may form some other observations which will also confirm the vulgar observation that the corruption of the best things gives rise to the worst  WHERE the deity is represented as infinitely superior to mankind this belief tho' altogether just is apt when joined with superstitious terrors to sink the human mind into the lowest submission and abasement and to represent the monkish virtues of mortification pennance humility and passive suffering as the only qualities which are acceptable to him But where the gods are conceived to be only a little superior to mankind and to have been many of them advanced from that inferior rank we are more at our ease in our addresses to them and may even without profaneness aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emulation of them Hence activity spirit courage magnanimity love of liberty and all the virtues which aggrandize a people  THE heroes in paganism correspond exactly to the saints in popery and holy dervises in  Mahometanism  The place of  Hercules Theseus Hector Romulus  is now supplied by  Dominic Francis Anthony  and  Benedict  And instead of the destruction of monsters the subduing tyrants the defence of our n  tive country celestial honours are obtained by whippings and fastings by cow rdice and humility by abject submission and slavish obedience  ONE great incitement to the pious  Alexander  in his warlike expeditions was his rivalship of  Hercules  and  Bacchus  whom he justly pretended to have excelled  Arrian passim    Brasidas  that generous and noble  Sparian  after falling in battle had heroic honours paid him by the inhabitants of  Amphipolis  whose defence he had embraced  Thucyd lib v  And in general all founders of states and colonies amongst the  Greeks  were raised to this inferior rank of divinity by those who reaped the benefit of their labours  THIS gave rise to the observation of  Machiavel  Discorsi lib vi  that the doctrines of the  Christian  religion  meaning the catholic for he knew no other which recommend only passive courage and suffering had subdued the spirit of mankind and had fitted them for slavery and subjection And this observation would certainly be just were there not many other circumstances in human society which controul the genius and character of a religion  BRASIDAS seized a mouse and being bit by it let it go  There is nothing so contemptible  says he  but what may be safe if it has but courage to defend itself  Plut Apophth    Bellarmine  patiently and humbly allowed the fleas and other odious vermin to prey upon him  We shall have heaven  says he  to reward us for our sufferings But these poor creatures have nothing but the enjoyment of the present life  Bayle Article BELLERMINE  Such difference is there betwixt the maxims of a  Greek  hero and a  Catholic  saint  XI  HERE is another observation to the same purpose and a new proof that the corruption of the best things begets the worst If we examine without prejudice the antient heathen mythology as contained in the poets we shall not discover in it any such monstrous absurdity as we may be apt at first to apprehend Where is the difficulty of conceiving that the same powers or principles whatever they were which formed this visible world men and animals produced also a species of intelligent creatures of more refined substance and greater authority than the rest That these creatures may be capricious revengeful passionate voluptuous is easily conceived nor is any circumstance more apt amongst ourselves to engender such vices than the licence of absolute authority And in short the whole mythological system is so natural that in the vast variety of planets and worlds contained in this universe it seems more than probable that somewhere or other it is really carried into execution  THE chief objection to it with regard to this planet is that it is not ascertained by any just reason or authority The antient tradition insisted on by the heathen priests and theologers is but a weak foundation and transmitted also such a number of contradictory reports supported all of them by equal authority that it became absolutely impossible to fix a preference amongst them A few volumes therefore must contain all the polemical writings of pagan priests And their whole theology must consist more of traditional stories and superstitious practices than of philosophical argument and controversy  BUT where theism forms the fundamental principle of any popular religion that tenet is so conformable to sound reason that philosophy is apt to incorporate itself with such a system of theology And if the other dogmas of that system be contained in a sacred book such as the Alcoran or be determined by any visible authority like that of the Roman pontif speculative reasoners naturally carry on their assent and embrace a theory which has been instilled into them by their earliest education and which also possesses some degree of consistence and  uniformity But as these appearances do often all of them prove deceitful philosophy will soon find herself very unequally yoaked with her new associate and instead of regulating each principle as they advance together she is at every turn perverted to serve the purposes of superstition For besides the unavoidable incoherencies which must be reconciled and adjusted one may safely affirm that all popular theology especially the scholastic has a kind of appetite for absurdity and contradiction If that theology went not beyond reason and common sense her doctrines would appear too easy and familiar Amazement must of necessity be raised Mystery affected Darkness and obscurity sought after And a foundation of merit afforded the devout votaries who desire an opportunity of subduing their rebellious reason by the belief of the most unintelligible sophisms  ECCLESIASTICAL history sufficiently confirms these reflections When a controversy is started some people pretend always with certainty to conjecture the issue Which ever opinion say they is most contrary to plain sense is sure to prevail even where the general interest of the system requires not that decision Tho' the  reproach of heresy may for some time be bandied about amongst the disputants it always rests at last on the side of reason Any one it is pretended that has but learning enough of this kind to know the definition of  Arian Pelagian Erastian Socinian Sabellian Eutychian Nestorian Monethelite  c not to mention  Protestant  whose fate is yet uncertain will be convinced of the truth of this observation And thus a system becomes more absurd in the end merely from its being reasonable and philosophical in the beginning  TO oppose the torrent of scholastic religion by such feeble maxims as these that  it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be  that  the whole is greater than a part  that  two and three make five  is pretending to stop the ocean with a bullrush Will you set up profane reason against sacred mystery No punishment is great enough for your impiety And the same fires which were kindled for heretics will serve also for the destruction of philosophers  XII  WE meet every day with people so sceptical with regard to history that they assert it impossible for any nation ever to believe such absurd principles as those of  Greek  and  Egyptian  paganism and at the same time so dogmatical with regard to religion that they think the same absurdities are to be found in no other communions  Cambyses  entertained like prejudices and very impiously ridiculed and even wounded  Apis  the great god of the  Egyptians  who appeared to his profane senses nothing but a large spotted bull But  Herodotus  Lib iii c  judiciously ascribes this sally of passion to a real madness or disorder of the brain Otherwise says the historian he would never have openly affronted any established worship For on that head continues he every nation are best satisfied with their own and think they have the advantage over every other nation  IT must be allowed that the  Roman  catholics are a very learned sect and that no one  communion but that of the church of  England  can dispute their being the most learned of all the christian churches Yet  Averroes  the famous  Arabian  who no doubt had heard of the  Egyptian  superstitions declares that of all religions the most absurd and nonsensical is that whose votaries eat after having created their deity  I BELIEVE indeed that there is no tenet in all paganism which would give so fair a scope to ridicule as this of the  real presence  For it is so absurd that it eludes the force of almost all argument There are even some pleasant stories of that kind which tho' somewhat profane are commonly told by the Catholics themselves One day a priest it is said gave inadvertently instead of the sacrament a counter which had by accident fallen among the holy wafers The communicant waited patiently for some time expecting it would dissolve on his tongue But finding that it still remained entire he took it off  I wish  cries he to the priest  you have not committed some mistake I wish you have not given me God the Father He is so hard and tough there is no swallowing him  A FAMOUS general at that time in the  Muscovite  service having come to  Paris  for the recovery of his wounds brought along with him a young  Turk  whom he had taken prisoner Some of the doctors of the  Sorbonne  who are altogether as positive as the  Dervises  of  Constantinople  thinking it a pity that the poor  Turk  should be damned for want of instruction follicited  Mustapha  very hard to turn Christian and promised him for his encouragement plenty of good wine in this world and paradise in the next These allurements were too powerful to be resisted and therefore having been well instructed and catechized he at last agreed to receive the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper The priest however to make every thing sure and solid still continued his instructions and began his catechism next day with the usual question  How many Gods are there None at all  replies  Benedict  for that was his new name  How None at all  cries the priest  To be sure  said the honest proselyte  You have told me all along that there is but one God And yesterday I eat him  SUCH are the doctrines of our brethren the Catholics But to these doctrines we are so accustomed that we never wonder at them Tho' in a future age it will probably become difficult to persuade some nations that any human twolegged creature could ever embrace such principles And it is a thousand to one but these nations themselves shall have something full as absurd in their own creed to which they will give a most implicite and most religious assent  I LODGED once at  Paris  in the same  hotel  with an ambassador from  Tunis  who having past some years at  London  was returning home that way One day I observed his  Moorish  excellency diverting himself under the porch with surveying the splendid equipages that drove along when there chanced to pass that way some  Capucin  friars who had never seen a  Turk  as he on his part tho' accustomed to the  European  dresses had never seen the grotesque figure of a  Capucin  And there is no expressing the mutual admiration with which they inspired each other Had the chaplain of the embassy entered into a dispute with these  Franciscans  their reciprocal surprize had been of the same nature And  thus all mankind stand staring at one another and there is no beating it out of their heads that the turban of the  African  is not just as good or as bad a fashion as the cowl of the  European He is a very honest man  said the prince of  Sallee  speaking of  de Ruyter It is a pity he were a Christian  HOW can you worship leeks and onions we shall suppose a  Sorbonnist  to say to a priest of  Sais  If we worship them replies the latter at least we do not at the same time eat them But what strange objects of adoration are cats and monkies says the learned doctor They are at least as good as the relicts or rotten bones of martyrs answers his no less learned antagonist Are you not mad insists the Catholic to cut one another's throat about the preference of a cabbage or a cucumber Yes says the pagan I allow it if you will confess that all those are still madder who fight about the preference among volumes of sophistry ten thousand of which are not equal in value to one cabbage or cucumber  It is strange that the  Egyptian  religion tho' so absurd should yet have borne so great a resemblance to the  Jewish  that antient writers even of the greatest genius were not able to observe any difference betwixt them For it is very remarkable that both  Tacitus  and  Suctonius  when they mention that decree of the senate under  Tiberius  by which the  Egyptian  and  Jewish  proselytes were banished from  Rome  expressly treat these religions as the same and it appears that even the decree itself was founded on that supposition  Actum de sacris  Aegyptiis Judaicisque  pellendis factumque patrum consultum ut quatuor millia libertini generis  ea superstitione  infecta quîs idonea aetas in insulam Sardiniam veherentur coercendis illic latrociniis si ob gravitatem coeli interissent  vile damnum  Ceteri cederent Italia nisi certam ante diem profanos ritus exuissent Tacit Ann  lib ii c  Externas caeremonias  Aegyptios Judaicosque  ritus compescuit coactis qui  superstitione ea  tenebantur religiosas vestes cum instrumento omni comburere c Sueton Tiber  c These wise heathens observing something in the general air and genius and spirit of the two religions to be the same esteemed the differences of their dogmas too frivolous to deserve any attention    EVERY bystander will easily judge but unfortunately the bystanders are very few that if nothing were requisite to establish any popular system but the exposing the absurdities of other systems every votary of every superstition could give a sufficient reason for his blind and bigotted attachment to the principles in which he has been educated But without so extensive a knowledge on which to ground this assurance and perhaps better without it there is not wanting a sufficient stock of religious zeal and faith amongst mankind  Diodorus Siculus  Lib i  gives  a remarkable instance to this purpose of which he was himself an eyewitness While  Egypt  lay under the greatest terror of the  Roman  name a legionary soldier having inadvertently been guilty of the sacrilegious impiety of killing a cat the whole people rose upon him with the utmost fury and all the efforts of their prince were not able to save him The senate and people of  Rome  I am persuaded would not then have been so delicate with regard to their national deities They very frankly a little after that time voted  Augustus  a place in the celestial mansions and would have dethroned every god in heaven for his sake had he seemed to desire it  Praesens divus habebitur Augustus  says  Horace  That is a very important point And in other nations and other ages the same circumstance has not been esteemed altogether indifferent  When  Louis  the XIVth took on himself the protection of the Jesu  tes college of  Clermont  the society ordered the king's arms to be put up over their gate and took down the cross in order to make way for it Which gave occasion to the following epigram  Suistlit hinc Christi posuitque insignia Regis  Impia gens alium nescit habere Deum    NOT WITHSTANDING the sanctity of our holy religion says  Tully  De nat Deor l i  no crime is more  common with us than sacrilege But was it ever heard that an  Egyptian  violated the temple of a cat an ibis or a crocodile There is no torture an  Egyptian  would not undergo says the same author in another place  Tusc Quaest lib v  rather than injure an ibis an aspie a cat a dog or a crocodile Thus it is strictly true what  Dryden  observes  "Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be  "Stock stone or other homely pedigree  "In his desence his servants are as bold  "As if he had been born of beaten gold"  ABSALOM and ACHITOPHEL  Nay the baser the materials are of which the divinity is composed the greater devotion is he likely to excite in the breasts of his deluded votaries They exult in their shame and make a merit with their deity in braving for his sake all the ridicule and contumely of his enemies Ten thousand  Croises  inlist themselves under the holy banners and even openly triumph in th  se parts of their religion which their adversarie  regard as the most reproachful  THERE occur▪ I own a difficulty in the  Egyptian  system of theology as indeed few  systems are entirely free from difficulties It is evident from their method of propagation that a couple of cats in fifty years would stock a whole kingdom and if that religious veneration were still paid them it would in twenty more not only be easier in  Egypt  to find a god than a man which  Petronius  says was the case in some parts of  Italy  but the gods must at last entirely starve the men and leave themselves neither priests nor votaries remaining It is probable therefore that that wise nation the most celebrated in antiquity for prudence and sound policy foreseeing such dangerous consequences reserved all their worship for the fullgrown divinities and used the freedom to drown the holy spawn or little sucking gods without any scruple or remorse And thus the practice of warping the tenets of religion in order to serve temporal interests is not by any means to be regarded as an invention of these latter ages  THE learned philosophical  Varro  discoursing of religion pretends not to deliver any thing beyond probabilities and appearances Such was his good sense and moderation But the passionate the zealous  Augustin  insults the noble  Roman  on his scepticism and reserve and professes  the most thorough belief and assurance  De civitate Dei l iii c  A heathen poet however contemporary with the saint absurdly esteems the religious system of the latter so false that even the credulity of children he says could not engage them to believe it  Claudii Rutilii Numitiani iter lib i l    Is it strange when mistakes are so common to find every one positive and dogmatical And that the zeal often rises in proportion to the error  Moverunt  says  Spartian ea tempestate Judaei bellum quod vetabantur mutilare genitalia  In vita Adriani    IF ever there was a nation or a time in which the public religion lost all authority over mankind we might expect that infidelity in  Rome  during the  Ciceronian  age would openly have erected its throne and that  Cicero  himself in every speech and action would have been its most declared abettor But it appears that whatever sceptical liberties that great man might use in his writings or in philosophical conversation he yet avoided in the common conduct of life the imputation of deism and profaneness Even in his own family and to his wife  Terentia  whom he highly trusted he  was willing to appear a devout religionist and there remains a letter addrest to her in which he seriously desires her to offer sacrifice to  Apollo  and  Aesculapius  in gratitude for the recovery of his health  Lib xiv epist    POMPEY'S devotion was much more sincere In all his conduct during the civil wars he paid a great regard to auguries dreams and prophesies  Cicero de Divin lib ii c    Augustus  was tainted with superstition of every kind As it is reported of  Milton  that his poetical genius never flowed with ease and abundance in the spring so  Augustus  observed that his own genius for dreaming never was so perfect during that season nor was so much to be relied on as during the rest of the year That great and able emperor was also extremely uneasy when he happened to change his shoes and put the right foot shoe on the left foot  Sueton Aug cap Plin lib ii cap  In short it cannot be doubted but the votaries of the established superstition of antiquity were as numerous in every state as those of the modern religion are at present Its influence was as universal tho' it was not so  great As many people gave their assent to it tho' that assent was not seemingly so strong precise and affirmative  WE may observe that notwithstanding the dogmatical imperious style of all superstition the conviction of the religionists in all ages is more affected than real and scarce ever approaches in any degree to that solid belief and persuasion which governs us in the common affairs of life Men dare not avow even to their own hearts the doubts which they entertain on such subjects They make a merit of implicite faith and disguise to themselves their real infidelity by the strongest asseverations and most positive bigotry But nature is too hard for all their endeavours and suffers not the obscure glimmering light afforded in those shadowy regions to equal the strong impressions made by common sense and by experience The usual course of men's conduct belies their words and shows that the assent in these matters is some unaccountable operation of the mind betwixt disbelief and conviction but approaching much nearer the former than the latter  SINCE therefore the mind of man appears of so loose and unsteddy a contexture that even at present when so many persons find an interest in continually employing on it the chissel and the hammer yet are they not able to engrave theological tenets with any lasting impression how much more must this have been the case in antient times when the retainers to the holy function were so much fewer in comparison No wonder that the appearances were then very inconsistent and that men on some occasions might seem determined infidels and enemies to the established religion without being so in reality or at least without knowing their own minds in that particular  ANOTHER cause which rendered the antient religions much looser than the modern is that the former were  traditional  and the latter are  scriptural  and the tradition in the former was complex contradictory and on many occasions doubtful so that it could not possibly be reduced to any standard and canon or afford any determinate articles of faith The stories of the gods were numberless like the popish legends and tho' every one almost believed a part of these stories yet no one could believe or know  the whole While at the same time all must have acknowledged that no one part stood on a better foundation than the rest The traditions of different cities and nations were also on many occasions directly opposite and no reason could be found for preferring one to the other And as there was an infinite number of stories with regard to which tradition was no way positive the gradation was insensible from the most fundamental articles of faith to those loose and precarious fictions The pagan religion therefore seemed to vanish like a cloud whenever one approached to it and examined it piecemeal It could never be ascertained by any fixt dogmas and principles And tho' this did not convert the generality of mankind from so absurd a faith for when will the people be reasonable yet it made them faulter and hesitate more in maintaining their principles and was even apt to produce in certain dispositions of mind some practices and opinions which had the appearance of determined infidelity  To which we may add that the fables of the pagan religion were of themselves light easy and familiar without devils or seas of brimstone or any objects that could much terrify  the imagination Who could forbear smiling when he thought of the loves of  Mars  and  Venus  or the amorous frolics of  Jupiter  and  Pan  In this respect it was a true poetical religion if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry We find that it has been adopted by modern bards nor have these talked with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods whom they regarded as fictions than the antient did of the real objects of their devotion  THE inference is by no means just that because a system of religion has made no deep impression on the minds of a people it must therefore have been positively rejected by all men of common sense and that opposite principles in spite of the prejudices of education were generally established by argument and reasoning I know not but a contrary inference may be more probable The less importunate and assuming any species of superstition appears the less will it provoke men's spleen and indignation or engage them into enquiries concerning its foundation and origin This in the mean time is obvious that the empire of all religious faith over the understanding is wavering and  uncertain subject to all varieties of humour and dependent on the present incidents which strike the imagination The difference is only in the degrees An antient will place a stroke of impiety and one of superstition alternately thro' a whole discourse  Witness this remarkable passage of  Tacitus Praeter multiplices rerum bumanarum casus coelo terraque prodigia fulminum monitus futurorum praesagia laeta tristia ambigua manifesta Nec enim umquam atrocioribus populi Romani cladibus magisque justis judiciis approbatum est non esse curae Diis securitatem nostram esse ultionem Hist  lib i  Augustus's  quarrel with  Neptune  is an instance of the same kind Had not the emperor believed  Neptune  to be a real being and to have dominion over the sea where had been the foundation of his anger And if he believed it what madness to provoke still farther that deity The same observation may be made upon  Quinctilian's  exclamations on account of the death of his children lib vi Praef  A modern often thinks in the same way tho' he may be more guarded in his expressions  LUCIAN tells us expressly  Philopseudes  that whoever believed not the most ridiculous fables of paganism was esteemed by the people profane and impious To what purpose indeed would that agreeable author have employed the whole force of his wit and satyr against the national religion had not that religion been generally believed by his countrymen and contemporaries  LIVY  Lib x cap  acknowledges as frankly as any divine would at present the common incredulity of his age but then he condemns it as severely And who can imagine that a national superstition which could delude so great a man would not also impose on the generality of the people  THE  Stoics  bestowed many magnificent and even impious epithets on their sage that he alone was rich free a king and equal to the immortal gods They forgot to add that he was not inferior in prudence and understanding to an old woman For surely nothing can be more pitiful than the sentiments which that sect entertained with regard to all popular superstitions while they very seriously agree with the common augurs that when a raven croaks from the left it is a good omen but a bad one when a rook makes a noise from the same quarter  Panaetius  was the only  Stoic  amongst the  Greeks  who so much as doubted with regard to auguries and divinations  Cicero de Divin lib i cap    Marcus Antoninus  Lib i §  tells us that he himself had received many admonitions from the gods in his sleep It is true  Epictetus  Ench §  forbids us to regard the  language of rooks and revens but it is not that they do not speak truth It is only because they can fortel nothing but the breaking of our neck or the forfeiture of our estate which are circumstances says he that no way concern us Thus the  Stoics  join a philosophical enthusiasm to a religious superstition The force of their mind being all turned to the side of morals unbent itself in that of religion  The  Stoics  I own were not quite orthodox in the established religion but one may see from these instances that they went a great way And the people undoubtedly went every length    PLATO  Eutyphro  introduces  Socrates  affirming that the accusation of impiety raised against him was owing entirely to his rejecting such fables as those of  Saturn's  castrating his father  Uranus  and  Jupiter's  dethroning  Saturn  Yet in a subsequent dialogue  Phaedo    Socrates  confesses that the doctrine of the mortality of the soul was the received opinion of the people Is there here any contradiction Yes surely But the contradiction is not in  Plato  it is in the people whose religious principles in general are always composed of the most discordant parts especially in an  age when superstition sate so easy and light upon them  Xenophon's  conduct as related by himself is at once an incontestable proof of the general credulity of mankind in those ages and the incoherencies in all ages of men's opinions in religious matters That great captain and philosopher the disciple of  Socrates  and one who has delivered some of the most refined sentiments with regard to a deity gave all the following marks of vulgar pagan superstition By  Socrates's  advice he consulted the oracle of  Delphi  before he would engage in the expedition of  Cyrus  De exped lib iii p ex edit Leunel Sees a dream the night after the generals were seized which he pays great regard to but thinks ambiguous Id p He and the whole army regard sneezing as a very lucky omen Id p Has another dream when he comes to the river  Centrites  which his fellow general  C  rosophus  also pays great regard to Id lib iv p The  Greeks  suffering from a cold north wind sacrifice to it and the historian observes that it immediately abated Id p  Xenophon  consults the sacrifices in secret before he would form any resolution with himself about settling a colony Lib v p He himself a very skilful augur Id p Is determined by the victims to refuse the sole command of the army which was offered him Lib vi p  Cleander  the  Spartan  tho' very desirous of it refuses it for the same reason Id p  Xenophon  mentions an old dream with the interpretation given him when he first joined  Cyrus  P Mentions also the place of  Hercules's  descent into hell as believing it and says the marks of it are still remaining Id p Had almost starved the army rather than lead to the field against the auspices Id p His friend  Euclides  the augur would not believe that he had brought no money from the expedition till he  Euclides  sacrificed and then he saw the matter clearly in the  Exta  Lib vii p The same philosopher proposing a project of mines for the encrease of the  Athenian  revenues advises them first to consult the oracle De rat red p That all this devotion was not a farce in order to serve a political purpose appears both from the facts themselves and from the genius of that age when little or nothing could be gained by hypocrisy Besides  Xenophon  as appears from his  Memorabilia  was a kind of heretic in those times which no political devotee ever is It is for the same reason I maintain that  Newton Locke Clarke  c being  Arians  or  Socinians  were very sincere in the creed they profest And I always oppose this argument to some libertines who will needs have it that it was impossible but that these great philosophers must have been hypocrites    THE same  Cicero  who affected in his own family to appear a devout religionist makes no scruple in a public court of judicature of treating the doctrine of a future state as a most ridiculous fable to which no body could give any attention  Pro Cluentio cap    Sallust  De bello Catilin  represents  Caesar  as speaking the same language in the open senate  Cicero  Tusc Quaest lib i cap and  Seneca  Epist as also  Juvenal  Satyr maintain that there is no boy or old woman so ridiculous as to believe the poets in their accounts of a future state Why then does  Lucretius  so highly exalt his master for freeing us from these terrors Perhaps the generality of mankind were then in the disposition of  Cephalus  in  Plato  de Rep lib i who while he was young and healthful could ridicule these stories but as soon as he became old and infirm began to entertain apprehensions of their truth This we may observe not to be unusual even at present    BUT that all these freedoms implied not a total and universal infidelity and scepticism  amongst the people is too apparent to be denied Tho' some parts of the national religion hung loose upon the minds of men other parts adhered more closely to them And it was the great business of the sceptical philosophers to show that there was no more foundation for one than for the other This is the artifice of  Cotta  in the dialogues concerning  the nature of the gods  He refutes the whole system of mythology by leading the orthodox gradually from the more momentous stories which were believed to the more frivolous which every one ridiculed From the gods to the goddesses from the goddesses to the nymphs from the nymphs to the fawns and satyrs His master  Carneades  had employed the same method of reasoning  Sext Empir advers Mathem lib viii    UPON the whole the greatest and most observable differences betwixt a  traditional mythological  religion and a  systematical scholastic  one are two The former is often more reasonable as consisting only of a multitude of stories which however groundless imply no express absurdity and demonstrative contradiction  and sits also so easy and light on men's minds that tho' it may be as universally received it makes no such deep impression on the affections and understanding  XIII  THE primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible unknown powers while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind may easily be conceived Every image of vengeance severity cruelty and malice must occur and augment the ghastliness and horror which oppresses the amazed religionist A panic having once seized the mind the active fancy still farther multiplies the objects of terror while that profound darkness or what is worse that glimmering light with which we are invironed represents the spectres of divinity under the most dreadful appearances imaginable And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed which those terrified devotees do not readily without scruple apply to their deity  THIS appears the natural state of religion when surveyed in one light But if we consider on the other hand that spirit of praise and eulogy which necessarily has place in all religions and which is the consequence of these very  terrors we must expect a quite contrary system of theology to prevail Every virtue every excellence must be ascribed to the divinity and no exaggeration be esteemed sufficient to reach those perfections with which he is endowed Whatever strains of panegyric can be invented are immediately embraced without consulting any arguments or phaenomena And it is esteemed a sufficient confirmation of them that they give us more magnificent ideas of the divine object of our worship and adoration  HERE therefore is a kind of contradiction betwixt the different principles of human nature which enter into religion Our natural terrors present the notion of a devilish and malicious deity Our propensity to praise leads us to acknowledge an excellent and divine And the influence of these opposite principles are various according to the different situation of the human understanding  IN very barbarous and ignorant nations such as the  Africans and Indians  nay even the  Japonese  who can form no extensive ideas of power and knowledge worship may be paid to a being whom they confess to be wicked and detestable  tho' they may be cautious perhaps of pronouncing this judgment of him in public or in his temple where he may be supposed to hear their reproaches  SUCH rude imperfect ideas of the divinity adhere long to all idolaters and it may safely be affirmed that the  Greeks  themselves never got entirely rid of them It is remarked by  Xenophon  Mem lib i  in praise of  Socrates  that that philosopher assented not to the vulgar opinion which supposed the gods to know some things and be ignorant of others He maintained that they knew every thing what was done said or even thought But as this was a strain of philosophy  It was considered among the antients as a very extraordinary philosophical paradox that the presence of the gods was not confined to the heavens but was extended every where as we learn from  Lucian Hermotimus sive De sectis  much above the conception of his countrymen we need not be surprized if very frankly in their books and conversation they blamed the deities whom they worshiped in their temples It is observable that  Herodotus  in particular scruples not in many passages to ascribe  envy  to the gods a sentiment of all  others the most suitable to a mean and devilish nature The pagan hymns however sung in public worship contained nothing but epithets of praise even while the actions ascribed to the gods were the most barbarous and detestable When  Timotheus  the poet recited a hymn to  Diana  where he enumerated with the greatest eulogies all the actions and attributes of that cruel capricious goddess  May your daughter  said one present  become such as the deity whom you celebrate  Plutarch de Superst    BUT as men farther exalt their idea of their divinity it is often their notion of his power and knowledge only not of his goodness which is improved On the contrary in proportion to the supposed extent of his science and authority their terrors naturally augment while they believe that no secrecy can conceal them from his scrutiny and that even the inmost recesses of their breast lie open before him They must then be careful not to form expressly any sentiment of blame and disapprobation All must be applause ravishment extacy And while their gloomy apprehensions make them  ascribe to him measures of conduct which in human creatures would be highly blamed they must still affect to praise and admire these measures in the object of their devotional addresses And thus it may safely be affirmed that many popular religions are really in the conception of their more vulgar votaries a species of daemonism and the higher the deity is exalted in power and knowledge the lower of course is he frequently deprest in goodness and benevolence whatever epithets of praise may be bestowed on him by his amazed adorers Amongst idolaters the words may be false and belie the secret opinion But amongst more exalted religionists the opinion itself often contracts a kind of falshood and belies the inward sentiment The heart secretly detests such measures of cruel and implacable vengeance but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable And the additional misery of this inward struggle aggravates all the other terrors by which these unhappy victims to superstition are for ever haunted  LUCIAN  Necyomantia  observes that a young man who reads the history of the gods in  Homer  or  Hesiod  and finds their factions wars injustice incest adultery and other immoralities so highly celebrated is much surprized afterwards when he comes into the world to observe that punishments are by law inflicted on the same actions which he had been taught to ascribe to superior beings The contradiction is still perhaps stronger betwixt the representations given us by some latter religions and our natural ideas of generosity lenity impartiality and justice and in proportion to the multiplied terrors of these religions the barbarous conceptions of the divinity are multiplied upon us  Bacchus  a divine being is represented by the heathen mythology as the inventor of dancing and the theatre Plays were antiently even a part of public worship on the most solemn occasions and often employed in times of pestilence to appease the offended deities But they have been zealously proscribed by the godly in latter ages and the playhouse according to a learned divine is the porch of hell  But in order to show more evidently that it is possible for a religion to represent the divinity in still a more immoral unamiable light than the antient we shall cite a long passage from an author of taste and imagination who was surely no enemy to Christianity It is the chevalier  Ramsay  a writer who had so laudable an inclination to be orthodox that his reason never found any difficulty even in the doctrines which freethinkers scruple the most the trinity incarnation and satisfaction His humanity alone of which he seems to have had a great stock rebelled against the doctrines of eternal reprobation and predestination He expresses himself thus  'What strange ideas says he would an Indian or a Chinese philosopher have of our holy religion if they judged by the schemes given of it by our modern freethinkers and pharisaical doctors of all sects According to the odious and too  vulgar  system of these incredulous scoffers and credulous scriblers  "The God of the Jews is a most cruel unjust partial and fantastical being He created about years ago a man and a woman and placed them in a fine garden of Asia of which there are no remains This garden was furnished with all sorts of trees fountains and flowers He allowed them the use of all the fruits of this beautiful garden except of one that was planted in the midst thereof and that had in it a secret virtue of preserving them in continual health and vigor of body and mind of exalting their natural powers and making them wise The devil entered into the body of a serpent and solicited the first woman to eat of this forbidden fruit she engaged her husband to do the same To punish this slight curiosity and natural desire of life and knowledge God not only threw our first parents out of paradise but he condemned all their posterity to temporal misery and the greatest part of them to eternal pains tho' the souls of these innocent children have no more relation to that of Adam than to those of Nero and Mahomet since according to the scholastic drivellers fabulists and mythologists all souls are created pure and infused immediately into mortal bodies so soon as the foetus is formed To accomplish the barbarous partial decree of predestination and reprobation God abandoned all nations to darkness idolatry and superstition without any saving knowledge or salutary graces unless it was one particular nation whom he chose as his peculiar people This chosen nation was however the most stupid ungrateful rebellious and perfidious of all nations After God had thus kept the far greater part of all the human species during near years in a reprobate state he changed all of a sudden and took a fancy for other nations beside the Jews Then he sent his only begotten Son to the world under a human form to appease his wrath satisfy his vindictive justice and die for the pardon of sin Very few nations however have heard of this gospel and all the rest tho' left in invincible ignorance are damned without exception or any possibility of remission The greatest part of those who have heard of it have changed only some speculative notions about God and some external forms in worship For in other respects the bulk of Christians have continued as corrupt as the rest of mankind in their morals yea so much the more perverse and criminal that their lights were greater Unless it be a very small select number all other Christians like the pagans will be for ever damned the great sacrifice offered up for them will become void and of no effect God will take delight for ever in their torments and blasphemies and tho' he can by one  fiat  change their hearts yet they will remain for ever unconverted and unconvertible because he will be for ever unappeaseable and irreconcileable It is true that all this makes God odious a hater of souls rather than a lover of them a cruel vindictive tyrant an impotent or a wrathful daemon rather than an allpowerful beneficent Father of spirits Yet all this is a mystery He has secret reasons for his conduct that are impenetrable and tho' he appears unjust and barbarous yet we must believe the contrary because what is injustice crime cruelty and the blackest malice in us is in him justice mercy and sovereign goodness"  Thus the incredulous freethinkers the judaizing Christians and the fatalistic doctors have disfigured and dishonoured the sublime mysteries of our holy faith thus they have confounded the nature of good and evil transformed the most monstrous passions into divine attributes and surpassed the pagans in blasphemy by ascribing to the eternal nature as perfections what makes the most horrid crimes amongst men The grosser pagans contented themselves with divinizing lust incest and adultry but the predestinarian doctors have divinized cruelty wrath fury vengeance and all the blackest vices'  See the chevalier Ramsay's philosophical principles of natural and revealed religion Part II p  The same author asserts in other places that the  Arminian  and  Molinist  schemes serve very little to mend the matter And having thus thrown himself out of all received sects of Christianity he is obliged to advance a system of his own which is a kind of  Origenism  and supposes the preexistence of the souls both of men and beasts and the eternal salvation and conversion of all men beasts and devils But this notion being quite peculiar to himself we need not treat of I thought the opinions of this ingenious author very curious but I pretend not to warrant the justness of them  Nothing can  preserve untainted the genuine principles of morals in our judgment of human conduct  but the absolute necessity of these principles to the existence of society If common conception  can indulge princes in a system of ethics somewhat different from that which should regulate private persons how much more those superior beings whose attributes views and nature are so totally unknown to us  Sunt superis sua jura  Ovid Metam lib ix  The gods have maxims of justice peculiar to themselves  XIV  HERE I cannot forbear observing a fact which may be worth the attention of those who make human nature the object of their enquiry It is certain that in every religion however sublime the verbal definition which it gives of its divinity many of the votaries perhaps the greatest number will still seek the divine favour not by virtue and good morals which alone can be acceptable to a perfect being but either by frivolous observances by intemperate zeal by rapturous extasies or by the belief of mysterious and absurd opinions The least part of the  Sadder  as well as of the  Pentateuch  consists in precepts of morality and we may be assured that that part was always the least observed and regarded When the old  Romans  were attacked with a pestilence they never ascribed their sufferings to their vices or dreamed of repentance and amendment They never thought that they were the general robbers of the world whose ambition and avarice made desolate the earth and reduced opulent nations to want and beggary They only created a dictator  Called Dictator clavis figendae causa T Livii l vii c  in  order to drive a nail into a door and by that means they thought that they had sufficiently appeased their incensed deity  IN  Aegina  one faction entering into a conspiracy barbarously and treacherously assassinated seven hundred of their fellowcitizens and carried their fury so far that one miserable fugitive having fled to the temple they cut off his hands by which he clung to the gates and carrying him out of holy ground immediately murdered him  By this impiety  says  Herodotus  Lib vi  not by the other many cruel assassinations  they offended the gods and contracted an inexpiable guilt  NAY if we should suppose what seldom happens that a popular religion were found in which it was expressly declared that nothing but morality could gain the divine favour if an order of priests were instituted to inculcate this opinion in daily sermons and with all the arts of persuasion yet so inveterate are the people's prejudices that for want of some other superstition they would make the very attendance on these sermons the essentials of religion rather  than place them in virtue and good morals The sublime prologue of  Zaleucus's  laws  To be found in Diod Sic lib xii  inspired not the  Locrians  so far as we can learn with any sounder notions of the measures of acceptance with the deity than were familiar to the other  Greeks  THIS observation then holds universally But still one may be at some loss to account for it It is not sufficient to observe that the people every where degrade their deities into a similitude with themselves and consider them merely as a species of human creatures somewhat more potent and intelligent This will not remove the difficulty For there is no  man  so stupid as that judging by his natural reason he would not esteem virtue and honesty the most valuable qualities which any person could possess Why not ascribe the same sentiment to his deity Why not make all religion or the chief part of it to consist in these attainments  NOR is it satisfactory to say that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of superstition and is therefore rejected For  not to mention the excessive pennances of the  Brahmans  and  Talapoins  it is certain that the  Rhamadan  of the  Turks  during which the poor wretches for many days often in the hottest months of the year and in some of the hottest climates of the world remain without eating or drinking from the rising to the setting of the sun this  Rhamadan  I say must be more severe than the practice of any moral duty even to the most vicious and depraved of mankind The four lents of the  Muscovites  and the austerities of some  Roman Catholics  appear more disagreable than meekness and benevolence In short all virtue when men are reconciled to it by ever so little practice is agreeable All superstition is for ever odious and burthensome  PERHAPS the following account may be received as a true solution of the difficulty The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent seem merely owing to his benefactor or children nor can he be wanting to these duties without breaking thro' all the ties of nature and morality A strong inclination may prompt him to the performance A sentiment of order and moral beauty joins its force to these natural tyes And the whole man if truly virtuous  is drawn to his duty without any effort or endeavour Even with regard to the virtues which are more austere and more founded on reflection such as public spirit filial duty temperance or integrity the moral obligation in our apprehension removes all pretence to religious merit and the virtuous conduct is esteemed no more than what we owe to society and to ourselves In all this a superstitious man finds nothing which he has properly performed for the sake of his deity or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favour and protection He considers not that the most genuine method of serving the divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures He still looks out for some more immediate service of the supreme being in order to allay those terrors with which he is haunted And any practice recommended to him which either serves to no purpose in life or offers the strongest violence to his natural inclinations that practice he will the more readily embrace on account of those very circumstances which should make him absolutely reject it It seems the more purely religious that it proceeds from no mixture of any other motive or consideration And if for its sake he sacrifices much  of his ease and quiet his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers In restoring a loan or paying a debt his divinity is no way beholden to him because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform and what many would have performed were there no god in the universe But if he fast a day or give himself a sound whipping this has a direct reference in his opinion to the service of God No other motive could engage him to such austerities By these distinguished marks of devotion he has now acquired the divine favour and may expect in recompence protection and safety in this world and eternal happiness in the next  HENCE the greatest crimes have been found in many instances compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any certain inference in favour of a man's mora's from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises even tho' he himself believe them sincere Nay it has been observed that enormities of the blackest dye have been rather apt to produce superstitious terrors and encrease the religious passion  Bomilcar  having formed a conspiracy for assassinating at once the whole senate of  Carthage  and invading the liberties of his country lost the opportunity from a continual regard to omens and prophesies  Those who undertake the most criminal and most dangerous enterprizes are commonly the most superstitious  as an antient historian  Diod Sic lib xx  remarks on this occasion Their devotion and spiritual faith rise with their fears  Catiline  was not contented with the established deities and received rites of his national religion His anxious terrors made him seek new inventions of this kind  Cic Catil i Sallust de bello Catil  which he never probably had dreamed of had he remained a good citizen and obedient to the laws of his country  TO which we may add that even after the commission of crimes there arise remorses and secret horrors which give no rest to the mind but make it have recourse to religious rites and ceremonies as expiations of its offences Whatever weakens or disorders the internal frame promotes the interests of superstition And nothing is more destructive to them than a manly  steddy virtue which either preserves us from disastrous melancholy accidents or teaches us to bear them During such calm sunshine of the mind these spectres of false divinity never make their appearance On the other hand while we abandon ourselves to the natural undisciplined suggestions of our timid and anxious hearts every kind of barbarity is ascribed to the supreme being from the terrors with which we are agitated and every kind of caprice from the methods which we embrace in order to appease him  Barbarity caprice  these qualities however nominally disguised we may universally observe to form the ruling character of the deity in popular religions Even priests instead of correcting these depraved ideas of mankind have often been found ready to foster and encourage them The more tremendous the divinity is represented the more tame and submissive do men become to his ministers And the more unaccountable the measures of acceptance required by him the more necessary does it become to abandon our natural reason and yield to their ghostly guidance and direction And thus it may be allowed that the artifices of men aggravate our natural infirmities  and follies of this kind but never originally beget them Their root strikes deeper into the mind and springs from the essential and universal properties of human nature  XV  THO' the stupidity of men barbarous and uninstructed be so great that they may not see a sovereign author in the more obvious works of nature to which they are so much familiarized yet it scarce seems possible that any one of good understanding should reject that idea when once it is suggested to him A purpose an intention a design is evident in every thing and when our comprehension is so far enlarged as to contemplate the first rise of this visible system we must adopt with the strongest conviction the idea of some intelligent cause or author The uniform maxims too which prevail thro' the whole frame of the universe naturally if not necessarily lead us to conceive this intelligence as single and undivided where the prejudices of education oppose not so reasonable a theory Even the contrarieties of nature by discovering themselves every where become proofs of some consistent plan and establish one single purpose or intention however inexplicable and incomprehensible  GOOD and ill are universally intermingled and confounded happiness and misery wisdom and folly virtue and vice Nothing is pure and entirely of a piece All advantages are attended with disadvantages An universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence And it is scarce possible for us by our most chimerical wishes to form the idea of a station or situation altogether desirable The draughts of life according to the poet's fiction are always mixed from the vessels on each hand of  Jupiter  Or if any cup be presented altogether pure it is drawn only as the same poet tells us from the lefthanded vessel  THE more exquisite any good is of which a small specimen is afforded us the sharper is the evil allied to it and few exceptions are  ound to this uniform law of nature The most sprightly wit borders on madness the highest effusions of joy produce the deepest melancholy the most ravishing pleasures are attended with the most cruel lassitude and disgust the most flattering hopes make way for the severest disappointments And in general no course of life has such safety for happiness is not to be dreamed of as the temperate and moderate  which maintains as far as possible a mediocrity and a kind of insensibility in every thing  AS the good the great the sublime the ravishing are found eminently in the genuine principles of theism it may be expected from the analogy of nature that the base the absurd the mean the terrifying will be discovered equally in religious fictions and chimeras  THE universal propensity to believe in invisible intelligent power if not an original instinct being at least a general attendant of human nature it may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp which the divine workman has set upon his work and nothing surely can more dignify mankind than to be thus selected from all the other parts of the creation and to bear the image or impression of the universal Create But consult this image as it commonly appears in the popular religions of the world How is the deity disfigured in our representations of him What caprice absurdity and immorality are attributed to him How much is he degraded even below the character which we should naturally in common life ascribe to a man of sense virtue  WHAT a noble privilege is it of human reason to attain the knowledge of the supreme being and from the visible works of nature be enabled to infer so sublime a principle as its supreme Creator But turn the reverse of the medal Survey most nations and most ages Examine the religious principles which have in fact prevailed in the world You will scarcely be persuaded that they are other than sick men's dreams Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkeys in human shape than the serious positive dogmatical asseverations of a being who dignifies himself with the name of rational  HEAR the verbal protestations of all men Nothing they are so certain of as their religious tenets Examine their lives You will scarcely think that they repose the smallest confidence in them  THE greatest and truest zeal gives us no security against hypocrisy The most open impiety is attended with a secret dread and compunction  NO theological absurdities so glaring as have not sometimes been embraced by men of the greatest and most cultivated understanding No religious precepts so rigorous as have not been adopted by the most voluptuous and most abandoned of men  IGNORANCE  is the mother of Devotion  A maxim that is proverbial and confirmed by general experience Look out for a people entirely devoid of religion If you find them at all be assured that they are but few degrees removed from brutes  WHAT so pure as some of the morals included in some theological systems What so corrupted as some of the practices to which these systems give rise  THE comfortable views exhibited by the belief of futurity are ravishing and delightful But how quickly vanish on the appearance of its terrors which keep a more firm and durable possession of the human mind  THE whole is a riddle an aenigma an inexplicable mystery Doubt uncertainty suspence  of judgment appear the only result of our most accurate scrutiny concerning this subject But such is the frailty of human reason and such the irresistible contagion of opinion that even this deliberate doubt could scarce be upheld did we not enlarge our view and opposing one species of superstition to another set them a quarreling while we ourselves during their fury and contention happily make our escape into the calm tho' obscure regions of philosophy  DISSERTATION II OF THE PASSIONS  DISSERTATION II Of the Passions  SECT I  SOME objects produce immediately an agreeable sensation by the original structure of our organs and are thence denominated GOOD as others from their immediate disagreeable sensation acquire the appellation of EVIL Thus moderate warmth is agreeable and good excessive heat painful and evil  SOME objects again by being naturally conformable or contrary to passion excite an agreeable or painful sensation and are thence called  Good  or  Evil  The punis  ent of an adversary by gratifying revenge is good the sickness of a companion by affecting friendship is evil  ALL good or evil whenceever it arises produces various passions and affections according to the light in which it is surveyed  WHEN good is certain or very probable it produces JOY When evil is in the same situation there arises GRIEF or SORROW  WHEN either good or evil is uncertain it gives rise to FEAR or HOPE according to the degrees of uncertainty on one side or the other  DESIRE arises from good considered simply and AVERSION from evil The WILL exerts itself when either the presence of the good or absence of the evil may be attained by any action of the mind or body  NONE of these passions seem to contain any thing curious or remarkable except  Hope  and  Fear  which being derived from the probability of any good or evil are mixt passions that merit our attention  PROBABILITY arises from an opposition of contrary chances or causes by which the mind is not allowed to fix on either side but is incessantly tost from one to another and in one moment is determined to consider an object as existent and in another moment as the contrary The imagination or understanding call it which you please fluctuates betwixt the opposite views and tho' perhaps it may be oftener turned to one side than the other it is impossible for it by reason of the opposition of causes or chances to rest on either The  pro  and  con  of the question alternately prevail and the mind surveying the objects in their opposite causes finds such a contrariety as utterly destroys all certainty or established opinion  SUPPOSE then that the object concerning which we are doubtful produces either desire or aversion it is evident that according as the mind turns itself to one side or the other it must feel a momentary impression of joy or sorrow An object whose existence we desire gives satisfaction when we think of those causes which produce it and for the same reason excites grief or uneasiness from the opposite consideration So that as the understanding  in probable questions is divided betwixt the contrary points of view the heart must in the same manner be divided betwixt opposite emotions  NOW if we consider the human mind we shall observe that with regard to the passions it is not like a windinstrument of music which in running over all the notes immediately loses the sound when the breath ceases but rather resembles a stringinstrument where after each stroke the vibrations still retain some sound which gradually and insensibly decays The imagination is extremely quick and agile but the passions in comparison are slow and restive For which reason when any object is presented which affords a variety of views to the one and emotions to the other tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the other According as the probability inclines to good or evil the passion of grief or joy predominates in the composition and these passions being intermingled by means of the  contrary views of the imagination produce by the union the passions of hope or fear  AS this theory seems to carry its own evidence along with it we shall be more concise in our proofs  THE passions of fear and hope may arise when the chances are equal on both sides and no superiority can be discovered in one above the other Nay in this situation the passions are rather the strongest as the mind has then the least foundation to rest upon and is tost with the greatest uncertainty Throw in a superior degree of probability to the side of grief you immediately see that passion diffuse itself over the composition and tincture it into fear Encrease the probability and by that means the grief the fear prevails still more and more till at last it runs insensibly as the joy continually diminishes into pure grief After you have brought it to this situation diminish the grief by a contrary operation to that which encreased it to wit by diminishing the probability on the melancholy side and you will see the passion clear every moment till it changes insensibly  into hope which again runs by slow degrees into joy as you encrease that part of the composition by the encrease of the probability Are not these as plain proofs that the passions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief and joy as in optics it is a proof that a coloured ray of the sun passing thro' a prism is a composition of two others when as you diminish or encrease the quantity of either you find it prevail proportionably more or less in the composition  PROBABILITY is of two kinds either when the object is itself uncertain and to be determined by chance or when tho' the object be already certain yet is it uncertain to our judgment which finds a number of proofs or presumptions on each side of the question Both these kinds of probability cause fear and hope which must proceed from that property in which they agree to wit the uncertainty and fluctuation which they bestow on the passion by that contrariety of views which is common to both  IT is a probable good or evil which commonly causes hope or fear because probability producing an inconstant and wavering survey of an object occasions naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of passion But we may observe that wherever from other causes this mixture can be produced the passions of fear and hope will arise even tho' there be no probability  AN evil conceived as barely  possible  sometimes produces fear especially if the evil be very great A man cannot think of excessive pain and torture without trembling if he runs the least risque of suffering them The smallness of the probability is compensated by the greatness of the evil  BUT even  impossible  evils cause fear as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice tho' we know ourselves to be in perfect security and have it in our choice whether we will advance a step farther The immediate presence of the evil influences the imagination and produces a species of belief but being opposed by the reflection on our security that belief is immediately  retracted and causes the same kind of passion as when from a contrariety of chances contrary passions are produced  EVILS which are  certain  have sometimes the same effect as the possible or impossible A man in a strong prison without the least means of escape trembles at the thoughts of the rack to which he is sentenced The evil is here fixed in itself but the mind has not courage to fix upon it and this fluctuation gives rise to a passion of a similar appearance with fear  BUT it is not only where good or evil is uncertain as to its  existence  but also as to its  kind  that fear or hope arises If any one were told that one of his sons is suddenly killed the passion occasioned by this event would not settle into grief till he got certain information which of his sons he had lost Tho' each side of the question produces here the same passion that passion cannot settle but receives from the imagination which is unfixt a tremulous unsteddy motion resembling the mixture and contention of grief and joy  THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a strong connexion with fear even tho' they do not cause any opposition of passions by the opposite views which they present to us Should I leave a friend in any malady I should feel more anxiety upon his account than if he were present tho' perhaps I am not only incapable of giving him assistance but likewise of judging concerning the event of his sickness There are a thousand little circumstances of his situation and condition which I desire to know and the knowledge of them would prevent that fluctuation and uncertainty so nearly allied to fear  Horace  has remarked this phaenomenon  Ut assidens implumibus pullus avis  Serpentûm allapsus timet  Magis relictis non ut adsit auxili  Latura plus praesentibus  A VIRGIN on her bridalnight goes to bed full of fears and apprehensions tho' she expects nothing but pleasure The confusion of wishes and joys the newness and greatness of the unknown event so embarrass the mind that it knows not in what image or passion to fix itself  CONCERNING the mixture of affections we may remark in general that when contrary passions arise from objects no way connected together they take place alternately Thus when a man is afflicted for the loss of a lawsuit and joyful for the birth of a son the mind running from the agreeable to the calamitous object with whatever celerity it may perform this motion can scarcely temper the one affection with the other and remain betwixt them in a state of indifference  IT more easily attains that calm situation when the  same  event is of a mixt nature and contains something adverse and something prosperous in its different circumstances For in that case both the passions mingling with each other by means of the relation often become mutually destructive and leave the mind in perfect tranquillity  BUT suppose that the object is not a compound of good and evil but is considered as probable or improbable in any degree in that case the contrary passions will both of them be present at once in the soul and instead of ballancing  and tempering each other will subsist together and by their union produce a third impression or affection such as hope or fear  THE influence of the relations of ideas which we shall afterwards explain more fully is plainly seen in this affair In contrary passions if the objects be  totally different  the passions are like two opposite liquors in different bottles which have no influence on each other If the objects be intimately  connected  the passions are like an  alcali  or an  acid  which being mingled destroy each other If the relation be more imperfect and consists in the  contradictory  views of the  same  object the passions are like oil and vinegar which however mingled never perfectly unite and incorporate  THE effect of a mixture of passions when one of them is predominant and swallows up the other shall be explained afterwards  SECT II  BESIDES those passions abovementioned which arise from a direct pursuit of good and aversion to evil there are others of a more complicated nature and imply more than one view or consideration Thus  Pride  is a certain satisfaction in ourselves on account of some accomplishment or possession which we enjoy  Humility  on the other hand is a dissatisfaction with ourselves on account of some defect or infirmity  LOVE or  Friendship  is a complacency in another on account of his accomplishments or services  Hatred  the contrary  IN these two sets of passions there is an obvious distinction to be made betwixt the  object  of the passion and its  cause  The object of pride and humility is self The cause of the passion is some excellence in the former case some fault in the latter The object of love and hatred is some other person The causes  in like manner are either excellencies or faults  WITH regard to all these passions the causes are what excite the emotion the object is what the mind directs its view to when the emotion is excited Our merit for instance raises pride and it is essential to pride to turn our view on ourself with complacency and satisfaction  Now as the causes of these passions are very numerous and various tho' their object be uniform and simple it may be a subject of curiosity to consider what that circumstance is in which all these various causes agree or in other words what is the real efficient cause of the passion We shall begin with pride and humility  IN order to explain the causes of these passions we must reflect on certain properties which tho' they have a mighty influence on every operation both of the understanding and passions are not commonly much insisted on by philosophers The first of these is the  assciation  of ideas or that principle by which we  make an easy transition from one idea to another However uncertain and changeable our thoughts may be they are not entirely without rule and method in their changes They usually pass with regularity from one object to what resembles it is contiguous to it or produced by it  See philosophical Essays Essay iii  When one idea is present to the imagination any other united by these relations naturally follows it and enters with more facility by means of that introduction  THE  second  property which I shall observe in the human mind is a like association of impressions or emotions All  resembling  impressions are connected together and no sooner one arises than the rest naturally follow Grief and disappointment give rise to anger anger to envy envy to malice and malice to grief again In like manner our temper when elevated with joy naturally throws itself into love generosity courage pride and other resembling affections  IN the  third  place it is observable of these two kinds of association that they very much  assist and forward each other and that the transition is more easily made where they both concur in the same object Thus a man who by any injury from another is very much discomposed and ruffled in his temper is apt to find a hundred subjects of hatred discontent impatience fear and other uneasy passions especially if he can discover these subjects in or near the person who was the object of his first emotion Those principles which forward the transition of ideas here concur with those which operate on the passions and both uniting in one action bestow on the mind a double impulse  UPON this occasion I may cite a passage from an elegant writer who expresses himself in the following manner  Addison Spectator No    "As the fancy delights in every thing that is great strange or beautiful and is still the more pleased the more it finds of these perfections in the  same  object so it is capable of receiving new satisfaction by the assistance of another sense Thus any continued sound as the music of birds or a fall of waters awakens every  moment the mind of the beholder and makes him more attentive to the several beauties of the place that lie before him Thus if there arises a fragrancy of smells or perfumes they heighten the pleasure of the imagination and make even the colours and verdure of the landscape appear more agreeable for the ideas of both senses recommend each other and are pleasanter together than where they enter the mind separately As the different colours of a picture when they are well disposed set off one another and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the situation"  In these phaenomena we may remark the association both of impressions and ideas as well as the mutual assistance these associations lend to each other  IT seems to me that both these species of relation have place in producing  Pride  or  Humility  and are the real efficient causes of the passion  WITH regard to the first relation that of ideas there can be no question Whatever we are proud of must in some manner belong  to us It is always  our  knowledge  our  sense beauty possessions family on which we value ourselves Self which is the  object  of the passion must still be related to that quality or circumstance which  causes  the passion There must be a connexion betwixt them an easy transition of the imagination or a facility of the conception in passing from one to the other Where this connexion is wanting no object can either excite pride or humility and the more you weaken the connexion the more you weaken the passion  THE only subject of enquiry is whether there be a like relation of impressions or sentiments wherever pride or humility is felt whether the circumstance which causes the passion produces antecedently a sentiment similar to the passion and whether there be an easy transfusion of the one into the other  THE feeling or sentiment of pride is agreeable of humility painful An agreeable sensation is therefore related to the former a painful to the latter And if we find after examination that every object which produces  pride produces also a separate pleasure and every object that causes humility excites in like manner a separate uneasiness we must allow in that case that the present theory is fully proved and ascertained The double relation of ideas and sentiments will be acknowledged incontestible  To begin with personal merit and demerit the most obvious causes of these passions it would be entirely foreign to our present purpose to examine the foundation of moral distinctions It is sufficient to observe that the foregoing theory concerning the origin of the passions may be defended on any hypothesis The most probable system which has been advanced to explain the difference betwixt vice and virtue is that either from a primary constitution of nature or from a sense of public or private interest certain characters upon the very view and contemplation produce uneasiness and others in like manner excite pleasure The uneasiness and satisfaction produced in the spectator are essential to vice and virtue To approve of a character is to feel a delight upon its appearance To disapprove of it is to be sensible  of an uneasiness The pain and pleasure therefore being in a manner the primary source of blame or praise must also be the causes of all their effects and consequently the causes of pride and humility which are the unavoidable attendants of that distinction  BUT supposing this theory of morals should not be received it is still evident that pain and pleasure if not the sources of moral distinctions are at least inseparable from them A generous and noble character affords a satisfaction even in the survey and when presented to us tho' only in a poem or fable never fails to charm and delight us On the other hand cruelty and treachery displease from their very nature nor is it possible ever to reconcile us to these qualities either in ourselves or others Virtue therefore produces always a pleasure distinct from the pride or self satisfaction which attends it Vice an uneasiness separate from the humility or remorse  BUT a high or low conceit of ourselves arises not from those qualities alone of the mind which according to common systems of ethics have been defined parts of moral duty but from any  other which have a connexion with pleasure or uneasiness Nothing flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleasing by our wit good humour or any other accomplishment and nothing gives us a more sensible mortification than a disappointment in any attempt of that kind No one has ever been able to tell precisely what  wit  is and to shew why such a system of thought must be received under that denomination and such another rejected It is by taste alone we can decide concerning it nor are we possest of any other standard by which we can form a judgment of this nature Now what is this  taste  from which true and false wit in a manner receive their being and without which no thought can have a title to either of these denominations It is plainly nothing but a sensation of pleasure from true wit and of disgust from false without our being able to tell the reasons of that satisfaction or uneasiness The power of exciting these opposite sensations is therefore the very essence of true of false wit and consequently the cause of that vanity or mortification which arises from one or the other  BEAUTY of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight and satisfaction as deformity produces pain upon whatever subject it may be placed and whether surveyed in an animate or inanimate object If the beauty or deformity belong to our own face shape or person this pleasure or uneasiness is converted into pride or humility as having in this case all the circumstances requisite to produce a perfect transition according to the present theory  IT would seem that the very essence of beauty consists in its power of producing pleasure All its effects therefore must proceed from this circumstance And if beauty is so universally the subject of vanity it is only from its being the cause of pleasure  CONCERNING all other bodily accomplishments we may observe in general that whatever in ourselves is either useful beautiful or surprizing is an object of pride and the contrary of humility These qualities agree in producing a separate pleasure and agree in nothing else  WE are vain of the surprizing adventures which we have met with the escapes which we have made the dangers to which we have been exposed as well as of our surprising feats of vigour and activity Hence the origin of vulgar lying where men without any interest and merely out of vanity heap up a number of extraordinary events which are either the fictions of their brain or if true have no connexion with themselves Their fruitful invention supplies them with a variety of adventures and where that talent is wanting they appropriate such as belong to others in order to gratify their vanity For betwixt that passion and the sentiment of pleasure there is always a close connexion  BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body that is of self for their natural and more immediate causes we find by experience that many other objects produce these affections We found vanity upon houses gardens equipage and other external objects as well as upon personal merit and accomplishments This happens when external objects  any particular relation to  ourselves and are associated or connected with us A beautiful fish in the ocean a well proportioned animal in a forest and indeed any thing which neither belongs nor is related to us has no manner of influence on our vanity whatever extraordinary qualities it may be endowed with and whatever degree of surprize and admiration it may naturally occasion It must be someway associated with us in order to touch our pride It's idea must hang in a manner upon that of ourselves and the transition from one to the other must be easy and natural  MEN are vain of the beauty either of  their  country or  their  county or even of  their  parish Here the idea of beauty plainly produces a pleasure This pleasure is related to pride The object or cause of this pleasure is by the supposition related to self the object of pride By this double relation of sentiments and ideas a transition is made from one to the other  MEN are also vain of the temperature of the climate in which they are born of the fertility of their native soil of the goodness of the wines fruits or victuals produced by it of the softness or force of their language with  other particulars of that kind These objects have plainly a reference to the pleasures of the senses and are originally considered as agreeable to the feeling taste or hearing How could they become causes of pride except by means of that transition above explained  THERE are some who discover a vanity of an opposite kind and affect to depreciate their own country in comparison of those to which they have travelled These persons find when they are at home and surrounded with their countrymen that the strong relation betwixt them and their own nation is shar'd with so many that it is in a manner lost to them whereas that distant relation to a foreign country which is formed by their having seen it and lived in it is augmented by their considering how few have done the same For this reason they always admire the beauty utility and rarity of what they have met with abroad above what they find at home  SINCE we can be vain of a country climate or any inanimate object which bears a relation to us it is no wonder we should be vain of the qualities of those who are connected with us  by blood or friendship Accordingly we find that any qualities which when belonging to ourself produce pride produce also in a less degree the same affection when discovered in persons related to us The beauty address merit credit and honours of their kindred are carefully displayed by the proud and are considerable sources of their vanity  As we are proud of riches in ourselves we desire in order to gratify our vanity that every one who has any connexion with us should likewise be possest of them and are ashamed of such as are mean or poor among our friends and relations Our forefathers being conceived as our nearest relations every one naturally affects to be of a good family and to be descended from a long succession of rich and honourable ancestors  THOSE who boast of the antiquity of their families are glad when they can join this circumstance that their ancestors for many generations have been uinnterrupted proprietors of the  same  portion of land and that their family has never changed its possessions or been transplanted into any other county or province It is an additional  subject of vanity when they can boast that these possessions have been transmitted thro' a descent composed entirely of males and that the honours and fortune have never past thro' any female Let us endeavour to explain these phaenomena from the foregoing theory  WHEN any one values himself on the antiquity of his family the subjects of his vanity are not merely the extent of time and number of ancestors for in that respect all mankind are alike but these circumstances joined to the riches and credit of his ancestors which are supposed to reflect a lustre on himself upon account of his connextion with them Since therefore the passion depends on the connexion whatever strengthens the connexion must also encrease the passion and whatever weakens the connexion must diminish the passion But it is evident that the sameness of the possessions must strengthen the relation of ideas arising from blood and kindred and convey the fancy with greater facility from one generation to another from the remotest ancestors to their posterity who are both their heirs and their descendants By this facility the sentiment is transmitted more entire and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity  THE case is the same with the transmission of the honours and fortune thro' a succession of males without their passing thro' any female It is an obvious quality of human nature that the imagination naturally turns to whatever is important and considerable and where two objects are presented a small and a great it usually leaves the former and dwells entirely on the latter This is the reason why children commonly bear their fathers name and are esteemed to be of a nobler or meaner birth according to  his  family And tho' the mother should be possest of superior qualities to the father as often happens the  general rule  prevails notwithstanding the exception according to the doctrine which shall be explained afterwards Nay even when a superiority of any kind is so great or when any other reasons have such an effect as to make the children rather represent the mother's family than the father's the general rule still retains an efficacy sufficient to weaken the relation and make a kind of breach in the line of ancestors The imagination runs not along them with the same facility nor is able to transfer the honour and credit of the ancestors to their posterity of the same name and family so readily as when the  transition is conformable to the general rules and passes thro' the male line from father to son or from brother to brother  BUT  property  as it gives us the fullest power and authority over any object is the relation which has the greatest influence on these passions  EVERY thing belonging to a vain man is the best that is any where to be found His houses equipage furniture cloaths horses hounds excel all others in his conceit and it is easy to observe that from the least advantage in any of these he draws a new subject of pride and vanity His wine if you will believe him has a finer flavour than any other his cookery is more exquisite his table more orderly his servants more expert the air in which he lives more healthful the soil which he cultivates more fertile his fruits ripen earlier and in greater perfection Such a thing is remarkable for it's novelty such another for it's antiquity This is the workmanship of a famous artist that belonged once to such a prince or great man All objects in a word which are  useful beautiful or surprizing or are related to such may by means of property give rise to this passion These all agree in giving pleasure This alone is common to them and therefore must be the quality that produces the passion which is their common effect As every new instance is a new argument and as the instances are here without number it would seem that this theory is sufficiently confirmed by experience  RICHES imply the power of acquiring whatever is agreeable and as they comprehend many particular objects of vanity necessarily become one of the chief causes of that passion  OUR opinions of all kinds are strongly affected by society and sympathy and it is almost impossible for us to support any principle or sentiment against the universal consent of every one with whom we have any friendship or correspondence But of all our opinions those which we form in our own favour however lofty or presuming are at bottom the frailest and the most easily shaken by the contradiction  and opposition of others Our great concern in this case makes us soon alarmed and keeps our passions upon the watch Our consciousness of partiality still makes us dread a mistake And the very difficulty of judging concerning an object which is never set at a due distance from us nor is seen in a proper point of view makes us hearken anxiously to the opinions of others who are better qualified to form just opinions concerning us Hence that strong love of fame with which all mankind are possest It is in order to fix and confirm their favourable opinion of themselves not from any original passion that they seek the applauses of others And when a man desires to be praised it is for the same reason that a beauty is pleased with surveying herself in a favorable lookingglass and seeing the reflexion of her own charms  THO' it be difficult in all points of speculation to distinguish a cause which encreases an effect from one which solely produces it yet in the present case the phaenomena seem pretty strong and satisfactory in confirmation of the foregoing principle  WE receive a much greater satisfaction from the approbation of those whom we ourselves esteem and approve of than of those whom we contemn and despise  WHEN esteem is obtained after a long and intimate acquaintance it gratifies our vanity in a peculiar manner  THE suffrage of those who are shy and backward in giving praise is attended with an additional relish and enjoyment if we can obtain it in our favour  WHERE a great man is nice in his choice of favourites every one courts with greater earnestness his countenance and protection  PRAISE never gives us much pleasure unless it concur with our own opinion and extol us for those qualities in which we chiefly excel  THESE phaenomena seem to prove that the favourable opinions of others are regarded only as authorities or as confirmations of our own opinion And if they have more influence in this subject than in any other it is  easily accounted for from the nature of the subject  THUS few objects however related to us and whatever pleasure they produce are able to excite a great degree of pride or selfsatisfaction unless they be also obvious to others and engage the approbation of the spectators What disposition of mind so desirable as the peaceful resigned contented which readily submits to all the dispensations of providence and preserves a constant serenity amidst the greatest misfortunes and disappointments Yet this disposition tho' acknowledged to be a virtue or excellence is seldom the foundation of great vanity or selfapplause having no brilliant or exterior lustre and rather cheering the heart than animating the behaviour and conversation The case is the same with many other qualities of the mind body or fortune and this circumstance as well as the double relations above mentioned must be admitted to be of consequence in the production of these passions  A SECOND circumstance which is of consequence in this affair is the constancy and duration  of the object What is very casual and inconstant beyond the common course of human affairs gives little joy and less pride We are not much satisfied with the thing itself and are still less apt to feel any new degree of selfsatisfaction upon its account We foresee and anticipate its change which makes us little satisfied with the thing itself We compare it to ourselves whose existence is more durable by which means its inconstancy appears still greater It seems ridiculous to make ourselves the object of a passion on account of a quality or possession which is of so much shorter duration and attends us during so small a part of our existence  A THIRD circumstance not to be neglected is that the objects in order to produce pride or selfvalue must be peculiar to us or at least common to us with a few others The advantages of sunshine weather climate c distinguish us not from any of our companions and give us no preference or superiority The comparison which we are every moment apt to make presents no inference to our advantage and we still remain notwithstanding these enjoyments  on a level with all our friends and acquaintance  AS health and sickness vary incessantly to all men and there is no one who is solely or certainly fixed in either these accidental blessings and calamities are in a manner separated from us and are not considered as a foundation for vanity or humiliation But wherever a malady of any kind is so rooted in our constitution that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery from that moment it damps our selfconceit as is evident in old men whom nothing mortifies more than the consideration of their age and infirmities They endeavour as long as possible to conceal their blindness and deafness their rheums and gouts nor do they ever avow them without reluctance and uneasiness And tho' young men are not ashamed of every headach or cold which they fall into yet no topic is more proper to mortify human pride and make us entertain a mean opinion of our nature than this that we are every moment of our lives subject to such infirmities This proves that bodily pain and sickness are in themselves proper causes of humility tho' the custom of estimating every thing by comparison more than by  its intrinsic worth and value makes us overlook those calamities which we find incident to every one and causes us to form an idea of our merit and character independent of them  WE are ashamed of such maladies as affect others and are either dangerous or disagreeable to them Of the epilepsy because it gives a horror to every one present Of the itch because it is infectious Of the king's evil because it often goes to posterity Men always consider the sentiments of others in their judgment of themselves  A FOURTH circumstance which has an influence on these passions is  general rules  by which we form a notion of different ranks of men suitable to the power or riches of which they are possest and this notion is not changed by any peculiarities of the health or temper of the persons which may deprive them of all enjoyment in their possessions Custom readily carries us beyond the just bounds in our passions as well as in our reasonings  IT may not be amiss to observe on this occasion that the influence of general rules and  maxims on the passions very much contributes to facilitate the effects of all the principles or internal mechanism which we here explain For it seems evident that if a person fullgrown and of the same nature with ourselves were on a sudden transported into our world he would be very much embarrassed with every object and would not readily determine what degree of love or hatred of pride or humility or of any other passion should be excited by it The passions are often varied by very inconsiderable principles and these do not always play with perfect regularity especially on the the first tryal But as custom or practice has brought to light all these principles and has settled the just value of every thing this must certainly contribute to the easy production of the passions and guide us by means of general established rules in the proportions which we ought to observe in prefering one object to another This remark may perhaps serve to obviate difficulties that may arise concerning some causes which we here ascribe to particular passions and which may be esteemed too refined to operate so universally and certainly as they are found to do  SECT III  IN running over all the causes which produce the passion of pride or that of humility it would readily occur that the same circumstance if transferred from ourself to another person would render him the object of love or hatred esteem or contempt The virtue genius beauty family riches and authority of others beget favourable sentiments in their behalf and their vice folly deformity poverty and meanness excite the contrary sentiments The double relation of impressions and ideas still operates on these passions of love and hatred as on the former of pride and humility Whatever gives a separate pleasure or pain and is related to another person or connected with him makes him the object of our affection or disgust  HENCE too injury or contempt is one of the greatest sources of hatred services or esteem of friendship  SOMETIMES a relation to ourself excites affection towards any person But there is always here implied a relation of sentiments without which the other relation would have no influence  The affection of parents to children seems founded on an original instinct The affection towards other relations depends on the principles here explained    A PERSON who is related to us or connected with us by blood by similitude of fortune of adventures profession or country soon becomes an agreeable companion to us because we enter easily and familiarly into his sentiments and conceptions Nothing is strange or new to us Our imagination passing from self which is ever intimately present to us runs smoothly along the relation or connexion and conceives with a full sympathy the person who is nearly related to self He renders himself immediately acceptable and is at once on an easy footing with us No distance no reserve has place where the person introduced is supposed so closely connected with us  RELATION has here the same influence as custom or acquaintance in exciting affection  and from like causes The ease and satisfaction which in both cases attend our intercourse or commerce is the source of the friendship  THE passions of love and hatred are always followed by or rather conjoined with benevolence and anger It is this conjunction which chiefly distinguishes these affections from pride and humility For pride and humility are pure emotions in the soul unattended with any desire and not immediately exciting us to action But love and hatred are not compleat within themselves nor rest in that emotion which they produce but carry the mind to something farther Love is always followed by a desire of happiness to the person beloved and an aversion to his misery As hatred produces a desire of the misery and an aversion to the happiness of the person hated These opposite desires seem to be originally and primarily conjoined with the passions of love and hatred It is a constitution of nature of which we can give no farther explication  COMPASSION frequently arises where there is no preceding esteem or friendship and compassion is an uneasiness in the sufferings of another It seems to spring from the intimate and strong conception of his sufferings and our imagination proceeds by degrees from the lively idea to the real feeling of another's misery  MALICE and envy also arise in the mind without any preceding hatred or injury tho' their tendency is exactly the same with that of anger and illwill The comparison of ourselves with others seems the source of envy and malice The more unhappy another is the more happy do we ourselves appear in our own conception  THE similar tendency of compassion to that of benevolence and of envy to anger forms a very close relation betwixt these two sets of passions tho' of a different kind from that insisted on above It is not a resemblance of feeling or sentiment but a resemblance of tendency or direction Its effect however is the same in producing an association of passions Compassion  is seldom or never felt without some mixture of tenderness or friendship and envy is naturally accompanied with anger or illwill To desire the happiness of another from whatever motive is a good preparative to affection And to delight in another's misery almost unavoidably begets aversion towards him  EVEN where interest is the source of our concern it is commonly attended with the same consequences A partner is a natural object of friendship a rival of enmity  POVERTY meanness disappointment produce contempt and dislike But when these misfortunes are very great or are represented to us in very strong colours they excite compassion and tenderness and friendship How is this contradiction to be accounted for The poverty and meanness of another in their common appearance gives us uneasiness by a species of imperfect sympathy and this uneasiness produces aversion or dislike from the resemblance of sentiment But when we enter more intimately into another's concerns and wish for his happiness as well as feel his misery friendship  or goodwill arises from the similar tendency of the inclinations  IN respect there is a mixture of humility along with the esteem or affection In contempt a mixture of pride  THE amorous passion is usually compounded of complacency in beauty a bodily appetite and friendship or affection The close relation of these sentiments is very obvious as well as their origin from each other by means of that relation Were there no other phaenomenon to reconcile as to the present theory this alone methinks were sufficient  SECT IV  THE present theory of the passions depends entirely on the double relations of sentiments and ideas and the mutual assistance which these relations lend to each other It may not therefore be improper to illustrate these principles by some farther instances  THE virtues talents accomplishments and possessions of others make us love and esteem them Because these objects excite a pleasant sensation which is related to love and having also a relation or connexion with the person this union of ideas forwards the union of sentiments according to the foregoing reasoning  BUT suppose that the person whom we love is also related to us by blood country or friendship it is evident that a species of pride must also be excited by his accomplishments and possessions there being the same double relation which we have all along insisted on The person is related to us or there  is an easy transition of thought from him to us and the sentiments excited by his advantages and virtues are agreeable and consequently related to pride Accordingly we find that people are naturally vain of the good qualities or high fortune of their friends and countrymen  BUT it is observable that if we reverse the order of the passions the same effect does not follow We pass easily from love and affection to pride and vanity but not from the latter passions to the former tho' all the relations be the same We love not those related to us on account of our own merit tho' they are naturally vain on account of our merit What is the reason of this difference The transition of the imagination to ourselves from objects related to us is always very easy both on account of the relation which facilitates the transition and because we there pass from remoter objects to those which are contiguous But in passing from ourselves to objects related to us tho' the former principle forwards the transition of thought yet the latter opposes it and consequently there is not the same easy  transfusion of passions from pride to love as from love to pride  THE virtues services and fortune of one man inspire us readily with esteem and affection for another related to him The son of our friend is naturally entitled to our friendship The kindred of a very great man value themselves and are valued by others on account of that relation The force of the double relation is here fully displayed  THE following are instances of another kind where the operation of these principles may still be discovered Envy arises from a superiority in others but it is observable that it is not the great disproportion betwixt us which excites that passion but on the contrary our proximity A great disproportion cuts off the relation of the ideas and either keeps us from comparing ourselves with what is remote from us or diminishes the effects of the comparison  A POET is not apt to envy a philosopher or a poet of a different kind of a different nation  or of a different age All these differences if they do not prevent at least weaken the comparison and consequently the passion  THIS too is the reason why all objects appear great or little merely by a comparison with those of the same species A mountain neither magnifies nor diminishes a horse in our eyes But when a  Flemish  and a  Welch  horse are seen together the one appears greater and the other less than when viewed apart  FROM the same principle we may account for that remark of historians that any party in a civil war or even factious division always choose to call in a foreign enemy at any hazard rather than submit to their fellowcitizens  Guicciardin  applies this remark to the wars in  Italy  where the relations betwixt the different states are properly speaking nothing but of name language and contiguity Yet even these relations when joined with superiority by making the comparison more natural make it likewise more grievous and cause men to search for some other superiority which may be attended with no relation and by that means may have a less sensible influence on the  imagination When we cannot break the association we feel a stronger desire to remove the superiority This seems to be the reason why travellers tho' commonly lavish of their praises to the  Chinese  and  Persians  take care to depreciate those neighbouring nations which may stand upon a footing of rivalship with their native country  THE fine arts afford us parallel instances Should an author compose a treatise of which one part was serious and profound another light and humourous every one would condemn so strange a mixture and would blame him for the neglect of all rules of art and criticism Yet we accuse not  Prior  for joining his  Alma  and  Solomon  in the same volume tho' that amiable poet has succeeded perfectly in the gaiety of the one as well as in the melancholy of the other Even suppose the reader should peruse these two compositions without any interval he would feel little or no difficulty in the change of the passions Why but because he considers these performances as entirely different and by that break in the ideas breaks the progress  of the affections and hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the other  AN heroic and burlesque design united in one picture would be monstrous tho' we place two pictures of so opposite a character in the same chamber and even close together without any scruple  IT needs be no matter of wonder that the easy transition of the imagination should have such an influence on all the passions It is this very circumstance which forms all the relations and connexions amongst objects We know no real connexion betwixt one thing and another We know only that the idea of one thing is associated with that of another and that the imagination makes an easy transition betwixt them And as the easy transition of ideas and that of sentiments mutually assist each other we might beforehand expect that this principle must have a mighty influence on all our internal movements and affections And experience sufficiently confirms the theory  FOR not to repeat all the foregoing instances Suppose that I were travelling with a companion thro' a country to which we are both utter strangers it is evident that if the prospects be beautiful the roads agreeable and the fields finely cultivated this may serve to put me in good humour both with myself and fellowtraveller But as the country has no connexion with myself or friend it can never be the immediate cause either of selfvalue or of regard to him And therefore if I found not the passion on some other object which bears to one of us a closer relation my emotions are rather to be considered as the overflowings of an elevated or humane disposition than as an established passion But supposing the agreeable prospect before us to be surveyed either from his countryseat or from mine this new connexion of ideas gives a new direction to the sentiment of pleasure proceeding from the prospect and raises the emotion of regard or vanity according to the nature of the connexion There is not here methinks much room for doubt or difficulty  SECT V  IT seems evident that reason in a strict sense as meaning the judgment of truth and falshood can never of itself be any motive to the will and can have no influence but so far as it touches some passion or affection  Abstract relations  of ideas are the object of curiosity not of volition And  matters of fact  where they are neither good nor evil where they neither excite desire nor aversion are totally indifferent and whether known or unknown whether mistaken or rightly apprehended cannot be regarded as any motive to action  WHAT is commonly in a popular sense called reason and is so much recommended in moral discourses is nothing but a general and a calm passion which takes a comprehensive and distant view of its object and actuates the will without exciting any sensible emotion A man we say is diligent in his profession from reason that is from a calm desire of riches and a fortune A man adheres to justice from reason  that is from a calm regard to a character with himself and others  THE same objects which recommend themselves to reason in this sense of the word are also the objects of what we call passion when they are brought near to us and acquire some other advantages either of external situation or congruity to our internal temper and by that means excite a turbulent and sensible emotion Evil at a great distance is avoided we say from reason Evil near at hand produces aversion horror fear and is the object of passion  THE common error of metaphysicians has lain in ascribing the direction of the will entirely to one of these principles and supposing the other to have no influence Men often act knowingly against their interest It is not therefore the view of the greatest possible good which always influences them Men often counteract a violent passion in prosecution of their distant interests and designs It is not therefore the present uneasiness alone which determines them  In general we may observe that both these principles operate on the will and where they are contrary that either of them prevails according to the general character or present disposition of the person What we call  strength of mind  implies the prevalence of the calm passions above the violent tho' we may easily observe that there is no person so constantly possest of this virtue as never on any occasion to yield to the sollicitation of violent affections and desires From these variations of temper proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning the future actions and resolutions of men where there is any contrariety of motives and passions  SECT VI  WE shall here enumerate some of those circumstances which render a passion calm or violent which heighten or diminish any emotion  IT is a property in human nature that any emotion which attends a passion is easily converted into it tho' in their natures they be originally different from and even contrary to each other It is true in order to cause a perfect union amongst passions and make one produce the other there is always required a double relation according to the theory above delivered But when two passions are already produced by their separate causes and are both present in the mind they readily mingle and unite tho' they have but one relation and sometimes without any The predominant passion swallows up the inferior and converts it into itself The spirits when once excited easily receive a change in their direction and it is natural to imagine that this change will come from the prevailing affection The connexion  is in many cases closer betwixt any two passions than betwixt any passion and indifference  WHEN a person is once heartily in love the little faults and caprices of his mistress the jealousies and quarrels to which that commerce is so subject however unpleasant they be and rather connected with anger and hatred are yet found in many instances to give additional force to the prevailing passion It is a common artifice of politicians when they would affect any person very much by a matter of fact of which they intend to inform him first to excite his curiosity delay as long as possible the satisfying it and by that means raise his anxiety and impatience to the utmost before they give him a full insight into the business They know that his curiosity will precipitate him into the passion which they purpose to raise and will assist the object in its influence on the mind A soldier advancing to battle is naturally inspired with courage and confidence when he thinks on his friends and fellowsoldiers and is struck with fear and terror when he reflects on the enemy Whatever new emotion therefore proceeds from the former naturally encreases  the courage as the same emotion proceeding from the latter augments the fear Hence in martial discipline the uniformity and lustre of habit the regularity of figures and motions with all the pomp and majesty of war encourage ourselves and our allies while the same objects in the enemy strike terror into us tho' agreeable and beautiful in themselves  HOPE is in itself an agreeable passion and allied to friendship and benevolence yet is it able sometimes to blow up anger when that is the predominant passion  Spes addita suscitat iras  Virg  SINCE passions however independent are naturally transfused into each other if they are both present at the same time it follows that when good or evil is placed in such a situation as to cause any particular emotion besides its direct passion of desire or aversion that latter passion must acquire new force and violence  THIS often happens when any object excites contrary passions For it is observable  that an opposition of passions commonly causes a new emotion in the spirits and produces more disorder than the concurrence of any two affections of equal force This new emotion is easily converted into the predominant passion and in many instances is observed to encrease its violence beyond the pitch at which it would have arrived had it met with no opposition Hence we naturally desire what is forbid and often take a pleasure in performing actions merely because they are unlawful The notion of duty when opposite to the passions is not always able to overcome them and when it fails of that influence is apt rather to encrease and irritate them by producing an opposition in our motives and principles  THE same effect follows whether the opposition arises from internal motives or external obstacles The passion commonly acquires new force in both cases The efforts which the mind makes to surmount the obstacle excite the spirits and enliven the passion  UNCERTAINTY has the same effect as opposition The agitation of the thought the quick turns which it makes from one view to another the variety of passions which succeed each other according to the different views All these produce an agitation in the mind and this agitation transfuses itself into the predominant passion  SECURITY on the contrary diminishes the passions The mind when left to itself immediately languishes and in order to preserve its ardour must be every moment supported by a new flow of passion For the same reason despair tho' contrary to security has a like influence  NOTHING more powerfully excites any affection than to conceal some part of its object by throwing it into a kind of shade which at the same time that it shows enough to prepossess us in favour of the object leaves still some work for the imagination Besides that obscurity is always attended with a kind of uncertainty the effort which the fancy makes to  compleat the idea rouzes the spirits and gives an additional force to the passion  As despair and security tho' contrary produce the same effects so absence is observed to have contrary effects and in different circumstances either encreases or diminishes our affection  Rochesoucault  has very well remarked that absence destroys weak passions but encreases strong as the wind extinguishes a candle but blows up a fire Long absence naturally weakens our idea and diminishes the passion But where the passion is so strong and lively as to support itself the uneasiness arising from absence encreases the passion and gives it new force and influence  WHEN the soul applies itself to the performance of any action or the conception of any object to which it is not accustomed there is a certain unpliableness in the faculties and a difficulty of the spirits moving in their new direction As this difficulty excites the spirits it is the source of wonder surprize and of all the emotions which arise from novelty  and is in itself very agreeable like every thing which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree But tho' surprise be agreeable in itself yet as it puts the spirits in agitation it not only augments our agreeable affections but also our painful according to the foregoing principle Hence every thing that is new is most affecting and gives us either more pleasure or pain than what strictly speaking should naturally follow from it When it often returns upon us the novelty wears off the passions subside the hurry of the spirits is over and we survey the object with greater tranquillity  THE imagination and affections have a close union together The vivacity of the former gives force to the latter Hence the prospect of any pleasure with which we are acquainted affects us more than any other pleasure which we may own superior but of whose nature we are  wholly  ignorant Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea The other we conceive under the general notion of pleasure  ANY satisfaction which we lately enjoyed and of which the memory is fresh and recent operates on the will with more violence than another of which the traces are decayed and almost obliterated  A PLEASURE which is suitable to the way of life in which we are engaged excites more our desires and appetites than another which is foreign to it  NOTHING is more capable of infusing any passion into the mind than eloquence by which objects are represented in the strongest and most lively colours The bare opinion of another especially when inforced with passion will cause an idea to have an influence upon us tho' that idea might otherwise have been entirely neglected  IT is remarkable that lively passions commonly attend a lively imagination In this respect as well as others the force of the passion depends as much on the temper of the person as on the nature or situation of the object  WHAT is distant either in place or time has not equal influence with what is near and contiguous  I PRETEND not here to have exhausted this subject It is sufficient for my purpose if I have made it appear that in the production and conduct of the passions there is a certain regular mechanism which is susceptible of as accurate a disquisition as the laws of motion optics hydrostatics or any part of natural philosophy  DISSERTATION III OF TRAGEDY  DISSERTATION III Of Tragedy  IT seems an unaccountable pleasure which the spectators of a wellwrote tragedy receive from sorrow terror anxiety and other passions which are in themselves disagreeable and uneasy The more they are touched and affected the more are they delighted with the spectacle and as soon as the uneasy passions cease to operate the piece is at an end One scene of full joy and contentment and security is the utmost that any composition of this kind can bear and it is sure always to be the concluding one If in the texture of the piece there be interwoven any scenes of satisfaction they afford only faint gleams of pleasure which are thrown in by way of variety and in order to plunge the actors into deeper distress by means of that contrast and disappointment The whole art of the poet is employed in rouzing and supporting the compassion and indignation the anxiety and resentment of his audience  They are pleased in proportion as they are afflicted and never are so happy as when they employ tears sobs and cries to give vent to their sorrow and relieve their heart swoln with the tenderest sympathy and compassion  THE few critics who have had some tincture of philosophy have remarked this singular phaenomenon and have endeavoured to account for it  L'ABBE  Dubos  in his reflections on poetry and painting asserts that nothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the languid listless state of indolence into which it falls upon the removal of every passion and occupation To get rid of this painful situation it seeks every amusement and pursuit business gaming shows executions whatever will rouze the passions and take its attention from itself No matter what the passion is Let it be disagreeable afflicting melancholy disordered it is still better than that insipid languor which arises from perfect tranquillity and repose  IT is impossible not to admit this account as being at least in part satisfactory You may observe when there are several tables of gaming that all the company run to those where the deepest play is even tho' they find not there the finest players The view or at least imagination of high passions arising from great loss or gain affects the spectators by sympathy gives them some touches of the same passions and serves them for a momentary entertainment It makes the time pass the easier with them and is some relief to that oppression under which men commonly labour when left entirely to their own thoughts and meditations  WE find that common lyars always magnify in their narrations all kinds of danger pain distress sickness deaths murders and cruelties as well as joy beauty mirth and magnificence It is an absurd secret which they have for pleasing their company fixing their attention and attaching them to such marvellous relations by the passions and emotions which they excite  THERE is however a difficulty of applying to the present subject in its full extent this solution  however ingenious and satisfactory it may appear It is certain that the same object of distress which pleases in a tragedy were it really set before us would give the most unfeigned uneasiness tho' it be then the most effectual cure of languor and indolence Monsieur  Fontenelle  seems to have been sensible of this difficulty and accordingly attempts another solution of the phaenomenon at least makes some addition to the theory abovementioned  Reflexions sur la poetique §    "PLEASURE and pain"  says he  "which are two sentiments so different in themselves differ not so much in their cause From the instance of tickling it appears that the movement of pleasure pushed a little too far becomes pain and that the movement of pain a little moderated becomes pleasure Hence it proceeds that there is such a thing as a sorrow soft and agreeable It is a pain weakened and diminished The heart likes naturally to be moved and affected Melancholy objects suit it and even disastrous and sorrowful provided they are softened by some circumstance It is certain that on the theatre the representation has almost the effect of reality  but yet is has not altogether that effect However we may be hurried away by the spectacle whatever dominion the senses and imagination may usurp over the reason there still lurks at the bottom a certain idea of falshood in the whole of what we see This idea tho' weak and disguised suffices to diminish the pain which we suffer from the misfortunes of those whom we love and to reduce that affliction to such a pitch as converts it into a pleasure We weep for the misfortune of a hero to whom we are attached In the same instant we comfort ourselves by reflecting that it is nothing but a fiction And it is precisely that mixture of sentiments which composes an agreeable sorrow and tears that delight us But as that affliction which is caused by exterior and sensible objects is stronger than the consolation which arises from an internal reflection they are the effects and symptoms of sorrow which ought to prevail in the composition"  THIS solution seems just and convincing but perhaps it wants still some new addition in order to make it answer fully the phaenomenon  which we here examine All the passions excited by eloquence are agreeable in the highest degree as well as those which are moved by painting and the theatre The epilogues of  Cicero  are on this account chiefly the delight of every reader of taste and it is difficult to read some of them without the deepest sympathy and sorrow His merit as an orator no doubt depends much on his success in this particular When he had raised tears in his judges and all his audience they were then the most highly delighted and expressed the greatest satisfaction with the pleader The pathetic description of the butchery made by  Verres  of the  Sicilian  captains is a masterpiece of this kind But I believe none will affirm that the being present at a melancholy scene of that nature would afford any entertainment Neither is the sorrow here softened by fiction For the audience were convinced of the reality of every circumstance What is it then which in this case raises a pleasure from the bosom of uneasiness so to speak and a pleasure which still retains all the features and outward symptoms of distress and sorrow  I ANSWER This extraordinary effect proceeds from that very eloquence with which the  melancholy scene is represented The genius required to paint objects in a lively manner the art employed in collecting all the pathetic circumstances the judgment displayed in disposing them the exercise I say of these noble talents along with the force of expression and beauty of oratorial numbers diffuse the highest satisfaction on the audience and excite the most delightful movements By this means the uneasiness of the melancholy passions is not only overpowered and effaced by something stronger of an opposite kind but the whole movement of those passions is converted into pleasure and swells the delight which the eloquence raises in us The same force of oratory employed on an uninteresting subject would not please half so much or rather would appear altogether ridiculous and the mind being left in absolute calmness and indifference would relish none of those beauties of imagination or expression which if joined to passion give it such exquisite entertainment The impulse or vehemence arising from sorrow compassion indignation receives a new direction from the sentiments of beauty The latter being the predominant emotions seize the whole mind and convert the former into themselves or at least tincture  them so strongly as totally to alter their nature And the soul being at the same time rouzed by passion and charmed by eloquence feels on the whole a strong movement which is altogether delightful  THE same principle takes place in tragedy along with this addition that tragedy is an imitation and imitation is always of itself agreeable This circumstance serves still farther to smooth the motions of passion and convert the whole feeling into one uniform and strong enjoyment Objects of the greatest terror and distress please in painting and please more than the most beautiful objects that appear calm and indifferent  Painters make no scruple of representing distress and sorrow as well as any other passion But they seem not to dwell so much on these melancholy affections as the poets who tho' they copy every emotion of the human breast yet pass very quickly over the agreeable sentiments A painter represents only one instant and if that be passionate enough it is sure to affect and delight the spectator But nothing can furnish to the poet a variety of scenes and incidents and sentiments except distress terror or anxiety Compleat joy and satisfaction is attended with security and leaves no farther room for action  The affection rouzing the mind excites a large stock of spirit and vehemence which is all transformed into pleasure by the force of the prevailing movement It is thus  the fiction of tragedy softens the passion by an infusion of a new feeling not merely by weakening or diminishing the sorrow You may by degrees weaken a real sorrow till it totally disappears yet in none of its gradations will it ever give pleasure except perhaps by accident to a man sunk under lethargic indolence whom it rouzes from that languid state  To confirm this theory it will be sufficient to produce other instances where the subordinate movement is converted into the predominant and gives force to it tho' of a different and even sometimes tho' of a contrary nature  NOVELTY naturally excites the mind and attracts our attention and the movements which it causes are always converted into any passion belonging to the object and join their force to it Whether an event excites joy or sorrow pride or shame anger or goodwill it is sure to produce a stronger affection when new and unusual And tho' novelty of itself be agreeable it enforces the painful as well as agreeable passions  HAD you any intention to move a person extremely by the narration of any event the best method of encreasing its effect would be artfully to delay informing him of it and first excite his curiosity and impatience before you let him into the secret This is the artifice practiced by  Iago  in the famous scene of  Shakespeare  and every spectator is sensible that  Othello's  jealousy acquires additional force from his preceding impatience and that the subordinate passion is here readily transformed into the predominant  DIFFICULTIES encrease passions of every kind and by rouzing our attention and exciting our active powers they produce an emotion which nourishes the prevailing affection  PARENTS commonly love that child most whose sickly infirm frame of body has occasioned them the greatest pains trouble and anxiety in rearing him The agreeable sentiment of affection here acquires force from sentiments of uneasiness  NOTHING endears so much a friend as sorrow for his death The pleasure of his company has not so powerful an influence  JEALOUSY is a painful passion yet without some share of it the agreeable affection of love has difficulty to subsist in its full force and violence Absence is also a great source of complaint amongst lovers and gives them the greatest uneasiness Yet nothing is more favorable to their mutual passion than short intervals of that kind And if long intervals be pernicious it is only because thro' time men are accustomed to them and they cease to give uneasiness Jealousy and absence in love compose the  dolce piccante  of the  Italians  which they suppose so essential to all pleasure  THERE is a fine observation of the elder  Pliny  which illustrates the principle here insisted on  It is very remarkable  says he  that the last works of celebrated artists which they left imperfect are always the most prized such as the  Iris  of  Aristides  the  Tyndarides  of  Nicomachus  the  Medea  of  Timomachus  and the  Venus  of  Apelles  These are valued even above their finished productions The broken lineaments  of the piece and the half formed idea of the painter are carefully studied and our very grief for that curious hand which had been stoped by death is an additional encrease to our pleasure  Illud vero perquam rarum ac memoria dignum etiam suprema opera artificum imperfectasque tabulas sicut Irin Aristidis Tyndaridas Nicomachi Medeam Timomachi quam diximus Venerem Apellis in majori admiratione esse quam perfecta Quippe in iis lineamenta reliqua ipsaeque cogitationes artificum spectantur atque in lenocinio commendationis dolor est manus cum id ageret extinctae  lib xxxv c II    THESE instances and many more might be collected are sufficient to afford us some insight into the analogy of nature and to show us that the pleasure which poets orators and musicians give us by exciting grief sorrow indignation compassion is not so extraordinary nor paradoxical as it may at first sight appear The force of imagination the energy of expression the power of numbers the charms of imitation all these are naturally of themselves delightful to the mind and when the object presented lays also hold of some affection the pleasure still rises upon us by the conversion of this subordinate movement into that which is predominant The passion tho' perhaps naturally and when excited by the simple appearance  of a real object it may be painful yet is so smoothed and softened and mollified when raised by the finer arts that it affords the highest entertainment  TO confirm this reasoning we may observe that if the movements of the imagination be not predominant above those of the passion a contrary effect follows and the former being now subordinate is converted into the latter and still farther encreases the pain and affliction of the sufferer  WHO could ever think of it as a good expedient for comforting an afflicted parent to exaggerate with all the force of oratory the irreparable loss which he has met with by the death of a favorite child The more power of imagination and expression you here employ the more you encrease his despair and affliction  THE shame confusion and terror of  Verres  no doubt rose in proportion to the noble eloquence and vehemence of  Cicero  So also did his pain and uneasiness These former passions were too strong for the pleasure arising from the beauties of elocution and operated  tho' from the same principle yet in a contrary manner to the sympathy compassion and indignation of the audience  LORD  Clarendon  when he approaches the catastrophe of the royal party supposes that his narration must then become infinitely disagreeable and he hurries over the King's death without giving us one circumstance of it He considers it as too horrid a scene to be contemplated with any satisfaction or even without the utmost pain and aversion He himself as well as the readers of that age were too deeply interested in the events and felt a pain from subjects which an historian and a reader of another age would regard as the most pathetic and most interesting and by consequence the most agreeable  AN action represented in tragedy may be too bloody and atrocious It may excite such movements of horror as will not soften into pleasure and the greatest energy of expression bestowed on descriptions of that nature serves only to augment our uneasiness Such is that action represented in the  ambitious Stepmother  where a venerable old man raised to the height  of fury and despair rushes against a pillar and striking his head upon it besmears it all over with mingled brains and gore The  English  theatre abounds too much with such images  EVEN the common sentiments of compassion require to be softened by some agreeable affection in order to give a thorough satisfaction to the audience The mere suffering of plaintive virtue under the triumphant tyranny and oppression of vice forms a disagreeable spectacle and is carefully avoided by all masters of the theatre In order to dismiss the audience with entire satisfaction and contentment the virtue must either convert itself into a noble courageous despair or the vice receive its proper punishment  MOST painters appear in this light to have been very unhappy in their subjects As they wrought for churches and convents they have chiefly represented such horrible subjects as crucifixions and martyrdoms where nothing appears but tortures wounds executions and passive suffering without any action or affection When they turned their pencil from this ghastly mythology they had recourse commonly to  Ovid  whose fictions tho' passionate and agreeable are scarce natural or probable enough for painting  THE same inversion of that principle which is here insisted on displays itself in common life as in the effects of oratory and poetry Raise so the subordinate passion that it becomes the predominant it swallows up that affection which it before nourished and encreased Too much jealousy extinguishes love Too much difficulty renders us indifferent Too much sickness and infirmity disgusts a selfish and unkind parent  WHAT so disagreeable as the dismal gloomy disastrous stories with which melancholy people entertain their companions The uneasy passion being there raised alone unaccompanied with any spirit genius or eloquence conveys a pure uneasiness and is attended with nothing that can soften it into pleasure or satisfaction  DISSERTATION IV OF THE STANDARD OF TASTE  DISSERTATION IV Of the Standard of Taste  THE great variety of Tastes as well as of opinions which prevail in the world is too obvious not to have fallen under every one's observation Men of the most confined knowledge are able to remark a difference in the narrow circle of their acquaintance even where the persons have been educated under the same government and have early imbibed the same prejudices But those who can enlarge their view to contemplate distant nations and remote ages are still more surprised at the great inconsistence and contradiction We are apt to call  barbarous  whatever departs widely from our own taste and apprehension But soon find the epithet of reproach retorted on us And the highest arrogance and self conceit is at last startled on observing an equal assurance on all sides and scruples amidst such a contest of sentiments to pronounce positively in its own favour  As this variety of taste is obvious to the most careless enquirer so will it be found on examination  to be still greater in reality than in appearance The sentiments of men often differ with regard to beauty and deformity of all kinds even while their general discourse is the same There are certain terms in every language which import blame and others praise and all men who use the same tongue must agree in their application of them Every voice is united in applauding elegance propriety simplicity spirit in writing and in blaming fustian affectation coldness and a false brilliant But when critics come to particulars this seeming unanimity vanishes and it is found that they had affixed a very different meaning to their expressions In all matters of opinion and science the case is opposite The difference among men is there oftner found to lie in generals than in particulars and to be less in reality than in appearance An explication of the terms commonly ends the controversy and the disputants are surprized to find that they had been quarrelling while at bottom they agreed in their judgment  THOSE who found morality on sentiment more than on reason are inclined to comprehend ethics under the former observation and to suppose that in all questions which regard conduct  and manners the difference among men is really greater than at first fight it appears It is indeed obvious that writers of all nations and all ages concur in applauding justice humanity magnanimity prudence veracity and in blaming the opposite qualities Even poets and other authors whose compositions are chiefly calculated to please the imagination are yet found from  Homer  down to  Fenelon  to inculcate the same moral precepts and to bestow their applause and blame on the same virtues and vices This great unanimity is usually ascribed to the influence of plain reason which in all these cases maintains similar sentiments in all men and prevents those controversies to which the abstract sciences are so much exposed So far as the unanimity is real the account may be admitted as satisfactory But it must also be allowed that some part of the seeming harmony in morals may be accounted for from the very nature of language The word  virtue  with its equivalent in every tongue implies praise as that of  vice  does blame And no one without the most obvious and grossest impropriety could affix reproach to a term which in general use is understood in a good sense or bestow applause where the idiom requires disapprobation  Homer's  general precepts where he delivers any such will never be controverted but it is very obvious that when he draws particular pictures of manners and represents heroism in  Achilles  and prudence in  Ulysses  he intermixes a much greater degree of ferocity in the former and of cunning and fraud in the latter than  Fenelon  would admit of The sage  Ulysses  in the  Greek  poet seems to delight in lies and fictions and often employs them without any necessity or even advantage But his more scrupulous son in the  French  epic writer exposes himself to the most imminent perils rather than depart from the exactest line of truth and veracity  THE admirers and followers of the  Alcoran  insist very much on the excellent moral precepts which are interspersed throughout that wild performance But it is to be supposed that the  Arabic  words which correspond to the  English  equity justice temperance meekness charity were such as from the constant use of that tongue must always be taken in a good sense and it would have argued the greatest ignorance not of morals but of language to have mentioned them with any epithets besides those of applause and approbation But would we know  whether the pretended prophet had really attained a just sentiment of morals Let us attend to his narration and we shall soon find that he bestows praise on such instances of treachery inhumanity cruelty revenge bigotry as are utterly incompatible with civilized society No steddy rule of right seems there to be attended to and every action is blamed or praised so far only as it is beneficial or hurtful to the true believers  THE merit of delivering true general precepts in ethics is indeed very small Whoever recommends any moral virutes really does no more than is implied in the terms themselves The people who invented the word  modesty  and used it in a good sense inculcated more clearly and much more efficaciously the precept  be modest  than any pretended legislator or prophet who should insert such a  maxim  in his writings Of all expressions those which together with their other meaning imply a degree either of blame or approbation are the least liable to be perverted or mistaken  It is very natural for us to seek a  Standard of Taste  a rule by which the various sentiments of men may be reconciled or at least a decision  afforded confirming one sentiment and condemning another  THERE is a species of philosophy which cuts off all hopes of success in such an attempt and represents the impossibility of ever attaining any standard of taste The difference it is said is very wide between judgment and sentiment All sentiment is right because sentiment has a reference to nothing beyond itself and is always real wherever a man is conscious of it But all determinations of the understanding are not right because they have a reference to something beyond themselves to wit real matter of fact and are not always conformable to that standard Among a thousand different opinions which different men amy entertain of the same subject there is one and but one that is just and true and the only difficulty is to fix and ascertain it On the contrary a thousand different sentiments excited by the same object are all right Because no sentiment represents what is really in the object It only marks a certain conformity or relation betwixt the object and the organs or faculties of the mind and if that conformity did not really exist the sentiment could never possibly have a being Beauty is no  quality in things themselves It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them and each mind perceives a different beauty One person may even perceive deformity where another is sensible of beauty and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment without pretending to regulate those of others To seek the real beauty or real deformity is as fruitless an enquiry as to pretend to ascertain the real sweet or real bitter According to the disposition of the organs the same object may be both sweet and bitter and the proverb has justly determined it to be fruitless to dispute concerning tastes It is very natural and even quite necessary to extend this axiom to mental as well as bodily taste and thus common sense which is so often at variance with philosophy especially with the sceptical kind is found in one instance at least to agree in pronouncing the same decision  BUT though this axiom by passing into a proverb seems to have attained the sanction of common sense there is certainly a species of common sense which opposes it or at least serves to modify and restrain it Whoever would assert an equality of genius and elegance betwixt  Ogilby  and  Milton  or  Bunyan  and  Addison  would be thought to defend no less an extravagance than if he had maintained a molehill to be as high as  Teneriffe  or a pond as extensive as the ocean Though there may be found persons who give the preference to the former authors no one pays attention to such a taste and we pronounce without scruple the sentiment of these pretended critics to be absurd and ridiculous The principle of the natural equality of tastes is then totally forgot and while we admit of it on some occasions where the objects seem near an equality it appears an extravagant paradox or rather a palpable absurdity where objects so disproportioned are compared together  IT is evident that none of the rules of composition are fixed by reasonings  a priori  or can be esteemed abstract conclusions of the understanding from comparing those habitudes and relations of ideas which are eternal and immutable Their foundation is the same with that of all the practical sciences experience nor are they any thing but general observations concerning what has been universally found to please in all countries and in all ages Many of the beauties of poetry and even of eloquence  are founded on falshood and fiction on hyperboles metaphors and an abuse or perversion of expressions from their natural meaning To check the sallies of the imagination and to reduce every expression to geometrical truth and exactness would be the most contrary to the laws of criticism because it would produce a work which by universal experience has been found the most insipid and disagreeable But though poetry can never submit to exact truth it must be confined by rules of art discovered to the author either by genius or observation If some negligent or irregular writers have pleased they have not pleased by their transgressions of rule or order but in spite of these transgressions They have possessed other beauties which were conformable to just criticism and the force of these beauties has been able to overpower censure and give the mind a satisfaction superior to the disgust arising from the blemishes  Ariosto  pleases but not by his monstrous and improbable fictions by his bizarre mixture of the serious and comic styles by the want of coherence in his stories or by the continual interruptions of his narration He charms by the force and clearness of his expression by the readiness and variety of his inventions and by his natural  pictures of the passions especially those of the gay and amorous kind And however his faults may diminish our satisfaction they are not able entirely to destroy it Did our pleasure really arise from those parts of his poem which we denominate faults this would be no objection to criticism in general It would only be an objection to those particular rules of criticism which would establish such circumstances to be faults and would represent them as universally blameable If they are found to please they cannot be faults let the pleasure which they produce be ever so unexpected and unaccountable  BUT though all the general rules of art are founded only on experience and on the observation of the common sentiments of human nature we must not imagine that on every occasion the feelings of men will be conformable to these rules Those finer emotions of the mind are of a very tender and delicate nature and require the concurrence of many favourable circumstances to make them play with facility and exactness according to their general and established principles The least exterior hindrance to such small springs or the least internal disorder  disturbs their motion and confounds the operation of the whole machine When we would make an experiment of this nature and would try the force of any beauty or deformity we must choose with care a proper time and place and bring the fancy to a suitable situation and disposition A perfect serenity of mind a recollection of thought a due attention to the object if any of these circumstances be wanting our experiment will be fallacious and we shall be unable to judge of the catholic and universal beauty The relation which nature has placed betwixt the form and the sentiment will at least be more obscure and it will require greater accuracy to trace and discern it We shall be able to ascertain its influence not so much from the operation of each particular beauty as from the durable admiration which attends those works that have survived all the caprices of mode and fashion all the mistakes of ignorance and envy  THE same  Homer  who pleased at  Athens  and  Rome  two thousand years ago is still admired at  Paris  and at  London  All the changes of climate government religion and language have not been able to obscure his glory Authority  or prejudice may give a temporary vogue to a bad poet or orator but his reputation will never be durable or general When his compositions are examined by posterity or by foreigners the enchantment is dissipated and his faults appear in their true colours On the contrary a real genius the longer his works endure and the more wide they are spread the more sincere is the admiration which he meets with Envy and jealousy have too much place in a narrow circle and even familiar acquaintance with his person may diminish the applause due to his performances But when these obstructions are removed the beauties which are naturally fitted to excite agreeable sentiments immediately display their energy and while the world endures they maintain their authority over the minds of men  IT appears then that amidst all the variety and caprices of taste there are certain general principles of approbation or blame whose influence a careful eye may trace in all operations of the mind Some particular forms or qualities from the original structure of the internal fabric are calculated to please and others to displease and if they fail of their effect in any particular  instance it is from some apparent defect or imperfection in the organ A man in a fever would not insist on his palate as able to decide concerning flavours nor would one affected with the jaundice pretend to give a verdict with regard to colours In each creature there is a sound and a defective state and the former alone can be supposed to afford us a true standard of taste and sentiment If in the sound state of the organs there be an entire or a considerable uniformity of sentiment among men we may thence derive an idea of the perfect and universal beauty in like manner as the appearance of objects in daylight to the eye of a man in health is denominated their true and real colour even while colour is allowed to be merely a phantasm of the senses  MANY and frequent are the defects in the internal organs which prevent or weaken the influence of those general principles on which depends our sentiment of beauty or deformity Though some objects by the structure of the mind be naturally calculated to give pleasure it is not to be expected that in every individual the pleasure will be equally felt Particular incidents and situations occur which either throw  a false light on the objects or hinder the true from conveying to the imagination the proper sentiment and perception  ONE obvious cause why many feel not the proper sentiment of beauty is the want of that  delicacy  of imagination which is requisite to convey a sensibility of those finer emotions This delicacy every one pretends to Every one talks of it and would reduce every kind of taste or sentiment to its standard But as our intention in this dissertation is to mingle some light of the understanding with the feelings of sentiment it will be proper to give a more accurate definition of delicacy than has hitherto been attempted And not to draw our philosophy from too profound a source we shall have recourse to a noted story in  Don Quixote  'TIS with good reason says  Sancho  to the squire with the great nose that I pretend to have a judgment in wine This is a quality hereditary in our family Two of my kinsmen were once called to give their opinion of a hogshead which was supposed to be excellent being old and of a good vintage One of them tastes it considers it and after mature reflection pronounces  the wine to be good were it not for a small taste of leather which he perceived in it The other after using the same precautions gives also his verdict in favour of the wine but with the reserve of a taste of iron which he could easily distinguish You cannot imagine how much they were both ridiculed for their judgment But who laughed in the end On emptying the hogshead there was found at the bottom an old key with a leathern thong tied to it  THE great resemblance between mental and bodily taste will easily teach us to apply this story Though it be certain that beauty and deformity no more than sweet and bitter are not qualities in objects but belong entirely to the sentiment internal or external it must be allowed that there are certain qualities in objects which are fitted by nature to produce those particular feelings Now as these qualities may be found in a small degree or may be mixt and confounded with each other it often happens that the taste is not affected with such minute qualities or is not able to distinguish all the particular flavours amidst the disorder in which they are presented Where the organs are so fine as to allow nothing  to escape them and at the same time so exact as to perceive every ingredient in the composition This we call delicacy of taste whether we employ these terms in the natural or metaphorical sense Here then the general rules of beauty are of use being drawn from established models and from the observation of what pleases or displeases when presented singly and in a high degree And if the same qualities in a continued composition and in a smaller degree affect not the organs with a sensible delight or uneasiness we exclude the person from all pretensions to this delicacy To produce these general rules or avowed patterns of composition is like finding the key with the leathern thong which justified the verdict of  Sancho's  kinsmen and confounded those pretended judges who had condemned them Though the hogshead had never been emptied the taste of the one was still equally delicate and that of the other equally dull and languid But it would have been more difficult to have proved the superiority of the former to the conviction of every bystander In like manner though the beauties of writing had never been methodized or reduced to general principles though no excellent models had ever been acknowledged the different degrees  of taste would still have subsisted and the judgment of one man been preferable to that of another but it would not have been so easy to silence the bad critic who might always insist upon his particular sentiment and refuse to submit to his antagonist But when we show him an avowed principle of art when we illustrate this principle by examples whose operation from his own particular taste he acknowledges to be conformable to the principle when we prove that the same principle may be applied to the present case where he did not perceive nor feel its influence He must conclude upon the whole that the fault lies in himself and that he wants the delicacy which is requisite to make him sensible of every beauty and every blemish in any composition or discourse  'Tis acknowledged to be the perfection of every sense or faculty to perceive with exactness its most minute objects and allow nothing to escape its notice and observation The smaller the objects are which become sensible to the eye the finer is that organ and the more elaborate its make and composition A good palate is not tried by strong flavours but by a mixture of small ingredients where we are still sensible  of each part notwithstanding its minuteness and its confusion with the rest In like manner a quick and acute perception of beauty and deformity must be the perfection of our mental taste nor can a man be satisfied with himself while he suspects that any excellence or blemish in a discourse has passed him unobserved In this case the perfection of the man and the perfection of the sense or feeling are found to be united A very delicate palate on many occasions may be a great inconvenience both to a man himself and to his friends but a delicate taste of wit or beauty must always be a desirable quality because it is the source of all the finest and most innocent enjoyments of which human nature is susceptible In this decision the sentiments of all mankind are agreed Wherever you can fix or ascertain a delicacy of taste it is sure to be approved of and the best way of fixing it is to appeal to those models and principles which have been established by the uniform approbation and experience of nations and ages  BUT though there be naturally a very wide difference in point of delicacy between one person and another nothings tends further to encrease and improve this talent than  practice  in a particular  art and the frequent survey or contemplation of a particular species of beauty When objects of any kind are first presented to the eye or imagination the sentiment which attends them is obscure and confused and the mind is in a great measure incapable of pronouncing concerning their merits or defects The taste cannot perceive the several excellencies of the performance much less distinguish the particular character of each excellency and ascertain its quality and degree If it pronounce the whole in general to be beautiful or deformed 'tis the utmost which can be expected and even this judgment a person so unpractised will be apt to deliver with great hesitation and reserve But allow him to acquire experience in those objects his feeling becomes more exact and nice He not only perceives the beauties and defects of each part but marks the distinguishing species of each quality and assigns it suitable praise or blame A clear and distinct sentiment attends him through the whole survey of the objects and he discerns that very degree and kind of aaprobation or displeasure which each part is naturally fitted to produce The mist dissipates which seemed formerly to hang over the object The organ acquires  greater perfection in its operations and can pronounce without danger of mistake concerning the merits of each performance In a word the same address and dexterity which practice gives to the execution of any work is also acquired by the same means in the judging of it  So advantageous is practice to the discernment of beauty that before we can pronounce judgment on any work of importance it will even be requisite that that very individual performance be more than once perused by us and be surveyed in different lights with attention and deliberation There is a flutter or hurry of thought which attends the first perusal of any piece and which confounds the genuin sentiment of beauty The reference of the parts is not discerned The true characters of style are little distinguished The several perfections and defects seem wrapped up in a species of confusion and present themselves indistinctly to the imagination Not to mention that there is a species of beauty which as it is florid and superficial pleases at first but being found incompatible with a just expression either of reason or passion soon palls upon the taste and is then rejected with disdain at least rated at a much lower value  IT is impossible to continue in the practice of contemplating any order of beauty without being frequently obliged to form  comparisons  between the several species and degrees of excellency and estimating their proportion to each other A man who has had no opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beauty is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opinion with regard to any object presented to him By comparison alone we fix the epithets of praise or blame and learn how to assign the due degree of each The coarsest dawbing of a signpost contains a certain lustre of colours and exactness of imitation which are so far beauties and would affect the mind of a peasant or Indian with the highest admiration The most vulgar ballads are not entirely destitute of harmony or nature and none but a person familiarized to superior beauties would pronounce their numbers harsh or narration uninteresting A great inferiority of beauty gives pain to a person conversant in the highest excellency of the kind and is for that reason pronounced a deformity As the most finished object with which we are acquainted is naturally supposed to have reached the pinnacle of perfection and to be entitled to the highest applause  A man who has had opportunities of seeing and examining and weighing the several performances admired in different ages and nations can alone rate the merits of a work exhibited to his view and assign its proper rank among the productions of genius  BUT to enable him the more fully to execute this undertaking he must preserve his mind free from all  prejudice  and allow nothing to enter into his consideration but the very object which is submitted to his examination We may observe that every work of art in order to produce its due effect on the mind must be surveyed in a certain point of view and cannot be fully relished by persons whose situation real or imaginary is not conformable to that required by the performance An orator addresses himself to a particular audience and must have a regard to their particular genius interests opinions passions and prejudices otherwise he hopes in vain to govern their resolutions and inflame their affections Should they even have entertained some prepossessions against him however unreasonable he must not overlook this disadvantage but before he enters upon the subject must endeavour to conciliate their affection and acquire  their good graces A critic of a different age or nation who should peruse this discourse must have all these circumstances in his eye and must place himself in the same situation as the audience in order to form a true judgment of the oration In like manner when any work is addressed to the public though I should have a friendship or enmity with the author I must depart from this particular situation and considering myself as a man in general forget if possible my individual being and my peculiar circumstances A person influenced by prejudice complies not with this condition but obstinately maintains his natural position without entering into that required by the performance If the work be addressed to persons of a different age or nation he makes no allowance for their peculiar views and prejudices but full of the manners of his own times rashly condemns what seemed admirable in the eyes of those for whom alone the discourse was calculated If the work be executed for the public he never sufficiently enlarges his comprehension or forgets his interests as a friend or enemy as a rival or commentator By this means his sentiments are perverted nor have the same beauties and blemishes the same influence upon him as if he had imposed a proper  violence on his imagination and had forgot himself for a moment So far his taste evidently departs from the true standard and of consequence loses all credit and authority  IT is well known that in all questions submitted to the understanding prejudice is most destructive of sound judgment and perverts all operations of the intellectual faculties It is no less contrary to good taste nor has it less influence to corrupt our sentiments of beauty It belongs to  good sense  to check its influence in both cases and in this respect as well as in many others reason if not an essential part of taste is at least requisite to the operations of this latter faculty In all the nobler productions of genius there is a mutual relation and correspondence of parts nor can either the beauties or blemishes be perceived by him whose thought is not capacious enough to comprehend all those parts and compare them with each other in order to perceive the consistence and uniformity of the whole Every work of art has also a certain end or purpose for which it is calculated and is to be deemed more or less perfect as it is more or less fitted to attain this end The object of eloquence is to persuade of history to instruct of poetry to  please by means of the passions and the imagination These ends we must carry constantly in our view when we peruse any performance and we must be able to judge how far the means employed are adapted to their respective purposes Besides every kind of composition even the most poetical is nothing but a chain of propositions and reasonings not always indeed the justest and most exact but still plausible and specious however disguised by the colouring of the imagination The persons introduced in tragedy and epic poetry must be represented as reasoning and thinking and concluding and acting suitable to their characters and circumstances and without judgment as well as taste and invention a poet can never hope to succeed in so delicate an undertaking Not to mention that the same excellence of faculties which contributes to the improvement of reason the same clearness of conception the same exactness of distinction the same vivacity of apprehension are essential to the operations of true taste and are its infallible concomitants It seldom or never happens that a man of sense who has experience in any art cannot judge of its beauty and it is no less rare to meet with a man who has a just taste without a sound understanding  THUS though the principles of taste be universal and nearly if not entirely the same in all men yet few are qualified to give judgment on any work of art or establish their own sentiment as the standard of beauty The organs of internal sensation are seldom so perfect as to allow the general principles their full play and produce a feeling correspondent to those principles They either labour under some defect or are vitiated by some disorder and by that means excite a sentiment which may be pronounced erroneous When the critic has no delicacy he judges without any distinction and is only affected by the grosser and more palpable qualities of the object The finer touches pass unnoticed and disregarded Where he is not aided by practice his verdict is attended with confusion and hesitation Where no comparison has been employed the most frivolous beauties such as rather merit the name of defects are the objects of his admiration Where he lies under the influence of prejudice all his natural sentiments are perverted Where good sense is wanting he is not qualified to discern the beauties of design and reasoning which are the highest and most excellent Under some or other of these  imperfections the generality of men labour and hence a true judge in the finer arts is observed even during the most polished ages to be so rare a character Strong sense united to delicate sentiment improved by practice perfected by comparison and cleared of all prejudice can alone entitle critics to this valuable character and the joint verdict of such whereever they are to be found is the true standard of taste and beauty  BUT where are such critics to be found By what marks are they to be known How distinguish them from pretenders These questions are embarrassing and seem to throw us back into the same uncertainty from which during the course of this dissertation we have endeavoured to extricate ourselves  BUT if we consider the matter aright these are questions of fact not of sentiment Whether any particular person be endowed with good sense and a delicate imagination free from prejudice may often be the subject of dispute and be liable to great discussion and enquiry But that such a character is valuable and estimable will be agreed by all mankind Where these  doubts occur men can do no more than in other disputable questions which are submitted to the understanding They must produce the best arguments which their invention suggests to them they must acknowledge a true and decisive standard to exist somewhere to wit real existence and matter of fact and they must have indulgence to such as differ from them in their appeals to this standard It is sufficient for our present purpose if we have proved that the taste of all individuals is not upon an equal footing and that some men in general however difficult to be particularly pitched upon will be acknowledged by universal sentiment to have a preference above others  BUT in reality the difficulty of finding even in particulars the standard of taste is not so great as is represented Though in speculation we may readily avow a certain criterion in science and deny it in sentiment the matter is found in practice to be much more hard to ascertain in the former case than in the latter Theories of abstract philosophy systems of profound theology have prevailed during one age In a successive period these have been universally exploded Their absurdity has been detected Other theories  and systems have supplied their place which again gave way to their successors And nothing has been experienced more liable to the revolutions of chance and fashion than these pretended decisions of science The case is not the same with the beauties of eloquence and poetry Just expressions of passion and nature are sure after a little time to gain public vogue which they maintain for ever  Aristotle  and  Plato  and  Epicurus  and  Descartes  may successively yield to each other But  Terence  and  Virgil  maintain an universal undisputed empire over the minds of men The abstract philosophy of  Cicero  has lost its credit The vehemence of his oratory is still the object of our admiration  THOUGH men of delicate taste are rare they are easily to be distinguished in society by the soundness of their understanding and the superiority of their faculties above the rest of mankind The ascendant which they acquire gives a prevalence to that lively approbation with which they receive any productions of genius and renders it generally predominant Many men when left to themselves have but a saint and dubious perception of beauty who yet are capable of relishing any fine stroke which is pointed out to them Every convert to the admiration  of the true poet or orator is the cause of some new conversion And though prejudices may prevail for a time they never unite in celebrating any rival to the true genius but yield at last to the force of nature and just sentiment And thus though a civilized nation may easily be mistaken in the choice of their admired philosopher they never have been found long to err in their affection for a favourite epic or tragic author  BUT notwithstanding all our endeavours tofix a standard of taste and reconcile the various apprehensions of men there still remain two sources of variation which tho' they be not sufficient to confound all the boundaries of beauty and deformity will often serve to vary the degrees of our approbation or blame The one is the different humours of particular men the other the particular manners and opinions of our age and country The general principles of taste are uniform in human nature Where men vary in their judgments some defect or perversion in the faculties may commonly be remarked proceeding either from prejudice from want of practice or want of delicacy and there is just reason for approving one taste and condemning another But where there is such a diversity in the internal frame or external situation as is entirely  blameless on both sides and leaves no room to give one the preference above the other in that case a certain diversity of judgment is unavoidable and we seek in vain for a standard by which we can reconcile the contrary sentiments  A young man whose passions are warm will be more sensibly touched with amorous and tender images than a man more advanced in years who takes pleasure in wise and philosophical prefections concerning the conduct of life and moderation of the passions At twenty  Ovid  may be the favourite author  Horace  at forty and perhaps  Tacitus  at fifty Vainly would we in such cases endeavour to enter into the sentiments of others and divest ourselves of those propensities which are natural to us We chuse our favourite author as we do our friend from a conformity of humours and dispositions Mirth or passion sentiment or reflection which ever of these most predominates in our temper it gives us a peculiar sympathy with the writer who resembles us  ONE person is more pleased with the sublime another with the tender a third with raillery One has a strong sensibility to blemishes and is extremely studious of correctness Another has  a more lively feeling of beauties and pardons twenty absurdities and defects for one elevated or pathetic stroke The ear of this man is entirely turned towards conciseness and energy that man is delighted with a copious rich and harmonious expression Simplicity is affected by one ornament by another Comedy tragedy satire odes have each their partizans who preser that particular species of writing to all others It is plainly an error in a critic to confine his approbation to one species or style of writing and condemn all the rest But it is almost impossible not to feel a predilection for that which suits our particular turn and disposition Such preferences are innocent and unavoidable and can never reasonably be the object of dispute because there is no standard by which they can be decided  For a like reason we are more pleased with pictures of characters which resemble such as are found in our own age or country than with those which describe a different set of customs 'Tis not without some effort that we reconcile ourselves to the simplicity of antient manners and behold princesses drawing water from a spring and kings and heroes dressing their own victuals We may allow in general that the representation of such manners is no fault in the author nor deformity in the piece but we are  not so sensibly touched with them For this reason comedy is not transferred easily from one age or nation to another A  Frenchman  or  Englishman  is not pleased with the  Andria  of  Terence  or  Clitia  of  Machiavel  where the fine lady upon whom all the play turns never once appears to the spectators but is always kept behind the scenes suitable to the reserved humour of the antient  Greeks  and modern  Italians  A man of learning and reflection can make allowance for these peculiarities of manners but a common audience can never divest themselves so far of their usual ideas and sentiments as to relish pictures which no way resemble them  AND here there occurs a reflection which may perhaps be useful in examining the celebrated controversy concerning antient and modern learning where we often find the one side excusing any seeming absurdity in the antients from the manners of the age and the others refusing to admit this excuse or at least admitting it only as an apology for the author not for the performance In my opinion the proper bounds in this subject have seldom been fixed between the contending parties Where any innocent peculiarities of manners are represented such as those abovementioned they ought certainly  to be admitted and a man who is shocked with them gives an evident proof of false delicacy and refinement The poets  monument more durable than brass  must fall to the ground like common brick or clay were men to make no allowance for the continual revolutions of manners and customs and would admit nothing but what was suitable to the prevailing fashion Must we throw aside the pictures of our ancestors because of their ruffs and fardingales But where the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another and where vicious manners are described without being marked with the proper characters of blame and disapprobation this must be allowed to disfigure the poem and to be a real deformity I cannot nor is it proper I should enter into such sentiments and however I may excuse the poet on account of the manners of his age I never can relish the composition The want of humanity and of decency so conspicuous in the characters drawn by several of the antient poets even sometimes by  Homer  and the  Greek  tragedians diminishes considerably the merit of their noble performances and gives modern authors a great advantage over them We are not interested in the fortunes and sentiments of such rough heroes We are displeased to find the limits of vice and virtue so  confounded And whatever indulgence we may give the writer on account of his prejudices we cannot prevail on ourselves to enter into his sentiments or bear an affection to characters which we plainly discover to be blameable  THE case is not the same with moral principles as with speculative opinions of any kind These are in continual flux and revolution The son embraces a different system from the father Nay there scarce is any man who can boast of great constancy and uniformity in this particular Whatever speculative errors may be found in the polite writings of any age or country they detract but little from the value of those compositions There needs but a certain turn of thought or imagination to make us enter into all the opinions which then prevailed and relish the sentiments or conclusions derived from them But a very violent effort is requisite to change our judgment of manners and excite sentiments of approbation or blame love or hatred different from those to which the mind from long custom has been familiarized And where a man is confident of the rectitude of that moral standard by which he judges he is justly jealous of it and will not pervert the sentiments of his heart for a moment in complaisance to any writer whatever  OF all speculative errors those which regard religion are the most excusable in compositions of genius nor is it ever permitted to judge of the civility or wisdom of any people or even of single persons by the grossness or refinement of their theological principles The same good sense that directs men in the ordinary occurrences of life is not hearkened to in religious matters which are supposed to be placed entirely above the cognizance of human reason Upon this account all the absurdities of the pagan system of theology must be overlooked by every critic who would pretend to form a just notion of antient poetry and our posterity in their turn must have the same indulgence to their forefathers No religious principles can ever be imputed as a fault to any poet while they remain merely principles and take not such strong possession of his heart as to lay him under the imputation of  bigotry  or  superstition  Where that happens they confound the sentiments of morality and alter the natural boundaries of vice and virtue They are therefore eternal blemishes according to the principle abovementioned nor are the prejudices and false opinions of the age sufficient to justify them  'Tis essential to the  Roman  catholic religion to inspire a violent hatred to every other worship and represent all pagaus mahometans and heretics as the objects of divine wrath and vengeance Such sentiments though they are in reality extremely blameable are considered as virtues by the zealots of that communion and are represented in their tragedies and epic poems as a kind of divine heroism This bigotry has disfigured two very fine tragedies of the  French  theatre  Polieucte  and  Athalia  where an intemperate zeal for particular modes of worship is set off with all the pomp imaginable and forms the predominant character of the heroes  "What is this"  says the heroic  Joad  to  Josabet  finding her in discourse with  Mattan  the priest of  Baal  "Does the daughter of  David  speak to this traitor Are you not afraid left the earth should open and pour forth flames to devour you both Or that these holy walls should fall and crush you together What is his purpose Why comes that enemy of God hither to poison the air which we breath with his horrid presence"  Such sentiments are received with great applause on the theatre of  Paris  but at  London  the spectators would be full as much pleased to hear  Achilles  tell  Agamemnon  that he  was a dog in his forehead and a deer in his heart or  Jupiter  threaten  Juno  with a sound drubbing if she will not be quiet  RELIGIOUS principles are also a blemish in any polite composition when they rise up to superstition and intrude themselves into every sentiment however remote from any connection with religion 'Tis no excuse for the poet that the customs of his country had burthened life with so many religious ceremonies and observances that no part of it was exempt from that yoak It must be for ever ridiculous in  Petrarch  to compare his mistress  Laura  to  Jesus Christ  Nor is it less ridiculous in that agreeable libertine  Boccace  very seriously to give thanks to God Almighty and the ladies for their assistance in desending him against his enemies  FINIS  ERRATA  P L r  set  P L r  be buried  P L r  conditions  P L from the Bottom read  foretel the issue  P L read  corrupt
