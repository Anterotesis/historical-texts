 THE OPINION OF A Known Dissenter On the BILL for  Preventing Occasional Conformity  WHAT is the publick Possession of Places or Offices of Trust in a Government to the Case of Religion They who separate from the Communion of a Church cannot in reason expect to be entertained in the Service of that very Church And they that separate from the Church ought to consider  Places  and  Offices  beforehand and to examine whether they can forego them for their  Consciences  or not and if they did so they would not be so frequently foregoing their  Consciences  to possess them a  Gain  And I cannot but wonder at and condemn the Injustice of such  Dissenters  who would have those People to whose Communion they cannot or will not join receive them into equal Advantages of  Honour  and  Profit  of  Trust  and  Management  in the Politick Concern  I cannot approve the equity of it nor I would not have the  Dissenters  covet it nor had they the  Government  in their hands would they admit it themselves  This coveting  Offices  of  Trust Honour  and  Profit  in the Government has been the cause of that  Occasional Compliance  which to the Dishonour and Shame of the  Dissenters  has Branded them with too much Levity in Religion  For whoever dissents from an Establish'd Church on any account but from a real Principle of  Conscience  is a  Politick  not a  Religious Dissenter  Nothing can be Lawful and Unlawful at the same time If it be not Lawful for me to Dissent I ought to Conform but if it be Unlawful for me to Conform I must Dissent and he that cannot Die or at least desire to do so rather than Conform ought to Conform  If I shall Dissent and yet at the same time Conform by  Conforming  I deny my  Dissent  being Lawful or by my  Dissenting  I damn my  Conforming  as sinful  An Act of Parliament is of every Mans own doing and therefore 'tis just every Man should comply with the Terms or suffer the Penalty but here is no Penalty if no Crime and if no Preferments are sought no Honours accepted there is no Crime if Selfdenial was as practicable as Selfadvancement here is no need of  Occasional Conformity  for all such do seek the Crime that is the first Sin then Mortgage their  Consciences  to avoid the Penalty and so add one Sin to another  No Man can be said to separate from and join to a thing at the same time if your Conscience is satisfy'd in joining it cannot be satisfy'd in separating unless you can suppose your Conscience to be satisfy'd and dissatisfy'd both together  A Man passively Religious that can Communicate any where may from the same Principle and with far less guilt Communicate no where for he has prostituted the little Religion he had if ever he had any to his Interest  No  Occasional Conformist  can be receiv'd into Communion in any  Dissenting Assembly  upon any other Terms than as a  Penitent  for this Practice is prepostrous excentrick and destructive of the very Foundation of the  Dissenters  Principles  Methinks Men should seem what they are if a Man dissent from the Church let him do so and his Principle being wellgrounded for such Dissent let him hold it if not wellgrounded let him leave it if he cannot suffer one way let him suffer another and why should we not be as honest to God as our Country  'Tis an intolerable Affront to the  Church of England  reflecting upon its  Doctrine  as well as  Practice  to make use of the  Church  for a  Cover  to fence them against the Laws at the same time continuing to Disown its  Communion  as a thing not fit to be continued in  Conformity  and  Nonconformity  at the same time in one and the same Person for a Secular End to save a penalty and privately and then as being asham'd of it to go back and sit down as not having done it at all are Contradictions I must insist upon and rather wish than expect to see rectify'd  He who dissents from the Establish'd Church except from true Principles of Conscience is guilty of a great Sin  He who Conforms to the Establish'd Church against his Conscience is guilty of a great Sin  He who both Dissents and Conforms at the same time and in the same point of Religion must be guilty of one of these great Sins  And he who has committed either of these Sins ought not to be receiv'd again on either side on any other Terms than a  Penitent  As to  Partial Conformity  Dissent in some things and Conforming in others does not seem to concern this Case no Man among the  Dissenters  pretended to dissent in every thing but we are speaking of conforming in those very Points in which we dissent and that no less than the  Article of Communion  If Gentlemen who have such a Latitude in their Opinions wou'd not have it thought they are moved to it by their Interests let them practise it openly and not Time it so to the every  Eve  of an Election as to have it speak of it self and as it were force Men to believe it done on purpose nay let them not put such a Reproach in the Mouths of their Enemies as to have it spoken in contempt with circumstances that stop the Mouths of Argument and are as Convincing as Demonstration  'Tis not a light thing to shift and change Communion with an Establish'd and with a Separate Church as often as convenience or Reason of State or Interest invite  As to the Excuse that is made That this is no  Conformity  in Point of Religion but done as a Civil Action in Obedience to the Laws of the Land as a Qualification for admittance into Publick Employments which they think it their Duty to accept in order to Serve their Country are not Sacraments Religious Acts Are they not the same thing tho' differently Administred in the Establish'd and in the Dissenting Church And how can you take it as a Civil Action in one place and a Religious Act in another This is playing  Bo peep  with God Almighty and no Man can tell when they are about a Civil Action and when about a Religious And if the Service of their Country be so dear to them pray why should they not undergo the Penalties and chuse to expose their Bodies and Estates for that Service rather than their Souls These are Patriots indeed that will damn their Souls to save their Country For as hath been observ'd  Conformity  is a Sinful Act in a  Dissenter  or else his dissenting before and after must be a Sinful Act and he has no Excuse unless it be that he was convinc'd and reconvinc'd and then convinc'd again  After description of true  Protestant Dissenters  who cannot conform he proceeds in this manner If there are crept into their Company  StateDissenters  or  PolitickDissenters  they are not of them and we wish they would go out from them I see no Act of Parliament a making to the prejudice of this  Dissenter  This is the  Dissenter  to which Her Majesty has promis'd her Protection The Act against  Occasional Conformity  does not concern us I dare undertake not one  Dissenter  offer'd to present a Petition to the Honourable House against its passing they who can conform for one Reason may conform without two and ought to conform And we are therefore content to be distinguish'd who cannot conform at all if we have any Knaves amongst us take them if we have any Hypocrites any who can conform and do not we are free to part with them that the remainder may be all such as agree with the true Character of a  Conscientious Dissenter  'Tis plain that  Occasional Communion  is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a  Dissenter  who if he can conform ought to conform and if he can for a Place of Preferment ought to do it without the Preferment  It is an Act destructive of all possible pretence for dissenting and never was nor never can be defended by any  Dissenter  without overthrowing all the Reasons they could ever give for dissenting How then can this Bill be aim'd at the  Dissenters  We hold it to be a Novelty an Abuse crept in amongst us and we are glad to have it condemn'd by Authority We are so content with the suppressing the grievance of this scandalous Ambidexter  Conformity  that we think the Hardships put upon us with it not worth the naming  All the Parliaments that ever were or will be can never suppress any thing amongst us so scandalous to our Reputation and to that Candour with which we desire to guide our Actions nor so contrary to and destructive of the very Nature of our separating from the  Church of England  and the Constitution of all our Collected Congregations and therefore if these  Occasional Conformists  would accept of the Friendly Advice of their Brethren it should be That they would for the future conform to the  Church of England  As for his Authority to write thus in the Name of the  Dissenters  he alledges that he hath the General Concurrence of all the  Dissenters  he ever convers'd with that Publication is an Appeal to the World and if he hath affirm'd any thing in the Name of the  Dissenters  which is not their Opinion he is liable to an easie Confutation  Truth  says he  is a General Commission and any Man may write it  He modestly conceals his Name that his Reasons might not come clogg'd with the dead weight of the Meanness and Imperfections of the Author The  Occasional Conformity  of  Dissenters  says he is not Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors on either side but by Truth Scripture and Reason and so far as that is on his side he thinks it ought not to be despis'd for being usher'd in by an Unworthy Instrument  LONDON  Printed and are to be sold by  J Nutt  near  Stationers Hall
