AN ODE  THE naked grove now shivers at the blast  While his green mantle on the ground is cast  Bleak are the prospects of the widow'd trees  Mourning their faded glories in the breeze  Hark where the barns conceal their yellow stores  Echo repeats the labour of the floors  Like a young thresher on the neighbouring hill  Her mimic strokes the distant woodlands fill  Now in the Scorpion Phoebus rules the day  And Summer's painted foliage fades away  Shorn is the verdure of the hazelshade  While the gale brushes o'er the auburn glade  Now ye autumnal beauties mourn the time  Mispent in prudery while you pass'd your prime  And ere the the plum is of its blue bereft  Be frugal of the golden hour that's left  Yon stately pine late triumph'd in its shade  But mark in Autumn how its honours fade  The skies prophetic of stern Winter wear  A sadder robeand nipping is the air  Now to the thirsty root the sap descends  Tho' still the bough with golden fruitage bends  Still the hale jasmine boasts its white and green  And annuals triumph o'er the withering scene  Now teem the cydervats with applewine  And emulate the nectar of the vine  While ripe Pomona labours to produce  A cooling beverage for the Summer's use  The fervor of the heated swain to cool  While the proud dogstar holds his tyrantrule  Will Myra from her plighted promise range  Shall Love's affections with the weather change  No tho' around dismantled forests pine  And the gay fields their velvet gloss resign  Reverse of Autumn she shall never fade  But ardent Truth embower us with its shade  THE FALL OF THE LEAF  We all do fade as a leaf  ISAIAH  SEE the leaves around us falling  Dry and wither'd to the ground  Thus to thoughtless mortals calling  In a sad and solemn sound  " Sons of Adam once in Eden  " 'Till like us he blighted fell  " Hear the lecture we are reading  " 'Tis alas the truth we tell  " Virgins much too much presuming  " On your boasted white and red  " View us late in beauty blooming  " Number'd now among the dead  " Griping misers nightly waking  " See the end of all your care  " Fled on wings of our own making  " We have left our owners bare  " Sons of honour sed on praises  " Fluttering high in fancied worth  " Lo the fickle air that raises  " Brings us down to parent earth  " Learned sophs in systems jaded  " Who for new ones daily call  " Cease at length by us persuaded  " Every leaf must have its fall  " Youths tho' yet no losses grieve you  " Gay in health and manly grace  " Let not cloudless skies deceive you  " Summer gives to Autumn place  " Venerable sires grown hoary  " Hither turn th' unwilling eye  " Think amidst your falling glory  " Autumn tells a Winter nigh  " Yearly in our course returning  " Messengers of shortest stay  " Thus we preach this truth concerning  " Heaven and earth shall pass away"  " On the tree of life eternal  " Man let all thy hopes be stay'd  " Which alone for ever vernal  " Bears a leaf that shall not fade"  THE DECLINE OF AUTUMN  BY WW  THE bosom of earth is all matted with leaves  The honours of Autumn decay  Brown Ceres no longer exhibits her sheaves  To the goldeneyed monarch of day  With dissonant guns hills and vallies resound  The swains thro' the coppices rove  The partridges bleed on the arable ground  The pheasants lie dead in the grove  The coats of the hedges look languidly green  The swallows relinquish the meads  Rude winter approaches with horrible mien  The flowrets give place to the weeds  The sun too is lazy and slumbers abed  As loathing so early to rise  When risen how dim looks his vapoury head  How faint he illumines the skies  No more on the poles hang the clustering hops  Or form a magnificent shade  No more on their skirts shine the showery drops  For Autumn their nurse is decay'd  The gale that was wont to approach me so kind  Grows sharp and flies hastily by  To give me sweet kisses no longer inclin'd  It bids the tear start from my eye  O see while I speak from the gun's levell'd aim  Death pierces the birds of the air  Ye rovers will nothing your conduct reclaim  And move your hard bosoms to spare  No nothingye cry with unanimous voice  While ridicule falls from your tongue  Ye think not ye cruel ones as ye rejoice  How once the poor innocents sung  To others such barbarous sports I resign  And fly to my Florimel's arms  Her sanctified love shall be totally mine  For virtue adds force to her charms  On the base of religion my fair let it rise  To crown us with blessings 'twas given  To bid our souls mount from the earth to the skies  And give us a foretaste of heaven  A FAREWELL TO SUMMER AN ELEGY  ADieu fair spring adorn'd with chaplets gay  Ye fields and vernal landscapes all adieu  Bright summer and the long transparent day  No more I hail the scented groves and you  Farewell the walk where crystal rivulets glide  Where slender osiers waft the healthful gale  Where insects float along the silver tide  And silent rapture haunts the fruitful vale  Where purple lawns salubrious odours spread  Where heathshrubs blossom wild with languid dye  Where round the hedge unbought perfumes are shed  And native beauty courts the roving eye  Where hawthorns bud and velvet cowslips grow  Where verdant banks put forth the painted weed  Whose vivid hues eclipse th' embroider'd beau  And the proud flaunters of the Park exceed  Where Solitude unfolds her matchless charms  And meek Content assumes her happy reign  Where jocund Plenty crowns the rising farms  And fills the storehouse of the villageswain  How fresh past pleasures dance before the mind  Renew'd in thought by winter's coming train  That now like vapours on the broadwing'd wind  Haste to deface the beauty of the plain  I see with memory's retrospective eye  Each rivulet's polish'd current smoothly flow  See blithsome May hang pearly blossoms high  And richly dress the flowery meads below  See nodding orchards wave their plumy pride  See gardens grac'd with all the tints of spring  Enamell'd beds their tender foliage hide  'Till genial suns a warmer season bring  What scenes can equal summer's bright display  When swift Aurora drives her early car  When glowing Phoebus gives the blushing day  And sends his boundless influence wide and far  How sweet to see the flocks that crop their food  And skip in wanton sport around the field  Glad to present their bleating gratitude  For the green pasture that the meadows yield  To hear the wakeful shepherd's homely strain  Breathe welcome sonnets to the rosy beam  While slumbering towns in leaden sleep remain  And lose substantial pleasures for a dream  To tread betimes the neighbouring lanes and view  Ere scorching heat rides on the noontide air  The grass the trees the vallies rob'd in dew  And garden plants the liquid garment wear  There oft at morn I tun'd the rural lay  And with my Sylvia gently stray'd along  The birds sat mute on every leafy spray  While listening echo catch'd the flowing song  There silent mus'd on Shakespear's tragic page  Of Milton learn'd to scale the azure road  Chanted Maeonides' poetic rage  And read O Pope thy equal thoughts of God  Admir'd great Thomson's active skilful muse  That in such easy numbers scans the globe  Such lively colours Albion's spring renews  And paints the beauties of her vernal robe  There when the lark began her warbling song  And shook her pinions for the morning flight  Rais'd the loud chorus of the feather'd throng  And tower'd beyond the farthest reach of sight  The tuneful blackbird whistling to his mate  Far o'er the lonely forest thrill'd the note  And cheerful linnets in the woods elate  Rejoin'd the melting music of his throat  Our praise reap'd fervor from the general glow  The pious airs inspir'd the heavenly flame  The thrush's plaint the cattle's meaning low  With grateful joy our swelling hearts o'ercame  Nor less at eve the rural mansions please  Or rural virtues charm th' exalted soul  Whose powers not yet enervated by ease  Like Newton grasp creation's ample whole  In search of learning's gifts unwearied roam  Th' illumin'd spaces of the milky way  Traverse th' infinitude of nature's dome  The earth its snowtop'd mountains and the sea  In every part discover wisdom's hand  Find Deity inscrib'd on all around  Omnipotence and love from strand to strand  Far as th' encircling ocean's utmost bound  For such O spring thy fragrant breezes blow  Thy newborn flowers expand the crimson leaf  Thy rays O summer golden prospects show  And tinge the grain of Ceres' pointed sheaf  For such mild autumn rears the shooting vines  Bids juicy clusters swarm the shaded wall  Enriching crops o'erhang her wheaten mines  And ripen'd fruits from bending branches fall  To such even winter's jarring winds convey  The gladsome tidings of eternal peace  And storms and clouds that others bliss allay  Their hope their strength their fortitude increase  A FAREWELL TO THE COUNTRY  WRITTEN THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER  ADieu the pleasing rural scene  Thick shades and meadows fair and green  The field adorn'd with sheaves of corn  The walk at early hour of morn  Behold with green no meads are clad  Behold the thrush sits mute and sad  No lively songster's warbling throat  Pours joy pours music in his note  How bare how naked seems yon bed  The pink is gone the tulip dead  Where is the gay the odorous flower  That lately blush'd in yonder bower  So fade the glories of the year  They blossom fair and disappear  And melancholy truth fond man  Thy life's a flower thy days a span  Almighty Sovereign bounteous Power  Whom every clime and tongue adore  Whose wisdom this vast system plann'd  And form'd the sea and form'd the land  Prostrate before thy throne we bow  Parent of circling seasons Thou  Hasten far happier daysand bring  " One glorious and eternal spring"  ON SEEING A ROSE IN OCTOBER  THrice happy flower what heavenly aid  Supports thy strength while others fade  What quickening spirit makes thee blow  While all thy sisters droop below  Sure there's a spark of heavenly flame  That shoots its warmth throughout thy frame  Some inborn essence most refin'd  Some genial virtue good and kind  That makes thy blushing beauties blow  And thy mellifluous sweets to flow  That gives new life and rears thy head  When all thy beauteous race lie dead  Thou charming rose art now most rare  And would'st be quite beyond compare  But that my Delia but that she  Is lovely fair and sweet like thee  Like thee when other beauties pine  She glows with virtue and shall shine  Deep in the heart the blessing lies  The spark divine that never dies  Which when the frost of age invades  When on her cheek thy picture fades  Shall give new grace new life new air  And make her eminently fair  ON THE DEATH OF DR PARNE FELLOW OF TRIN COL CAM  AT length poor suffering wretch thy pangs are o'er  Death seals thy eyes and thou shalt groan no more  No more shall misery reach thy tortur'd breast  Nor life's low cares disturb thy settled rest  From pride ambition envy malice free  Thou feel'st no more the gripes of penury  Nor all the thousand pains of sad mortality  Yet sure some decent honours to thy shade  From learning's sons some tribute might be paid  In the last office might there not have been  Some added grace to solemnize the scene  The doctor was buried in the college chapel It is usual on the death of any Fellow to carry an empty bier with a pall over it round the Quadrangle the Choir walking before it and all the members of the society behind Verses on the deceased are usually fixed to the pall and thrown into the graveBut these ceremonies were omitted  Some plaintive Muse to deck thy empty bier  Some pitying friend to drop the tender tear  But foes pursued thee to thy latest breath  And malice left thee not a friend in death  One eye alone I saw with sorrow flow  In artless full simplicity of woe  The faithful  A country boy that waited on the Doctor who was observed to cry all the time  rustic wept and only he  Reproach'd the croud for lost humanity  Despis'd unfelt for unlamented lay  In the rude grave th' unanimated clay  And yet this trampled corse had once a name  Once was no stranger to the voice of fame  This thing despis'd was once with genius fir'd  Nay by the adverse Bentley was admir'd  'Midst Granta's sons but lately fill'd the chair  Graceful as when her Whalley's self was there  Foe to himself alone his open mind  Embrac'd and lov'd and would have serv'd mankind  But niggard Fortune acts by partial rules  And oft her bounty showers on knaves and fools  Once she could smile on him with glimmering ray  But clouded o'er the evening of his day  In life's decline no healing comfort gave  But sunk his soul with sorrow to the grave  By hopes too sanguine led he met the fate  Of all who seek the rich and trust the great  He went he bow'd he heard and he believ'd  Was courted flatter'd promis'dand deceiv'd  Find we then most to pity or to blame  Shall we reward with praise or brand with shame  If livelier parts to venial faults betray  Must censure wipe his merits quite away  If meagre want with deep affliction join'd  Subdue the reason and unhinge the mind  Shall we officious every blot reveal  And judge him with uncharitable zeal  Or kindly weep for Nature thus decay'd  And o'er his failings cast a friendly shade  To future ages bid his virtues bloom  And bury all his follies in the tomb    FABLES FOR GROWN GENTLEMEN  BY JHS ESQ WRITTEN IN MDCCLXI  FABLE I THE RIVER WITH A PETITION  ACcording to the Romish creed  I speak of Rome two thousand years ago  The life that they suppos'd the Gods to lead  You would not chuse to undergo  Jupiter's business day and night  Was to attend with open ears and eyes  And to write down as fast as he could write  All the impertinence that men devise  Besides mens fopperies and ravings  The women had so great a share  That their absurdities and cravings  Omnipotence alone could bear  And furthermore to try his patience  He heard the prayers and fanciful distresses  Of all his children and relations  And of his wife and his mistresses  Once on a time if you'll believe tradition  A river in great tribulation  To Jupiter presented a petition  With an expostulating exhortation  Whereby if the petitioner's refus'd  He has a right to think himself illus'd  A form of prayer contriv'd for execution  Exactly like a doublebarrell'd gun  Which if you fire with resolution  You have another chance when one is done  So far from killing two birds with one stone  An art that's very little known  All the petitioner desir'd to do  Was to kill one with two  Now this petition shew'd how the petitioner  For his fidelity zeal and devotion  Had been appointed a commissioner  Of the revenues of the Ocean  Which he collected with great pains  And sent in good and current cash  But for his trouble and clear gains  The Sea return'd adulterated trash  Wherefore he pray'd  Exhorted and submitted  That all the sums the Ocean paid  Shall for the future be remitted  And issued fair  Without debasement or impair  Ungrateful Thames the God replied  Without that mixture and alloy  Which the Sea pours into thee every tide  Thy beauty and thy strength would wear away  Without his aid thou wouldst remain  Like Tiber or the poor pretending Seine  Led thro' parterres or rolled down a cascade  Confin'd to vanity and lost to trade  'Tis thus the Highlander complains  'Tis thus the Union they abuse  For binding their backsides in chains  And shackling their feet in shoes  For giving them both food and fewel  And comfortable cloaths  Instead of cruel oatmeal gruel  Instead of rags and heritable blows  Luxury every day grows stronger  The Highland fair  Beholds her lover now no longer  Trotting with his buttocks bare  Thus Doctor Brown was taken with the spleen  And fancied we were all undone  Raving about a carpet and a screen  And out of temper with the sun  Because it is a crime  As he supposes  For men to run in winter time  Into the sun to warm their noses  'Tis an egregious want of sense  A want of taste and want of shame  To fancy universal affluence  And luxury the same  In spite of Doctor Brown's discerning  The term of universal will agree  As well with his benevolence and learning  As universal suit with luxury  He may perceive if he be so inclin'd  Like his discernment luxury's confin'd  For as the gout torments the hands and feet  To ease the nobler stomach and the head  So luxury to gratify the great  Insults and robs the labourer of his bread  Luxury in a state is a disease  Because 'tis partial and obstructed wealth  But universal affluence and ease  Is universal happiness and health  FABLE II THE PHOENIX AND HER LOVERS  THat every female's a coquette  I could as safely swear upon a book  As I could safely bet  That every Frenchman is a cook  A Phoenix daughter of the Sun  Chaste as a Vestal modest as a Nun  Added such merit to her birth  That not a bird tho' of the highest fashion  No feather'd coxcomb of the earth  Ventur'd to declare his passion  They all agreed  No earthly bird was worthy of her love  None but a bird of the celestial breed  An angel from above  The Phoenix liv'd so long a maid  'Till all her gaiety and bloom  Began to fade  And savour of the tomb  She mop'd grew splenetic and tir'd  Of so much awe and so much state  Se long'd like other birds to be admir'd  Like other birds she long'd to find a mate  At last she issued out a proclamation  To summon the male birds of every nation  Perhaps this summons and this longing  Was a political machine  Just like the lovers that came thronging  Summon'd by our virgin queen  Now from all quarters  The birds appear'd in their best cloaths  Nobles in stars and garters  Curled and embroider'd beaux  Some stately others light and gay  One cooed another sung and flatter'd  Some like the Magpie and the Jay  For ever chatter'd  About the inner ring  Where all the birds of figure press  A bat whirl'd round with leathern wing  To show his shape and his address  Offering his heart his eyes and wings to boot  At which there rose an universal hoot  The Phoenix answer'd in the tone  And in the selfsame manner languish'd  As queen Elizabeth when she was shown  A taylor by her beauty vanquish'd  Take courage man says she  For if I needs must have a taylor  I promise without failure  To marry none but thee  And as the queen coquetted at an age  When other queens are tame  'Till she went off the stage  The Phoenix did the same  She died a great coquette and what is more  Rose from the grave a greater than before  The Phoenix and selflove are the same beast  Within the human breast  Which poets feign the spicy east  She builds her solitary nest  From whence with every gale of wind  The traveller may smell the mind  Her lovers are our passions these she meets  Either by appointment or by chance  Which if she can't indulge she treats  With smiles and complaisance  And as the Phoenix from her ashes rais'd  Returns as blooming as a bride  So when we think it dies the Lord be prais'd  Selflove springs up again with double pride  'Tis a determin'd case  None but ourselves can occupy our place  For this same reason physical and clear  Each individual of us all  Is that same Phoenix without any peer  On this terrestrial ball  A Lover is a madman and a miser  Not one jot wiser  Let any try except a lover  Or one devoted to his pelf  Whether in all the world they can discover  Another self  FABLE III THE DUCKLINGS AND THE WISE BIRDS  A Hen one evening to enjoy the cool  Was walking with a brood of ducklings callow  Just like a mistress of a boardingschool  With misses green and yellow  As she was tutoring and schooling  This bird fot loitering and that for fooling  Behold a fishpond so alluring  That spite of her remonstrances and cackle  They ventur'd their whole stock without ensuring  Trusting to their oars and tackle  The hen kept scolding like a drab  Cursing her rebellious race  We're not thy children cried a pert young squab  If we were chickens we should have more grace  On Nature we depend  Our course she steers  Nature's a safer guide and better friend  Than any dotard's fears  Close by the pond an antient tower  Lifted its venerable head  A college and sequester'd bower  Where owls for ages had been bred  An old professor a great clerk  Taught them their talents to display  To keep their eyes wide open in the dark  And shut them in the face of day  To think abstractedly to reason deep  And to declaim 'till all the world's asleep  These students from the tower saw our young folks  Our bold adventurers under sail  They heard their clamorous mirth and jokes  And heard their nurse's fruitless wail  Observe says one more learned than the rest  These birds by instinct know the season  To sail to eat to go to rest  Just as we know by argument and reason  We know from reason and experience both  We see it every hour  That governors are loth  To part with power  Yon hen which you all hear  In such a fright  Undoubtedly affects that fear  To keep her pupils always in her sight  From the same principle for the same end  Our tutor keeps us all thus pen'd  Preaching that we must not pretend to fly  We are too weak it is too soon  Which I'll demonstrate to be a lye  As clear as the sun at noon  Feet said the subtle Owl  Are not the things  That constitute the essence of a fowl  So much as wings  Whatever is essential to our make  We soonest learn and seldomest mistake  Hence that pathetic prayer that tender call  By which we get our wants dispatch'd  Is so essential above all  That we all speak the moment we are hatch'd  Nature benevolent and wise  Opens our mouths much sooner than our eyes  By parity of reason meet  Our wings and pinions should be ready  Long time before our heads and feet  Are firm and steady  Therefore 'twill follow like a chain  That as we walk you must confess  With little giddiness and pain  If we attempt it we must fly with less  This reasoning philosophic wight  Convinc'd his brethren one and all  With one accord they took their flight  And fatal and untimely was their fall  None of them reason'd any more  The young logicians lay like wrecks  Drown'd in the pond or scatter'd on the shore  With mangled limbs and broken necks  Bred in a court or some gay city  The ducklings are those thoughtless spritely fools  O Cambridge is it not a pity  Strangers to thee and to thy schools  FABLE IV LA NOBLESSE DE FRANCE THE FIGHTING COCK AND THE CRAVEN  A Cock an officer of foot  In France retir'd into a village  Where he did nought but crow and strut  And live by pillage  Whene'er he had a mind  To take his pastime with the fair  He was not to one wife confin'd  Nor to a pair  But like a lord  Had half a dozen both at bed and board  He spied a barndoor fowl one day  Cram'd from the rump up to the gullet  In amorous dalliance and play  With a young pullet  His robes and train his senatorial cap  His size almost the size of geese  Show'd that he had been nurtur'd in the lap  Of peace  Bred for the bench and presidental chair  He judg'd he roosted and digested there  The military cock took as much pleasure  As an unlucky page  To see the magistrate employ his leisure  So much below his dignity and age  He that should set a good example  Be virtuous and discreet  To tread on modesty and trample  Chastity beneath his feet  Fine times says he when judges run  Seducing maidens in the open sun  This wanton fit  Comes of intemperance and overeating  Which as it soon will bring you to the spit  Shall save your reverence from a beating  To this reproof  With a sly sneer the judge replied aloof  'Tis true that I and all my brood  When we have run the race assign'd  Shall have the honour to become the food  And comfort of mankind  An unexpected death  Shall gently steal not force away our breath  Good colonel you are mightily mistaken  It is not owing to respect in deed  That you are neither boil'd like us with bacon  Roasted nor fricasseed  But tho' your flesh be men's aversion  Yet it contributes much to their diversion  They give you barley bread and oats  Because they take great pleasure and delight  To see you fight  To see you cutting one another's throats  If you escape and are not slain in war  You are in a worse plight by far  Amongst the hogs  Wounded and lame you're on a dunghill cast  By wanton boys and puppy dogs  Worried or teaz'd to death at last  In France the landtax is not as 'tis here  A tax where you appeal and squabble  There the nobility go free and clear  Like the rascality and rabble  The same exemption pards and tygers own  And the base polecat caught in gins  Their flesh and bone we let alone  And ask them nothing but their skins  FABLE V THE DOG AND THE CAT  INterest fascinates both age and youth  And with a glance of her bewitching eye  Can make a minister speak truth  Or make a mighty monarch tell a lye  She can set brothers by the ears  And what you'll scarce believe perhaps  Make sisters as harmonious as the spheres  And live together without pulling caps  'Tis she gives every one her place  Oft like a blundering marshal at a feast  Joining a scoundrel to his grace  An atheist to a priest  Interest well understood  Made Solomon makes Melcomb now declare  That life is only good  To eat and drink and laugh and banish care  Close by a kitchen fire a dog and cat  Each a famous politician  Were meditating as they sat  Plans and projects of ambition  By the same fire were set to warm  Fragments of their master's dinner  Temptations to alarm  The frailty of a sinner  Clear prurient water stream'd from Pompey's jaws  And Tabby look'd demure and lick'd her paws  And as two plenipos  For fear of a surprise  When both have something to propose  Examine one another's eyes  Or like two maids tho' smit by different swains  In jealous conference o'er a dish of tea  Pompey and Tabby both cudgell'd their brains  Studying each other's physiognomy  Pompey endow'd with finer sense  Discover'd in a cast of Tabby's face  A symptom of concupiscence  Which made it a clear case  When strait applying to the dawning passion  Pompey address'd her in this fashion  Both you and I with vigilance and zeal  Becoming faithful dogs and pious cats  Have guarded day and night this commonweal  From robbery and rats  All that we get for this heaven knows  Is a few bones and many blows  Let us no longer fawn and whine  Since we have talents and are able  Let us impose an equitable fine  Upon our master's table  And to be brief  Let us each chuse a single dish  I'll be contented with roast beef  Take you that turbotyou love fish  Thus every dog and cat agrees  When they can settle their own fees  Thus two contending chiefs are seen  To agree at last in every measure  One takes the management of the marine  The other of the nation's treasure  Thus Lg retir'd thus even Pt  His popularity resign'd  For a tidbit  A pittance suited to the patriot's mind  FABLE VI THE SPIDER AND THE FLY  WIth malice fell  A spider watch'd within his cell  Ready to sally  The unwary traveller to souse  Like a Jewbroker in the Alley  Or a Dutch merchant in his countinghouse  Like them he corresponded far and near  And tho' his trade was intricate and dark  He manag'd his affairs and kept all clear  Without a partner or a clerk  A petit maitre an active bustling fly  Thinking to scamper unmolested  With airy equipage as he pass'd by  By cruel Cacus was arrested  Furnish'd with that undaunted sense  Which only courts and camps can teach  Having no weapon or defence  Except his instrument of speech  The fly with flattering soporific strains  Tried to benumb the spider's brains  Hearing such daily praise bestow'd  Upon your elegance in weaving  I came to visit your abode  Which is magnificent beyond believing  And now I am convinc'd if you will drop  The linen trade  And take to weaving velvets and brocade  The salladeaters soon must shut up shop  Change but your diet and like their's your taste  Will grow refin'd correct and chaste  As I have studied every herb and leaf  That's either noxious or good to eat  Make me your caterer in chief  And pourveyor of all your meat  Send me this instant in a trice  I'll bring you something savoury and nice  Seeing the spider smile and grin  He found his plot would not succeed  It was too thin  For one of that sagacious breed  On which he fell a vapouring and buzzing  Swearing the drones would take the alarm  And come to the assistance of their cousin  With an enormous swarm  The drones and I are no such strangers  We know said Cacus what we both can do  They are too wise to run their heads in dangers  For such a busy meddling fool as you  But since you come to spoil our manufacture  And poison honest traders  I'll hang you like a malefactor  To terrify invaders  No sooner said than done  He knock'd him down and hung him in the sun  The spider's a negotiator  And an ensnaring captious debater  Obdurate subtile and alert  The fly a coxcomb and a prater  Teazing and pert  Tho' all such characters I hate  And from my soul despise  May we have many spiders in the state  When we are plagued with French and Spanish flies  FABLE VII THE WILD DUCKS AND THE WATER SPANIEL  AFter a tedious flight  Of many a stormy day and night  A flock of wild ducks sailing up and down  Upon a lake were making merry  Like sailors in a seaport town  Just arriv'd from Pondicherry  A swan too stately for sport  To shew herself was all her view  Had undertaken to escort  The jovial crew  Swelling and bridling  With all the airs of a fine dame at court  Turning about and sidling  Advancing and then stopping short  Displaying in her features  Contempt and insolent dejection  To signify that those strange creatures  Were forc'd upon her for protection  I must confess amongst mankind  I have seen swans as foolishly inclin'd  At Paris on the Seine  I've seen a French marquee conduct a pair  Of German barons to the fair  Of Saint Germaine  Strutting before them tossing up his head  Then looking back and lowering his crest  The barons were so aukward so illbred  And so illdress'd  Have you not seen a newmade peer  With equal pride but greater trepidations  Observing in his rear  A troop of country relations  Run up Saint James'sstreet and at two leaps  Take Arthur's steps  Those steps as terrible as the Tarpeian  From whence with one black ball you're hurl'd  Into another world  Amongst the damn'd Plebeian  Perhaps this grave and solemn swan  Dislik'd the company of those wildducks  Just as a prude or sober man  Dislikes the company of bucks  For while they made more noise and riot  Than twenty justices of peace  The swan was serious and quiet  As captain Gander marching with his geese  Marching to the field  With gorget and a wooden shield  About the middle of the lake  Upon the banks a waterspaniel lay  Looking out for duck or drake  Or any lawful prey  And as the captain of a privateer  Lies by  Nor offers to bear down nor gives a cheer  'Till his expected prize begins to fly  Close to the shore the spaniel let them sail  And rush'd into the lake when they turn'd tail  Snorting and snoring  Pursuing them with all his force  Swearing and roaring  'Till he was hoarse  He turn'd and veer'd  Now made a stretch and then a tack  Now snapp'd and now they disappear'd  And rose again a long way back  'Till the poor spiritless exhausted brute  Was forc'd to give up the pursuit  And as the French to Toulon ran  And left the Spaniards in a scrape  The moment that the fray began  The swan made her escape  Quite out of reach  A roan duck on the beach  Under a shed  Consider'd the whole scene with wonder  Just like Caligula under the bed  Studying the cause of lightning and thunder  As the victorious crew pass'd by in order  He made them an oration  The roan duck being the recorder  Or burgomaster of the corporation  Leave your abandon'd lives  Roving like pirates and Jews  Come hither with your children and wives  And settle peaceably in our mews  We'll take you without any fuss  Here we have neither law nor code  You're only tied to copy us  And go by custom and the mode  You shall be fashionably dress'd  Protected treated and caress'd  A friseur with an instrument of steel  Shall shape your wings and your toupee  Make them sit perfectly genteel  Easy and free  As to the rest you may gather from my looks  Whether the air is good  And whether we have wholesome food  Or tolerable cooks  Peace wretch the chieftain of the ducks replied  Nor with thy venal breath offend the brave  Freedom is as much our pride  As 'tis thine to be a slave  We neither injure nor provoke  We neither fear great nor small  Because we scorn to yield to any yoke  We are hated by them all  From pole to pole pursued  From pole to pole  Our enemies have every soul  Been baffled and subdued  Lords of three elements we can maintain  Our freedom and possessions  With the same ease that we disdain  Thy offers and insidious professions  In our own virtue we confide  On others how can we rely  When fear or hope envy or pride  May turn a friend into a false ally  Those who depend on others  Whether on males or females they depend  Will find the swan has many brothers  And sisters without end  THE ADVICE OF AN OLD SPANIEL  A Certain dog of middling birth  Frolicksome and full of play  Even in the height of all his mirth  Delicate as well as gay  With far more feeling for his friend  Than they could either taste or comprehend  Being thrown into the world betimes  Betimes discover'd it was all a cheat  Yet not so dangerous for odious crimes  As odious for malice and deceit  Oft when he meant to have amus'd  His friends with a conceit or harmless jest  By many he was snarl'd at and abus'd  And slighted even by the best  Oft when halfstarv'd he found a bone  Or something hid  Instead of eating it alone  As others did  He ran to share his daily bread  Unsought  With those that were much better fed  Than taught  His daily bread they seiz'd  And drove him from their mess  More disappointed and displeas'd  With their ingratitude than his distress  It is a maxim amongst dogs  When they have the address and skill  To slip their collars and their clogs  And leave their friends that use them ill  To avoid anxiety and strife  Tray was resolv'd to try a country life  A country dog I think  Is exactly like a country squire  They both are only fit to sleep and stink  By their own fire  And when awake are only good  To yelp and halloo in a wood  Their joys  And conversation are the same  'Tis all a clamour and a noise  And all the noise and clamour about game  Three words compose their whole vocabulary  A fox a hare and a fine scenting day  Whether they are serious or merry  'Tis all they have to say  In short they never are so entertaining  As when they're fast asleep or feigning  To quit such friends as these  One would not grieve  Tray parted from them with great ease  Without so much as taking leave  Consults his grandsire by profession  A spaniel  For judgment and discretion  A perfect Daniel  Benign and mild  He heard his grandson's grievances and smil'd  Grandson said he I do conceive  If you had known the world and how things go  But half as much as you believe  Which is twice as much as I believe you know  You would not have complain'd  That dogs behave to one another  When they are unchain'd  Like every creature to his brother  Say dupe of a rash confidence and trust  If you lie open and unguarded  Is it not just  That vigilance should be rewarded  'Twas neither Nature's call  Nor my instruction  To trust your friends at all  Much less to trust them to your own destruction  A painful and severe attention  Is but a necessary fence  To every dog of sense  Against deceit and circumvention  A task from which you hop'd to be reliev'd  By trusting to your friends  You are deceiv'd  Acting as much as they for your own ends  All the world knows  That friendship's a meer sound  A sound that hardly can impose  Upon a puppy hound  Nature is not to blame  Flatter'd by cunning indolence invented  That foolish name  By which so many fools are circumvented  Happiness you'll seldom find  Unless you learn  To have no weighty interest or concern  With those of your own kind  Unless you learn if it is not too late  That they are neither worth your love nor hate  A PRESENT TO A YOUNG LADY WITH A PAIR OF STOCKINGS  BY FELLOW OF CAMBRIDGE  TO please the Fair what different ways  Each lover acts his part  One tenders snuff another praise  A toothpick or a heart  Alike they all to gain their end  Peculiar arts disclose  While I submissive only send  An humble pair of hose  Long may they guard from cold and harm  The snowy limbs that wear 'em  And kindly lend their influence warm  To every thing that's near 'em  But let it not be faulty deem'd  Nor move your indignation  If I a little partial seem'd  In gifts or commendation  Each fair perfection to display  Would far exceed my charter  My humble Muse must never stray  Above the knee or garter  And who did e'er a subject view  So worthy to be prais'd  Or from so fair foundation knew  So fine a structure rais'd  Thou learned leach sage Kember say  In spite of drugs and plaisters  You who can talk the livelong day  Of buildings and pilasters  You who for hours have rov'd about  Thro' halls and colonades  And scarce would deign to tread on aught  But arches and arcades  Did you in all your mazy rounds  Two nobler pillars view  What yielding marble ere was found  So exquisitely true  The swelling dome with stately show  May many fancies please  I view content what lies below  The cornice of the frieze  The lovely twins so white so round  That bear the noble pile  Must soon proceed from Venus' mound  Or from Cythera's isle  Propitious Fates preserve them safe  And keep them close together  And grant they may the malice brave  Of man as well as weather  From luckless love or rancour base  May never harm attend 'em  And grant whatever be the case  That I may still defend 'em  By gentle generous love 'tis true  They never can miscarry  No ill can come no loss ensue  From honest harmless Harry  But should a knight of greater heat  Precipitate invade  Believe me Bell they then may need  Some seasonable aid  O may I ready be at hand  From every harm to screen 'em  Then Samsonlike I'll take my stand  And live or die between 'em  THE COPPER FARTHING  BY MRS PENNINGTON  See her character in Poet Cal vol p  HAppy the boy who dwells remote from school  Whose pocket or whose rattling box contains  A copper farthing he nor grieving hears  Hot cheesecakes cried nor savoury muttonpies  But with his playmates in the dusk of eve  To wellknown blacksmith's shop or churchyard hies  Where mindful of the sport that joys his heart  Marbles or chuck he instantly begins  With undissembled pleasure in his face  To draw the circle or to pitch the dump  While I confin'd within the hated walls  Of school resounding with a clamorous din  By still more hated books environ'd I  With tedious lessons and long task to get  My dismal thoughts employ or wield my pen  To mark dire characters on paper white  Not blunter pen or stranger character  Uses the sage a chiromancer hight  Sprung from Egyptian king and swarthy race  Amenophis or Ptolemy when he  In search of stolen calf or money lost  For wondering ploughman does his art employ  Or for the wish'd return of sweetheart dear  Or apron fine purloin'd from hawthorn hedge  For countrymaid consults directing stars  Gemini Taurus or chill Capricorn  Thus while my lingering hours I joyless spend  With magisterial look and solemn step  Appears my schoolmaster tremendous wight  Dreaded by truant boys how can I 'scape  Th' expected punishment for task ungot  Aghast I stand nor fly to covert bench  Or corner dark to hide my hapless head  So great my terror that it quite bereaves  My limbs the power to fly slow he ascends  Th' appointed seat and on his righthand lies  The bushy rod compos'd of numerous twigs  Torn from the birchen tree or bending willow  Which to the flesh of idle boys portends  For the neglected task a poignant smart  And with him comes another mighty elf  Yclep'd an usher ah terrific name  To lesser wights who if they haply place  In station wrong pronoun or participle  Strait by the magic of his voice are rais'd  In attitude above their lov'd compeers  Where they reluctant various torments bear  'Till by their dolorous plaints that pierce the skies  They draw kind Pity

or worm  To which his maw insatiate forebodes  Certain destruction while behind or bush  Or pale encompassing the farmer's yard  Skulks Reynard fraught with many a crafty wile  T' ensnare the feather'd race who if they stray  Beyond the precincts of their mother's ken  He strait purloins them from her careful wing  With his sharp teeth torments their tender frame  And with the crimson gore distains their sides  Relentless nor can all the piercing cries  Of duckling chick or turkey yet unfledg'd  His heart obdurate move instant he tears  Each trembling limb devours the quivering flesh  Nor leaves a remnant of the bloody feast  Save a few fluttering feathers scatter'd round  That with their varied plumage whilom deck'd  The slaughter'd prey to tell the hapless tale  Thus joyless do I spend those hours the sun  Illuminates and when the silver moon  Her gentle ray dispenses and invites  The swains and maids to mix in jovial dance  Around the towering maypoles of the green  Where each gay ploughman does his partner chuse  As love or sate directs or o'er the lawn  The needle thread or toss the bounding ball  All cheerless I nor dance nor pleasing sport  Nor social mirth nor bowl of nappy ale  Partake but on her drooping raven wing  Sad melancholy hovers o'er my head  Pale envy rankles deep within my breast  And baneful venom sheds Grim horror too  Attends my thoughts and fills my gloomy mind  With tales of gliding sprites in milkwhite shrouds  Array'd and rattling chains and yelling ghosts  Irascible or Fancy mimic queen  To swift imagination's eye presents  A group of tiny elves in circling dance  Or luscious feast employ'd such elves as danc'd  When Oberon did fair Titania wed  While I in wishes impotent and vain  For liberty dear object of my hopes  The tedious moments spend or if perchance  Morpheus invok'd my heavy eyelids close  Dear liberty still haunts my sleeping thoughts  And in a shortliv'd dream those joys I taste  Which waking are denied and beat the hoop  With dexterous hand or run with feet as swift  As feather'd arrow flies from archer's bow  'Till from my slumber wak'd too soon I find  It was illusion all and mockery vain  Thus comfortless appall'd forlorn I pass  The tardy hours nor of those viands taste  Which are on other boys full oft bestow'd  In plenteous manner by the liberal hand  Of friend indulgent applepye or tart  Or trembling custard of delicious gout  Or frothy syllabub in copious bowl  Hard fate for me yet harder still betides  Me hapless youth my faithful top that oft  Has cheer'd my drooping spirits and reviv'd  My saddening thoughts when o'er the pavement smooth  It spins and sleeps and to its master's hand  Does ample justice now alas become  To all the rude inclemencies of weather  To time and destiny's relentless doom  A miserable victim quite decay'd  With many services and cleft throughout  All useless lies ah fight of saddest woe  To wretched me of every hope bereft  Of every gleam of comfort So the wretch  Who near or Aetna or Vesuvius dwells  Beholds the sulphurous flames the molten rocks  And feels the ground trembling beneath his feet  'Till with a horrid yawn it opens wide  Before his eyes all glaring with affright  Swallows his cultur'd vines his gardens house  With all his soul held dear his lovely wife  And prattling babes the hopes of years to come  All all are lost

HERTFORDSHIRE GROVE  BY JD  WHen evening gales allay the summer's heat  With pleasure I repair to this retreat  While birds around me sing and flocks around me bleat  They who retirement love this grove revere  On every side hills crown'd with woods appear  There venerable elms majestic beeches here  Hark how the feather'd choir their notes prolong  The mournful thrush bewails her captive young  And Philomela bears the burden of the song  The joyful shepherds whistling home repair  Horses and steers th' approach of night declare  For shepherds horses steers their daily tasks forbear  See where the hare just ventures out to graze  Cautious each hedge and thicket she surveys  And thro' the brakes and meadows timorously strays  Here Contemplation dwells with look serene  Here dwells Content that enemy to spleen  And oft by poets here the tuneful Nine are seen  Ye silent venerable glades all hail  Where sweets of blossom'd limes the smell regale  Where beauty on each side and dignity prevail  But hark the crickets chirp and warn my Muse  To quit these solemn shades fresh fall the dews  And glowworms o'er the lawn a glimmering light diffuse  THE MIDDLESEX GARDEN  TO MISS H

in your verse I seem "to ride  " Along th' enamell'd shore"  My rhymes by your example led  I once again renew  How can my Muse refrain to tread  The path explor'd by you  The beauties of the scenes in sight  She tempts me to rehearse  The beauties of these scenes invite  The culture of my verse  Where'er I turn my eyes around  Unnumber'd charms I view  Here trees with fruits delicious crown'd  There flowers of various hue  A fountain here invites repose  And waving over head  Tall firs in venerable rows  Afford a chequer'd shade  Behold the ivy and the vine  Together interwove  See fragrant honeysuckles twine  To form a rich alcove  The charms of Nature and of Art  United here we see  Order appears in every part  Mix'd with Variety  Neatness in white apparel here  And Delicacy dwell  The notes of birds regale my ear  The sweets of flowers my smell  The leaves and grass appear so green  The birds so blithely sing  That I can scarce discern between  The autumn and the spring  But soon will winter strip the woods  And strow with leaves the ground  And soon in icy chains the floods  By winter will be bound  And hark even now the winds advise  These shady banks to shun  Then cease my Muse quick let us rise  And bask in open sun  KENSINGTON GARDENS A PASTORAL  BY THE SAME  WHen now the spring had burst with genial power  Each rosy bud and open'd every flower  Thrown his green mantle on the fields and woods  And brush'd with balmy gales the curling floods  Scarce had the sun dispers'd with early ray  The shades of night and shed the dawn of day  Scarce had the slocks their dewdipt fleeces dried  Or silent anglers reach'd the glassy tide  When to those bowers which oft a monarch's care  With Britain's bliss and Europe's ballance share  To Kensington's fair bowers by Love inspir'd  With lonely step a pensive swain retir'd  While the blithe bullfinch tun'd his mellow lay  And the shrill blackbird whistled from the spray  O for that Muse which first in nervous strains  Display'd the splendor of these fairy plains  Where by the moon the dancing Fays were seen  And royal Kenna glimmer'd on the green  Eugenia then with equal charms should shine  And Tickell's Kensington should yield to mine  While in a brake conceal'd I now disclose  What there I heard and tell the shepherd's woes  " Ah what avails it me that Nature spreads  " Ambrosial fragrance o'er the verdant meads  " That from each bush melodious murmurs fly  " And soft aerial music fills the sky  " Nature in vain your fragrant flowers you spread  " In vain your songsters warble o'er my head  " Nor flowers my eye nor music charms my ear  " Not Eden's self can please 'till Eve appear  " Blest with Eugenia were I doom'd to seek  " The barren hills of Scotland or the Peak  " By Fortune's frown to dreary deserts sent  " The Fells of Westmorland or Wealds of Kent  " Even Fortune's frown her presence would beguile  " And make bleak hills and dreary deserts smile  " Invest each barren plain with bloomy pride  " And give those charms which Nature has denied  " But far from her I seek these lonely bowers  " And sooth with rural tasks the tedious hours  " Pluck the pale primrose from its velvet bed  " Or stray where cowslips hang the dewy head  " And pensive listen to the rustic lay  " Of jocund mowers chanting o'er their hay  " Now wrapt in thought and lost in devious shades  " With tuneful bards I court th' inspiring Maids  " With Thomson thro' each varying season rove  " Or mourn with Lyttelton in Hagley's grove  " Yet even their numbers my distress renew  " In Lucy my Eugenia's mind I view  " Or in Lavinia's blushing beauties trace  " The glowing charms that deck her polish'd face  " And must these glowing charms I sighing cry  " Still be reveal'd alone to fancy's eye  " Now pleas'd I listen to the feather'd throng  " While Love inspires and Nature tunes the song  " The lark sweet leader of the glossy train  " Tells his shrill tale of love nor tells in vain  " Hoarse thro' the wood the turtle strains her throat  " And cooes responsive to the ringdove's note  " While the blithe linnet in yon hawthornspray  " Delighted twitters her ecstatic lay  " To this soft theme each rising morn attends  " And evening hears it when her dew descends  " And can Eugenia whom all charms adorn  " As evening mild unclouded as the morn  " Sweet as the lark highpois'd in early air  " And as the linnet's downy plumage fair  " Can she her lover still regardless view  " Nor crown a passion like the turtle's true  " Oft to these plains enamour'd I retire  " Where thy proud turrets HollandHouse aspire  " Where Addison with courtly Warwick stray'd  " Or with his Tickell moraliz'd the shade  " Here on the prospect gazing with delight  " Hills woods and vallies strain my wondering sight  " Here tipt with gold the glittering villas rise  " There lost in smoke they mingle with the skies  " But short the pleasure which these plains attends  " Vain the delight which even this prospect lends  " Birth riches grandeur with contempt I view  " And wisdom goodness truth alone pursue  " I boast a love whose flame these objects guide  " Nor envy Addison his titled bride  " And undelighted all this landscape see  " While every thought Eugenia turns on thee  " And no kind vista points the fair retreat  " Where all these virtues now have fix'd their seat  " But see the lightning's momentary gleam  " Darts thro' the trees and glimmers on the stream  " And distant thunders with an ample growl  " From themes of love and sorrow rouze my soul  " Then cease fond swain for hark even now above  " Heard is your sorrow and approv'd your love  " The sympathising clouds condole your pain  " With you they murmur and with you complain  " The soothing breezes to your sighs reply  " And pitying drops soft trickle from the sky  " Then fly fond shepherd from this gloomy grove  " And seek the covert of yon close alcove  " There from all storms a shelter you may find  " But Love that raging tempest of the mind"  FAREWELL TO HOPE AN ODE  BY THE SAME  HOpe sweetest child of Fancy born  Tho' transient as the dew of morn  Thou who canst charm with sound and light  The deafen'd ear and darken'd sight  And in dry deserts glad the swains  With bubbling springs and cultur'd plains  No more invent thy airy schemes  Nor mock me with fantastic dreams  No more thy flattering stories tell  Deceitful prattler Hope farewell  Adieu the pleasing prospect plann'd  By Fancy's fair delusive hand  No more that momentary ray  Which gilds by fits a showery day  Shall show me in a distant grove  Health friendship peace content and love  While many a nymph and many a youth  By Hymen join'd and crown'd by Truth  On verdant hillocks danc'd and play'd  Or warbled in the hawthorn shade  No more with sweet endearing talk  Shalt thou beguile my vernal walk  No more as thro' the wintry vale  We journey on with many a tale  Of fancied pleasure cheer the day  And strow with flowers the rugged way  Still pointing to that rural cell  Where Innocence and Stella dwell  Charm with the bubbling of a rill  That gushes from the neighbouring hill  O let me now in silence rove  Thro' yon sequester'd cypress grove  Where crown'd with leaves of baleful yew  And circled by a Stygian crew  When from the ivymantled tower  The cock proclaims the midnight hour  Pale Melancholy takes her round  And o'er the mouldering hallow'd ground  Where lovers lie desponding stands  And dumb with pity wrings her hands  While thus with gloomy thought opprest  Heartpiercing sorrow heav'd my breast  A heavenly form swift gliding by  With healing comfort in her eye  A look of winning softness cast  And thus addrest me as she past  " Mortal be wise and even in death  " Let Hope receive thy parting breath  " Securely trust my guardian care  " And led by Reason shun Despair"  ON A LADY'S SENDING THE AUTHOR A RIBBON FOR HIS WATCH  BY THE SAME  NO fabled knight in days of yore  A trophy with more pleasure wore  Or flowery chaplet in a grove  By some distinguish'd damsel wove  To grace the warrior's shield decreed  Or swell the trappings of his steed  Nor Fielding's  Tom Jones then just published  Hero at the sight  Of Sophy's name felt more delight  Or more rejoic'd the muff survey'd  Which on her arm the Fair display'd  Than I this ribbon form'd to deck  With jetty pride Narcissa's neck  Instruction too this gift attends  For even the least a moral lends  The smallest insect of a day  That only flutters to decay  May bring important truths to view  And teach us that we're mortal too  Whene'er I turn my curious eye  To see how swift the minutes fly  Strait will your lov'd idea rise  And bid me those swift minutes prize  Thus warn'd your conduct I'll pursue  And own my Guide and Genius you  Who ne'er neglect the present hour  But snatch the moments in your power  And as the Sister Arts inspire  The pencil dip or string the lyre  Or pleas'd the vacant mind unbend  In converse with a learned friend  Conscious that time flies fast away  Nor can your worth prolong its stay  Thus if I learn my Fair from you  Whene'er this jetty string I view  Wisely the minutes to enjoy  And in improving arts employ  Much by this ribbon I shall gain  And you'll not think it given in vain  ON SEEING CAPT CORNWALL'S MONUMENT IN WESTMINSTERABBEY  BY THE SAME  THO' Britain's Genius hung his drooping head  And mourn'd her antient naval glory fled  On that fam'd day when France combin'd with Spain  Strove for the wide dominion of the main  Yet Cornwall all with grateful voice agree  To pay the tribute of applause to thee  When his bold chief in thickest fight engag'd  Unequal war with Spain's proud leader wag'd  With indignation mov'd he timely came  To rescue from reproach his country's fame  Success too dearly did his valour crown  He sav'd his leader's lifeand lost his own  Her warlike son Britannia thus repays  That latest times may learn the

Chiefs that deck the letter'd age  Of Greece and Rome adorn'd the British stage  Tonight majestic in distress is seen  A brave a generous tho' a Gothic queen  Who strove to polish with each milder grace  And soften into men that savage race  Rever'd at home abroad with conquest crown'd  A foe more dangerous in her court she found  For Love that tyrant whose despotic sway  Alike the cottage and the throne obey  With the bright lustre of a Hero's charms  By stealth her soft unguarded bosom warms  Each answering heart in silken fetters binds  And forms that tender sympathy of minds  Which lovers only feel that source of joy  Which nought but jealousy can e'er destroy  So far'd the Heroine whose untutor'd bands  Struck terror into distant polish'd lands  Unskill'd in arts refining to enslave  Tho' plain their habits yet their hearts were brave  They learn'd one science onlyto subdue  Nor softer music than the trumpet knew  And these while Rome to luxury a prey  In sloth and folly languish'd life away  Swift as a mountaintorrent rushing forth  From the bleak caverns of their native North  Chas'd learning's votaries from their classic plains  And bound the rulers of the world in chains  Britons by such examples warn'd beware  Nor share their vices left their fate ye share  'Twas luxury foreran the Grecian doom  'Twas luxury that min'd the walls of Rome  The servile state of those fam'd empires view  But think O think they once resembled you  EPIGRAMS  BY THE SAME  IN soft Narcissa's form united shine  Such female ease and majesty divine  That each beholder must with awe declare  Apelles' Venus was not half so fair  But when the stores of judgment wit and sense  Her lips with graceful modesty dispense  Each hearer owns with pleasure and surprize  That Homer's Pallas was not half so wise  These different charms such different passions move  Who sees must reverence but who hears must love  ON A LADY'S HURTING HER HAND WITH THE AUTHOR'S SWORD  A Fate like mine as poets sing  The son of Tydeus found  Who durst on Beauty's Queen inflict  A sacrilegious wound  But deeper is the wound I feel  And keener is the smart  Since Venus' self must own the hand  Less

SAT VII BOOK II IMITATED  BY THE LATE MR CHRIST PITT  A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A POET AND HIS SERVANT  To enter into the beauties of this satire it must be remembered that slaves among the Romans during the feasts of Saturn wore their masters habits and were allowed to say what they pleased  SERVANT  SIRI've long waited in my turn to have  A word with youbut I'm your humble slave  P  What knave is that my rascal  S  Sir 'tis I  No knave nor rascal but your trusty Guy  P  Well as your wages still are due I'll bear  Your rude impertinence this time of year  S  Some folks are drunk one day and some forever  And some like Wharton but twelve years together  Old Evremond renown'd for wit and dirt  Would change his living oftener than his shirt  Roar with the rakes of state a month and come  To starve another in his hole at home  So rov'd wild Buckingham the public jest  Now some Innholder's now a monarch's guest  His life and politics of every shape  This hour a Roman and the next an ape  The gout in every limb from every vice  Poor Clodio hir'd a boy to throw the dice  Some wench for ever and their sins on those  By custom sit as easy as their cloaths  Some fly like pendulums from good to evil  And in that point are madder than the devil  For they  P  To what will these vile maxims tend  And where sweet sir will your reflections end  S  In you  P  In me you knave make out your charge  S  You praise lowliving but you live at large  Perhaps you scarce believe the rules you teach  Or find it hard to practise what you preach  Scarce have you paid one idle journey down  But without business you're again in town  If none invite you sir abroad to roam  ThenLord what pleasure 'tis to read at home  And sip your two halfpints with great delight  Of beer at noon and muddled port at night  From  The seat of John Pitt esq in Dersetshire  Encombe John comes thundering at the door  With "Sir my master begs you to come o'er  " To pass these tedious hours these winter nights  " Not that he dreads invasions rogues or sprites"  Strait for your two best wigs aloud you call  This stiff in buckle that not curl'd at all  " And where you rascal are the spurs" you cry  " And O what blockhead laid the buskins by"  On your old batter'd mare you'll needs be gone  No matter whether on four legs or none  Splash plunge and stumble as you scour the heath  All swear at Morden 'tis on life or death  Wildly thro' Wareham streets you scamper on  Raise all the dogs and voters in the town  Then fly for six long dirty miles as bad  That Corfe and Kingston gentry think you mad  And all this furious riding is to prove  Your high respect it seems and eager love  And yet that mighty honour to obtain  Banks Shaftesbury Dodington may send in vain  Before you go we curse the noise you make  And bless the moment that you turn your back  As for myself I own it to your face  I love good eating and I take my glass  But sure 'tis strange dear sir that this should be  In you amusement but a fault in me  All this is bare refining on a name  To make a difference where the fault's the same  My father sold me to your service here  For this sine livery and four pounds a year  A livery you should wear as well as I  And this I'll provebut lay your cudgel by  You serve your passionsThus without a jest  Both are but fellowservants at the best  Yourself good sir are play'd by your desires  A mere tall puppet dancing on the wires  P  Who at this rate of talking can be free  S  The brave wise honest man and only he  All else are slaves alike the world around  Kings on the throne and beggars on the ground  He sir is proof to grandeur pride or pelf  And greater still is master of himself  Not toandfro by fears and factions hurl'd  But loose to all the interests of the world  And while that world turns round entire and whole  He keeps the sacred tenor of his soul  In every turn of fortune still the same  As gold unchang'd or brighter from the flame  Collected in himself with godlike pride  He sees the darts of envy glance aside  And fix'd like Atlas while the tempests blow  Smiles at the idle storms that roar below  One such you know a layman to your shame  And yet the honour of your blood and name  If you can such a character maintain  You too are free and I'm your slave again  But when in Hemskirk's pictures you delight  More than myself to see two drunkards fight  " Fool rogue sot blockhead" or such names are mine  " Your's are "a Connoisseur" or "Deep Divine"  I'm chid for loving a luxurious bit  The sacred prize of learning worth and wit  And yet some sell their lands these bits to buy  Then pray who suffers most from luxury  I'm chid 'tis true but then I pawn no plate  I seal no bonds I mortgage no estate  Besides high living sir must wear you out  With surfeits qualms a fever or the gout  By some new pleasures are you still engross'd  And when you save an hour you think it lost  To sports plays races from your books you run  And like all company except your own  You hunt drink sleep or idler still you rhyme  Whybut to banish thought and murder time  And yet that thought which you discharge in vain  Like a foulloaded piece recoils again  P  Tom fetch a cane a whip a club a stone  S  For what  P  A sword a pistol or a gun  I'll shoot the dog  S  Lord who would be a wit  He's in a mad or in a rhyming fit  P  Fly fly you rascal for your spade and fork  For once I'll set your lazy bones to work  Fly or I'll send you back without a groat  To the bleak mountains where you first were caught  HORACE EPIST IV BOOK I IMITATED  BY THE SAME HAND  TO JOHN PITT ESQ  DEAR SIR  To all my trifles you attend  But drop the critic to indulge the friend  And with most Christian patience lose your time  To hear me preach or pester you with rhyme  Here with my books or friends I spend the day  But how at Kingston pass your hours away  Say shall we see some plan with ravish'd eyes  Some future pile in miniature arise  A model to excel in every part  Judicious Jones or great Palladio's art  Or some new bill that when the house is met  Shall claim their thanks and pay the nation's debt  Or do you study in the silent wood  The sacred duties of the wise and good  Nature who form'd you nobly crown'd the whole  With a strong body and as firm a soul  The praise is your's to finish every part  With all th' embellishments of taste and art  Some see in canker'd heaps their riches roll'd  Your bounty gives new splendor to your gold  Could your dead father hope a greater bliss  Or your surviving parent more than this  Than such a sona lover of the laws  And ever true to honour's glorious cause  Who scorns all parties tho' by parties sought  Who greatly thinks and truly speaks his thought  With all the chaste severity of sense  Truth judgment wit and manly eloquence  So in his youth great Cato was rever'd  By Pompey courted and by Caesar fear'd  Both he disdain'd alike with godlike pride  For Rome and Liberty he liv'dand died  In each perfection as you rise so fast  Well may you think each day may be your last  Uncommon worth is still with fate at strife  Still inconsistent with a length of life  The future time is never in your power  Then 'tis clear gain to seize the present hour  Break from your serious thoughts and laugh away  In Pimpern walls one idle easy day  You'll find your rhyming kinsman well in case  For ever fix'd to this delicious place  Tho' not like Lynch with corpulence o'ergrown  For he has twenty cures and I but one  HOR EPIST XVIII BOOK I IMITATED  BY THE SAME HAND  TO MR SPENCE WHEN TUTOR TO THE EARL OF MIDDLESEX  SPence with a friend you pass the hours away  In pointed jokes yet innocently gay  You ever differ'd from a flatterer more  Than a chaste lady from a flaunting whore  'Tis true you raillied every fault you found  But gently tickled while you heal'd the wound  Unlike the paltry poets of the town  Rogues who expose themselves for half a crown  And still obtrude on every soul they meet  Rudeness for sense and ribaldry for wit  Who tho' halfstarv'd in spite of time and place  Repeat their rhymes tho' dinner stays for grace  And as their poverty their dresses fit  They think of course a sloven is a wit  But sense a truth these coxcombs ne'er suspect  Lies just 'twixt affectation and neglect  One step still lower if you can descend  To the mean wretch the great man's humble friend  That moving shade that pendant at his ear  That twolegg'd dog still pawing on the Peer  Studying his looks and watching at the board  He gapes to catch the droppings of my lord  And tickled to the soul at every joke  Like a press'd watch repeats what t'other spoke  Echo to nonsense such a scene to hear  'Tis just like Punch and his interpreter  On trifles some are earnestly absurd  You'll think the world depends on every word  " What is not every mortal free to speak  " I'll give my reasons tho' I break my neck"  And what's the question if it shines or rains  Whether 'tis twelve or fifteen miles to Stains  The wretch reduc'd to rags by every vice  Pride projects races mistresses and dice  The rich rogue shuns tho' full as bad as he  And knows a quarrel is good husbandry  " 'Tis strange cries Peter you are out of pelf  " I'm sure I thought you wiser than myself"  Yet gives him nothingbut advice too late  " Retrench or rather mortgage your estate  " I can advance the sum'tis best for both  " But henceforth cut your coat to match your cloth"  A minister in mere revenge and sport  Will give his foe a paltry place at court  The dupe for every royal birthday buys  New horses coaches cloaths and liveries  Plies at the levee and distinguish'd there  Lives on the royal whisper for a year  His mistress shines in Brussels and brocade  And now the wretch ridiculously mad  Draws on his banker mortgages and fails  Then to the country runs away from jails  There ruin'd by the court he sells a vote  To the next burgess as of old he bought  Rubs down the steeds which once his chariot bore  Or sweeps the borough which he serv'd before  But by this roving meteor led I tend  Beyond my theme forgetful of my friend  Then take advice and preach not out of time  When good lord Middlesex is bent on rhyme  Their humour check'd or inclination crost  Sometimes the friendship of the great is lost  With innocent amusements still comply  Hunt when he hunts and lay the Fathers by  For your reward you gain his love and dine  On the best venison and the best French wine  Never in wine or wrath betray your trust  Be silent still and obstinately just  Explore no secrets draw no characters  For echo will repeat and walls have ears  Nor let a busy fool a secret know  A secret gripes him 'till he lets it go  Words are like bullets and we wish in vain  When once discharg'd to call them back again  Defend dear Spence the honest and the civil  But to cry up a rascalthat's the devil  Who guards a good man's character 'tis known  At the same time protects and guards his own  For as with houses so it fares with names  A shed may set a palace all on flames  The fire neglected on the cottage preys  And mounts at last into a general blaze  'Tis a fine thing some think a lord to know  I wish his tradesmen could but think so too  He gives his wordthen all your hopes are gone  He gives his honourthen you're quite undone  Most folks so partial to themselves are grown  They hate a temper differing from their own  The grave abhor the gay the gay the sad  And formalists pronounce the witty mad  The sot who drinks six bottles in a place  Swears at the flinchers who refuse their glass  Would you not pass for an illnatur'd man  Comply with every humour that you can  Pope will instruct you how to pass away  Your time like him and never lose a day  From hopes or fears your quiet to defend  To all mankind as to yourself a friend  And sacred from the world retir'd unknown  To lead a life with morals like his own  When to delicious Pimpern I retire  What greater bliss my Spence can I desire  Contented there my easy hours I spend  With maps globes books my bottle and a friend  There I can live upon my income still  Even tho' the house should pass the Quaker's bill  Yet to my share should some good prebend fall  I think myself of size to fill a stall  For life or health let heaven my lot assign  A firm and even soul shall still be mine  HOR EPIST XIX BOOK I IMITATED  BY THE SAME HAND  TO MR LOWTH  'TIS said dear sir no poets please the town  Who drink mere water tho' from Helicon  For in cold blood they seldom boldly think  Their rhymes are more insipid than their drink  Not great Apollo could the train inspire  'Till generous Bacchus help'd to fan the fire  Warm'd by two gods at once they drink and write  Rhyme all the day and tipple all the night  Homer says Horace nods in many a place  But hints he nodded oftner o'er the glass  Inspir'd with wine old Ennius sung and thought  With the same spirit that his heroes fought  And we from Johnson's tavernlaws divine  That Bard was no great enemy to wine  'Twas from the bottle King deriv'd his wit  Drank 'till he could not talk and then he writ  Let no coif'd serjeant touch the sacred juice  But leave it to the bards for better use  Let the grave judges too the glass forbear  Who never sing and dance but once a year  This truth once known the poets take the hint  Get drunk or mad and then get into print  To raise their flames indulge the mellow fit  And lose their senses in the search of wit  And when with claret fir'd they take the pen  Swear they can write because they drink like Ben  Such mimic Swift or Prior to their cost  For in the rash attempt the fools are lost  When once a genius breaks thro' common rules  He leads a herd of imitating fools  If Pope the prince of poets fick abed  O'er steaming coffee bends his aching head  The fools in public o'er the fragrant draught  Incline those heads that never ach'd or thought  This must provoke his mirth or his disdain  Cure his complaintor make him sick again  I too like them the poet's path pursue  And keep great Flaccus ever in my view  But in a distant viewyet what I write  In these loose sheets must never see the light  Epistles odes and twenty trifles more  Things that are born and die in half an hour  " What you must dedicate" says sneering Spence  " This year some new performance to the prince  " Tho' money is your scorn no doubt in time  " You hope to gain some vacant stall by rhyme  " Like other poets were the truth but known  " You too admire whatever is your own"  These wise remarks my modesty confound  While the laugh rises and the mirth goes round  Vex'd at the jest yet glad to shun a fray  I whisk into a coach and drive away  AN EPISTLE TO MR SPENCE IN IMITATION OF HORACE EPIST X BOOK I  BY THE SAME  HEalth from the bard who loves the rural sport  To the more noble bard that haunts the court  In every other point of life we chime  Like two soft lines when coupled into rhyme  I praise a spacious villa to the sky  You a close garret full five stories high  I revel here in Nature's varied sweets  You in the nobler scents of London streets  I left the court and here at ease reclin'd  Am happier than the king who stay'd behind  Twelve stifling dishes I could scarce live o'er  At home I dine with luxury on four  Where would a man of judgment chuse a seat  But in a wholesome rural soft retreat  Where hills adorn the mansion they defend  Where could he better answer Nature's end  Here from the sea the melting breezes rise  Unbind the snow and warm the wintry skies  Here gentle gales the dogstar's heat allay  And softly breathing cool the sultry day  How free from cares from dangers and affright  In pleasing dreams I pass the silent night  Does not the variegated marble yield  To the gay colours of the flowery field  Can the NewRiver's artificial streams  Or the thick waters of the troubled Thames  In many a winding rusty pipe convey'd  Or dash'd and broken down a deep cascade  With our clear silver streams in sweetness vie  That in eternal rills run bubbling by  In dimples o'er the polish'd pebbles pass  Glide o'er the sands or glitter thro' the grass  And yet in town the country prospects please  Where stately colonnades are flank'd with trees  On a whole country looks the master down  With pride where scarce five acres are his own  Yet Nature tho' repell'd maintains her part  And in her turn she triumphs over art  The handmaid now may prejudice our taste  But the fair mistress will prevail at last  That man must smart at length whose puzzled sight  Mistakes in life false colours for the right  As the poor dupe is sure his loss to rue  Who takes a Pinchbeck guinea for a true  The wretch whose frantic pride kind fortune crowns  Grows twice as abject when the goddess frowns  As he who rises when his head turns round  Must tumble twice as heavy to the ground  Then love not grandeur 'tis a splendid curse  The more the love the harder the divorce  We live far happier by these gurgling springs  Than statesmen courtiers counsellors or kings  The stag expell'd the courser from the plain  What can he dohe begs the aid of man  He takes the bit and proudly bears away  His new allyhe fights and wins the day  But ruin'd by success he strives in vain  To quit his master and the curb again  So from the fear of want most wretches fly  But lose their noblest wealth their liberty  To their imperious passions they submit  Who mount ride spur but never draw the bit  'Tis with your fortune Spence as with your shoe  A large may wrench a small one wring your toe  Then bear your fortune in the golden mean  Not every man is born to be a Dean  I'll bear your jeers if ever I am known  To seek two cures when scarce I merit one  Riches 'tis true some service may afford  But oftner play the tyrant o'er their lord  Money I scorn but keep a little still  To pay my doctor's or my lawyer's bill  From Encombe's soft romantic scenes I write  Deep sunk in ease in pleasure and delight  Yet tho' her generous lord himself is here  'Twould be one pleasure more could you appear  THE INVITATION AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND AT COURT  BY THE SAME  IF you can leave for books the crouded court  And generous Bourdeaux for a glass of Port  To these sweet solitudes without delay  Break from the world's impertinence away  Soon as the sun the face of nature gilds  For health and pleasure will we range the fields  O'er her gay scenes and opening beauties run  While all the vast creation is our own  But when his golden globe with faded light  Yields to the solemn empire of the night  And in her sober majesty the moon  With milder glories mounts her silver throne  Amidst ten thousand orbs with splendor crown'd  That pour their tributary beams around  Thro' the long levell'd tube our strengthen'd sight  Shall mark distinct the spangles of the night  From world to world shall dart the boundless eye  And stretch from star to star from sky to sky  The buzzing insect families appear  When suns unbind the rigour of the year  Quick glance the myriads round the evening bower  Hosts of a day or nations of an hour  Astonish'd we shall see th' unfolding race  Stretch'd out in bulk within the polish'd glass  Thro' whose small convex a new world we spy  Ne'er seen before but by a seraph's eye  So long in darkness shut from human kind  Lay half God's wonders to a point confin'd  But in one peopled drop we now survey  In pride of power some little monster play  O'er tribes invisible he reigns alone  And struts a tyrant of a world his own  Now will we study Homer's awful page  Now warm our souls with Pindar's noble rage  To English lays shall Flaccus' lyre be strung  And lofty Virgil speak the British tongue  Immortal Virgil at thy sacred name  I tremble now and now I pant for fame  With eager hopes this moment I aspire  To catch or emulate thy glorious fire  The next pursue the rash attempt no more  But drop the quill bow wonder and adore  By thy strong genius overcome and aw'd  That fire from heaven that spirit of a God  Pleas'd and transported with thy name I tend  Beyond my theme forgetful of my friend  And from my first design by rapture led  Neglect the living poet for the dead  ODE TO JOHN PITT ESQ ADVISING HIM TO BUILD A BANQUETINGHOUSE ON A HILL THAT OVERLOOKS THE SEA  FRom this tall promontory's brow  You look majestic down  And see extended wide below  Th' horizon all your own  With growing piles the vales are crown'd  Here hills peep over hills  There the vast sky and sea profound  Th' increasing prospect fills  O bid my friend a structure rise  And this huge round command  Then shall this little point comprise  The ocean and the land  Then you like Aeolus on high  From your aerial tower  Shall see secure the billows fly  And hear the whirlwinds roar  You with a smile their rage despise  'Till some sad wreck appears  And calls from your relenting eyes  The sympathizing tears  Thus may you view with proud delight  While winds the deep deform  'Till human woes your grief excite  All nature in a storm  Majestic awful scene when hurl'd  On surges surges rife  And all the heaving watry world  Tumultuous mounts the skies  The seas and thunder roar by turns  By turns the peals expire  The billows flash and ether burns  With momentary fire  But lo the furious tempests cease  The mighty rage subsides  Old ocean hush'd in solemn peace  Has still'd the murmuring tides  Spread wide abroad the glassy plain  In various colours gay  Reflects the glorious sun again  And doubly gilds the day  Th' horizon glows from side to side  And flames with glancing rays  The floating trembling silver tide  Is one continual blaze  Your eyes the prospect now command  All uncontroul'd and free  Fly like a thought from land to land  And dart from sea to sea  Thus while above the clouds we sit  And innocently gay  Pass in amusements wine or wit  The sultry hours away  Sometimes with pity or disdain  In thought a glance we throw  Down on the poor the proud the vain  In yonder world below  We see from this exalted seat  How shrunk reduc'd confin'd  The little person of the great  As little as his mind  See thereamidst the crowds our view  Some scatter'd virtues strike  But those so throng'd and these so few  The world looks all alike  Yet thro' this cloud of human kind  The Talbots we survey  The Pitts the Yorks the Seckers find  Who shine in open day  TO THE SAME ON THE SAME SUBJECT  O'ER curious models as you rove  The vales with piles to crown  And great Palladio's plans improve  With nobler of your own  O bid a structure o'er the floods  From this high mountain rise  Where we may sit enthron'd like gods  And revel in the skies  Th' ascending breeze at each repast  Shall breathe an air divine  Give a new brightness to the taste  New spirit to the wine  Or these low pleasures we may quit  For banquets more refin'd  The works of each immortal wit  The luxury of the mind  Plato or Boyle's or Newton's page  Our towering thoughts shall raise  Or Homer's fire or Pindar's rage  Or Virgil's lofty lays  Or with amusive thoughts the Sea  Shall entertain the mind  While we the rolling scene survey  An emblem of mankind  Where like sworn foes successive all  The furious surges run  To urge their predecessor's fall  Tho' follow'd by their own  Where like our moderns so profound  Engag'd in dark dispute  The skuttles cast their ink around  To puzzle the dispute  Where sharks like shrewd directors thrive  Like lawyers rob at will  Where flyingfish like trimmers live  Like soldiers swordfish kill  Where on the less the greater feed  The tyrants of an hour  'Till the huge royal whales succeed  And all at once devour  Thus in the moral world we now  Too truly understand  Each monster of the sea below  Is match'd by one at land  ON MRS WALKER'S POEMS PARTICULARLY THAT ON THE AUTHOR  BLush Wilmot blush a female muse  Without one

WORKED BY THE YOUNG LADIES AT KINGSTON  WHen Pallas saw the piece her pupils wrought  She stood long wondering at the lovely draught  " And Flora now she cried no more display  Thy flowers the trifling beauties of a day  For see how these with life immortal bloom  And spread and flourish for an age to come  In what unguarded hour did I impart  To these fair virgins all my darling art  In all my wit I saw these rivals shine  But this one art I thought was always mine  Yet lo I yield their mistress now no more  But proud to learn from these I taught before  For look what vegetable sense is here  How warm with life these blushing leaves appear  What temper'd splendors o'er the piece are laid  Shade steals on light and light dies into shade  Thro' heaven's gay bow less various beauties run  And far less bright tho' painted by the sun  See in each blooming flower what spirit glows  What vivid colours flush the opening rose  In some few hours thy lilly disappears  But this shall flourish thro' a length of years  See unfelt winters pass successive by  And scorn a mean dependence on the sky  And oh may Britain by my counsels sway'd  But live and flourish 'till these flowers shall fade  Then go fond Flora go the palm resign  To works more fair and durable than thine  For I even I in justice yield the crown  To works so far superior to my own"  ON THE SAME SUBJECT  ON this

Chapter and at Child's to read  For pence and bury for a groat a head  Some easy subject chuse within your power  Or you will ne'er hold out for half an hour  Still to your hearers all your sermons

Chancery at the Rolls  Or rail at hoods and organs at St Pauls  Or be like David Jones so indiscreet  To rave at usurers in Lombardstreet  Begin with care nor like that curate vile  Set out in this high prancing stumbling style  " Whoever with a piercing eye can see  " Thro' the past records of futurity"  All gape no meaningthe puft orator  Talks much and says just nothing for an hour  Truth and the text he labours to display  Till both are quite interpreted away  So frugal dames insipid water pour  Till green bohea or coffee are no more  His arguments in giddy circles run  Still round and round and end where they begun  So the poor turnspit as the wheel runs round  The more he gains the more he loses ground  No parts distinct or general scheme we find  But one wild shapeless monster of the mind  So when old bruin teems her children fail  Of limbs form figure features head or tail  Nay tho' she licks the ruins all her cares  Scarce mend the lumps and bring them but to bears  Ye country vicars when you preach in town  A turn at Paul's to pay your journey down  If you would shun the sneer of every prig  Lay by the little band and rusty wig  But yet be sure your proper language know  Nor talk as born within the sound of Bow  Speak not the phrase that Drurylane affords  Nor from Changealley steal a cant of words  Coachmen will criticise your style nay further  Porters will bring it in for wilful murther  The dregs of the canaille will look askew  To hear the language of the town from you  Nay my lord mayor with merriment possest  Will break his nap and laugh among the rest  And jog the aldermen to hear the jest  * * * * * *  AN EPITAPH INSCRIBED ON A STONE THAT COVERS HIS FATHER MOTHER AND BROTHER  YE sacred spirits while your friends distress'd  Weep o'er your

farm  My fancy when with antient authors charm  Or lull'd to sleep the cares of life elude  In sweet oblivion of solicitude  O for those beans which my own fields provide  Deem'd by Pythagoras to man allied  The savoury pulse serv'd up in platters nice  And herbs highrelish'd with the bacon slice  O tranquil nights in pleasing converse spent  Ambrosial suppers that might gods content  When with my chosen friends delicious treat  Before the houshold deities we eat  The slaves themselves regale on choicest meat  Free from mad laws we sit reclin'd at ease  And drink as much or little as we please  Some quaff large bumpers that expand the soul  And some grow mellow with a moderate bowl  We never talk of this man's house or vill  Or whether Lepos dances well or ill  But of those duties which ourselves we owe  And which 'tis quite a scandal not to know  As whether wealth or virtue can impart  The truest pleasure to the human heart  What should direct us in our choice of friends  Their own pure merit or our private ends  What we may deem if rightly understood  Man's sovereign bliss his chief his only good  Meantime my friend old Cervius never fails  To cheer our converse with his pithy tales  Praise but Arellius or his illgot store  His fable thus begins "In days of yore  A country mouse within his homely cave  A treat to one of note a courtier gave  A good plain mouse our host who lov'd to spare  Those heaps of forage he had glean'd with care  Yet on occasion would his soul unbend  And feast with hospitality his friend  He brought wild oats and vetches from his hoard  Dried grapes and scraps of bacon grac'd the board  In hopes no doubt by such a various treat  To tempt the dainty traveller to eat  Squat on fresh chaff the master of the feast  Left all the choicest viands for his guest  Nor one nice morsel for himself would spare  But gnaw'd coarse grain or nibbled at a tare  At length their slender dinner finish'd quite  Thus to the rustic spoke the mouse polite  ' How can my friend a wretched being drag  ' On the bleak summit of this airy crag  ' Say do you still prefer this barbarous den  ' To polish'd cities savages to men  ' Come come with me nor longer here abide  ' I'll be your friend your comrade and your guide  ' Since all must die that draw this vital breath  ' Nor great nor small can shun the shafts of death  ' 'Tis ours to sport in pleasures while we may  ' For ever mindful of life's little day'  These weighty reasons sway'd the country mouse  And light of heart he sallied from his house  Resolv'd to travel with this courtly spark  And gain the city when securely dark  Now midnight hover'd o'er this earthly ball  When our small gentry reach'd a stately hall  Where brightly glowing stain'd with Tyrian dye  On ivory couches richest carpets lie  And in large baskets rang'd along the floor  The rich collation of the night before  On purple bed the courtier plac'd his guest  And with choice cates prolong'd the grateful feast  He carv'd he serv'd as much as mouse could do  And was his waiter and his taster too  Joy seiz'd the rustic as at ease he lay  This happy change had made him wondrous gay  When lo the doors burst open in a trice  And at their banquet terrified the mice  They start they tremble in a deadly fright  And round the room precipitate their flight  The highroof'd room with hideous cries resounds  Of baying mastiffs and loudbellowing hounds  Then thus the rustic in the courtier's ear  ' Adieu kind sir I thank you for your cheer  ' Safe in my cell your state I envy not  ' Tares be my food and liberty my lot"  F  A PARODY ON THE CITY AND COUNTRY MOUSE  A Country vicar in his homely house  Pleas'd with his lot and happy in his spouse  With simple diet at his humble board  Once entertain'd the chaplain of a lord  He gave him all he could a little fish  With sauce of oysters in no silver dish  And for the craving stomach's sure relief  The glory of Old England rare Roastbeef  Horseradish and potatoes Ireland's pride  A pudding too the prudent dame supplied  Their cheering beverage was a pint of port  Tho' small the quantum of the better sort  But plenty of good beer both small and stout  With wine of elder to prevent the gout  The vicar hop'd by such a various treat  To tempt his scarfembellish'd friend to eat  With nicest bits provok'd his guest to dine  He carv'd the haddock and he serv'd the wine  Content his own sharp stomach to regale  With plain substantial roastmeat and mild ale  Our courtly chaplain as we may suppose  At such oldfashion'd commons curl'd his nose  He tried in vain to piddle and in brief  Pish'd at the pudding and declin'd the beef  At length their homely dinner finish'd quite  Thus to the vicar spoke the priest polite  ' How can my brother in this paltry town  ' Live undistinguish'd to the world unknown  ' And not exalt your towering genius higher  ' Than here to herd with country clownor squire  ' Stunn'd with the discord of hoarse cawing rooks  ' The roar of winds the dissonance of brooks  ' Which discontented thro' the valley stray  ' Plaintive and murmuring at their long delay  ' Come come with me nor longer here abide  ' You've friends in town and I will be your guide  ' Soon great preferment to your share will fall  ' A good fat living or perhapsa stall'  These weighty reasons sway'd the vicar's mind  To town he hied but left his wife behind  Next leveeday he waited on his Grace  With hundreds more who bow'd to get a place  Shov'd in the croud he stood amaz'd to see  Lords who to Baal bent the supple knee  And doctors sage he could not but admire  Who stoop'd profoundly lowto rise the higher  So much of ermine lace beaus bishops young and old  'Twas like a cloud of sable edg'd with gold  By turns his Grace the servile train addrest  Pleas'd with a smile or in a whisper blest  Sick of the scene the vicar sought the door  Determin'd never to see London more  But as his friend had pleas'd the hour to fix  First went to dinner to my Lord's at six  He knock'dwas usher'd to the room of state  My Lord abroad and dinner serv'd in plate  Which tho' it seem'd but common soup and hash  Was really callipee and callipash  The relicks of the gaudy day before  What Indians eat and Englishmen adore  With bright champaign the courtier crown'd the feast  Sooth'd his own pride and gratified his guest  All this conspir'd our Stoic to controul  And warpt the steady purpose of his soul  When lo the cry of fire creates amaze  " The next house Lady Riot's in a blaze"  Aghast the vicar stood in wild affright  Then briefly thus address'd the priest polite  " Adieu my friendyour state I envy not  " Beef liberty and safety be my lot"  F  HORACE EPIST V BOOK I IMITATED  TO JOHN HH ESQ  IF you dear sir will deign to pass a day

invent  The cursed art of navigation  When to the wind we spread our sails  Upon the pathless ocean strolling  Cramm'd in a tub stuck full of nails  Like Regulus we die with rolling  A plague upon the nauseous brine  What benefit receive we from it  Unless with rank disease we pine  And use it for a purge or vomit  While Eve in innocence did dwell  Her water in fresh rills descended  But soon as she to folly fell  The violet stream with brine was blended  The race of men in antient times  Were bent on rapine and on slaughter  When heaven incensed at their crimes  Decreed their deaths and sent salt water  And when those heavy judgments past  On Aegypt for her plagues renowned  Salt water was reserv'd the last  And Pharoah and his host were drowned  When we who now are turn'd to fish  And with the scurvy grown all scaly  And made for shark a curious dish  While overboard we're tumbled daily  May you who on the land abide  Our element to mourn us borrow  Let fall of tears a briny tide
