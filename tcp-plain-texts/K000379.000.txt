 HINTS TO A SCHOOLMASTER Address'd to the Rev  d  Dr TURNBULL  By STEPHEN DUCK  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  and R DODSLEY in  Pallmall  MDDCXLI Price Sixpence  HINTS TO A SCHOOLMASTER  I  _SHOULD You my Friend employ your Time  In teaching tuneful POPE to rhyme  And harmonize his Style  Or should our Poet cease to write  And teach brave VERNON how to fight  The wond'ring World would smile  II  Not less absurd may I be thought  Who bred from  Colleges  remote  In honest simple Truth  Ne'er study'd Science at the  Schools    And yet presume to give  You  Rules  For educating Youth  III  Yet if the Maxims I advance  May be of Use or right by chance  They cannot give Offence  Forgive me then for  Reason  's sake  For  Reason  dictates what I speak  And says 'tis  Common Sense  IV  A Man of  mod'rate  Skill may teach  His Pupils all the  Parts of Speech    Perhaps old HOMER's Songs  But there are other things my Friend  Important things that far transcend  This wond'rous Gift of Tongues  V  O skill'd in all the various Parts  Of  Learning  and the  lib'ral Arts    That polish Human Kind  Early instruct your tender Youth  In Heav'n's unerring  Law of Truth    Engrave it on their Mind  VI  Ere Vice the spotless Paper foul  Imprint the Volume of the Soul  With VIRTUE's noble Mark  The Mark extending by degrees  Shall grow like Letters carv'd on Trees  That widen with the Bark  VII  As VIRTUE shall her Charms display  Charms which increasing ev'ry Day  Shall make her more approv'd  Your Pupils shall adore the Dame  Shall court her with a Lover's Flame  As  worthiest  to be lov'd  VIII  To make her Beauty more complete  The  Handmaid Sciences  shall wait  Around her Day and Night  To  polish  and  adorn  the Fair  To make her pleasing Charms appear  In more conspicuous Light  IX  Be VIRTUE then their  chief  Regard  For VIRTUE  is her own Reward    Were there  no other  giv'n  Let nothing  mean  their Souls entice  Teach them to tremble more at Vice  Than at the Bolts of Heav'n  X  For conscious  Merit  is a Meed  That amply crowns each honest Deed  With Joy of  acting well  While conscious  Guilt  allows no Rest  But stings and burns the Villain's Breast  Worse than the Flames of Hell  XI  A Sense of  Honour  and of  Shame    Will best your erring Youth reclaim  Whene'er they give Offence  By  gentle Methods  guide your School  Nor follow BUSBY's bloody Rule  To flog them into Sense  XII  No Be not rigid stern and sour  Display your  Mercy  more than  Pow'r    And imitate your  GOD  For Tyrants cannot be approv'd  They may be fear'd but never lov'd  Who daily use the Rod  XIII  Teach them a reasonable Awe  Of  true Religion  as by Law  Establish'd in the Land  Yet never puzzle  Truth  with  Lyes    But leave all heav'nly  Mysteries  For  Heav'n  to understand  XIV  Avoid the Rock where Thousands split  On purpose to  display  their  Wit    Or  Folly  to  expose    Where he who wrangles best confutes  And with rash Eloquence disputes  Of what he nothing knows  XV  Beware your Pupils tender Age  Imbibe no  superstitious  Rage  Which Fools Religion call  Such narrow Principles remove  Inculcate  universal Love    And  Charity  to all  XVI  Bid them assert their  Country's Cause    Teach them our  Government  and  Laws    All  servile  Precepts shun  Such as contriv'd by holy Knaves  Persuade us Subjects are but  Slaves    And  All  were made for  One  XVII  The  Law of Nature  Alluding to the  Law of Nature and Nations  lately publish'd by Dr  Turnbull  let them know  Instruct their Bosoms how to glow  And pant for  honest Fame    Make it their  Bus'ness  and  Delight  To vindicate the native Right  Which freeborn  Britons  claim  XVIII  Yet shun the furious Zeal of such  Who act the  Patriot  overmuch  And Monarchy invade  Who mindless of their  Laws  at  home    Would copy those of  Greece  and  Rome    Where  Commonwealthsmen  sway'd  XIX  Where  Civil Wars  were often wag'd  Where mad  Ambition  hotly rag'd  While  Public Spirit  cool'd  Where  Tyrants  now usurp'd Command  Where now a  Senate  sway'd the Land  And now a  Rabble  rul'd  XX  Where wanting  Pilots  at the Helm  To guide and moderate the Realm  The  Bark of State  was tost  By Waves of  Faction  toandfro  Sometimes too  high  sometimes too  low    And frequently was  lost  XXI  Our Fathers wisely dar'd to raise  Their Fabric on the  triple  Base  Of COMMONS LORDS and KING  And hence BRITANNIA's happy Fate  Hence all the Music of our State  Hence all our Blessings spring  XXII  We see a MONARCH grace the Throne  Who makes our Happiness his own  Our Property defends  Maintains in spite of  Party Hate    The  wellpois'd Balance  of the State  On which our Bliss depends  XXIII  Let HIM be chearfully obey'd  Instruct your Pupils how to aid  Their KING with loyal Care  That all may some Assistance yield  For  Council  these and those to wield  The  Thunder  of the  War  XXIV  So shall your SCHOOL increase each Day  And flourish like the verdant Bay  Or branching Vine in Spring  Your Youth be virtuously inclin'd  Be  real  PATRIOTS of Mankind  And loyal to their KING  XXV  But whither would my Thoughts aspire  Rash daring Muse resign the Lyre  For Shame be not so bold  Nor useless Hints to Him impart  Who knows so well to cast the Heart  In VIRTUE's genuine Mould  FINIS
