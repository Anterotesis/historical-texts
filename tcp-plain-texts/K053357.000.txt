 AN ENQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE  Frequent Executions at  TYBURN  c  AN ENQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE FREQUENT EXECUTIONS AT  TYBURN  AND A PROPOSAL  for some  REGULATIONS  concerning  FELONS  in  PRISON  and the good Effects to be Expected from them  To which is Added A Discourse on TRANSPORTATION and a Method to render that Punishment more Effectual  By  B MANDEVILLE  M D  Oderunt peccare Mali formidine Poenae  LONDON  Printed And Sold by  J Roberts  in  WarwickLane  MDCCXXV  THE PREFACE  _THE Design of this small Treatise is to lessen if not prevent the common Practice of Thieving and save many Lives of the loose and indigent Vulgar of which now such great Numbers are yearly lavish'd away for Trifles In order to this I have endeavour'd to set in a true Light the  destructive Consequences of  Theftbote  and the Damage the Publick sustains from the Trade that is drove by Thiefcatchers and the various ways now in vogue of compounding Felonies by which the Safety as well as Maintenance of Thieves and Pilferers are industriously taken care of and the Laws that enforce Prosecution altogether eluded  To the same Purpose I have pointed at the Licentiousness and other Disorders of  Newgate  arising from the wrong Method we have of treating common Felons in Prison I have describ'd the Transactions of Execution Day with the Procession to  Tyburn  and demonstrated what small Advantage they are of as well to the condemn'd themselves whose grand Affair it is to prepare  themselves for another World as to their Companions who should be deterred or the rest of the Spectators who should be struck with the Awfulness of the Solemnity I have likewise searched into the Origin of Courage and the wrong Judgments that are differently pass'd on the dying Behaviour of Malefactors shew'd the ill Consequences as well as Absurdity of our mistaking Drunkenness for Intrepidity and a senseless Deportment for Undauntedness and touch'd on the several Neglects and Mismanagements that are accessary and one way or other contribute to the Encrease and Support of Felons and consequently the Frequency of Executions Afterwards I have in a Chapter by it self offer'd some Proposals for a better Usage and more proper Treatment of  common Felons in Confinement and made a Pathetical Representation of the good Effects we might probably expect from such wholesome Regulations To these I have added a Discourse on Transportation and a Method of rendering that Punishment not only more effectual on the Criminals but likewise advantagious to the Publick in the most extraordinary manner  I am not so vain as to place any Merit in the Performance or promise my self the Applause of many on the contrary I expect to be censur'd and perhaps deservedly for the uncouth Decorations I have intermix'd with my Subject Men of Taste and Politeness will think themselves very little oblig'd to me for entertaining them with the  meanest and most abject part of low Life for almost a whole Chapter together and tell me that the Inside of  Newgate  either on an Execution Day or any other is not a Scene they ought to be troubled with and that the Exactness of a Picture among the Judicious is of little Worth where the noble manner is wanting To this I could answer that if I have trespassed against the Laws either of Elegance or Formality I was forc'd to it by what is superior to all Laws Necessity When a Man is to inspire his Readers with an Aversion to what they are unacquainted with he can never compass his End without furnishing them first with a general Idea of the Thing against which he wou'd raise their Indignation I could add that  when a Piece is lively and tolerably finish'd the goodnatured Critick will pardon the Meaness of the Design for the sake of the Colouring and the Application of the Master But if neither of these Excuses are thought sufficient I must plead guilty and confess that the Pleasure there is in imitating Nature in what Shape soever is so bewitching that it overrules the Dictates of Art and often forces us to offend against our own Judgment  As there are in this City not a few Men of Business and good Understanding whose Leisure allows them not to read much beyond the Publick News and most of them are concern'd in the Contents of this Pamphlet I caused the several Chapters of it to be Printed in  as many Papers of the  British  Journal imagining that its having been dispers'd and as it were advertis'd in that manner could give no Offence to the more Curious who would chuse to have it entire by it self and per use it in a Character less troublesome to the Eyes  In the first Chapter I should have taken notice of a Clause in an Act of Parliament that was made in the Fourth Year of His present Majesty and is call'd  An Act for the further Preventing Robbery Burglary and other Felcnies  c The candid Reader I hope will pardon the Neglect occasion'd by the small Acquaintance I have with the Law and give me leave in this Place to repair that Omission The Words are these  And whereas there are several Persons who have secret Acquaintance with  Felons  and who make it their Business to help Persons to their stollen Goods and by that Means gain Money from them which is divided between them and the  Felons  whereby they greatly encourage such Offenders  Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid  That whenever any Person taketh Money or Reward directly or indirectly under Pretence or upon account of helping any Person or Persons to any stollen Goods or Chattels every such Person so taking Money or  as aforesaid unless such Person  or cause to be apprehended  who stole the same and cause  to be brought to his Trial for the  give Evidence against him shall be guilty of  Felony  and suffer the Pains and Penalties of  Felony  according to the Felony committed in stealing such Goods and in such and the same manner as if such Offender had himself stole such Goods and Chattels in the manner and with such Circumstances as the same were stollen  Since the Printing of these Chapters in the Paper aforesaid I have likewise been inform'd that as receiving Money for assisting others in the Recovery of their stolen Goods is by this Act made Felony so by the known Rules of Law whoever is aiding and assisting thereto is of Course guilty as an Accessary and to incurr the same Punishment as the Principal and it cannot be doubted but that he who pays Money on such an Occasion is accessary to the Receiving of it which well deserves the Reflection of those who make no Scruple of redeeming the Goods that had been stolen from them as likewise does another Thing which is that if he who takes Money for stolen Goods is a principal Felon and that he who pays it is a Felon as being accessary  then he who by publick Advertisements with Promises of Secrecy and that no Questions shall be asked invites others to commit Felony is guilty of a great Misdemeanour tho' it produce no Effect but if it do the Person publishing such Advertisement will be an Accessary likewise  THE CONTENTS  CHAP I  OF  THEFTBOTE  or the Crime of Compounding of Felony  Page  CHAP II  Of the ill Consequences of

Metropolis has long been afflicting to Men of Pity and Humanity and continues to give great Uneasiness to every Person who has a Value for his Kind Many good Projects have been thought of to cure this Evil by sapping the Foundation of it A Society has been set up to reform our Manners and neither Workhouses nor Discipline on small Crimes have been wanting An Act has been made against prophane Cursing and Swearing and many Charity Schools have been erected But the Event has not answer'd hitherto the good Design of those Endeavours This City abounds as much with  loose lazy and dishonest Poor there is as much Mischief done by ordinary Felons and Executions for Theft and Burglary are as frequent at least as ever Nay it is believed that  London  is more pester'd with low Villany than any other Place whatever the Proportion of Bigness between them not left unconsider'd As there is no Effect without a Cause so something must be the Reason of this Calamity I have long and carefully examined into this Matter and am forced to ascribe the Mischief complained of to two palpable Evils distinct from those we have in common with other large overgrown Cities One regards Prosecutions the other the Treatment that is given to Malefactors after they are taken I shall begin with the first I mean the Neglect of them occasion'd by our shameful Negotiations with Thieves or their Agents for the Recovery of stolen Goods by which in Reality we become Aiders and Abetters to them  The Law of  England  is so tender of Mens Lives that whoever justly prosecutes and convicts a Person of a Capital Crime has nothing to answer for to his Conscience but on the contrary has done a Service to his Country without Offence to God or the least Breach of Charity to his Neighbour But as every Body has not Strength of Mind and Resolution enough to perform Duties that are repugnant to his Nature so making Allowances  for Human Frailties I could excuse the Backwardness of a meek homebred Person who should complain That to appear in open Court and speak before a Judge are terrible Things to him But I think it unpardonable that a Man should knowingly act against the Law and by so doing powerfully contribute to the Increase as well as Safety and Maintenance of Pilferers and Robbers from no other Principle than a criminal Selfishness accompany'd with an utter Disregard to the Publick Yet nothing is more common among us  This was wrote some Months before  Jonathan Wild  was apprehended  As soon as any Thing is missing suspected to be stolen the first Course we steer is directly to the Office of Mr  Jonathan Wild  If what we want is a Trinket either enamel'd or otherwise curiously wrought if there is Painting about it if it be a particular Ring the Gift of a Friend or any Thing which we esteem above the real Value and offer more for it than Mr  Thief  can make of it we are look'd upon as good Chaps and welcome to redeem it But if it be plain Gold or Silver we shall hardly see it again unless we pay the Worth of it Some Years ago it is true a Man might for half a Piece have fetch'd back a SnuffBox that weigh'd twenty or thirty Shillings But this was in the Infancy of the Establishment Now they are grown wiser and calculate exactly  what such a Thing will melt down for To offer less is thought unreasonable and unless Mr  Thiefcatcher  stands your Friend indeed if you have it you will seldom save any Thing but the Fashion If in this Place you can hear no Tidings of your Goods it is counted a Sign that they are in the Hands of irregular Practitioners that steal without Permission of the Board In this Case we immediately put in an Advertisement in some NewsPaper or other with a Promise that such a Reward will be given and no Questions asked I own that in the Printing of these short Epistles there is no manner of Harm if we abstract the Act itself from the Concern the Publick has in it The Tenor of them is rather benevolent than injurious And a Panegyrist on the present Times might justly say of them That in no Performances the true Spirit of Christianity was so conspicuous as in these That they were not only free from Calumny and ill Language but likewise so void of Reproach that speaking to a Thief we never call'd him so in those charitable Addresses That in them the very Catalogues of Injuries receiv'd were penn'd with as little Heat or Resentment as ever Tradesman shew'd in a Bill of Parcels directed to his best Customer That here we are so far from hating our Enemy that we proffer him a Recompence for his Trouble if he will condescend to let us have our own  again and leaving all Revenge to God to shew that we are willing to forgive and forget we consult in the most effectual Manner the Safety of a Person that deserves Hanging for the Wrong he has done us Yet notwithstanding the kind Constructions that may be put on these Civil Offers they all tend to the  Compounding of Felony  and are the Occasion of a double Mischief They invite the Indigent and Lazy to pick Pockets and render the Negligent more careless than probably they would be was this Practice abolish'd A PocketBook or Memorandum may be stole from a Man that is of vast Concern to him and yet of no Use but to the Owner If this be taken by a regular Thief a listed Pilferer it is easily recover'd for a small Reward I don't suppose any one so silly that therefore he would go to Places and into Companies on Purpose to have his Pocket pick'd but I can't help thinking that if those Things were never to be heard of again and the Loss irretrievable many young Rakes and other loose Reprobates would be under greater Apprehensions and more upon their Guard at least when they had such a Charge about them than the Generality of them now are And again if nothing could be made of Letters Papers and Things of that Nature such as have no known Worth and are not readily turned into Money the numbers of Whores and Rogues  young and old that are employ'd in the Diving Trade would decrease considerably many of them from a Principle of Prudence refusing to meddle with any Thing else For as on most of the Things now spoke of no real Value can be set the Punishment would be inconsiderable if any should the Things be found upon them or themselves be taken in the Fact Most Men will agree to all this whilst unconcern'd but when private Interest is touch'd it soon stifles these Considerations I should be a Fool says one when a Thing of Value is stolen from me not to get it back if I can for a Trifle If I lose a Sword or a Watch I must have another and to save the Fashion in these Things is considerable It is better to lose the Half than the Whole I have nothing to do with the Thief says another if I have my own again it is all I want What Good would it do to me to have a poor Fellow hang'd A Third more compassionate will tell us that if he knew the Thief he would not meddle with him and that he would lose ten times the Value of what has been taken from him rather than be the Occasion of a Man's Death To these I reply that the Legislators seem to have known how the Generality of Men would argue and what Excuses they would make they had an Eye on the Frailty of our Nature consider'd that all Prosecutions are troublesome  and often very expensive that most Men preferred their own Interest their Ease and Pleasure to any Regard of the Publick and therefore they provided against our Passions with so much Severity  Compounding of Felony  is not prohibited under a small Penalty or attoned for by a little Fine it is next to Felony and the most creditable Citizen that is convicted of it ceases to be an honest Man  The Offence in our Law is call'd THEFTBOTE of which my Lord Chief Justice  Coke  says  That it is an Offence beyond Misprision of Felony for that is only a bare Concealment of his bare Knowledge But that it is THEFTBOTE when the Owner not only knows of the Felony but takes of the Thief his Goods again or Amends for the same to favour or maintain him that is not to prosecute him to the Intent he may escape The Punishment of THEFTBOTE is Ransom and Imprisonment  THEFTBOTE as described by Act of Parliament  est emenda furti capta absque consideratione curiae domini regis  Sir  Matthew Hale  in his  Pleas of the Crown  says  That THEFTBOTE is more than a bare Misprision of Felony and is where the Owner doth not only know the Felony but takes his Goods again or other Amends not to prosecute  This Rigour of the Legislature is a full Demonstration that they thought it a Crime of the most pernicious Consequence to the Society yet it is become familiar to us and our Remissness in several Matters relating to Felons is not to be parallell'd in any other civiliz'd Nation That Rogues should be industriously dispers'd throughout the City and Suburbs that different Hours and Stations should be observ'd among them and regular Books kept of stollen Goods that the Superintendent in this hopeful Oeconomy should almost every Sessions for a Reward betray prosecute and hang one or more of this his Acquaintance and at the same Time keep on his Correspondence amongst the Survivors whom one after another he sends all to their Triangular Home that Magistrates should not only know and see this but likewise continue to make use of such a Person for an Evidence and in a manner own that they are beholden to him in the Administration of Justice That I say all these Things should be Facts is something very extraordinary in the Principal City and the Home Management of a Kingdom so formidable abroad and of such Moment in the Balance of  Europe  as that of  Great Britain  The Mischief that one Man can do as a Thief is a very Trifle to what he may be the Occasion of as an Agent or Concealer of Felons  The longer this Practice continues the more the Number of Rogues must hourly encrease and therefore it is high Time that regular Bookkeeping of stolen Goods should cease and that all Gangs and Knots of Thieves should be broke and destroy'd as much as is possible at least none of them suffer'd to form themselves into Societies that are under Discipline and act by Order of a Superior It is highly criminal in any Man for Lucre to connive at a Piece of Felony which he could have hinder'd But a profess'd ThiefCatcher above all ought to be severely punish'd if it can be proved that he has suffer'd a known Rogue to go on in his Villany tho' but one Day after it was in his Power to apprehend and convict him more especially if it appears that he was a Sharer in the Profit  CHAP II  Of the ill Consequences of  THEFTBOTE  and the Licentiousness of Felons in  Newgate  OFTEN when I have spoke against  Theftbote  after the same manner as now I have been writing I have heard Men of Worth and good Sense come into my Sentiments who yet after all would tell me That if I  had lost any Thing myself they believ'd that I would be glad to have it again with as little Cost and Trouble as I could This I never denied and am still willing to own We are all partial and unfit Judges in our own Cause but the most that can be made of this is That in that Case neither I nor any Body else that has had any Thing stolen from him ought to be consulted about the Matter We are ill qualified and therefore incapable of determining any Thing rightly concerning it I have another Reason why this ought to be referred rather to those who never lost any Thing by Thieves and Pilferers than others who have been Sufferers that Way Rogues it  s true have a thousand Stratagems and a  may be very careful and yet have his Pocket pick'd if ever he appears in the Street or a Crowd Yet if we divide Mankind into two Classes that the one will be more exempt from those Misfortunes than the other is undeniable A Man who is always upon his Guard in the Streets and suspects all Crowds that is temperate in his Liquor avoids as much as is possible unseasonable Hours never gives Ear to Nightwalkers a Man that abroad is always watchful over himself and every Thing about him and at home takes Care of his Doors and Bolts his Shutters Locks and Bars such a one I say is in less Danger than others who are unthinking and never mind what Companies  they thrust themselves into or such as will be drunk go home late in the dark unattended and scruple not to talk and converse with lewd Women as they meet them or that are careless of themselves as well as of the securing and fastening of their Houses It is evident then which Class would yield the most proper Judges whom if it was left to I don't question but the sober careful and wiser Part of the Nation would agree that the Practice in vogue and Method made use of to recover stolen Goods even tho' there was no express Law against it is on many Accounts mischievous to the Publick and visibly destructive to the Interest of honest Property and our Security in the Enjoyment of it  There is no greater Encouragement for Men to follow any Labour or Handicraft than that they are paid as soon as they have done their Work without any further Trouble It is from such a Consideration as this that to encrease the publick Security the Law not only punishes Stealing but likewise makes it Felony knowingly to buy stolen Goods and moreover perpetuates honest Property and renders the Right of it inalienable from the injured Owner who seizes his Goods in what Hands soever he finds them These two additional Precautions are of admirable Use in hampering common Villains and strengthening the Law against Theft From  the first a Rogue after he has made himself liable to be hang'd may be still disappointed and miss his chief Aim for as Money is what he wants if no Body will purchase what he offers he is never the nearer The Second makes that he is never safe tho' he is rid of the Goods and the Money in his Pocket for tho' they are gone through half a Dozen Hands as soon as the Right Owner lays Claim to the Things stole every one is oblig'd to discover where he had them and by this Means it is seldom difficult to find out the Thief or the Receiver of stolen Goods To leap these two Barriers and free himself at once of the Trouble there is in finding a safe Purchaser and all Apprehensions of future Danger a Rogue could not with or imagine any Thing more effectual than that he might lodge what he has stole in the Hands of the Owner himself and so receive a Reward for his Pains and at the same Time a Pardon for his Crime of him whose Prosecution was the only Thing he had to fear It is evident then that the friendly Commerce and amicable Negotiations now in vogue between Thieves and those that are robb'd by them are the greatest Encouragement of low Villany that can be invented and as sure a Way to keep up the Breed of Rogues and promote the Interest of them as either our Fishery or the Coal Trade are constant Nurseries for Sailors  I am not ignorant that in the present Conjuncture as Cases might be stated it would be very harsh and seem to be the Height of Injustice if we should hinder People from redeeming stolen Goods on all Emergencies whatever A Man may be vigilant and careful and his Servants the same and yet their Eyes being one Moment turn'd from the Counter a ShopBook may be snatched and carried off perhaps a Month before  Christmas  This may put a Tradesman of good Business in great Distress Must he lose it I say Yes if the Publick is to be preferr'd to a private Interest In the mean time I know very well what every Body would do in that Case But that the Whole suffers by the Redemption I prove thus Let us say that this Year twelve ShopBooks are stole that are all recover'd for two or three Guineas apiece got for them and no Body punish'd You may expect that next Year you will have forty or fifty stole and in a few Years nothing will be more common And again let us suppose that last Year an hundred ShopBooks were stole but by vertue of some effectual Law for that Purpose not one redeemed The Consequence in all Probability would be that the next Year you would hardly have ten ShopBooks stole and if thro' the strict Observance of the Law none of them likewise should be redeem'd you would hear no more of that Practice  Besides when a Man steals what is of no Value but to me and can have no other View than that I should redeem it and be his PayMaster myself the Felony becomes in a manner a compound Action in which as soon as I comply I join with the Thief And if we consider that the changing of Property from one Man to another is seldom of any Consequence to the Publick and that all the Mischief that can befal it from Theft that is the Loss of Goods that Way sustain'd by private Persons consists in this That those who committed it gain their Point and come off with Impunity let who will be the Thief or the Receiver if I say we consider these two Things it will appear that in the Case I have mentioned myself who for my own Ends assisted the Thief with Money and secured him from Prosecution had the greatest Share in the Transaction and consequently was of the two the most injurious to the civil Society Without me the Rogue would not only have been disappointed but likewise whilst he continued in Possession of the Thing stole remained in the perpetual Dread of being prosecuted for what he never had any Benefit from and it is not probable that a Man who had been twice so served would ever make such another Attempt  These Things well deserve the Consideration of wise Men and I desire the compassionate Part of Mankind to reflect on what daily  Experience teaches us of common Felons and they will easily find out that unseasonable Pity may prove the greatest Cruelty The oftner a young Rogue steals with Impunity the sooner he'll be a thoroughpaced Villain that will venture on more hazardous Undertakings and the more numerous the Examples of such are the more loose People will enter into the Fraternity of which whether it be great or small very few ever arrive to a middle Age Some are cunning enough never to be taken in a Fact but no Subtlety can save them from the Impeachment of others A licens'd Practitioner may be skreen'd and protected some Years if he sticks to Discipline and pays the greatest Part of his Earnings for his Security but if he rides resty and squabbles about the Contribution required of him he is in a dangerous Way It is possible that a dextrous Youth may be esteemed and be a Favourite to the Superintendent a great while but when he grows very notorious he is hunted like a Deer and the Premium on his Head betrays him He may baffle his Prosecutor find a Flaw in an Indictment elude the Force of an Evidence come off once or twice be reprieved break Goal or be pardoned the Gallows will be his Portion at last The Wretch that is train'd up to stealing is the Property of the Hangman He can never entirely leave off his Trade Many after Transportation have  with great Hazard of their Lives found the Way back again to  Newgate  A Thief bred must be hang'd if he lives  From all which appears what I undertook to prove That Remissness as to Prosecutions occasion'd by the barefaced Compositions of Felony is one of the grand Causes of that lamentable Complaint the Frequency of Executions and should we compare the Droves that are carried to  Tyburn  for Slaughter with those others that are sent to  Smithfield  for the same Purpose we would find the modern ThiefCatcher subservient to the Executioner in the same Manner as the wealthy Grazier is to the needy Butcher and thatofthe Cattle in either Sense few are kill'd by the one that were never cherish'd by the other  I am now come to the second Cause which is the Treatment Felons receive after they are taken both in  Newgate  and their Journey from thence to the Gallows First It is wrong to suffer such Numbers of them to be and converse together for nothing but the utmost Corruption can be expected from a Company of forty or fifty People in a Prison who every one of them singly consider'd were all the worst of Thousands before they met Secondly It is an Encouragement to Vice that the most dissolute of both Sexes and generally young People too should live promiscuously in the same Place and have Access to one another For the rest the Licentiousness  of the Place is abominable and there are no low Jests so filthy no Maxims so destructive to good Manners or Expressions so vile and prophane but what are utter'd there with Applause and repeated with Impunity They eat and drink what they can purchase every Body has Admittance to them and they are debarr'd from nothing but going out Their most serious Hours they spend in mock Tryals and instructing one another in cross Questions to confound Witnesses and all the Stratagems and Evasions that can be of Service to elude the Charge that shall be made against them or else in reading Lectures on some Branch or other of their Profession the various Arts and Methods of Stealing or the Glory as well as Usefulness of invincible Impudence on all offensive and defensive Emergencies As villainous Pawnbrokers and all Receivers of stolen Goods have good Reasons to be liberal to those they have dealt with when in this Distress so no Felons are here in Want and reduced to the Allowance of the Prison but Novices and silly Creatures that have the least deserved to be punish'd whereas the Veteran Rogues and such as have been great Traders are well provided for This keeps them up in Debauchery and many after Condemnation persist in their riotous Courses and pampering their Bodies whilst the Care that is taken of their Souls is very mean For such is the Noise  and Confusion all around them that even the best dispos'd have not sufficient Opportunities to prepare themselves for another World and the Helps they receive in Spirituals are all Things consider'd no better than the Accounts we have of them after every Session  CHAP III  Of Execution Day the Journey to  Tyburn  and a Word in behalf of Anatomical Dissections  WHEN the Day of Execution is come among extraordinary Sinners and Persons condemned for their Crimes who have but that Morning to live one would expect a deep Sense of Sorrow with all the Signs of a thorough Contrition and the utmost Concern that either Silence or a sober Sadness should prevail and that all who had any Business there should be grave and serious and behave themselves at least with common Decency and a Deportment suitable to the Occasion But the very Reverse is true The horrid Aspects of Turnkeys and Gaolers in Discontent and Hurry the sharp and dreadful Looks of Rogues that beg in Irons but would rob you with greater Satisfaction if they could the Bellowings of half a dozen Names at a time that are perpetually  made in the Enquiries after one another the Variety of strong Voices that are heard of howling in one Place scolding and quarrelling in another and loud Laughter in a third the substantial Breakfasts that are made in the midst of all this the Seas of Beer that are swill'd the neverceasing Outcries for more and the bawling Answers of the Tapsters as continual the Quantity and Varieties of more entoxicating Liquors that are swallow'd in every Part of  Newgate  the Impudence and unseasonable Jests of those who administer them their black Hands and Nastiness all over all these joined together are astonishing and terrible without mentioning the Oaths and Imprecations that from every Corner are echo'd about for Trifles or the little light and general Squallor of the Gaol itself accompany'd with the melancholy Noise of Fetters differently sounding according to their Weight But what is most shocking to a thinking Man is the Behaviour of the Condemn'd whom for the greatest Part you'll find either drinking madly or uttering the vilest Ribaldry and jeering others that are less impenitent whilst the Ordinary bustles among them and shifting from one to another distributes Scraps of good Counsel to unattentive Hearers and near him the Hangman impatient to be gone swears at their Delays and as fast as he can does his Part in preparing them for their Journey  At last out they set and with them a Torrent of Mob bursts thorough the Gate Amongst the lower Rank and working People the idlest and such as are most fond of making Holidays with Prentices and Journeymen to the meanest Trades are the most honourable Part of these floating Multitudes All the rest are worse The Days being known beforehand they are a Summons to all Thieves and Pickpockets of both Sexes to meet Great Mobs are a Safeguard to one another which makes these Days Jubilees on which old Offenders and all who dare not shew their Heads on any other venture out of their Holes and they resemble Free Marts where there is an Amnesty for all Outlaws All the Way from  Newgate  to  Tyburn  is one continued Fair for Whores and Rogues of the meaner Sort Here the most abandon'd Rakehells may light on Women as shameless Here Trollops all in Rags may pick up Sweethearts of the same Politeness And there are none so lewd so vile or so indigent of either Sex but at the Time and Place aforesaid they may find a Paramour Where the Croud is the least which among the Itinerants is no where very thin the Mob is the rudest and here jostling one another and kicking Dirt about are the most innocent Pastimes Now you see a Man without Provocation push his Companion in the Kennel and two Minutes after the Sufferer  trip up the other's Heels and the first Aggressor lies rolling in the more solid Mire And he is the prettiest Fellow among them who is the least shock'd at Nastiness and the most boisterous in his Sports No modern Rabble can long subsist without their darling Cordial the grand Preservative of Sloth  Jeneva  that infallible Antidote against Care and frugal Reflexion which being repeated removes all Pain of sober Thought and in a little Time cures the tormenting Sense of the most pressing Necessities The Traders who vent it among the Mob on these Occasions are commonly the worst of both Sexes but most of them weatherbeaten Fellows that have misspent their Youth Here stands an old Sloven in a Wig actually putrify'd squeez'd up in a Corner and recommends a Dram of it to the Goersby There another in Rags with several Bottles in a Basket stirs about with it where the Throng is the thinnest and tears his Throat with crying his Commodity and further off you may see the Head of a third who has ventur'd in the Middle of the Current and minds his Business as he is fluctuating in the irregular Stream Whilst higher up an old decrepit Woman sits dreaming with it on a Bulk and over against her in a Soldier's Coat her termagant Daughter sells the SotsComfort with great Dispatch The intelligible Sounds that are heard among them are Oaths and vile Expressions with  Wishes of Damnation at every other Word pronounced promiscuously against themselves or those they speak to without the least Alteration in the Meaning  As these undisciplined Armies have no particular Enemies to encounter but Cleanliness and good Manners so nothing is more entertaining to them than the dead Carcasses of Dogs and Cats or for want of them Rags and all Trompery that is capable of imbibing Dirt These well trampled in Filth and if possible of the worst sort are by the Ringleaders flung as high and as far as a strong Arm can carry them and commonly directed where the Throng is the thickest Whilst these illboding Meteors are shooting thro' the Air the Joy and Satisfaction of the Beholders is visible in every Countenance and Gesture and more audibly express'd by the great Shouts that accompany them in their Course and as the Projectiles come nearer the Earth are turn'd into loud Laughter which is more or less violent in Proportion to the Mischief promis'd by the Fall And to see a good Suit of Cloaths spoiled by this Piece of Gallantry is the tiptop of their Diversion which they seldom go home without enjoying For tho' no People in their Senses would venture among them on Foot in any tolerable Dress yet there are young Rakes of Fortune who care not what they lavish or destroy Of these the maddest sort  will often after a Night's Debauch mix with Crowds and thrust themselves in the midst of the most abominable Rabble where they seldom fail of meeting with such Adventures  Tho' before setting out the Prisoners took care to swallow what they could to be drunk and stifle their Fear yet the Courage that strong Liquors can give wears off and the Way they have to go being considerable they are in Danger of recovering and without repeating the Dose Sobriety would often overtake them For this Reason they must drink as they go and the Cart stops for that Purpose three or four and sometimes half a dozen Times or more before they come to their Journey's End These Halts always encrease the Numbers about the Criminals and more prodigiously when they are very notorious Rogues The whole March with every Incident of it seems to be contrived on Purpose to take off and divert the Thoughts of the Condemned from the only Thing that should employ them Thousands are pressing to mind the Looks of them Their  quondam  Companions more eager than others break through all Obstacles to take Leave And here you may see young Villains that are proud of being so if they knew any of the Malefactors tear the Cloaths off their Backs by squeezing and creeping thro' the Legs of Men and Horses to shake Hands with him  and not to lose before so much Company the Reputation there is in having had such a valuable Acquaintance It is ineredible what a Scene of Confusion all this often makes which yet grows worse near the Gallows and the violent Efforts of the most sturdy and resolute of the Mob on one Side and the potent Endeavours of rugged Goalers and others to beat them off on the other the terrible Blows that are struck the Heads that are broke the Pieces of swingeing Sticks and Blood that fly about the Men that are knock'd down and trampled upon are beyond Imagination whilst the Dissonance of Voices and the Variety of Outcries for different Reasons that are heard there together with the Sound of more distant Noises make up a Discord not to be parallel'd If we consider besides all this the mean Equipages of the Sheriffs Officers and the scrubby Horses that compose the Cavalcade the Irregularity of the March and the Want of Order among all the Attendants we shall be forced to confess that these Processions are very void of that decent Solemnity that would be required to make them awful At the very Place of Execution the most remarkable Scene is a vast Multitude on Foot intermixed with many Horsemen and HackneyCoaches all very dirty or else cover'd with Dust that are either abusing one another or else staring at the Prisoners among whom there is commonly  very little Devotion and in that which is practis'd and dispatch'd there of Course there is as little good Sense as there is Melody It is possible that a Man of extraordinary Holiness by anticipating the Joys of Heaven might embrace a violent Death in such Raptures as would dispose him to the singing of Psalms But to require this Exercise or expect it promiscuously of every Wretch that comes to be hang'd is as wild and extravagant as the Performance of it is commonly frightful and impertinent Besides this there is always at that Place such a mixture of Oddnesses and Hurry that from what passes the best dispos'd Spectator seldom can pick out any thing that is edifying or moving  Here I must observe that the Possibility of Pardons and Reprieves that often come very late and which with or without Grounds most Criminals continue to hope for 'till they are hang'd is another great Clog that keeps attach'd to the World those that are less abandon'd and more relenting than the Generality of them and who without that Hindrance would in all Probability prepare themselves for certain Death which overtakes many whilst they are still doubting of it The Ordinary and Executioner having performed their different Duties with small Ceremony and equal Concern seem to be tired and glad it is over  The Tragedy being ended the next Entertainment is a Squabble between the Surgeons and the Mob about the dead Bodies of the Malefactors that are not to be hanged in Chains They have suffer'd the Law cries the Rabble and shall have no other Barbarities put upon them We know what you are and will not leave them before we see them buried If the others are numerous and resolute enough to persist in their Enterprize a Fray ensues From whence I shall take an Opportunity of saving something upon the Occasion of it I have no Design that savours of Cruelty or even Indecency towards a human Body but shall endeavour to demonstrate that the superstitious Reverence of the Vulgar for a Corpse even of a Malefactor and the strong Aversion they have against dissecting them are prejudicial to the Publick For as Health and sound Limbs are the most desirable of all Temporal Blessings so we ought to encourage the Improvement of Physick and Surgery wherever it is in our Power The Knowledge of Anatomy is inseparable from the Studies of either and it is almost impossible for a Man to understand the Inside of our Bodies without having seen several of them skilfully dissected Kings and Princes are open'd and have their Hearts and Bowels taken out and embalm'd It is not then Ignominious much less offensive to the dead Body which may be interred with as  much Decency after Dissection as if it never had been touch'd But suppose that many of our common Thieves were not to be buried at all and some of them made Skeletons and that several Parts of others variously prepared should be preserved for the Instruction of Students What if it was a Disgrace to the surviving Relations of those who had Lectures read upon their Bodies and were made use of for Anatomical Preparations The Dishonour would seldom reach beyond the Scum of the People and to be dissected can never be a greater Scandal than being hanged The University of  Leyden  in  Holland  have a Power given them by the Legislature to demand for this Purpose the Bodies of ordinary Rogues executed within that Province but with us it is the general Complaint of all Professors of Anatomy that they can get none to dissect Where then shall we find a readier Supply and what Degree of People are fitter for it than those I have named When Persons of no Possessions of their own that have slipp'd no Opportunity of wronging whomever they could die without Restitution indebted to the Publick ought not the injur'd Publick to have a Title to and the Disposal of what the others have left And is any Thing more reasonable than that they should enjoy that Right especially when they only make use of it for commendable Purposes What is done  for the common Good every Member of the Society may at one time or other receive an Advantage from and therefore quarrelsome People that love fighting act very preposterously and inconsistent with their Interest when they venture to have their Bones broke for endeavouring to deprive Surgeons of the Means to understand the Structure of them  CHAP IV  Of the wrong Judgments that are pass'd on the dying Behaviour of Malefactors  HAVING finish'd the Picture I proposed to draw of modern Executions and the Crowds that usually attend them I shall make some Remarks on the Judgments that are commonly pass'd on the dying Behaviour of our ordinary Felons In a rich and potent Kingdom where worldly Glory is not in Contempt and to think meanly of our selves seldom taught by Example whatever it may be by Precept nothing is counted more provoking or less to be born with Patience than to be called a Coward The vilest Rogues and most despicable Villains may own a thousand Crimes and often brag of the most abominable Actions but there is scarce one who will confess that he has no Courage Our general Esteem for Valour  which is demonstrable from what I have said as it is of great Use to a warlike Nation is very commendable and Fortitude ought ever to keep its Place amongst the Cardinal Virtues But the Notions which the Vulgar have of Courage as well as Honour and Shame are full of dangerous Errors Compliments as well as Reproaches when ill applied are often the Causes of great Mischief and I am persuaded that the Perverseness of Opinion now reigning amongst us both in applauding and discommending the Conduct of Criminals in their last Hours is an accessary Evil that very much contributes to what is the Subject of our grand Complaint the Frequency of Executions To explain my self on this Matter in the clearest Manner I am able I beg leave to begin with it from the Bottom  In all living Creatures that fall under our Senses we perceive an Instinct of SelfPreservation and the more sensible they are the greater Aversion they discover to the Dissolution of their Being Man the most perfect of them sets an inestimable Value on Life and knows no Fear equal to the Horror he has against Death This is to be understood only of Man in the State of Nature before he has made Reflections on himself and what he sees of the Creation but when after that his Reason demonstrates to him that there must have been a first Cause that the  World is govern'd by an intelligent Being that himself a Compound of Soul and Body is indebted to that Being for all he enjoys and that there is a strong Probability of a Life after this When moreover he considers himself as incorporated in a Community of vast Numbers that all together make one Body politick the Welfare of which he finds universally esteemed as a Concern superior to all others When I say he finds and reflects on all this he plainly sees that the Fear of Death must on many Accounts be prejudicial to the publick Good and common Security in which he has a Share It is a Virtue then to conquer it and if we inspect into the early Oeconomy of all Nations we shall find that the most powerful Motives made use of to induce Man to lessen this Fear and moderate the Fondness which Nature has given us of Life had their Origin from Religion or a publick Spirit that is in other Words from a Representation of his Duty either to God or his Country Thus holy Martyrs have suffer'd with Fortitude for their Faith and in Confidence of eternal Happiness hasten'd to Death with Alacrity and even rejoiced in the Midst of Flames And thus there have been valiant Men in all Ages that have exposed themselves to the greatest Hazards in Defence of their Laws and Liberties and animated by a zealous Love for their Country sacrific'd their Lives  to the publick Welfare As Men of this Sort have every where deservedly gained the general Applause and the Virtue they are possess'd of has been honoured by the Name of Courage so on the contrary the Fearful and Pusillanimous that ever prefer their own Safety to all other Considerations and are therefore never to be relied upon are as justly despis'd and the ignominious Word by which we reproach the Vice that enslaves them is Cowardice  From what has been said it is evident that the original Reason why Courage is generally esteemed is because it is taken for granted that both the Principle we act from and the End we labour for in conquering our Fears are praiseworthy and have a visible Tendency either to the Good of others or our own spiritual Felicity Nothing therefore is more unjust than that we should continue our Esteem for Valour when it degenerates and both the Motive Men set out with and the Scope they aim at are palpably destructive Anger Pride Envy and several other Passions are capable of subduing Fear But as these Principles are evil in themselves so it is impossible that the End to be obtain'd by them should be commendable What perverse and miserable Judges are we then that applaud a Person's Intrepidity in fighting a Duel when in the Act itself we see him willfully violate the Laws of God and Man  But should human Honour here break in upon me and my Reasoning how right soever be overpower'd by the irresistable Clamour of the fashionable World what can be said for the senseless Intimidity of a vulgar Rogue who not only professes an utter Disregard to Honour and Conscience but has likewise at his first Setting out as a Preliminary to his Business disclaim'd all Pretences to common Honesty Why should we delight in the Intrepidity tho' it was real of a Villain in his Impiety Why should Christians be pleased to see a great Sinner give up his Ghost impenitent or imagine that he dies bravely because he bids Defiance to Heaven and boldly plunges himself into an Abyss of eternal Misery Yet nothing is more common amongst us And the further a Man is removed from Repentance nay the more void he seems to be of all Religion and the less Concern he discovers for Futurity the more he is admired by our sprightly People Whereas he who shews but the least Sorrow for his Sins or by his Tears or Dismality of Gestures lets us know that he is under Apprehensions of the divine Wrath is a weak silly Creature not worth looking at And he only in the Opinion of many dies like a Man who in reality goes off most like a Brute But some of my Readers perhaps will have nothing to do with Christianity Suppose then we lay by that Consideration  I grant that to subdue the Terrors of Death is a manifest Token of Intrepidity and promise to pay Homage to true Courage wheresoever I can meet with it only let us not be imposed upon but try the Valour of this undaunted Hero whether it be genuine No Man can conquer the Fear of Death but by something superior to it What is the Power that supports him in the Conflict and what Principle does he act from It is not his Innocence for his Guilt is publick and his Crimes are proved upon him It is not Zeal for Religion nor the Love of his Country He pretends to neither Yet it must be some mighty Principle of vast Force and Efficacy for if he acts consistently he despises not only Death but the Wrath of Omnipotence and a Punishment just at Hand that shall be everlasting Will you say that he firmly believes that there is no God nor Life after this and that Man is wholly mortal Suppose it that's no Support against Death itself But look narrowly into him and you will alter your Opinion even as to that The Enthusiasm of Atheists has other Symptoms deplorable as it is the Appearance of it is more sedate and they make some Pretences to Reasoning But what Probability is there that a poor Rascal who was brought up in Ignorance and perhaps cannot read one who never troubled his Head with thinking much less with thinking on abstruse Matters  and Metaphysicks should so far lose himself in the Mazes of Philosophy as to become a speculative Atheist  Since then we can find no Principle from which it is possible a common Villain should derive his Undauntedness it is evident that what we see is spurious and the Bravery we admire only counterfeited and false at Bottom The Terror of Death inwardly excruciates him But his Fear of shewing this of being called a Coward and laugh'd at by his Companions has some Command over his outward Appearance therefore not to be found out sometimes he swears or scoffs at Religion at others he mixes forc'd Laughter with the vilest Language and trys all the Strength of Brutality to keep down a struggling Conscience and appear more atheistical and obdurate than to his Sorrow he feels himself to be But his Impudence would soon fail him and his inexhaustible Stock be but a weak Match for the Agonies he suffers if he took not Refuge in strong Liquors These are his only Support and Drunkenness the Cause of his Intrepidity Should I be told that in many of them no Signs are seen either of Fear or Ebriety it would be of no Force against my Assertion As great Fear sinks so hard Drinking raises the Spirits They are two Enemies that when equally match'd may by mutual Conflict easily disarm and hinder the Operations of each other Let a  curious Observer mind the continual Changes of the Prisoner's unsettled Behaviour the wild Manner of his Actions and above all the greedy Haste with which he throws down every Thing potable and intoxicating and he will soon perceive that our ShamHero drinks neither with Comfort nor for Pleasure and seems to expect no other Benefit from it than that it may take away his Senses and hinder him from thinking Are not they fine Judges who are imposed upon by such pusillanimous Wretches that are so far from having conquer'd the Fear of Death that they go out of the World without having ever dared one Moment soberly to think of it and of whom it can only be said that they died hard and unmov'd because they were senseless and with the Courage of a Stone suffer'd themselves without Thought to drop into Eternity  The Mischief that these Patterns of Impenitence together with the Applause that is given them must produce in a vast and opulent City will appear from the following Consideration It is necessary to the publick Peace and Security that Burglary Robbing in the Streets or on the Highway and all those Crimes where Violence is mix'd with Injustice should be capitally punish'd But considering on the one hand how much more prone Men are to Ease and Pleasure than they are to Industry and Labour and  on the other the Generality of human Wants and the unequal Distributions of Fortune to supply them it must be acknowledg'd that where Men are without Shame and Education and consequently not affected with the Ties either of Honour or Religion Poverty itself is a strong Temptation to Thieving when Opportunities offer The greatest Charity therefore and Compassion we can shew to our FellowCreatures is an extraordinary Severity and neverceasing Watchfulness in a Government against the first Approaches of Dishonesty It is with this View that the Provision of the Legislature that such Offenders should be punish'd with Death is to be vindicated tho' the Punishment is greater than the Laws framed by God himself for the  Jewish  Commonwealth inflicted or what natural Justice proportioning the Punishment to the Crime seems to require For it is not the Death of those poor Souls that is chiefly aim'd at in Executions but the Terror we would have it strike in others of the same loose Principles And for the same Reason these Executions are little better than Barbarity and sporting away the Lives of the indigent Vulgar if those valuable Sacrifices we are obliged to make to the publick Safety are render'd insignificant If no Remedy can be found for these Evils it would be better that Malefactors should be put to Death in private for our publick Executions are  become Decoys that draw in the Necessitous and in effect as cruel as frequent Pardons instead of giving Warning they are examplary the wrong Way and encourage where they should deter The small Concern and seeming Indolence of the Condemn'd harden the Profligates that behold them and confirm to them by ocular Demonstration what they encourage one another with in viler Language low as it is permit me to mention it  That there is nothing in being hang'd but awry Neck and a wet pair of Breeches  CHAP V  Of Regulations concerning  FELONS  in Prison and the good Effects to be expected from them  WHAT has been said in the foregoing Chapters in relation to common  Felons  has pointed at the evil Customs Mismanagements and perverse Opinions that prevail amongst us I shall now conclude what I proposed to publish on this Subject with offering some Proposals towards a better Usage of them in Prison and the good Effect such Alterations in all Probability would produce All which without Arrogance or Presumption I submit to better Judgment  First  I would have every one of the Malefactors lock'd up by himself and they should  never be suffer'd to converse together It would not be a very great Expence where Chimneys convenient Windows Order and Beauty would be out of the Question to build an hundred small Rooms perhaps of twelve Foot Square that would be strong beyond the Possibility of being forced by naked Hands and to prevent all Hopes of breaking Goal I would have it a Custom made to search suspected or not all Prisoners and the Places they are in every Night before Bedtime The Rooms I speak of I would rather have obscure than otherwise and the small Light they had far beyond Reach They should all have such Conveniencies that those who were shut up in them should during their Stay have no Occasion to stir out of them on any Account Thus we might secure Prisoners without galling them with Irons before we are sure that they deserve to be punish'd at all  Secondly  I would have a Law made to fix a certain number of Days after which the Condemned should not have the Benefit of Pardons or Reprieves tho' they might be obtain'd This Time elaps'd they should have one Day to bid farewell to Friends and Relations After which they should have three times four and twenty Hours allow'd them for no other Purpose than to make their Peace with Heaven and prepare themselves for Death During this time they should be  inaccessible to all but a sober Keeper to take Care of them and a Clergyman to assist them in Spirituals And here I beg leave to observe that Men of Reputation who live in Credit and by their Learning or exemplary Lives have acquired the Publick Esteem are fitter for this Task than others of small Parts and no Repute that labouring under narrow Circumstances for a poor Salary and some miserable Perquisites take upon them this weighty Province as a Livelihood and Business to be constantly follow'd The more Respect and Reverence are paid to Divines and the higher their Dignity is the greater Opportunity they have of making themselves serviceable in every Branch of their Function but more especially that Part of it now under Consideration In other Protestant Countries beyond Sea the Ministers of the National Church perform this Office either by Turns or as the Criminal and sometimes the Magistrate desire it In most Employments Use makes Perfectness but here it incapacitates and was a Man even of the greatest Prudence and Watchfulness over himself always to converse with Rogues and do nothing else but instruct and attend Malefactors in their last Hours the very Habit he would contract from it would spoil him for that Purpose And it is impossible but constant Practice wou'd in a little Time wear out or at least take off the greatest Part of that  Earnestness and Concern which ought to be inseparable from the Charge I speak of  The greater Provision we made for the Souls and future Happiness of these shortliv'd Sinners the less Indulgence we should have for their Bodies and sensual Appetites And I would have it strictly observed that from the Moment their Death was fixed 'till their Execution they should receive nothing for Sustenance but Bread and Water and of either what they would I would moreover have it enacted That every Year a certain number of dead Bodies not under six should be allowed to Physicians and Surgeons for Anatomical Uses not to be made choice of till after Death in such a Manner that no Felon could be sure this would not be his Lot  If they should complain that the miserable Diet they were confined to was a Severity that disturbed their Thoughts and hinder'd their Devotion it would be a Sign that their Minds were not yet turned the right Way But this Grievance a short Time and Necessity will never fail to cure The harsher that Article may seem the more Efficacy it would be of in deterring Rogues from Mischief For I do not doubt but most of them would look upon the wholsome Regulations in Prison here mentioned as the most considerable Part of the Punishment they were to suffer though I confess that what I have in View bythis low Diet chiefly regards the eternal  Welfare of those unhappy People as it would be instrumental to an early Repentance When free from Fumes of Food and all intoxicating Comforts the serious Thoughts of a Criminal shall be obliged to dwell upon his wretched Self and behold the Prospect of a future State so near so certainly to come the loosest and most abandon'd will be brought to Reason Death being unavoidable and nothing upon Earth to save him Selfdefence will make him turn his Eyes elsewhere His continued Abstinence will help to clear his Understanding then searching after Truth he will be soon convinced of the Folly and Weakness of those Arguments by which he had been used to harden his Conscience keep out Remorse and fortify his Steadiness in Guilt  When a Man thus wean'd from the World and all the Hopes of Life should be drawn forth from his dark and solitary Dungeon once more enjoy the open Air and see himself exposed to gazing Multitudes there met on purpose to feed their Curiosity at his Expence when the Paleness of his Countenance and the Shaking of every Limb should without Disguise reveal the Motions of his Heart and his Spirits neither confounded nor buoy'd up by inebriating Liquors should discover their real Condition and Incapacity to uphold their trembling Tenement the Spectacle would be awful and strike the  Hearts of the Beholders When seated on the ignominious Cart by his restless Posture the Distortion of his Features and the continual wringing of his Hands he should disclose his Woe within and the utmost depth of Sorrow When we should hear his shrill Cries and sad Complaints interrupted with bitter Sobs and anxious Groans and now and then at sudden Starts see Floods of Tears gushing from his distracted Eyes how thoroughly would the Concurrence of so many strong Evidences convince us of the Pangs the amazing Horror and unspeakable Agonies of his excruciated Soul  Common Stubbornness and Stupidity could not be Proof against all this and the Licentious Rabble of both Sexes that make now the most considerable part of those dismal Processions would not attend in such tumultuous Crowds Few Profligates would be able to stand the Shock of Sounds and Actions so really tragical Many would run away for fear of rouzing the Lion kept chain'd within and waking a guilty Conscience from the Lethargy they have thrown it in with so much Labour They would not follow long to behold a Scene so little to their Purpose and whatever Multitudes of them might set out with these Per  ents they would drop off and dwindle away by Degrees even the most obdurate would sicken at such a Sight and turning from it to less displeasing Objects seek  after more suitable Diversions The Absence of so many Rakehells that only take delight in Mischief would render these Tragedies more solemn and at the same Time make room for Spectators of a better Sort and lesser Sinners on whom in all Probability they would have a more desirable Effect It is not to be express'd what lasting and useful Impressions such Shews would make Many that are conscious of their Frailty and the small Power they have of conquering their Passions would take an Opportunity from them of adoring the divine Mercy for having preserved them hitherto from falling into such Crimes even the Voluptuous that in the Enjoyment of Youth and Vigour are enamour'd with Life for the sake of Pleasure would be startled at them and thank God that this was not their Case and several by the Fear of Death only become more serious and reflecting  Thus much we should gain at least in Behalf of Religion from every Execution even of the most sorry Felons who void of Sense and Goodness only grieve because they are to die and go they know not where But it is more than probable that some of them would become good Christians and make exemplary Ends When the Condemn'd should in every Respect receive the Treatment I have requir'd and by this Means undisturb'd by earthly Cares have Leisure in  sober Sadness to review their past Life and examine into the Multitude as well as Enormity of their Offences then after thorough Contrition and an open Confession in Behalf of Justice animated by Faith betake to constant Prayer we ought to believe that thus exerting themselves in the Work of Salvation by the good Guidance of able Divines and their own unwearied Endeavours many of them would find Favour in the Sight of the Almighty and that several even as they went to Death would be regenerated and comforted from above with a strong Assurance of Forgiveness What a visible Alteration would it not make in them when they should perceive their Spirits that the Moment before were overwhelm'd with Grief or fill'd with black Despair cherish'd and enlighten'd by the powerful Beams of heavenly Grace and Clemency Transported with the Prospect of approaching Bliss they then would wish to die and rejoice that they should be made Examples to frighten Evildoers from their Ways  But when they should consider what Acts of Devotion and unfeigned Piety what Works of superlative Charity would be necessary if they were to live to atone for the heinous Crimes and manifold Transgressions they had been guilty of against God and their Neighbour how would it rouze their Souls and how eager would it not render them in the  most profitable Manner to spend the small Remains of Life Sometimes they would deter the wicked and in the same Breath solicite Heaven for their Conversion At others reasoning from the Changes they had experienced within they would combat Impiety with Vehemence and conjure Unbelievers no longer to doubt of an everlasting Futurity They would paint to them in the strongest Colours the Horrors they had felt from an accusing Conscience and the Abyss of Misery they had been plunged in whilst yet labouring under the dire Reflection on eternal Vengeance And thus mixing fervent Prayers with strenuous Exhortation they would employ the few Moments that were left them in Exercises intirely spiritual and holy  How such Conversions would affect the Minds of all that saw or heard them cannot be better imagin'd than by examining our selves When we had seen an halfstarv'd Wretch that look'd like Death come shivering from his Prison and hardly able to speak or stand get with Difficulty on the slow uncomfortable Carriage where at the first Rumbling of it he should begin to weep and as he went dissolve in Tears and lose himself in incoherent Lamentations it would move us to Compassion But with what Astonishment would it not fill us to behold the same Creature near the fatal Tree become lively glow with Zeal and in Strength of Voice  and Action excell the most vigorous Preachers All this we might expect and that those of Wit and Genius as certainly there are among them would often light on new and convincing Arguments to warn the Sinner Nay some of them prove stupendious Orators that would not only spread Amazement all around them but likewise find uncommon Ways to reach the Heart with Violence and force Repentance on their Hearers It is Stupidity to doubt the vast Use such Executions would be of to compass Happiness both here and hereafter and should we regard the first only it would be no Exaggeration to assert that one of them would be more serviceable to the Peace and Security of this immense City than a thousand of those that are now so frequent among us  CHAP VI  Of  TRANSPORTATION  And a Method to render that Punishment more effectual  WHEN I concluded the last I thought not to have tired the Reader any longer with the Subject of Malefactors But it has been remonstated to me since that what I had wrote would seem very defective and this Treatise be in reality imperfect if I said nothing of Transportation which for some Years last past on many Occasions has been  substituted and inflicted in the room of capital Punishment and having at the same Time been furnish'd with a Hint concerning this Affair that may be of admirable Use I cannot forbear imparting it to the Publick There is no doubt but the Design of Transporting Felons instead of hanging them when their Crimes were not very enormous was just and commendable and it was reasonable to expect that it would have proved a powerful Remedy against the grand Evil I have all along complain'd of and which has been so often repeated But our subtle Criminals have found out Means hitherto to render it ineffectual Some have made their Escape in the Voyage itself others condemn'd to this Punishment never have been put on board several have reach'd the Plantations but been return'd again by the first Shipping and great Numbers have been come back before half their Time was expir'd Those that are forced to stay do very little Service themselves and spoil the other Slaves teaching the  Africans  more Villany and Mischief than ever they could have learn'd without the Examples and Instructions of such  Europeans  We have loud Complaints from all the Islands that we send such Numbers and they know not what to do with them As they come from  England  and are to serve  English  Men their Colour as well as Country and Language plead for them and the Masters that complain of  them are to blame themselves for treating them with less Severity than they do the innocent as well as unfortunate Blacks and more remisly than they ought if they consider'd that these Country Men of theirs are sent thither on purpose to work and are condemn'd to Hard Labour as a Punishment for their Crimes The mild Usage our Felons receive beyond Sea and the many Examples of such as come back before their Time with Impunity have quite destroy'd the End which Transportation was design'd for The Criminals have no dread against it remain as they were themselves and do no Service to others  To redress this there is an Expedient that may immediately be put into practice and is to my thinking every way unexceptionable for it would effectually prevent the returning of the Felons make them serviceable in the most extraordiary Manner and at the same Time be terrible beyond Expression The Use I would put them to is the Redemption of Slaves that in  Morocco  as well as  Tunis Algiers  and other Places on the Coast of  Barbary  groan under a miserable Servitude Should it be objected that such abandon'd People would turn Mahometans and our selves become accessary to their eternal Ruin I would ask what Surety we had for those that were there already Amongst our Seafaring Men the Practice of Piety is very scarce Abundance of them  lead very bad Lives who yet as to the Love of their Country and the  Meum Tuum  are very honest Fellows There are not many that are well grounded in the Principles of their Religion or would be capable of maintaining it against an Adversary of the least Ability and we are not certain that under great Temptations they would remain stedfast to the Christian Faith The Danger then of Apostacy being the same in both we must be manifestly the Gainers when we change lazy cowardly Thieves and incorrigible Rogues for brave laborious and useful People It would be no difficult Matter to enter into Negotiations with the several Powers of  Barbary  for this Purpose neither is it reasonable to imagine that they would scruple to take our Felons on account of the bad Lives they had led or refuse any for their Impudence Wickedness or Aversion to Labour They consider and manage their Slaves as we do our Cattle and it is their Age their Health the Soundness of their Limbs and their Strength they examine into with little Regard to their Temper or their Morals They are ever watchful over them without trusting to their Honesty or expecting any voluntary Obedience from them If bought Servants are able Masters there have sure Ways to make them work They laugh at Stubborness and refractory Spirits and their steady Severity is a sovereign Remedy against Sloth  and all other Failings of the Will From all which it is highly probable that a Barbarian would be glad to change an elderly honest Man pretty well worn and above Fifty for a sturdy Housebreaker of Five and twenty And as to those that might be pretty equal as to Years and Abilities what if we should give them three for two or two for one I am sure we could be no Losers Those likewise that are known to be in Quality superior to common Sailors might be redeem'd by still a greater Number of Felons or at the worst they could be no Sufferers by the Exchanges of the others  What I am speaking of I confess would be a very severe Punishment for Felony but I cannot imagine how we can think on the Rigour of it without reflecting at the same Time on the Inhumanity we are guilty of in the small Concern we often shew for many Years for the Captivity of those who have deserv'd no Punishment at all The greater the Calamities are of that cruel Bondage the more reasonable it is that the Guilty should suffer it rather than the Innocent It is unpardonable not to deliver from the Yoke of Infidels when it is in our Power our Fellow Subjects whom we have no Complaint against When sufficient Sums cannot be rais'd to redeem them with Money what should hinder us from doing it at the Expence of Miscreants whom it is Injustice  not to punish and who out of Chains cannot be otherwise than noxious to the Publick If this be duly weigh'd I doubt not but what at first seems to be the greatest Objection to this Proposal would on further Reflection be found an unanswerable Argument why we should embrace it There would likewise be room always with fresh Supplies of Felons to release those who might be cured or at least thought to have been sufficiently punish'd and to prevent all Tricks and Escapes this Service might be perform'd by Men of War instead of Merchant Men or Transports This effectual Manner of Transportation as Felons are treated and Things are managed now would be more dreadful than hanging whilst it was only talk'd of but when it came to the Push and Criminals came near and under the Gallows there would be very few if they were sober enough to think at all that before the Cart drove away would not change their Minds put off the evil Hour if they could and chuse Slavery or any Thing else to avoid immediate Death But then if the Regulations I have offer'd in the foregoing Chapter were likewise to be put in Practice the forc'd Abstinence and unavoidable Sobriety in Prison with the other Preparations before Detah and the Journey from  Newgate  to  Tyburn  without Hopes of Pardon or Reprieve would strike great Terror  even at a Distance by which Means the Thoughts of either would be insupportable and there would be no great Purchase in the Choice The Horror loose People would conceive against such Proceedings would be of inestimable Consequence to the Nation and Thousands that are yet unborn would deterr'd by the Rigour of those Laws turn their Hands to honest Labour and die in their Beds in their own Country that without them and Things remaining as they are will either be hanged or transported long before the End of this Century But if what I propose should not lessen the Number of Felons so much as ought to be expected it would clear us at least from the Blame of not having endeavour'd it and from Transportation we should have the Satisfaction that the Kingdom would not lose so many Inhabitants by it as it does now though the same Numbers were sent abroad But what is infinitely more valuable that Punishment likewise would rid without Slaughter or Probability of Return the Country of the Vermin of Society that perpetually nibbling at our Property destroy the Comforts of secure and undisturb'd Possession at the same Time that it would furnish us with an Opportunity of performing the most charitable Action in the World for such I will not scruple to call the redeeming and restoring to their Friends without their Cost industrious  Mariners that lost their Liberties and became Sufferers in an honest Calling and were led into dreadful Captivity by Infidels whilst in promoting the Interest of Commerce and Navigation they were labouring for the Safety the Wealth and Glory of their Country  I shall be told by some of my Readers that they are ready to contribute to the Redemption of unfortunate Captives with their Purses but that among Christians freeborn Subjects ought never to be made Slaves for any Reason or at any Rate whatever But this is a Singularity peculiar to  Englishmen  more built on an Excess of Goodnature than any sound Reason  France  and  Spain  make use of Malefactors in their Gallies and the  Hugonots  of the first would never have complained of that Punishment had it never been inflicted on any but Thieves and Villains But these are  Roman  Catholick Countries and arbitrary Kingdoms Of  Holland  you can say neither and yet the great Cities of it have all Workhouses for Criminals At  Amsterdam  there is one where Felons are kept constantly employ'd in rasping of  Brasil  Wood To earn at this as much as they spend is not to be done without excessive Labour though they fare as hard as they work yet they are obliged to get more than their Maintenance costs considerably They have a Task set them which if they do not perform  the Neglect of their Hands is reveng'd on their Bellies and they are stinted in their Allowance in Proportion to the Deficiency In this Place a very strict Hand is kept over them no Offences are left unpunished and they are often drubb'd even for ill Language The Periods of Time for which Felons are condemned to this Rasphouse are vastly different according as their great Crimes or slighter Trespasses deserve this Tuition and themselves are young or old Offenders and judged to be more or less incorrigible from six Weeks to ninety nine Years These are not called Slaves but such is their Abode their Diet and their Discipline that of those who were to be confined there for any considerable Number of Years I don't believe there ever was one who would not have thought it a glorious Preferment if instead of it he might have taken his Chance and been sold for a Slave in  Turky  We have I own no open Enemies in  Africk  more than any where else at present and our most gracious Sovereign has by his Clemency and powerful Influence over the Emperor of  Morocco  procured Liberty to those of his Subjects that had been taken in  English  Ships But it is wrong from thence to infer that there are no Slaves in  Turky  of the  British  Nation  Among those that are brought up to the Sea there are many that by several Accidents  are left ashore in Foreign Parts and are necessitated to enter themselves on any Ships they can meet with If this be done in Time of Peace and when they are not summoned to serve their own Country they are guilty of no Fault But as all Mariners as well as Soldiers share the Fate of those on whose Side they engage so many of our Sailors are Slaves in  Turky  that were taken in  French Dutch  and other Ships and are consequently not reclaimable by any Treaty made with  Great Britain  Tho' these might not deserve the same Regard altogether with those that were taken in Ships of the  British  Nation yet as they are our Countrymen and have committed no Crime their Redemption ought not to be deferred one Moment if they might be had in Exchange for others whom we have judged not worthy to live amongst us Besides as we are at Peace now with all those Rovers so half a Year hence some or other of them may fall out with us their Friendship is not much to be depended upon Let the Provision but be made and Felons kept at hard Labour and under strict Discipline at home till they are wanted abroad and we shall find that the Institution it self the very Name of it will be of vast Use before the Thing itself is put into Practice  FINIS
