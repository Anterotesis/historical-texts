MERCURY  and the  ELEPHANT  A Prefatory FABLE  AS Merc'ry  travell'd thro' a Wood  Whose Errands are more Fleet than Good  An  Elephant  before him lay  That much encumber'd had the Way  The Messenger who's still in haste  Wou'd fain have bow'd and so have past  When up arose th' unweildy Brute  And wou'd repeat a late Dispute  In which he said he'd gain'd the Prize  From a wild Boar of monstrous Size  But Fame quoth he with all her Tongues  Who Lawyers Ladies Soldiers wrongs  Has to my Disadvantage told  An Action throughly Bright and Bold  Has said that I foul Play had us'd  And with my Weight th' Opposer bruis'd  Had laid my Trunk about his Brawn  Before his Tushes cou'd be drawn  Had stunn'd him with a hideous Roar  And twentythousand Scandals more  But I defy the Talk of Men  Or Voice of Brutes in ev'ry Den  Th' impartial Skies are all my Care  And how it stands Recorded there  Amongst you Gods pray What is thought  Quoth  Mercury  Then have you Fought  Solicitous thus shou'd I be  For what's said of my Verse and Me  Or shou'd my Friends Excuses frame  And beg the Criticks not to blame  Since from a Female Hand it came  Defects in Judgment or in Wit  They'd but replyThen has she Writ  Our Vanity we more betray  In asking what the World will say  Than if in trivial Things like these  We wait on the Event with ease  Nor make long  Prefaces  to show  What Men are not concern'd to know  For still untouch'd how we succeed  'Tis for themselves not us they  Read  Whilst that proceeding to requite  We own who in the Muse delight  'Tis for our Selves not them we  Write  Betray'd by Solitude to try  Amusements which the Prosp'rous fly  And only to the Press repair  To six our scatter'd Papers there  Tho' whilst our Labours are preserv'd  The Printers may indeed be starv'd  All is Vanity  I  HOW vain is  Life  which rightly we compare  To flying  Posts  that haste away  To  Plants  that fade with the declining Day  To  Clouds  that sail amidst the yielding Air  Till by Extention into that they flow  Or scatt'ring on the World below  Are lost and gone ere we can say they were  To  AutumnLeaves  which every Wind can chace  To rising  Bubbles  on the Waters Face  To fleeting  Dreams  that will not stay  Nor in th' abused Fancy dance  When the returning Rays of Light  Resuming their alternate Right  Break on th' illorder'd Scene on the fantastick Trance  As weak is  Man  whilst Tenant to the Earth  As frail and as uncertain all his Ways  From the first moment of his weeping Birth  Down to the last and best of his few restless Days  When to the Land of Darkness he retires  From disappointed Hopes and frustrated Desires  Reaping no other Fruit of all his Pain  Bestow'd whilst in the vale of Tears below  But this unhappy Truth at last to know  That Vanity's our Lot and all Mankind is Vain  II  If past the hazard of his tendrest Years  Neither in thoughtless Sleep opprest  Nor poison'd with a tainted Breast  Loos'd from the infant Bands and female Cares  A  studious Boy  advanc'd beyond his Age  Wastes the dim Lamp and turns the restless Page  For some lov'd Book prevents the rising Day  And on it stoln aside bestows the Hours of Play  Him the observing Master do's design  For search of darkned Truths and Mysteries Divine  Bids him with unremitted Labour trace  The Rise of Empires and their various Fates  The several Tyrants o'er the several States  To  Babel  's lofty Towers and warlike  Nimrod  's Race  Bids him in Paradice the Bank survey  Where Man newmoulded from the temper'd Clay  Till fir'd with Breath Divine a helpless Figure lay  Could he be led thus farWhat were the Boast  What the Reward of all the Toil it cost  What from that Land of everblooming Spring  For our Instruction could he bring  Unless that having Humane Nature found  Unseparated from its Parent Ground  Howe'er we vaunt our Elevated Birth  The Epicure in soft Array  The lothsome Beggar that before  His rude unhospitable Door  Unpity'd but by Brutes a broken Carcass lay  Were both alike deriv'd from the same common Earth  But ere the Child can to these Heights attain  Ere he can in the Learned Sphere arise  A guiding Star attracting to the Skies  A Fever seizing the o'erlabour'd Brain  Sends him perhaps to Death's concealing Shade  Where in the Marble Tomb now silent laid  He better do's that useful Doctrine show  Which all the sad Assistants ought to know  Who round the Grave his short continuance mourn  That first from Dust we came and must to Dust return  III  A  bolder Youth  grown capable of Arms  Bellona  courts with her prevailing Charms  Bids th' inchanting Trumpet sound  Loud as Triumph soft as Love  Striking now the Poles above  'Then descending from the Skies  Soften every falling Note  As the harmonious  Lark  that sings and flies  When near the Earth contracts her narrow Throat  And warbles on the Ground  Shews the proud Steed impatient of the Check  'Gainst the loudest Terrors Proof  Pawing the Valley with his steeled Hoof  With Lightning arm'd his Eyes with Thunder cloth'd his Neck  Who on th' advanced Foe the Signal giv'n  Flies like a rushing Storm by mighty Whirlwinds driv'n  Lays open the Records of Fame  No glorious Deed omits no Man of mighty Name  Their Stratagems their Tempers she'll repeat  From  Alexander  's truly stil'd the GREAT  From  Caesar  's on the World's Imperial Seat  To  Turenne  's Conduct and to  Conde  's Heat  'Tis done and now th' ambitious Youth disdains  The safe but harder Labours of the Gown  The softer Pleasures of the Courtly Town  The once lov'd rural Sports and Chaces on the Plains  Does with the Soldier's Life the Garb assume  The gold Embroid'ries and the graceful Plume  Walks haughty in a Coat of Scarlet Die  A Colour well contriv'd to cheat the Eye  Where richer Blood alas may undistinguisht lye  And oh too near that wretched Fate attends  Hear it ye Parents all ye weeping Friends  Thou fonder Maid won by those gaudy Charms  The destin'd Prize of his Victorious Arms  Now sainting Dye upon the mournful Sound  That speaks his hasty Death and paints the fatal Wound  Trail all your Pikes dispirit every Drum  March in a slow Procession from afar  Ye silent ye dejected Men of War  Be still the Hautboys and the Flute be dumb  Display no more in vain the lofty Banner  For see where on the Bier before ye lies  The pale the fall'n th' untimely Sacrifice  To your mistaken Shrine to your false Idol Honour  IV  As Vain is  Beauty  and as short her Power  Tho' in its proud and transitory Sway  The coldest Hearts and wisest Heads obey  That gay fantastick Tyrant of an Hour  On  Beauty's  Charms altho' a Father's Right  Tho' grave  Seleucus  to thy Royal Side  By holy Vows fair  Stratonice  be ty'd  With anxious Joy with dangerous Delight  Too often gazes thy unwary Son  Till past all Hopes expiring and undone  A speaking Pulse the secret Cause impart  The only time when the Physician's Art  Could ease that lab'ring Grief or heal a Lover's Smart  See Great  Antonius  now impatient stand  Expecting with mistaken Pride  On  Cydnus  crowded Shore on  Cydnus  fatal Strand  A  Cleopatra  's coming down the  Cydnus  exactly agreeing with the Description of it in  Plutarch  Queen  at his Tribunal to be try'd  A  Queen  that arm'd in Beauty shall deride  His feeble Rage and his whole Fate command  O'er the still Waves her burnisht Galley moves  Row'd by the Graces whilst officious Loves  To silken Cords their busie Hands apply  Or gathering all the gentle Gales that fly  To their fair Mistress with those Spoils repair  And from their purple Wings disperse the balmy Air  Hov'ring Perfumes ascend in od'rous Clouds  Curl o'er the Barque and play among the Shrouds  Whilst gently dashing every Silver Oar  Guided by the Rules of Art  With tuneful Instruments design'd  To soften and subdue the stubborn Mind  A strangely pleasing and harmonious Part  In equal Measures bore  Like a new  Venus  on her native Sea  In midst of the transporting Scene  Which Pen or Pencil imitates in vain  On a resplendent and conspicuous Bed  With all the Pride of  Persia  loosely spread  The lovely  Syrene  lay  Which but discern'd from the yet distant Shore  Th' amazed Emperor could hate no more  No more a baffled Vengeance could pursue  But yielding still still as she nearer drew  When  Cleopatra  anchor'd in the Bay  Where every Charm cou'd all its Force display  Like his own  Statue  stood and gaz'd the  World  away  Where ends alas this Pageantry and State  Where end the Triumphs of this conqu'ring Face  Envy'd of  Roman  Wives and all the Female Race  Oh swift Vicissitude of Beauty's Fate  Now in her Tomb withdrawn from publick Sight  From near Captivity and Shame  The vanquish'd the abandon'd Dame  Proffers the Arm that held another's Right  To the destructive Snake's more just Embrace  And courts deforming  Death  to mend his Leaden Pace  V  But  Wit  shall last the vaunting  Poet  cries  Th' immortal Streams that from  Parnassus  flow  Shall make his neverfading Lawrels grow  Above this mouldring Earth to flourish in the Skies  " And  The two Lines with these Marks " before them are thus Translated by  Ben Johnson  from  Ovid  when his Body falls in Funeral Fire  When late revolving Ages shall consume  The very Pillars that support his Tomb  " His Name shall live and his best Part aspire  Deluded Wretch grasping at future Praise  Now planting with mistaken Care  Round thy enchanted Palace in the Air  A Grove which in thy Fancy time shall raise  A Grove of soaring Palms and everlasting Bays  Could'st Thou alas to such Renown arrive  As thy Imaginations wou'd contrive  Should numerous Cities in a vain contest  Struggle for thy famous Birth  Should the sole Monarch of the conquer'd Earth  His wreathed Head upon thy Volume rest  Like  Maro  could'st thou justly claim  Amongst th' inspired tuneful Race  The highest Room the undisputed Place  And after near Two Thousand Years of Fame  Have thy proud Work to a new People shown  Th' unequal'd Poems made their own  In such a Dress in such a perfect Stile  As on his Labours  Dryden  now bestows  As now from  Dryden  's just Improvement flows  In every polish'd Verse throughout the  British  Isle  What Benefit alas would to thee grow  What Sense of Pleasure wou'dst thou know  What swelling Joy what Pride what Glory have  When in the Darkness of the abject Grave  Insensible and  Stupid  laid below  No Atom of thy Heap no Dust wou'd move  For all the airy Breath that form'd thy Praise above  VI  True says the Man to  Luxury  inclin'd  Without the Study of uncertain Art  Without much Labour of the Mind  Meer uninstructed Nature will impart  That Life too swiftly flies and leaves all good behind  Sieze then my Friends he cries the present Hour  The Pleasure which to that belongs  The Feasts th' o'erflowing Bowls the Mirth the Songs  The OrangeBloom that with such Sweetness blows  Anacreon  's celebrated Rose  The Hyacinth with every beauteous Flower  Which just this happy Moment shall disclose  Are out of Fortune's reach and all within our Power  Such costly  In the Life of  Demetrius  in  Plutarch  there is a Description of a Garment order'd to be made for him wherein was express'd in precious Stones and other costly Materials the Elements as here describ'd  Garments let our Slaves prepare  As for the gay  Demetrius  were design'd  Where a new Sun of radiant Diamonds shin'd  Where the enamel'd Earth and scarcediscerned Air  With a transparent Sea were seen  A Sea composed of the Em'rald's Green  And with a golden Shore encompass'd round  Where every Orient Shell of wondrous shape was found  The whole Creation on his Shoulders hung  The whole Creation with his Wish comply'd  Did swiftly for each Appetite provide  And fed them all when Young  No less th'  Sardanapalus  Assyrian  Prince enjoy'd  Of Bliss too soon depriv'd but never cloy'd  Whose Counsel let us still pursue  Whose Monument did this Inscription shew  To every Passenger that trod the way  Where with a slighting  In  Sardanapalus  's Statue upon his Monument as described by several Authors and upon Medals his right Hand is held up with his Fingers in a Posture as giving a  Filip  to the World  Hand and scornful Smile  The proud Essigies on th' instructive Pile  A great Example lay  I here Entomb'd did mighty Kingdoms sway  Two Cities rais'd  Anchialus  and  Tarsus  in one prodigious Day  Thou wand'ring Traveller no longer gaze  No longer dwell upon this useless Place  Go Feed and Drink in Sports consume thy Life  For All that else we gain's not worth a Moment's Strife  Thus talks the Fool whom no Restraint can bound  When now the Glass has gone a frequent round  When soaring Fancy lightly swims  Fancy that keeps above and dances o'er the Brims  Whilst weighty Reason sinks and in the bottom's drown'd  Adds to his Own an artificial Fire  Doubling ev'ry hot Desire  Till th' auxiliary Spirits in a Flame  The Stomach's Magazine defy  That standing Pool that helpless Moisture nigh  Thro' every Vital part impetuous fly  And quite consume the Frame  When to the Under world despis'd he goes  A pamper'd Carcase on the Worms bestows  Who rioting on the unusual Chear  As good a Life enjoy as he could boast of here  VII  But hold my Muse thy farther Flight restrain  Exhaust not thy declining Force  Nor in a long pursu'd and breathless Course  Attempt with slacken'd speed to run  Through ev'ry Vanity beneath the Sun  Lest thy o'erweary'd Reader should complain  That of all Vanities beside  Which thine or his Experience e'er have try'd  Thou art too tedious Muse most frivolous and vain  Yet tell the Man of an aspiring Thought  Of an ambitious restless Mind  That can no Ease no Satisfaction find  Till neighb'ring States are to Subjection brought  Till Universal Awe enslav'd Mankind is taught  That should he lead an Army to the Field  For whose still necessary Use  Th' extended Earth cou'd not enough produce  Nor Rivers to their Thirst a full Contentment yield  Yet must their dark Reverse of Fate  Roll round within that Course of Years  Within the short the swift and fleeting Date  Prescrib'd by  Xerxes  Xerxes  reviewing his most numerous Army wept upon the Reflection that within Years not One of them would be left Alive  when his falling Tears  Bewail'd those Numbers which his Sword employ'd  And false  Hyena  like lamented and destroy'd  Tell Him that does some stately Building raise  A  Windsor  or  Versailles  erect  And thorough all Posterity expect  With its unshaken Base a firm unshaken Praise  Tell Him  Judea  's Temple is no more  Upon whose Splendour Thousands heretofore  Spent the astonish'd Hours forgetful to Adore  Tell him into the Earth agen is hurl'd  That most stupendious Wonder of the World  Justly presiding o'er the boasted Seven  By humane Art and Industry design'd  This the rich Draught of the Immortal Mind  The Architect of Heaven  Remember then to fix thy Aim on High  Project and build on t'other side the Sky  For after all thy vain Expence below  Thou canst no Fame no lasting Pleasure know  No Good that shall not thy Embraces fly  Or thou from that be in a Moment caught  Thy Spirit to new Claims new Int'rests brought  Whilst unconcern'd thy secret Ashes lye  Or stray about the Globe  O Man ordain'd to Dye  The Prevalence of Custom  A Female to a Drunkard marry'd  When all her other Arts miscarry'd  Had yet one Stratagem to prove him  And from good Fellowship remove him  Finding him overcome with Tipple  And weak as Infant at the Nipple  She to a Vault transports the Lumber  And  there expects  his breaking Slumber  A Table she with Meat provided  And rob'd in Black stood just beside it  Seen only by one glim'ring Taper  That blewly burnt thro' misty Vapor  At length he wakes his Wine digested  And of her Phantomship requested  To learn the Name of that close Dwelling  And what offends his Sight and Smelling  And of what Land she was the Creature  With outspread Hair and ghastly Feature  Mortal quoth she to Darkness hurry'd  Know that thou art both Dead and Bury'd  Convey'd last Night from noisie Tavern  To this thy still and dreary Cavern  What strikes thy Nose springs from the Shatters  Of Bodies kill'd with Cordial Waters  Stronger than other Scents and quicker  As urg'd by more spirituous Liquor  My self attend on the Deceas'd  When all their Earthly Train's releas'd  And in this Place of endless Quiet  My Bus'ness is to find them Diet  To shew all sorts of Meats and Salades  Till I'm acquainted with their Palates  But that once known then less suffices  Quoth he and on his Crupper rises  Thou Guardian of these lower Regions  Thou Providor for countless Legions  Thou dark but charitable Crony  Far kinder than my  Tisiphony  Who of our Victuals thus art Thinking  If thou hast Care too of our Drinking  A  Bumper  fetch Quoth she a  Halter  Since nothing less thy Tone can alter  Or break this Habit thou'st been getting  To keep thy Throat in constant wetting  THE Mussulman's Dream OF THE  VIZIER  and  DERVIS  WHere is that World to which the Fancy flies  When Sleep excludes the Present from our Eyes  Whose Map no Voyager cou'd e'er design  Nor to Description its wild Parts confine  Yet such a Land of Dreams We must allow  Who nightly trace it tho' we know not how  Unfetter'd by the Days obtruded Rules  We All enjoy that Paradise of Fools  And find a Sorrow in resuming Sense  Which breaks some free Delight and snatches us from thence  Thus in a Dream a  Mussulman  was shown  A  Vizir  whom he formerly had known  When at the  Port  he bore deputed Sway  And made the Nations with a Nod obey  Now all serene and splendid was his Brow  Whilst ready Waiters to his Orders bow  His Residence an artful Garden seem'd  Adorn'd with all that pleasant he esteem'd  Full of Reward his glorious Lot appear'd  As with the Sight our Dreamer's Mind was chear'd  But turning next he saw a dreadful Sight  Which fill'd his Soul with Wonder and Affright  Pursu'd by Friends a wretched  Dervis  sled  Through scorching Plains which to wide Distance spread  Whilst every Torture gloomy Poets paint  Was there prepar'd for the reputed Saint  Amaz'd at this the sleeping  Turk  enquires  Why He that liv'd above in soft Attires  Now roll'd in Bliss while t'other roll'd in Fires  We're taught the Suff'rings of this Future State  Th' Excess of Courts is likeliest to create  Whilst solitary Cells o'ergrown with Shade  The readiest way to Paradise is made  True quoth the Phantom which he dream'd reply'd  The lonely Path is still the surest Guide  Nor is it by these Instances deny'd  For know my Friend whatever Fame report  The  Vizier  to Retirements wou'd resort  Th'ambitious  Dervis  wou'd frequent the Court  The Shepherd Piping to the Fishes  Shepherd seeking with his Lass  To shun the Heat of Day  Was seated on the shadow'd Grass  Near which a flowing Stream did pass  And Fish within it play  To  Phillis  he an Angle gave  And bid her toss the Line  For sure quoth he each Fish must have  Who do's not seek to be thy Slave  A harder Heart than mine  Assemble here you watry Race  Transportedly he cries  And if when you behold her Face  You e'er desire to quit the Place  You see not with my Eyes  But you perhaps are by the Ear  More easie to be caught  If so I have my Bagpipe here  The only Musick that's not dear  Nor in great Cities bought  So sprightly was the Tune he chose  And often did repeat  That  Phillis  tho' not up she rose  Kept time with every thrilling Close  And jigg'd upon her Seat  But not a Fish wou'd nearer draw  No Harmony or Charms  Their frozen Blood it seems cou'd thaw  Nor all they heard nor all they saw  Cou'd woo them to such Terms  The angry Shepherd in a Pett  Gives o'er his wheedling Arts  And from his Shoulder throws the Net  Resolv'd he wou'd a Supper get  By Force if not by Parts  Thus stated Laws are always best  To rule the vulgar Throng  Who grow more Stubborn when Carest  Or with soft Rhetorick addrest  If taking Measures wrong  Love Death and Reputation  REputation Love  and  Death  The Last all Bones the First all Breath  The Midd'st compos'd of restless Fire  From each other wou'd Retire  Thro' the World resolv'd to stray  Every One a several Way  Exercising as they went  Each such Power as Fate had lent  Which if it united were  Wretched Mortals cou'd not bear  But as parting Friends do show  To what Place they mean to go  Correspondence to engage  Nominate their utmost Stage  Death  declar'd he wou'd be found  Near the fatal Trumpet's sound  Or where Pestilences reign  And Quacks the greater Plagues maintain  Shaking still his sandy Glass  And mowing Human Flesh like Grass  Love  as next his Leave he took  Cast on both so sweet a Look  As their Tempers near disarm'd  One relax'd and t'other warm'd  Shades for his Retreat he chose  Rural Plains and soft Repose  Where no Dowry e'er was paid  Where no Jointure e'er was made  No Ill Tongue the Nymph perplex'd  Where no Forms the Shepherd vex'd  Where Himself shou'd be the Care  Of the Fond and of the Fair  Where that was they soon shou'd know  Au Revoir  then turn'd to Go  Reputation  made a Pause  Suiting her severer Laws  Second Thoughts and Third she us'd  Weighing Consequences mus'd  When at length to both she cry'd  You  Two  safely may Divide  To th'  Antipodes  may fall  And reascend th' encompast Ball  Certain still to meet agen  In the Breasts of tortur'd Men  Who by One too far betray'd  Call in t'other to their Aid  Whilst I Tender Coy and Nice  Rais'd and ruin'd in a Trice  Either six with those I grace  Or abandoning the Place  No Return my Nature bears  From green Youth or hoary Hairs  If thro' Guilt or Chance I sever  I once Parting Part for ever  There's No ToMorrow  A  FABLE  imitated from Sir  Roger L'Estrange  TWO long had Lov'd and now the Nymph desir'd  The Cloak of Wedlock as the Case requir'd  Urg'd that the Day he wrought her to this Sorrow  He Vow'd that he wou'd marry her  ToMorrow  Agen he Swears to shun the present Storm  That he  ToMorrow  will that Vow perform  The  Morrows  in their due Successions came  Impatient still on Each the pregnant Dame  Urg'd him to keep his Word and still he swore the same  When tir'd at length and meaning no Redress  But yet the Lye not caring to confess  He for his Oath this Salvo chose to borrow  That he was Free since there was no  ToMorrow  For when it comes in Place to be employ'd  'Tis then  ToDay ToMorrow  's ne'er enjoy'd  The Tale's a Jest the Moral is a Truth  ToMorrow  and  ToMorrow  cheat our Youth  In riper Age  ToMorrow  still we cry  Not thinking that the present Day we Dye  Ʋnpractis'd all the Good we had Design'd  There's No  ToMorrow  to a Willing Mind  The Petition for an Absolute Retreat  Inscribed to the Right Hon  ble  CATHARINE  Countess of  THANET  mention  d in the Poem under the Name of  ARMINDA  GIVE me O indulgent Fate  Give me yet before I Dye  A sweet but absolute Retreat  'Mongst Paths so lost and Trees so high  That the World may ne'er invade  Through such Windings and such Shade  My unshaken Liberty  No Intruders thither come  Who visit but to be from home  None who their vain Moments pass  Only studious of their Glass  News that charm to listning Ears  That false Alarm to Hopes and Fears  That common Theme for every Fop  From the Statesman to the Shop  In those Coverts ne'er be spread  Of who's Deceas'd or who's to Wed  Be no Tidings thither brought  But Silent as a Midnight Thought  Where the World may ne'er invade  Be those Windings and that Shade  Courteous Fate afford me there  A  Table  spread without my Care  With what the neighb'ring Fields impart  Whose Cleanliness be all it's Art  When of old the Calf was drest  Tho' to make an Angel's Feast  In the plain unstudied Sauce  Nor  Treufle  nor  Morillia  was  Nor cou'd the mighty Patriarch's Board  One farfetch'd  Ortolane  afford  Courteous Fate then give me there  Only plain and wholesome Fare  Fruits indeed wou'd Heaven bestow  All that did in  Eden  grow  All but the  Forbidden Tree  Wou'd be coveted by me  Grapes with Juice so crouded up  As breaking thro' the native Cup  Figs yet growing candy'd o'er  By the Sun's attracting Pow'r  Cherries with the downy Peach  All within my easie Reach  Whilst creeping near the humble Ground  Shou'd the Strawberry be found  Springing wheresoe'er I stray'd  Thro' those Windings and that Shade  For my  Garments  let them be  What may with the Time agree  Warm when  Phoebus  does retire  And is illsupply'd by Fire  But when he renews the Year  And verdant all the Fields appear  Beauty every thing resumes  Birds have dropt their WinterPlumes  When the Lilly full display'd  Stands in purer White array'd  Than that Vest which heretofore  The Luxurious  Josephus  says that every  Monday Solomon  went to the House of  Lebanon  in an open Chariot cloath'd in a Robe most dazling White which makes that Allusion not improper and may give us Grounds to believe that the  Lilly  mention'd by our Saviour compar'd to  Solomon  in his Glory might really be the common white  Lilly  altho' the Commentators seem in doubt what Flowers are truly meant by the  Lillies  as thinking the plain  Lilly  not gay enough for the Comparison whereas this Garment is noted by  Josephus  to be wonderfully Beautiful tho' only White nor can any Flower I believe have a greater Lustre than the common White  Lilly  Monarch wore  When from  Salem  's Gates he drove  To the soft Retreat of Love  Lebanon  's all burnish'd House  And the dear  Egyptian  Spouse  Cloath me Fate tho' not so Gay  Cloath me light and fresh as  May  In the Fountains let me view  All my Habit cheap and new  Such as when sweet  Zephyrs  fly  With their Motions may comply  Gently waving to express  Unaffected Carelesness  No Perfumes have there a Part  Borrow'd from the  Chymists  Art  But such as rise from flow'ry Beds  Or the falling  Jasmin  Sheds  'Twas the Odour of the Field  Esau  's rural Coat did yield  That inspir'd his Father's Pray'r  For Blessings of the Earth and Air  Of Gums or Pouders had it smelt  The Supplanter then unfelt  Easily had been descry'd  For One that did in Tents abide  For some beauteous Handmaids Joy  And his Mother's darling Boy  Let me then no Fragrance wear  But what the Winds from Gardens bear  In such kind surprizing Gales  As gather'd from  These Circumstances are related by  Plutarch  in the Life of  Sylla  Fidentia  's Vales  All the Flowers that in them grew  Which intermixing as they flew  In wreathen Garlands dropt agen  On  Lucullus  and his Men  Who chear'd by the victorious Sight  Trebl'd Numbers put to Flight  Let me when I must be fine  In such natural Colours shine  Wove and painted by the Sun  Whose resplendent Rays to shun  When they do too fiercely beat  Let me find some close Retreat  Where they have no Passage made  Thro' those Windings and that Shade  Give me there since Heaven has shown  It was not Good to be alone  A Partner  suited to my Mind  Solitary pleas'd and kind  Who partially may something see  Preferr'd to all the World in me  Slighting by my humble Side  Fame and Splendor Wealth and Pride  When but Two the Earth possest  'Twas their happiest Days and best  They by Bus'ness nor by Wars  They by no Domestick Cares  From each other e'er were drawn  But in some Grove or flow'ry Lawn  Spent the swiftly flying Time  Spent their own and Nature's Prime  In Love that only Passion given  To perfect Man whilst Friends with Heaven  Rage and Jealousie and Hate  Transports of his fallen State  When by  Satan  's Wiles betray'd  Fly those Windings and that Shade  Thus from Crouds and Noise remov'd  Let each Moment be improv'd  Every Object still produce  Thoughts of Pleasure and of Use  When some River slides away  To encrease the boundless Sea  Think we then how Time do's haste  To grow Eternity at last  By the Willows on the Banks  Gather'd into social Ranks  Playing with the gentle Winds  Strait the Boughs and smooth the Rinds  Moist each Fibre and each Top  Wearing a luxurious Crop  Let the time of Youth be shown  The time alas too soon outgrown  Whilst a lonely stubborn Oak  Which no Breezes can provoke  No less Gusts persuade to move  Than those which in a Whirlwind drove  Spoil'd the old Fraternal Feast  And left alive but one poor Guest  Rivell'd the distorted Trunk  Sapless Limbs all bent and shrunk  Sadly does the Time presage  Of our too near approaching Age  When a helpless Vine is found  Unsupported on the Ground  Careless all the Branches spread  Subject to each haughty Tread  Bearing neither Leaves nor Fruit  Living only in the Root  Back reflecting let me say  So the sad  Ardelia  lay  Blasted by a Storm of Fate  Felt thro' all the  British  State  Fall'n neglected lost forgot  Dark Oblivion all her Lot  Faded till  Arminda  's Love  Guided by the Pow'rs above  Warm'd anew her drooping Heart  And Life diffus'd thro' every Part  Mixing Words in wise Discourse  Of such Weight and wond'rous Force  As could all her Sorrows charm  And transitory Ills disarm  Chearing the delightful Day  When dispos'd to be more Gay  With Wit from an unmeasured Store  To Woman ne'er allow'd before  What Nature or refining Art  All that Fortune cou'd impart  Heaven did to  Arminda  send  Then gave her for  Ardelia  's Friend  To her Cares the Cordial drop  Which else had overflow'd the Cup  So when once the Son of  Jess  Every Anguish did oppress  Hunted by all kinds of Ills  Like a  Partridge  on the Hills  Trains were laid to catch his Life  Baited with a Royal Wife  From his House and Country torn  Made a Heathen Prince's Scorn  Fate to answer all these Harms  Threw a  Friend  into his Arms  Friendship  still has been design'd  The Support of Humankind  The safe Delight the useful Bliss  The next World's Happiness and this  Give then O indulgent Fate  Give a Friend in that Retreat  Tho' withdrawn from all the rest  Still a Clue to reach my Breast  Let a Friend be still convey'd  Thro' those Windings and that Shade  Where may I remain secure  Waste in humble Joys and pure  A Life that can no Envy yield  Want of Affluence my Shield  Thus had  The Description of this Cave is exactly taken from  Plutarch  in the Life of  Crassus  Crassus  been content  When from  Marius  Rage he went  With the Seat that Fortune gave  The commodious ample Cave  Form'd in a divided Rock  By some mighty Earthquake's Shock  Into Rooms of every Size  Fair as Art cou'd e'er devise  Leaving in the marble Roof  'Gainst all Storms and Tempests proof  Only Passage for the Light  To refresh the chearful Sight  Whilst Three Sharers in his Fate  On th' Escape with Joy dilate  Beds of Moss their Bodies bore  Canopy'd with Ivy o'er  Rising Springs that round them play'd  O'er the native Pavement stray'd  When the Hour arriv'd to Dine  Various Meats and sprightly Wine  On some neighb'ring Cliff they spy'd  Every Day anew supply'd  By a Friend's entrusted Care  Had He still continu'd there  Made that lonely wond'rous Cave  Both his Palace and his Grave  Peace and Rest he might have found  Peace and Rest are under Ground  Nor have been in that Retreat  Fam'd for a Proverbial Fate  In pursuit of Wealth been caught  And punish'd with a golden Draught  Nor had  Sertorius  He who Crowds cou'd blind  Whisp'ring with a snowy Hind  Made 'em think that from above  Like the great Impostor's Dove  Tydings to his Ears she brought  Rules by which he march'd and fought  After  Spain  he had o'errun  Cities sack'd and Battles won  Drove  Rome  's Consuls from the Field  Made her darling  Pompey  yield  At a fatal treacherous Feast  Felt a Dagger in his Breast  Had he his oncepleasing Thought  Of Solitude to Practice brought  Had no wild Ambition sway'd  In those Islands had he stay'd  Justly call'd the Seats of Rest  Truly  The  Canary  Islands call'd by the Ancients the  Fortunate  Islands and taken by some of the Poets for  Elysium  Fortunate and Blest  By the ancient Poets giv'n  As their best discover'd Heav'n  Let me then indulgent Fate  Let me still in my Retreat  From all roving Thoughts be freed  Or Aims that may Contention breed  Nor be my Endeavours led  By Goods that perish with the Dead  Fitly might the Life of Man  Be indeed esteem'd a Span  If the present Moment were  Of Delight his only Share  If no other Joys he knew  Than what round about him grew  But as those who Stars wou'd trace  From a subterranean Place  Through some Engine lift their Eyes  To the outward glorious Skies  So th' immortal Spirit may  When descended to our Clay  From a rightly govern'd Frame  View the Height from whence she came  To her Paradise be caught  And Things unutterable taught  Give me then in that Retreat  Give me O indulgent Fate  For all Pleasures left behind  Contemplations of the Mind  Let the Fair the Gay the Vain  Courtship and Applause obtain  Let th' Ambitious rule the Earth  Let the giddy Fool have Mirth  Give the Epicure his Dish  Ev'ry one their sev'ral Wish  Whilst my Transports I employ  On that more extensive Joy  When all Heaven shall be survey'd  From those Windings and that Shade  Jupiter  and the  Farmer  WHen Poets gave their God in  Crete  a Birth  Then  Jupiter  held Traffick with the Earth  And had a Farm to Lett the Fine was high  For much the Treas'ry wanted a Supply  By  Danaë  's wealthy Show'r exhausted quite and dry  But  Merc'ry  who as Steward kept the Court  So rack'd the Rent that all who made Resort  Unsatisfy'd return'd nor could agree  To use the Lands or pay his secret Fee  'Till one poor Clown thought subt'ler than the rest  Thro' various Projects rolling in his Breast  Consents to take it if at his Desire  All Weathers tow'rds his Harvest may conspire  The Frost to kill the Worm the brooding Snow  The filling Rains may come and  Phoebus  glow  The Terms accepted sign'd and seal'd the Lease  His Neighbours Grounds afford their due Encrease  The Care of Heav'n the Owner's

Darling of this Lady  Chance  Whilst I indeed not courting of her Grace  Shall dwell content in this my Native Place  Hoping I still shall for your Friend be known  But if too big for such Acquaintance grown  I shan't be such a fond mistaken Sot  To think Remembrance shou'd become my Lot  When you Exalted have your self Forgot  Nor me Ambitious ever shall you find  Or hunting Fortune

Shuttle  scorn'd  Arachne  then with  Pallas  did contest  And scarce th' Immortal Work was judg'd the Best  Nor valorous Actions then in Books were sought  But all the Fame that from the Field was brought  Employ'd the  Loom  where the kind  Consort  wrought  Whilst sharing in the Toil she shar'd the Fame  And with the  Heroes  mixt her interwoven Name  No longer  Females  to such Praise aspire  And seldom now We rightly do admire  So much All Arts are by the  Men  engross'd  And Our few Talents unimprov'd or cross'd  Even I who on this Subject wou'd compose  Which the fam'd  Ʋrbin  for his Pencil chose  And here in tinctur'd Wool we now behold  Correctly follow'd in each Shade and Fold  Shou'd prudently from the Attempt withdraw  But Inclination proves the stronger Law  And tho' the

share his Wonder every one combines  By diff'rent Aspects shewn and diff'rent Signs  A comely Figure near the Consul plac'd  With serious Mildness and Instruction grac'd  To Others seems imparting what he saw  And shews the Wretch with reverential Awe  Whilst a more eager Person next we find  Viewing the Wizard with a Sceptick's Mind  Who his fixt Eyes so near him do's apply  We think enliv'ning Beams might from them  ly  To reinkindle by so just an Aim  The radial Sparks but lately check'd and tame  As Tapers new putout will catch approaching Flame  But dire Surprize th' Enquiry do's succeed  Whilst full Conviction in his Face we read  And He who question'd now deplores the Deed  To sacred  PAƲL  a younger Figure guides  With seeming Warmth which still in Youth presides  And pointing forward Elder Men directs  In Him to note the Cause of these Effects  Upon whose Brow do's evidently shine  Deputed Pow'r t' inflict the Wrath Divine  Whilst sad and solemn suited to their

less Wise  But to thy Portrait  ELYMAS  we come  Whose Blindness almost strikes the Poet dumb  And whilst  She  vainly to Describe thee seeks  The Pen but traces where the Pencil speaks  Of Darkness to be  felt  our Scriptures write  Thou Darken'd seem'st as thou woud'st feel the  Light  And with projected Limbs betray'st a Dread  Of unseen Mischiefs levell'd at thy Head  Thro' all thy Frame such Stupefaction reigns  As Night it self were sunk into thy Veins  Nor by the Eyes alone thy Loss we find  Each Lineament helps to proclaim thee Blind  An artful Dimness far diffus'd we grant  And failing seem all Parts through One important Want  Oh mighty  RAPHAEL  justly sure renown'd  Since in thy Works such Excellence is found  No Wonder if with Nature Thou'rt at strife  Who thus can paint the Negatives of Life  And Deprivation more expressive make  Than the most perfect Draughts which Others take  Whilst to this Chiefest Figure of the Piece  All that surround it Heightnings do encrease  In some Amazement by Extreams is shewn  Who viewing his clos'd Lids extend their Own  Nor can by that enough their Thoughts express  Which op'ning Mouths seem ready to confess  Thus stand the  LICTORS  gazing on a Deed  Which do's all humane Chastisements exceed  Enseebl'd seem their Instruments of smart  When keener Words can swifter Ills impart  Thou  BARNABAS  though Last not least our Care  Seem'st equally employ'd in Praise and Prayer  Acknowledging th' Omnipotent Decree  Yet soft Compassion in thy Face we see  Whilst lifted Hands implore a kind Relief  Tho' no Impatience animates

waits his slow returns  Where unattended Incense faintly burns  In vain the whisp'ring Priests their Fears express  And of the Change a thousand Causes guess  Heedless of all their Censures He retires  And in his Palace feeds his secret Fires  Impatient till from  Rabbah  Tydings tell  That near those Walls the poor  Ʋriah  fell  Led to the Onset by a Chosen Few  Who at the treacherous Signal soon withdrew  Nor to his Rescue e'er return'd again  Till by fierce  Ammon  's Sword they saw the Victim slain  'Tis pass'd 'tis done the holy MarriageKnot  Too strong to be unty'd at last is cut  And now to  Bathsheba  the King declares  That with his Heart the Kingdom too is hers  That  Israel  's Throne and longing Monarch's Arms  Are to be fill'd but with her widow'd Charms  Nor must the Days of formal Tears exceed  To cross the Living and abuse the Dead  This she denies and signs of Grief are worn  But mourns no more than may her Face adorn  Give to those Eyes which Love and Empire fir'd  A melting Softness more to be desir'd  Till the fixt Time tho' hard to be endur'd  Was pass'd and a sad Consort's Name procur'd  When with the Pomp that suits a Prince's Thought  By Passion sway'd and

tho' on a Prince's Brow  In what low Cave or on what Desert Coast  Now Virtue wants it is thy Presence lost  But lo he comes the Rev'rend  Bard  appears  Defil'd with Dust his awful silver Hairs  And his rough Garment wet with falling Tears  The King this mark'd and conscious wou'd have fled  The healing Balm which for his Wounds was shed  Till the more wary Priest the Serpents Art  Join'd to the Dovelike Temper of his Heart  And thus retards the Prince just ready now to part  Hear me the Cause betwixt two Neighbours hear  Thou who for Justice dost the Sceptre bear  Help the Opprest nor let me weep alone  For him that calls for Succour from the Throne  Good Princes for Protection are Ador'd  And Greater by the  Shield  than by the  Sword  This clears the Doubt and now no more he fears  The Cause his Own and therefore stays and hears  When thus the  Prophet    In a flow'ry Plain  A Kinglike Man does in full Plenty reign  Casts round his Eyes in vain to reach the Bound  Which  Jordan  's Flood sets to his fertile Ground  Countless his Flocks whilst  Lebanon  contains  A Herd as large kept by his numerous Swains  That fill with morning Bellowings the cool Air  And to the Cedar's shade at scorching Noon repair  Near to this Wood a lowly  Cottage  stands  Bullt by the humble Owner's painful Hands  Fenc'd by a Stubbleroof from Rain and Heat  Secur'd without within all Plain and Neat  A Field of small Extent surrounds the Place  In which One single  Ewe  did sport and graze  This his whole Stock till in full time there came  To bless his utmost Hopes a snowy  Lamb  Which lest the Season yet too Cold might prove  And Northern Blasts annoy it from the Grove  Or tow'ring Fowl on the weak Prey might sieze  For with his Store his  Fears  must too increase  He brings it Home and lays it by his Side  At once his Wealth his Pleasure and his Pride  Still bars the Door by Labour call'd away  And when returning at the Close of Day  With One small Mess himself and that sustains  And half his Dish it shares and half his slender Gains  When to the great Man's Table now there comes  A  Lord  as great follow'd by hungry Grooms  For these must be provided sundry Meats  The Best for Some for Others coarser Cates  One Servant diligent above the rest  To help his Master to contrive the Feast  Extols the Lamb was nourish'd with such Care  So fed so lodg'd it must be Princely

My growing Hope and Treasure of my Life  More was he speaking when the murd'ring Knife  Shew'd him his Suit tho' just must be deny'd  And the white Fleece in its own Scarlet dy'd  Whilst the poor helpless Wretch stands weeping by  And lifts his Hands for Justice to the Sky  Which he shall find th' incensed  King  replies  When for the proud Offence th' Oppressor dies  O  Nathan  by the  Holy  Name I swear  Our Land such Wrongs unpunish'd shall not bear  If with the Fault th' Offender thou declare  To whom the  Prophet  closing with the Time  Thou art the Man  replies and thine th' illnatur'd Crime  Nor think against thy Place or State I err  A Pow'r above thee does this Charge prefer  Urg'd by whose  Spirit  hither am I brought  T' expostulate his  Goodness  and thy  Fault  To lead thee back to those forgotten Years  In Labour spent and lowly Rustick Cares  When in the Wilderness thy Flocks but few  Thou didst the Shepherd's simple Art pursue  Thro' crusting Frosts and penetrating Dew  Till wondring  Jesse  saw six Brothers past  And Thou Elected Thou the Least and Last  A Sceptre to thy Rural Hand convey'd  And in thy Bosom Royal Beauties laid  A lovely Princess made thy Prize that Day  When on the shaken Ground the  Giant  lay  Stupid in Death beyond the Reach of Cries  That bore thy shouted Fame to list'ning Skies  And drove the flying Foe as fast away  As Winds of old  Locusts  to  Egypt  's Sea  Thy Heart with Love thy Temples with Renown  Th' Allgiving Hand of Heav'n did largely crown  Whilst yet thy Cheek was spread with youthful Down  What more cou'd craving Man of God implore  Or what for favour'd Man cou'd God do more  Yet cou'd not These nor  Israel  's Throne suffic  Intemp'rate Wishes drawn thro' wand'ring Eyes  One Beauty not thy own and seen by chance  Melts down the Work of Grace with an alluring Glance  Chases the Spirit fed by sacred Art  And blots the Title  AFTER GOD's OWN HEART  Black Murder breeds to level at  his  Head  Who boasts so fair a Part'ner of his Bed  Nor longer must possess those envy'd Charms  The single Treasure of his House and Arms  Giving by this thy Fall cause to Blaspheme  To all the Heathen the  Almighty  Name  For which the  Sword  shall still thy Race pursue  And in revolted  Israel  's scornful View  Thy captiv'd Wives shall be in Triumph led  Unto a bold Usurper's shameful Bed  Who from thy Bowels sprung shall seize thy Throne  And scourge thee by a Sin beyond thy own  Thou hast thy Fault in secret Darkness done  But this the World shall see before the Noonday's Sun  Enough the King enough the  Saint  replies  And pours his swift Repentance from his Eyes  Falls on the Ground and tears the Nuptial Vest  By which his Crime's Completion was exprest  Then with a Sigh blasting to Carnal Love  Drawn deep as Hell and piercing Heaven above  Let  Me  he cries let  Me  attend his Rod  For  I  have sinn'd for  I  have lost my God  Hold says the  Prophet  of that Speech beware  God ne'er was lost unless by Man's Despair  The Wound that is thus willingly reveal'd  Th' Almighty is as willing shou'd be heal'd  Thus wash'd in Tears thy Soul as fair does show  As the first Fleece which on the Lamb does grow  Or on the Mountain's top the lately fallen Snow  Yet to the World that Justice may appear  Acting her Part impartial and severe  The  Offspring  of thy Sin shall soon

Fruit for my offending Soul  Shall I no more endure the King demands  And 'scape thus lightly his offended Hands  Oh let him All resume my Crown my Fame  Reduce me to the Nothing whence I came  Call back his Favours faster than he gave  And if but Pardon'd strip me to my Grave  Since tho' he seems to  Lose  He surely  Wins  Who gives but earthly Comforts for his Sins  Part of the Fifth Scene in the Second Act of  Athalia  a Tragedy written in French by Monsieur  Racine  Enter as in the Temple of  Jerusalem ATHALIA MATHAN ABNER  Mathan  WHY to our Wonder in this Place is seen  Thus discompos'd and alter'd  Juda  's Queen  May we demand what Terrors seize your Breast  Or why your Steps are to this House addrest  Where your unguarded Person stands expos'd  To secret Foes within its Walls inclos'd  Can it be thought that you remit that Hate  Athalia  No more but Both observe what I relate  Not that I mean recalling Times of Blood  To make you Judges of the Paths I trod  VVhen to the empty'd Throne I boldly rose  Treating all Intercepters as my Foes  'Twas Heav'ns Decree that I should thus succeed  Whose following Favour justifies the Deed  Extending my unlimited Command  From Sea to Sea o'er the obedient Land  Whilst your  Jerusalem  all Peace enjoys  Nor now th' encroaching  Philistine  destroys  Nor wandring  Arab  his Pavilion spreads  Near  Jordan  's Banks nor wastes his flow'ry Meads  The great  Assyrian  Terror of your Kings  Who bought his Friendship with their holiest Things  Yields that a Sister of his pow'rful Race  Should sway these Realms and dignify the Place  Nor need we add the late insulting Foe  The furious  Jehu  does this Sceptre know  And sinks beneath the Load of conscious Fears  When in  Samaria  he my Actions hears  Distrest by Foes which I've against him rais'd  He sees me unmolested six'd and pleas'd  At least till now thus glorious was my State  But something's threatned from relaxing Fate  And the last Night which shou'd have brought me Rest  Has all these great Ideas dispossest  A  Dream  a Vision an apparent View  Of what methinks does still my Steps pursue  Hangs on my pensive Heart and bears it down  More than the weight of an objected Crown  My Mother be the Name with Rev'rence spoke  Ere chearful Day thro' horrid Shades had broke  Approach'd my Bed magnificent her Dress  Her Shape her Air did  Jesabel  confess  Nor seem'd her Face to have refus'd that Art  Which in despight of Age does Youth impart  And which she practis'd scorning to decay  Or to be vanquish'd ev'n in  Nature  's way  Thus all array'd in such defying Pride  As when th' injurious Conqu'ror she descry'd  And did in height of Pow'r for illgot Pow'r deride  To me she spake these Accents to me came  " Thou worthy Daughter of my soaring Fame  " Tho' with a more transcendent Spirit fill'd  " Tho' struggling Pow'rs attempt thy Life to shield  " The  Hebrew  's God Oh tremble at the sound  " Shall Thee and Them and all their Rights confound  A pitying Groan concludes no Word of Aid  My Arms I thought to throw about the Shade  Of that lov'd Parent but my troubled Sight  No more directed them to aim aright  Nor ought presented but a heap of Bones  For which fierce Dogs contended on the Stones  With Flakes of mangled Flesh that quiv'ring still  Proclaim'd the Freshness of the suffer'd Ill  Distain'd with Blood the

SPLEEN  which ev'ry thing dost ape  Thou  Proteus  to abus'd Mankind  Who never yet thy real Cause cou'd find  Or fix thee to remain in one continued Shape  Still varying thy perplexing Form  Now a Dead Sea thou'lt represent  A Calm of stupid Discontent  Then dashing on the Rocks wilt rage into a Storm  Trembling sometimes thou dost appear  Dissolv'd into a Panick Fear  On Sleep intruding dost thy Shadows spread  Thy gloomy Terrours round the silent Bed  And croud with boading Dreams the Melancholy Head  Or when the Midnight Hour is told  And drooping Lids thou still dost waking hold  Thy fond Delusions cheat the Eyes  Before them antick Spectres dance  Unusual Fires their pointed Heads advance  And airy Phantoms rise  Such was the monstrous  Vision  seen  When  Brutus  now beneath his Cares opprest  And all  Rome  's Fortunes rolling in his Breast  Before  Philippi  's latest Field  Before his Fate did to  Octavius  lead  Was vanquish'd by the  Spleen  Falsly the Mortal Part we blame  Of our deprest and pond'rous Frame  Which till the First degrading Sin  Let Thee its dull Attendant in  Still with the Other did comply  Nor clogg'd the Active Soul dispos'd to fly  And range the Mansions of it's native Sky  Nor whilst in his own Heaven he dwelt  Whilst Man his Paradice possest  His fertile Garden in the fragrant East  And all united Odours smelt  No armed Sweets until thy Reign  Cou'd shock the Sense or in the Face  A flusht unhandsom Colour place  Now the  Jonquille  o'ercomes the feeble Brain  We faint beneath the Aromatick Pain  Till some offensive Scent thy Pow'rs appease  And Pleasure we resign for short and nauseous Ease  In ev'ry One thou dost possess  New are thy Motions and thy Dress  Now in some Grove a list'ning Friend  Thy false Suggestions must attend  Thy whisper'd Griefs thy fancy'd Sorrows hear  Breath'd in a Sigh and witness'd by a Tear  Whilst in the light and vulgar Croud  Thy Slaves more clamorous and loud  By Laughters unprovok'd thy Influence too confess  In the Imperious  Wife  thou Vapours art  Which from o'erheated Passions rise  In Clouds to the attractive Brain  Until descending thence again  Thro' the o'ercast and show'ring Eyes  Upon her Husband's soften'd Heart  He the disputed Point must yield  Something resign of the contested Field  Till Lordly  Man  born to Imperial Sway  Compounds for Peace to make that Right away  And  Woman  arm'd with  Spleen  do's servilely Obey  The  Fool  to imitate the Wits  Complains of thy pretended Fits  And Dulness born with him wou'd lay  Upon thy accidental Sway  Because sometimes thou dost presume  Into the ablest Heads to come  That often Men of Thoughts refin'd  Impatient of unequal Sence  Such slow Returns where they so much dispense  Retiring from the Croud are to thy Shades inclin'd  O'er me alas thou dost too much prevail  I feel thy Force whilst I against thee rail  I feel my Verse decay and my crampt Numbers fail  Thro' thy black Jaundice I all Objects see  As Dark and Terrible as Thee  My Lines decry'd and my Employment thought  An useless Folly or presumptuous Fault  Whilst in the  Muses  Paths I stray  Whilst in their Groves and by their secret Springs  My Hand delights to trace unusual Things  And deviates from the known and common way  Nor will in fading Silks compose  Faintly th' inimitable  Rose  Fill up an illdrawn  Bird  or paint on Glass  The  Sov'reign  's blurr'd and undistinguish'd Face  The threatning  Angel  and the speaking  Ass  Patron thou art to ev'ry gross Abuse  The sullen  Husband  's feign'd Excuse  When the ill Humour with his Wife he spends  And bears recruited Wit and Spirits to his Friends  The Son of  Bacchus  pleads thy Pow'r  As to the Glass he still repairs  Pretends but to remove thy Cares  Snatch from thy Shades one gay and smiling Hour  And drown thy Kingdom in a purple Show'r  When the  Coquette  whom ev'ry Fool admires  Wou'd in Variety be Fair  And changing hastily the Scene  From Light Impertinent and Vain  Assumes a soft a melancholy Air  And of her Eyes rebates the wand'ring Fires  The careless Posture and the Head reclin'd  The thoughtful and composed Face  Proclaiming the withdrawn the absent Mind  Allows the Fop more liberty to gaze  Who gently for the tender Cause inquires  The Cause indeed is a Defect in Sense  Yet is the  Spleen  alledg'd and still the dull Pretence  But these are thy fantastick Harms  The Tricks of thy pernicious Stage  Which do the weaker Sort engage  Worse are the dire Effects of thy more pow'rful Charms  By Thee  Religion  all we know  That shou'd enlighten here below  Is veil'd in Darkness and perplext  With anxious Doubts with endless Scruples vext  And some Restraint imply'd from each perverted Text  Whilst  Touch  not  Taste  not what is freely giv'n  Is but thy niggard Voice disgracing bounteous Heav'n  From Speech restrain'd by thy Deceits abus'd  To Desarts banish'd or in Cells reclus'd  Mistaken Vot'ries to the Pow'rs Divine  Whilst they a purer Sacrifice design  Do but the  Spleen  obey and worship at thy Shrine  In vain to chase thee ev'ry Art we try  In vain all Remedies apply  In vain the  Indian  Leaf infuse  Or the parch'd  Eastern  Berry bruise  Some pass in vain those Bounds and nobler Liquors use  Now  Harmony  in vain we bring  Inspire the Flute and touch the String  From Harmony no help is had  Musick  but soothes thee if too sweetly sad  And if too light but turns thee gayly Mad  Tho' the Physicians greatest Gains  Altho' his growing Wealth he sees  Daily encreas'd by Ladies Fees  Yet dost thou baffle all his studious Pains  Not skilful  Lower  thy Source cou'd find  Or thro' the welldissected Body trace  The secret the mysterious ways  By which thou dost surprize and prey upon the Mind  Tho' in the Search

could impart  As well my vital Spirits to thy Heart  That when the fierce Distemper thine wou'd quell  They might renew the Fight and the cold Foe repel  As on  Arbela  's Plains we turn'd the Day

my Wishes to my fond Embrace  Thy Looks the same the same Majestick Grace  That round thee shone when we together went  To chear the Royal Captives in their Tent  Where  Sysigambis  prostrate on the Floor  Did  Alexander  in thy Form adore  Above great  Aesculapius  shou'd he stand  Or made immortal by  Apelles  Hand  But no reviving Hope his Art allows  And such cold Damps invade my anxious Brows  As when in  Cydnus  plung'd I dar'd the Flood  T' o'ermatch the Boilings of my youthful Blood  But  Philip  to my aid repair'd in haste  And whilst the proffer'd Draught I boldly taste  As boldly He the dangerous Paper views  Which of hid Treasons does his Fame accuse  More thy Physician's Life on Thine depends  And what he gives his Own preserves or ends  If thou expir'st beneath his fruitless Care  To  Rhadamanthus  shall the Wretch repair  And give strict Answer for his Errors there  Near thy Pavilion list'ning  Princes  wait  Seeking from thine to learn their  Monarch  's State  Submitting  Kings  that post from Day to Day  To keep those Crowns which at my Feet they lay  Forget th' ambitious Subject of their Speed  And here arriv'd only Thy Dangers heed  The  Beauties  of the Clime now Thou'rt away  Droop and retire as if their God of Day  No more upon their early Pray'rs wou'd shine  Or take their Incense at his late Decline  Thy  Parisatis  whom I fear to name  Lest to thy Heat it add redoubl'd Flame  Thy lovely Wife thy  Parisatis  weeps  And in her Grief a solemn Silence keeps  Stretch'd in her Tent upon the Floor she lies  So pale her Looks so motionless her Eyes  As when they gave thee leave at first to gaze  Upon the Charms of her unguarded Face  When the two beauteous Sisters lowly knelt  And su'd to those who more than Pity felt  To chear her now  Statira  vainly proves  And at thy Name alone she sighs and moves  But why these single Griefs shou'd I expose  The World no Mirth no War no Bus'ness knows  But hush'd with Sorrow stands to favour thy Repose  Ev'n I my boasted Title now resign  Not  Ammon  's Son nor born of Race Divine  But Mortal all oppress'd with restless Fears  Wild with my Cares and Womanish in Tears  Tho' Tears before I for old  Clytus  shed  And wept more Drops than the old Hero bled  Ev'n now methinks I see him on the Ground  Now my dire Arms the wretched Corpse surround  Now the fled Soul I wooe now rave upon the Wound  Yet He for whom this mighty Grief did spring  Not  Alexander  valu'd but the King  Then think how much that Passion must transcend  Which not a Subject raises but a Friend  An equal Partner in the vanquish'd Earth  A Brother not impos'd upon my Birth  Too weak a Tye unequal Thoughts to bind  But by the gen'rous Motions of the Mind  My Love to thee for Empire was the Test  Since him who from Mankind cou'd chuse the best  The Gods thought only fit for Monarch o'er the rest  Live then my Friend but if that must not be  Nor Fate will with my boundless Mind agree  Affording at one time the

resolving to banish all Sense of the Pain  And pursue thro' her Death a Revenge on the Swain  Since the Gods and my Passion at once he defies  Since his Vanity lives whilst my Character dies  No more did she say will I trifle with Fate  But commit to the Waves both my Love and my Hate  And now to comply with that furious Desire  Just ready to plunge and alone to expire  Some Reflections on Death

Madam  Deshouliers  returning Money she had lent him at  Bassette  upon the first Day of their Acquaintance  Translated with Liberty from the  French  URANIA  whom the Town admires  Whose Wit and Beauty share our Praise  This fair  ƲRANIA  who inspires  A thousand Joys a thousand ways  She who cou'd with a Glance convey  Favours that had my Hopes outdone  Has lent me Money on that Day  Which our Acquaintance first begun  Nor with the Happiness I taste  Let any jealous Doubts contend  Her Friendship is secure to last  Beginning where all others end  And thou known Cheat upheld by Law  Thou Disappointer of the craving Mind  BASSETTE who thy Original dost draw  From  Venice  by uncertain Seas confin'd  Author of Murmurs and of Care  Of pleasing Hopes concluding in Despair  To thee my strange Felicity I owe  From thy Oppression did this Succour flow  Less had I gain'd had'st thou propitious been  Who better by my Loss hast taught me how to Win  Yet tell me my transported Brain  whose Pride this Benefit awakes  Know'st thou what on this Chance depends  And are we not exalted thus in vain  Whilst we observe the Money which she lends  But not alas the Heart she takes  The fond Engagements and the Ties  Her fatal Bounty does impose  Who makes Reprisals with her Eyes  For what her gen'rous Hand bestows  And tho' I quickly can return  Those useful Pieces which she gave  Can I again or wou'd I have  That which her Charms have from me borne  Yet let us quit th' obliging Score  And whilst we borrow'd Gold restore  Whilst readily we own the Debt  And Gratitude before her set  In its approv'd and fairest Light  Let her effectually be taught  By that instructive harmless Slight  That also in  her  turn she ought  Repaying ev'ry tender Thought  Kindness with Kindness to

Martial Crowns Fatigues demand  And laurell'd Heroes must be tann'd  A Fate we never can allow  Shou'd reach your pleasing polish'd Brow  But granting what so young you've writ  From Nature flow'd as

gain'd  And trust it will be well maintain'd  Who knows but some imprudent  She  Betraying what's secur'd by me  Shall yield thro' Verse or stronger Charms  To Treat anew on easier Terms  And I be negligently told  You was too  Young  and I too  Old  To have our distant Maxims hold  To the Painter of an illdrawn Picture of  CLEONE  the Honorable Mrs  Thynne  SOoner I'd praise a Cloud which Light beguiles  Than thy rash Hand which robs this Face of Smiles  And does that sweet and pleasing Air controul  Which to us paints the fair  CLEONE  's Soul  'Tis vain to boast of Rules or labour'd Art  I miss the Look that captivates my Heart  Attracts my Love and tender Thoughts inspires  Nor can my Breast be warm'd by common Fires  Nor can  ARDELIA  love but where she first admires  Like  Jupiter  's thy Head was sure in Pain  When this Virago struggl'd in thy Brain  And strange it is thou hast not made her wield  A mortal Dart or penetrating Shield  Giving that Hand of disproportion'd size  The Pow'r of which thou hast disarm'd her Eyes  As if like  Amazons  she must oppose  And into Lovers force her vanquish'd Foes  Had to  THEANOR  thus her Form been shown  To gain her Heart he had not lost his own  Nor by the gentle Bands of Human Life  At once secur'd the Mistress and the Wife  For still  CLEONE  's Beauties are the same  And what first lighten'd still upholds his Flame  Fain his Compassion wou'd thy Works approve  Were pitying thee consistent with his Love  Or with the Taste which  Italy  has wrought  In his refin'd and daily heighten'd Thought  Where Poetry or Painting find no place  Unless perform'd with a superior Grace  Cou'd but my Wish some Influence infuse  Ne'er shou'd the Pencil or the SisterMuse  Be try'd by those who easily excuse  But strictest Censors shou'd of either judge  Applaud the Artist and despise the Drudge  Then never wou'd thy Colours have debas'd  CLEONE  's Features and her Charms defac'd  Nor had my Pen more subject to their Laws  Assay'd to vindicate her Beauty's Cause  A rigid Fear had kept us both in Awe  Nor I compos'd nor thou presum'd to draw  But in  CLEONE  viewing with Surprize  That Excellence to which we ne'er cou'd rise  By less Attempts we safely might have gain'd  That humble Praise which neither has obtain'd  Since to thy Shadowings or my ruder Verse  It is not giv'n to shew or to rehearse  What Nature in  CLEONE  's Face has writ  A soft Endearment and a chearful Wit  That allsubduing that enliv'ning Air  By which a sympathizing Joy we share  For who forbears to smile when smil'd on by the Fair  A Pastoral  DIALOGUE  between Two Shepherdesses  Silvia  PRetty Nymph within this Shade  Whilst the Flocks to rest are laid  Whilst the World dissolves in Heat  Take this cool and flow'ry Seat  And with pleasing Talk a while  Let us two the Time beguile  Tho' thou here no Shepherd see  To encline his humble Knee  Or with melancholy Lays  Sing thy dangerous Beauty's Praise  Dorinda  Nymph with thee I here wou'd stay  But have heard that on this Day  Near those Beeches scarce in view  All the Swains some Mirth pursue  To whose meeting now I haste  Solitude do's Life but waste  Silvia  Prithee but a Moment stay  Dorinda  No my Chaplet wou'd decay  Ev'ry drooping Flow'r wou'd mourn  And wrong the Face they shou'd adorn  Silvia  I can tell thee tho' so Fair  And dress'd with all that rural Care  Most of the admiring Swains  Will be absent from the Plains  Gay  Sylvander  in the Dance  Meeting with a shrew'd Mischance  To his Cabin's now confin'd  By  Mopsus  who the Strain did bind  Damon  through the Woods do's stray  Where his Kids have lost their way  Young  Narcissus  iv'ry Brow  Rac'd by a malicious Bough  Keeps the girilish Boy from sight  Till Time shall do his Beauty right  Dorinda  Where's  Alexis  Silvia  He alas  Lies extended on the Grass  Tears his Garland raves despairs  Mirth and Harmony forswears  Since he was this Morning shown  That  Delia  must not be his Own  Dorinda  Foolish Swain such Love to place  Silvia  On any but  Dorinda  's Face  Dorinda  Hasty Nymph I said not so  Silvia  Nobut I thy Meaning know  Ev'ry Shepherd thou wou'd'st have  Not thy Lover but thy Slave  To encrease thy captive Train  Never to be lov'd again  But since all are now away  Prithee but a Moment stay  Dorinda  No the Strangers from the Vale  Sure will not this Meeting fail  Graceful one the other Fair  He too with the pensive Air  Told me ere he came this way  He was wont to look more Gay  Silvia  See how Pride thy Heart inclines  To think for Thee that Shepherd pines  When those Words that reach'd thy Ear  Chloe  was design'd to hear  Chloe  who did near thee stand  And his more speaking Looks command  Dorinda  Now thy Envy makes me smile  That indeed were worth his while  Chloe  next thyself decay'd  And no more a courted Maid  Silvia  Next myself Young Nymph forbear  Still the Swains allow me Fair  Tho' not what I was that Day  When  Colon  bore the Prize away  When  Dorinda  Oh hold that Tale will last  Till all the Evening Sports are past  Till no Streak of Light is seen  Nor Footstep prints the flow'ry Green  What thou wert I need not know  What I am must haste to show  Only this I now discern  From the things thou'd'st have me learn  That Womankind's peculiar Joys  From past or present Beauties rise  ALCIDOR  WHile Monarchs in stern Battle strove  For proud Imperial Sway  Abandon'd to his milder Love  Within a silent peaceful Grove  Alcidor  careless lay  Some term'd it cold unmanly Fear  Some Nicety of Sense  That Drums and Trumpets cou'd not hear  The sullying Blasts of Powder bear  Or with foul Camps dispense  A patient Martyr to their Scorn  And each illfashion'd Jest  The Youth who but for Love was born  Remain'd and thought it vast Return  To reign in  Cloria  's Breast  But oh a ruffling Soldier came  In all the Pomp of War  The  Gazettes  long had spoke his Fame  Now Hautboys his Approach proclaim  And draw in Crouds from far  Cloria  unhappily wou'd gaze  And as he nearer drew  The Man of Feather and of Lace  Stopp'd short and with profound Amaze  Took all her Charms to view  A Bow which from Campaigns he brought  And to his Holsters low  Herself and the Spectators taught  That Her the fairest Nymph he thought  Of all that form'd the Row  Next day ere  Phoebus  cou'd be seen  Or any Gate unbarr'd  At hers upon th' adjoining Green  From Ranks with waving Flags between  Were soften'd Trumpets heard  The Noon do's following Treats provide  In the Pavilion's Shade  The Neighbourhood and all beside  That will attend the amorous Pride  Are welcom'd with the Maid  Poor  Alcidor  thy Hopes are cross'd  Go perish on the Ground  Thy Sighs by stronger Notes are toss'd  Drove back or in the Passage lost  Rich Wines thy Tears have drown'd  In  Women  's Hearts the softest Things  Which Nature cou'd devise  Are yet some harsh and jarring Strings  That when loud Fame or Profit rings  Will answer to the Noise  Poor  Alcidor  go Fight or Dye  Let thy fond Notions cease  Man was not made in Shades to lie  Or his full Bliss at ease enjoy  To Live or Love in peace  Some Pieces out of the first  ACT  of the  AMINTA  of  TASSO  Daphne  's Answer to  Sylvia  declaring she should esteem all as Enemies who should talk to her of LOVE  THEN to the snowy  Ewe  in thy esteem  The Father of the Flock a Foe must seem  The faithful  Turtles  to their yielding Mates  The chearful  Spring  which Love and Joy creates  That reconciles the World by soft Desires  And tender Thoughts in ev'ry Breast inspires  To you a hateful Season must appear  Whilst  Love  prevails and all are  Lovers  here  Observe the gentle Murmurs of that  Dove  And see how billing she confirms her Love  For this the  Nightingale  displays her Throat  And  Love Love Love  is all her Ev'ning Note  The very  Tygers  have their tender Hours  And prouder  Lyons  bow beneath  Love  's Pow'rs  Thou  prouder yet than that imperious Beast  Alone deny'st him Shelter in thy Breast  But why should I the Creatures only name  That Sense partake as Owners of this Flame  Love  farther goes nor stops his Course at these  The  Plants  he moves and gently bends the  Trees  See how those  Willows  mix their am'rous Boughs  And how that  Vine  clasps her supporting Spouse  The silver  Firr  dotes on the stately Pine  By Love those  Elms  by Love those  Beeches  join  But view that  Oak  behold his rugged Side  Yet that rough Bark the melting Flame do's hide  All by their trembling Leaves in Sighs declare  And tell their Passions to the gath'ring Air  Which had but Love o'er Thee the least Command  Thou by their Motions too might'st understand  AMINTOR  being ask'd by  THIRSIS  Who is the Object of his Love speaks as follows  Amint  THIRSIS  to Thee I mean that Name to show  Which only yet our Groves and Fountains know  That when my Death shall through the Plains be told  Thou with the wretched Cause may'st that unfold  To everyone who shall my Story find  Carv'd by thy Hand in some fair Beeches rind  Beneath whose Shade the bleeding Body lay  That when by chance she shall be led that way  O'er my sad Grave the haughty Nymph may go  And the proud Triumph of her Beauty shew  To all the Swains to Strangers as they pass  And yet at length she may but Oh alas  I fear too high my flatt'ring Hopes do soar  Yet she at length may my sad Fate deplore  May weep me Dead may o'er my Tomb recline  And sighing wish were he alive and Mine  But mark me to the End  Thir  Go on for well I do thy Speech attend  Perhaps to better Ends than yet thou know'st  Amint  Being now a Child or but a Youth  mo  When scarce to reach the blushing Fruit I knew  Which on the lowest bending Branches grew  Still with the dearest sweetest kindest Maid  Young as myself at childish Sports I play'd  The Fairest sure of all that Lovely Kind  Who spread their golden Tresses to the Wind  Cydippe  's Daughter and  Montano  's Heir  Whose Flocks and Herds so num'rous do appear  The beauteous  Sylvia  She 'tis She I love  Warmth of all Hearts and Pride of ev'ry Grove  With Her I liv'd no Turtles e'er so fond  Our Houses met but more our Souls were join'd  Together Nets for Fish and Fowl we laid  Together through the spacious Forest stray'd  Pursu'd with equal Speed the flying Deer  And of the Spoils there no Divisions were  But whilst I from the Beasts their Freedom won  Alas I know not how my Own was gone  By unperceiv'd Degrees the Fire encreas'd  Which fill'd at last each corner of my Breast  As from a Root tho' scarce discern'd so small  A Plant may rise that grows amazing tall  From  Sylvia  's Presence now I could not move  And from her Eyes took in full Draughts of Love  Which sweetly thro' my ravish'd Mind distill'd  et in the end such Bitterness wou'd yield  That oft I sigh'd ere yet I knew the cause  And was a Lover ere I dream'd I was  But Oh at last too well my State I knew  And now will shew thee how this Passion grew  Then listen while the pleasing Tale I tell  THIRSIS  persuades  AMINTOR  not to despair upon the Predictions of  Mopsus  discov'ring him to be an Impostor  Thirsis  WHY dost thou still give way to such Despair  Amintor  Too just alas the weighty Causes are  Mopsus  wise  Mopsus  who in Art excels  And of all Plants the secret Vertue tells  Knows with what healing Gifts our Spring a bound  And of each Bird explains the mystick Sound  'Twas He ev'n He my wretched Fate foretold  Thir  Dost thou this Speech then of that  Mops  hold  Who whilst his Smiles attract the easy View  Drops flatt'ring Words soft as the falling Dew  Whose outward Form all friendly still appears  Tho' Fraud and Daggers in his Thoughts he wears  And the unwary Labours to surprize  With Looks affected and with riddling Lyes  If He it is that bids thy Love despair  I hope the happier End of all thy Care  So far from Truth his vain Predictions fall  Amint  If ought thou know'st that may my Hopes recall  Conceal it not for great I've heard his Fame  And fear'd his Words  Thir  When hither first I came  And in these Shades the false Impostor met  Like Thee I priz'd and thought his Judgment great  On all his study'd Speeches still rely'd  Nor fear'd to err whilst led by such a Guide  When on a Day that Bus'ness and Delight  My Steps did to the Neighb'ring Town invite  Which stands upon that rising Mountain's side  And from our Plains this River do's divide  He check'd me thusBe warn'd in time My Son  And that new World of painted Mischiefs shun  Whose gay Inhabitants thou shalt behold  Plum'd like our Birds and sparkling all in Gold  Courtiers  that will thy rustick Garb despise  And mock thy Plainness with disdainful Eyes  But above all that Structure see thou fly  Where hoarded Vanities and Witchcrafts lie  To shun that Path be thy peculiar Care  I ask what of that Place the Dangers are  To which he soon replies there shalt thou meet  Of soft Enchantresses th' Enchantments sweet  Who subt'ly will thy solid Sense bereave  And a false Gloss to ev'ry Object give  Brass to thy Sight as polish'd Gold shall seem  And Glass thou as the Diamond shalt esteem  Huge Heaps of Silver to thee shall appear  Which if approach'd will prove but shining Air  The very Walls by Magick Art are wrought  And Repetition to all Speakers taught  Not such as from our Ecchoes we obtain  Which only our last Words return again  But Speech for Speech entirely there they give  And often add beyond what they receive  Their downy Couches to false Rest invite  The Lawn is charm'd that faintly bars the Light  No gilded Seat no iv'ry Board is there  But what thou may'st for some Delusion fear  Whilst farther to abuse thy wond'ring Eyes  Strange antick Shapes before them shall arise  Fantastick Fiends that will about thee flock  And all they see with Imitation mock  Nor are these Ills the worst Thyself may'st be  Transform'd into a Flame a Stream a Tree  A Tear congeal'd by Art thou may'st remain  'Till by a burning Sigh dissolv'd again  Thus spake the Wretch but cou'd not shake my Mind  My way I take and soon the City find  Where above all that lofty Fabrick stands  Which with one View the Town and Plains commands  Here was I stopt for who cou'd quit the Ground  That heard such Musick from those Roofs resound  Musick beyond th' enticing  Syrene  's Note  Musick beyond the Swan's expiring Throat  Beyond the softest Voice that charms the Grove  And equal'd only by the Spheres above  My Ear I thought too narrow for the Art  Nor fast enough convey'd it to my Heart  When in the Entrance of the Gate I saw  A Man Majestick and commanding Awe  Yet temper'd with a Carriage so refin'd  That undetermin'd was my doubtful Mind  Whether for Love or War that Form was most design'd  With such a Brow as did at once declare  A gentle Nature and a Wit severe  To view that Palace me he ask'd to go  Tho' Royal He and I Obscure and Low  But the Delights my Senses there did meet  No rural Tongue no Swain can c'er repeat  Celestial Goddesses or Nymphs as Fair  In unveil'd Beauties to all Eyes appear  Sprinkl'd with Gold as glorious to the View  As young  Aurora  deck'd with pearly Dew  Bright Rays dispensing as along they pass'd  And with new Light the shining Palace grac'd  Phabus  was there by all the Muses met  And at his Feet was our  Elpino  set  Ev'n humble Me their Harmony inspir'd  My Breast expanded and my Spirits fir'd  Rude Past'ral now no longer I rehearse  But Heroes crown with my exalted Verse  Of Arms I sung of bold advent'rous Wars  And tho' brought back by my too envious Stars  Yet kept my Voice and Reed those lofty Strains  And sent loud Musick through the wond'ring Plains  Which  Mopsus  hearing secretly malign'd  And now to ruin Both at once design'd  Which by his Sorceries he soon brought to pass  And suddenly so clogg'd and hoarse I was  That all our Shepherds at the Change amaz'd  Believ'd I on some  Ev'ningWolf  had gaz'd  When He it was my luckless Path had crost  By whose dire Look my Skill awhile was lost  This have I told to raise thy Hopes again  And render by distrust his Malice vain  From the  AMINTA  of  TASSO  THO' we of small Proportion see  And slight the armed Golden  Bee  Yet if her Sting behind she leaves  No Ease th' envenom'd Flesh receives  Love  less to Sight than is this Fly  In a soft  Curl  conceal'd can lie  Under an  Eyelid's  lovely Shade  Can form a dreadful Ambuscade  Can the most subtil Sight beguile  Hid in the Dimples of a  Smile  But if from thence a Dart he throw  How sure how mortal is the Blow  How helpless all the Pow'r of Art  To bind or to restore the Heart  From the  AMINTA  of  TASSO  Part of the Description of the Golden Age  THEN  by some Fountains flow'ry side  The Loves unarm'd did still abide  Then the loos'd Quiver careless hung  The Torch extinct the Bow unstrung  Then by the Nymphs no Charms were worn  But such as with the Nymphs were born  The Shepherd cou'd not then complain  Nor told his am'rous Tale in vain  No Veil the Beauteous Face did hide  Nor harmless Freedom was deny'd  Then Innocence and Virtue reign'd  Pure unaffected unconstrain'd  Love was their Pleasure and their Praise  The soft Employment of their Days  To the  NIGHTINGALE  EXert thy Voice sweet Harbinger of Spring  This Moment is thy Time to Sing  This Moment I attend to Praise  And set my Numbers to thy Layes  Free as thine shall be my Song  As thy Musick short or long  Poets wild as thee were born  Pleasing best when unconfin'd  When to Please is least design'd  Soothing but their Cares to rest  Cares do still their Thoughts molest  And still th' unhappy Poet's Breast  Like thine when best he sings is plac'd against a Thorn  She begins Let all be still  Muse thy Promise now fulfill  Sweet oh sweet still sweeter yet  Can thy Words such Accents fit  Canst thou Syllables refine  Melt a Sense that shall retain  Still some Spirit of the Brain  Till with Sounds like these it join  'Twill not be then change thy Note  Let Division shake thy Throat  Hark Division now she tries  Yet as far the Muse outslies  Cease then prithee cease thy Tune  Trifler wilt thou sing till  June  Till thy Bus'ness all lies waste  And the Time of Building's past  Thus we Poets that have Speech  Unlike what thy Forests teach  If a fluent Vein be shown  That's transcendent to our own  Criticize reform or preach  Or censure what we cannot reach  The  ATHEIST  and the  ACORN  MEthinks this World is oddly made  And ev'ry thing's amiss  A dull presuming Atheist said  As stretch'd he lay beneath a Shade  And instanced in this  Behold quoth he that mighty thing  A  Pumpkin  large and round  Is held but by a little String  Which upwards cannot make it spring  Or bear it from the Ground  Whilst on this  Oak  a Fruit so small  So disproportion'd grows  That who with Sence surveys this  All  This universal Casual Ball  Its ill Contrivance knows  My better Judgment wou'd have hung  That Weight upon a Tree  And left this Mast thus slightly strung  'Mongst things which on the Surface sprung  And small and feeble be  No more the Caviller cou'd say  Nor farther Faults descry  For as he upwards gazing lay  An  Acorn  loosen'd from the Stay  Fell down upon his Eye  Th' offended Part with Tears ran o'er  As punish'd for the Sin  Fool had that Bough a  Pumpkin  bore  Thy Whimseys must have work'd no more  Nor Scull had kept them in  The  Tradesman  and the  Scholar  A Citizen of mighty Pelf  But much a Blockhead in himself  Disdain'd a Man of shining Parts  Master of Sciences and Arts  Who left his Book scarce once a day  For sober Coffee Smoak or Tea  Nor spent more Money in the Town  Than bought when need requir'd a Gown  Which way of Living much offends  The  Alderman  who gets and spends  And grudges him the Vital Air  Who drives no Trade and takes no Care  Why  Bookworm  to him once he cry'd  Why setting thus the World aside  Dost thou thy useless Time consume  Enclos'd within a lonely Room  And poring damnify thy Wit  'Till not for Men or Manners fit  Hop'st thou with urging of thy Vein  To spin a Fortune from thy Brain  Or gain a Patron that shall raise  Thy solid State for empty Praise  No trust not to your Soothings vile  Receiv'd per me  's the only Stile  Your Book's but frown'd on by My Lord  If Mine's uncross'd I reach his Board  In slighting Yours he shuts his Hand  Protracting Mine devolves the Land  Then let Advantage be the Test  Which of us Two ev'n Writes the best  Besides I often Scarlet wear  And strut to Church just next the  Mayor  Whilst rusty Black with Inch of Band  Is all the Dress you understand  Who in the Pulpit thresh to Please  Whilst I below can snore at Ease  Yet if you prove me there a Sinner  I let you go without a Dinner  This Prate was so beneath the Sence  Of One who Wisdom cou'd dispense  Unheard or unreturn'd it past  But War now lays the City waste  And plunder'd Goods profusely sell  By length of Pike not length of Ell  Abroad th' Inhabitants are forc'd  From Shops and Trade and Wealth divorc'd  The Student leaving but his Book  The Tumult of the Place forsook  In foreign Parts One

English Laquar  there  No Luxury's by either unenjoy'd  Or cost withheld tho' awkwardly employ'd  How comes this Wealth a Country Friend demands  Who scarce cou'd live on Product of his Lands  How is it that when Trading is so bad  That some are Broke and some with Fears run Mad  You can in better State yourself maintain  And your Effects still unimpair'd remain  My  Industry  he cries is all the Cause  Sometimes I interlope and slight the Laws  I wiser Measures than my Neighbours take  And better speed who better Bargains make  I knew the  Smyrna  Fleet wou'd fall a Prey  And therefore sent no Vessel out that way  My busy Factors prudently I chuse  And in streight Bonds their Friends and Kindred noose  At Home I to the Publick Sums advance  Whilst underhand in Fee with hostile  France  I

demands where such right Schemes were bred  What Phrenzy what Delirium mars the Scull  Which fill'd the Chests and was it self so full  Here interrupting sadly he Reply'd  In Me's no Change but Fate must all Things guide  To  Providence  I attribute my Loss  Vainglorious Man do's thus the Praise engross  When Prosp'rous Days around him spread their Beams  But if revolv'd to opposite Extreams  Still his own Sence he fondly will prefer  And Providence not He in his Affairs must Err  The  Eagle  the  Sow  and the  Cat  THE Queen of Birds t'encrease the Regal Stock  Had hatch'd her young Ones in a stately Oak  Whose Middlepart was by a  Cat  possest  And near the Root with Litter warmly drest  A teeming  Sow  had made her peaceful Nest  Thus Palaces are cramm'd from Roof to Ground  And Animals as various in them found  When to the  Sow  who no Misfortune fear'd  Puss  with her fawning Compliments appear'd  Rejoicing much at her Deliv'ry past  And that she 'scap'd so well who bred so fast  Then every little  Piglin  she commends  And likens them to all their swinish Friends  Bestows good Wishes but with Sighs implies  That some dark Fears do in her Bosom rise  Such tempting Flesh she cries will  Eagles  spare  Methinks good Neighbour you shou'd live in Care  Since I who bring not forth such dainty Bits  Tremble for my unpalatable Chits  And had I but foreseen the  Eagle  's Bed  Was in this fatal Tree to have been spread  I sooner wou'd have kitten'd in the Road  Than made this Place of Danger my abode  I heard her young Ones lately cry for  Pig  And pity'd you that were so near and big  In Friendship this I secretly reveal  Lest Pettitoes shou'd make th' ensuing Meal  Or else perhaps Yourself may be their aim  For a  Sow's Paps  has been a Dish of Fame  No more the sad affrighted Mother hears  But overturning all with boist'rous Fears  She from her helpless Young in haste departs  Whilst  Puss  ascends to practise farther Arts  The Antichamber pass'd she scratch'd the Door  The  Eagle  ne'er alarum'd so before  Bids her come in and look the Cause be great  That makes her thus disturb the Royal Seat  Nor think of Mice and Rats some pest'ring Tale  Shall in excuse of Insolence prevail  Alas my Gracious Lady quoth the  Cat  I think not of such Vermin Mouse or Rat  To me are tasteless grown nor dare I stir  To use my Phangs or to expose my Fur  A Foe intestine threatens all around  And ev'n this lofty Structure will confound  A Pestilential  Sow  a meazel'd Pork  On the Foundation has been long at work  Help'd by a Rabble issu'd from her Womb

some fifteen Years had told  Design'd their  Ass  to sell and for the Fair  Some distance off accordingly prepare  But lest she in the walk should lose her Flesh  And not appear for Sale so full and fresh  Her Feet together ty'd between them two  They heav'd her up and on the Rusticks go  Till those who met them bearing thus the  Ass  Cry'd Are these Fools about to act a Farce  Surely the Beast howe'er it seem to be  Is not the greatest Ass of all the Three  The  Miller  in their Mirth his Folly finds  And down he sets her and again unbinds  And tho' her grumbling shew'd she lik'd m  me  The lazy way she travell'd in before  He minds her not but up the  Boy  he sets  Upon her Back and on the Crupper gets  Thus on they jog when of Three Men that pass'd  The eldest thinking Age to be disgrac'd  Call'd to the Youth ho you young Man for shame  Come down lest Passengers your Manners blame  And say it ill becomes your tender Years  To ride before a Grandsire with grey Hairs  Truly the Gentlemen are in the right  The  Miller  cries and makes the Boy alight  Then forward slides himself into his place  And with a Mind content renews his pace  But much he had not gain'd upon his way  Before a Troop of Damsels neat and gay  Partial to Youth to one another cry'd  See how with walking by that Dotard's side  The  Boy  is tir'd whilst with a Prelate's state  He rides alone and dangling in the Seat  Hangs like a Calf thrown up across the Beast  The  Miller  thinking to have spoil'd that Jest  Reply'd he was too Old for Veal to pass  But after more on him and on his Ass  He stands convinc'd and takes his Son again  To ride at ease himself still next the Mane  Yet ere he'd thirty Paces borne the Lad  The next they met cry'dAre these Fellows mad  Have they no Pity thus t'o'erload the Jade  Sure at the Fair they for her Skin may trade  See how's she spent and sinks beneath their strokes  The  Miller  whom this most of all provokes  Swears by his Cap he shews his want of Brains  Who thus to please the World bestows his Pains  Howe'er we'll try if this way't may be done  And off he comes and fetches down his Son  Behind they walk and now the Creature drive  But cou'd no better in their Purpose thrive  Nor scape a Fellow's Censure whom they meet  That cries to spare the  Ass  they break their Feet  And whilst unladen at her ease she goes  Trudge in the Dirt and batter out their Shooes  As if to burthen her they were afraid  And Men for Beasts not Beasts for Men were mad  The Proverb right  the Cart before the Horse  The  Miller  finding things grow worse and worse  Cries out I am an Ass it is agreed  And so are all who wou'd in this succeed  Hereafter tho' Reproof or Praise I find  I'll neither heed but follow my own Mind  Take my own Counsel how my Beast to

YOU have obey'd you WINDS that must fulfill  The Great Disposer's righteous Will  Throughout the Land unlimited you flew  Nor sought as heretofore with Friendly Aid  Only new Motion to bestow  Upon the sluggish Vapours bred below  Condensing into Mists and melancholy Shade  No more such gentle Methods you pursue  But marching now in terrible Array  Undistinguish'd was your Prey  In vain the  Shrubs  with lowly Bent  Sought their Destruction to prevent  The  Beech  in vain with outstretch'd Arms  Deprecates th' approaching Harms  In vain the  Oak  so often storm'd  Rely'd upon that native Force  By which already was perform'd  So much of his appointed Course  As made him fearless of Decay  Wait but the accomplish'd Time  Of his longwish'd and useful Prime  To be remov'd with Honour to the Sea  The strait and ornamental  Pine  Did in the like Ambition joyn  And thought his Fame shou'd ever last  When in some Royal Ship he stood the planted Mast  And shou'd again his Length of Timber

form'd a Wood  You who on Mountains chose to rise  And drew them nearer to the Skies  Or you whom Valleys late did hold  In flexible and lighter Mould  You num'rous Brethren of the Leafy Kind  To whatsoever Use design'd  Now vain you found it to contend  With not alas one Element your Friend  Your Mother Earth thro' long preceding Rains  Which undermining sink below  No more her wonted Strength retains  Nor you so fix'd within her Bosom grow  That for your sakes she can resolve to bear  These furious Shocks of hurrying Air  But finding All you Ruin did conspire  She soon her beauteous Progeny resign'd  To this destructive this imperious Wind  That check'd your nobler Aims and gives you to the Fire  Thus have thy Cedars  Libanus  been struck  As the lythe Oziers twisted round  Thus  Cadez  has thy Wilderness been shook  When the apalling and tremendous Sound  Of rattl'ing Tempests o'er you broke  And made your stubborn Glories bow  When in such Whirlwinds the  Almighty  spoke  Warning  Judea  then as our  Britannia  now  Yet these were the remoter Harms  Foreign the Care and distant the Alarms  Whilst but sheltring Trees alone  Master'd soon and soon

you his Scourge the Great  Jehova  made  And into ruin'd Heaps our Edifices laid  You  South  and  West  the Tragedy began  As with disorder'd haste you o'er the Surface ran  Forgetting that you were

the Balance right  Nor yield increase of Sway to arbitrary Might  Meeting now they all contend  Those assail while These defend  Fierce and turbulent the War  And in the loud tumultuous Jar  Winds their own Fifes and Clarions are  Each Cavity which Art or Nature leaves  Their Inspiration hastily receives  Whence from their various Forms and Size  As various Symphonies arise  Their Trumpet ev'ry hollow Tube is made  And when more solid Bodies they invade  Enrag'd they can no farther come  The beaten Flatt whilst it repels the Noise  Resembles but with more outrageous Voice  The Soldier's threatning Drum  And when they compass thus our World around  When they our Rocks and Mountains rend  When they our Sacred Piles to their Foundations send  No wonder if our ecchoing Caves rebound  No wonder if our list'ning Sense they wound  When arm'd with so much Force and usher'd with such Sound  Nor scarce amidst the Terrors of that Night  When you fierce Winds such Desolations wrought  When you from out his Stores the Great Commander brought  Cou'd the most Righteous stand upright  Scarcely the Holiest Man performs  The Service that becomes it best  By ardent Vows or solemn Pray'rs addrest  Nor finds the Calm so usual to his Breast  Full Proof against such Storms  How shou'd the Guilty then be found  The Men in Wine or looser Pleasures drown'd  To six a stedfast Hope or to maintain their Ground  When at his Glass the late Companion feels  That Giddy like himself the tott'ring Mansion reels  The Miser who with many a Chest  His gloomy Tenement opprest  Now fears the overburthen'd Floor  And trembles for his Life but for his Treasure mo  What shall he do or to what Pow'rs apply  To those which threaten from on High  By him ne'er call'd upon before  Who also will suggest th' impossible Restore  No  Mammon  to thy Laws he will be true  And rather than his Wealth will bid the Wo  adie  The Rafters sink and bury'd with his Coin  That Fate does with his living Thoughts combine  For still his Heart's inclos'd within a Golden Mine  Contention with its angry Brawls  By Storms o'erclamour'd shrinks and fall  Nor WHIG nor TORY now the rash C  tender ca  Those who but Vanity allow'd  Nor thought it reach'd the Name of Sin  To be of their Perfections proud  Too much adorn'd without or too much rais'd within  Now find that even the lightest Things  As the minuter parts of Air  When Number to their Weight addition brings  Can like the small but numerous Insects Stings  Can like th' assembl'd Winds urge Ruin and Despair  Thus You've obey'd you Winds that must fulfill  The Great disposer's Righteous Will  Thus did your Breath a strict Enquiry make  Thus did you our most secret Sins awake  And thus chastis'd their Ill  Whilst vainly Those of a rapacious

their Choice as unadvis'd as They  The tim'rous  Deer  whilst he forsakes the Park  And wanders on in the misguiding Dark  Believes a Foe from ev'ry unknown Bush  Will on his trembling Body rush

unentail'd your undivided Air  Where no Proprietor was ever known  Where no litigious Suits have ever grown  Whilst none from Star to Star cou'd call the space his Own  When this no more your middle Flights can bear  But some rough Blast too far above conveighs  Or to unquitted Earth confines your weak Essays  Nor You nor wiser Man cou'd find Repose  Nor cou'd our Industry produce  Expedients of the smallest Use  To ward our greater Cares or mitigate your Woes  Ye  Clouds  that pity'd our Distress  And by your pacifying Showers  The soft and usual methods of Success  Kindly assay'd to make this Tempest less  Vainly your Aid was now alas employ'd  In vain you wept o'er those destructive Hours  In which the Winds full Tyranny enjoy'd  Nor wou'd allow you to prevail  But drove your scorn'd and scatter'd Tears to wail  The Land that lay destroy'd  Whilst You obey'd you Winds that must fulfill  The just Disposer's Righteous Will  Whilst not the Earth alone you disarray  But to more ruin'd Seas wing'd your impetuous Way  Which to foreshew the still portentous  Sun  Beamless and pale of late his Race begun  Quenching the Rays he had no Joy to keep  In the obscure and sadly threaten'd

 The Thorns which former Days had sown  To Crops of late Repentance grown  Thro' which we toil at last  Whilst ev'ry Care's a driving Harm  That helps to bear us down  Which faded Smiles no more can charm  But ev'ry Tear's a WinterStorm  And ev'ry Look's a Frown  Till with succeeding Ills opprest  For Joys we hop'd to find  By Age too rumpl'd and undrest  We gladly sinking down to rest  Leave following Crouds behind  HOPE  THE Tree of  Knowlege  we in  Eden  prov'd  The Tree of  Life  was thence to Heav  remov'd  Hope  is the growth of Earth the only Plant  Which either Heav'n or Paradice cou'd want  Hell knows it not to Us alone confin'd  And Cordial only to the Human Mind  Receive it then t'expel these mortal Cares  Nor wave a Med'cine which thy God prepares  Moral  SONG  WOuld we attain the happiest State  That is design'd us here  No Joy a Rapture must create  No Grief beget Despair  No Injury fierce Anger raise  No Honour tempt to Pride  No vain Desires of empty Praise  Must in the Soul abide  No Charms of Youth or Beauty move  The constant settl'd Breast  Who leaves a Passage free to Love  Shall let in all the rest  In such a Heart soft Peace will live  Where none of these abound  The greatest Blessing Heav'n do's give  Or can on Earth be found  GLASS  O Man what Inspiration was thy Guide  Who taught thee Light and Air thus to divide  To let in all the useful Beams of Day  Yet force as subtil Winds without thy Shash to stay  T' extract from Embers by a strange Device  Then polish fair these Flakes of solid Ice  Which silver'd o'er redouble all in place  And give thee back thy well or illcomplexion'd Face  To Vessels blown exceed the gloomy Bowl  Which did the Wine's full excellence controul  These shew the Body whilst you taste the Soul  Its Colour sparkles Motion lets thee see  Tho' yet th' Excess the Preacher warns to flee  Lest Men at length as clearly spy through Thee  The  DOG  and his  MASTER  NO better  Dog  e'er kept his Master's Door  Than honest  Snarl  who spar'd nor Rich nor Poor  But gave the Alarm when any one drew nigh  Nor let pretended Friends pass fearless by  For which reprov'd as better Fed than Taught  He rightly thus expostulates the Fault  To keep the House from Rascals was my Charge  The Task was great and the Commission large  Nor did your  Worship  e'er declare your Mind  That to the begging Crew it was confin'd  Who shrink an Arm or prop an able Knee  Or turn up Eyes till they're not seen nor see  To Thieves who know the Penalty of Stealth  And fairly stake their Necks against your Wealth  These are the known Delinquents of the Times  And Whips and  Tyburn  testify their Crimes  But since to Me there was by Nature lent  An exquisite Discerning by the Scent  I trace a Flatt'rer when he fawns and leers  A rallying Wit when he commends and jeers  The greedy Parasite I grudging note  Who praises the good Bits that oil his Throat  I mark the Lady you so fondly toast  That plays your Gold when all her own is lost  The Knave who fences your Estate by Law  Yet still reserves an undermining Flaw  These and a thousand more which I cou'd tell  Provoke my Growling and offend my Smell  The  PHOENIX  A  SONG  A Female Friend advis'd a Swain  Whose Heart she wish'd at ease  Make Love thy Pleasure not thy Pain  Nor let it deeply seize  Beauty where Vanities abound  No serious Passion claims  Then 'till a  Phoenix  can be found  Do not admit the Flames  But griev'd She finds that his Replies  Since prepossess'd when Young  Take all their Hints from  Silvia  's Eyes  None from  ARDELIA  's Tongue  Thus  Cupid  of our Aim we miss  Who wou'd unbend thy Bow  And each slight Nymph a  Phoenix  is  When Love will have it so  A  SONG  PErsuade me not there is a Grace  Proceeds from  Silvia  's Voice or Lute  Against  Miranda  's charming Face  To make her hold the least Dispute  Musick which tunes the Soul for Love  And stirs up all our soft Desires  Do's but the growing Flame improve  Which pow'rful Beauty first inspires  Thus whilst with Art she plays and sings  I to  Miranda  standing by  Impute the Musick of the Strings  And all the melting Words apply  JEALOUSY  A  SONG  VAIN Love why do'st thou boast of Wings  That cannot help thee to retire  When such quick Flames Suspicion brings  As do the Heart about thee fire  Still Swift to come but when to go  Thou shou'd'st be moreAlas how Slow  Lord of the World must surely be  But thy bare Title at the most  Since  Jealousy  is Lord of Thee  And makes such Havock on thy Coast  As do's thy pleasant Land deface  Yet binds thee faster to the Place  A  SONG  LOVE thou art best of Human Joys  Our chiefest Happiness below  All other Pleasures are but Toys  Musick without Thee is but Noise  And Beauty but an empty Show  Heav'n who knew best what Man wou'd move  And raise his Thoughts above the Brute  Said Let him Be and let him Love  That must alone his Soul improve  Howe'er Philosophers dispute  A  SONG  QUickly  Delia  Learn my Passion  Lose not Pleasure to be Proud  Courtship draws on Observation  And the Whispers of the Croud  Soon or late you'll hear a Lover  Nor by Time his Truth can prove  Ages won't a Heart discover  Trust and so secure my Love  A  SONG  'TIS strange this Heart within my breast  Reason opposing and her Pow'rs  Cannot one gentle Moment rest  Unless it knows what's done in Yours  In vain I ask it of your Eyes  Which subt'ly wou'd my Fears controul  For Art has taught them to disguise  Which Nature made t' explain the Soul  In vain that Sound your Voice affords  Flatters sometimes my easy Mind  But of too vast Extent are Words  In them the Jewel Truth to find  Then let my fond Enquiries cease  And so let all my Troubles end  For sure that Heart shall ne'er know Peace  Which on Anothers do's depend  To Mr  F  now Earl of  W  Who going abroad had desired  ARDELIA  to write some Verses upon whatever Subject she thought fit against his Return in the Evening  Written in the Year    NO sooner  FLAVIO  was you gone  But your Injunction thought upon  ARDELIA  took the Pen  Designing to perform the Task  Her  FLAVIO  did so kindly ask  Ere he returned agen  Unto  Parnassus  strait she sent  And bid the Messenger that went  Unto the  Muses  Court  Assure them she their Aid did need  And begg'd they'd use their utmost Speed  Because the Time was short  The hasty Summons was allow'd  And being wellbred they rose and bow'd  And said they'd poste away  That well they did  ARDELIA  know  And that no Female's Voice below  They sooner wou'd obey  That many of that rhiming Train  On like Occasions sought in vain  Their Industry t'excite  But for  ARDELIA  all they'd leave  Thus flatt'ring can the Muse deceive  And wheedle us to write  Yet since there was such haste requir'd  To know the Subject 'twas desir'd  On which they must infuse  That they might temper Words and Rules  And with their Counsel carry Tools  As Country  Doctors  use  Wherefore to cut off all Delays  'Twas soon reply'd a  Husband  's Praise  Tho' in these looser Times  ARDELIA  gladly wou'd rehearse  A  Husband  's who indulg'e her Verse  And now requir'd her Rimes  A  Husband  eccho'd all around  And to  Parnassus  sure that Sound  Had never yet been sent  Amazement in each Face was read  In haste th' affrighted Sisters  The Mus  s  Erato Melpomene Thalia Urania  c  fled  And unto Council went  Erato  cry'd since  Grizel  's Days  Since  Troy  Town pleas'd and  Chiveychace  No such Design was known  And 'twas their Bus'ness to take care  It reach'd not to the publick Ear  Or got about the Town  Nor came where Evening  Beaux  were met  O'er  Billetdoux  and  Chocolate  Lest it destroy'd the House  For in that Place who cou'd dispence  That wore his Cloaths with common Sense  With mention of a  Spouse  'Twas put unto the Vote at last  And in the Negative it past  None to her Aid shou'd move  Yet since  ARDELIA  was a Friend  Excuses 'twas agreed to send  Which plausible might prove  That  Pegasus  of late had been  So often rid thro' thick and thin  With neither Fear nor Wit  In  Panegyrick  been so spurr'd  He cou'd not from the Stall be stirr'd  Nor wou'd endure the Bit  Melpomene  had given a Bond  By the new House alone to stand  And write of War and Strife  Thalia  she had taken Fees  And Stipends from the Patentees  And durst not for her Life  Ʋrania  Urania  is the Heavenly Muse and suppos'd to inspire Thoughts of Vertue  only lik'd the Choice  Yet not to thwart the publick Voice  She whisp'ring did impart  They need no Foreign Aid invoke  No help to draw a moving Stroke  Who dictate from the Heart  Enough the pleas'd  ARDELIA  cry'd  And slighting ev'ry Muse beside  Consulting now her Breast  Perceiv'd that ev'ry tender Thought  Which from abroad she'd vainly sought  Did there in Silence rest  And shou'd unmov'd that Post maintain  Till in his quick Return again  Met in some neighb'ring Grove  Where Vice nor Vanity appear  Her  FLAVIO  them alone might hear  In all the Sounds of Love  For since the World do's so despise  Hymen  's Endearments and its Ties  They shou'd mysterious be  Till We that Pleasure too possess  Which makes their fancy'd Happiness  Of stollen Secrecy  A  LETTER  to the same Person  SUre of Success to You I boldly write  Whilst Love do's ev'ry tender Line endite  Love who is justly President of Verse  Which all his Servants write or else rehearse  Phoebus  howe'er mistaken Poets dream  Ne'er us'd a Verse till Love became his Theme  To his stray'd Son still as his Passion rose  He rais'd his hasty Voice in clam'rous Prose  But when in  Daphne  he wou'd Love inspire  He woo'd in Verse set to his silver Lyre  The  Trojan  Prince did pow'rful Numbers join  To sing of War but Love was the Design  And sleeping  Troy  again in Flames was drest  To light the Fires in pitying  Dido  's Breast  Love without Poetry's refining Aid  Is a dull Bargain and but coarsely made  Nor e'er cou'd Poetry successful prove  Or touch the Soul but when the Sense was Love  Oh cou'd they both in Absence now impart  Skill to my Hand but to describe my Heart  Then shou'd you see impatient of your Stay  Soft Hopes contend with Fears of sad Delay  Love in a thousand fond Endearments there  And lively Images of You appear  But since the Thoughts of a Poetick Mind  Will never be to Syllables confin'd  And whilst to fix what is conceiv'd we try  The purer Parts evaporate and dye  You must perform what they want force to do  And think what your  ARDELIA  thinks of you  October  FRAGMENT  SO here

Time  To vain Amusements dedicate her Prime  Ambition next allur'd her tow'ring Eye  For Paradice she heard was plac'd on high  Then thought the Court with all its glorious Show  Was sure above the

inevitable Round  With them thrown prostrate to the humble Ground  No more she takes instructed by that Fall  For fix'd or worth her thought this rolling Ball  Tow'rds a more certain Station she aspires  Unshaken by Revolts and owns no less Desires  But all in vain are Pray'rs extatick Thoughts  Recover'd Moments and retracted Faults  Retirement which the World  Moroseness  calls  Abandon'd

the Strings refuse  Nor will their Masters Griefs abuse  How can We Lord thy Praise proclaim  Here in a strange unhallow'd Land  Lest we provoke them to Blaspheme  A Name they do not understand  And with rent Garments that deplore  Above whate'er we felt before  But Thou  Jerusalem  so Dear  If thy lov'd Image e'er depart  Or I forget thy Suff'rings here  Let my right Hand forget her Art  My

set  An ancient Quarrel had such Hatred wrought  That for Revenge as for Renown they fought  Now bloody was the Day and hard the Strife  Wherein bold Warriors lost neglected Life  But as some Errors still we must commit  Nor Valour always ballanc'd is by Wit  Among the  Rats  some Officers appear'd  With lofty Plumage on their Foreheads rear'd  Unthinking they and ruin'd by their Pride  For when the  Weazels  prov'd the stronger Side  A gen'ral Rout befell and a Retreat  Was by the Vanquish'd now implor'd of Fate  To slender Crannies all repair'd in haste  Where easily the undress'd Vulgar past  But when the  Rats  of Figure wou'd have fled  So wide those branching Marks of Honour spread  The Feather in the Cap was fatal to the Head  Democritus  and his Neighbours  Imitated from  Fontaine  IN Vulgar Minds what Errors do arise  How diff'ring are the Notions they possess  From theirs whom better Sense do's bless  Who justly are enroll'd amongst the Learn'd and Wise  Democritus  whilst he all Science taught  Was by his foolish Neighbours thought  Distracted in his Wits  Who call his speculative Flights  His solitary Walks in starry Nights  But wild and frantick Fits  Bless me

Recipes and Med'cines full  To check the giddy Whirl of Nature's Fires  If so th' unruly Case requires  Or with his Cobwebcleansing Brooms  To sweep and clear the overcrouded Scull  If settl'd Spirits flag and make the Patient dull  But asking what the Symptoms were  That made 'em think he was so bad  The Man indeed they cry'd is wond'rous Ma  You at this Distance may behold him there  Beneath that Tree in open Air  Surrounded with the Engines of his Fate  The Gimcracks of a broken Pate  Those  Hoops  a Sphere he calls  That  Ball  the Earth  And when into his raving Fit he falls  'Twou'd move at once your Pity and your Mir  To hear him as you will do soon  Declaring there's a Kingdom in the Moon  And that each Star for ought he knows  May some Inhabitants enclose  Philosophers he says may there abound  Such Jugglers as himself be in them found  Which if there be the World may well turn round  At least to those whose Whimsies are so strange  That whilst they're fixt to one peculiar Place  Pretend to measure far extended Space  And 'mongst the Planets range  Behold him now contemplating that Head  From which longsince both Flesh and Brains are fled  Questioning if that empty hollow Bowl  Did not ere while contain the Human Soul  Then starts a Doubt if 'twere not to the Heart  That Nature rather did that Gift impart  Good Sir employ the utmost of your Skill  To make him Wiser tho' against his Will  Who thinks that he already All exceeds  And laughs at our most solemn Words and Deeds  Tho' once amongst us he wou'd try a Cause  And Bus'ness of the Town discuss  Knowing as well as one of us  The Price of Corn and standing MarketLaws  Wou'd bear an Office in his Turn  For which good Purposes all Men were born  Not to be making Circles in the Sand  And scaling Heav'n till they have sold their Land  Or when unstock'd below their Pasture lies  To find out Bulls and Rams amidst the Skies  From these Mistakes his Madness we conclude  And hearing you was with much Skill endu'd  Your Aid we sought  Hippocrates  amaz'd  Now on the Sage now on the Rabble gaz'd  And whilst he needless finds his artful Rules  Pities a Man of Sense judg'd by a Croud of Fools  Then

distant Cavern safe confin'd  And only gentle  Zephyr  fans his Wings  And lonely  Philomel  still waking sings  Or from some Tree fam'd for the  Owl  's delight  She hollowing clear directs the Wand'rer right  In such a  Night  when passing Clouds give place  Or thinly vail the Heav'ns mysterious Face  When in some River overhung with Green  The waving Moon and trembling Leaves are seen  When freshen'd Grass now bears it self upright  And makes cool Banks to pleasing Rest invite  Whence springs the  Woodbind  and the  Bramble  Rose  And where the sleepy  Cowslip  shelter'd grows  Whilst now a paler Hue the  Foxglove  takes  Yet checquers still with Red the dusky brakes  When scatter'd  Glowworms  but in Twilight fine  Shew trivial Beauties watch their Hour to shine  Whilst  Salisb'ry  stands the Test of every Light  In perfect Charms and perfect Virtue bright  When Odours which declin'd repelling Day  Thro' temp'rate Air uninterrupted stray  When darken'd Groves their softest Shadows wear  And falling Waters we distinctly hear  When thro' the Gloom more venerable shows  Some ancient Fabrick awful in Repose  While Sunburnt Hills their swarthy Looks conceal  And swelling Haycocks thicken up the Vale  When the loos'd  Horse  now as his Pasture leads  Comes slowly grazing thro' th' adjoining Meads  Whose stealing Pace and lengthen'd Shade we fear  Till torn up Forage in his Teeth we hear  When nibbling  Sheep  at large pursue their Food  And unmolested Kine rechew the Cud  When  Curlews  cry beneath the Villagewalls  And to her straggling Brood the  Partridge  calls  Their shortliv'd Jubilee the Creatures keep  Which but endures whilst Tyrant  Man  do's sleep  When a sedate Content the Spirit feels  And no fierce Light disturbs whilst it reveals  But silent Musings urge the Mind to seek  Something too high for Syllables to speak  Till the free Soul to a compos'dness charm'd  Finding the Elements of Rage disarm'd  O'er all below a solemn Quiet

Lacedemonians  Enter  Climander  meeting  Arcasius  both drest like Shepherds  Clim  HAst thou provided me a Horse and Arms  A Sword  Arcasius  that when Time has freed me  From the severe Injunctions of a Father  May fill my Hand instead of this vile Hook  And fit it for the Work a Prince is born to  Arca  Unwillingly I have obey'd your Orders  But 'till tomorrow's and the next day's Sun  Shall light the angry and contentious World  Your Promise to your Father is in Force  As well as the assurance which you gave  That in my Custody these Arms shou'd rest  Until that fatal Time demands their Use  Clim  Call it not Fatal Oh that 'twere arriv'd  That  Aristomenes  the  Spartan  Terrour  Were leading me this moment bravely on  Through Dangers equal to the Cause he fights for  Preserving these free Plains from foreign Bondage  Though in the Strife this Body strew'd the Ground  To Fame and Publick Good an early Victim  Arca  O wretched  Rhodes  Thy Ruin is pronounc'd  And thou beneath th'impending Plagues may'st perish  Since He whom Oracles appoint to Aid thee  Thus wishes with his Own to sell Thy Safety  For the rash Praise of an intruding Warriour  Clim  No more of Oracles  Which oftner we fulfil by heedless Chance  Than the vain Study to pursue their Meaning  Which makes me banish from my lab'ring Thoughts  Those Mystick Words which serve but to perplex them  Arc  From Mine they will not part nor shou'd from Yours  Which to prevent ev'n now I will repeat them  The Isle of  Rhodes  shall be  of Peace  bereft  Unless it by the Heir thereof be left  And that He wed ere he returns agen  The Beauteous Daughter of the Best of Men  Whose Father's presence there shall save the State  And smooth the threatning Brow of angry Fate  Clim  But Who this Man or Where his Daughter is  Was left in Darkness to employ our Search  Yet in Obedience Hither did I come  To feed a Flock and mix with simple Swains  Because the Priests who sway in Princes Courts  Declar'd that perfect Innocence and Virtue  Was to be found but in their lowly Rank  And There the Best of Men was to be sought for  Arc  'Tis True they did and therefore urg'd our Prince  That stighting in a Case of such Importance  The Pride of Titles and of equal Birth  You might espouse One of these Rural Maids  Whose Parents harmless Presence in our Land  Might bring the Blessings of the Gods upon us  And lest the Wars which still infest these Countries  Shou'd tempt you from the Fates and his Design  How strictly did He Charge it on your Duty  That 'till the Time which now Two Days must end  You shou'd not leave these Plains to seek the Camp  Clim  Nor have I done it as Thyself can witness  But here have spent the long and lazy Hours  Carelesly stretch'd beneath some  Sylvan  Shade  And only sent my Wishes to their Tents  But ere the Battle which is soon intended  Shall meet in glorious Tryal of their Right  I will be there and side with the  Messenians  Arc  Oh that you wou'd not  That first your Native Country might be serv'd  Think on her Danger and your Sovereign's Will  'Twas to the Reed and not the wrangling Trumpet  He bid you listen to secure his Peace  Nor have you look'd with Love as he requir'd  On any Shepherdess tho' ne'er so Fair  Or born of Parents harmless as their Flocks  Low on my Knees my Lord let me prevail  He Kneels  That when the Time decreed you do's expire  You will not prosecute this rash Design  But go with me yet farther on these Plains  And seek to please your Father and the Gods  In such safe humble ways as they direct us  Clim  Nay prithee do not kneel it grates my Nature  Raises him  But trust me when we have subdued these Countries  When  Lacedemon  's Kings shall sue for Peace  And make great  Aristomenes  Returns  Agreeing to his Merits and their Wrongs  And I have gain'd such Honour as becomes me  Whate'er thou dost request shall be observ'd  And tho' my Soul finds such vast disproportion  Betwixt the Thoughts with which she is inspir'd  And those that lodge in these poor Country Maids  Yet shall my Duty o'er my Temper rise  I'll trust like Others only to my Eyes  And think that Women in Perfection are  Tho ne'er so Ignorant if Young and Fair  Arc  Ha  A Noise is heard of distant Drums  Sure I hear the distant Sound of Drums  Aside  Heav'n grant what I've been told and kept so secret  Of a Design this Day to end the War  Be not a Truth too tempting for my Reasons  Enter frighted  Theata  and  Lamia  Shepherdesses  Thea  Oh may we here be safe tell us  Climander  For all the Lawns that lie beyond the Hill  Where still our Flocks were us'd to feed in peace  Are fill'd with War and dark with flying Arrows  The Sheep disperse whilst none regard their Safety  But call on  Pan  to shield th'advent'rous Chief  The noble  Aristomenes  from Danger  Clim  Hear me  Arcasius  hear and do not thwart me  Aside to  Arc  Nor tye me to a few remaining Hours  For by the horrid Shield that bears the  Gorgon  I Swear if thou refuse to arm me now  With what I sent thee lately to provide  These Feet shall bear me sandal'd to the Battle  This flow'ry Wreath shall mix with their stern Helmets  And Death I'll take if not impower'd to give it  Arc  Oh do not ask my Aid but in this Tryal  Call all your fainting Virtue to assist  And help you keep your Promise to your Father  Clim  I did not Promise him to be a Coward  To let the Sound of War thus strike my Sense  Yet keep my Heart in a cool even Temper  Hark this way comes the Noise and I will meet it  As he is going a confus'd Noise and Cry is heard within  Arc  They're Cries of Grief and not the Shouts of Battle  I hope All's past lest He and  Rhodes  shou'd perish  Enter meeting  Climander Clinias  and other Shepherds  st Shep  Ruin'd Undone  Clin  Let every Shepherd weep  Turn their sweet Harmony to Sighs and Groans  To the fierce Wolves deliver up their Flocks  And leave  Messenia  to the cruel Victor  Clim  The Victor  Clinias  is the Fight then over  Clin  It is and We again the Slaves of  Sparta  Clim  Then  Aristomenes  must sure be breathless  And if he's Dead fall'n in his Country's Cause  The Gods have giv'n Him Fame whilst We are Wretched  Clin  Oh He's not Dead but Living in their Power  Which 'tis believ'd they'll use with utmost Rigour  Pressing too far on the Auxiliary Troops  The Foe surrounding bore him from his Horse  Then with the Thongs of their curs'd  Cretan  Bows  Bound his strong Arms and lead him off in Triumph  Clim  Convert ye Powers to Blood and Tears that Triumph  Rescue from their vile Hands the noble Prey  And send him warmer Friends than  Demagetus  Aside  Who knowing not his Person lov'd his Valour  O illtim'd Duty how hast thou betray'd me  Where is  Aristor  Where's the brave  Alcander  To them  Clin  The first may share in his great Father's Fate  For ought as yet the Army can discover  Alcander  heads but cannot lead them on  And 'tis believ'd they quickly will forsake him  Such cold Dismay and Terrour has possess'd 'em  Yet ere we part forever part from hence  If so the cruel Tyrant shou'd Decree  Let us appoint one sad and solemn Meeting  Where all the Ensigns of our former

more with chearful Feet  Exeunt Shepherds and Shepherdesses  Clim  Cruel  Arcasius  How hast thou und one me  Charming me with thy Tears to this soft Circle  Whilst the bright Spirit Honour is gone by  And borne away on neverturning Pinions  Why wou'd'st thou thus contrive against my Fame  And rob my fiery Youth of this first War  For which it languish'd with a Lover's Fondness  By saying still

Which if you slight shall of the Gods implore  A hasty Death to fall on old  Arcasius  Nor think this Posture means to cross your way  For by those Powers I swear if they will Fight  As much we hear 'tis doubted by the Shepherds  I will not sue to keep you from the Army  Or bring on me your future Life's Reproaches  Let me obtain but This for all my Service  To be first sent to sound their

Bar  To Safety Madam poor and humble Safety  Which in those Hamlets now within our Sight  The Shepherds find with whom we may partake it  Herm  Thus far indeed thou'st brought me on to seek it  Urging the Danger of a Virgin's Honour  When left defenceless to the Conqueror's Will  But dost thou think we may not thro' these Woods  Find out some gloomy Cave to Men unknown  And there expiring sleep secure for ever  Bar  Why shou'd we Dye  Since  Aristomenes  may yet be Living  Herm  Oh that thou had'st not nam'd him  She starts and weeps  'Till we were lodg'd where Grief  Might have its Course

What must I do indeed I will observe thee  Bar  Then not far hence conceal'd within this Grove  Wait my Return who must go find the Shepherds  And frame some Story that when you appear  Thro' no

Rabble crouding and following him with confus'd Cries and Shouts Exeunt  The  SCENE  changed discovers a CouncilChamber in  Anaxander  's Palace  Anaxander Clarinthus  and several Lords of  Sparta  Anax  Most happily my Lords we now are met  To see those Hands in servile Fetters ty'd  Which broke the Bondage of the proud  Messenians  Whom  Sparta  long had held in hard Subjection  Ere yet their Captive General do's appear  Be it amongst your selves My Lords resolved  What Course will answer best our Ends upon them  Speak you  Clarinthus  for'most of the Assembly  And then let ev'ry one add what he pleases  Clar  Short be my Speech and plain as is the way  Which must secure what  Lacedemon  toils for  Let him resign that Country kept by him  From the entire Subjection to our Yoke  Or let his speedy Death deliver to Us  What his too active Life has long kept back  Anax  What say the rest  All the Sen  All all agree to this  Clar  No middle Course can be of use to  Sparta  Anax  It is enough Call for the Prisoner there  A Lord  Bring in the Pris'ner 'tis the King's Command  Aristomenes  is brought in by the Guard  Aristor  in a  Spartan  Dress presses in amongst the Croud whilst  Phila  appears at the Door  Anax  At last we see the Hero can be Conquer'd  To  Clar  Clar  Not in his Looks for they are haughty still  And so his Mind will prove if I mistake not  Anax  That you our Pris'ner now of late our Foe  Have urg'd that Country where you rule in Chief  To break our Yoke and make Incursions on us  Since known to all will justify our Sentence  Which is That you shall meet the Death deserv'd  Unless to keep our Quiet for the future  You bring again  Messenia  to our Sway  Paying such Tribute as shall be impos'd  By Us the Lords of that offensive State  This is the Choice we kindly set before you  And wish that you wou'd take the safest Part  Aristom  Enslave my Country to secure my Life  That Pow'r forbid it under whose Protection  I've often fought her Battles with Success  And drove th' illgrounded War home to your  Sparta  Clar  He braves us in his Bond then you wou'd Dye  Aristom  I do not say I wou'd  I am a Man and Nature bars that saying  Yet I dare Dye no  Spartan  here but knows it  But since the Fates whose Wills we best can read  When thus unfolded in their dire Events  Tell me by these vile Bonds I must submit  Propose the gentlest Bargain you can make  And if I find my Life bears equal Weight  I am content to take it else 'tis Yours  Anax  'Tis not for Us to wave or change our Terms  Mistaken Men who think not of our Power  And that we may command what we propose  Since the first Sally now must take Possession  Of what your frighted Rout will soon abandon  Aristom  My frighted Rout  Ye basely wrong with foul reproachful Names  Those valiant Troops which yet ye cannot Conquer  For know thou proud insulting  Anaxander  There's at their Head a resolute young Man  That will not 'bate thee in his strict Account  One Sigh or Groan thy Tortures or thy Dungeons  Shall wrest in Dying from his Father's Bosom  Anaxander  and the Senate talk among themselves whilst  Aristor  comes forward upon the Stage  But there he stands  Aside seeing  Aristor  Aristor  thro' that  Spartan  Dress I view  And ne'er till now wish'd not to see my Son  Protect him from their Knowledge some kind Pow'r  If Youth or Virtue e'er engag'd your Pity  Clar  Let it be so and speedily perform'd  Aloud  For He'll ne'er yield to what has been demanded  Anax  You nam'd the Dungeon with a Threaten too  Of swift Revenge thinking to fright our Justice  But we'll take care first to perform our Part  Then venture what your daring Son can offer  The Dungeon is his Sentence thither bear him  Aristor  Not till this Hand has done a swifter Justice  Draws and runs at  Anax  Anax  Ha what means this my Guards  He avoids the thrust  Phila  runs in  Phila  Help Soldiers help seize that distracted  Spartan  Who now has got a Sword Disarm and take him  They disarm him  Aristor  'Tis false stand off ye Slaves and know I am  Phila  Oh stop his Mouth for if he raves he Dyes  They stop his Mouth with a Handkerchief  Aristom  As sure as now he Lives had he spoke more  Aside  Therefore be blest the Stratagem that stopt him  Anax  What means this  Phila  speak Who is this Madman  Phila  One by a Friend entrusted to my Care  Sent from the Country here to find a Cure  But hearing as the Croud pass'd by his Lodgings  That  Aristomenes  wou'd soon be Sentenc'd  He broke his Ward and fancy'd He must save him  I have pursu'd him 'till I'm faint with Crying  And am confounded at his frantick Passion  Oh Royal Sir forgive it  Anax  We do and pity him remove him hence  Then to thy Mistress my dear Daughter Go  And say we now again shall soon see  Sparta  Phila  I shall my Lord  Now follow me I'll lead ye to his Lodgings  To the Guards  Exit  Phila  with the Guards bearing off  Aristor  Aristom  Whoe'er she be  May Heaven reward her if she means his Safety  Aside  Now I can meditate on my own Fortunes  And slight the worst can reach me  Anax  He's deep in Thought which may produce a Change  Again I'll try him  To  Clar  Now  Aristomenes  that this wild Chance  Has given you time to think upon our Sentence  Have you enough consider'd of it's Horror  To bend your stubborn Will to our Demands  Aristom  Yes  Anaxander  I have weigh'd it well  That active Faculty which we call  Phancy  Soon as you spoke dragg'd me thus bound by Slaves  Thro' the throng'd Streets exciting several Passions  The Barb'rous Croud shouted their clamorous Joy  Because unpunish'd they might sport with Blood  Old Men and Matrons destin'd long for Death  With envious Pleasure saw me forc'd before them  To tread that Path in spight of vigorous Nature  Whilst tender Virgins turn'd aside their Heads  And dropt in Silence the soft Tears of Pity  But Oh the Soldiers from the Soldier's hands  Methoughts I saw their Swords neglected thrown  When Fortune shew'd they cou'd not save the Bravest  If once she frown'd from such a Fate as mine  Clar  He'll move the Croud urge him to speak directly  Anax  All this is from the purpose plainly tell  Whether you'll meet our Mercy or the Dungeon  Aristom  My Train of Thoughts to that dark Cave had led me  I stood reclin'd upon the horrid Brim  And gaz'd into it 'till my baffl'd Sight  Piercing beyond the many jetting Rocks  That help to break by turns the falling Body  Was lost in Shades where it must rest forever  And ready now to be push'd rudely off  This was my last and best Reflection on it  That there dwelt Peace which is not to be found  In his dark Bosom that has sold his Country  Anax  Away with him to instant Tryal of it  See this obey'd and plunge him headlong down  There he'll have Time if Life for such fine Thoughts  Away and bring me word it is perform'd  Exeunt  Anax  and Lords  Aristomenes  born off  Rabble and Sold  Away away the Dungeon the Dungeon  Peace and Prosperity to  Lacedemon  Exeunt  ACT II SCENE I  A Room in the Palace  Aristor  alone  Arist  I've torn with Cries the Roof of this vile Mansion  And from that Window barr'd too closely up  To give me leave to leap upon their Heads  Have curs'd the Croud and told'em whose I am  At which they laugh and cry 'tis  Phila  's Madman  He attempts but cannot force the Door  Confusion that she dares confine me thus  Whilst my free Thoughts unfollow'd by my Hand  Must see that cursed Deed they can't prevent  Oh  Aristomenes  my noble Father  Hear me ye Fates and let me but Revenge him  Give me Revenge and now methinks I grasp it  Broke thro' his Guards I seize upon the Tyrant  And stab him thus and thus  He acts all this  Then bear him to the Ground thus falling on him  And to his Heart thus tearing my wide way  Oh O' O' O'  Throws himself upon the Ground  Enter  Amalintha  the Door by one without immediately lock'd after her  Amal  Where is this wretched Mourner  Oh let me find him tho' to raise his Sorrows  With the sad Sound of my repeated Groans  Ha on the Ground then be it too my Seat  Sits on the Ground by him  For I will share in this Excess of Grief  As well as in the Days of milder Fortune  I bore a part in Love that knew no Measure  O  Aristomenes  oh my  Aristor  She puts her Handkerchief before her Eyes weeping  Aristor  Whoe'er thou art repeat again that Sound  Such Groans shall hourly issue from his Dungeon  And fright the bloody  Spartans  into Madness  He looks up  Ha sure I shou'd know that Form that Shape those Limbs  That lab'ring Bosom and those Locks disshevel'd  But take not from thy Face that friendly Cloud  Do not expose it lest thro' all it's Charms  My deep Revenge find out whose Stamp it bears  And urge me on to something Dark and Fatal  Amal  This from  Aristor  this to  Amalintha  She rises and shews her Face  Aristor  Why wou'd'st thou tempt me thus advent'rous Maid  And bring the Blood of  Anaxander  near me  Coming up fiercely to her  Canst thou too sondly think that Love's soft Bands  His gentle Cords of Hyacinths and Roses  Wovein the dewy Spring when Storms are silent  Can tye these Ilands provok'd by horrid Murther  Oh do not trust it  But fly this Ground while I have Power to bid thee  Amal  Aristor  no my Flight shall not preserve me  The Life I've kept but to indulge your Love  Now to this loud mistaken Rage I offer  Take it Oh take it Means cannot be wanting  Altho' no Instrument of Death be near you  This Hair these slatter'd Locks these oncelov'd Tresses  Round my sad Neck thus knit will soon perform it  Or on these trembling Lips your Hand but prest  Will send the rising Breath down to my Heart  And break it telling who deny'd it Passage  Aristor  Tryal beyond the Strength of Man and Lover  Amal  Or if you wou'd be quicker in Dispatch  Speak but a few such Words as now you utter'd  And my poor hov'ring Soul will fly before 'em  Farewel  Aristor  see the Work is done  I did but think I heard their killing Sound  And the bare Fancy saves you farther Study  She faints he catches her in his Arms  Aristor  Oh stop the glorious Fugitive a moment  And I will whisper to it such Repentance  Such Love such Fondness such unheardof Passion  As shall confine it to it's beauteous Mansion  Thus let me hug and press thee into Life  And lend thee Motion from my beating Heart  To set again the Springs of thine in working  Amal  I hear your Summons and my Life returns  But tell me ere again so firm 'tis fixt  That it must cost an Agony like this  To let it out to Liberty and Ease  Will you not hate me for my Father's Guilt  Aristor  By the soft Fires of Love that fill my Breast  And dart through all the Horrors of my Soul  Like Heaven's bright Flashes in a Night of Shadows  I will not hate or e'er reproach thee more  Yet let me breathe so gently one Complaint  So gently that it may not break thy Peace  Tho' it for ever has discarded mine  And ask why you thus cruelly wou'd use me  Why have me seiz'd and bound with frantick Fetters  Snatch'd from my Duty by a Woman's wile  And here confin'd whilst my great Father perish'd  Amal  'Twas none of mine by your dear self I swear  It was the Fates design and  Phila  's action  She saw you thus disguis'd amongst the Croud  And ere she would acquaint me with you Danger  Follow'd to watch the means how to prevent it  Aristor  I will believe you to my Heart's relief  Which must have broke had your Consent beer with her  But  Amalintha  now my Rage is gone  And Love thro' this mistake has forc'd his way  It spreads before my Thoughts the gaudy Scene  Of those Delights which have been once allow'd it  Brings to my Phancy in their softest Dress  The gentle Hours that told our private Meetings  Shews me the Grove where by the Moon's pale Light  We've breathd out tender Sighs 'till coming Day  Has drawn them deeper warning us to part  Which ne'er we did 'till some new Time was set  For the return of those transporting Pleasures  Amal  And so again  Aristor  we'll contrive  And so again we'll meet and sigh and love  Aristor  Oh O' O'  Amalintha  Amal  Oh why that Groan that deep that deathlike Groan  Aristor  When Soul and Body part it can't be softer  And I must leave thee Soul to sad  Aristor  With all those Pleasures which I but repeated  As Dying Friends will catch one last Embrace  Of what they know they must forego forever  Amal  Indeed you've call'd my wand'ring Fancy back  From those Delights where 'twou'd have endless stray'd  But my  Aristor  for I'll call you mine  Though all the Stars combine against my Title  And bar fulfilling of the Vows they've witness'd  Tell me tho' we must ne'er in Nuptials join  May we not meet and at this distance sigh  And when I've hoarded up a Stock of Tears  Which in the  Spartan  's sight I dare not lavish  Oh tell me if I may not seek you out  And in large Showers thus pour them down before you  She weeps  Arictor  Cease to oppress me more thou weeping Beauty  And think with what vast Storms my Soul is toss'd  Comes up to hear earnestly  Think too that but to gaze upon thee thus  To stand in reach of thy Ambrosial Breath  And hear thy Voice sweet as the Ev'ning Notes  When in still Shades the Shepherds sooth their Loves  I wou'd not mind an Army in my way  Or stop at raging Seas or brazen Towers  Yet  Amalintha  tho' I Dye to speak it  Yet we must part we must my  Amalintha  Amal  Never to meet agen Tell me but that  Aristor  Alas not I the Fates can only tell it  Let them make even one Account betwixt us  And give this Hand the Liberty to seal it  And we'll in spight of vengeful Thunder join  If then thy Heart be as resolv'd as mine  Amal  No on those Terms you mean we must not meet  But since those Fates deny it to your Power  The Will I to your mighty Wrongs forgive  From without the Door  Phila  Madam you'll be surpriz'd haste to return  Your Father's now just going to your Lodgings  Aristor  All Plagues and Curses meet him  Aside  Amal  Oh then I must be gone  A little time will call the State to Council  And when the Croud by that is thither drawn  One I will send to wait on your Escape  And if you tempt new Dangers know  Aristor  That  Amalintha  too will perish in them  Aristor  Fear not my Love  Phila  Haste Madam haste or we are all Undone  From without  Amal  So from his few short Moments calls away  A gasping Wretch the cruel Bird of Prey  Bids him make haste th' Eternal Shades to find  And leave like me all that is Dear behind  Aristor  Whilst like the Friend that's sadly weeping by  I see the much lov'd Spirit from me fly  And with vain Cries pursue it to that Coast  Where it must land and my weak Hopes be lost  He leads her to the Door and returns speaking as he's going out at the Other  Now let Revenge a while sustain my Heart  And Fate yet close my Life with some exalted Part  Exit  The Stage darken'd represents the Inside of a Dungeon  Aristomenes  lying down in it and struggling as coming out of a Swoon  Aristom  At last 'tis vanquish'd and my soaring Spirits  Dispel the gloomy Vapours that oppress'd them  And cloath'd my Dreams with more than mortal Horrour  So low in my deep Phancy was I plung'd  That o'er my Head impetuous Rivers rush'd  And Mountains grew betwixt our World and me  Hungry and Cold methought I wander'd on  Thro' fruitless Plains that Food nor Comfort nourish'd  'Till hideous Serpents twisted me about  And drew me to their Den all foul and loathsome  But I will quit the Bed that breeds such Visions  And summon all my Officers to Council  For with tomorrow's Dawn we'll storm  Phaerea  He walks about feeling for the Door  Ha where's the Door my Tent is sure transform'd  And all I touch is Rock that streams with Dew  Oh that I'd slept that I had slept for ever  He starts  Yes  Anaxander  yes thou worst of Furies  I know thy Dungeon now and my dark Ruin  Yet why ye Fates since fall'n below your Succour  Wou'd ye thus cruelly restore my Senses  To make me count my Woes by tedious Moments  Dye o'er again choak'd by unwholsome Damps  Parch'd up with Thirst or clung with pining Hunger  Borne piecemeal to the Holes of lurking Adders  Or mould'ring to this Earth where thus I cast me  Throws

Entrails  Or with low Winds thus fill her tuneful Pores  Oh that some Words of horrid Sense wou'd join it  To tell me where I might conclude my Sorrows  A Voice within Sings  st Voice  Fallen Wretch

Voice Sings again  st Voice  A pointed Rock with little pains  Will split the Circle of thy Brains  To thy Freedom I persuade thee  To a wat'ry Pit will lead thee  Which has no glorious Sunbeam seen  No Footsteep known or bord'ring Green  For thousand rolling Ages past  Fallen Wretch to this make haste  To this last Asylum fly  Fallen Wretch make haste and Dye  Aristom  I come thou kind Provoker of Despair  Which still is nearest Cure when at the Highest  I come I come  Going towards the Voice another Sings at the other side upon which He stops and listens  d Voice  Stay oh stay 'tis all Delusion  And wou'd breed thee more Confusion  I thy better Genius move thee  I that guard and I that love thee  I who in thy rocky way  Cloth'd in Eagles Feathers lay  And in safety brought thee down  Where none living e'er was known  Chearful Hope I bring thee now  Chearful Hope the Gods allow  Mortal on their Pleasures wait  Nor rush into the Arms of Fate  The Voice ceases  Aristom  To hope is still the Temper of the Brave  And tho' a just Despair had dispossess'd it  Yet thus encourag'd will I trust the Gods  With those few Moments Nature has to spare me  Nor follow thee thou bad persuading Spirit  Yet tell me who thou art and why thou tempt'st me  st Voice  I thy evil Genius am  To  Phaerea  with thee came  Hung o'er thee in the murd'ring Croud  And clapp'd my dusky Wings

this Threat was vain malicious Fury  st Voice  Now away away I fly  For hated Good is rushing by  Here the Voice ceases quite  A Machine like a  Fox  runs about the Dungeon smelling and rushes against  Aristomenes  who taking it for his evil Genius catches at it and speaks  Aristom  What hast thou Substance too and dar'st assault me  Nay then thou shalt not 'scape I'll seize and grapple with thee  And by my conqu'ring Arm o'ercome thy Influence  Fool that I was to think it cou'd be vanquisht  This is some rav'ning Beast the Fur betrays it  A  Fox  I think teach me to be as subtle  Extremity  thou Mother of Invention  He catches it  I have it now and where it leads will follow  My better Genius do's this Hour preside  Be strong that Influence and thou my Guide  Exit led out by the  Fox  The  SCENE  changes to the Plains by the Woodside  Enter from the Wood  Herminia  alone and faint  Herm  Here 'twas she left me but so far I've stray'd  Unheeding every thing but my sad Thoughts  That my faint Limbs no longer can support me  Oh let me rest and if 'tis Death I feel  A Guest more welcome none yet entertain'd  She sits down leaning against a Tree  Enter  Climander  looking towards the Camp as expecting the return of  Arcasius  Clim  He has exceeded much the time prefixt  And yet I wou'd not doubt him  I've climb'd the Hill better to view the Camp  And all are fixt and motionless as Death  Therefore a while I will command my Patience  He cannot now be long  He turns and sees  Herm  and gazes earnestly on her  Ha Who lies there  A lovely Shepherdess but faint she seems  Say beauteous Maid if so much Strength is left  How best a Stranger may assist or serve you  He kneels down by her  She do's not speak but looks into my Heart  And melts it to the softness of her Eyes  Hard by a Spring clear as the Tears she drops  Runs bubbling under a delicious Shade  Water thence fetch'd in a Pomegranate's rind  May call her fainting Spirits to their office  He goes out  Herm  He's gone but quickly will return again  Yet he's so gentle sure I need not fear him  Tho' at his first approach my Heart beat high  Till  Halcyon  sounds and words of Pity calm'd it  Nay something courtly in them was imply'd  And if the Swains are polish'd all like him  Their humble Sheds may scorn our ruder Greatness  Enter again  Climander  with Water in a PomgranateShell  Clim  Pan  if thou e'er did'st hear a Shepherd's Prayer  Endue this Water sacred to thy Name  With all the Vertues needful to restore her  She drinks  Herm  Your Pray'r is heard kind Shepherd take my Thanks  And He whom you invok'd reward you largely  Clim  Oh You may far outdo all He can grant  In but declaring where you feed your Flocks  And to what Shade when  Phoebus  hottest shines  You lead those happy Sheep to 'scape his Fury  That I exposing mine to the wide Plains  May seek you out and sigh till Night before you  Herm  Alas I have no Flocks or Skill to guide them  No leafy Hamlet strew'd with painted Flowers  Or mossy Pillow to repose my Head  But wander from a distant fatal Place  Where I have lost my Parents and my Succour  And now in such a Habit as becomes it  Seek the low Plains to learn the Art you practise  Clim  She may be Noble then and for her Form  'Tis sure the fairest that my Eyes e'er fix'd on  Aside  Who were your Parents gentle Maid declare  Herm  They were not mean and yet I must conceal them  My Mother early Dy'd but Fame has told me  She'd all Perfections which make other Proud  Yet wore them as she knew not they adorn'd her  And be in this my Father's Praise exprest  That by an Oracle He was confest  Of all the Race of Men to be the Best  Clim  The Best of Men and you the Fairest Woman  And in a Moment I the greatest Lover  He speaks this transportedly and seizes her Hand which he kisses  Whilst to complete my Bliss by Heav'ns decree  These Beauties all are mine and thus I claim them  Herm  Protect me all ye Powers that wait on Virtue  From the dark Ends of such unruly Transports  She takes her Hand away hastily and rises  Nor dare presumptuous Swain once to renew them  Or tempt more Dangers than a Crook can answer  Clim  A Man there lives not shou'd have urg'd that to me  Built round with Steel or plung'd all o'er in  Styx  Then let your Beauty's Triumphs be complete  Which after such a Threat can bend my Knee  And make me sue for Pardon as for Life  Herm  I can forgive whilst I forbid such Language  Since She who yields to have her Beauty worshipp'd  Must pay too much to him that brings the Incense  Clim  To Me you cannot 'tis a Debt to Fate  Your Heart is mine the amorous Stars ordain it  Which smiling hung o'er my auspicious Birth  And not an angry Planet cross'd their Influence  They bid me Love and the Harmonious God  When askt what Path shou'd lead me on to Glory  Sent forth a Sound that charm'd the hoary Priest  And said a Passion soft as that must bless me  Then do not strive to disappoint their Purpose  Or quench Celestial Flames with Scorn or Coldness  Oh that a Smile might tell me that you wou'd not  A gentle Word a Look a Sigh confirm it  Or any sign that bears the stamp of Love  But 'tis in vain and some more happy Youth  Has drawn my Lot and mock'd foretelling  Phabus  Herm  I must not leave you with a Thought that wrongs me  For know no Passion e'er possess'd this Breast  Nor will the mighty Griefs that now have seiz'd it  E'er yield to give a softer Guest admittance  But my Companion comes Shepherd farewell  When next we meet if Heav'n that Moment sends  For your Assistance lent we may be Friends  Clim  Heav'n can't be true if it no more affords  Nor Oracles explain themselves by Words  Let talking Age the Joys of Friendship prove  Beauty for Youth was made and Youth alone for Love  Exeunt severally  ACT III SCENE I  A MyrtleGrove with a Fountain belonging to  Anaxander's  Palace  Enter  Amalintha  and  Phila  Amal  WHY had not I a barb'rous  Spartan  Soul  Unapt for Love and harsh as our rude Customs  Or why ye cruel Fates did you deny  My Birth to be among the neighb'ring Swains  Where on the flow'ry Banks of smooth  Panisus  I might have fat and heard the gentle Vows  Of some protesting Shepherd uncontroul'd  Phila  'Twas on those fatal Plains I well remember  That first your Eyes encounter'd with  Aristor  's  Amal  Yes in a Chace we met when Truce allow'd it  Where the young Prince whom I too much had mark'd  Thro' all the graceful Toils of that blest Day  Redeem'd my Life with Hazard of his own  From the chaf'd Boar that now had almost seiz'd me  Phila  When I arriv'd the first of all your Train  I heard you thank him for the gen'rous Rescue  Amal  I did yes  Phila  with my Heart I thank'd him  And paid it down a Ransom for my Life  Since when how often in this Place we've met  And with what Pleasure thou alone can'st tell  The only Friend and witness of our Passion  But prithee go and keep off all Intruders  Exit  Phila  Whilst with my Sorrows now I tread this Grove  Which shou'd not thrive when all our Hopes are blasted  She walks into the Grove  From the other Door the  Fox  runs over the Stage follow'd soon after by  Aristomenes  his Hands foul with Earth  Aristom  Farewell my wild Companion and my Leader  Pointing to the  Fox  Henceforth thy figure in my Ensigns borne  Shall tell the World if e'er I 'scape these Walls  That 'twas thy Conduct drew me from my Bondage  How fair this Grove appears to my loath'd Dungeon  He sees the Fountain  Oh welcome to my Sight thou gentle Spring  Ne'er did'st thou cool a Thirst that rag'd like mine  I bow my Knees upon thy mossy Brim  He kneels and lays his Mouth to the Stream  And as they drank ere Art had worsted Nature  Draw thy refreshing Stream to my scorch'd Entrails  Drinks agen  Again O Nectar most delicious  This favour more and then I quit thy Borders  Washes the Earth off his Hands and rises  Reenter  Amalintha  Amal  Oh 'tis all dismal now that Love is absent  Faded the Flow'rs and with'ring ev'ry Branch  Whilst thro' the Leaves the sad and sighing Winds  Methinks all say the Hours of Bliss are past  And here we ne'er shall meet each other more    Aristom  comes towards her  Ha what Intruder do my Eyes behold  A Stranger and invade my private Walks  The Doors too all secur'd Tell how you came  Aristom  As comes the Mole by painful working upwards  Will the sweet Air beat on my clammy Brows  Amal  There's something mystical in what you utter  Which tho' offended with your Presence here  wou'd be glad farther to have Unriddl'd  Draws her Dagger  This be my Guard and now you may proceed  And if you dare discover who you are  Aristom  I'd not deny my Name to 'scape that Dungeon  Pointing behind the Scenes  om whence these Hands have dug my way to Light  Tis  Aristomenes  that stands before you  Amal  O blest and strange Surprize  Aside  Aristom  Now if you have a Soul for noble Deeds  'tis reported of you  Spartan  Ladies  my Escape your Fame shall rise so high  hat ne'er an ancient Heroes shall outsoar it  f not I know the Place from whence I came  d 'twill be told with more uncommon Things  hich shall make up the Story of my Fortunes  hat I alone liv'd to be there twice Bury'd  She looks about  Nay look not round for if you fear you wrong me  I wou'd not injure you to gain my Safety  Amal  Nor wou'd I fail to help you to secure it  For all that  Lacedemon  holds most Precious  I gaz'd about lest any were in sight  That might prevent my dear Design to save you  Support me as I walk like one that serv'd me  And when they have unlock'd that Posterndoor  I'll give you some Command before the Guard  Which to perform they shall admit your Passage  Or this must force it if your evil Stars  Gives him her Dagger  Have plac'd such there as know and wou'd detain you  Aristom  As long as Life I'll proudly wear this Favour  Amal  Oh haste my Lord lose not this precious moment  Aristom  No stay and ere I take one step tow'rds Freedom  Let me be told to whose blest Aid I owe it  And how I may discharge so vast a Debt  Tho' I and all that's dear to me shou'd perish  I wou'd not stir 'till satisfy'd in this  Amal  Know then my Lord  Tho' whilst I speak I tremble for your Danger  That to declare my Name might work my Ruin  But since such Gratitude crowns your great Virtues  I have a Blessing to implore from you  When the full Time shall ripen and reveal it  Harder I fear to grant and much more dear  Than what I now assist you to preserve  Aristom  By Liberty which none like me can value  By newrecovered Light and what it shews me  Your brighter Form with yet a fairer Mind  By all the ties of Honour here I swear  Be that untouch'd and your Request is granted  Amal  Of you my Lord and of the list'ning Gods  I ask no morebut that you haste to 'scape  Without that Camp the open Champain lies  May Fortune which the hardest Part has done  Crown her great Work and lead you safely on  Exit  Aristom  leading her  Enter  Phila  weeping  Phila  What shall I say or how reveal this to her  Is't not enough ye Gods we bear our own  That thus you suffer the vain trifler  Love  To bring the Griefs of others too upon us  Amalintha  returns  Amal  Oh  Phila  I such Tydings have to tell thee  But thou hast chill'd them in a Moments space  With that cold dew that trickles from thine Eyes  Is not  Aristor  safe  Thou say'st he is not in that weeping silence  But lives he yet if this thou do'st not answer  My Death shall free thee from all farther Questions  Phila  Yet he do's live  But oh that some free Tongue that lov'd you less  Cou'd tell how little time that Life must last  To you so precious and I fear so fatal  Amal  Go on and if thou kill'st me with the Story  Believe thou'st crown'd the Kindness of thy Life  By giving endless Rest to her that wants it  Phila  I cannot speak  Weeping  Amal  Then one that can I instantly must seek for  Going out  Phila  Publick Enquiry pulls his Ruin on her  Stay Madam stay and since it must be told  Know that  Aristor  soon as free to do it  Again into your Father's presence rush'd  And makes a new attempt upon his Person  But miss'd his Blow was seiz'd and in Confinement  Now waits but the assembling of the Council  Throughly to be examin'd and discover'd  Amal  Darkness and Night surround me  With this Relief to my sad Bed I go  Siezes  Phila  's Dagger  There wrapt in horrid Shades will lay me down  And when thou com'st charg'd with the heavy News  Beware no tedious Circumstance deta in  No fruitless Pray'r or word of Comfort 'scape thee  But with a Voice such as the Dying use  Bid me expire  Then to my Father go  And say he kill'd his Daughter in his Foe  Who knowing she his Temper cou'd not move  Th' excess of Hate paid with th' excess of Love  Exit weeping and leaning on  Philas  The  SCENE  changes to the Plains  Enter  Climander  Clim  All Patience this wou'd tire  I will not wait the Trifler's slow return  But go my self tho' thus unarm'd amongst them  He is going and meets  Arcasius  Art thou at length come back  If 'twou'd not waste more time to blame thy stay  Old loit'ring Man I shou'd reprove thee for it  Arcas  'Twas vain to move 'till I had seen the utmost  Clim  The utmost What was that will they not Fight  Not Dye for such a General  Arcas  My Lord they will not  Tho' brave  Alcander  tries to urge their Fury  And wastes his own to put new Life into them  Sometimes he weeps and throws his Helmet from him  Kneels to his Troops and wooes them to Compassion  Which draws a gen'ral sympathizing Show'r  And makes him think he has obtain'd his Purpose  Then on his fiery Steed in haste he leaps  And cries Come on but not an Ensign waves  Or any Motion seconds the Design  The Meaner sort cry out aloud for Pay  And mutiny to be discharg'd the Service  Clim  Base mercenary Slaves Yet these I'll use  The Gold and Jewels which my Father gave  Will fire their Souls insensible of Duty  And by it's aid I'll gain what most I thirst for  A King his Claim but to one Kingdom lays  Wide as the Universe is boundless Praise  This shining Mass shall buy a glorious Name  They purchase all the World who purchase Fame  He is going  Arcas  Since you're determin'd to attempt these Dangers  Let me declare the Time to be expir'd  Which bound you in your Promise to your Father  By Artifice I wrought you to believe  Those Days remain'd which are indeed run out  Your Soul may now be free and Heaven protect you  Clim  For this discov'ry I'll return another  Worthy thy knowledge when we meet again  But now make haste and from its deep concealment  In the low Earth fetch me the Wealth I mention'd  About these Woods thy quick Return shall find me  Exeunt  Enter  Herminia  and  Barina  Bar  See we are come to soon I said 'twou'd prove so  Herm  It is no matter long we shall not wait    Bar  looks out for the Shepherds  I dare not tell her that I like this Shepherd  Nor yet indeed scarce own it to my self  'Tis strange my Mind shou'd sink thus with my Fortunes  Yet he did talk above their humble strain  And as he knew that Nature had supply'd  What Fortune had deny'd him for Attraction  Claim'd my weak Heart and said he must possess it  Bar  Sure they've put off this melancholy Meeting  Design'd in Honour of their lost Protector  In which our share tho' secret must be greatest  I see none move nor hear their mournful Notes  Herm  Be not impatient Where can we be better  Have I not heard thee say sometimes  Barina  That in a Dream form'd by the Day's discourse  Of the sweet Life that here they led in safety  My Mother saw me wed one of these Swains  And smil'd tho' I had made a Choice below me  Bar  She did and therefore never wou'd consent  That you like others shou'd behold their Revels  Nor have I since her Death left you my Charge  Allow'd it till worse Dangers forc'd us hither  Tho' of my self I ne'er observe such Trifles  Herm  D'ye call those nightly Visions then but Trifles  Bar  No doubt our Dreams are so the work of Phancy  Where things of Yesterday are odly piec'd  With what had pass'd some twenty Years before  Knit in a weak and disproportion'd Chain  Which cannot hold to lead us to the Future  Whate'er I've said I wish this had no meaning  Aside  And that some other Place cou'd give us shelter  Herm  We'll walk a while  Great  Aristomenes  now cou'd I meet thee  But that's a Blessing which I must not know  Aside  'Till where thine is my Spirit too shall go  Oh that my Grief wou'd force it to retire  And Tears for him quench this newkindl'd Fire  They go off the Stage  Enter at the other Door  Climander  Clim  Either my Eyes indulgent to my Love  Deceive my Hopes or now within their reach  That unknown Beauty moves which lately charm'd them  'Tis she and with the speed that suits my Passion  I will o'ertake and farther urge it to her  Exit  Reenter  Herminia  Herm  She fears my Fate and fain wou'd have me go  Before th' assembling Shepherds are arriv'd  And having met one that can give her tydings  Is busy to enquire about their coming  Untimely Caution  'Tis too late to move  When once o'ertaken by the wings of Love  Enter  Climander  behind her  Clim  From those fair Lips no sooner fell that word  But all the neighb'ring Ecchoes caught the Sound  And sent it doubl'd to  Climander  's Bosom  The am'rous Streams have borne it down their Banks  And the glad Plains breathe nothing since but Love  Oh speak it once again and the fond Vine  Shall with a stricter grasp embrance the Elm  Whilst joyful Birds shall hail it from the Branches  Herm  No I have spoke too much  Since on these Plains no syllable is secret  Hereafter my close Thoughts shall be confin'd  And in this Breast lock'd up from all Men's Knowledge  Clim  Oh not if Love be there it cannot be  Silence can ne'er last long nor yet conceal it  A thousand ways 'twill speak without a Voice  And whilst it struggles to obtain that Freedom  Betraying Sighs will 'scape and more declare it  'T will speak in list'ning to the Lover's Tale  And say 'tis Sympathy that makes it pleasant  Herm  He shakes my Soul whilst thus he do's describe it  For all he speaks I feel and he must find  Aside  Oh yet let me reflect upon my Birth  And quit in time the Ground I can't maintain  She's going  Clim  Nay do not fly me and I will be Speechless  For if I speak whilst on your Eyes I gaze  It must be all of Love and that offends you  Yet since perhaps I ne'er may meet you more  I wou'd have told the Story of my Heart  And e'er it breaks have mov'd you to Compassion  Herm  Meet him no more then what can Crowns afford me  Amidst the noisie Pomp that waits their Lustre  Still shou'd I vainly listen for the Sound  Aside  Of such soft Words which charm my Sorrows from me  Oh that our Births were equal as our Thoughts  Yet I will pity him and Fate be guilty  She stops and turns towards him  Clim  Blest be the Thought that thus retards your steps  And turns again those gentle Lights upon me  If Pity 'twas Oh yet indulge that warmth  And Love'twill soon produce to meet my Wishes  She looks kindly on him  'Tis done 'tis done be witness ye still Skies  That all her Looks are calm and smooth as yours  And not one Frown forbids my forward Hopes  Let this fair Hand be added to confirm them  And case the mighty longings of my Passion  Kneels and kisses her Hand  Herm  Take freely take this first and last of Favours  Now Shepherd rise and hear what I've to say  And if a Sigh mix with the fatal Sentence  Believe 'tis from the Grief with which I give it  You must not love me  She sighs  Clim  I must not love you tho' you Sigh to speak it  Shou'd  Pan  pronounce it in a Voice so loud  'Twou'd rive the knotty Oaks that shade his Altars  I wou'd to  Syrinxes  oppose your Beauties  And ask the Gods whose Loves had best Foundation  Herm  Those Gods who made our Births so disproportion'd  Wou'd say they ne'er design'd our Hands shou'd join  But see the Swains are gath'ring tow'rds this Place  Yet Shepherd know that if a Prince wou'd Love  'Tis in your Form he must successful prove  Enter  Arcasius  with a Casket  Clim  Then in this happy Form since you approve it  Behold  She interrupts him  Herm  No more as you wou'd keep th'Esteem I've shown you  Exit  Clim  Another time must tell this Secret to her  Th' Ambition of her Mind charms like her Person  Aside  Nor can the Blood that bleeds such Thoughts be abject  But welcome good  Arcasius  with that Bait  Which shall be soon dispers'd among the Soldiers  And if it win them to my great Design  'Tis worth the Kingdoms which its Price might ransom  Exeunt with the Casket follow'd by  Arcasius  Enter  Theata  and  Lamia  Lamia  The Dews are falling and the Sun declin'd  Whilst from this neighb'ring Grove are heard the Notes  Of that sweet Bird that warbles to the Night  Now telling us her Shadows are approaching  And yet the tardy Shepherds are not come  Theata  When all our Hours were gay it was not thus  But who can haste to break his chearful Pipe  Tear the sweet Garland made by her he sighs for  And sing of Death when Love is all his Passion  Lamia  Now thou dost talk of Love yet ere we part  Or fall into our melancholy Strains  Lend to that Eccho greedy of thy Voice  Some moving Words upon so soft a subject  Theata  Rather that Song I'd chuse which do's prefer  To all things else the Joys of these sweet Plains  Since now perhaps we must too soon forsake them  Lamia  A better can't be chose haste to perform it  Lest the sad Ceremony break our purpose  The SONG    She Sings  A young Shepherd his Life  In soft Pleasure still leads  Tunes his Voice to his Reed  And makes Love in the Shades  To be Great to be Wise  To be Rich to be Proud  To be loaded with Bus'ness  Or lost in a Croud  He ne'er seeks or desires  Let but  Silvia  be won  He is Great he is Rich  And his Bus'ness is done    Whilst their Nymphs are as happy  As Happy as Fair  For who has most Beauty  Has of Lovers most share  Some will stay some will sly  Some be false some be true  For the Lost we ne'er grieve  But still cherish the New  Shouts  'Tis vain of their Frailties  Or Falshoods to mind 'em  Mankind we must take  We must take as we find 'em  Theala  What Shouts are these  Shouts  Lamia  They're loud and speak some Joy and still repeated  Enter  Herminia  and  Barina  Lamia  Fair Stranger know you whence these Shouts proceed  Herm  I do not but these coming sure can tell us  Enter with great Signs of Joy  Clinias  with other Shepherds and Shepherdesses  c  Clim  Swell swell  Panisus  o'er thy spacious Bounds  Flow like our Joy and chear the Meads about thee  Pan  take in thankful Sacrifice our Flocks  And ev'ry rural Swain proclaim his Praises  Lamia  Such Sounds as these meet with a gen'ral welcome  But yet the Cause we wish to hear explain'd  Good  Clinias  tell the Cause  Clin  He is return'd and stands like Fate amongst 'em  The Plain's Protector and the Army's Genius  The Virgin's Refuge when the Town's in Flames  And Shield to those whom Fortune makes his Vassals  Herm  'Tis  Aristomenes  thou hast describ'd  No other e'er cou'd fill a Praise like this  Clin  'Tis He indeed next to the Gods our Succour  Herm  Transporting News how did the Army meet him  Clin  Just as a long stopt Current meets the Sea  And rushes on when once 't has forc'd a Passage  d Shep  Heav'n has their Plumes for high as that they toss 'em  And not a dusty Soldier in the Host  That has not hugg'd him to his swarthy Bosom  Clin  No Voice is what it was an Hour ago  And their hoarse Joy sounds like their distant Drums  His Hands as if the  Cretan  Thongs still held them  Are useless made and fetter'd now with Kisses  Whilst neighing Steeds think that the War surrounds them  And prance in Air light as their Master's Minds  d Shep  How he escap'd all ask in such Confusion  That their loud Questions drive his Answers back  And will not let them reach the nearest to him  Herm  It is enough ye Powers that guard  Messenia  We now must change our Habits and return  Aside to  Bar  What did I say return O yes I must  And never hope to see  Climander  more  To herself  Yet will I give my Heart this last Relief  Since Fate will have it bear th'unequal Passion  To let him know my Love and endless Flight  And live on the dear Thought that he laments it  Exit with  Bar  Lam  Where is  Aristor  Is he too return'd  Clin  That question did the Gen'ral ask aloud  And 'twas the only one that cou'd be heard  But no reply was made I think he is not  Theata  Then we're but half restor'd  For he so heavily will take that Loss  Our Joys will not be long nor he amongst us  La    not the worst  d Shep  I met a rumour of a stranger Prince  That with large Sums new fir'd the trembling Host  And from the Camp had led on some Design  A Party that for Wealth wou'd risque their Lives  Tho' cold and dull to Thoughts of gen'rous Duty  Clin  'Tis true of  Rhodes  they say  And some I heard that call'd him  Demagetus  Thick flew his Gold as swarms of SummerBees  And 'twas to succour or revenge the Gen'ral  He ask'd their Aid  But whither he has led them none can tell  Ere  Aristomes  return'd he went  And is not heard of since  d Shep  The Gen'ral's safe and that's enough for us  Now therefore  Clinias  you that guide our Sports  Tell us what we're to do to shew our Joy  Clin  To Laugh to Sing to Dance to Play  To rise with new appearing Day  And ere the Sun has kiss'd 'em dry  With various Rubans Nosegays tye  Deckt with Flow'rs and cloath'd in Green  Ev'ry Shepherdess be seen  Ev'ry Swain with Heart and Voice  Meet him meet him and rejoice  With redoubl'd  Paeans  sing him  To the Plains in Triumph bring him  And let  Pan  and  Mars  agree  That none's so kind and brave as He  Exeunt  ACT IV SCENE I  The General's Pavilion  Enter Drest in the Habit of an Officer  Demagetus  with  Arcasius  Dema  SH' has left the Plains and is not to be found  How cou'd'st thou bring this cruel Story to me  Ere thou had'st search'd  Messenia  's utmost Bound  And travell'd o'er the spacious World of Shepherds  She must be yet amongst their Shades conceal'd  And thro' them will I pierce like prying  Phoebus  To find my Love or lose myself for ever  Arca  You will not hear so much your Passion sways  The Reasons why I chose to see you first  Ere I proceeded to pursue her Paths  Dema  There spoke the sixty Winters that have froze thee  And turn'd swift eager Love to Icy Reasons  I must be Cold as thou art if I hear thee  Or lose one moment more in doating Questions  He's going  Arca  Behold these Tokens and let them retard you  Dema  Tokens of Love sent to the fond  Climander  Oh thou hast found a way indeed to stay me  Arca  Take that to you directed  A Letter  And 'twas my Hopes from thence of some Discovery  That kept me here 'till you had broke and read it  Dema  Then thou shalt hear it  Reads the Direction  This to  Climander  from the Nymph that leaves him  To everlasting Grief  shou'd have been added  For so 'twill prove if no more Comfort's here  He reads it  To love yet from the Object fly  Harder is than 'tis to Dye  Yet for ever I remove  Yet for ever will I love  Shepherd seek no more to find  Fate not I has been Unkind  We pluck on Fate by striving to avoid it  To shun the low Addresses of a Swain  For ever has she left a Prince despairing  Why didst thou not as I at parting bid thee  Find out and let her know my fair Intentions  And that my Birth was Noble as her Wishes  Arca  I was not negligent nor wou'd be thought so  But full of Transports when I heard your Story  Thinking the Fates wou'd now fulfill their Promise  Thro' her the Daughter to the best of Men  Fled to discover what you gave in Charge  Travers'd the Plains in a long fruitless Search  But cou'd not find that Beauty born to Bless us  Dema  I shew'd thee as we pass'd her new rais'd Hamlet  Arca  Thither at last I went but Oh too late  For ere I reach'd it the fair Guest was vanish'd  Upon the Floor lay her neglected Hook  And o'er the Door hung Boughs of fading Willow  To shew as Shepherds use the Place forsaken  That Paper there I found and near it lay  This precious Gemm that bears a wellcut Signet  Shews him a Ring  By chance sure dropt yet may assist your Purpose  Dema  Give me that Emblem of my fatal Passion  For without End is that as is this Circle  Oh that my way to Bliss shou'd seem so plain  Yet in a moment thus be lost and wilder'd  Now in the midst of Crouds and loud Applauses  That greet me for restoring them  Aristor  Must wretched  Demagetus  sigh for Love  And hang his drooping Head tho' wreath'd with Laurels  A sound of Drums and Trumpets  But hark the Gen'ral comes  To him the Oracle I have reveal'd  And all the Story of my rural Life  I'll tell him too the Cause of my new Grief  Which to relieve I instantly must leave him  A FLOURISH  Enter  Aristomenes Aristor Alcander  and other Attendants  Aristom  Why  Demagetus  art thou from my Sight  From these fond Arms that ever thus wou'd hold thee  Embracing him  Thou kind Restorer of my lov'd  Aristor  Come to the Camp and hear them shout thy Name  Whilst I declare thee equal in Command  With him who owes his Life to thy young Valour  Dema  Alas my Lord  Aristom  A Soldier sigh when courting Fame attends him  I know you Love by your own kind Confession  But that too must succeed since now your Birth  Is known to answer all the great Desires  Which to my Wonder did possess the Breast  Of that fair rural Maid whose Beauty charm'd you  We'll send and with the Pomp that suits a Princess  Since such your gen'rous Passion means to make her  Have her conducted to a rich Pavilion  And join your Hands as Heav'n has join'd your Hearts  This my  Aristor  be your pleasing Task  Enter an Attendant to  Aristomenes  Attend  The Princess is without and waits your Pleasure  Aristom  Conduct her in  I sent for her to see the generous Stranger  To  Alcander  Enter behind the Company  Herminia  and  Barina  Aristor  My Lord what you command I take in charge  To  Aristomenes  Tell me my best of Friends the way to serve you  To  Demagetus  Dema  I know it not my self and that's the Torture  Hear me my Lord nor think my Sorrows light  To  Aristomenes  For Love the only Comfort of fond Youth  Is lost for ever to the poor  Climander  Herm  Climander    To  Barina  That Name and Voice bears down my fainting Spirits  I shall be known yet have not Strength to fly  Where will this end and where's  Herminia  's Honour  To herself  Aristom  So sad a Pause still keeps us in Suspence  Proceed and if there's help on Earth we'll find it  Dema  At my return made joyful by Success  With hasty Steps and in my Heart soft Wishes  Love and a thousand flatt'ring Expectations  I sled the clam'rous Praise prepar'd to meet me  And sought the Path that led to my Desires  But ere I was advanc'd beyond the Camp  The Voice of this Old Man  Cross'd my sad way and cry'd She's gone for ever  Aristom  Perhaps 'tis some Mistake  If other Proofs are wanting to confirm it  Dema  Oh far too many for  Climander  's Peace  She own'd her Love and with this Signet bound it  And in the Folds of this dear Paper left  At once the Tokens of my Joy and Ruin  Gives the Letter and Ring to  Aristomenes  Herm  The Character and Signet will betray me  And now Necessity must make me Bold  Aside  Oh yet ere you proceed to view that Paper  She throws her self at  Aristomenes  Feet  Wrapt in Confusion hear your Daughter speak  As he is opening the Letter  And pity in her Fate all Women's Frailty  Aristom  Ha Thou dost much surprize me but go on  And 'till she has finish'd let no Word be utter'd  Dema  By all my fleeting Sorrows 'tis my Love  Nor cou'd I but to hear her speak be Silent  Aside  Aristom  Proceed and 'bate those Tears that stay thy Speech  Herm  That I have stoop'd below the Blood you gave me  And cast my doating Love upon that Shepherd  For such he is altho' a Plume adorns him  My wretched Hand and now my Tongue confesses  For by that Paper indiscreetly penn'd  The Secret wou'd be told shou'd I conceal it  But Oh my Lord since you can ne'er forgive me  A sad Recluse for ever let me live  Or Dye for Love to do my Birth more Justice  Aristom  Be comforted and farther yet unfold  How first you came acquainted with this Shepherd  Herm  To 'scape the Fury of prevailing Foes  Disguis'd I in your absence sought the Plains  And in that Habit heard the pow'rful Sighs  Of one that knew not then his own Presumption  Aristom  Were he a Prince and still wou'd urge his Suit  Wou'd'st thou receive 't and bless the Pow'rs that sent him  Herm  I shou'd not hide my Thoughts or blush to own them  Yes I cou'd bless those Pow'rs which now undo me    Demagetus  comes forward  Demag  I cannot wait these Forms Love plead my Pardon  When Sir I disobey your order'd Silence  And haste to tell her 'tis a Prince adores her  That wou'd have sought her on the lowly Plains  And for her Favour quitted all Dominion  Aristom  Then take her thou most worthy Prince of  Rhodes  Giving her to him  And know  Herminia  to encrease thy Passion  Thou hold'st that noble Hand that sav'd thy Brother  And give thy Father in this new Alliance  More Joy than when he first receiv'd and bless'd thee  Dema  Let all the Joys of Earth give place to mine  Whilst in deep silent Raptures I possess them  Taking her from  Aristomenes  For  Demagetus  is above Discourse  And will not wrong his Love with faint Expressions  Herm  So let mine flow and O  Barina  see  I smiling give my Hand now to a Shepherd  Yet fear not to offend my Mother's Ghost  Bar  No that smiles too and all that love and serve you  Arca  The Fate of  Rhodes  is clear and chearful now  And old  Arcasius  has outliv'd his Cares  Aristor  Now as a Brother take this new Embrace  To  Demagetus  Tho' all the Love it shews you had before  Aristom  Conduct her  Demagetus  to her Tent  I'll soon be there and see those Rites perform'd  That shall confirm her Yours be Kind and Happy  Exeunt  Herminia  and  Demagetus  leading her follow'd by  Arcasius Barina  and others  Aristor  is going too but is call'd back by his Father  Come back  Aristor  and the rest withdraw  For something I wou'd say to you in private  The Attendants go off  Free from the Croud and unobserv'd my Transports  I wou'd embrace and welcome thee to Life  And with a loud repeated Blessing pay  The pious Care that brought it to such Dangers  Oh that the Love of Women shou'd be thought  To pass the Fondness which a Father feels  When thus he grasps a Son of thy Perfections  Embracing him  My Dear my Lov'd  Aristor  Aristor  My Prince my Gen'ral and the Best of Fathers  Aristom  Thy Heart speaks loud and knocking at my Breast  Seems as 't wou'd close in conference with mine  Aristor  It wou'd my Lord and strives to force its Passage    Aristomenes  looses his Arms from embracing him  Aristom  Oh no my Son for now I must be plain  And tell thee thou dost lock some Secret there  Which all my depth of Kindness ne'er cou'd fathom  I see it in the Cloud that shades thy Brow  And still thy pensive Eyes are downwards cast  As thou wou'd'st seek the Grave or something lower  Long have I this observ'd  And thought whole Nights away to find the Cause  Which now my Son I urge thee to reveal  And think that He who best can love thee asks it  Aristor  Oh that you did not love or wou'd not ask it  I cannot speak for speaking must offend  Yet shou'd my Silence grieve such mighty Goodness  'Twou'd break that Heart which thus you seek to succour  Upon my Knees a strange Request I make  Offering to Kneel but his Father takes him up  That you wou'd quite forget and think me Dead  Which the approaching Battle shou'd confirm  And leave you to possess your other Comforts  Aristom  My other Comforts All are light to Thee  And when I wou'd have shar'd amongst my Race  Impartial Kindness as their Birthrights claim'd  Still to my Heart  Aristor  wou'd be nearest  Still with a Merit not to be withstood  Wou'd press beyond my cool and equal Purpose  And seize a double Portion of my Love  And wilt thou lose it now to keep thy Silence  Aristor  My Life I rather wou'd but Oh my Lord  Sighs  Aristom  Another Sigh another yet my Son  And then let Words relieve this mighty Passion  They will they will the Sweetness of thy Temper  Will melt before a just and warm Persuasion  Now let me know it  Aristor  Believe that if 'twere fit it shou'd be told  But Oh my Lord 'tis what you must not know  Aristom  Not I  Aristor  if thy Soul were bare  As is thy faded Cheek now to thy Father  It were most fit  Oh think my Son who 'twas that made it Noble  And train'd it in the Paths of Truth and Honour  Else what had hinder'd but thou might'st have been  In spite of all the Virtues with thee born  For Education is the stronger Nature  A bragging Coward or a base Detractor  A Slave to Wealth or false to Faith or Friendship  Lull'd in the common Arms of some Seducer  And lost to all the Joys of Virtuous Love  Aristor  Ha Virtuous Love  Aristom  What dost thou start why so I meant thou shou'd'st  When hastily I press'd that Word upon thee  To catch that flushing Witness in thy Face  Was all this Bait contriv'd no more my Son  No more dissembling of a Truth so plain  I see 'tis Love the best of all our Passions  And fram'd like Thee sure none cou'd e'er Despair  Nor can I fear thou'd'st make a vulgar Choice  Aristor  On  Ida  's Top not  Paris  made a nobler  When of three Goddesses he chose the Fairest  Aristom  Will she not hear thy Love  Aristor  Oh yes with all the softness of her Sex  And answers it with Vows more strong than Ours  Aristom  If thus it be what hast thou then to fear  Aristor  A Father's Wrath more dreadful to  Aristor  Than is the frown of  Jove  that shakes the Poles  And makes the Gods forget they are Immortal  Aristom  Thou wrong'st my Love in that mistaken Terror  By all those Powers I swear I will not cross thee  Be she a  Spartan  Dame 'bate me but One  And tho' a Foe I yield thou shou'd'st possess her  Aristor  I dare not ask my trembling Love forbids it  Who is that One so fatally excepted  Aristom  Then I'll by telling thee prevent that Trouble  It is the Tyrant  Anaxander  's Daughter  Whom tho' I ne'er beheld I must abhor  As borrowing her Blood from such a Fountain  Aristor  Take mine my Lord then to wash out that Stain  Offers his Breast  You'll think it has contracted by her Love  For 'tis that Tyrant's Daughter I adore  And ne'er while Life is here will change my Purpose  Aristom  Confusion seize those Words and Her that caus'd 'em  Not Groans of Earthquakes or the Burst of Thunder  The Voice of Storms urging the dang'rous Billows  E'er struck the Sense with sounds of so much Horror  It must not Oh it must not shall not be  Sooner this Dagger tho' my Soul lives in thee  Drawing  Amalintha  's Dagger  Shou'd let out thine with this prepost'rous Passion  Than I wou'd yield it e'er shou'd meet Success  Aristor  Of all the Instruments by  Vulcan  form'd  That Poinard best is fitted to my Heart  Since Her's it was whose Eyes have deeper pierc'd it  Quickly my Lord let me receive it here  And see me proud in Death to wear that Favour    Aristomenes  amaz'd looks on the Dagger and speaks to himself  Aristom  This Dagger Her's this  Anaxander  's Daughter's  Fate then is practising upon my Soul  What sudden Turns and Tryals Man can bear  Aristor  Oh do not pause  Lest fainting with the Weight of what I feel  I poorly fall unlike your Son or Soldier  Aristom  If this were Her's Her's were the grateful Vows  With which I rashly charg'd the Life she gave me  Still to himself  Aristor  Ha not a Look not one sad parting Word  Then my own Hand thus sets me free for ever  Offers to Stab himself but is stay'd by  Aristomenes  Aristom  Hold by Love and Duty yet a moment hold  Aristor  My Life they've sway'd and must command a Moment  But let it not exceed lest both I cancel  And only listen to my wild Despair  Aristom  Shall I perform them shall I hear her plead  And to a Woman's Claim resign my Vengeance  No let my Ear still sly the fatal Suit  And from her Tears be turn'd my harden'd Face  What did I say a hasty Blush has seiz'd it  For but imagining a Thing so vile  Turn back my Face from Her that shunn'd not mine  When it was Death to know and to preserve me  No let the Fiends be obstinate in Ill  Revenge be their's while Godlike Man is grateful  Enter an Attendant  Attend  Pardon my gracious Lord this bold Intrusion  Two Ladies veil'd escaping from  Phaerea  Ask with such earnestness for Prince  Aristor  That sure their Bus'ness is of mighty Moment  From one this Ring at her entreaty Sir I must deliver  Gives it to  Aristor  and Exit  Aristom  Retire and if not call'd return no more  Aristor  'Tis  Amalintha  's Ring my  Amalintha  's She's come in time to see me fall her Victim  Aristom  No to receive her from my Hand my Son  Since 'twas from her's I took this healing Weapon  That has cut off the Hate in which I held her  'Twas she that met me rising from my Grave  And fearless freed the Foe to her and  Sparta  Then in a grateful Promise was I bound  Not to deny whate'er she shou'd request  And sure thy Love before the Pomp of Crowns  Is what a Maid must ask that knows its Value  Aristor  The Transports of my Soul be thus exprest  Then let me Dye for having griev'd such Goodness  Embracing his Father's Knees  Aristom  No rise my Son go meet and chear thy Love  And to this Tent conduct the Royal Maid  Whilst in that inner Part I stand conceal'd  And hear her tell why thus she comes to seel us  Thence will I issue as occasion calls  And giving thee give all I hold most precious  He goes into the inner Tent  Aristor  goes out at the other Door and reenters immediately leading  Amalintha  veil'd follow'd by  Phila  Aristor  Dismiss that Cloud and with it all your Fears  Safe in this Camp and in  Aristor  's Love  Which ne'er was truly bless'd 'till this glad Moment  Now  Amalintha  let my Joys o'erflow  And ere I ask what brought thee to my sight  Let it be fill'd with thy amazing Beauties  And with this Hand my longing Lips be clos'd  Kisses her Hand  Amal  Thus after each short absence may we meet  Thus pleas'd thus wrapt in Love thus dying fond  But Oh  Aristor  since I last beheld you  So has this Life been threaten'd by the Fates  That to your Arms 'tis forc'd for Peace and Sa fety  Aristor  Still may they prove a Haven for my Love  Too strong for all the Shocks of rig'rous Fortune  But what beneath thy Father's Roof cou'd fright thee  Or what bold Danger break thro' his Protection  Amal  'Twas from Himself and all the Lords of  Sparta  When  Aristomenes  they found escap'd  High was their Rage as Billows in a Tempest  And all the Arts of State were put in use  To find who had assisted in his Flight  But still in vain 'till subtle vile  Clarinthus    Aristor  That Villain will be first in Blood and Mischief  But cou'd he pry into thy generous Heart  And find it there that you had nobly done it  And are not secret Thoughts secure against him  Amal  I did believe them so 'till he disprov'd it  For 'twas his Counsel when all others fail'd  To know by speaking Gods the deep Contrivance  And from the Oracle in some few Moments  The full Discov'ry will have reach'd  Phaerea  Which ere it does I was advis'd to leave  By one that heard the horrid Voice accuse me  And with a Speed unmark'd outflew the rest  Aristor  As swiftly may the bounteous Gods reward him  Amal  This my  Aristor  brings me to your Tents  But not to save my Life or 'scape their Fury  For shou'd your Heart which boldly I will claim  Be yet deny'd me by your injur'd Father  Not all his Army shou'd retard my Steps  From leading to the Town and certain Ruin  For they have sworn it with this Imprecation  That 'till 'tis done no Victory may bless them  To sacrifice the Soul that sav'd the Gen'ral  Enter  Aristomenes  from the inward Tent  Aristom  That Army you have nam'd shall first in Flames  Consume the utmost Town of  Lacedemon  Take your Security and softest Wishes  Your dear  Aristor  take and if ought more  The fair Preserver of his Father claims  Be it but nam'd and at that instant granted  Amal  Beyond  Aristor  's Heart there's no Request  No longing Thought no Hope for  Amalintha  For still his Love prescrib'd their tender Limits  Aristor  Oh let it not be thought irrev'rent Passion  If in the awful Presence of a Father  I run upon my Joys and grasp 'em thus  Embraces her  Aristom  Thou well dost intimate I shou'd retire  For Privacy is only fit for Lovers  Aristor  Pardon my Transport Sir nor thus mistake it  Aristom  No more my Son but when the Trumpet calls  Which must be soon remember thou'rt a Soldier  And that the Battle we shall lead to morrow  Will ask our best of Care and Preparation  Aristor  Never was I yet wanting to my Charge  But give me leave here to attend that Summons  Exit  Aristomenes  For Oh my  Amalintha  since thou'rt mine  Since I can tell my Heart that darling Truth  The Moments that must take me from thy sight  Will pass for lost and useless to  Aristor  And this War done which now we soon shall finish  For You not there what God will fight for  Sparta    I'll swear the Sun and radiant Light shall part  Ere I will once be found from this lov'd Presence  Amal  Confirm it all ye soft and gentle Pow'rs  And let the pattern of a Love so perfect  Reform Mankind and bless believing Women  But can I think it is  Aristor  speaks  That I behold and hear you safe from Danger  Whom late I saw assaulted so with Death  When from the Guard a Weapon you had snatch'd  And but that brave Swords length cou'd keep him from you  Hope and fond Expectation all had left me  Arm'd with this Dagger full I stood in vain  And from my Window watch'd the fatal Stroke  Which soon was to be copy'd on my Heart  Then had I meant to own your noble Love  And told mine Dying whilst the Croud had trembl'd  Aristor  I saw your dire Intent and that preserv'd me  For 'twas to stop your Arm that mine perform'd  What else had been above the Force of Nature  And when the Drums of  Demagetus  thunder'd  As thro' the shiver'd Gates he rush'd to save me  You may remember that I wou'd not meet him  Till I had told my Love what meant the Tumult  Which since has given me Fears cold as pale Death  Lest some Observer might have charg'd it on you  Trumpets sound  Amal  No for too much their own Concern engag'd them  But Oh already hark the Trumpet calls  And jealous Fame no longer lets me keep you  Must you be gone must you obey this Summons  Aristor  Oh yes I must it is the Voice of Honour  Yet do not weep  Be this Embrace the Earnest of a Thousand  Now let me lead you to  Herminia  's Tent  Then think I go more to secure your Charms  And fight to rest with Peace in these fair Arms  He leads her off  ACT V SCENE I  The  SCENE  is the Camp A Noise of Drums and Trumpets Enter  Aristomenes Aristor Demagetus Alcander  several Officers and Soldiers  Enter an Officer from the other Door and speaks to the General  Officer  MY Lord I'm from  Alcander  bid to say  The Battle he has marshall'd as you order'd  And that your Presence now is only wanted  Aristom  Tell him we come and let the Drums beat higher  Now my brave Followers be your selves to Day  And more I need not ask that know your Valour  Who've seen you at the backs of  Spartans  ride  Till their long Flight and not your Conquest tir'd you  The Soldiers shout  And Oh my Sons since they who bravely seek it  May meet with Death when all his Darts are flying  Let me Embrace and breathe my Blessings on ye  Embraces  Demagetus  Yet  Demagetus  if I 'scape him now  And Victory attends my great Endeavour  Thou shalt Thriumphant lead me into  Rhodes  Where we'll obey the Gods and save thy Country  Dem  Still you're the Best of Men as they declar'd you  Aristom  Now let me fold thee thus my Life's best Treasure  He Embraces  Aristor  but seems disorder'd and not to feel him in his Arms which he often clasps about him  Thou dost not fill my Arms 'tis Air I grasp  Nor do my Eyes behold thee  Where is my Son ha where is my  Aristor  Aristor  Here my dear Lord here pressing to your Bosom  His Voice seems to  Aristomenes  still under his disorder to be low and different to what it was usually  Aristom  From what far distant Valley comes thy Voice  It sounds so hollow scarce my Ear receives it  Aristor  What means my noble Father  Aristom  Till now my faithful Senses never fail'd me  They talk of Omens ha I must not think on't  Such chilling Damps wou'd blast a Day of Battle  Aside  Yet let my evil Genius but be true  And a fam'd End is all it can portend me  Aristor  You reason with your self and turn from us  May we not know what thus disturbs your Thoughts  Aristom  Nothinga Vapour cross'd me but 'tis gone  And now the Field the dusty Field my Sons  Must be the Scene where we shall nobly act  What our great Spirits and our Country urges  The Trumpet calls with the impatient Drum  And He that loves his Honour let him come  He draws his Sword and goes off follow'd by the rest with their Swords drawn Drums and Shouts of Battle immediately succeed  The Noise continues the  SCENE  changes to a fine Tent  Enter  Amalintha  follow'd by  Phila  Amal  Not yet enough when will this Discord end  Is there no happy Land  Where only Love and its kind Laws prevail  Where the false Trumpet slatters not to Death  Nor the more noisy Drum outcries the Dying  Oh  Phila  why shou'd Men with Hearts unmov'd  Seek the bold War and leave ours trembling for them  Now whilst I speak a chilling Fear surrounds me  And ev'ry Tread I hear is hast'ning on  Methinks to tell me all my Hopes are perish'd  Phila  Why shou'd you Madam who have pass'd already  Unhurt by Fortune thro' more threat'ning Dangers  Now faint when Reason bids you think the best  The Sound goes from us and the lucky War  Since you've the Promise of your Father's Life  Proceeds as we cou'd wish for the  Messenians  Amal  So do's it seem but yet my failing Spirits  Sink to my Heart and bid it think of Ruin  Last Night my Dreams shew'd me  Aristor  bleeding  And o'er my Head a screaming Voice proclaim'd  That  Amalintha  's hasty Fate had kill'd him  I clos'd my Eyes to catch another Vision  That might interpret or prevent the first  But all in vain no Help or Comfort found me  And wrapt in Fears I wak'd and still continue  For what's foretold so fatal to my Love  Phila  Your Fate work his it rather will protect him  But here come Tydings and the Bearer smiles  Good let them be and these vain Fears will vanish  Enter an Officer  Amal  From Prince  Aristor  Do's he live and send you  Officer  Madam he does  And bids me say what I my self can witness  That  Lacedemon  's Battle breaks to pieces  And soon will give him leave to find you here  Amal  Take this and wear it Soldier for your News  Gives him a Jewel  And may your Honours still outshine its Lustre  Stay here whilst I report this to  Herminia  If  Demagetus  too be yet in safety  Officer  He is and near  Aristor  did I leave him  Amal  Come with me  Phila  yet my Heart is heavy  And wou'd be forcing Tears to my sad Eyes  But I'll repel them with this welcome Message  And put on all the smiles of Love to meet him  Exit with  Phila  into the Tent  Officer  The Centinels have all forsook the Tents  In hopes to share the Plunder of the Foe  Finding by their retiring we prevail  But I'll report it loudly to the General  Oh here are some returning are they  Messenians  They wear the Habit yet no Face I know  Their Haste and Looks do seem to point at Mischief  I will conceal my self and watch their Purpose  He conceals himself  Enter  Clarinthus  with others disguis'd like  Messenian  Soldiers  Clar  You heard the King and the chief Lords of  Sparta  Wish that no Victory might bless our Arms  Till we had sacrific'd the Traytor's Life  That freed this Lyon which devours us all  Sold  We did we did  Clar  You've also heard 'twas  Amalintha  's Action  Sold  Yes and the King then said his Vow shou'd stand  And she had Dy'd I think had she not fled for't  Clar  'Tis true therefore when I reflected on our Curse  And saw that Conquest wou'd no more attend us  Till we perform'd what to the Gods we swore  I mov'd the King  To let me with your Aid attempt the Camp  Which if I found unguarded  I wou'd to  Sparta  soon convey the Traytress  Where she shou'd meet the Rigour of the Law  These are the Royal Tents where she must be  Therefore no more remains but to secure her  They follow him into the inner Tent and the conceal'd Officer comes out  Officer  Curst Conspiration not to be prevented  With but my single Arm against their Numbers  But to the Battle and  Aristor  's Ear I'll fly for Help  That may o'ertake and cross the bloody Purpose  Exit  The Women shriek in the inner Tent and Reenter  Clarintha  c leading in  Amalintha  and  Phila  Amal  Messenians  are ye and yet treat met thus  Restrain those Hands that gave your Gen'ral to you  Let me but hear you speak and name the Cause  Which if a just one I'll submit to Fortune  Clar  'Tis but too just and do's not ask explaining  Amal  Oh now  Clarinthus  in your Voice I read  The cruel Sentence of an angry Father  Turn not a way that Face but hear your Princess  I can't resist no Force no Help is near me  Therefore command that but my Arms be freed  And let me not be dragg'd where I must follow  Clar  Will you relying then on me for Safety  Forbear to cry for Help as we conduct you  Amal  By  Castor  's Soul I swear it  Clar  Then taking first her Dagger free her Arms  Give me your Hand and now perform your Promise  To follow where I'll lead you  Just as  Clarinthus  is offering to take her Hand she snatches  Phila  's Dagger and then answers  Clarinthus  Amal  No stay  Clarinthus  that I did not Promise  My Voice and not my Feet my Word engag'd  And whilst my Hand holds this I will not follow  Clar  So swift and subtle yet disarm and take her  Amal  Hear me but speak  Clarinthus  My Father's Life already I've secur'd  And if you yet will quit this dang'rous Purpose  Yours with Rewards as great as your Desires  Shall too be given you and all Wrongs lie bury'd  Clar  More than I love Rewards I hate  Messenia  Therefore alive or dead will bear you from 'em  He offers to seize her she keeping him off with her Dagger kneels  Amal  Oh Pity yet my Youth and wretched Fortunes  A Princess at your Feet behold in Tears  And spare the Blood the Royal Blood of  Sparta  Clar  Yes and be lost our selves to save a Trayt'ress  For such you've been to that high Blood you've boasted  I will not spare nor pity but thus seize you  He wrests the Dagger from her she rises hastily and follow'd by  Phila  escapes into the Tent  Clarinthus  pursues her and immediately the Cries of Women are heard  Enter at the other Door  Aristor  and Soldiers  Aristor  Oh we are come in time Detested Villains  Your Deaths are all that you shall meet with here  They fight  Reenter  Clarinthus  Clar  The Victim's struck which could not be borne off  Now my next Task  Must be to rescue those who shar'd the Danger  He runs at  Aristor  who kills him he speaks falling  Thou'st kill'd  Clarinthus  And  The Fiends reward thee  Aristor  Dye and those Fiends thou call'st on meet thy Spirit  I askt but that to crown the War we've ended  He and his Men fall on the rest fighting off the Stage  Enter  Amalintha  wounded and supported by  Phila  Amal  Phila  thy Hand help me to reach that Couch  The dying Bed of wretched  Amalintha  Nay do not weep since 'tis the Fate's Decree  Who let one luckless Moment interpose  Betwixt  Aristor  's coming and my Ruin  Here set me down and let this last Embrace  Sits down  Reward the Cares and Fears my Life has cost thee  Now leave me  Phila  to perform a Part  Which must not be prevented by thy Tears  Phila  Thus pale thus faint thus dying must I leave you  Amal  Yes if thou wilt obey thou must retire  But be not far and when thou seest me fall'n  Dead in  Aristor  's Arms who'll soon return  Come forth and tell him 'twas my last Request  By all our Love by all our Sighs and Sorrows  By our new Vows and swiftly faded Joys  That He wou'd yet survive his  Amalintha  Nor let my fatal Vision prove a Truth  That 'twas my Fate my hasty Fate that kill'd him  Phila  Let me but stay at least 'till he's arriv'd  Amal  'Twou'd cross my Purpose hark I hear him coming  Quickly retire and let me hide this Stream  Lest he shou'd swell it with a Flood of Tears  And waste in Grief my small remaining Life  Which I design to lavish out in Love    Phila  goes off  Amalintha  pulls her Garment over her Wound  About him let my dying Arms be thrown  Whilst I deny my parting Life one Groan  My failing Breath shall in soft Sighs expire  And tender Words spend my last vital Fire  That of my Death Men this Account may give  She ceas'd to Love as others cease to Live  Enter  Aristor  hastily and sits down by her  Aristor  How fares my Love sink not beneath your Fears  When this most lucky Hand has made them groundless  Securing to my Life its greatest Blessing  Your matchless Love and all its dying Transports  Amal  Its dying Transports did you say  Aristor  I wou'd be glad to know that Death has Transports  But are there none none that do Live and Love  That early meet and in the Spring of Youth  Uncross'd nor troubl'd in the soft Design  Set sweetly out and travel on to Age  In mutual Joys that with themselves expire  Aristor  Indeed there are but few that are thus Happy  But since our Lot it is t'encrease the number  Let us not lose a Thought on other's Fortunes  But keep them still employ'd upon our own  For in no Hearts sure Love e'er wrought more Wonders  Amal  Oh no to mine I gladly did admit it  Thro' the stern hazards of a Father's Wrath  And all the Hate of  Sparta  and  Messenia  If e'er I wept 'twas Love that forc'd the Dew  And not my Country or my colder Friendships  And on my Face when  Lacedemon  mourn'd  Suspected Smiles were seen to mock her Losses  Because that Love was on the adverse Party  Thus fond thus doating have I pass'd my Hours  And with their dear remembrance will I close  My Life's last Scene and grasp you thus in Dying  She embraces him  Aristor  Far be that Hour but Oh my  Amalintha  Proceed thus to describe thy tender Soul  And charm me with thy mighty Sense of Passion  For know 'twas that which fix'd me ever thine  When with a Pleasure not to be express'd  I found no Language of my Love escap'd thee  Tho' wrapt in Myst'ry to delude the Croud  When ev'ry longing Look cou'd raise a Blush  And every Sigh I breath'd heave this lov'd Bosom  Which held such soft Intelligence with mine  And now o'erflows with a like Tide of Pleasure  Amal  Oh Yes it do's it meets the vast Delight  And takes the Thoughts ev'n of  Elysium  from me  Nor will I as some peevish Beauty might  Take light offence that mine you did not mention  Since 'tis my equalling  Aristor  's Love  Is all the Charm I wou'd be proud to boast of  Aristor  Believe not that I slighted such Perfections  I saw you Fair beyond the Fame of  Helen  But Beauty's vain and fond of new Applause  Leaving the last Adorer in Despair  At his approach who can but praise it better  Whilst Love  Narcissus  like courts his Reflection  And seeks itself gazing on other's Eyes  When this I found in yours it bred that Passion  Which Time nor Age nor Death shall e'er diminish  Amal  For Time or Age I think not of their Power  But after Death  Aristor  cou'd you love me  Still call to me your Thoughts when so far absent  And mourn me sleeping in that Rival's Arms  Aristor  Yes if I cou'd outlive my  Amalintha  Still shou'd I turn my Eyes to that cold Grave  Still love thee there and wish to lie as low  But why do's ev'ry Period of thy Speech  Thus sadly close with that too mournful Subject  Why now I press this Question dost thou weep  Yet in my Bosom strive to hide thy Tears  Paleness is on thy Cheek and thy damp Brow  Strikes to my Heart such sympathizing Cold  As quenches all its Fire but that of Love  Oh speak my Life my Soul my  Amalintha  Speak and prevent the boding Fears that tell me  Eternal Separation is at hand  And after this I ne'er shall clasp thee more  Embraces her and she starts and groans  Amal  Oh O' O' O'  Aristor  Nay if the gentle foldings of my Love  The tender circling of these Arms can wound  'Tis sure some inward Anguish do's oppress thee  Which too unkindly thou wilt still keep secret  Amal  Secret it shou'd have been 'till Death had seal'd it  Had not that Groan and my weak Tears betray'd me  Speaks faintly  For Death which from  Clarinthus  I receiv'd  Is come to snatch my Soul from these Embraces  Aristor  Oh fatal sound but let me not suppose it  Till Art is weary'd for thy Preservation  Haste to procure it  Phila  all that hear me  Fly to her Aid or you more speedy Gods  The Cure be yours and Hecatombs attend you  But none approach then let me haste to bring it  Tho' thus to leave her is an equal Danger  Endeavours to go  Amal  Aristor  stay nor let my closing Eyes  One Moment lose the Sight that ever charm'd them  No Art can bring relief and melting Life  But lingers till my Soul receives th' Impression  Of that lov'd Form which ever shall be lasting  Tho' in new Worlds new Objects wou'd efface it  Aristor  No  Amalintha  if it must be so  Together we'll expire and trace those Worlds  As fond and as united as before  For know my Love the Sword of War has reach'd me  And none wou'd I permit to bind the Wound  Till to thy gentle Hand I cou'd reveal it  The Blood uncheck'd shall now profusely flow  And Art be scorn'd that cou  d but half restore me  Amal  Oh let me plead in Death against that Purpose  Employ my Hand yet warm to close the Wound  And with my suppling Tears disperse the Anguish  Your Country asks your stay and more your Father  This Blood is his ally'd to all his Virtues  By him more priz'd than what supports his Frame  Nor shou'd be lavish'd thus without his Licence  Oh  Aristomenes  haste to preserve it  Since Life from me departs and Love is useless  Aristor    She Dies  Aristor  Her fleeting Breath has borne far hence my Name  But soon my following Spirit shall o'ertake her  My Godlike Father gave her to my Arms  And then resign'd to her more powerful Claim  This purple Stream which wafts me to possess her  May every Power that shields paternal Goodness  Enfold his Person and support his Sway  His dear remembrance take these parting drops  He weeps  And then be free my Soul for ties more lasting  Eternal Love the faithful Lovers due  In those blest Fields which stand display'd before me  My  Amalintha    He takes her in his Arms and dies  Enter  Phila  Phila  I shou'd have come and urg'd his Preservation  If when I saw her fall my Strength had served me  But all my Cares departed with her Life  And mine I hope is now for ever going  She falls in a Swoon at  Amalintha  's Feet  Shouts of Victory Enter  Demagetus Arcasius Alcander  and several Officers their Swords drawn as coming from Battle  Demag  A glorious Day and warmly was in sought  Nor ever did a Victory more complete  Stoop to the General's Valour  Some Troops are order'd to secure  Phaerea  And with tomorrow's Sun he enters there  To take the Homage of the conquer'd  Spartans  Alcand  They say that  Anaxander  he has freed  As generously as he'd ne'er known the Dungeon  Demag  He did at Prince  Aristor  's kind Request  And now with the high Marks of Conquest crown'd  Is coming to declare to  Amalintha  That all her Wishes and her Fears are ended  Turning to go into the Tent he sees the Bodies  They are indeed for ever ever ended  Oh turn and see where that pale Beauty lies  And faithful dead  Aristor  bleeding by her  Alcand  O sudden Horror where's our Conquest now  Our lofty Boasts and brave expected Triumphs  Lie there my Sword beneath my Leader's Feet  Lays his Sword at  Aristor's  Feet  For under him I fought and now weep for him  Dema  We'll all join to encrease the mournful Shower  A Soldier for a Soldier's Fall may weep  And shed these Drops without unmanly Weakness  A Sound of Trumpets  But hark the Gen'ral how shall we receive him  A while we'll with our Bodies shade this Prospect  And tell him by our Looks some Grief attends him  Lest all his Fortitude shou'd not support  A Change so sudden in his wretched Fortune  Nor can we learn from whence this Loss proceeds  Phila  Yes that you may from me Life yet remains  And will admit of the too dire Relation  Demag  Then gently bear her hence and hear it from her  They lead off  Phila  That when the Sorrow which at first must bar  All cold Enquiries shall a while be past  The Gen'ral may be told to what he owes it  But see he enters be we Sad and Silent  For Oh too soon this fading Joy must vanish  They stand all together before the Bodies  A  FLOURISH  of Drums and Trumpets with Shouts of Joy  Enter several Officers and Soldiers the Shepherds and Shepherdesses strewing Flowers follow'd by  Aristomenes  his Sword drawn in his Hand and a Wreath of Victory on his Head  Aristom  Enough my Friends enough my FellowSoldiers  And you kind Shepherds and your gentle Nymphs  Receive my Thanks for the Perfumes you scatter  Which yet shall flourish under our Protection  Shepherds c  Great  Aristomenes  Live long and happy  Others  Live long and happy Father of  Messenia  Aristom  Now to fair  Amalintha  wou'd I speak  The joyful Tydings of this Day's Atchievements  Therefore let her be told we wish her presence  Seeing none move  Ha what none stir perhaps  Aristor  's with her  Why let him tell it from a Lover's mouth  'Twill bear a Sound more welcome and harmonious  And sure in Love and Battle none exceeds him  The last you all can witness you saw him Fight  Saw the young Warrior with his Beaver up  Dart like the Bolt of  Jove  amongst their Ranks  And scatter 'em like an Oak's farshooting Splinters  Will none confirm it this is envious Silence  Walks up and down  Thou  Demagetus  ha thou'rt all in Tears  And so are these that make a Wall about thee  The Cause deliver Oh declare it quickly  Demag  Enquire it not my Lord too soon 'twill find you  Aristom  I must prevent it by my hasty Search  Reveal it you or you since all partake it  To  Alcander  c  What silent still  If yet ye do not speak ye do not love me  I find ye do not since ye all are Speechless  Aristor  wou'd have spoke had he been here  Demag  Aristor  's here but Oh he cannot speak  You have it now my Lord and must weep with us  Aristom  Thy Tongue has warn'd my Eyes to seek the Centre  Looks down  For round this Place I dare not let them stray  Lest they explain too soon thy fatal meaning  Oh  Anaxander  had such Trembling seiz'd me  When at the Army's Head I met thy Fury  The poorest of thy Troops had cry'd me Coward  Why so we're all there's not a Man that is not  We all dread something and can shrink with Terror  Yet he that comes a Conqu'ror from the Field  Shall find a vain Applause to crown his Valour  Tho' fainting thus and sweating cold with Fear  Pauses and leans on an Officer  But didst thou say  Aristor  cou'd not speak  Oh that I live to ask it not answer to his Father  Demag  Oh never more  Aristom  The Sun will keep his Pace and Time revolve  Rough Winters pass and Springs come smiling on  But Thou dost talk of Never  Demagetus  Yet ere Despair prevails retract that Word  Whose cloudy distance bars the reach of Thought  Nor lets one Ray of Hope e'er dawn beyond it  Never Oh never  Demag  This Passion must rise higher ere it falls  Divide and let him know the worst  To the Officers  Aristom  Where is my Son my Grief has pass'd all Bounds  All dallying Circumstance and vain Delusion  And will be told directly where to find him  Demag  Oh then behold him there  They divide He seeing the Bodies stands awhile amaz'd and speechless drops his Sword then speaks  Aristom  So look'd the World to  Pyrrha  and her Mate  So gloomy waste so destitute of Comfort  When all Mankind besides lay drown'd in Ruin  Oh thou wert well inform'd my evil Genius  And the complaining Rocks mourn'd not in vain  For here my Blood my dearest Blood I pay  For this poor Wreath and Fame that withers like it  Tears the Wreath and throws himself upon his Son  The Ground that bore it take the slighted Toy  Whilst thus I throw me on his breathless Body  And groan away my Life on these pale Lips  Oh O' O' O'  Thus did I clasp him ere the Battle join'd  When Fate which then had Doom'd him mock'd my Arms  Nor in their folds wou'd let me feel my Son  Oh that his Voice tho' low as then it seem'd  Cou'd reach me nowBut the fond Wish is vain  And all but this too weak to ease my Pain  He takes the Sword that lay at  Aristor  's Feet and goes to fall upon it  Demagetus  takes hold of it  Demag  Oh hold my Lord nor stab at once your Army  All the Officers and Soldiers kneel  Alcander  speaks  Alcand  We're all your Sons and if you strike my Lord  The  Spartans  may come back and take our Bodies  For when yours goes our Spirits shall attend it  They all prepare to fall on their Swords  Aristom  Wou'd you then have me live when thus unbowell'd  Without the Charms of my  Aristor  's presence  Without his Arm to second me in Fight  And in still Peace his Voice to make it perfect  He rises in a Passion and comes forward on the Stage  Yes I will live ye Sov'reign Pow'rs I will  You've put my Virtue to its utmost Proof  Yet thus chastis'd I own superiour Natures  And all your fixt Decrees this Sword shall further  'Till  Rhodes  is rescu'd and my Task completed  Who knows but that the Way to your  Elysium  Is Fortitude in Ills and brave Submission  Since Heroes whom your Oracles distinguish  Are often here amidst their Greatness wretched  But yet my Heart my lov'd my lost  Aristor  Demag  Let me succeed him in his active Duty  And join with all the Earth to bring you Comfort  Aristom  Comfort on Earth Oh 'tis not to be found  My  Demagetus  thou hast far to travel  The Bloom of Youth sits graceful on thy Brow  And bids thee look for Days of mighty Pleasures  For prosp'rous Wars and the soft Smiles of Beauty  For generous Sons that may reflect thy Form  And give thee Hopes as I had of their succour  Demag  With these indeed my Thoughts have still been flatter'd  Aristom  Then let me draw this flatt'ring Veil aside  And bid thee here here in this Face behold  How biting Cares have done the work of Age  And in my best of Strength mark'd me a Dotard  Defeated Armies slaughter'd Friends are here  Disgraceful Bonds and Cities laid in Ashes  And if thou find'st that Life will yet endure it  Since what I here have lost  So bow'd so waining shalt thou see this Carcass  That scarce thou wilt recall what once it was  Then be instructed Thou and All that hear me  Not to expect the compass of soft Wishes  Or constant Joys which fly the fond Possessor  Since  Man  by swift returns of Good and Ill  In all the Course of Life's uncertain still  By Fortune favour'd now and now opprest  And not 'till Death secure of Fame or Rest  FINIS
