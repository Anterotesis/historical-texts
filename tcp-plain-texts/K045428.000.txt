not o  of all this multitude was at home they were a bound to a far distant country Though it w  permitted by the Lord of the land that these P  +grims might associate together for their prese  mutual comfort and convenience and each w  not only allowed but commanded to do the othe  all the services he could upon their journey  it was decreed that every individual travell  must enter the far country singly There was  great gulf at the end of the journey which eve  +one must pass alone and at his own risk and t  friendship of the whole united world could be no use in shooting that gulf The exact time wh  each was to pass was not known to any this the Lo  always kept a close secret out of kindness  still they were as sure that the time must come a  that at no very great distance as if they w  informed of the very moment Now as they kn  they were always liable to be called away at  hour's notice one would have thought they wo  have been chiefly employed in packing up a  preparing and getting every thing in order  they indeed It was almost the only thing wh  they did not think about  Now I only appeal to you my readers if any  ou are setting out upon a little common journey  f it is only to London or York is not all your leisure time employed in settling your business at  ome and packing up every little necessary for  our expedition And does not the fear of neglecting  ny thing you ought to remember or may have oc  asion for haunt your mind and sometimes even  trude upon you unseasonably And when you  re actually on your journey especially if you  ave never been to that place before or are likely  remain there don't you begin to think a little  out the pleasures and the employments of the  ace and to wish to know a little what sort of a  y London or York is Don't you wonder what  doing there and whether you are properly qua  f  ed for the business or the company you expect  be engaged in Do you never look at the map  consult Brookes's Gazetteer And don't you try  pick up from your fellow passengers in the stage  ach any little information you can get And  ough you may be obliged out of civility to  nverse with them on common subjects yet do  your secret thoughts still run upon London or  ork its business or its pleasures And above all  you are likely to set out early are you not afraid  oversleeping and does not that fear keep you  on the watch so that you are commonly up and  ady before the porter comes to summon you  ader if this be your case how surprised will  be to hear that the Travellers to the far coun  have not half your prudence though bound  a journey of infinitely more importance to a  d where nothing can be sent after them and  which when they are once settled all errors  irretrievable  I observed that these pilgrims instead of bein  upon the watch lest they should be ordered o  unprepared instead of laying up any provision  or even making memorandums of what they would be likely to want spent most of their time i  crowds either in the way of traffic or diversion▪ At first when I saw them so much engaged in co  +versing with each other I thought it a good sig  and listened attentively to their talk not doubtin  but the chief turn of it would be about the cl  +mate or treasures or society they should pr  +bably meet with in the far country I suppos  they might be also discussing about the best an  safest road to it and that each was availing hi  +self of the knowledge of his neighbour on a subje  of equal importance to all I listened to eve  party but in scarcely any did I hear one wo  about the land to which they were bound thou  it was their home where their whole interest  +pectation and inheritance lay to which also gr  part of their friends were gone before and w  +ther they were sure all the rest would follo  Their whole talk was about the business or  pleasures or the fashions of the strange co  +try which they were merely passing through and which they had not one foot of land which th  were sure of calling their own for the next quar  of an hour What little estate they had was  perso  and not real and that was a mortgaged lifehold  +nement of clay not properly their own but only  to them on a short uncertain lease of which thr  score years and ten was considered as the long period and very few indeed lived in it to the  of the term for this was always at the will of  Lord part of whose prerogative it was that he  ould take away the lease at pleasure knock  own the stoutest tenement at a single blow and  urn out the poor shivering helpless tenant naked  o that far country for which he had made no  rovision Sometimes in order to quicken the  ilgrim in his preparations the Lord would break  own the tenement by slow degrees sometimes he  ould let it tumble by its own natural decay for as it  as only built to last a certain term it would some  es grow so uncomfortable by increasing dilapida  ons even before the ordinary lease was out that  e lodging was hardly worth keeping though the  nant could seldom be persuaded to think so but  ng to it to the last First the thatch on the top of  e tenement changed colour then it fell off and left  roof bare then "the grinders ceased because  ey were few" then the windows became so dark  ed that the owner could scarcely see through  m then one prop fell away then another then  uprights became bent and the whole fabric  mbled and tottered with every other symptom  a falling house On some occasions the Lord  dered his messengers of which he had a great va  ty to batter injure deface and almost demolish  frail building even while it seemed new and  ong this was what the landlord called  giving  rning  but many a tenant would not take it and  s so fond of staying where he was even un  all these inconveniences that at last he was  out by ejectment not being prevailed on to  ve his dwelling in a proper manner though one  uld have thought the fear of being turned out  uld have whetted his diligeace in preparing for  a better and more enduring inheritance▪  For thoug  the people were only tenants at will in these cra  enements yet through the goodness of the sa  Lord they were assured that he never turned the  out of these habitations before he had on his pa  provided for them a better so that there was not su  another landlord in the world and though their pr  sent dwelling was but frail being only slightly  up to serve the occasion yet they might hold the  future possession by a most certain tenure the wo  of the Lord himself which was entered in a c  venant or titledeed consisting of many shee  and because a great many good things were give  away in it a book was made of which eve  soul might get a copy This indeed had not a  ways been the case because till a few ages bac  there had been a sort of monopoly in the case an  "the wise and prudent" that is the cunning an  fraudful had hid these things from the "babes an  sucklings" that is from the low and ignorant an  many frauds had been practised and the poor ha  been cheated of their right so that not being allo  +ed to read and judge for themselves they had be  sadly imposed upon but all these tricks had be  put an end to more than two hundred years when  passed through the country and the meanest ma  who could read might then have a copy so that  might see himself what he had to trust to and eve  those who could not read might hear it read on  or twice every week at least without pay But  surprised me to see how few comparatively ma  use of these vast advantages Of those who  had  copy many laid it carelessly by expressed a  gen  +ral  belief in the truth of the titledeed a  gener  satisfaction that they should come in for a share of the inheritance a  general  good opinion of the Lord whose word it was and a  general  disposition to take his promise upon trust always however intending at a  convenient season  to inquire farther into the matter and this neglect of theirs was construed into a forfeiture of the inheritance  At the end of this country lay the vast gulf mentioned before it was shadowed over by a broad  nd thick cloud which prevented the pilgrims from seeing in a distinct manner what was doing behind it▪ yet such beams of brightness now and  hen darted through the cloud as enabled those who  sed a telescope provided for that purpose to  ee  the substance of things hoped for  but it was not  very one who could make use of this telescope  o eye indeed was  naturally  disposed to it but an  arnest desire of getting a glimpse of the invisible  ealities gave such a strength and steadiness to the  ye as enabled it to discern many things which  ould not be seen by the natural sight Above the  loud was this Inscription  The things which are  are temporal but the things which are not  n are eternal  Of these last many glorious de  riptions had been given but as those splendors  ere at a distance and as the pilgrims in general  d not care to use the telescope these distant  ances made little impression The glorious  heritance which lay beyond the cloud was  alled  The things above  while a multitude of tri  ing objects which appeared contemptibly small  hen looked at through the telescope were called  The things below  Now as we know it is nearness which gives size and bulk to any object it was  not wonderful that these ill'judging pilgrims were more struck with these baubles and trifles which by lying close at hand were visible and temp  +ing to the naked eye and which made up th  sum of  The things below  than with the remo  glories of  The things above  but this was chief  owing to their not making use of the telescope through which if you examined thoroughly  T  things below  they seemed to shrink almost down t  nothing while  The things above  appeared the mo  beautiful and vast the more the telescope was used▪ But the surprising part of the story was this no  that the pilgrims were captivated at first sight wit  The things below  for that was natural enough bu  that when they had tried them all over and over and found themselves deceived and disappointed in almost every one of them it did not at a  lessen their fondness and they grasped at the  again with the same eagerness as before Ther  were some gay fruits which looked alluring but o  being opened instead of a kernel they were found to contain rottenness and those which seemed th  fullest often proved on trial to be quite hollow an  empty Those which were most tempting to the ey  were often found to be wormwood to the taste o  poison to the stomach and many flowers that seem+ed most bright and gay had a worm gnawing at th  root  Among the chief attractions of  The things below  were certain little lumps of yellow clay on which almost every eye and every heart was fixed Whe  I saw the variety of uses to which this clay could be converted and the respect which wa  shewn to those who could scrape together the greate  number of pieces I did not much wonder at the gene+ral  desire to pick up some of them But when I be  eld the anxiety the wakefulness the competitions be contrivances the tricks the frauds the scuffling  e pushing the turmoiling the kicking the shov  g the cheating the circumvention the envy the  alignity which was excited by a desire to possess  is article when I saw the general scramble among  ose who had little to get much and of those who  d much to get more then I could not help applying to these people a Proverb in use among us  at gold may be bought too dear  Though I saw  at there were various sorts of baubles which en  ged the hearts of different Travellers such as an  of red or blue ribbon for which some were  ntent to forfeit their future inheritance commit  g the sin of Esau without his temptation of hun  r yet the yellow clay I found was the grand ob  ct for which most hands scrambled and most souls  re risked One thing was extraordinary that the  arer these people were to being turned out of  ir tenement the fonder they grew of these pieces  clay so that I naturally concluded they meant  take the clay with them to the far country but  oon learnt this clay was not current there the  rd having declared to these pilgrims that as  y had brought nothing into this world they could  ry nothing out  I inquired of the different people who were rais  g the various heaps of clay some of a larger  e of a smaller size why they discovered such  remitting anxiety and for whom Some whose  es were immense told me they were heaping up  their children this I thought very right till on  ting my eyes round I observed many of the chil  en of these very people had large heaps of their  own Others told me it was for their grandchildre  but on enquiry I found these were not yet born a  in many cases there was little chance that they ev  would The truth on a close examination prov  to be that the true genuine heapers really heap  for themselves that it was in fact neither for frie  or child but to gratify an inordinate appetite  their own Nor was I much surprised after this  see these yellow hoards at length  canker and  rust of them become a witness against the hoarde  and e  t their flesh as it were fire  Many however who had set out with a high he  of their father's raising before they had got o  third of their journey had scarcely a single pie  left As I was wondering what had caused the enormous piles to vanish in so short a time I spi  scattered up and down the country all sorts of o  inventions for some or other of which the va  possessors of the great heaps of clay had truck  and bartered them away in fewer hours than th  ancestors had spent years in getting them togeth  O what a strange unaccountable medley it wa  and what was ridiculous enough I observed th  the greatest quantity of the clay was always e  +changed for things that were of no use that I cou  discover owing I suppose to my ignorance of  manners of that country  In one place I saw large heaps exhausted  order to set two idle pampered horses a runnin  but the worst part of the joke was the horses  not run to fetch or carry any thing but merely let the gazers see which could run fastest N  this gift of swiftness exercised to no one use  purpose was only one out of many instances  talents used to no end In another place I  hole piles of the clay spent to maintain long  anges of buildings full of dogs on provisions  hich would have nicely fattened some thousands  f pilgrims who sadly wanted fattening and whose  agged tenements were out at elbows for want of little  help to repair them Some of the piles  ere regularly pulled down once in seven years  order to corrupt certain needy pilgrims to  their consciences Others were spent in play  ng with white stiff bits of paper painted over  ith red and black spots in which I thought there  ust be some conjuring because the very touch of  ese painted pasteboards made the heaps fly from  e to another and back again to the same in a  ay that natural causes could not account for  here was another proof that there must be some  agic in this business which was that if a pasteboard  th red spots fell into a hand which wanted a black  e the person changed colour his eyes flashed  e and he discovered other symptoms of madness  hich showed there was some witchcraft in the case  hese clean little pasteboards as harmless as they  oked had the wonderful power of pulling down  e highest piles in less time than all the other  ses put together I observed many small piles  re given in exchange for an enchanted liquor  hich when the purchaser had drank to a little ex  ss he lost all power of managing the rest of his  ap without losing the love of it  Now I found it was the opinion of sober pilgrims  at either hoarding the clay or trucking it for any  ch purposes as the above was thought exactly  e same offence in the eyes of the Lord and it is expected that when they should come under  more immediate jurisdiction in the far country  the penalty annexed to hoarding and squanderi  would be nearly the same While I examined t  countenances of the owners of the heaps I o  +served that those who I well knew never intend  to make any use at all of their heap were f  more terrified at the thought of losing it or of bei  torn from it than those were who were employi  it in the most useful manner Those who  knew what to do with it set their hearts least upo  it and were always most willing to leave it B  such riddles were common in this odd country  Now I wondered why these Pilgrims who we  naturally made erect with an eye formed to loo  up to  The things above  yet had their eyes almo  constantly bent in the other direction rivetted  the earth and fastened  on things below  just lik  those animals who walk on all four I was to  they had not always been subject to this weakne  of sight and proneness to earth That they ha  originally been upright and beautiful having be  created after the image of the Lord who was him+self the perfection of beauty that he had place  them in a far superior situation which he had give  them in perpetuity but that their first ancesto  fell from it through pride and carelessness th  upon this the freehold was taken away they lo  their original strength brightness and beauty an  were driven out into this strange country whe  however they had every opportunity given them  recovering their health and the Lord's favo  and likeness for they were become so disfigured an  were grown so unlike him that you would hard  believe they were his own children though in som  the resemblance was become again visible Th  Lord however was so merciful that instead  iving them up to the dreadful consequences of  eir own folly as he might have done without any  peachment of his justice he gave them immedie comfort and promised them that in due time  own Son should come down and restore them  the future inheritance which he should purchase  r them And now it was that in order to keep up  ir spirits after they had lost their estate through  e folly of their ancestors that he began to give  em a part of their former Title Deed He con  ued to send them portions of it from time to  e by different faithful servants whom however  ese ungrateful people generally used ill and  me of whom they murdered But for all this  Lord was so very forgiving that he at length  these mutineers a Proclamation of full and free  rdon by his Son who though they used him in  more cruel manner than they had done any of  servants yet after having  finished the work his  ther had given him to do  went back into  country to prepare a place for all them who  lieve in him and there he still lives begging  d pleading for those unkind people whom he  ll loves and forgives and will restore to the  chased inheritance on the easy terms of their  ing heartily sorry for what they have done tho  ghly desirous of pardon and convinced that  He  able and willing to save to the utmost all them that  unto him  I saw indeed that many old offenders appeared  be sorry for what they had done that is they did  like to be punished for it They were willing  ough to be delivered from the penalty of their  but they did not heartily wish to be delivered  the power of it Many declared in the most  public manner once every week that they we  very sorry they had done amiss but it was  enough to  declare  their sorrow ever so often  they gave no other sign of their penitence  there was so little truth in them that the Lord r  +quired other proofs of their sincerity beside the  own word for they often lied with their lips an  dissembled with their tongue But those who pr  +fessed to be penitents were neither allowed  raise heaps of clay by circumventing their neig  +bours or to have great piles lying by them usele  nor must they barter them for any of these id  vanities which reduced the heaps on a sudden for I found that among the grand articles of futu  reckoning the use they had made of the hea  would be a principal one  I was sorry to observe many of the fairer pa  of these Pilgrims spend too much of their hea  in adorning and beautifying their tenements  clay in painting and white washing and ename  +ling them All those tricks however did not pr  +serve them from decay and when they grew ol  they even looked worse for all this cost and va  +nish Some however acted a more sensible pa  and spent no more upon their mouldering te  +ments than just to keep them whole and clean an  in good repair which is what every tenant oug  to do and I observed that those who were mod  +rate in the care of their own tenements were mo  attentive to repair and warm the ragged tenements  others But none did this with much zeal or acce  +ance but those who had acquired a habit of ov  looking the  things below  and also by the consta  use of the Telescope had got their natural we  and dim sight so strengthened as to be able to  pretty distinctly the nature of the  things above  e habit of fixing their eyes on these glories  ade all the shining trifles which composed the  of  things below  at last appear in their own  minutive littleness For it was in this case parti  ularly true that things are only big or little by  mparison and there was no other way of mak  g the  things below  appear as small as they really  re but by comparing them by means of the Tele  ope with the  things above  But I observed that  e false judgment of the Pilgrims ever kept pace  th their wrong practices for those who kept their  es fastened on the  things below  were reckoned  in their generation while the few who look  forward to the future glories were account  by the bustlers or heapers to be either fools  mad  Wellmost of these Pilgrims went on in adorn  g their tenements adding to their heaps grasp  g the  things below  as if they would never let  em go shutting their eyes instead of using their te  scope and neglecting their Title Deed as if it was  Parchment of another man's estate and not their  n till one after another each felt his tenement  mbling about his earsO  then what a busy  stling anxious terrifying distracting moment was  at What a deal of business was to be done and  hat a strange time was this to do it in Now to  e the confusion and dismay occasioned by having  every thing to the last minute First some  was sent for to make over the yellow heaps to  other which the heaper now found would be of  use to himself in shooting the gulf a transfer  hich ought to have been made while the tenement  s sound Then there was a consultation between  two or three masons at once perhaps to try to pat  up the walls and strengthen the props and stop  decays of the tumbling tenement but not till  masons were forced to declare it was past repairing a truth they were rather too apt to keep back di  the tenant seriously think it was time to pac  up prepare and begone Then what sending  the wise men who professed to explain the Tit  Deed And oh what remorse that they had ne  +lected to examine it till their senses were too con+fused for so weighty a business What reproache  or what exhortations to others to look better after their own affairs Even to the wisest of the inh  +bitants the falling of their tenements was a solemn thing solemn but not surprising they had lo  been packing up and preparing they praised the Lord's goodness that they had been suffered to sta  so long many acknowledged the mercy of thei  frequent warnings and confessed that those ver  dilapidations which had made the house uncomfor+table had been a blessing as it had set them  diligent preparation for their future inheritance▪ had made them more earnest in examining their titl  to it and had set them on such a frequent applica+tion to the telescope that  The things above  ha  seemed every day nearer and nearer These de+sired not to be  uncloathed but to be cloathed upon for they knew that if their frail Tabernacle was dis+solved they had an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens  THE END
