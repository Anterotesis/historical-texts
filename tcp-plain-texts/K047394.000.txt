 WHICH IS THE MAN A COMEDY AS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN By Mrs COWLEY  LONDON  Printed for C DILLY in the Poultry Price One Shilling and Sixpence  It having been reported that the Comedy was written by a Military Character a Gentleman of acknowledged genius favoured the Author with the following  PROLOGUE  Spoken by  MR LEE LEWES  dressed as an Officer  CALL'D forth Thalia's standard to display  And here maintain her sov'reign comic sway  As ChiefI'll reconnoitre well the ground  To learn what hostile lines are drawn around  Surveys the House with a glass  That's not a dark defile in yonder glade  For should it prove a treach'rous ambuscade  No  puffing  miners have I here in pay  To sap their works or turn their covert way  No mercenary band who have been wont  To hack and hew like pioneers in front  With flying shells our Engineers shall try  That wellmann'd battlement which tow'rs so high  Pointing to the Upper Gallery  Beneath our pointblank shot will surely reach  And in yon halfmoon'd battery make a breach  To the Second Gallery  These lovely breastworks that adorn the field  To Nature's gentle summons soon must yield  SideBoxes c  This advanc'd post the picketguard to keep  And that reserve who are entrench'd chindeep  We hope to carry by a bold exertion  At least amuse with some wellplann'd diversion  To the Pit  My troops are vet'ransit has been their lot  To form in front of service hissinghot  Who when their ranks are gall'd or put to flight  Are sure to rally and renew the fight  Unlessand then no lightdragoons scour fleeter  Their powder fails for want of true saltpetre  Our plan's avow'd it is from this firm station  To gain the heights of public approbation  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Fitzherbert  Mr  Henderson  Beauchamp  Mr

IS THE MAN  ACT I  SCENE I  A DRAWINGROOM  Mrs  JOHNSON  crosses the Stage a Boy following  Mrs Johns  HERE Betty Dick Where are ye Don't you see my Lord  Sparkle  's carriageI shall have my lodgers disturbed with their thunderingWhat in the name of wonder can bring him here at this time in the morningHere he comes looking like a rake as he is  Enter  LORD SPARKLE  yawning  Spark  Bid 'em turn I shan't stay a momentSo Mrs  Johnson  I pull'd the string just to see how your Sylvans go on  Mrs Johns  As usual my Lord but bless me how early your Lordship is  Spark  How late you meanI have not been in bed since yesterday at oneI am going home now to rest for an hour or two and then to the DrawingroomBut what are the two rustics about I have not been plagued with them these three or four days  Mrs Johns  They are now out  Spark  I suppos'd that or I should not have call'dBut prithee do they talk of returning to their native woods again  Mrs Johns  Oh no SirThe young gentleman seems to have very different ideasMiss too has great spirits though she seems now and then at a loss what to do with herself  Spark  Do with herself Why don't you persuade her to go back to Cornwall You should tell 'em what a vile place London is full of snares and debaucheries and witchcraftsYou don't  preach  to 'em  Johnson  Mrs Johns  Indeed I do my Lord and their constant answer is  "Oh Lord  Sparkle  is our friend Lord  Sparkle  would take it amiss if we should go 'twould look like distrusting his Lordship"  Spark  Was ever man so hamper'dTwo fools to mistake common forms and civilities for attachments  Mrs Johns  I fear my Lord towards the young Lady something  more  than forms  Spark  interrupting  Never upon my honourI kissed her so I did all the women in the parishthe septennial ceremony The Brother I us'd to drink vile Port with listen to his villagestories call his vulgarity wit and his impudence spirit Was not that fatigue and mortification enough but I must be  bored  with 'em here in Town  Mrs Johns  But  Miss  Sir talks of pressing invitations and letters and  Spark  Things of course they had influence and got me the borough I in return said she was the most charming girl in the world that I ador'd herand some few things that every body says on such occasions and nobody thinks of  Mrs Johns  But it appears that Miss  did  think  Spark  Yes 'faith and on my writing a civil note that I should be happy to see them in Town  et caetera  which  I  meant to have suspended our acquaintance till the General Electionthey took me at my word and before I thought the letter had reach'd 'em they were in my house all joy and congratulation I didn't chuse to be encumber'd with 'em so placed 'em with you The Boy was at first amusing but our Circles have had him and I must be rid of him  Mrs Johns  I must say I wish I was quit of them at present for my constant lodger Mr  Belville  came to town last night and he wants this drawingroom to himself he's oblig'd to share it now with Mr  Pendragon  and his sister  Spark  Hey  Belville  'Gad that's lucky There is not a fellow in Town better receiv'd by the womenThrow the girl in his way and get quit of her at once  Mrs Johns  If you mean dishonestly my Lord you have mistaken your person I did not live so many years with your mother to be capable of such a thingAh my Lord if my Lady were living  Spark  She would scold to little purposeand you may spare yourself the troubleI tell you I care nothing about the girl I merely want to get rid of her and you must assist me  Mrs  Johnson  turns from him with disgust  Heydey the nicety of your Ladyship's honour is piqued Ha ha hathe mistress of a lodginghouse  Bien drole  Ha ha ha  Exit Mrs  Johnson  But who is this hobbling up stairsHa old Cato the Censor my honourable cousinWhat the devil shall I doNo avoiding him however  Enter Mr  FITZHERBERT  I wish I had been out of the house  Fitzherbert  before you appeared I know I shall not escape without some abuse  Fitzh  I never throw away reproof where there are no hopes of amendmentyour Lordship is safe  Spark  Am I to take that for wit  Fitzh  No for then I fear you would not understand it  Spark  Positively you must give me more of the felicity of your conversation I want you to teach me some of that happy ease which you possess in your rudeness 'twould be to me an acquisition I am eternally getting into the most horrid scrapes merely by politeness and goodbreedingHere are two persons now in this house for instance  Fitzh  interrupting  Who do  not  know that the language of what  you  call politeness differs from that of truth and honourYou see I know those to whom you alludeBut we only lose timeGood day my Lord  Spark  Lose time Ha ha haWhy of what value can time be to you the greatest enemy you have adding every day to your wrinkles and illhumour I'll prove to you now that I have employ'd the last twelve hours to better purpose than you have Nine of them you slept awaythe last three you have been running about Town  snarling  and making people uneasy with themselveswhilst I  have been sitting peaceably at Weltjie's where I have wonguess what  Fitz  Half as much as you lost yesterdaya thousand or two guineas perhaps  Spark  Guineas Poh you are jesting Guineas are as scarce with us as in the coffers of the Congress Like them we stake with counters and play for solid earth  Fitz  impatiently  Well  Spark  Bullion is a mercantile kind of wealth passing thro' the hands of drysalters vinegarmerchants and LordMayors  Our  Goddess holds a cornucopia instead of a purse from which she pours cornfields fruitful vallies and rich herds This morning she popp'd into my dicebox a snug villa five hundred acres arable and pasture with the next presentation to the living of Guzzleton  Fitz  A churchliving in a diceboxWell well I suppose it will be bestow'd as worthily as it was gain'dGood day my Lord good day  Turning from him  Spark  Good night Crabtreegood night  Going off  Enter a  SERVANT  Tell  Belville  I call'd to congratulate his escape from the stupid country  Going  Fitz  My Lord  Spark  returning  Sir  Fitz  I am going this morning to visit Lady  Bell Bloomer  I give you this intimation that we may not risk another rencontre  Spark  Civilly design'd and for the same polite reason I inform you that I shall be there in the evening  Exit Lord  Sparkle  Fitz  Your master in bed yet What time was he in Town yesterday  Serv  Late SirWe should have been earlier but we met with Sir Harry Hairbrain on the road with his new foxhoundsFell in with the hunt at Bagshotbroke cover run the first burst across the heath towards Datchetshe then took right an end for Egham sunk the wind upon us as far as Staines where Reynard took the road to Oxford and we the route to Town Sir  Bowing  Fitzh  Very geographical indeed SirNow pray inform your masterOh here we come  Enter  BELVILLE  in a robe de chambre  Just risen from your pillowsAre you not asham'd of this A foxhunter and in bed at eleven  Belv  My dear morose charming quarrelsome old friend I am ever in characterIn the country I defy fatigue and hardshipUp before the lazy slut Aurora has put on her pinkcoloured gown to captivate the ploughboysscamper over hedge and ditch Dead with hunger alight at a cottage drink milk from the hands of a brown wench and eat from a wooden platter In Town I am a fine gentleman have my hair exactly dressed my cloaths  au dernier gout  dine on madedishes drink Burgundy and in a word am everywhere the  ton  Fitz  So much the worse so much the worse young man To be the  ton  where Vice and Folly are the ruling deities proves that you must be sometimes a fool at others a  Belv  interrupting  Psha you satirists like moles shut your eyes to the light and grope about for the dark side of the human character there is a great deal of goodsense and goodmeaning in the world As for its follies I think folly a mighty pleasant thing at least to play the fool  gracefully  requires more talents than would set up a dozen cynics  Fitzh  Then half the people I know must have  wond  rful  talents for they have been playing the fool from sixteen to sixty  Apropos  I found my precious kinsman Lord  Sparkle  here  Belv  Ay there's an instance of the happy effects of total indifference to the sage maxims you recommend  Fitz  Happy  effects do you call them  Belv  Most triumphant Who so much admired who so much the fashionthe general favourite of the Ladies and the common object of imitation with the men Is not Lord  Sparkle  the happy man who's to carry the rich and charming widow Lady  Bell Bloomer  from so many rivalsAnd will not you after quarrelling with him half your life leave him a fine estate at the end of it  Fitz  No noI tell you No  With warmth  Belv  Nay his success with the widow is certainHe boasts his triumph everywhere and as she is such a favourite of yours every thing else will follow  Fitzh  No for if she marries  Sparkle  she will be no longer a favourite Yet she receives him with a degree of  distinction that sometimes makes me fear it for we frequently see women of accomplishments and beauty to which every heart yields homage throw themselves into the arms of the debauched the silly and the vain  Enter a  SERVANT  Serv  Mr  Beauchamp  Exit  Fitzh  Oh I expected him to call on you this morning You must obtain his confidence it will assist me in my designs When I found myself disappointed in my hopes of his Lordship I selected  Beauchamp  from the younger branches of my family but of this he knows nothing and thinks himself under high obligations to the patronage of the Peer an error in which I wish him to continue as it will give me an opportunity of proving them bothBut here he comesThis way I can avoid him  Exit  Enter  BEAUCHAMP  Belv  Beauchamp  and in regimentalsWhy prithee  George  what spirit has seized thee now When I saw thee last thou wert devoted to the grave profession of the Law or the Church and I expected to have seen thee invelop'd in wig wrangling at the bar or seated in a fat benefice receiving tythepigs and poultry  Beauch  Those  Be  ville  were my schooldesigns but the fire of youth gave me ardors of a different sort The heroes of the Areopagus and the Forum have yielded to those of Marathon and I feel that whilst my country is struggling amidst surrounding foes I ought not to devote a life to learned indolence that might be gloriously hazarded in her defence  Belv  smiling  I shan't give you credit now for that fine flourishThis sudden ardor for "the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war"I dare swear this heroic spirit springs from the whim of some fine Lady who fancied you would be a smarter fellow in a cockade and gorget than in a stiff band and perriwig  Beauch  If your infinuation means that my heart has not been insensible of the charms of some fair Lady you are right but my transformation is owing to no whim of her's for oh  Charles  she never yet condescended to make me the object of her thoughts  Belv  Modest tooAy you were right to give up the  LawBut who pray may this exalted Fairone be who never  condescended  Beauch  I never suffer my lips to wanton with the charming sounds that form her name I have a kind of  miserly  felicity in gloting on her dear idea that would be impaired should it be known to exist in my heart  Belv  Ha ha ha who  can  be the nymph who has inspired so  obsolete  a passionIn the days of chivalry it wou'd have been the  ton  Beauch  I will gratify you thus far The Lady has beauty wit and spirit but above all a  mind  Is it possible  Charles  to love a woman without a mind  Belv  Has she a mind for you That is the most important question  Beauch  I dare not feed my passion with so presumptuous a hope yet I would not extinguish it if I could for it is not a love that tempts me into corners to wear out my days in complaints it prompts me to use them for the most important purposesthe ardors it gives me shall be felt in the land of our enemies they shall know how  well  I love  Belv  Poh poh this is the gallantry of One Thousand One Hundred and One the kind of passion that animated our fathers in the fields of Cressy and PoictiersWhy no Beauty of our age man will be won in this stileNow suppose yourself at the Opera  looking through his hand  "Gad that's a fine girl Twenty thousand you say I think I'll have her Yes she'll do II must have her I'll call on her tomorrow and tell her so"  Have you spirit and courage enough for that my Achilles  Beauch  No truly  Belv  Then give up all thoughts of being received  Beauch  I have no thoughts of hazarding a reception The pride of birth and a few hundreds for my education were the sole patrimony the imprudence of a father left me My relation Lord  Sparkle  has procured for me a commissionGenerously to offer that and a knapsack to a Lady of five thousand a year would be properly answered by a contemptuous dismission  Belv  But suppose she should take a fancy to your knapsack  Beauch  That would reduce  me  to the necessity of depriving  myself  of a happiness I would die to obtain for  never can I submit to be quartered on a Wife's fortune whilst I have a sword to carve subsistence for myself  Belv  That may be in the  great  stile but 'tis scarcely in the  polite  Will you take chocolate in my dressingroom  Beauch  No I am going to take orders at my Colonel's where shall we meet in the evening  Belv  'Faith 'tis impossible to tell I commit myself to Chance for the remainder of the day and shall finish it as she directs  Exeunt at opposite sides  Scene changes to an Apartment at  CLARINDA'S  Enter  CLARINDA  reading a Catalogue followed by  TIFFANY  Clar  Poor Lady Squander So Christie has her jewels and furniture at lastI must go to the saleMark that Dresden service and the pearls  Gives the catalogue to the Maid  It must be a great comfort to her to see her jewels worn by her friendsWho was here last night  sitting down and taking some cards from the table  I came home so late I forgot to enquireMrs  Jessamy  Lady  Racket  Miss  Belvoir  Lord  Sparkle starting up  Lord  Sparkle  here Oh Heavens and earth what possessed me to go to Lady  Price  's I wish she and her concert of three fiddles and a flute had been playing to her kids on the We  ch mountainsWhy did you persuade me to go out last night  Tiff  Dear ma'am you seem'd so lowspirited that I thought  Clar  I missed him every whereAt four places he was just gone as I came inBut what does it signify'Twas Lady  Bell Bloomer  he was seeking I dare swearhis attachment to the  relict  is every where the subject Hang those widows I really believe there's something cabalistical in their namesNo less than fourteen fine young fellows of fortune have been drawn into the matrimonial noose by them since last February'Tis well they were threatened with imprisonment or we should not have had an unmarried Infant above seventeen between CharingCross and PortmanSquare  Tiff  Well I am sure I wish Lady  Bell  was married she's always putting you out of temper  Clar  Have I not cause Till she broke upon the Town I was at the top of fashionyou know I was My dress my equipage my furniture and myself were the criterions  of taste but a new French chambermaid enabled her Ladyship at one stroke to turn the tide against me  Tiff  Ay I don't know what good these Mademoiselles  Clar  interrupting  But  Tiffany  she is to be at court today out of mourning for the first time I am resolved to be thereNo I won't go neither now I think on'tIf she shou'd really outshine me her triumph will be increased by my being witness to itI won't go to St James's but I'll go to her route this evening and if 'tis possible prevent Lord  Sparkle  's being particular to herPerhaps that will put her in an ill humour and then the advantage will be on my side  Exit  Clarinda  Tiff  Mercy on us To be a chambermaid to a  Miss  on the brink of Thirty requires as good politics as being Prime Minister Now if she should not rise from her toilette quite in looks today or if the desertion of a lover or the victory of a rival should happen ten to one but I shall be forced to resign without even a Pension to retire on  Exit  Tiffany  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  An elegant Apartment at  LADY BELL BLOOMER'S  Enter  JULIA  with Papers in her Hand  Julia  WHAT an invaluable treasure Those dear papers that have lain within the frigid walls of a Convent insensible and uninteresting to every one around them contain for  me  a world of happiness He is in England How little he suspects that  I  too am here  Enter  KITTY  Kitty  Mr  Fitzherbert  will be here immediately Ma'am  Julia  Mr  Fitzherbert  Very well Has Lady  Bell  finished dressing yet  Kitty  speaking exceedingly fast  No Ma'amMr  Crape  the hairdresser has been with her these three hours and her maid is running here and there and Mr  John  flying about to milliners and perfumers and the new  visàvis  at the door to carry her Ladyship to courtEvery thing black banished and the liveries come home shining with silver and the moment she is gone out every body will be in such a delightful hurry about the route that her Ladyship is to give this evening and they say all the world  Julia  Ha ha ha Prithee stop I can't wonder if Lady  Bell  shou'd be transported at dropping her weeds for it seems to have turn'd the heads of the whole family  Kitty  Oh dearee Ma'am to be sure for now we shall be so gay Lady  Bell  has such fine spiritsAnd 'tis well she has for the servants tell me their old master would have broke her heart elseThey all adore herI wish you were a little gayer Ma'amSomehow we are so dull'Tis a wonder so young and so pretty a Lady  Julia  Don't run into impertinenceI have neither the taste nor talents for public life that Lady  Bell Bloomer  has  Kitty  Laws Ma'am 'tis all use  You  are always at home but Lady  Bell  knows that wit and a fine person are not given for a fireside  at home  drawling  She shines every  evening in half the houses of halfadozen parishes and he next morning we have stanzas in the  Bevy of Beauties  and sonnets and billetsdoux and all the fine things that fine Ladies are so fond of  Julia  I can bear your freedoms no longerCarry these flowers with my compliments and tell her Ladyship I sent to Richmond for them as I know her fondness for natural bouquets and bid Harry deny me to every body this morning except Mr  Fitzherbert  Exit  Kitty  Enter Mr  FITZHERBERT  Fitz  Happily excepted my dear Ward But I suppose you heard my step and threw in my name for a douceur I can hardly believe that when you shut your doors on youth and flattery you would open them to a cross old man who seldom entertains you with any thing but your faults  Julia  How you mistake Sir You are the greatest flatterer I have your whole conduct flatters me with esteem and love and as you do not  squander  these things  smiling  Fitz  There I must correct youI do squander them on few objects indeed and they are proportionably warmer I feel àttachments fifty times as strong as your goodhumour'd smiling people who are every one's humble servant and every body's friend Where is Lady  Bell  Julia  Yet at her toilette I believe My dear Sir I am every hour more grateful to you for having given me so charming a friend  Fitz  So I would have you When you came from France I prevailed on her Ladyship to allow you her society that you might add to the polish of elegant manners the graces of an elegant mind Here she comes her tongue and her heels keeping time  Enter Lady  BELL  Ay ay if all the women in the world were prating young widows love and gallantry would die away and our men grow  reasonable  and  discreet  Lady Bell  Oh you monster But I am in such divine spirits that nothing you say can destroy 'emMy sweet  Julia  what a bouquet Lady Myrtle will expireShe was so envelop'd in flowers and evergreens last night that she look'd like the picture of fair Rosamond in her bowerMy dear  Fitz  do you know we dined yesterday in Hillstreet and had the fortitude to stay till eleven  Julia  I was tired to death with the fatiguing visit  Lady Bell  Now I on the contrary came away with fresh relish for society The persevering civility of Sir Andrew and the maukish insipidity of his tall daughter act like olives You can't endure them on your palate but they heighten the gusto of your Tokay  Fitz  Then I advise your Ladyship to serve up Sir Andrew and his daughter at your next entertainment  Lady Bell  So I would only one can't remove 'em with the dessert But how do you like me Did you ever see so delightful a head Don't you think I shall make a thousand conquests today  Fitz  Doubtless if you meet with so many foolsBut pray which of those you have already made will be the most flattered by all these gay insignia of your liberty  Lady Bell  Probably he whom it least concerns  Julia  Pray tell us which is that  Lady  Bell  Oh Heavens to answer that requires more reflection than I have ever given the subject  Julia  Should you build a temple to your lovers I fancy we should find Lord  Sparkle  's name on the altar  Lady Bell  Oh Lord  Sparkle  Who can resist the gay the elegant the allconquering Lord  Sparkle  the most distinguished feather in the plume of fashionwithout that barbarous strength of mind which gives importance to virtues or to vices Fashionable because he's well drestBrilliant because he's of the first Clubs and uses his borrowed wit like his borrowed gold as tho' it was his own  Fitz  Why now this man whom you understand so well you receive as tho' his tinsel was pure gold  Lady Bell  Aye to be sureTinsel is just as well for shewThe world is charitable and accepts tinsel for gold in most cases  Fitz  But in the midst of all this sunshine for Lord  Sparkle  will you not throw a ray on the spirited modest  Beauchamp  Lady Bell  A ray of favour for  Beauchamp  Were I so inclined to make it welcome I must change my fan for a spear my feathers for a helmet and stand forth a ThalestrisYou know  his  mistress is War  sighing and then recovering  But why do I trifle thusThe hour of triumph is at hand  Fitz  Of what  Lady Bell  The moment of triumph  Anglice  the moment when having shewn myself at half the houses in St George's I am set down at St James's my fellows standing on each hand as I descendthe whisper flying thro' the croud  "Who is she Who is that sweet creatureOne of the four heiresses""No she's a foreign ambassadress"  I ascend the stairsmove slowly thro' the roomsdrop my fanincommode my bouquetstay to adjust it that the  little  gentry may have time to fix their admirationagain move onenter the Drawingroomthrow a flying glance round the Circle and see nothing but spite in the eyes of the women and a thousand nameless things in those of the men  Julia  The very soul of giddiness  Lady Bell  The very soul of happinessCan I be lessThink of a widow just emerg'd from her weeds for a husband to whom her  sather  not her  heart  united hermy jointure elegantmy figure charmingdeny it if you darePleasure Fortune Youth Health all opening their stores before me whilst Innocence and conscious Honour shall be my handmaids and guide me in safety through the dangerous ordeal  Fitz  To your Innocence and conscious Honour add if you have time  archly  a little Prudence or your centinels may be surpris'd asleep and you reduc'd to a disgraceful capitulation  Lady Bell  Oh I'm mistress of my whole situation and cannot be surpris'dBut Heav'ns I am losing a conquest every moment I stayThe Loves and Pleasures have prepared their rosy garlandsmy triumphal car is waitingand  y proud steeds neighing to be goneAway to victory  Exit with great spirit  Fitz  A charming woman  Julia  She conceals a fine understanding under apparent giddiness and a most sensible heart beneath an air of indifference  Julia  Yes I believe her Ladyship's heart is more sensible than she allows to herself I rally her on Lord  Sparkle  but it is  Mr  Beauchamp  whose name is never mentioned but her cheeks tell such blushing truths as she wou'd never forgive me for observing  Fitz  Upon my word you seem well acquainted with your friend's heartWill you be equally frank as to your own  Julia  in great confusion  Sirmy heart  Fitz  Yes will you assist me in reading it  Julia  To be sure Sir  Fitz  Then tell me if amongst the painted powdered gilded moths whom your beauty or fortune have allured is there  one  whom you would honour with your handAye take time I would not have you precipitate  Julia  hesitatingly  No Sirnot one  Fitz  I depend on your truth and on that assurance inform you that a friend of mine is arriv'd in town whom I mean this morning to present to you  Julia  As a  Fitz  As a lover who has my warmest wishes that he may become your husband  Julia  Do I know the person for whom you are thus interested Sir  Fitz  You do not but I have had long intimacy with him and 'tis the dearest wish of my heart to see him and  Julia Manners  united  Julia  I trust Sir you will allow  Fitz  Be under no apprehensionsMuch as I'm interested in this union your inclinations shall be attended toI am now going to your lover and shall introduce him to you this morningCome don't look so distress'd child at the approach of that period which will give you  dignity  and  character  in societyThe marriagestate is that in which your sex evinces its importance and where in the interesting circle of domestic duties a woman has room to exercise every virtue that constitutes the Great and the Amiable  Exit  Fitzherbert  Julia  The moment I so much dreaded is arrived How shall I reveal to my Guardian and to Lady  Bell  that I  am  married that I have already dared to take on me those important duties I must not reveal itmy solemn promise to my husbandBut where is heOh I must write to him this moment that I may not be left defenceless to brave the storm of offended authority and love  Exit  Julia  SCENE II  BELVILLE's  Lodgings  Enter  BELVILLE  newdrest  Belv  Let my trunks be ready and the chaise at the door tomorrow morning by six for I shall dine in Dover  Fitz  Ha just in time I seeYou are ready plumed for flight  Belv  True but my flight wou'd have been to youImpatient to know the cause of your summoning me from the Dryades and Hamadryades of Berkshire your letter reach'd me at the very instant I was setting out for Dover in my way to Paris  Fitz  Paris  Belv  Yes  Fetz  Poh poh stay where you are stay where you are The great turnpike between Dover and Calais is a road destructive to this kingdom and I wish there were tollgates erected on its confines to restrain with a  heavy tax  the number of its travellers  Belv  I fear the  tax  would be more generally felt than the  benefit  for it would restrain not only the follymongers and the fashionmongers but the rational enquirer and the travelling connoisseur  Fitz  So much the better so much the betterOur travelling philosophers have done more towards destroying the nerves of their country than all the politics of France Their chief aim seems to be to establish infidelity and to captivate us with delusive views of manners still more immoral and licentious than our ownHeydey who's thisOh the Cornish lad I suppose whom Lord  Sparkle  placed here  Belv  laughing  Yes an odd beingHe was designed by nature for a Clodpole but the notice of a Peer overset the little understanding he had and so he commenced fine gentleman He has a sister with him who ran wild upon the commons till her father's death but she fancies herself a wit and satirizes BruinHere he comes  Enter  PENDRAGON  Pen  My dear fellowlodger I'm come toOh your servant Sir  to  Fitzherbert  Is this gentleman a friend of yours  Belv  He is  Pen  Your hand Sir  passes  Belville  and stands between them  If you are Mr  Belville  's friend you are my friend and we are all friends I soon make acquaintance  Fitz  A great happiness  Pen  Yes so it is and very polite too I have been in the Great World almost six weeks and I can see no difference between the Great World and the Little World only that they've no ceremony and so as that's the mark of goodbreeding I tries to hit it off  Fitz  With success  Pen  To convince you of that I'll tell you a devilish good thingYou must know  Fitz  interrupting  Excuse me now but I am convinc'd you will amuse me and desire your company at dinnerthey'll give you my address below Mr  Belville  I have business of importance  Exit  Fitzherbert  and  Belville  Pen  Gad I'm glad he ask'd me to visit himHe must be a Lord by his want of ceremony  imitating  "Mr  Belville  I have business of importance"and off they goNow in Cornwall we should have thought that damn'd rudebut 'tis easy"Mr  Belville  I have business of importance"  going  Easyeasyeasy  Enter  SOPHY PENDRAGON  Sophy  Brother  Bobby  Brother  Bobby  Pen  returning  I desire Miss  Pendragon  you won't  Brother  me at this ratemaking one look as if one didn't know LifeHow often shall I tell you that it is the most ungenteel thing in the world for relations to  Brother  and  Father  and  Cousin  one another and all that sort of thing I did not get the better of my shame for three days when you bawl'd out to Mrs Dobson at Launceston Concert"Aunt Aunt here's room between Brother and I if Cousin Dick will sit closer to Father"  Sophy  Lackadayand where's the harm What d'ye think one has relations given one forTo be asham'd of 'em  Pen  I don't know what they were given us for but I know no young man of fashion  cares  for his relations  Sophy  More shame for your young men of fashion but I assure you Brother  Bobby  I shall never give in to any such unnatural newfangled ways As for you since Lord  Sparkle  took notice of you you are quite another  thing You used to creep into the parlour when Father had company hanging your head like a dead partridge steal all round the room behind their backs to get at a chair then sit down on one corner of it tying knots in your handkerchief and if anybody drank your health rise up and scrape your foot so"Thank you kindly Sir"  Pen  By Goles if you  shaking his fist  Sophy  But now when you enter a room your hat is toss'd carelessly on a table you pass the company with a half bend of your body fling yourself into one chair and throw your legs on another"Pray my dear Sir do me the favour to ring""John bring Lemonade""Mrs Plume has been driving me all morning in HydePark against the wind and the dust has made my throat mere plaister of Paris"  Pen  Hang me if I don't like myself at secondhand better than I thought I shouldWhy if I do it as well as you  Sophy  I shall soon be quite the thingAnd now I'll give you a bit of adviceAs 'tis very certain Lord  Sparkle  means to introduce you to High Life 'tis sitting you should know how to behave and as I have been amongst 'em I can tell you  Sophy  Well  Pen  Why first of all if you should come into a drawingroom and find twenty or thirty people in the circle you are not to take the least notice of any one  Sophy  No  Pen  NoThe servant will perhaps give you a chairif not slide into the nearest The conversation will not be interrupted by your entrance for they'll take as little notice of you as you of them  Sophy  Psha  Pen  Then be sure to be equally indifferent to the comingin of othersI saw poor Lady Carmine one night dying with confusion for the vulgarity and illbreeding of her friend who actually rose from her chair at the entrance of the Dutchess of Dulcet and Lady Betty Blowze  Sophy  Be quiet  Bobby  Pen  True as I am a young man of fashionThen you must never let your discourse go beyond one wordIf any body should happen to take the trouble to entertain the company you may throw in"CharmingOdious  Capital"Never mount to a phrase unless to that dear delightful one of "all that sort of thing"The use made of that is wonderful  "All that sort of thing"  is an apology for want of wit it is a substitute for argument it will serve for the point of a story or the fate of a battle  Sophy  Well thenupon going away  Pen  Oh you go away as you came inIf one has a mind to give the lady of the house a nod  nodding  one may but 'tis still higher breeding to leave  her  with as little ceremony as  I  do you  Exit  Pendragon  without looking at her  Sophy  I wish I could be sure it was the fashion not to mind forms I'd go directly and visit Lord  Sparkle  I could tear my eyes out to think I was abroad today when he call'd on Mrs  Johnson  In all the books I have read I never met with a lover so careless as he isSometimes I have a mind to treat him with disdain and then I recollect all I have read about Ladies behaviour that break their Lovers heartsbut he won't come near meNow I have been three days in a complying humourbut 'tis all one still he keeps away I'll be

 Belv  Where  In France  When  About eight months since  How  By an English clergyman  With whom  Ah with such a oneHer beauty is of the Greek kind which pleases the mind more than the eyeYet to the eye nothing can be more lovelyTo this charming creature add the name of  Julia Manners  and you know my wife  Fitz  Julia Manners Julia Manners  did you say  Belv  Yes  Julia Manners  I first knew her at the house of a friend in Paris whose daughters were in the same convent with herself I often visited her at the grate at length by the assistance of Mademoiselle St Val prevailed on her to give me her hand but was immediately torn from her by a summons from my uncle at Florence whence I was dispatched to England on a ministerial affair  Fitz  So so so very fine  aside  I suppose you had the prudence to make yourself acquainted with the Lady's family before you married her  Belv  Yes her family and fortune are elegant She has a guardian whese address the sweet Obstinate refused to give me that she might herself reveal the marriagewhich I had reasons however to request her not to do till we both arrived in England  Fitz  Then you have not seen your bride in England  Belv  Oh noMy  Julia  is yet in her convent I have been preparing for her reception in Berkshire and have written to inform her that I would meet her at Calais but I fear my letters have missed her and shall therefore set out  for Paris to conduct to England the woman who must give the point to all my felicities  Fitz  aside  And has  Julia  been capable of thisUngrateful girl is it thus she rewards my cares  Belv  Your silence and your resentment my dear friend whilst they flatter distress me  Fitz  I'm indeed offended at your marriage but not with youon  you  I had no claims  Belv  I do not apprehend you  Fitz  Perhaps not and at present I shall not explain myself  going  Belv  If you  will  leave me adieu I am going to run over the Town My mind impatient for the moment which carries me to my sweet bride feels all the intermediate time a void which any adventure may fill up  Exit  Fitz  Spite of my displeasure I can hardly conceal from him his happinessYet I  willJulia  must be punished To vice and folly I am content to appear severe but  she  ought not to have thought me so I have not deserved this want of confidence and must correct it If I don't mistake  Pendragon  is a fit instrumentI'll

can pick up any stories of extravagance and gallantry affix my name to 'em and repeat them to your mistress  Kitty  Then she'll tell 'em to Lady  Bell  perhaps for a warning  Spark  drawling  For a warning quothaMy devoirs to Lady  Bell  are of a different kind and we understand each other I address  her  for a wife because she's the fashion and I address  Julia  for a mistress because 'tis the

deduction  Spark  Now she has a friend whom I mean at the same time to take for a mistresswon't that be a stroke eh  Belv  Decidedly Your life is made up of strokes Every thing with you my Lord is a hit  Spark  True true I detest a regular mechanical mode of doing thingsMen of sense have one way of getting through life men of genius another  Belv  Doubtless and the advantage lies with the men of genius for to their  genius  are all their faults imputed nay their faults are considered as the graceful meanderings of a mind  too ethereal  to be confined to the rules of commonsense and decoruma mighty easy way of building reputation ha ha ha You are drest with infinite malice today my Lord  Spark  Malice Not at allThe women nowadays are neither caught by finery or personI am drest for courtI

never blush againWill you go  Belv  'Tis too late to dress besides I have devoted this day to adventure I am rambling through the town discovering what new stars have appeared in the Galaxy of Beauty during my absence and a dangerous progress it is The rays of a pair of black eyes from a chariot in Pallmall would have annihilated me had not at the same instant two beautiful blue ones from a window given a fillip to my sinking spirits A fineturn'd ancle whose polish shone thro' its neat silk stocking encounter'd me in St James'sstreet but I was luckily relieved by a little rosy mouth that betray'd with a deceitful smile teeth most murderously white A Galatea darted by me on the right whilst a Helen swam along on the leftin short from such sweet besiegers nothing could have preserved me

revenge on her disobedience before I acquaint her with the felicity that attends her Come in Young Cornish pray  Enter  PENDRAGON  Pen  What does the Lady live in this fine house  Fitz  Yesbut pray observe that I don't engage she shall be  smitten  with you I can go no farther than to introduce you the rest must depend on the brilliancy of your manners  Pen  Oh leave me alone for thatI knew how 'twould be if I once shew'd myself in London If she has a long purse I'll whask her down to Cornwall jockey Lord  Sparkle  and have the Borough myself  Fitz  A man of spirit I see  Pen  Oh as to my spirit that nobody ever doubtedI have beat our Exciseman and gone tolaw with the Parson and to shew you that I did not leave my spirit in the  country since I came to London I have fined a hackneycoachman for abuse  Fitz  Very commendableBut here comes the Lady  Enter  JULIA  Mr  Pendragon  this is my ward who I am sure will give your addresses all the encouragement I wish them  Pen  Servant Ma'am  aside  She looks plaguy glum  Julia  I can scarcely support myself  aside  Fitz  Pray my dear speak to Mr  Pendragon  You seem greatly confused  Pen  Oh Sir I understand it Young Ladies will look confus'd and embarrass'd and all that sort of thing on these occasions but we men of the world are up to all that  Julia  Heavens is it to such a Being I should have been sacrificed  aside  Pen  I see your ward is one of the modest diffident ones I am surprised at thatbred in highlife  Fitz  Oh now and then you find a person of that cast in the best companybut they soon get over it  Pen  Yes formerly I used to blush and be modest and all that sort of thing but if any one ever catches me modest again I'll give 'em my estate for a pilchard  Julia  Then it seems impossiblepardon me Sir  to  Fitzherbert  that a union can take place between you and me for I place modesty amongst the  elegancies  of manner and think it absolutely necessary to the character of a gentleman  Fitz  Well done  Julia  aside  Fye upon you to treat my friend with such asperity  Pen  O leave her to me Sir she's ignorant but I shall  teach  her There are three things Miss only necessary to the character of a Gentlemana good air good assurance and good teeth  grinning  Julia  to  Fitzherbert  Doesn't his list want  good manners  Sir  Pen  Oh no Ma'am If you had said good  taste  it wou'd have been nearer the thing but even that is unnecessaryA Gentleman's friends can furnish his house and chuse his books and his pictures and he can learn to criticise them by heartNothing is so easy as to criticisepeople do it continually  Fitz  You see Mr  Pendragon  has  information Julia  I'll leave you a few moments that he may unfold himself to advantage and remember if you refuse the man I design for your husband you lose  me  Keep it up with spirit I'll wait for you below  to  Pendragon  Now shall impertinence and disobedience correct each other  Exit  Fitzherbert  Pen  Now to strike her with my superior  ease  aside  So Miss your Guardian I think has a mind that we shallin the vulgar speechmarry  Julia  Well Sir but are you not frighten'd at your approach to such a stateDo you know what belongs to the character of a Husband  Pen  What belongs to it Aye Do you know what belongs to being a Wife  Julia  Yes I guess that to  your  wife will belong illhumour with you at homeshame with you abroadin her face forc'd smilesin her heart hidden thorns  Pen  The Devil What you have found your tongue Ma'am Oh oh I shall have a fine time on't I guess when our  connection  begins  Julia  Our  connectionPray Sir drop the ideaI protest to you that were it possible for me to become your wife I should be the most wretched of women  Pen  Oh no you woudn't I hardly know a wife who is  not  wretched  Julia  Unfeeling man Would  you  presume to enter into a state to the happiness of which union of soul delicacy of sentiment and all the elegant attentions of polish'd manners are necessary and indispensible  Pen  What's all that Union of soul sentiment attentionsThat's not Life I'm sure  Julia  I am not able to conceive by what witchcraft Mr  Fitzherbert  has been blinded to the weakness of your head and the turpitude of your heartTell him Sir there is not a fate I would not prefer to that of being united to a man whose vice is the effect of folly and whose folly is as hateful even as his vice  Exit  Julia  Pen  Yes yes I'll tell depend on'tEgad she's a spiritSo much the better more pleasure in taming herA meek wife cheats a man of his rights and deprives him of the pleasure of  exacting  her obedienceLet me seeVicefollyimpudenceignoranceIgnorance too  Exit  Pendragon  Reenter  JULIA  Julia  What have I done I dare not now see my guardian His displeasure will kill me Oh  Belville  where art thou Come and shield thy unhappy brideWhat steps can I take  Enter  KITTY  Kitty  Dear Ma'am I'm so griev'd to see you so unhappy If I had such a cross old guardian I'd run away from him  Julia  The very thought which that instant presented itself to my mindHave you not told me that some relation of your's has lodgings  Kity  Yes Ma'am the most elegantest in London  Julia  I don't want elegant apartments but I wish for a short time to be conceal'd in some family of reputation  Kitty  To be sure Ma'am 'tis the most prudent thing you can do  Julia  And yet my heart fails me  Kitty  Oh Ma'am don't hesitate I'll go and pack up a few things and call a coach and be off before Lady  Bell  comes from Court  Julia  I fear 'tis a wrong step and yet what other can I take I dare not reveal my marriage without the permission of my husband and till his arrival I must avoid both a guardian's anger and the addresses of a loverThe honour of  Belville  would be insulted should I permit them to be repeated  aside  Exit Julia  Kitty  I know not what she means but there is some mystery I find So there shou'd beIf ladies had not mysteries a chambermaid's place would be hardly worth keepingI have mysteries too and she shall have their explanation from Lord  Sparkle  Exit  SCENE III  CLARINDA'S  House  Enter Lady  BELL  meeting  CLARINDA  L Bell  Ha ha ha my dear

dexterity entangled the traces It happen'd near your door so I have taken shelter with you and left her Ladyship to settle the dispute with my coachman ha ha ha But why were you not at Court today  Clar  I had a teazing headach but pray tell me what happen'd there  aside  Deuce take her she looks as well as ever  L Bell  Oh the Ladies as usual brilliantnothing so flat as the men The horrid  English  custom ruins them for conversation They make themselves members of Clubs in the way of business and Members of Parliament in the way of amusement all their passions are reserved for the first and all their wit for the last  Clar  'Tis better in Paris  L Bell  Oh 'tis quite another thing Whilst we aukwardly copy the follies of the Parisians we absurdly omit the charming part of their character Devoted to elegance they catch their opinions their wit and their bons mots from the mouths of the ladies'Tis in the drawingroom of Madame the Dutchess the Marquis learns his politicks whilst the sprightly Countess dispenses taste and philosophy to a circle of Bishops Generals and Abbés  Clar  All that may be just yet I am mistaken if you have not found  one  Englishman to reconcile you to the manners of the rest Lord  Sparkle  for instanceyour Ladyship thinks I'm sure that  be  has wit at will  L Bell  Oh yes quite at willHis wit like his essencebottle is a collection of all that is poignant in a thousand flowers and like that is most useful when he himself is most insipidly vacant  Clar  With such sentiments I wonder you can suffer his addresses  L Bell  What  can  I do The man is so much the fashion and I shall be so much enviedWhy you now my dear for instanceyou'd be inclin'd to stick a poisoned nosegay in my bosom if I should take him  Clar  Ha ha ha ridiculous Believe me Madam I shall neither prepare a bouquet nor invoke a fiery shower to grace your nuptials  L Bell  aside  No your shower would be tears I fancyHere be comes  Clar  Hah Lord  Sparkle  Your Ladyship's accident was fortunate  sneering  Enter  LORD SPARKLE  Spark  Heavens Lady  Bell  your horses fly like the doves of Venus I follow'd you from St James'sbut my poor earthborn cattle wouldn't keep pace with yours  Clar  Oh don't complain If her Ladyship won the race you see she stopp'd for you at the goal  Spark  Charming Miss  Belmour  what an enliv'ning intimation Where was your Ladyship on Thursday You would have found excellent food for your satire at Mrs  Olio  's We had all the Law Ladies from Lincoln'sinn a dozen gold velvets from Bishopsgate with the wives and daughters of half the M D's and L L D's in town  L Bell  Oh my entertainment was quite as good as yours We were in Brookstreet at Lady  Laurel  's and found her surrounded by her Literati of all denominationsWe had Masters of Art and Misses of Scienceon one hand an Essayist on the other a Moralistthere a Poetaster here a Translatorin that corner a Philosopher in the oth r a Compiler of MagazinesTropes Epigrams and Syllogisms flew like skyrockets in every direction 'till the ambition of preeminence lighted the flame of controversy when they gave each other the  lye literary  with infinite spirit and decorum  Spark  Excellent I'll repeat every word in a place where it will be remember'd and the satire enjoy'd  Clar  In that hope your Lordship may safely knock at every door in the streetsatire is welcome every where  L Bell  Yes if it will bear a laughthat's the grand art of conversation They pretend we are fond of slander but rob scandal of its laugh and 'twould soon be banish'd to the second table for the amusement of butlers and chambermaids  Spark  Indeed Then I believe half our acquaintance wou'd go down stairs to the second table toothey'd think their servants had the best of the dish  Enter a  Servant  gives  Lord Sparkle  a letter and exit  Spark  reads it aside  Julia  astonishingSo sudden in your movements Mrs  Kitty  turning to the Ladies  This vulgar thing call'd business is

carriage  L Bell  If you pleaseMiss Belmour  "I must tear myself away"  but you'll shine upon us at night  Exeunt  L Sparkle  and  Lady Bell  Clar  Shine  upon you at nightThat I know you are insolent enough to believe impossibleWhat can I think of her sentiments for Lord  Sparkle  Sometimes I believe 'tis a mere attachment of vanity on both sidesThat reserv'd creature  Beauchamp  is in his confidence but he leaves town this very day and I shall have no opportunity of conversing with him  muses  There is but one chancegoing to visit himBut how can I possibly do that Deuce take him If he had a library one might go to look at his books Well I don't care go I will and if I can't invent an excuse I'll put a good face upon the matter and go without one  going  I should expire if my visit

Bell  Mr  Beauchamp  Here go and put some otto of roses in that handkerchief  Exit  Maid  Now shall I admit him or not This formal waiting looks very like formal business Poh I hate thatI suppose he has at length vanquish'd his modesty and is come to tell me thatthatWell I vow I won't hear himYes I will I long to know the stile in which these reserv'd men make loveTo what imprudence would my heart betray me Yet I may surely indulge myself in hearing him  speak  of love in hearing probably for the first time its genuine language  Enter  Maid  and presents the handkerchief  Tell Mr  Beauchamp  I am here  Exit  Maid  Now how shall I receive him It will be intolerable to be formal  Takes her fan from her pocket and traverses the stage humming a tuneEnter  Beauchamp  Oh Mr  Beauchamp  this is the luckiest thingI have had ten disputes today about the figures in my fan and you shall decide 'em Is that beautiful nymph a flying Daphne or an Atalanta  Beauch  looking at her fan  From the terror of the eye Madam and the swiftness of her step it must be a Dephne I think Atalanta's head would be more at variance with her feet and whilst she  flies  her eye would be invitingly turn'd on her pursuers  L Bell  I think you are rightYesthere does want the kind inviting glance to be sure  Beauch  What a misfortune to a lover I know one to whom your Ladyship appears the disdainful DaphneHow happy could he behold in  your  eye the encouragement of Atalanta's  L Bell  aside  Mercy for so bashful a man that's pretty plain  Beauch  This is probably the last visit I can make you before I leave Englandwill your Ladyship permit me  before  I leave it to acquaint you that there is a man whose happiness depends on your favour  agitated  L Bell  So now he's going to be perplexing again  aside  A man whose happiness depends on me Mr  Beauchamp  looking on her fan  Beauch  Yes Madamandand  aside  I cannot go onWhy did I accept a commission in which success would destroy me  L Bell  How evidently this is the first time he ever made love  aside  The man seems to have chosen a very diffident advocate in you Sir  Beauch  'Tis  more  than diffidence Madam my task is painful  L Bell  Ay I thought so You have taken a brief in a cause you don't like I could plead it better myself  Beauch  I feel the reproach  L Bell  'Tis difficult for you perhaps to speak in the  third  personTry it in the  first  Suppose now ha ha only suppose I say for the jest's sake that you yourself have a passion for me and  then  tryhow you can plead it  Beauch  kneeling  Thusthus would I plead it and swear that thou art dear to my heart as fame and honourTo look at thee is rapture to love thee tho' without hopefelicity  L Bell  Oh I thought I should bring him to the point at

mebut 'tis not Lord  Sparkle  Tell him soand tell him thatthattell him what you will  Beauch  Heavens what does she mean What language is this her eye speaks  aside  L Bell  Do  you  visit me this evening Here will be many of my friends and you shall then see me in the presence of the man my heart prefers  Beauchamp  bows and goes to the door then returns advances towards Lady  Bell  makes an effort to speak finds it impossible then bows and exit  Heavens what necessity have lovers for words What persuasion in that bashful irresolution Now shall I let him quit England or notWhat give up a

of my friend  Beauchamp  with a sense of obligation you had neither spirit or justice to confer  Lady Bell  A Commission my Lord which was sent Mr  Beauchamp  under a blank cover by one who could not bear to see his noble spirit dependent on your caprices  Belv  And when his sentiments pointed out your Lordship as his benefactor you accepted the honour and have laid heavy taxes on his gratitude  Spark  Well and what is there in all that  Beauchamp  did not know to whom he was obliged and wou'dn't it have been a most unchristian thing to let a good action run about the world belonging to

are not to be trifled with Once already the hopes you have inspir'd  Lady Bell  The hour of  trifling  is past and surely it cannot appear extraordinary that I prefer the internal worth of an uncorrupted heart to the outward polish of a mind too feeble to support itself against vice in the seductive forms of fashionable dissipation  Spark  Heydey what is your Ladyship in the plot  Fitz  The plot has been deeper laid than you my Lord have been able to conceive As I have the misfortune to be related to you I thought it my duty to watch over your conduct I have seen your plans which generally tended to your confusion and disgrace and many of them have been defeated tho' you knew not by what means But what fate does your Lordship design for these young people decoy'd by you from their native ignorance and home  Spark  Let them return to their native ignorance and home as fast as they can  Pend  No no hang me if I do thatI know Life now and Life I'll haveHydePark Plays Operas

you shall be taken care of but the requisites of a soldier are not those of pertness and assurance Intrepid spirit nice honour generosity and understanding all unite to form himIt is these which will make a British soldier once again the first character in EuropeIt is such soldiers who must make England once again invincible and her glittering arms triumphant in every quarter of the globe  Sophy

in adopting you  Lady Bell  interrupting  Oh I protest against thatOur union would then appear a prudent sober business and I should lose the credit of having done a mad thing for the sake of the manmy heart prefers  Fitz  To you I resign him with pleasure his fate is in your hands  Lady Bell  Then he shall continue a soldierone of those whom Love and his Country detain to guard her dearest  last  possessions  Beauch  Love and my Country Yes ye shall divide my heartAnimated by such passions our forefathers were invincible and if we wou'd preserve the freedom and independence they obtain'd
