 MAYDAY OR THE LITTLE GIPSY  Price OneShilling  MAYDAY OR THE LITTLE GIPSY A MUSICAL FARCE OF ONE ACT  TO WHICH IS ADDED THE THEATRICAL CANDIDATES A MUSICAL PRELUDE  AS THEY ARE BOTH PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL in DRURYLANE  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author of this Musical Farce begs leave to inform the readers if there should be any that it was merely intended to introduce the  Little Gipsy  to the public whose youth and total inexperience of the stage made it necessary to give as little dialogue to her character as possible her success depending wholly upon her singingThis reason added to another which is that the piece was produced at an early part of the season when better writers are not willing to come forth is the best apology the Author can make for its defects  Dramatis Personae  MEN  FURROW  a rich farmer  Mr PARSONS  WILLIAM  his son  Mr VERNON  CLOD  his servant  Mr BANNISTER  DOZEY  Mr WESTON  CRYER  Mr

Yes his liking went much beyond my expectation  or your wishes In a week he fell in love with her and is at this time a very dangerous rival  WM  I am sure to have some mischief happen in all my schemes  DOL  Her singing and twenty little agreeable fooleries she puts on have bewitch'd him Her mimiking the Gipsies has so inchanted him that he has prevailed upon her to come to the Maypole today among the holiday lads and lasses and tell their fortunes She has dress'd up herself often and been among 'em without their knowing who she isin short she has bewitch'd the whole villageI am to be there too as her motherMy father will have it so  WM  So much the better while you are telling fortunes I may talk to her without being observ'd send but a fortuneteller or a mountebank among country people and they have no eyes and ears for any thing else Where is my father now  DOL  Upon some knotty point with Roger Dozey the clerkI must go and prepare for the frolick don't be melancholy Will the worst that can happen is to marry the girl without your father's consent turn gipsy with your wife and send your children to steal his poultry  WM  But harkee Dolly who is to have Mr Goodwill's Mayday legacy A hundred pounds is a tolerable foundation to build uponWhat is become of George Dolly  DOL  I have not time to tell youHe is a rogue like the rest of you But as I have a heart that can make an honest man happy that possesses it so it has a spirit within it to despise a knave or a coxcomb  Would women do as I do  With spirit scorn dejection  The men no arts could fly to  They'd keep 'em in subjection  But if we sigh or simper  The lovesick farce is over  They'll bring us soon to whimper  And then good night the lover  Would women do as I do  No knaves or fools could cheat 'em  They'd passion bid good bye to  And trick for trick would meet 'em  But if we sigh or simper  The lovesick farce is over  They'll bring us soon to whimper  And then good night the lover  WM  Well said
