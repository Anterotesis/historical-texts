 ATHELSTAN A TRAGEDY As it is ACTED at the THEATRE ROYAL in  DruryLane  LONDON Printed for LOCKYER DAVIS and CHARLES REYMERS against  GraysInnGate Holbourn  And at  Lord Bacon's Head  in  FleetStreet  MDCCLVI Price One Shilling and Sixpence  IL ne faut pourtant pas croire que les Grecs manquent de Feu Tout s'anime au contraire tout parle tout agit dans leurs Ecrits Mais c'est plus l'Action le Spectacle que les Paroles plus la Passion le Sentiment que le Discours au lieu que les François ont souvent donné dans le Discours les Paroles pour suppleer au Spectacle ou à la Passion Combien de Portraits de Sentences de Lieux communs bien frappés ont arraché des Applaudissemens qui devoient être réservés à l'emotion Theatrale qu'on ne sentoit pas ce n'est que le sang froid qui applaudit à la Beauté des Vers dans un Spectacle  BRUMOY  Theat des Grecs  TO HIS GRACE The Duke of DEVONSHIRE Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland  My LORD  IT was the frequent Practice of the ancient  Greek  Tragedians to make their Compositions for the  Theatre  subservient to the Welfare of the  State  The Legislator's Wisdom was inforced by the Poet's Art Public Guilt was stigmatized and public Virtue applauded Of this Kind somewhat is or ought to be shadowed out in the following Tragedy  But it may possibly be asked  "Why this Address from a Writer who is and determines to remain unknown"  My LORD it comes from one who altho' he hath not wanted Opportunities hath ever scorned to prostitute Addresses of this Kind to Views of Interest But if it hath for once happened in his Time that Virtue and Power are eminently united his honest Disdain of offering Incense to the  one  shall not intimidate him from avowing his Reverence of the  other  More especially the natural Relation which the Design of this Tragedy bears to your Grace's Conduct gives its Author a kind of equitable Title without Leave to prefix your Name Thus while he delineates  Rebellion  he contrasts it with true  Loyalty  And to an  Example  of  Sedition  drawn from ancient Days  opposes  a  Character  from modern Life who in the highest Station and most perilous Times hath been the  Restorer  of  Unity  and  Concord  I am My LORD with the highest Esteem your GRACE's most obedient Servant The AUTHOR  PROLOGUE  Written by the AUTHOR of the TRAGEDY  Spoken by Mr HOLLAND in the Character of the  Genius  of  Britain  TO warn the Sons of Freedom to be wise  Lo  Britain's  guardian Genius quits the Skies  With Pity Heav'n hath seen thro' many an Age  The bold Invader lur'd by Faction's Rage  Seen the dark Workings of Rebellion's Train  While Patriots plann'd and Heroes bled in vain  Behold your Country's faithless Foe once more  With threatning Squadrons crowd yon hostile Shore  Behold Oppression's bloody Flag unfurl'd  See Bolts prepar'd to chain the Western World  Rise  Britons  rise to Heav'n and Virtue true  Expiring Liberty looks up to  You  Pour on the common Foe your Rage combin'd  And be the Friends of Freedom and Mankind  No more let Discord  Britain  's Peace destroy  Nor spurn those Blessings Reason bids enjoy  Oh weigh those Blessings in her equal Scale  SayWhen did Justice wear a whiter Veil  When did Religion gentler Looks disclose  To bless her Friends and pity ev'n her Foes  A richer Harvest when did Commerce reap  When rode your Flects more dreadful o'er the Deep  Or when more bright hear  Envy  hear and own  Did Truth did Honour beam from  Britain  's Throne  Seize then the Happiness deny'd your Foes  Nor blindly scorn the Gifts which Heav'n bestows  Gifts the World's Envy happy  Britain  's Pride  For which your generous Fathers toil'd and dy'd  Let Union lift the Sword direct the Blow  And hurl a Nation's Vengeance on its Foe  As your bold Cliffs when Tides and Tempests roar  Fling back the mad'ning Billows from the Shore  One Head one Heart one Arm one People rise  Nor fall divided Valour's Sacrifice  But if by Hope of proud Invasion led  Unaw'd Rebellion lift her gory Head  Treason attendhere view the Rebel's Fate  Nor hope thy Arm can shake a freeborn State  See Blood and Horror end what Guilt began  And tremble at  thy  Woes in  Athelstan  The PERSONS  ENGLISH

HAROLD  _GOTHMUND a Warrior By our Gods of  Denmark  I cou'd have sack'd ten Cities since the Morn  The lingering Sun goes down and yet beholds  The  Danish  Sword hang pow'rless o'er the Foe  To him  DUNELM  DUNELM well metWhat means this vile Delay  What hast thou seen  DUNELM  From yonder Eminence  Ev'n now I saw proud  London  wrapt in Fire  HAROLD behold yon dusky Wreaths of Smoke  Yon pitchy Cloud is fraught with glorious Ruin  HAROLD  Indeed  DUNELM  I saw the Flames besiege the Tow'r  Which proudly had scorn'd the general Assault  Of  Denmark's  Pow'r Soon spread the sulphur'd Fires  Mining it's Base at length with horrid Crash  The Pile fell headlong like a Wreck of Nature  And as it fell a hollow Murmur pierc'd  Mine Ear that seem'd an Army's dying Groan  I saw the Breach in the proud City's Wall  Where our brave  Danes  pour'd in while Shouts of Conquest  Dismay'd the flying Rear HAROLD ere this  The City's won  HAROLD  No moreI'm sorry for't  DUNELM  What when our Troops thro' ten long Moons have toil'd  Till Siege and fell Disease have thin'd our Ranks  Before this Capital this haughty  London  The Mistress of the Island When her Tow'rs  Are humbled in the Dust ev'n then to wear  That clouded Eye Much it might suit a  Briton  But ill becomes a  Dane  HAROLD  Have I not Cause  To hate our General  DUNELM  Grant it yet no Cause  To hate the Victories his Sword hath gain'd  For  Denmark's  Weal  HAROLD  Dishonour blast his Laurels  Ere since I won full Glory from our Wars  He checks my Valour lest it should o'ertop  And shadow hisBehold this very Day  When mighty  London  falls a Prey to  Denmark  I'm pent within the Circuit of a Camp  On an obscure and ignominious Charge  My Sword inglorious sleeps within its Scabbard  Depriv'd its Prey Yes well he knew this Arm  Had led the Storm as erst it did to him  And his Compeers when  Norway's  frozen Cities  Sunk at my Frown when thro' conflicting Hosts  I op'd the dreadful Track while far behind  He loyter'd in the Breach and poorly reap'd  The Gleanings of my Faulcion  DUNELM  Peace brave HAROLD  Nor let Dissention blot the gen'ral Triumph  HAROLD  Here DUNELM here shall deep Revenge lie pent  Must'ring it's Rage but soon th' impatient Flood  Shall burst the Mound and overwhelm his Pride  Yes may I ne'er more win the Wreath of Conquest  Ne'er fall triumphant in the Field of Fame  But groan out Life stretch'd on th' unmanly Couch  If I repay not GOTHMUND's uncaus'd Hate  With deadliest Vengeance  DUNELM  Let thy Vengeance wait  Some darker HourBehold where GOODWIN comes  His Eye speaks Victory and his glad Step  Prevents the welcome Tidings of his Tongue  SCENE II  To them  GOODWIN  GOODWIN  Hail valiant HAROLD This great Day shall shine  In  Denmark's  Annals GOTHMUND sends thee greeting  With the glad News of  England's  Overthrow  Himself shall soon arrive  HAROLD  Brave GOODWIN welcome  More welcome for thy Tidings  London  then  England's  chief Boast is fall'n  GOODWIN  Ev'n now it burns  See yon ascending Clouds Yon pillar'd Smoke  That hides the Welkin is it's last Remain  The  English  Pow'rs have left the bleeding Ramparts  The wide Breach choak'd with Heaps of Slain on which  We mounted to the Storm  HAROLD  How went the Day  Where fought our Gen'ral GOTHMUND  GOODWIN  On the  Thames  Soon as the Signal of Assault was given  The  Danish  Fleet came on Our Standard then  The Raven hov'ring on his Wing appear'd  With ominous Glare and seem'd to croak Destruction  Then furious GOTHMUND from the crowded Decks  Follow'd by shouting Thousands leapt to Shore  With ruinous Assault  HAROLD  What no Resistance  GOODWIN  Yes bloody was the Fray The Scale of War  Hung doubtful till the mighty ATHELSTAN  Mercia's  brave Duke to  Denmark's  aid came on  Spur'd by a keen Revenge more strong than Glory  Led his revolted  Mercians  up the Breach  And mingled in the Storm  HAROLD  What next ensu'd  GOODWIN  Confusion and wild Rout For  England's  Pow'r  Dreading the vengeful Sword of ATHELSTAN  Shrunk from his Rage then  Denmark's  Star prevail'd  The  Britons  fled and now by Right of War  The City's Wealth it's captive Youth and Virgins  Are fall'n the Soldiers Plunder  HAROLD  It seems then GOTHMUND owes full half his Conquest  To ATHELSTAN's Revenge  GOODWIN  Aye more than half  Ne'er did such deadly Valour sweep the Field  His hoary Head clasp'd in a steel rib'd Helm  He sprung to Vengeance and forgot old Age  With such a headlong Course he led the War  That  Denmark's  Troops nay his own firey  Mercians  Linger'd behind while he attended only  By Death and Fate which at his right Hand rag'd  Thin'd the retreating Foe  HAROLD  Thank we the Gods  Who sow Dissention in these  British  Hearts  Else ne'er had this fair City fall'n our Prey  DUNELM  Know ye the Cause why this proud Duke of  Mercia  Revolted from his King  GOODWIN  Pride and Revenge  Some suit deny'd him which the royal Bounty  Unequal to the Cravings of it's People  Granted his Foe No more His firey Spirit  Mounted to sudden Rage with secret Levy  He muster'd all his Pow'rs and join'd with  Denmark  To overwhelm his Country  HAROLD  Be it ours  To nurse this useful Treason Thus invading  While we divide we conquer  DUNELM  Hark I hear  The Shouts of Victory  GOODWIN  GOTHMUND approaches  His Troops come laden with the precious Spoil  Of this imperial City Captive Maids  The sweet Reward of Valour grace his Triumph  And Infants doom'd to drink the bitter Draught  Of endless Slavery in a foreign Clime  SCENE III  To them  GOTHMUND  in Triumph A Train of Prisoners And  EGBERT  in Chains as a Prisoner  HAROLD  Hail valiant GOTHMUND  Denmark's  proudest Boast  Whom mighty ODIN the dread God of War  Hath crown'd with  England's  Conquest  GOTHMUND  Faithful HAROLD  The City's won  London  whose haughty Tow'rs  We shook so long with terrible Assault  At length is fall'n and blazes to the Sky  'Twas Pity HAROLD on so great a Day  When the rich Plunder of the War was seiz'd  Thy Valour lost it's Prey But fair Division  Of our acquired Spoil of Wealth and Captives  Shall bring thee Recompense  HAROLD  I thank thee Gen'ral  Devoted to thy Will I held my Charge  To guard our Camp from the outsallying Foe  A Charge less splendid than the Post in Battle  Yet as conducing to the general Weal  No whit less honourable  GOTHMUND  HAROLD behold  This Train of Captives to thy Charge I give them  But chiefly that stern Youth whose Arm oppos'd  Singly to mine long held the Conflict doubtful  No common Ransom shall redeem him hence  Why dost thou frown  to  EGBERT  EGBERT  Because I dare to scorn  My Country's Foe  GOTHMUND  So haughty in thy Chains  What Title bear'st thou  EGBERT  'Tis enough for thee  To know me still a  Briton  thence to fear me  GOTHMUND  A Conqu'ror fear his Captive By our Gods  Speak but another Word audacious  Christian  I'll plunge thee in the deep  Norwegian  Mine  Among these Slaves the Vassals of my Sword  To toil in Darkness thro' the livelong Year  Till baleful Damps consume thee  EGBERT  Yes bury me in Darkness in the Depth  Where Slavery drinks the pestilential Vapour  For that I've liv'd to see my Country's Fall  I dare thee to the Deed rapacious  Dane  But well I know thy Hand expects the Ransom  Nor aught but Av'rice chains thy Cruelty  GOTHMUND  What Shall I waste the Hours in fruitless Parle  With an audacious SlaveLo  Mercia's  Duke  Comes with his warlike Train Retire ye Slaves  And at an awful Distance bow to Valour  They retire backwards  This firey ATHELSTAN Yes I cou'd curse  Aside  His Sword victorious and wide wasting Arm  That blasted all my Wreaths and won the Praise  Of this eventful DayHence envious Fame  Shall tarnish GOTHMUND's Glory while she whispers  Or  haply to the listning World proclaims  That  Britain  conquer'd  Britain  Come fell Hate  Pour all thy Poison on my Heart and turn  Friendship to EnmityShould he revolt  The Rebel dare not Nor can e'er repass  The Gulph which he hath leapt and severs him  For ever from his CountryYet 'tis meet  That Prudence greet him with fair Speech and Smiles  Till some desir'd Occasion yield Pretence  And spurn him off to Shame  Let  Denmark's  Raven wave his dreadful Wing  Aloud  To hail the glad Approach of ATHELSTAN  And sound in Honour of our firm Ally  The Instruments of War  SCENE IV  To them  ATHELSTAN  with his Train  GOTHMUND  I greet thee ATHELSTAN Thy mighty Arm  On this great Day hath sham'd it's former Doings  Thro' the red Tracks of Death I saw thee seek  The King His Troops stricken with coward Guilt  Fled trembling at the Sight of injur'd Valour  Wak'd into Wrath Yes wondring  Denmark  saw  How Terror stalk'd before thee thro' the Streets  While thy broad Faulcion flam'd and dread Revenge  Frown'd on thy Helm like Fate  ATHELSTAN  No Flattery GOTHMUND  Balm to the Fool's it wounds the brave Man's Ear  My Sword hath reap'd sull Vengeance on its Foes  And vanquish'd ETHELRED with Tears and Groans  Shall rue the Wrongs he did me  GOTHMUND  Valiant Duke  Such Vengeance well became such Wrongs as thine  ATHELSTAN  My Wrongs were loud for Vengeance Pity wept  But Reason choak'd her VoiceFor awful Justice  Must drop her Sword unnerve her lifted Arm  Unbridled Pow'r turn Order into Chaos  Shou'd Pity melt at proud Oppression's Fall  What Youth is that who from the captive Throng  Comes forth with haughty Strides  GOTHMUND  An unknown  Briton  Yet fierce in Battle for his Sword was fatal  To many a  Dane  and midst the falling Ranks  Rag'd like a Whirlwind Mark his fearless Mien  He wears the Pride of Conquest tho' in Chains  His Eye devours thee ATHELSTAN  ATHELSTAN  I reck not  Let him come on I'll meet his Pride unmov'd  EGBERT  advancing  Who dares to frown on ATHELSTAN  EGBERT  A  Briton  ATHELSTAN  Who art thou  EGBERT  One who heedless of thy Rage  Dares throw his Scorn on Guilt  ATHELSTAN  Audacious Captive  Think'st thou I fear thy frown  EGBERT  Oh bleeding  England  Behold thy fatal Foe  He bursts into Tears  ATHELSTAN  Weep'st thou brave Youth  Tho' I have pour'd Destruction on thy King  I wage no War with Captives Gen'rous Warrior  My Pow'r shall shield thee and unbind thy Chains  EGBERT  Stand offI chuse to wear them  ATHELSTAN  Why that Choice  EGBERT  Lest these brave captive  Britons  shackled there  Should brand me for a Traitor  ATHELSTAN  Heed thee well  Think what thou art and where  EGBERT  Thank Heav'n  I am not ATHELSTAN  ATHELSTAN  Nay I can frown too  EGBERT  Blushrather blush The crimson Hue of Shame  Wou'd better suit thy Crimes  GOTHMUND  Peace arrogant Youth  ATHELSTAN  Who gave to thee this Privilege of Scorn  This Right of Insult and bold Accusation  EGBERT  That Pow'r who gave me Reason and Humanity  That awful Pow'r Above who bids me dare  To strip false Treason of her Mask of Pride  And shew the Hag in her own Shape and Hue  The foulest Fiend of Hell  ATHELSTAN  Thy Chains protect thee  GOTHMUND  GOODWIN lead forth these Captives to the Fleet  And let the first fair Breeze that fills the Sail  Waft them to  Denmark's  ShoreHAROLD bear hence  And guard that Insolent  Pointing to  EGBERT  EGBERT  Farewell brave Friends  My faithful Countrymen I weep your Fate  Doom'd to th' Oppressions of a barbarous Clime  Oh may some friendly Storm in Pity rise  And bid the Fury of devouring Seas  In Mercy swallow youAccursed Treason  Lo thy devoted Train Oh false false ATHELSTAN  Ex  EGBERT HAROLD GOODWIN DUNELM  and Captives  ATHELSTAN  Go froward  Briton  GOTHMUND  Valiant ATHELSTAN  Heed not a Captive's Clamour  Denmark  now  Boasts thee her Friend And for undoubted Proof  Of that Esteem wherewith I note thy Valour  Behold the precious Spoils my Arm hath won  Amid the gen'ral Plunder Gold or Captives  Lands Palaces whate'er inventive Passion  Can fancy for Enjoyment waits thy Will  Command it for 'tis thine  ATHELSTAN  Of Gold or Lands  The Plunder of the War I reck not aught  For to the noble Mind a great Revenge  Outweighs all other Good This I have reap'd  Fullmeasur'd Of my thankless Country's Blood  My Sword hath drank ev'n to Satiety  No other Boon it craves  GOTHMUND  Brave ATHELSTAN  Ev'n as thou wiltHas then no precious Spoil  Inrich'd thy Valour  ATHELSTAN  Yes one beauteous Captive  Won in the City's Storm and now consign'd  To SIWARD's Care a brave and faithful Friend  Who leads her hitherward So winning sweet  The surly Troops gaz'd on her as she pass'd  And Silence spoke their Wonder  GOTHMUND  Such a Fair  May haply mourn in secret that her Lot  Fell to thy aged Arm Some youthful Warrior  Might better suit her Wish  ATHELSTAN  I mean to shield her  From the rude Will of insolent Desire  GOTHMUND  Indeed  ATHELSTAN  IndeedIt was her chaste Request  And mark me Tho' my Arm hath quell'd it's Foes  Yet ATHELSTAN would blush to wreak his Vengeance  On a defenceless Woman  GOTHMUND  By what Chance  Did'st thou obtain this Captive  ATHELSTAN  While the Storm  Rag'd in the Streets Fate led my conqu'ring Band  Where this fair Captive mourn'd the Lot of War  I found her kneeling with uplifted Eyes  And Majesty resign'd imploring Heav'n  Rouz'd by the Shouts of War she rose Her Train  Fill'd all the Place with female Lamentation  But she in Grief superior check'd their Cries  And grac'd her Woes with regal Dignity  With such a noble Mien she su'd for Mercy  That Vengeance stood subdu'd while nameless Graces  Beauty and Mildness and majestic Grief  Like Guardian Pow'rs which Heav'n had planted round her  Check'd the rude Access of unhallow'd Rage  That ev'n the Sons of Violence drop'd the Sword  To gaze at awful DistanceTow'rd her Tent  This Way she moves with her attendant Train  Behold her here  SCENE V  To them  THYRA EDWINA SIWARD  and female Attendants  GOTHMUND  Indeed supremely fair  ATHELSTAN  THYRA be comforted Nay dry these Tears  Else shall I deem my too officious Cares  Lost on a thankless Heart  THYRA  Oh ATHELSTAN  Whose Mercy speaks thee brave Forgive these Tears  For my dear Lord to me than Life more dear  These Sorrows flowIndeed my thankful Heart  Melts in warm Gratitude to thy kind Care  Which sav'd me from the Horrors of this Day  But Ohmy Husband  GOTHMUND  Why these streaming Tears  What of her Husband Did he fall in Battle  ATHELSTAN  That is her Fear  Tho' Rumour yet speak doubtful of his Fate  THYRA  Too sure he's fall'nYe gen'rous Warriors hear  Hear a poor Captive's Pray'rOh let your Guards  Conduct my faithful Servants to the Field  Or give me Safeguard thro' the deathful Scene  I will divest me of my Woman's Fear  And with a  Scythian  Boldness tread in Gore  Drag off the Heaps of overwhelming Foes  Till I have found my EGBERT's dear Remains  To give them Burial The last mournful Duty  I e'er can pay his Love  ATHELSTAN  Despond not Fair one  Haply he yet may live  THYRA  Oh flatt'ring Hope  Grant me but ThatBut That ye Pow'rs of Heav'n  GOTHMUND  Now by our Gods of  Denmark  ATHELSTAN  This is too bright a Fair for Age like thine  Idly to gaze on  ATHELSTAN  Beauty thus afflicted  Merits my Pow'r's Protection  GOTHMUND  Is she not  The Captive of thy Sword  ATHELSTAN  True but the Sword  That won shall guard her  GOTHMUND  What if GOTHMUND's Will  Shou'd raise this Fair one from the captive Throng  To grace his Bed  ATHELSTAN  By Law of War she's mine  And I have sworn Protection  GOTHMUND  From thy Foe  To shield thy Captive were a Task of Praise  Worthy thy Arm But when a true Ally  Thy Friend in War intreats so small a Boon  ATHELSTAN  GOTHMUND the Friend whose erring Wish demands  What Honour cannot yieldI pray no more  GOTHMUND  If GOTHMUND's Friendship in thy thankless Heart  Insensible to all my proffer'd Bounty  Stands at so cheap a PriceProtect thy Captive  Let thy Pow'r shield her as it mayLead on  Exit  GOTHMUND  ATHELSTAN  Imperious  Dane  Would'st thou bend ATHELSTAN  Beneath thy PrideHis parting Words and Looks  Darted ContemptThis the Reward of Conquest  This Valour's Recompense  SIWARD  'Twas what I fear'd  Why did Revenge seduce thee from thy King  Bear Witness Heav'n if e'er I trod the Field  Or bar'd my Sword in seeming Aid of  Denmark  Save in the honest Hope to check thy Vengeance  ATHELSTAN  What To a thankless King a favour'd Foe  Basking beneath the royal Smile to yield  With cowardlike SubmissionFriend no more  The Dye of Fate is thrown  SIWARD  Didst thou not see  How Passion kindled while with ardent Gaze  He ey'd fair THYRA's Charms His Soul hath caught  A swift and deep Infection Mark th' Event  ATHELSTAN  Weak is thy Fear Tho' bold in Violence  He dare not wake my Rage  THYRA  Oh gen'rous Duke  Behold me at thy Feet I see the Storm  Fast gath'ring o'er my Head Redeem redeem me  From this rapacious  Dane  I dread not Death  Whose Image from my earliest Age of Woe  Hath been the calm Companion of my Thoughts  Then let thy Arm which on this fatal Morn  Did shield me now compleat it's gen'rous Care  My forfeit Life is thine In Pity kill me  Ere yet Dishonour blot my Innocence  ATHELSTAN  By my good Sword which won thee in the Storm  Again I swear not  Denmark's  proudest Threat  Shall wrest thee from meSIWARD are my  Mercians  Camp'd in their separate Quarter  SIWARD  Aye my Lord  Westward a Mile on a fair rising Ground  Fast by the River's Brink  ATHELSTAN  This Night I meant  To pass in Council with the General GOTHMUND  On future Enterprize But since his Pride  Brooks no Controulwou'd Heav'n I had not come  Since it is thusAt least his Pride shall seek me  And if I find him bent on Violence  The Morning Sun shall see me quit his Camp  Hast thou prepar'd fair THYRA's Tent by mine  SIWARD  I did command it so  ATHELSTAN  Retire we then  THYRA  I merit not thy Care Why shou'd I live  When my dear Lord is lost and  England  fall'n  ATHELSTAN  Touch not on ThatFor by this Arm it fell  Yes I have wash'd my Footsteps in the Blood  Of my despairing FoesBut oh for whom  I'll think

Earth and Heav'n  My Soul's on FireThe Glories of the War  The Wreaths of Conquest sicken on her Sight  Avaunt Ambition yield thy Throne to Love  HAROLD she must be mine  HAROLD  What lets thee then  What Bar so strong to guard her from thy Wish  Each cobweb Hindrance to thy Breath shall yield  If thou but  will  her Thine  GOTHMUND  May I ne'er taste the Warrior's Lot in Death  Ne'er quaff the rich Meath in th' infernal Courts  Where mighty ODIN rules the glorious Dead  If I not seize her BeautiesBut brave HAROLD  This delicate Captive is no common Food  Like what we snatch in ev'ry City's Plunder  For gross Desire to seed on I wou'd win  Her Soul's Consent wou'd kindle mutual Passion  To meet my Flame At least by fair Persuasion  Wou'd temper Pow'r that the Effect might seem  Without all Shew of Violence HAROLD haste thee  To the fair Captive's Tent Tell her the Gods  Of  Denmark  claim their wonted Sacrifice  Of captive Youths and thirst for  England's  Gore  But if her dear Consent shall crown my Wish  Our Gods propitious will accept her Smile  In Ransom for their Blood Paint forth the Terrors  Of the dread Sacrifice the Victims bound  The howling Incantations of our Priests  Invoking Hell the glittering Faulcion bar'd  The streaming Gore and Horrors of the Altar  The mournful Tale shall melt her into Grief  And Pity plead Consent  HAROLD  I wait thy Will  Yet were my Counsel worthy GOTHMUND's Ear  GOTHMUND  What woud'st thouSay  HAROLD  Some captive  Briton  best  Wou'd bend her Pride  GOTHMUND  Not so These stubborn  Britons  Unconquer'd ev'n in Chains defy our Swords  Awful in Ruin Like their kindred Oaks  Tho' blasted by the Thunder of the War  They proudly bear their scorched Ribs aloft  And brave the Pow'r that struck them Therefore HAROLD  That Hope is vain  HAROLD  Persuasion sure wou'd flow  Prompt and more pow'rful from some Captive's Tongue  To Death or endless Slav'ry doom'd yet sooth'd  With Hope and promis'd Freedom For the Speech  Of mimic Art is weak and sinewless  To the strong Workings of the lab'ring Soul  When Passion glows within  GOTHMUND  'Tis well advis'd  Then lead some captive  Briton  to her Tent  On this great Purpose But o'er all I fear  This haughty ATHELSTAN He claims her His  By Law of Battle and hath sworn Protection  HAROLD  Is GOTHMUND's Pow'r so weak then that he dreads  A Traitor's Frown  GOTHMUND  Nay by our Gods I'll seize her  Tho' he and all the witching Pow'rs of Hell  Tho' the weird Sisters and each horrible Shape  That haunts the midnight Forest hemm her round  With Magick IncantationHAROLD

Clouds that sail on warring Winds  Their sierce conflicting Wrath shall meet in Thunder  And Ruin close the Fray  SCENE III  To him  EGBERT  HAROLD  Welcome brave Youth  Thy Fame and known Preeminence in Valour  Have call'd thee to a generous Task of Duty  For  Britain's  WealThou know'st by Doom of War  Full fifty Captives to our Gods must bleed  EGBERT  So doom your fancy'd Gods the vain Creation  Of Fear and Cruelty But righteous Heav'n  That sees your Blindness with a pitying Eye  Detests the Sacrifice  HAROLD  Prevent it then  EGBERT  Name but the Means If my devoted Blood  Can save my guiltless Countrymen from Death  I yield it to the Altar  HAROLD  Valiant EGBERT  A gentler Task is thine A captive Beauty  Brightens yon Tent She hath subdu'd our General  The Rage of Love is on him If thy Tongue  Can win her to his Bed  EGBERT  HAROLD no more  Think'st thou because I drag the Chain of War  My Soul must wear your Shackles Fall'n a Captive  I bear a  Briton's  Heart The Coward only  Earns Safety by Dishonour  HAROLD  Yet many a  Briton  Wou'd deem it Service worth a brave Man's Care  To save devoted Innocence from Death  At this cheap Price Weigh'd with the Blood of Man

Oh fatal fatal Blow  SIWARD  Lift up thine Eyes  In Pity to thy weeping SIWARD speak  Hear generous ATHELSTAN  OFFICER  He heeds thee not  ATHELSTAN  Thus to be slaughter'd by thy Father's Hand  My EMMAOh my Child  SIWARD  An agonizing Sweat  Sits on his Brow The Hand of Death is on him  ATHELSTAN  Oh Oh Oh  Dies  SIWARD  He dies he diesHis strong conflicting Griefs  Have burst his mighty HeartOh ATHELSTAN  Thy Friends shall weep and ev'ry generous Foe  Confess thy Virtues and lament thy Fate  Hadst thou been true what brighter Name had deck'd  Thy Country's Story But thy tow'ring Spirit  Deepshaken by the Tempest of Revenge  From its Uprightness tottering bore thee down  Ev'n to Perdition's DepthYet may the Woes  Which Heav'n's avenging Hand hath heap'd upon thee  Recorded stand a Monument of Justice  That when in future Times a King shall reign  Brave good and just the Father of his People  Th' abhorr'd Example may avert those Ills  Thy traitrous Arm hath wroughtThat black Rebellion  May never rear her Standard nor unsheath  Her guilty Sword to aid the fell Invader  That Faction's Sons in thee their Fate may read  That by the Father's Crime the Child shall bleed  And private Woe to publick Guilt succeed  End of the  FIFTH ACT  EPILOGUE  Written by Mr GARRICK  Spoken by Mrs CIBBER  To speak Ten Words again I've fetch'd my Breath  The Tongue of Woman struggles hard with Death  Ten Words will that suffice Ten Wordsno more  We always give a Thousand to the Score  What can provoke these Wits their Time to waste  To please that fickle fleeting Thing call'd Taste  It mocks all Search for Substance has it none  Like  Hamlet's  Ghost'Tis here'Tis there'Tis gone  How very few about the Stage agree  As Men with diff'rent Eyes a Beauty see  So judge they of that stately DameQueenTragedy  The Greekread Critic as his Mistress holds her  And having little Love for Trifles scolds her  Excuses want of Spirit Beauty Grace  But ne'er forgives her failingTime and Place  How do our Sex of Taste in Judgment vary  Miss  Bell  adores what's loath'd by Lady  Mary  The first in Tenderness a very Dove  Melts like the feather'd Snow at  Juliet's  Love  Then sighing turns to  Romeo  by her Side  "Can you believe that Men for Love have dy'd"  Her Ladyship who vaults the Coarser's Back  Leaps the barr'd Gate and calls you  Tom  and  Jack  Detests these Whinings like a true Virago  She's all for Daggers Blood Blood Blood  Iago  A  third  whose Heart defies all Perturbations  Yet dies for Triumphs Funerals Coronations  Ne'er asks which Tragedies succeed ôr fail  But whose  Procession  has the longest Tail  The  Youths  to whom  France  gives a new Belief  Who look with  Horror  on a Rump of Beef  On  Shakespear's  Plays with shrugg'd up Shoulders stare  These Plays They're bloody Murders  O Barbare  And yet the Man has Merit  Entre Nous  He'd been damn'd clever had he read  Bossù  Shakespear  read  French  roars out a surly Cit  When  Shakespear  wrote our Valour match'd our Wit  Had  Britons  then been Fops Queen  Bess  had hang'd 'em  Those Days they never  read  the  French  They  band'd  'em  If Taste evaporates by too high Breeding  And eke is overlaid by too deep Reading  Lest then in search of this you lose your Feeling  And barter native Sense in foreign Dealing  Be this neglected Truth to  Britons  known  No Tastes no Modes become you but your own  FINIS  Lately published  By the same AUTHOR BARBAROSSA  A TRAGEDY  The SECOND EDITION
