 A SERMON Preached before the Incorporated SOCIETY FOR THE Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts AT THEIR ANNIVERSARY MEETING IN THE ParishChurch of St  MaryleBow  On FRIDAY  February    By  GEORGE BERKELEY  DD Dean of  Londonderry  LONDON Printed by J DOWNING in  BartholomewClose  near  WestSmithfield    February  At the Anniversary Meeting of the Society  for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts    AGreed That the Thanks of the SOCIETY be given to the Reverend Mr Dean  Berkeley  for his Sermon Preached this Day before the SOCIETY and that He be desired to Print the same  David Humphreys  Secretary  JOHN XVII v  This is Life Eternal that they may know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  _THAT human kind were not designed merely to sojourn a few Days upon this Earth that a Being of such Excellence as the Soul of Man so capable of a nobler Life and having such a high Sense of Things moral and intellectual was not created in the sole View of being imprisoned in an earthly Tabernacle and partaking a few Pains and Pleasures which chequer this mortal Life without aspiring to any thing either above or beyond it is a Fundamental Doctrine as well of Natural Religion as of the Christian It comes at once recommended  by the Authority of Philosophers and Evangelists And that there actually is in the Mind of Man a strong instinct and desire an appetite and tendency towards another and a better State incomeparably superior to the present both in point of Happiness and Duration is no more than every one's Experience and inward Feeling may inform him The satiety and disrelish attending sensual Enjoyments the relish for things of a more pure and spiritual kind the restless Motion of the Mind from one terrene Object of pursuit to another and often a Flight or Endeavour above them all towards something unknown and perfective of its Nature are so many signs and tokens of this better State which in the Style of the Gospel is termed Life Eternal  AND as this is the greatest Good that can befal us the very end of our Being and that alone which can crown and satisfy our Wishes and without which we shall be ever restless and uneasy so every Man who knows and acts up to his true Interest must make it his principal Care and Study to obtain it And in order to this he must endeavour to live suitably to his Calling and of consequence endeavour to  make others obtain it too For how can a Christian shew himself worthy of his Calling otherwise than by performing the Duties of it And what Christian Duty is more essentially so than that of Charity And what Object can be found upon Earth more deserving our Charity than the Souls of Men Or how is it possible for the most beneficent Spirit to do them better Service than by promoting their best and most lasting Interest that is by putting them in the Way that leads to Eternal Life  WHAT this Eternal Life was or how to come at it were Points unknown to the Heathen World It must be owned the wise Men of Old who followed the Light of Nature saw even by that Light that the Soul of Man was debased and born downwards contrary to its natural Bent by carnal and terrene Objects and that on the other hand it was exalted purged and in some sort assimulated to the Deity by the Contemplation of Truth and Practice of Virtue Thus much in general they saw or surmised But then about the Way and Means to know the one or perform the other they were much at a loss They were not agreed concerning the true End  of Mankind which as they saw was mistaken in the vulgar Pursuits of Men so they found it much more easy to confute the Errors of others than to ascertain the Truth themselves Hence so many Divisions and Disputes about a Point which it most imported them to know insomuch as it was to give the Bias to human Life and govern the whole Tenor of their Actions and Conduct  BUT when Life and Immortality were brought to Light by the Gospel there could remain no Dispute about the chief End and Felicity of Man no more than there could about the Means of obtaining it afer the express Declaration of our Blessed Lord in the Words of my Text  This is Life eternal that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  For the right understanding of which Words we must observe that by the Knowledge of God is not meant a barren Speculation either of Philosophers or Scholastic Divines nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce Disputes and Dissentions among Men but on the contrary an holy practical Knowledge which is the Source the Root or Principle of Peace and Union of Faith Hope Charity and universal Obedience  A Man may frame the most accurate Notions and in one Sense attain the exactest Knowledge of God and Christ that human Faculties can reach and yet notwithstanding all this be far from knowing them in that saving Sense For St  John  tells us  Joh iii  that  whosoever sinneth hath not seen Christ nor known him  And again  Joh iv  He that loveth not knoweth not God  To know God as we ought we must love him and love him so as withal to love our Brethren his Creatures and his Children I say that Knowledge of God and Christ which is Life eternal implies universal Charity with all the Duties ingrafted thereon or ensuing from thence that is to say the Love of God and Man And our Lord expresly saith  John xiv  He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me  From all which it is evident that this saving Knowledge of God is inseparable from the Knowledge and Practice of his Will the explicit Declaration whereof and of the Means to perform it are contained in the Gospel that divine Instrument of Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men The metaphysical Knowledge of God considered in his absolute Nature of Essence is one thing and to know him as  he stands related to us as Creator Redeemer and Sanctifier is another The former kind of Knowledge whatever it amounts to hath been and may be in Gentiles as well as Christians but not the latter which is Life eternal  FROM what hath been said it is a plain Consequence that whoever is a sincere Christian cannot be indifferent about bringing over other Men to the Knowledge of God and Christ but that every one of us who hath any Claim to that Title is indispensably obliged in Duty to God and in Charity to his Neighbour to desire and promote so far as there is Opportunity the Conversion of Heathen and Infidels that so they may become Partakers of Life and Immortality For  this is Life eternal to know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  IN my present Discourse upon which Words I shall  First  CONSIDER in general the Obligation that Christians lie under of bringing other Men to the Knowledge of the only true God and of Jesus Christ And  Secondly  I shall consider it in Reference to this laudable Society instituted for the Propagation of the Gospel And under each Head I propose to obviate such Difficulties as may seem to retard and intermix such Remarks as shall appear proper to forward so good a Work  NOW although it be very evident that we can really have neither a just Zeal for the Glory of God nor a beneficent Love of Man without wishing and endeavouring as occasion serves to spread the glad Tidings of Salvation and bring those who are benighted in the Shadow of Death to Life eternal by the Knowledge of the only true God and of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent Yet this Duty plain and undoubted as it seems happens to be too often overlooked even by those whose Attention to other Points would make one think their Neglect of this not an Effect of lukewarm Indifference so much as of certain mistaken Notions and Suppositions Two principal Considerations occur which in this particular seem to have slackened  the Industry of some otherwise zealous and serious Christians  ONE I apprehend to be this that it is surmised the Christian Religion is in a declining State which by many Symptoms seems likely to end either in Popery or a general Infidelity And that of Course a prudent Person has nothing to do but to make sure of his own Salvation and to acquiesce in the general Tendency of things without being at any fruitless Pains to oppose what cannot be prevented to steer against the Stream or resist a Torrent which as it flows gathers Strength and Rapidity and in the End will be sure to overflow and carry all before it When a Man of a desponding and foreboding Spirit hath been led by his observation of the Ways of the World and the prevailing Humour of our Times to think after this manner he will be inclined to strengthen this his preconceived Opinion as is usual in other the like Cases by Misapplication of holy Scripture For instance by those Words of our Blessed Saviour  Luke xviii  When the Son of Man cometh shall he find Faith upon Earth  which have been applied to this very purpose as importing that before the final Judgment  Christian Faith should be extinguished upon Earth Although these Words do from the Context seem plainly to refer to the Destruction of  Jerusalem  and the obstinate Blindness of the Jews who even then when they felt the Hand of God should not acknowledge it or believe the  Roman  Army to be the Instrument of Divine Vengeance in the Day of their Visitation by him whom they had injuriously treated rejected and put to Death  BUT granting the former Sense might be supported by no absurd Hypothesis or no improbable Guess yet shall the Endeavours of Christian Men for propagating the Gospel of Christ be forestalled by any Suppositions or Conjectures whatsoever admitting I say those Words regard the future Advent of Jesus Christ yet can any one tell how near or how far off that Advent may be Are not the Times and Seasons foreknown only to God And shall we neglect a certain Duty to Day upon an uncertain Surmise of what is to come hereafter This way of thinking might furnish as strong Reasons against Preaching at home as abroad within as without the Pale of the Church It would be as specious an Argument against the one as the other  but in reality can conclude against neither For as we know not when that supposed Time of general Infidelity is to be or whether it will be at all so if it were ever so sure and ever so near it would nevertheless become us to take Care that it may not be an Effect of our own particular Indifference and Neglect  BUT if we take our Notions not from the uncertain Interpretation of a particular Text but from the whole Tenor of the divine Oracles from the express Promise and reiterated Predictions of our Blessed Lord and his Apostles we shall believe that  Phil ii  Jesus Christ is highly exalted of God to the End that at his Name every Knee shall bow and every Tongue confess that he is the Lord to the Glory of God the Father  That  Cor xv  he must Reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet  That  Mat xxviii  He is with us alway even unto the End of the World  And that  Mat xvi  The Church of the living God the pillar and ground of Truth is so far from being destroy'd human Means that the gates of Hell  all the infernal Powers  shall not prevail against it  Let us therefore banish all such Conceits as may seem to justifie our Indolence as may reason us out of all courage and vigour in the Race that is set before  us let us not I say slacken our own Hands nor enfeeble our own Knees by preconceived Fancies and Suppositions considering that as the Success of all Enterprises in great Measure depends on the Spirit of the Undertakers so nothing is more apt to raise a Spirit than Hope or to depress it than Despondency We ought therefore to shake off every vain Fear in our spiritual Warfare The Number the Presumption and the Abilities of those who take Counsel together against the Lord and against his Anointed should not dishearten but rather excite and encourage us to stand in the Gap  ANOTHER Consideration that may possibly withhold divers sincere Believers from contributing their Endeavours for bringing Men to the Knowledge of God and Christ and thereby to eternal Life is the want of Miracles in the present Age Men naturally cast about for Reasons to countenance the Part they take And as the Gift of Miracles was of mighty Influence and Help to those who were commissioned to spread abroad the Light of the Gospel in its first promulgation so no Pretence offers it self more naturally to excuse a Man from executing any purpose than the want of Authority which in the Opinion of  Men cannot be without a just Commission nor this unless distinguished by those proper Means and Powers that have been known to attend it Now with regard to this defect of Miracles I shall beg leave to make two Observations  First  It is to be observed that if we have not Miracles we have other Advantages which make them less necessary now than in the first spreading of the Gospel Whole Nations have found the Benefit of Christ's Religion it is protected by Princes established and encouraged by Laws supported by Learning and Arts recommended by the Experience of many Ages as well as by the Authority and Example of the wisest and most knowing Men Certainly if the greater Part of Mankind are Gentiles or Mahometans it cannot be denied that the most knowing most learned and most improved Nations profess Christianity and that even the Mahometans themselves bear Testimony to the Divine Mission of Jesus Christ Whereas therefore in the Beginning a few illiterate Wanderers of the meanest of the People had the Prejudices the Learning and the Power of their own as well as other Nations in one Word the whole World to oppose  and overcome Those who at this Day engage in the Propagation of the Gospel do it upon Terms in many Respects far more easy and advantageous It is Power against Weakness Civility against Barbarism Knowledge against Ignorance some or other if not all these Advantages in the present Times attending the Progress of the Christian Religion in whatever Part of the World Men shall attempt to plant it  IN the second Place we may reflect that if we have not the Gift of Miracles this is a good Reason why we should exert more strongly those human Means which God hath put in our Power and make our ordinary Faculties whether of the Head or the Hand or the Tongue our Interest our Credit or our Fortune subservient to the great Giver of them and chearfully contribute our humble Mite towards hastening that Time wherein  Psalm lxxxvi  all Nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shall glorifie thy Name  It is at least a plain Case that the Want of Apostolical Gifts should not be pleaded as a Bar to our doing that which in no Respect either of Difficulty or Danger equals or approaches the Apostolical Office What  Pretence can this supply for Mens being quite unconcerned about the spreading of the Gospel or the Salvation of Souls For Mens forgetting that they are Christians and related to human Kind How can this justify their overlooking Opportunities which lie in their Way their not contributing a small Part of their Fortune towards forwarding a Design wherein they share neither Pains nor Peril the not bestowing on it even the cheap Assistance of their Speech Attention Counsel or Countenance as Occasion offers How unlike is this worldly selfish Indifference to that Account which St  Paul  gives of himself that  Cor x  he sought not his own the Profit but the Profit of many that they may be saved  And yet herein he expected the  Corinthians  and the same Reason will hold for us should be like him for he subjoins  Be ye Followers of me as I also am of Christ  HAVING considered the Duty in general I come now to treat of it with Reference to  America  the peculiar Province of this Venerable Society which I suppose well informed of the State and Progress of Religion in that part of the World by their Correspondencies with the Clergy upon their Mission It may nevertheless  be expected that one who had been engaged in a Design in this very View who hath been upon the Place and resided a considerable Time in one of our Colonies should have observed somewhat worth reporting It is to be hoped therefore that one Part of my Audience will pardon what the other may perhaps expect while I detain them with the Narrative of a few Things I have observed and such Reflections as thereupon suggested themselves some part of which may possibly be found to extend to other Colonies  RhodeIsland  with a Portion of the adjacent Continent under the same Government is inhabited by an  English  Colony consisting chiefly of Sectaries of many different Denominations who seem to have worn off part of that Prejudice which they inherited from their Ancestors against the National Church of this Land though it must be acknowledged at the same Time that too many of them have worn off a serious Sense of all Religion Several indeed of the better Sort are accustomed to assemble themselves regularly on the Lord's Day for the Performance of Divine Worship But most of those who are dispersed  throughout this Colony seem to rival some wellbred People of other Countries in a thorough Indifference for all that is sacred being equally careless of outward Worship and of inward Principles whether of Faith or Practice Of the Bulk of them it may certainly be said that they live without the Sacraments not being so much as baptized And as for their Morals I apprehend there is nothing to be found in them that should tempt others to make an Experiment of their Principles either in Religion or Government But it must be owned the general Behaviour of the Inhabitants in those Towns where Churches and Meetings have been long settled and regularly attended seems so much better as sufficiently to shew the Difference which a solemn regular Worship of God makes between Persons of the same Blood Temper and natural Faculties  THE native Indians who are said to have been formerly many Thousands within the compass of this Colony do not at present amount to one Thousand including every Age and Sex And these are all either Servants or Labourers for the English who have contributed more to destroy their Bodies by the Use of strong  Liquors than by any Means to improve their Minds or save their Souls This slow Poison jointly operating with the SmallPox and their Wars but much more destructive than both hath consumed the Indians not only in our Colonies but also far and wide upon our Confines And having made Havock of them is now doing the same Thing by those who taught them that odious Vice  THE Negroes in the Government of  RhodeIsland  are about half as many more than the Indians and both together scarce amount to a seventh Part of the whole Colony The Religion of these People as is natural to suppose takes after that of their Masters Some few are baptized several frequent the different Assemblies and far the greater Part none at all An antient Antipathy to the Indians whom it seems our first Planters therein as in certain other Particulars affecting to imitate Jews rather than Christians imagined they had a Right to treat on the Foot of  Canaanites  or  Amalekites  together with an irrational Contempt of the Blacks as Creatures of another Species who had no Right to be instructed or admitted to the Sacraments have proved a  main Obstacle to the Conversion of these poor People  TO this may be added an erroneous Notion that the being baptized is inconsistent with a State of Slavery To undeceive them in this Particular which had too much Weight it seemed a proper Step if the Opinion of his Majesty's Attorney and SollicitorGeneral could be procured This Opinion they charitably sent over signed with their own Hands which was accordingly printed in  RhodeIsland  and dispersed throughout the Plantations I heartily wish it may produce the intended Effect It must be owned our reformed Planters with respect to the Natives and the Slaves might learn from those of the Church of  Rome  how it is their Interest and Duty to behave Both  French  and  Spaniards  have intermarried with  Indians  to the great Strength Security and Increase of their Colonies They take Care to instruct both them and their Negroes in the  Popish  Religion to the Reproach of those who profess a better They have also Bishops and Seminaries for Clergy and it is not found that their Colonies are worse Subjects or depend less on their Mother Country on that Account  IT should seem that the likeliest Step towards converting the Heathen would be to begin with the  English  Planters whose Influence will for ever be an Obstacle to propagating the Gospel till they have a right Sense of it themselves which would shew them how much it is their Duty to impart it to others The Missionaries employed by this Venerable Society have done and continue to do good Service in bringing those Planters to a serious Sense of Religion which it is hoped will in time extend to others I speak it knowingly that the Ministers of the Gospel in those Provinces which go by the Name of  NewEngland  sent and supported at the Expence of this Society have by their Sobriety of Manners discreet Behaviour and a competent Degree of useful Knowledge shewn themselves worthy the Choice of those who sent them and particularly in living on a more friendly Foot with their Brethren of the Separation who on their Part are also very much come off from that Narrowness of Spirit which formerly kept them at such an unamicable Distance from us And as there is reason to apprehend that Part of  America  could not have been thus distinguished and provided with such a  Number of proper Persons if one half of them had not been supplied out of the dissenting Seminaries of the Country who in Proportion as they attain to more liberal Improvements of Learning are observed to quit their Prejudice towards an Episcopal Church so I verily think it might increase the Number of such useful Men if Provision were made to defray their Charges in coming hither to receive holy Orders passing and repassing the Ocean and tarrying the necessary Time in  London  requiring an Expence that many are not able to bear It would also be an Encouragement to the Missionaries in general and probably produce good Effects if the Allowance of certain Missionaries were augmented in proportion to the Service they had done and the Time they had spent in their Mission These Hints I venture to suggest as not unuseful in an Age wherein all humane Encouragements are found more necessary than at the first Propagation of the Gospel But they are with all due Deference and Respect submitted to the Judgment of this Venerable Audience  AFTER all it is hardly to be expected that so long as Infidelity prevails at home the Christian Religion should thrive and  flourish in our Colonies abroad Mankind it must be owned left to themselves are so much bewildered and benighted with respect to the Origin of that Evil which they feel and from which they are at a Loss about the Means of being freed that the Doctrines of the lapsed State of Man his Reconciliation by Christ and Regeneration by the Spirit may reasonably be hoped to find an easy Admission as bringing with them Light and Comfort into a Mind not hardened by Impenitency nor foreclosed by Pride nor bias'd by Prejudice But such is the Vanity of Man that no Prejudice operates more powerfully than that in Favour of Fashion and no Fashions are so much followed by our Colonies as those of the Mother Country which they often adopt in their Modes of living to their great Inconvenience without allowing for the Disparity of Circumstance or Climate This same Humour hath made Infidelity as I find it too credibly reported spread in some of our wealthy Plantations uneducated Men being more apt to tread in the Steps of Libertines and Men of Fashion than to model themselves by the Laws and Institutions of their Mother  Country or the Lives and Professions of the virtuous and religious Part of it  BUT this is not all While those abroad are less disposed to receive some at home are perhaps less disposed to propagate the Gospel from the same Cause It is to be feared I say that the prevailing Torrent of Infidelity which staggers the Faith of some may cool the Zeal and damp the Spirit of others who judging from the Event and Success of those who impugn the Church of Christ may possibly entertain some Scruple or Surmise whether it may not be for the present at least abandoned by Providence and that human Care must ineffectually interpose till it shall please God  yet once more to shake not the Earth only but also the Heavens  This Point hath been touched before but deserves farther Consideration to the end that the peculiar Impiety of a profane Age may not be a Bar to those very Endeavours which it self renders more necessary and calls for more loudly now than ever  WHATEVER Men may think the Arm of the Lord is not shorten'd In all this Prevalency of Atheism and Irreligion there is no Advantage gained by the Powers of Darkness either against God or godly Men  but only against their own wretched Partisans The Christian Dispensation is a Dispensation of Grace and Favour The Christian Church a Society of Men intitled to this Grace on performing certain Conditions If this Society is diminished as those who remain true Members of it suffer no Loss to themselves so God loseth no Right suffereth no Detriment foregoeth no Good his Grace resisted or unfruitful being no more lost to him than the Light of the Sun shining on desart Places or among People who shut their Eyes  BESIDES this Excess this unstemmed Torrent of Profaneness may possibly in the Conclusion defeat itself confirm what it meant to extirpate and instead of destroying prove a Means of preserving our Religion the evil Fruits and Effects thereof being so notorious and flagrant and so sensibly felt as in all likelyhood to be able to open the Eyes and rouse the Attention of those who may be blind and deaf to every other Argument and Consideration Or who knows but the Christian Church corrupted by Prosperity is to be restored and purified by Adversity which may prove for ought we can tell as salutary in future as it hath been in past Ages Many insolent and presumptuous  Foes have set themselves against the Church of God whose Hook nevertheless may be in their Nostrils and his Bridle in their Lips managing and governing even their Rage and Folly to the fulfilling of his own wise Purposes and who may not fail in the End to deal by them as he did by the King of  Assyria  when he had  performed his Work upon Sin and upon Jerusalem punishing their stout Heart and high Looks  This presumptuous Conqueror was without knowing it a Tool or Instrument in the Hands of that God whom he blasphemed  Isa x  O Assyrian the Rod of mine Anger I will send him against an hypocritical Nation and against the People of my Wrath will I give him a Charge to take the Spoil and to take the Prey and to tread them down like the Mire of the Streets Howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his Heart think so but it is in his Heart to destroy and cut off Nations not a few  THUS much at least is evident It is no new Thing that great Enormities should produce great Humiliations and these again noble Vertues which have often recovered both single Men and whole States even in a natural and civil Sense And if the Captivities Distresses and Desolations of the Jewish  Church have occasioned their Return to God and reinstated them in his Favour nay if it was actually foretold whenever they lay under the Curse of God at the Mercy of their Enemies peeled and scattered in a foreign Land that nevertheless upon their calling his Covenant to Mind and returning to him  Deut xxx  the Lord their God would turn their Captivity and have Compassion upon them  I say if Things were so why may we not in Reason hope for something analogous thereto in behalf of the Christian Church It cannot be denied that there was a great Analogy between the Jewish Institutions and the Doctrines of the Gospel for instance between the Paschal Lamb and the Lamb of God slain from the Foundation of the World between the  Egyptian  Bondage and that of Sin the earthly  Canaan  and the heavenly the fleshly Circumcision and the spiritual In these and many other Particulars the Analogy seems so plain that it can hardly be disputed To be convinced that the Law of  Moses  and the Jewish Oeconomy were Figures and Shadows of the Evangelical we need only look into the Epistle to the  Hebrews  May we not therefore in pursuance of this same Analogy  suppose a similar Treatment of the Jewish and Christian Church  LET us then see on what Terms the former stood with God in order to discover what the latter may reasonably expect The solemn Denunciation to the Jews was  Deut xxviii  If thou shalt kearken diligently to the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this Day the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the Nations of the Earth  But in case of Disobedience it is added among many other Threats and Maledictions  Ver  The Lord shall smite thee with Blasting and with Mildew and the Heaven that is over thy Head shall be Brass and the Earth that is under thy Feet shall be Iron  And again  Ver  The Lord shall smite thee with Madness and Blindness and Astonishment of Heart  Have not the People of this Land drawn down upon it by more Ways than one the just Judgments of Heaven Surely we have felt in a Metaphor the first of the forementioned Judgments and the last hath been literally fulfilled upon us Is it not visible that we are less knowing less vertuous less reasonable in proportion as we are less religious Are we not grown drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity and Presumption and Freethinking and  Extravagance of every kind to a Degree that we may truly be said to be  smitten with Madness and Blindness and Astonishment of Heart  AS antiently most unchristian Schisms and Disputes joined with great Corruption of Manners made way for the Mahometan in the East and the Papal Dominion in the West even so here at home in the last Century a weak Reliance upon human Politics and Power on the one hand and enthusiastic Rage on the other together with carnal Mindedness on both gave occasion to introduce Atheism and Infidelity If the temporal State and outward Form of the Jewish Church was upon their Defection overturned by Invaders in like manner when Christians are no longer governed by the Light of Evangelical Truth when we resist the Spirit of God are we not to expect that  the Heaven above will be as Brass  that the Divine Grace will no longer shower down on our obdurate Hearts that our Church and Profession will be blasted by licentious Scorners those Madmen who in Sport  scatter Firebrands Arrows and Death  As all this is no more than we may reasonably suppose will ensue upon our Backsliding so we  may with equal Reason hope it will be remedied upon our Return to God  FROM what hath been said it follows that in order to propagate the Gospel abroad it is necessary we do it at home and extend our Charity to domestic Infidels if we would convert or prevent foreign ones So that a View of the declining State of Religion here at home of those things that produced this Declension and of the proper Methods to repair it is naturally connected with the Subject of this Discourse I shall therefore beg your Patience while I just mention a few Remarks or Hints too obvious perhaps in themselves to be new or unknown to any present but too little visible in their Effects to make one think they are by all much attended to  SOME preferring Points notional or ritual to the Love of God and Man consider the National Church only as it stands opposed to other Christian Societies These generally have a Zeal without Knowledge and the Effects are suitable to the Cause they really hurt what they seem to espouse Others more solicitous about the Discovery of Truth than the Practice of Holiness employ themselves rather to spy out Errors in the Church than enforce its Precepts  These it is to be feared postpone the great Interests of Religion to Points of less Concern in any Eyes but their own But surely they would do well to consider that an humble though confused or indistinct Faith in the Bond of Charity and productive of good Works is much more Evangelical than an accurate disputing and conceited Knowledge  A Church which contains the Fundamentals and nothing subversive of those Fundamentals is not to be set at naught by any particular Member because it may not in every Point perhaps correspond with his Ideas no not though he is sure of being in the right Probably there never was or will be an established Church in this World without visible Marks of Humanity upon it Saint  Paul  supposeth  x Cor iii  that  on the Foundation of Jesus Christ there will be human Superstructures of Hay and Stubble  things light and trivial wrong or superstitious which indeed is a natural Consequence of the Weakness and Ignorance of Man But where that living Foundation is rightly laid in the Mind there will not fail to grow and spring from thence those Vertues and Graces which are the genuine Effects and Tokens of true Faith and which are by no  means inconsistent with every Error in Theory or every needless Rite in Worship  THE Christian Religion was calculated for the Bulk of Mankind and therefore cannot reasonably be supposed to consist in subtle and nice Notions From the time that Divinity was considered as a Science and human Reason enthroned in the Sanctuary of God the Hearts of its Professors seem to have been less under the Influence of Grace From that time have grown many unchristian Dissentions and Controversies of Men  Tim vi  knowing nothing but doating about Questions and Strife of Words whereof cometh Envy Strife Railings evil Surmises perverse Disputings of Men of corrupt Minds and destitute of Truth  Doubtless the making Religion a notional Thing hath been of infinite Disservice And whereas its holy Mysteries are rather to be received with Humility of Faith than defined and measured by the accuracy of human Reason all Attempts of this kind however well intended have visibly failed in the Event and instead of reconciling Infidels have by creating Disputes and Heats among the Professors of Christianity given no small Advantage to its Enemies  TO conclude if we proportioned our Zeal to the Importance of Things If we could love Men whose Opinions we do not approve If we knew the World more and liked it less If we had a due Sense of the Divine Perfection and our own Defects If our chief Study was the Wisdom from above described by St  Paul  And if in order to all this that were done in Places of Education which cannot so well be done out of them I say if these Steps were taken at home while proper Measures are carrying on abroad the one would very much forward or facilitate the other As it is not meant so it must not be understood that foreign Attempts should wait for domestic Success but only that it is to be wished they may cooperate Certainly if a just and rational a genuine and sincere a warm and vigorous Piety animated the MotherCountry the Influence thereof would soon reach our Foreign Plantations and extend throughout their Borders We should soon see Religion shine forth with new Lustre and Force to the Conversion of Infidels both at home and abroad and to  Cor x  the casting down high Imaginations and every Thing  that exalteth it self against the Knowledge of God and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ  To whom with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST be ascribed all Praise Might Majesty and Dominion now and for ever  FINIS
