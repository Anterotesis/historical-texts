 INTRODUCTION TO THE SCHOOL OF SHAKESPEARE  INTRODUCTION TO THE SCHOOL OF SHAKESPEARE Held on Wednesday Evenings In the Apollo at the Devil Tavern Temple Bar  TO WHICH IS ADDED A RETORT COURTEOUS ON THE CRITICKS As delivered at the Second and Third Lectures  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY THE BOOKSELLERS ALSO AT THE DEVIL TAVERN  ADVERTISEMENT  DR KENRICK having advisedly deserred the printing of his edition of Shakespeare till that of Mr Steevens appeared the expediency of carrying his work into immediate execution is so much abated by the labours of that Commentator and the contributions of his correspondents that its intended publication is for the present laid aside The appearance however of a mutilated  playhouse  copy under the auspices of the MANAGERS from whose affected veneration for Shakespeare better things might have been expected has not only alarmed the poet's admirers in general but suggested that some pertinent observations on his writings might be now opportunely communicated to the public in a more entertaining method Dr K desirous of returning by the earliest means the obligations he lies under to his subscribers has therefore adopted the suggested expedient of delivering some part of his comment with the correspondent parts of the text in public Lectures  He has entered indeed the more readily into this design as there are a number of passages in dramatic writers particularly in Shakespeare which cannot be successfully elucidated without the aid of declamation As to the title which he has too quaintly perhaps presumed to give this attempt the public may remember they were promised many years ago the speedy publication of a  work to be entitled A SCHOOL OF SHAKESPEARE but as that performance has not yet appeared and will now probably never make its appearance the Lecturer thinks no farther apology necessary for assuming a title so well adapted to his design  N B The Subscribers to Dr K's Shakespeare will be admitted to the whole course without farther subscription or if dissatisfied may have their former subscription returned  {inverted ‚ÅÇ}The communications of critical readers tending to throw such lights on the poetical or moral beauties of Shakespeare as may have escaped his commentators will be gratefully received and properly applied  INTRODUCTION  A PROFESSED panegyric on the genius of Shakespeare has been the usual preface to the various editions of his writings A scholiast like a translator is almost universally the encomiast of his author A rhetorical expositor therefore will not be expected to break through a custom which affords so great a scope for declamation But to recite what has been often written will yield little satisfaction to my auditors and to advance any thing new on a subject which has employed the pens of the greatest wits for almost two centuries past is an attempt above my presumption For though too much cannot be said in praise of our incomparable poet it may be impertinent to attempt to say more than has already been so well said by others Formal encomiums resemble mere compliments which are the more futile and superfluous as they rather tend to depreciate than enhance extraordinary merit  It will I flatter myself be a more entertaining and useful task to exemplify the particular excellencies which justify our  universal admiration of this favourite bard than to expatiate in general terms on his superiority of genius General admirers are caught by superficial attractions and however enthusiastic their devotion it usually depends on the slightness of their acquaintaince with the object of their idolatry  Pools  may ADMIRE but  men of sense  APPROVE  Approbation therefore must second out  applause  to give it sterling value and prove our attachment realBut to  approve  we must  understand  and fully to understand so comprehensive and sublime a writer as Shakespeare is perhaps not quite so easy as is generally imagined At least there are many and those  not uncritical  readers who are ingenious enough to confess that after repeated perusals of his works they seldom recur to him without meeting with some new difficulty to surmount or excellence to admire  Not that I have presumed to invite my auditors to a dull enumeration of  verbal  errors the dry investigation of doubtful phraseology or the ellucidation of obscurities  arising from obsolete diction and vulgar allusions many of them too mean to excite curiosity or too long lost to be worth the labour of researchThanks to the successful industry of more laborious criticks they have released me in a great measure from the painful task of ascertaining ambiguities disentangling intricacies and recovering the meaning of terms long lost in the darkness of antiquity  The text of Shakespeare gives room for a more pleasing and instructive comment The poetical beauties and defects of this wonderful bard whose works are allowed to afford the most numerous as well as conspicuous instances of both fall under the immediate cognizance of the liberal scholiast Hence Mr Pope affirms that his writings not only present the fairest and fullest subject of criticism but that to criticise on them effectually would be the best method to form the judgment and taste of our nationThis were an arduous attempt indeed An attempt in which so many of the leviathans of literature have failed that it might be justly deemed arrogance in me to resume it  It is near twenty years since the admirers of Shakespeare were publickly addressed in favour of an Editor possessed of a genius of which it was said as of Caesar  The Alps and Pyreneans sink before it  From him we were promised an edition w  y of the author and himself in w  the beauties of the former were to be pointed out agreeably to the sublime imagination of the editor who had confessedly all the requisite qualifications of a great critic  Quid dignum tanto seret hic promissor hiatu  NothingThe promiser was no prophet this mighty genius after buoying up the public expectation for about ten years most egregiously failed in the execution of his design His edition had hardly appeared before a new one was set on foot by the very proprietors who had employed him soliciting eleemosynary contributions which were levied in much about the same time with success on the public  In this last compilation which to the honour of the conductor may be stiled a  stupendous monument of verbal criticism almost every thing is done but that which seems most wanted an illustration of the poetical beauties and moral excellencies of the writer This was deemed so essentially necessary by Mr Pope and Dr Warburton that they thought it incumbent on them to distinguish by their manner of printing the more striking passages of the author so as to arrest the attention of the indolent and direct the judgment of the ignorant reader  Dr Johnson indeed censures this practice as useless or rather hurtful Its only effect says he is to preclude the pleasure of judging for ourselves to teach the young and ignorant to decide without principles to defeat curiosity and discernment by leaving them less to discover and at last to shew the opinion of the critick without the reasons on which it was founded and without affording any light by which it may be examined  In the course of the present Lectures which are offered however as a mite only into the general treasury of exposition I shall endeavour to shun this cause of censure by laying down the principles  and giving such reasons of approbation or censure as may enable my auditors to judge for themselves without preventing the exercise of their own curiosity or altogether depriving them of that selfcomplacency which attends the congratulation of one's own discernment  It were to supersede the expediency of all classical exposition should we adopt the maxim "that a reader is never pleased with the meaning of a writer unless it be immediately obvious to his own apprehension"  Yet such is the assertion of that learned commentator who insists on the facility of comprehending the works of Shakespeare in the following terms of amplification  A description of the obvious scenes of nature a representation of general life a sentiment of reflection or experience a deduction of conclusive argument a sorcible eruption of effervescent passion are to be considered as proportionate to common apprehension unassisted by critical officiousness since to conceive them nothing is more requisite than acquaintance with the general state of the world and those  faculties which he must almost bring with him who would read Shakespeare  But granting that Shakespeare's reflections reasonings and representations were universally obvious and that persons of every capacity possess the faculties of comprehending them it is not so much the exertion of abilities as of attention that is in this case required The poet can be but halfread by halfreaders for the works of Shakespeare will by no means rank with those frivolous productions which our English Aristophanes facetiously calls pretty light summer reading  Pope in his Essay on Criticism says we should read  a work of wit  With the same spirit that its author writ  To do justice to the poet and ourselves therefore in the reading of Shakespeare we should summon up all our attention to his subject The immediate comprehension of flights of genius and force of argument requires that both the imagination and judgment should be wide awake It is not enough that the eye of an indolent reader run carelessly over the page of such  a writer to take in at so cursory a view the full extent of his meaning Even a more intent peruser will sometimes fail to seize in a moment that combination of ideas which may have cost the mod ready writer the labour of days weeks months to collect compare and combine  Congenial talents it is true like drops of a similar fluid readily coalesce men of the same turn for observation and of similar modes of thinking easily understand each other but this is not the case with others who differ as well in opinion as intellectual abilities To superior geniuses who may themselves affect to vie with the great master of our English drama my lectures may afford as little instruction as amusement But in this extensive metropolis I presume there are to be found a sufficient number of his more humble admirers to whom they may prove both acceptable and useful however futile or frivolous they may seem to men of superlative ingenuity  As to the expediency of their oral delivery it may be pleaded that the proprieties of dramatic composition strike more forcibly from recital than in perusal The  ablest commentator on Shakespeare might discover in the declamation of a Quin or a Garrick many exquisite strokes of character passion and humour evidently designed by the poet which yet Would otherwise escape the notice of the mere literary critick Nay it is even possible that the poet himself who it must be remembered was but an indifferent stageplayer did not intend all those nice touches and forcible strokes of expression which an able actor or artful declaimer might by propriety of pause significance of tone and variety of cadence give his writings in recital  This may seem an heresy too bold to come from an orthodox admirer of Shakespeare especially if we admit the justice of the ingenious encomium passed on him by one of his latest and best commentators Shakespeare says she for we are told the encomiast is a Lady seems to have had the art of the dervise in the Arabian tales who could throw his soul into the body of another man and be at once possessed of his sentiments adopt his passions and rise to all the functions and feelings of his situation  But perhaps this elegant eulogy though supported by as beautiful and pertinent an allusion may be no farther applicable than to the sentimental powers of the writer and not to the correspondent sensations or in Dr Johnson's phrase effervescent passions of the man The poet like the dervise might be able to throw his soul into the unanimated body of another without being able to accommodate his own body to the feelings and passions of another's soul in which case however justly he might speak the general language of those passions he might still learn something from those who could feel as they spoke from themselves If the Ghost in Hamlet as we are told was the best part his powers of declamation could arrive at he could not personally assume the characters or display the feelings he so pathetically describes while he dictates their proper language to others  But be this as it may with respect to Shakespeare it is well known to have been the case with many modern authors who have been astonished at the latent meaning that has been discovered in their compositions by a Garrick a Clive or a Pritchard It even happens in composition that a sense  more pertinent sublime or profound than at first intended is often struck out by a happy collision of words as unforeseen as unpremeditated If passages of this kind are sometimes fortuitously suggested to the writer how much oftener will his genius or art designedly present them to the reader who is not to be wondered at if he content himself with the more obvious meaning that floats on the surface without diving into the depths of his author  A line or two from almost any classical writer will afford an exemplary instanceIn Iago's celebrated speech on the inestimable value of a good name he says  Who steals my  purse  steals  trash  'Tis something nothing  'Twas  mine  'tis  his  and has been  slave  to  thousands  I believe such in general is the manner in which those lines are repeated And yet there seems to be a want of meaning in the words  something nothing  so delivered The antithesis in the second line also is confined to the various possessors in the words  mine his  and  thousands  Whereas if we conceive the speaker to pause on calling  his  purse trash  then to admit it to be  something  or make it a question and afterwards go on as if upon farther thought more forcibly to undervalue it by calling it expressly  nothing  the sense would be greatly improved Again if we extend the antithesis in the second line or rather distinguish another between the words  'Twas 'tis  and  has been  denoting the futility of the possission as merely temporary and transitory the passage would in this case be much more pregnant of meaning  Who steals my  purse  steals  trash  'Tis  something  Nothing  'TWAS  mine  'TIS  his  and HAS BEEN slave to  thousands  A similar instance of the double antithesis is to be found in the first hook of Milton's Paradise Lost where Satan says it is  Better to  reign  in  Hell  than  serve  in  Heaven  If I remember right Mr Quin as well as some other celebrated readers of Milton gave no farther meaning or energy to this line although it is evident from the context that the antithesis is double and requires  a farther distinction of emphasis between  reigning  in  Hell  and  serving  in  Heaven  The fallen spirit is addressing his companion in revolt on the subject of their new abode the infernal world of which having taken a survey he thus exclaims  Here at least  We shall be free th' Almighty  will not drive us hence  Here we may reign secure and in my choice  To reign is worth ambition tho' in Hell  Better to REIGN in  Hell  than SERVE in  Heaven  Innumerable are the passages in poetical and particularly dramatic compositions where the whole meaning of the writer is not more obvious to the reader nor more easily explained without the aid of declamation which when it is just and emphatical renders farther explanation unnecessary A proper tho' simple recital of the text is hence often a better comment than whole pages of written annotations  A judicious actor is therefore the best expositor of the drama We have a striking instance of this in Mr Garrick who is not improperly stiled a living comment on our author What a pity that out of  so great a number of capital parts as are found in the plays of Shakespeare the walk of this great comedian has of late years at least been confined to about twelve characters in tragedy and I think to one only in comedy Benedict  Had all the principal personages in the dramas of our immortal poet the advantage of the living comment of such an excellent actor it would have effectually precluded the present undertaking But when so few of them are capitally filled and the greater part of the rest injudiciously shortened with a view to accommodate them to the incapacities of inferior performers it is doing a piece of justice to the poet to endeavour to rescue his mangled remains from such injurious mutilators My auditors will excuse me however if I do not affect the grimace and roar of the lock or the rant and whine of the buskin If I have voice enough to make myself distinctly heard and sufficient art in the management of it to convey the meaning of the poet the end I propose will be answered in giving some satisfaction to his admirers and if to them to the public  at large for who is not an admirer of Shakespeare  Admirable as he is to be regarded as a poet there is also another light in which he is seldom presented to us tho' he appears in it if possible to still greater advantage This is that of a  moral philosopher  his works containing a practical system of ethics the more instructive and useful as the precept is almost every where joined to example His moral reflections are not like those of most other playwrights an adventitious appendage to the dialogue On the contrary they rise naturally from the situation and circumstance of the speaker and flow spontaneously from his lips as the genuine effusions of his heart Hence it is that they make so forcible and lasting an impression on the memory and have perhaps contributed more to form our national character for humanity justice and benevolence than all the theoretical books of morality which have appeared in our language  I am not singular in admiring this great poet as a philosopher The learned and ingenious Mrs Montague observes in like  manner that "we are apt to consider Shakespeare only as a poet but he is certainly one of the greatest moral philosophers that ever lived" The testimony of Mr Pope on this head does the poet the highest honour "Shakespeare" say he "is not more a master of the Great than of the Ridiculous in human nature of our noblest tendernesses than of our vainest foibles of our strongest emotions than of our idlest sensationsNor does he only excel in the passions in the coolness of reflection and reasoning he is full as admirable His sentiments on every subject are not only in general the most pertinent and judicious hut by a talent very peculiar something between penetration and felicity he hits on that particular point on which the bent of each argument turns or the force of each motive depends" Were any thing wanting more conclusive we might recur to the character given of this sublime genius by one little his inserior Mr Dryden "Shakespeare" says he "was the man who of all modern and perhaps ancient poets had the largest and most comprehensive soul"My auditors I am persuaded will agree therefore with me that the understanding of English and even  a slight acquaintance with the author's stile and phraseology is insufficient to enable the generality of readers to enter fully into his sense and spirit without much attention and more mature reflection than is usually bestowed on dramatic productions  I shall hence wave farther apology as needless either for this mode of comment or for making the School of Shakespeare not a school of verbal criticism and theatrical declamation but of  poetical propriety  and MORAL PHILOSOPHY  A RETORT COURTEOUS ON THE CRITICKS  THE respect which individuals owe to public opinion especially when they solicit the public patronage reduces them to the necessity of considering every thing as important which regards the merit of their pretensions It is this necessity that renders the remarks of writers otherwise insignificant deserving notice Contemptible as are frequently the anonymous correspondents of newspapers there is scarce a reader in town to whom some one or other of those papers does not appear an oracle In an age so divided between the bustle of business and the dissipation of divertisement it is no wonder that curiosity should adopt the means of acquiring knowledge without the trouble of thinking Our daily chronicles pretend to offer those means and are therefore revered of course as oracular Liable however to be deceived either by ignorance or design their decisions like those of the  oracles of old should be trusted with caution  Interested in the effect of those decisions respecting the present undertaking it is incumbent on me to mention their mistake expose their errour and correct their misconception Not that I have reason to complain that the majority or the most respectable of our diurnal critics have not passed sufficient encomiums on my first Lecture The misfortane of it is they have most of them applauded and censured in the wrong place seeming not to have entered fully into my designThe most general objection is that I am deficient in oratory and that I cannot "with the true stagemechanism of proper emphasis recite Shakespeare's versification" To this I answer that I neither pretend to nor require the peculiar talents of an orator or actor to deliver a declamatory comment on that poet I affect not the grace but aim merely at the propriety of declamation as it is by conviction and not persuasion that I would with to affect my auditors Did I pretend to oratory I should take the trouble to commit my discourse as well as all the passages I recite to memory so as to be able to repeat them by rote and assume the different characters  of the respective speakers without which it is impossible to deliver them oratorially and the talk of speaking with energy and propriety for two whole hours without book is what I am persuaded my auditors will not think it reasonable to impose on me The critick of the Public Advertiser indeed has furnished me with a better apology on this head than probably I could make for myself He intimates with a perhaps what is certainly true that the Lecturer considers himself rather as a teacher than a practitioner of eloquence as a rhetorical professor rather than a professed orator "It is notorious says the critick that the dancingmaster who teaches the art of address to others is not the most graceful in his own deportment The drawingmaster instructs his pupils also in the rudiments of design not by the delicate touches of the pencil but by the coarse outlines of rough chalk nay we even are told there are musical connoisseurs who would rather hear a tune hummed over by a Bach or an Arne with scarce any voice at all than hear it melodiously warbled by a Linley or a Davis"  Had the criticks in general attended to the motto I have adopted from Horace  signifying that "I meant to do the office of a whetstone which gives an edge to steel without having any itself"  Fungar vice cotis Reddere quaeserrumvalet exsors ipsa secandi  HOR  they must all have coincided with this writer but perhaps some of them did not read it and it is not impossible that being in Latin some others might notunderstand it  As to what has been said about "the  stagemechanism of proper emphasis  " my design is in part to explode the  mechanical emphasis  of the stage as altogether improper It is the habitual exercise of this mode of declamation that misleads the actor from the meaning of the author If while I am endeavouring therefore to point out this meaning merely by a different mode of declamation I am to be judged by the very standard which I am exploding the prepossession of the criticks in favour of theatrical habit places me in a very peculiar predicament The greater the errour I may attempt to correct in stage declaimers the greater the blunder I shall be supposed to have committed myself unless indeed I should trouble my auditors with a comment on every such passage giving the reasons for speaking it differently from others in which case the task I have undertaken  might instead of  fifteen  Lectures require fifty I shall explain this by example  In the tragedy of Macbeth there is a celebrated passage which having long puzzled both the actors and commentators seems at length to have obtained the general sanction of being spoken in a manner the most quaint and absurd imaginable  After the murder of Duncan Macbeth whose hands are still bloody exclaims  Will all great Neptune's  ocean  wash this blood  Clean from my hand No this  my  hand will rather  The multitudinous SEA  incarnadine  Making the Green One Red  The players used to say  The multitudinous  seas  incarnadine  Making the green one red  This the criticks objected to as a bald and puerile mode of expression unworthy of Shakespeare But granting that  making the green one red  is a little bald and puerile the  making the green One red  is full as quaint and childishly affected Multitudinous sea in the singular and  making the Green One Red  were however contended for and adopted  I think first by Mr Murphy afterwards by Mr Sheridan by Mr Macklin and if I rightly remember by Mr Garrick as also by Dr Johnson who reads THY  multitudinous  conceiving the last lines to be an apostrophe to NeptuneMr Steevens reads the  multitudinous  SEAS in the plural still making the green One redIn my manuscript text I read partly with one and partly with the other thinking with Dr Johnson it may be  thy  and with Mr Steevens that it should be  seas  in the plural at the same time differing with both as to the  green's  being converted into  red  Mr Steevens indeed tells us that the same thought occurs in an old play called the Downfall of the Earl of Huntingdon  He made the  green sea red  with Turkish blood  But with due deference to Mr Steevens the thought is not the same if we read "making the green One red" there is no glaring absurdity though there is much bombast in the notion of a green sea being turned by a bloody hand into a red one but there is as palpable an impropriety in idea as impossibility in fact for green in the abstract to be turned by any means into red A green sea may become a red  sea but green the colour itself can never become red besides the epithet multitudinous appears in this case to be merely expletive and useless especially if it be supposed to mean as our Dictionaries citing this very passage explain it "the having the appearance of or looking like a multitude" For why looking like a multitude Such an epithet applied to the sea has here no propriety whatever But if we take it in the sense in which Shakespeare uses the same word elsewhere as meaning manifold various of different kinds c there is the utmost propriety in itThe colour of blood being the predominant idea in the mind of Macbeth it is plain he means by multitudinous sea or rather seas the manycoloured or variouslycoloured seas Geographers have their Black Sea their White Sea their Red Sea And though a natural philosopher should question whether those seas took their name from the different colours of their waters poetical licence will sufficiently justify our author in alluding to their appellation nay without having recourse to poetical licence or resting on nominal qualities Shakespeare might as a naturalist advert to the occasional variegation really effected in the colour of the sea by floods currents and other  causes all which however being little and partial in comparison of the main ocean whose constant and general colour is green Macbeth is made by a very natural and easy climax to insinuate that his hand will not only incarnadine any particular sea of what colour soever it be occasionally tinged but that it will change even the native colour of the general concourse of waters the main ocean the GREEN  sea  red  I therefore read the passage thus  Will all great Neptune's  ocean  wash this blood  Clean from my hand No this  my  hand will rather  Thy multitudinous  seas incarnadine  Making the GREEN one red  Now whither I am right or wrong in the explication of this passage I should read it in this manner so that if unapprized of my reasons for it the sagacious critics who have so greatly mistaken my design would in all probability think I had committed a blunder for want of the  stagemechanism  of  proper emphasis  From this instance taken from many hundreds of the like nature that might be given may be deduced a sufficient reason why I should not effect the graces of elocution were I even possessed  of the powers and talents for displaying them and this is that the strong and pointed mode of artificial declamation which is necessary to convey and enforce any new or uncommon meaning by words already well known and supposed to be perfectly understood is incompatible with the graceful cadence and voluble flow of oratory  This with the foregoing example taken from Othello may serve to shew the  reader  also the expediency of an  oral  comment on the poet it being impossible for the  writer  to convey by letters the emphasis and tones made use of by the  speaker  In a commentator it is necessary that he should investigate and disclose all the sense and meaning contained in his author An orator who speaks in his own character or an actor who personates that of another and would appear the man he represents should attempt to convey no more sentiment than he can accompany with sensibility On the stage we had rather lose sight of the author than the actor who should make every thing his own and mean no more than he can deliver with gracefulness and ease An actor therefore would sometimes do well designedly to sink a quaint or latent sense in a sentence overcharged  with meaning rather than sacrifice the gracefulness of delivery and propriety of representation to the precise expression of a particular idea when the general meaning is natural and sufficiently full and charracteristick without it  Enacting words says the late ingenious author of the Actor is labour too minute  A commentator on the other hand cannot be too particular precise and pointed inhis emphasis even though a dissonant or deficient voice should subject him to the implication or wanting what he ought not to exert if he had them  oratorial abilities  It is not merely as an orator however that I have been censured by the criticks I have been charged as a commentator with having grossly mistaken my author in clearing the character of Sir John Falstaff of imputed malignity of disposition and in describing him as a  harmless inoffensive jocular  creature A writer in the Public ledger advances this charge among other nmrepresentations in that paper of Thursday last  That Falstaff is a  jocular  creature is universally admitted but that he is  harmless  and  inoffensive  is what neither I nor I believe any body else ever before suggested For my own part I neither palliated his meanness nor extenuated his vices but left him in full possession of his character for gluttony lying cowardice and theft This sagacious critick therefore must be a great latitudinarian in morals and have adopted a very singular system of ethicks if he holds that a man who is at once a glutton a liar a coward and a thies is a harmless inoffensive creature  I will appeal therefore to my auditors whether I have not reason to expect that criticks who can so readily overlook the vices of mankind should have a little more candour toward their soibles and defects They forget that I told them my lectures were not calculated for auditors of superlative ingenuity but for such only as are modest enough to think that the poet whose intellectual eye in a fine phrenzy rolling could dart from heaven to earth from earth to heaven may have sometimes seen farther than is commonly descried by the mental opticks of unpoetical or uncritical readers  ADDITION TO THE RETORT COURTEOUS  SUCH is the Retort Courteous to the criticks which I had the honour of reading to my auditors last Wednesday to which so many objections and of which so many misrepresentations have been since made in the public papers that it becomes necessary for me to make their authors some reply  I have in the first place been charged with affecting a sovereign contempt for newspaper animadversions and yet stooping so low as to profit by them in improving by the advice they contained But surely my thinking them at first worth my animandversion is a proof that the contempt supposed to be affected was not quite so sovereign as alledged especially as I am said to have thought them of still so much more consequence as to prosit by them It were cruel to deny the authors of these  animadversions the honour of having contributed to my improvement while they admit I am improved I am conscious however of that improvement's being so very little that it does neither them nor me any great credit  But though they admit I have improved by them they seem determined not to improve by me They allow that my remarks are ingenious but not convincing the critics or rather critic for like sovereign princes they each write in the royal plurality of we us and ourselvesOne of these critics in particular whom I distinguish as much for his superiour ingenuousness as ingenuity admits that my reading of the passage cited from Macbeth is defended in a plausible manner but that he I should say they are nevertheless not converts to the doctrine as they think such reading exceedingly puerile bald and improper As to its baldness and puerility I shall not attempt to controvert a matter of elegance and taste but I cannot help remarking as something whimsical a critic's calling any expression improper who at the same time contends for the propriety of saying that the colour green may become red He might as well  say black may become white nay better for black and white are only the extremes of light and shade merely colourable accidents and not like green and red genuine and natural colours  Green is at least a secondary if not a primary colour    This critic says  A good logician will be able by sophistry and the artifice of words to cheat the senses  But a good logician never uses sophistry or the artifice of words so that what he charges on a good logician proves that he means a bad one Again he says  none but the weak will give up an opinion which was rationally founded on hearing the specious argument of an able casuist  This is to suppose that a weak man is better able to found a rational opinion or judge when it is so founded than an able casuist The truth indeed is that the weak in judgment are generally the most strong in opinion for as Shakespeare says  Conceit the strongest works in weakest minds  Or not to go out of the line of the critic's reading as it is observed to the same purpose in the air of a well known Burletta  Remember when the judgment's weak that prejudice is strong  I do not wonder therefore that our critic even though he has considered as he says and reconsidered the point should still remain in his former sentiments Had he given any hint of the manner in which he investigated this knotty point one might judge of the depth and acuteness of his enquiry and of the grounds of his tenaciousness of opinion As it is he has lest the point as much in the dark as he found it I will endeavour therefore to elucidate it a little farther The main difficulty seems to lie in the meaning of the epithet multitudinous which Macbeth gives to the sea  Now to come at the meaning of doubtful words in an author there are only two ways the one by enquiring in what sense they are used by the same and contemporary writers and the other by entering fully into the sentiment and explaining them by their necessary connexion with the context For we must not arbitrarily give such words the meaning we may take it into our heads suits best with the sense that we give as arbitrarily to the passage This were only to make one blunder give sanction to another  Now according to the former mode of explanation multitudinous means as before observed looking like a multitude also manifold and various Shakespeare calls the  tongue  multitudinous meaning multifarious speaking many things or many languages But neither in Shakespeare nor in any of his contemporary writers do we find multitudinous used in any sense that will justify the various suppositions that Macbeth here gives it to the sea because as some say the sea has many waves or as others because it has many bays creeks and harbours or because as others will have it it contains shoals of herrings and multitudes of mackrel  Attending to the second mode of explanation we should enter into the sentiment and place ourselves in the situation of the speaker assume his personage and ask ourselves what we should have said in the same Circumstances The whole attention of Macbeth was engrossed with the sight of his bloody hands His whole thoughts intent on the means of clearing them of that carnadine hue they were so deeply dyed with so deep indeed that he says all Neptune's ocean will not wash them clean Nay rather these hands will incarnadine  Neptune's seas Is it reasonable to suppose that in this agitation of mind Macbeth could advert to any other property of those seas than that which immediately related to the object before him Would he call the sea multitudinous because it contained a multitude of fish as if he were the busybrain'd projector of a British fishery Impossible It is for those reasons I continue still as firmly fixed in my opinion as the critic in his to whom however being open to conviction I shall be ready to give it up if after having really considered and reconsidered the point he puts on his considering cap once again and gives me a better reason for his opinion than I have given for mine  To the critic of the Publick Ledger I am indebted for the misrepresentation of almost every thing he hath noticed particularly for falsely charging me with adopting the meanings I explode and altering the text ot Shakespeare to countenance explanations which I deduce from that text's standing as it docs These misrepresentations are the more injurious as they subject me to unjust censure and expose me to unmerited ridicule If they proceed  therefore from the critic's having unfortunately a treacherous memory and to his liberal propensity to do me on all occasions a good turn I hope he will for the future speak truth and I am armed against his malevolence It is this writer who repeatedly informs the publick that the ladies yawn as he elegantly expresses it at my lecture for want of wit and musick But after such bad proofs as he has given of his veracity he will give me leave to doubt the fact for tho' this gentleman may require a jig or a pun to prevent his falling asleep I have too good an opinion of my fair auditors to suppose they cannot be kept two or three hours awake by a comment on Shakespeare without the aid of a jest or the squeaking of a fiddle Indeed I could not conceive that a critic could suppose my lectures calculated for such auditors as can be amused with the entertainment they now meet with at the playhouses and the puppetshews  To the Public Advertiser Gazetteer and most of the evening papers I am obliged for their truth their impartiality and their candour  There is also a morning paper which has honoured me nearly as much by its abuse but I have too much respect for my auditors to notice any thing inserted in the Morning Post which indiscriminately abusing every body may be aptly enough said to have a tongue that utters no slander  Indeed I beg pardon of my auditors for engaging their attention so long on the mistakes of verbal criticks and the wilful misrepresentation of mere wordcatchers The subject of tonight's lecture is of more importance and will therefore be more serious than I propose to make the School of Shakespeare in general If I should happen however to be too grave for my auditors to night I may make them amends another time by more frequent flashes of Shakespeare's merriment At the same time I must beg leave to observe that as I intend with a view to have this undertaking more generally comprehended to publish my Introductory Address and Reply to the Criticks in a printed pamphlet I mean with the consent of my auditors to recite them no more not take any farther notice  in this place of the newspaper remarks as it would lead me into a field of altercation too wide to be comprized within the limits of my present plan If my auditors however should have any questions to propose respecting the elucidation of Shakespeare and will take the trouble to reduce them to writing I shall endeavour to give them after due consideration a satisfactory answer  FINIS  BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS BY W KENRICK LL D  Epistles to Lorenzo philosophical and
