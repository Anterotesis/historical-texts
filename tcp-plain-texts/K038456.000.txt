 ISIS AN ELEGY  Price SixPence  ISIS AN ELEGY  Written in the Year By Mr  MASON      SOPHOCLES in Antig  LONDON Printed for R DODSLEY at Tully's Head in PallMall and Sold by M COOPER in Paternoster Row  MDCCXLIX  Advertisement  THE following Poem would never have appeared in print had not an interpolated copy of it published in a country newspaper scandalously misrepresented the principles of the Author  ISIS  FAR from her hallow'd grot where mildly bright  The pointed crystals shot their trembling light  From dripping moss where sparkling dewdrops fell  Where coral glow'd where twin'd the wreathed shell  Pale  Isis  lay a willow's lowly shade  Spread it's thin foliage o'er the pensive maid  Clos'd was her eye and from her heaving breast  In careless folds loose flow'd her zoneless vest  While down her neck her vagrant tresses flow  In all the awful negligence of woe  Her urn sustain'd her arm that sculptur'd vase  Where  Vulcan  's art had lavish'd all it's grace  Here full with life was heav'ntaught Science seen  Known by the laurel wreath and musing mein  There cloudcrown'd Fame here Peace sedate and bland  Swell'd the loud trump and wav'd the olive wand  While solemn domes arch'd shades and vista's green  At wellmark'd distance close the sacred scene  On this the Goddess cast an anxious look  Then dropt a tender tear and thus she spoke  Yes I cou'd once with pleas'd attention trace  The mimic charms of this prophetic vase  Then lift my head and with enraptur'd eyes  View on yon plain the real glories rise  Yes  Isis  oft hast thou rejoic'd to lead  Thy liquid treasures o'er yon fav'rite mead  Oft hast thou stopt thy pearly car to gaze  While ev'ry Science nurs'd it's growing bays  While ev'ry Youth with fame's strong impulse fir'd  Prest to the goal and at the goal untir'd  Snatch'd each celestial wreath to bind his brow  The Muses Graces Virtues cou'd bestow  E'en now fond Fancy leads th'ideal train  And ranks her troops on Mem'ry's ample plain  See the firm leaders of my patriot line  See SIDNEY RALEIGH HAMDEN SOMERS shine  See HOUGH superior to a tyrant's doom  Smile at the menace of the slave of Rome  Each soul whom truth cou'd fire or virtue move  Each breast strong panting with it's country's love  All that to  Albion  gave the heart or head  That wisely councell'd or that bravely bled  All all appear on me they grateful smile  The wellearn'd prize of every virtuous toil  To me with filial reverence they bring  And hang fresh trophies o'er my honour'd spring  Ah I remember well yon beachen spray  There ADDISON first tun'd his polish'd lay  'Twas there great  Cato  's form first met his eye  In all the pomp of freeborn majesty  "My Son he cry'd observe this mein with awe  "In solemn lines the strong resemblance draw  "The piercing notes shall strike each  British  ear  "Each  British  eye shall drop the patriot tear  "And rous'd to glory by the nervous strain  "Each Youth shall spurn at slav'ry's abject reign  "Shall guard with  Cato  's zeal  Britannia  's laws  "And speak and act and bleed in freedom's cause"  The Hero spoke the Bard assenting bow'd  The lay to liberty and  Cato  flow'd  While Echo as she rov'd the vale along  Join'd the strong cadence of his  Roman  song  But ah how Stillness slept upon the ground  How mute Attention check'd each rising sound  Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray  Scarce trill'd sweet  Philomel  her softest lay  When LOCKE walk'd musing forth e'en now I view  Majestic Wisdom thron'd upon his brow  View Candour smile upon his modest cheek  And from his eye all Judgment's radiance break  'Twas here the sage his manly zeal exprest  Here stript vain Falshood of her gaudy vest  Here Truth's collected beams first fill'd his mind  E'er long to burst in blessings on mankind  E'er long to show to reason's purged eye  That "NATURE'S FIRST BEST GIFT WAS LIBERTY"  Proud of this wond'rous son sublime I stood  While louder surges swell'd my rapid flood  Then vain as  Niobe  exulting cry'd  Ilissus  roll thy fam'd  Athenian  tide  Tho'  Plato  's steps oft mark'd thy neighb'ring glade  Tho' fair  Lycaeum  lent it's awful shade  Tho' ev'ry  Academic  green imprest  It's image full on thy reflecting breast  Yet my pure stream shall boast as proud a name  And  Britain  's  Isis  flow with  Attic  fame  Alas how chang'd where now that  Attic  boast  See  Gothic  Licence rage o'er all my coast  See Hydra Faction spread it's impious reign  Poison each breast and madden ev'ry brain  Hence frontless crouds that not content to fright  The blushing  Cynthia  from her throne of night  Blast the fair face of day and madly bold  To Freedom's foes infernal orgies hold  To Freedom's foes ah see the goblet crown'd  Hear plausive shouts to Freedom's foes resound  The horrid notes my refluent waters daunt  The Echoes groan the Dryads quit their haunt  Learning that once to all diffus'd her beam  Now sheds by stealth a partial private gleam  In some lone cloister's melancholy shade  Where a firm few support her sickly head  Despis'd insulted by the barb'rous train  Who scour like  Thracia  's moonstruck rout the plain  Sworn foes like them to all the Muse approves  All  Phoebus  favours or  Minerva  loves  Are these the sons my fost'ring breast must rear  Grac'd with my name and nurtur'd by my care  Must these go forth from my maternal hand  To deal their insults thro' a peaceful land  And boast while Freedom bleeds and Virtue groans  That "  Isis  taught Rebellion to her Sons"  Forbid it heav'n and let my rising waves  Indignant swell and whelm the recreant slaves  In  England  's cause their patriot floods employ  As  Xanthus  delug'd in the cause of  Troy    Is this deny'd then point some secret way  Where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray  Some unknown channel lend where nature spreads  Inglorious vales and unfrequented meads  There where a Hind scarce tunes his rustic strain  Where scarce a Pilgrim treads the pathless plain  Content I'll flow forget that e'er my tide  Saw yon majestie structures crown its side  Forget that e'er my wrapt attention hung  Or on the Sage's or the Poet's tongue  Calm and resign'd my humbler lot embrace  And pleas'd prefer oblivion to disgrace  FINIS
