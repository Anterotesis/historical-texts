FROM FINE AND LIVING SPECIMENS  BY E DONOVAN F L S  IN FIVE VOLUMES VOL I  LONDON  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND FOR F AND C RIVINGTON No ST PAUL'S CHURCHYARD  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Work being now completed we conceive our engagement with the Subscribers is in every respect fulfilled and that it only remains to embrace this opportunity to repeat our thanks for their favours and in particular for the candour with which the Supplementary Part has been received  But in submitting the work to the Public in general as an illustration of an important branch of British Zoology it is incumbent on us to state briefly the nature and extent of the undertaking the information it contains and its peculiar advantages In this retrospective survey of the work we must advert to our former observations some similar re∣marks appeared at the conclusion of the fourth volume and we retrace those as they immediately relate to the outline of our design  Ornithology as a science has undergone various altera∣tions and improvements different authors have submitted their systems to the world and each has found its admirers and opponents nor has the unrivalled genius of Linnaeus devised an arrangement in which those opposite opinions may be reconciled On the importance of Ornithology in the great scale of animated nature no difference of opinion can prevail The beauty and elegance of the feathered race their pleasing and various melody their sagacity and trac∣table manners has been admired in every age and country and their unerring oeconomy and instinct has ever engaged the attention of the moral philosopher The Birds of this country are of plainer colours than those of warmer climates but they are not less interesting to the English naturalist If in some instances their beauty has little claim to our no∣tice in others it excites our admiration and to the intelli∣gent mind their beauty their singularities peculiar manners and oeconomy are equally engaging They are the source of information and improvement to the practical Ornithologist and of rational and agreeable amusement to every common observer of nature  At the commencement of this work it was our intention to form a complete History of British Ornithology and to include figures of all the known Birds amounting to more than two hundred and fifty species but we have since con∣ceived it would be advisable to select only the more beau∣tiful  Birds in addition to those which are interesting to the naturalist for a considerable number of the British species are so well known that their history would be tedious and the figures unnecessary in a work professedly designed to treat of the most remarkable species only Not that we have entirely overlooked the common Birds in several in∣stances some of these are introduced also to point out their singular habits of life and other interesting peculiarities but in general we have endeavoured to form an instructive as well as amusing illustration of this department of Natural History  It will perhaps be contended that a complete collection of figures and descriptions of all the British Birds would be more acceptable than any partial selection however com∣prehensive We admit the propriety of this objection but must observe that such addition would considerably increase the expense to the purchaser and scarcely contri∣bute to his information On the other hand this work in its present limits may assist the researches of the uninformed naturalist and tend to promote a deeper and more extensive enquiry into this branch of science It embraces in one view the whole of those British Birds that are scarcely known and of which the inquisitive reader under many circum∣stances may be desirous of information We have omitted many of those Birds which constantly inhabit this country but have included all local species and in particular those  whose haunts and breeding places are difficult of access and the Birds in consequence little known The extensive marshes and lowlands in some parts of the kingdom are the retreats and breeding places of certain species Those solitary kinds which retire to the depths and gloomy re∣cesses of forests are rarely observed and many of those which seek the open plain for security elude our vigilance and are not better known But the rarest of the local kinds are of the rapacious and gallinaceous tribes which never leave their dreary solitudes their wilds and barren moun∣tains in the north to visit the southern parts of Great Bri∣tain The migratory Birds are numerous and include many well known species with others that are uncommonly scarce We have taken an extensive variety of the beautiful Land Birds that resort to this country occasionally from the south of Europe and of the aquatic or webfooted tribe that are driven by the severity of the winter in the Arctic regions to seek shelter on our shores History and tradition inform us of other Birds that formerly inhabited these king∣doms but are now extirpated and these form an interesting sequel to this selection We cannot vindicate the pro∣priety of introducing naturalized exotic species amongst these though they are arranged by our Naturalists in the British Ornithology and in some instances we have fol∣lowed their authority for the sake of embellishment and variety  In the course of publication we have been fortunate in procuring specimens of many uncommon Birds Among the most remarkable are  The Rosecoloured Ouzel Roller Little Bittern Waxen Chatterer Black Woodpecker  and in particular that rare and almost unknown species the  Wood ChatThe Rednecked Grebe Dartford Warbler Dusky Lark Longlegged Plover Egret  and  Cock of the Wood  We could enumerate many other species highly important to the uninformed naturalist but we refer our readers for the general detail to the complete Systematic Arrangement an∣nexed to this Advertisement  In this Systematic Arrangement we have followed the  Systema Naturae  of Linnaeus though we totally dissent from the opinion of that celebrated naturalist in his primary divisions of Ornithology In every system the Birds which inhabit the land only are separated from such as frequent the water This appears to be a natural method of forming two principal divisions of Ornithology it was adopted by Ray and approved by Pennant and Latham In the Linnaean system those which inhabit the water are separated from the rest but the Land Birds are divided into two parts and the Water Birds are placed between them To avoid con∣fusion we have adhered to this arrangement but we have also placed an Index in the manner of Pennant and Latham at the conclusion of each volume  Having endeavoured to explain the nature and extent of this undertaking we submit the whole to the candour of the Public and though not indifferent to the flattering testimony of approbation it has received in the course of five years publication we entreat indulgence for whatever may be thought exceptionable either in the outline of our under∣taking the selection of species or the manner in which they are illustrated To our Subscribers we shall not presume to address any apology as their opinion must be already decided The progressive manner in which the work has appeared has afforded every opportunity for cri∣tical examination for detecting error or discovering merit and we trust their continued patronage is some criterion of their approbation and of the general utility of our design  SYSTEMATIC ARRANGEMENT OF SELECT BRITISH BIRDS  ORDER I  ACCIPITRES  Includes the

Titmouse with the Blue Longtailed and Bearded Titmice are the only species of the tribe which inhabit this country they are all very frequent ex∣cepting the latter which however is not uncommon in certain situa∣tions though formerly esteemed as rare  It was described by  Aldrovandus  in his Ornithology published in the years and appears to be well known at that time in se∣veral parts of Europe though unknown in Britain more than a cen∣tury after  Aldrovandus  it was included in a History of the Birds of Germany by  J L Frisch  but even at that time was so rare with us that it was scarcely ascertained to be a native of Britain and Albin who seems to have possessed some knowledge of Birds de∣termines it as a native only on the authority of the information he received from others his History of Birds was published in therein he gives a figure of the Male Bird and says in the Descriptions annexed "These two birds male and female I bought of Mr  Bland  on  Towerhill  who told me he had them from  Jutland  I have been since informed by Sir  Robert Abdy  that they are found in the  Salt∣marshes  in  Essex  and by others that they are likewise in the fens in  Lincolnshire"  He also observes that it receives the name Beardmanica from the black tuft resembling a picked beard  Edwards  G Edwards's Nat Hist of Birds Vol to London c  refers it to the tribe of Butcherbirds under the title of LANIUS  Minimus  Least ButcherBird but Linnaeus in his  Systema Naturae  reduced it to the PARUS genus and late writers have also determined it to the same family  Its length from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail is six inches and a quarter the bill is thick and of a bright yellow colour but fades immediately when the bird dies in the female it is rather dusky and the head which is of a fine grey in the male is of a brownish rust colour spotted with black in the female indeed the female is immediately distinguished by the plainness of her plumage it neither possessing the beautiful purple colour on the breast or the black tufts on the throat which characterizes the male the ventfeathers of the male are pale black of the female light brown as are the other parts of the belly  Pennant in the British Zoology says "This species is found in the marshes near  London  we have seen it near  Gloucester  it is also frequent among the great tracts of reeds near  Cowbit  in  Lincolnshire  where I suspect they breed  Latham in his General Synopsis"These birds are found in England but have hitherto been observed only in marshy situations where  reeds  grow on the seeds of which it feeds as well as small in∣sects both of which have been found in their stomachs They are pretty frequent and in not inconsiderable quantities in the marshes among the reeds between  Erith  and  London  and are again met with in suchlike places near  Gloucester  as well as among the great tracts of reeds near  Cowbit  in  Lincolnshire  In all these places I make no doubt of their breeding as I know that they stay in the firstnamed parts the whole year The nest is not known for certain but I have seen one which was composed of very soft downy materials suspended between three reeds drawn together thought to be the work of that bird"  "They are also common in  Denmark  and  Buffon  supposes that a pair of these having escaped from the cage of the  Countess  of  Albe∣marle  have founded this colony in England This may have been the case in respect to those of  Erith  being on the borders of the  Thames  but will not so well account for their being elsewhere and I am inclined to think that they are indigenous to us and have been so  ab origine  and that it is merely owing to their frequenting such places only where the  reeds  grow that they have been so little known for as those birds never go farther than a few yards from the  beds  "The  reedbeds  frequently cover many acres of ground these grow in the water so as to be overflowed at every tide and few persons ever go near them except in the time of cutting which they do in boats as except at very low tides one can scarce set a footstep within their boundaries"  they have stood a greater chance which has really happened of not being earlier observed"  Kramer  says the nest is built among the  willows  and is of the shape of a purse made of soft downy materials such as the down of the  Greater Cat'sTail  Typha latifolia  Lin  or that of the  Asp  Populus tremula  Lin  hanging the nest on a branch  What new light Mr Latham could throw on this subject is given in the  Supplement  published in the year  "I have never yet been able myself to ascertain the nest and eggs In  Sepp  's  Sepp V  g  pl in p  plate the nest is placed on the  ground  among the  sedges  It is of a very loose texture composed of the tops of dry grass mixed with the seedheads of  rushes  and  reeds  with narrow leaves inter∣mixed The eggs four in number of a reddish white marked with small brown spots"  "This species is found in  Schonen  in Sweden but rarely Is very common about the  Caspian Sea  and  Palus Moeotis  and among the rushes of the rivers which fall into them but in no high latitudes in  Asia  None in Siberia  Arct Zool  "  The male shews much tenderness and care for its young and its mate partakes also of its affection it is said to be ever constant in its attachments

Screch y Coed  Antient British Brit Zool  The Jay though very frequent in every part of the country evi∣dently deserves for the singular beauty of its plumage the first place in a collection of interesting British Birds it is a species however not merely confined to this kingdom but generally diffused over the greater part of the continent of Europe  Among the foreign birds which are referred to this genus are se∣veral species eminently distinguished for their rich and elegant colour∣ing but the European Jay is certainly superior in this particular to many exotics of the same family  Its habits are known in a great degree to resemble those of the Magpie which also belongs to the same genus It will devour with avidity cherries gooseberries raspberries or other fruits but in au∣tumn and winter it feeds on acorns whence it long since derived the name PICA  Glandaria  It is not destitute of a carnivorous ap∣petite as it frequently combats and devours small birds it also feeds on worms and insects  Ablin in Plate Vol very accurately describes the Jay he took his figure from which nearly corresponds with our specimen  "Its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail was fourteen inches its breadth when the wings were extended twentyone inches and an half its weight seven ounces the bill dark ash co∣lour inclining to black strong near an inch and an half long the tongue black thin pellucid and cloven at the tip the irides of the eyes white Near on the lower chap of the bill are two black spots on each side one The chin and lower part of the belly whitish else the breast and belly are of a mixt cinereous and red the rump above is white the back red with a mixture of blue the feathers on the crown of the head variegated with black and white  "The sails of the wings are in number twenty of which the first is shorter by half than the second the fourth the longest being by mea∣sure six inches and a quarter the first or outermost is black the bottom or lower part white which is proper to it alone the six next following have their exterior vanes of an ash colour the three next likewise but more obscure and mingled with blue being also marked toward their bottom with transverse black and white strokes the five succeeding have their exterior vanes half white half black viz the lower half white the upper black but so that each extremity of the white is terminated with blue the sixteenth in place of the white of the four precedent hath transverse blue black and white spots the seventeenth is black having one or two blue spots the eighteenth is black with some little red the nineteenth red with the tip black the under sides of all the feathers of the wing are of a dark or dusky colour the covertfeathers of the fifteen exterior sails are very beautiful being variegated or chequered with black white and lovely shining blue lines the rest of the covertfeathers being black  "The tail is six inches and a quarter long consisting of twelve feathers wholly black except toward their roots under the rump there is something of a blue mingled with cinereous  "The feet and toes are of a ferruginous dusky colour the middle toe is the longest the outmost is equal to the back toe the lower joint of the outmost toe is joined to the middlemost the back claw is the greatest  "The guts are twentyfour inches long the blind guts but half an inch it hath a gall and a long spleen the stomach or gizzard not very fleshy and having its echinus wherein were found acorns c"  He adds "The female differs little or nothing from the male either in bigness or colour so that it is very difficult to know them asunder" but after the publication of his first Volume of Birds he rectifies this error in a supplement which is prefixed to the work "The following observations" says he "I received from Dr Der∣ham after the descriptions were printed He hath observed the Cock Jay Plate Vol to be somewhat bigger than the Hen the feathers on the head to be blacker the stripes longer and the black and blue colours more elegant in the Cock than in the Hen"  Jays generally build in woods preferring a situation near the skirts the nest is composed of fibrous roots and young twigs erected on a base of several large sticks and is placed on the top of a thornbush or other underwood or between the first branches of low decayed trees the female lays five or six eggs of the size of a pigeon's of a cinereous olive colour marked with very pale brown spots the young Jays remain with their parents till the next spring and at the pairing time they each choose his mate to propagate their future progeny  It is a restless and very quarrelsome bird makes a harsh chattering and screaming noise and is ever at variance not only with its own species but with every other inhabitant of the forest when deprived of liberty it may be taught to imitate the human voice but the ori∣ginal appearance of its plumage is so altered by confinement as scarcely to retain any of the beautiful colours which are so emi∣nently conspicuous in the wild state  It is a native of  Denmark  and of  Russia  of  Scotland  and of  England  but does not frequent the islands adjacent  Latham says "The Jay I believe is not spread so far as many others of the genus as we do not hear of its inhabiting further south than  Italy  and  Greece  "This species is common in the woods both of  Russia  and  Siberia  but none beyond the  Lena  Arct Zool    Georgi  mentions it as frequenting the Lake  Baikal  and  Russel  records it as an  Aleppo  species  Hist Alepp p    I have a suspicion also that it extends to  China  as it is to be seen in the drawings of birds from that country  "It is called by the name of  Jay  about  Arragon  in Spain as in  England

opportunity of consulting the original specimen he depended on a drawing done by his friend Mr  G Edwards  and the copy is only a distant imitation of the bird it is defective about the body and ex∣ceedingly incorrect as to the circumference of the neck the account says "Mr  Edwards  discovered this beautiful bird twice in our island near  London  at  Norwood  and another time in  Norfolk"  the figure of this was copied by permission from his beautiful and accurate design which we gratefully acknowledge as well as every other assistance from our worthy friend whose pencil has done so much honour to his country  This bird is the size of a starling eight inches in length bill three quarters of an inch of a fleshcolour with the base reddish irides pale the feathers on the head long

Transactions the name given to it is  sanguineous  we may then conclude that the bird varies much in its rose or pink colour the female also is paler than the male  Mr Latham has added a farther proof of its being found in this country one was shot at  Grantham  in  Lincolnshire  and is now in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks Bart and he says that he is assured of one or more being shot almost every season about  Ormskirk  in  Lan∣cashire  It is more frequent in  France  and is met with in  Burgundy  in its passage to other parts  Aldrovandus  mentions it as not uncommon in Italy where it is called the sea stare and says its usual haunts are among heaps of dung  Aldr Av  II  it is also found in  Switzerland  and  Lapland  but it never passes the limits of that frozen region  Linnaeus

common to  France Austria Italy  and most other parts of Europe and in those countries as with us it appears to be the least native species  But discoveries in the interior parts of  south America  have verified that it is not the least kind existing in that country where the Con∣dor is found the most diminutive species of the feathered tribe are also taken and to those the least European bird bears a gigantic dispropor∣tion for instance the length of the goldencrested Wren is three inches and an half its weight seventysix grains but the total length of the least SouthAmerican Humming bird

forehead and drawing together the feathers which form the black longitudinal band on each side  The colour of the plumage of the female is paler than of the male the crest or feathers on the crown of the head are yellow but without the bright orange colour which softens into the crest of the male  It remains with us through the winter  Latham  IV  frequents woods and builds its nest either in oak fir or yew trees the nest is of a roundish form with an opening on one side it is composed of  moss  and lined within with some downy substance perhaps cobwebs intermixed with small filaments  It lays

webfooted have only three toes all placed forwards and the  Divers  have three toes before and one behind  He therefore thinks that they should be separated and as the form of the feet of this species appears to prevail throughout the genus recommends its being included with the other parts of its essential character he has named his new genus PODICEPS  Pennant has also submitted to a division of the Linnaean  genus  "The  Grebes  and  Divers  are placed in the same genus  i e  of  Colymbi  by  Mr Ray  and  Linnaeus  but the difference of the feet forbade our judicious friend  M Brisson  See

of its migrating into and even breeding in  England  Mr  Latham  has mentioned several "The year seems to have been more abundant in these birds than any I have yet heard of one being shot near  Oxford  on the coast of  Suffolk  in  May  and another seen near the same place the th of  June  following these no doubt had bred thereabouts The place where these were seen was a remarkable barren

Woodford  on  Epping Forest  where they had observed it some time and used all the means to take it they could but it was so shy that it avoided all their traps which were laid for it which the gentleman observing ordered it to be shot it was sent to me to be preserved for him  The cock of this kind I drew from a picture done in  Germany  by a great master there now in the possession of Mr

saw both the drawings of the cock and hen and told me his son shot the cock which was like the drawing at his seat at  Micheler  near  Winchester  in  Hampshire  Albin  Vol II  Latham  observes "it is a solitary bird and seldom more than two are seen together though it is said that in  Egypt  it assembles in small troops It is very common in  Cairo  where it builds in the streets on the terraces of houses c It is also common in the deserts of  Russia  and  Tartary  though scarce beyond the river  Ob  however some are found beyond the  Lake Baikal  Dr  Pallas  confirms the account of the filthy manners of this bird as he met with an instance of a pair breeding in the privy of an uninhabited house in the suburbs of  Tzaritzn  Arct Zool    "I am informed by colonel  Davies  that they every year are seen in  Gibraltar  in  March  in small flocks of ten or twelve hence are  called there  March Cocks  They are supposed to come from  Africa  and to be on their passage north to some other place as they only stay a few hours to rest themselves and it is not uncommon to see five or six flocks in a week during the time of their passage He did not ob∣serve them to have any note but that they had a dipping kind of flight not unlike a  Woodpecker  I have observed this Bird to be among paintings both from  China  and  India  it is therefore no doubt com∣mon to both those parts"  Lath

Messenger Bird from the resemblance its crest has to the plumes worn by the  Chaous  or  Turkish  couriers  Latham says the  female  is like the  male  and lays from two to seven eggs but for the most part four or five These are somewhat less than those of a Partridge but longer and ashcoloured This Bird is said to have two or three broods in a year and to lay the eggs in the holes of trees like the  Woodpecker  but in general to make no nest notwithstanding which  Buffon  observed that two out of six nests which were brought to him for inspection had a soft lining of moss wool leaves feathers and the like and he is of opinion that when this is the case the bird has made use of the old nest of some other bird It will also lay and hatch the young in holes of walls and even on the ground The food of this bird is insects and it is the exuviae of the large beetles and such like with which the nest is crouded that cause the nest to stink so horribly insomuch that former writers asserted the nest to be made of excrement  In  Sepp  's plate the nest is placed in the hollow of a tree it is composed of soft bents and smooth within The eggs four in number of a blueish white marked with pale brown spots  Buffon  mentions one of this species which lived with a lady for three months subsisting only on bread and cheese and contrary to the common opinion drank frequently and that by gulps Another was kept for eighteen months on raw meat and would not eat any thing else  Olina  says that this bird lives three years  In some countries it is esteemed as good eating It seldom perches on trees unless they are very low It does not erect its crest except when agitated by surprize in a natural state the crest falling behind the neck    but whenever it alights on the ground it is said to spread its crest beautifully  Some authors mention a variety of this species  Kolben  K  l  en Hist du Cap I p    mentions one at the  Cape of Good Hope  which is smaller the bill shorter in proportion and the legs longer the crest is not so long and has no trace of white in it throughout and in general the plumage is less variegated Another specimen from the same place had the upper

Latham's shot a pair of those birds on  Bexley Heath  near  Dartford  in  Kent April  the th as they were sitting on a furze bush they fed on flies springing from the bush every time one approached near and returning to the same place repeatedly thereby imitating as he observes the manners of our  Cinereous Flycatcher  This species resides with us in the winter Several specimens which are now

an intelligent observer of  English  Birds  Mr Green  has informed him that he never met with this species in the neighbourhood of  London  except in  winter  and that it disappears be∣fore the end of

rather suppose that if it does not quit  England  in summer it will hereafter be found in the northern parts of it  PLATE XI AMPELIS GARRULUS WAXEN CHATTERER PASSERES  Bill conic pointed Nostrils oval

slightest appearance of spots except on the breast and back which may be of a deep black intermingled with a few white feathers and glossed with shining purple others we find that have the ruffs of a deep brown barred with black some with white ruffs spotted with brown or brown spotted with white and indeed with every variation that it is possible to describe  The  females  or  Reeves  Pennant asserts never change their colours which he says are pale brown the back spotted with black slightly edged with white the tail brown the middle feathers spotted with black the breast and belly white the legs of a pale dull yellow but I have two specimens that do not well agree with his description or correspond with each other and in the Leverian museum a variety of that sex is preserved that is wholly white except the wings on which the usual markings are visible in a very pale colour  The female has no ruff and the male does not attain that appendage until the second season at the time of incubation the plumage of the latter is in the full perfection and the pimples break out on his face but after that time they shrink beneath the skin the long feathers of the ruff fall off and he again assumes the plain appearance of the female  These Birds inhabit the North of  Europe  in summer as far as Ice∣land as well as the northern marshes of  Russia  and  Siberia  In this country they are found in  Lincolnshire  the Isle of  Ely  and in the east  riding of  Yorkshire  Brit Zool  they arrive at those places early in the spring and disappear about  Michaelmas  The Reeve lays four eggs in a tuft of grass the beginning of May they are white marked with large rusty spots  Soon after their arrival the males begin to  hill  that is to collect on some dry bank near a splash of water in expectation of the females Each male keeps possession of a small piece of ground round which it runs so often as to form a bare circular path the instant a female alights among them the males are in motion a general battle ensues and the fowlers who have been waiting for the advantage of such an event catch them in their nets in great numbers  They visit a place called  Martinmere  in  Lancashire  the latter end of March or beginning of April but do not continue there above three weeks  Brit Zool    In the fens each male remains within his circle and defends himself against every invader with much resolution the least infringement on his possession by another male is resented with the greatest violence and if any farther attack is made a battle is the consequence in fighting they have the same action as a cock spread their ruffs and place their bills to the ground  "It is usual to sat these birds for table by means of  bread  and  milk  mixed with  hempseed  and sometimes boiled  wheat  to these by many  sugar  is added which last in a fortnight's time will cause them to be one lump of fat when they will fetch from two shillings to half a crown each"  Lath Gen Syn

other it is ex∣tremely rare  It is unnecessary for us to describe the many varieties that are known of this species in England the colours of its plumage varies consi∣derably at different seasons of the year but such as are natives of fo∣reign countries are again so dissimilar to ours that different authors have alternately described them as varieties or new species  The bird that  Latham  describes was white on the outer web of the exterior tail feather the two exterior tail feathers of  Willoughby  's bird was marked with white and on the contrary we have a speci∣men which does not exhibit the least trace of white on either The upper tail coverts are black and white mixed in some specimens in others they are wholly black and  Le Gobemouche noir  of  Brisson  which is only another variety differs in having a mixture of grey on  the upper parts the thighs brown and white and  three  of the exte∣rior tail feathers white on the margins  A more pleasing variety than either is found in  Lorraine  and  Brie  it corresponds in size with those found in England but the white of the breast which terminates under the cheeks in the latter passes quite round the neck like a collar in the former  This variety is called by Buffon  Le Gobemouche noir à Collier  Hist des Ois p pl f    The plumage of the female is brown in those parts where the male is black it has no white on the forehead the white spot on the wing is more obscure and the under parts of the body is of a dusky white The male possesses only the full black during the summer as that season declines its plumage alters and it gradually assumes so per∣fectly the appearance of the female that he cannot be distinguished from her  The nest is usually built in the hole of a tree not very near the ground it is composed of fibres mixed with moss and contains six eggs It feeds on Insects  PLATE XXIII STERNA HIRUNDO COMMON TERN ANSERES  Bill obtuse covered with a thin membrane broad gibbous below the base

vol appears also to be a variety the legs are black and the bill is of the same colour except the tip which is red  These Birds breed among tufts of rushes grass or moss near the water side they lay three or four eggs about an inch and three quarters in length of a dull olive colour marked with irregular black spots and sprinkled with specks of an obscure brown in June the young birds are hatched in July and quit the nest soon after  They feed on small fish and water insects are very clamorous and daring and during the time of incubation will dart on any person who may pass by their nest though they should neither provoke nor disturb them  It appears to have all the actions over the water which the Swallow has on land skimming and describing vast circuits over the surface of the waves when seeking its prey diving with intrepidity the instant it discovers it and instantly appearing again on the wing with the fish in its mouth Notwithstanding the affinity of its actions with those of the Swallow  Pennant  in the British Zoology has altered the name to  Tern  "a name" he observes in a note "these birds are known by in the  North of England  and which we substitute instead of the old compound one of  SeaSwallow  which was given them on account of their forked tails"  PLATE XXIV STURNUS CINCLUS WATEROUZEL PASSERES  Bill conic pointed Nostrils oval broad naked  GENERIC CHARACTER

covering of green moss and contains five eggs of a white colour with a blush of red In young birds the belly is wholly white  Most authors have noticed the very singular manner in which it searches
