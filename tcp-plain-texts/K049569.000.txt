 A NEW THEORY OF  Continual FEVERS  WHEREIN Besides the Appearances of such  Fevers  and the method of their Cure occasionally the structure of the  Glands  and the manner of Secretion the Operation of  Purgative    Vomitive  and  Mercurial  Medicines are Mechanically explain'd  Si propius stes  Te capiet magis  Horat de Arte Poet  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  H Newman  at the  Grashopper  in the  Poultrey  and  J Nutt  near  StationersHall    THE PREFACE  TO write any thing tolerable about  Fevers  or any thing worse than what has already been advanced by some one or other on the Head is perhaps no easie matter The ridiculous manner of accounting for their Causes and Symptoms used by some Pretenders to  Medicine  and  Philosophy  has perhaps contributed in its way to that contempt to which with such Expence of  Satyr  and  Wit  they and their Art have been expos'd  I have not the Arrogance to think the few following Sheets will conduce  any thing to wipe it off But of this I'm sure if this  Theory  prove False the choices behind are fewer by one of the true Kind which endeavours to account from their Appearances from  Mechanick  Principles  The Wiser part of Mankind are now perswaded That this Machine we carry about is nothing but an Infinity of Branching and Winding Canals fill'd with Liquors of different Natures and I am mightily out in my Conjunctures if for the Future any be heard about  Theories  of  Diseases  or the manner of the Operation of Medicines who do not reason from these  Data  and their necessary Consequences And seeing  Continual Fevers  are only a Complication of Symptoms which naturally follow upon a general Obstruction of these Canals or the  Glands  which they constitute and the necessary Effects thereof as I reckon None  I hope will be angry I have call'd such a manner of Accounting for them  New  seeing for any thing I know as to the main thereof it is really so  For the structure of the  Glands  and the business of  Secretion  the Foundation is  Bellini  's but I hope it has lost nothing in my hands I have added somethings extended others and made all plain and consequential  As to the other things here occasionally explain'd which adding what  Bellini  had advanc'd about  BloodLetting  make up the great and principal Operations perform'd by Medicines on Animal Bodies I have very frankly borrow'd what of them I found for my purpose from  Borelli  the foresaid  Bellini  and another Gentleman whom I reckon the Ornament of his Profession and Our Countrey But for the most part pointing at Place and Person And I shall  reckon my self no more a  Plagiary  for this than a Lawyer is to be accounted one for quoting his  Code  or  Pandects  The occasion of entering upon those thoughts was the noise and bustle has been made among us about  Vomiting in Fevers  about a Year ago I Endeavour'd to satisfie my self so as you may see and had the Vanity to think there might be some as great Fools as I If I be mistaken it's not the first time  I have not been over nice in ranging the Particulars here contain'd those who read the whole will see their dependance and for others I was not at the pains to lay in  The Language is that which most easily dropt from my Pen at first writing the Roughness of some terms of Art I cou'd not avoid and the purity of the  English  Tongue is neither the growth of our Country nor of my  occasions if it be intelligible it is all and perhaps some may say more than I design'd  I neither expect nor desire any reputation from these Papers for I sufficiently know how few such things oblige Besides I'm dreadfully affraid few will Read them and not over many understand them for want of the necessary Qualifications of a moderate attention and a smattering of the Mathematicks The first is absolutely necessary but for the latter they may even have a strong Faith tho both for them and my self I cou'd wish it were joyn'd with Knowledge  As for Censure I am in no great dread of it For I shall lye Secure because conceal'd and see its adversaries if it have the honour to provoke any shoot at rovers If any shall take the pains to confute what I have here advanc'd he may do it very safely for his humble Servant If he bungle it  he'll do me an honour by shewing it is not such as every Body is able to disprove If he do it to purpose he'll do me a kindness by freeing me from my errors I design for the future to meddle no more with it than if it had dropt from the Clouds  In fine all my present concern is for the Bookseller If he ben't a loser which misfortune wou'd be the most effectual confutation it is indifferent to me whether it perish by a particular or the general conflagration  A NEW THEORY OF  Continual FEVERS  POSTULATA  THAT the whole Body is nothing but a Congeries of Canals the greatest at least a considerable part of which is  Glands  properly so called design'd for the separation of some Fluid  This is evident when any part of the Body is Swell'd so that the inconspicuous ones become Visible  and has been clearly demonstrated by  Malpigius    Leuvenhoeck  and oothers  That when a Machine is disordered if we should see it righted by adjusting such a particular Part we might without scruple affirm that it was some injury done to that part which had disorder'd the Machine especially if after the whole was taken to Pieces we should find them all sound save that particular one  Thus if we should see a Watchmaker by adjusting only the Ballance of a Watch make her go right we might say the distortion of the Axe thereof had occasion'd her going wrong especially if all the other parts be found as they should be  LEMMA  LEt there be a greater Distractile Cylindrical Canal whose  Orifice is ABCD through which a giv'n quantity of Liquor passes in a giv'n time and a lesser one EFGH  through which a proportionable Quantity of the same Liquor passes with the same Celerity as in the former Let now the greater ABCD be encreas'd or diminish'd by the lesser EFGH So as that in the encreas'd or diminish'd Cylindrical Canals the same Quantities only pass which pass'd in the same time in the first supposed Canal  ABCD To find the quantity of the same Fluid which will distract and produce the other effects of encreasing the quantity of the passing Fluid and consequently its Celerity the Canal by encreasing it's Diameter first suppos'd ABCD after the same manner only that the encreas'd ABCD+EFGH or diminish'd ABCDEFGH Canals are now distracted  Let the Quantity which in the first Supposition passes through the Canal ABCD be call'd  a  and the Quantity which passes through the Canal EFGH be call'd  b  ▪ Since in the first supposition the celerities are the same in both their Orifices will be as  a  and  b  respectively Likewise the encreas'd and diminish'd Canals seeing their Altitude is suppos'd the same will be as their Orifices  a  +  b  and  ab  and the Quantities passing through  them in the same time with the same celerity would be likewise as  a  +  b  and  a    b  But in the second Supposition the same quantity is suppos'd to pass in the encreas'd Canal  a  +  b  and diminish'd one  a  b  which pass  d in the first suppos'd Canal ABC  or  therefore now the quantities passing through the Canals encreased or diminished will be as  a  wherefore as  a  +  b  the Quantity passing through the encreas'd or diminish'd Canals in the first supposition is to  a  the quantity passing through them in the second supposition so is  b  the quantity passing through the lesser Canal EFGH in the first supposition to  the Proportional Quantity which passes through and will distract the lesser Canal EFGH after the same manner that the encreas'd  or diminish'd Canals are distracted in the second Position Adding or Substracting this quantity from  a  which is as the quantity passing through or distracting the encreas'd or diminish'd Canals the Sum or difference  will be as the quantity which will distract the First suppos'd Canal ABCD after the same manner  c q e i  SCHOLIUM  THe whole Canals of the Body save the Intestines and Lacteals may be considered as a concave Cylinder whose Base is the Orifice of the Aorta at its exit from the heart and whose length is a mean Arithmetick Proportional betwixt the longest and shortest Artery I mean the whole length of the Artery till  it degenerat into a Vein for the length of the Veins are of no consideration here It being their splitting into Branches which makes them not Cylindrical Now by  Postul  the Vessels which make up the  Glands  may have any proportion of minority to the whole of the Canals Supposing then an Obstruction or dilatation of the  Glandular  Vessels it's evident the foresaid concave Cylinder will be thereby diminish'd or encreasd in any given Proportion Suppose  e g  the diameter of the Cylinder so Obstructed is to that of the whole as  is to the  their Orifices will be as to Suppose again there are twenty pounds of Blood in a Man seeing at the Beginning of the Arterial Vessels which constitute the Glands the Velocity is near the same as proceeding from  the same cause the compression of the Heart Therfore divide into two parts which may be in this case as is to which done by this general rule  x  =    y  =  puting  d  for the pounds  x  for the greater and  y  for the lesser proportional Part  m  to  n  their  Ratio  The Parts will be here ⅔ and ⅓ which are the proportional parts of pounds of Blood which would naturaly pass in the obstructCanal and in the Remainder thereof which is passable But if all the pounds must now pass in the passable Canals then it shall be distracted as much as if the whole Canals were passable but that pounds of Blood were forced through it in the same time by the preceding Lemma For  in this case  a  =  b  =⅔  a    l  =⅓ and therefore  = If the Orifices were as to then  b  =  a  b  = and  =⅓ this supposing an Obstruction If there be a dilatation suppos'd in the same Proportions then  will be in the first case in the second The same may be applyed to the  Liquidum Nervorum  which passes in the Nervous Canals For the  Gland  consists of a complicated  Nerve  as well as  Arterie  and in an obstruction or dilatation of the same both  Arterie  and  Nerve  are suppos'd to be obstructed or dilated  The design of all this is to show that in an Obstruction or Dilatation of the Vessels it is the same thing as if the Liquors therein  contained were augmented or diminish'd in a certain Proportion as in the case of the Bloodvessels Supposing pounds of Blood which is the ordinary Quantity in a Man and Supposing one half of the whole by an Obstruction in any place of the said Vessels were rendred impassable it is the same thing  quam proxime  as if the whole Blood Vessels were Passable but that one half more of Blood were forced through them in the same time in which the pounds passed Of the same nature is  LEMMA  THe Blood being so corrupted that the strength is impair'd or encreas'd it is the same thing as if it were in its natural estate but that the quantity thereof were diminish'd or encreas'd in such a  Proportion as is necessary for producing this encrease or decrease of strength  This is  th  Prop of  Bellini  's Book  de Motu Cordis  c and its Converse The Proposition it self is there demonstrated and its Converse may be demonstrated after the same manner exactly  What is here said of encreasing or diminishing the strength is likewise true of all the necessary effects of lessening or encreasing the quantity of the Blood These things premis'd I come to  THE General Proposition  THE General and most effectual cause of all Fevers is the Obstruction or Dilatation of the  complicated  Nerve  and  Arterie    the excretory Duct conservatory  one or rather all these which as shall be afterward shewn make up the  Glands  and they receive their denomination as these or those  Glands  are more or less Obstructed or Dilated  Other things may concur but these are the most powerfull causes  It were a work of more time and pains than I can at present bestow to apply this Proposition to all particular kinds of  Fevers  tho' I am sufficiently satisfied it will account for All I shall here only as an earnest of the rest show how to apply it to continual  Fevers  and therefore contract the General into  The Particular Proposition  THE most effectual Cause of continual  Fevers  is an obstrution of the  Glands  which will necessarily augment the Quantity of the Blood and  Liquidum Nervorum  in the passable Canals and perhaps by the Stagnation of the Fluids contain'd in these so vitiate their nature as that they may be reckoned to concur as a partial cause of these  Fevers  But I rely most on the First to wit the augmentation of these Fluids For a Demonstration of this I shall First shew how it accounts for all the appearances of such  Fevers  and then subjoyn several Arguments to confirm the same  Supposing the  Glands  Obstructed the Quantity of the Blood in the  Arteries  and the  Liquidum Nervorum  in the  Nerves  may thereby be suppos'd augmented in any given proportion of minority to the whole mass of these Liquors  per Lemma  and its  Scholium  Wherefore it will hence follow  § That the Pulses must be stronger and more frequent than ordinary upon these accounts  Seeing there is a greater Quantity than ordinary of Blood in the  Arteries  the Lateral Pression will be stronger and seeing the  Arteries  are distractile they will be driven outward with greater force and make a stronger  Ictus  upon any thing apply'd to them Seeing the Quantity of the Blood is augmented  i e  the Quantity of the matter whence the  Liquidum  Nervorum  is generated there must be a greater plenty thereof  per poster part Lemm  generated and consequently it will flow more plentifully and more quickly into the heart and make it contract oftner and more violently By the obstruction of the  Gland  the influence of the  Liquidum Nervorum  thereinto is likewise obstructed and therefore  per Lemm  there will be a greater Quantity thereof left to flow in the passable  Nerves  and it must flow  qua data porta  Lastly the  Arteries  on every siderunning upon and touching the  Medullar  substance and  Fibre  of the Brain will they being more than ordinarily distended press them more than ordinarily and make a more powerful and plentiful derivation of the  Liquidum Nervorum  into the places whither it can flow  § From the same cause the inequality or Interruption of the Puises is evident For if the foresaid Pressions upon the  Nervous Fibres  of the  Brain  be so strong that it either partly or  totally  occludes the passage of the  Liquidum Nervorum  there must be a stop in the derivation till there be such a Quantity thereof collected as shall be sufficient to overpower the  Impedimentum  occasion'd by this Pression and so make an inequality or stop in the contraction of the Heart Moreover when the Blood flows in such plenty and with such violence from the  Auricles  into the  Ventricles  of the Heart it may force it's way before the  Ventricle  be intirely Contracted and thereby cause an irregularity in the Pulse Add to these what may proceed from the thickness of the Blood it being contracted into a  less space and evaporation of its Humidity All these either singly or compounded will account for the irregularities of the Pulses which have hitherto been observed  § Great pains in the Head must ensue from the violent Distractions of the tender Vessels of the  Brain  and from the great pressure of the extended  Arteries  upon the  Fibres  and  Membranes  thereof all the Canals of every kind being Bowld'ned with their Respective Liquors and that being the most sensible place  § A violent and Burning Heat must be felt upon these accounts Because there is a greater quantity than ordinary running in the passable Canals there must be a greater Motion than ordinary and consequently a greater heat Meerly upon the account of the encreased Quantity without considering  the thereby produc'd greater Velocity there must be felt a greater Heat For supposing the Heat in each single particle to be the same as before Yet since the particles are more numerous in the same Place the heat must be greater there too As in Rays contracted by a  Concave speculum  The  Glands  being obstructed  i e  the passages of perspiration the natural Heat must thereby be kept in and consequently the whole augmented  per Lemm  Hence proceeds our unquenchable Thirst the Humidity  i e  the thinnest parts being more ready to evaporate since now the ordinary passages are obstructed the rest must be proportionally dryer  § The difficulty and frequency of Respiration and the violence of expiration is hence easily accounted for The quantity  of Blood being augmented there must a proportional greater quantity thereof be deriv'd into the  Arteries  of the Lungs and since every one of the little Vesicles of the  Bronchi  lye betwixt two  Arteries  thus inflated it will be harder to explicate these Vesicles and therefore one in such a state will naturally with all his force endeavour to suck in the Air which will be forc'd out again both by these inflated  Arteries  and by the force of the  Muscles  of the  Breast    Diaphragm  and  Lungs  which is vastly augmented both by the greater quantity of Blood and of the  Liquidum Nervorum  and its more plentiful derivation as has been shown in § About the frequency and strength of the Pulses  § The Tongue is rough and discolour'd because by the violent motion of the Blood and the Obstruction  of the common passages the humidity is evaporated and the extraordinary Heat stiffens the  Fibres  thereof For it is evident that only heat and dryness discolour the Tongue  Vide  §  § Want of Sleep must follow both Because there is such plenty of Blood and consequently of the  Liquidum Nervorum  as is shown § that there is no need of Sleep to generate more which is one principal use thereof and because of diverse disorders of the Head accounted for § which will not allow that tranquility which is necessary to bring it on but most of all because by the plenty of the  Liquidum Nervorum  all the  Muscles  both involuntary and voluntary especially those who want  Antagonists  are in continual violent motions which must necessarily hinder Sleep  § Ravings proceed from the disorders in the Head accounted for § The  Nerves  being distracted by the abundance of their Liquor the Heat and dryness of their parts cannot perform these reciprocations which are necessary in sound persons  § The clear and Flamecolour'd Urine proceeds from the velocity of the Blood which seperates thereby only the thinest of the mixt Fluid as shall be shown when we come to speak about Secretion  § The vast encrease of strength in persons labouring under high Fevers is evident from  Lemm    § Lastly the ceasing and dissolution of Fevers by Purging Sweating Vomiting and Abscesses is wonderfully accounted for from this  Theory  For if they go off by  the strength of Nature then seeing the greater Quantity and Velocity of the Blood produce a greater  Momentum  by the frequent concussions and force of this the Obstructions are shatter'd and wash'd away till the last strokes carry away all together and thereby go off in these or those according as these or those  Glands  were most obstructed This will be better understood when we come to speak of  Mercurial Med'cines  If by the assistance of Med'cines then the Med'cines must be such as are most proper for removing these obstructions as shall be afterwards shown  Thus I think I have accounted for all the appearances of  Continual Fevers  which I reckon one considerable argument for our  Theory  All we see done in the dissolution or ceasing of such  Fevers  is the opening the  Glands  the driving out the stagnated Fluids therein contained which  per postul  is another argument And indeed one would hardly keep himself from thinking that if the removing these obstructions remov'd the disease then the putting them caus'd it  quo posito ponitur    quo sublato tollitur  All that is observable upon opening persons cut off by  Fevers  is the rest being sound and intire an extraordinary Swelling and Lividity in the internal  Glands  Particularly of the  Lungs  the  Liver  the  Spleen  and the  Mesentery  as has been observ'd by  Borelli  and others  Vide Borelli de Motu Animal  Part prop This is one ocular  demonstration  of our  Theory  and if the other  Glands  were as conspicuous I doubt not we should see the same in them  A fourth Argument for our  Theory  is from what Dr  Pitoairne  has demonstrated in his  Treatise  of the  Cure  of  Fevers  For since in  Fevers  the  Glands  are obstructed  i e  the conduits of insensible Perspiration then by removing this obstruction  i e  by encreasing the insensible Perspiration  Fevers  will be more probably cured than by encreasing all the sensible evacuations And that in the proportion the number of the  Glands  of the whole Body has to the number of the  Glands  of the  primae viae  or as the whole outward and inward  surfaces  have to the  surfaces  of the  primae viae proxime  A fifth argument is from what  Bellini  has demonstrated in his third and last Prop in his  Section    De Febribus  He there shews  continu'd  Fevers  may arise from a Vitiation in the Quantity Quality or Motion of the Blood from all or either of these Moreover from an encrease or diminution of the quantity of the Blood there will necessarly arise an augmentation or diminution of its velocity The motion depends upon the Quantity multiply'd iuto the Velocity and the Quality arises for the most part from a Combination or the necessary effects of these Hence you see all that necessarily follows upon the whole three may be accounted for from the first of these to wit the encreass or diminution of the quantity of the Blood  Amputations Wounds Fractures and the like wonderfully confirm this Doctrine For there a considerable number of the Bloodvessels are stopt and cannot make  their Circle and consequently encrease the quantity of Blood in the rest So that generaly  Fevers  ensue if the quantity be not lessen'd by letting It is true the violent Pain may concur since all Pain is a  Stimulus  and all  Stimulations  occasion a more plentifull derivation of the  Liquidum Nervorum  But if the quantity of Blood be not suppos'd to be augmented that liquor must necessarily fail in a short time  We may see visibly in  Fevers  from Cold there is a violent Obstruction of the  Glands  of the  Skin  the  Mouth    Larynx    Stomach  In a word of all these  Glands  to which the Cold Air is contiguous and we can tell whence this Obstruction proceeds Besides this  Fever  may be encreas'd to such a degree as to differ little in its symptoms violence or duration from other more dangerous continual  Fevers  which is a  clear demonstration of our Doctrine For since an evident Obstruction of the  Glands  produces  Fevers  so very like the most dangerous ones why may we not conclude that some latent and unknown cause may produce so general and strong an Obstruction as is able to occasion all the several more dangerous  Fevers  of this kind  But that which I take to be alone without any other Proofs a demonstration of our  Theory  is That in all Conntrys betwixt the  Tropicks  their Continual or Hot  Fevers  arise from a severe Cold Wind suddenly blowing after excessive Gleams of Heat This is so true that all Travellers assign this as the cause having constantly observ'd their  Fevers  to succeed such sudden changes of the Air A pregnant Instance of which we have in  Phil Trans  For  Decem  N  In a Letter from Mr  Hugh Jones  to Dr  Woodroof  concerning some observables in  MaryLand  His words are these  The NorthWest Wind is very sharp in Winter and even in the Heat of Summer it mightily cools the Air and too often at that time a Sudden NorthWestern Wind strikes our labourers into a  Fever  when they are not caresul to provide for it and put on their Garments while they are at work  Thus he And indeed the genuin account of the matter is this The excessive heat must necessarily dilate the  Glands  to which it is contiguous  i e  all the  Cutaneous Glands  the  Glands  of the  Trachea    Bronchi    Osophragus    Stomach  and of the  Intetines  and it will not only Dilate them but by the assistance of the natural action of these which is Secretion Exhale their respective  Liquors making them still flow so long as the excessive Heat continues and as there is Blood which may supply them Now they being thus dilated and by the  Efflux  of their Liquors soft'ned and made spungy a sudden excessive Cold supervening must strongly contract their Orifices and congeal their  owing Liquors and the greatness of their contraction will be always in proportion to the violence of the former Heat and supervening Cold conjunctly as is known from the nature of Cold And this Contraction of their Orifices and Congelation of their Fluids will obstruct the motion of the Blood almost up to the Heart at least to the next division of the  Artery  which constitutes this  Gland  whereby both the Blood will be encreas'd as to its Quantity and perhaps by this stagnation of a part of the same  as to the Quality thereof likewise All which is but a  Corollary  of our  Theory  Hence we evidently see the reason of the frequency of our last Years Fevers For we were then exactly in proportion to our Climats in the state of those betwixt the  Tropicks  Our SummerDay heats were more violent than had been observ'd among us in the Memory of men and our nights had no ways the Heat proportionate to our days Besides we had often sudden changes which tho' not so Violent as in these warmer Countreys Yet had the same tho' a slower effect as among them And therefore it was that frequent Vomitings were found so usefull which at least in such a degree as was found then necessary is not always so safe The Practice was entirely agreeable to that of these Southern  Countreys and the necessity thereof will be understood when we come to speak of  Vomiting  The same practise obtains in Fevers occasion'd by surfeiting or Drunkenness which is still to be suspected as a considerable part of the cause of Fevers in adult Persons in great Cities  And generally I should think either the above mention'd sudden changes which may happen a Thousand other ways different from the Season or a direct continu'd fit of violent Cold or excesses in Eating or Drinking one or all of these have a large share in most of our Continal Fevers  Lastly it is no ways accountable from any other  Theory  as I think how these Liquors which are secreted from the  Glands  at the Dissolution of Fevers could be so different from the  ordinary fluids which are there excern'd From ours it is evident for an Obstruction of the  Glands  must necessarily make their respective Liquors to stagnate which will many ways alter their nature But from any other  Hypothesis  I do not see how this can come to pass which will lead me to consider one or two of the commonest Opinions about continual  Fevers  The most common and generally obtaining Opinion about Fevers is that they are more immediately produc'd by some  Morbifick  matter like a Poison which mixing and circulating with the mass of the Blood Produces all those frightful Symtoms which we feel This Opinion is sufficiently confuted  Prop    dae part  of  Borelli  's Book  De mot Animal  whither I refer the reader only adding to what he has there  adduced this one Argument  When any Corrupt Matter is mix'd with the Blood so as to vitiate the whole mass as Vinegar among Water the way of Curing such a vitiation is either by forming new  Glands  to derive the vitious part of the mixture or by draining the whole mixture good and bad and Substituting new pure Blood in it's place Or lastly by disposing the already form'd  Glands  to secern the corrupted part  The first of these is ridiculous  Some thing like the second is done when the Blood is really vitiate in the whole as inveterate Poxes but that cure cannot here have a place as shall be afterwards shewn  As to the third way let us consider  How hard it is to think when the whole Mass is suppos'd corrupted that the vitious part all at once or in the space of a few Hours in which time we know after a  Crise  Fevers commonly leave People should be intirely evacuated This is not like the actions of Nature which works leisurely and by degrees  Let us consider whence all the  Glands  at least the greater part of them should be so alter'd seeing their configurations are so different and naturally they secern so different Liquors as all at one time to separate the same  Morbifick  matter And  How at the  Crise  only and at no other time they should be so dispos'd  It will be very hard in any other  Theory  in this more particularly save ours to account for these  things without recurring to miracles or the absurd  Metaphorick  Terms of Sympathy Antipathy and the like These then with what  Borelli  has brought against this Opinion in the forecited places are abundantly sufficient to show the ridiculousness thereof  But there are several Physicians who observing that in Fevers there was by a Vomit a tough viscid matter thrown out of the stomach have thought this matter generated there and mixing with the Mass of the Blood might be a considerable Part of the cause of  Fevers  at least might considerably augment the same and have from thence brought Arguments for the necessity of Vomiting in Fevers  This Opinion supposes these things  That the Quantity of the  Morbifick  matter excern'd by a  Vomit before the Administration thereof was existent in the cavity of the Stomach after the same manner that other things are which are deriv'd into the Mass of the Blood else it could never get thither This I shall consider when I come to speak of the Operation and effects of Vomiting  That it is at least possible this  Morbifick  matter may be deriv'd into the Mass of Blood let us at present consider this  I know no way any thing of any tolerable consistence can get into the Mass of the Blood but by the  Lacteal Veins  It is true from the sudden effects of some Spirits Medicines and strong Meats we are certain that the more refin'd parts of these may get into the  Brain  without going the tedious Circle of the  Lacteals  But this is done by the Reciprocal  motion of the  Nerves  the necessity and Mechanical Operation of which  Borelli  has demonstrated  prop    dae part De motu Animalium  However I think none will pretend such a course for this viscuous  Morbifick  matter And therefore if it gets into the Mass of the Blood it must go the common road of the  Lacteals  To decide the matter I must suppose my Reader to have consider'd the last  prop    Ex ijs quae ad separationes  which  Beilini  has in his  Preface  to his Book  De Ʋrinis Pulsibus  c and the and of his last Book  De Motu Cordis  c where the construction of the  Glands  and the manner of separations are demonstratively unfolded which I take to be the noblest discovery in these matters of this age From these places it is clear that  Prop  A  Gland  is nothing but a great many complications and circumvolutions of the  Artery  all over the coats of which little branchings of  Nerves  pass design'd principally for the Spiral Contortion thereof that the Blood may be the more easily propogated through the same But this is common to all the  Arteries  and  Veins  whereby without any Interruption of the same spire the propagation of the Blood in the former from the heart to the extremities of the Body and from the extremities to the heart back again in the latter is assisted which sends out from the sides thereof little Secretory Canals which terminate in one common conduit and is call'd the  Emissary  of the  Gland  or perhaps in a common  Pelvis  as in the  Kidneys  and the same  Artery  after these windings degenerates into a  Vein  Prop  That separation or secretion is perform'd by the composition of two motions in the Fluid one propagated through the length of the Canal another transversly through its sides for it is demonstrable that all Fluids press  undiqua{que}  and that the direction of their pression is perpendicular in every point to the sides of the containing vessel The composition of which two is the motion or rather direction of the separated Fluid  Prop  That in a mixt Fluid consisting of greater and lesser cohesion of parts of greater and lesser Fluidity That which has the least cohesion and greatest Fluidity is first separated  i e  is separated in the  Glands  whose compounding  Artery  is shortest or at least distance from the heart or Fountain of Motion And these of the next cohesion and next greatest  Fluidity is next separated and so on The distances from the Heart being in a compounded proportion of these  Prop  That the  Intestines  are really such a  Gland  and the most visible one in the Body whose secretory Vessels are the  Lacteals  and whose common conservatory or  Pelvis  is the  Recepaculum Chyli  To these I shall add because of its affinity the following  Prop  The quantity separated in every  Gland  is in a compounded proportion of the celerity of the Fluid at the respective Orifices And of the Orifices themselves of the separating Canals  I shall here subjoyn the Demonstration of this Proposition referring that of the rest to their Author  DEMONSTRATION  THE Orifices being given the quantity separated is as the celerities of the Fluid For in a greater celerity there is a greater quantity separated in a less celerity a lesser quantity The Celerities being giv'n the quantity separated is as the Orifices directly for at a great Orifice there is greater quantity separated at a less Orifice a lesser quantity And therefore neither being giv'n the quantity separated is as the celerities and the Orifices conjuctly  q e d  From all these I draw the following  COROLLARIA  THe separated Fluids differ only in their degrees of Cohesion and Fluidity  per Prop    The reason why Fluids of different degrees of Cohesion and Fluidity are separated in such and such  Glands  is the different degrees of the Velocity of the Fluid at the respective Orifices of the separating Vessels and the differences of the Orifices themselves  per prop    The  Glands  themselves differ only in the length of the  Artery  the difference and number of its Complications and Convolutions  per prop    Each  Gland  naturally and equally working separates only the Fluid proper to it self  i e  peculiar to such lengths and complications of such degrees of Fluidity or Cohesion to such bigness or smallness of the Orifices of the separating Canals  per Prop  and But this last is of small consideration  That Secretion may be perform'd the most easily that may be the insertion of the separating Canal ought to be at an  Angle  of degrees with the  Artery    per prop  For let AB Represent the  Artery  if it make a Right line or its  Tangent  if it make a Curve and let the motion of the Fluid be from A to B the right line AB  will likewise represent its direction propogated from the Heart Erect at A the perpendicular AC this will represent the direction of the lateral pression of the Fluid Compleat the Parallelogram ABCD  The direction of the composition of these two motions will be the Diagonal AD as is known which in the present case makes an Angle of degrees with the  Artery  AB This were well worth the observing if it be possible in Animals but it must be in live ones before their parts have alter'd their Positions And here it were worth the examing likewise whither what Mr  Newton  has demonstrated  Scol prop    lib    Princip Phil Mathem  about the resistance of  Conical  Figures obtains in Animal Bodys For tho his demonstration be only concerning  Convex Cones  yet the same obtains in  Concave  ones wherefore seeing the  Artery  betwixt any two  Branchings  is a  Conus Truncatus  it may be represented by the figure  CEBGF  Now seeing the Diameter CB of the base of this  Conus truncatus  and the Diameter  FG  of the Base  FDG  of the  Conus abscissus FDGS  as likewise their Distance O D may all be had it is evident that the intire  Cone  CBGSH may be had likewise Wherefore Bisect the distance OD in Q and if it be found having drawn CQ that QS is equal to QC then the  Conus Truncatus  CE BGF among all of the same Base and Altitude gives the least resistance to the Blood flowing from O to D  I am enclin'd to think this may obtain in the truncks  of the great  Arteries    branchings for no further  considered This I recommend to be examin'd for the honour of that great Man who has crouded up in this  Scholium  not to mention the rest of his admirable Book a vast number if retail'd of most Charming and useful Truths  To come now to the Business The  Testiculi Humani  are granted by every one to be  Glands  and  Bellini  has found the length of the complicated  Artery  in one of them to be Ells and the Altitude of one of these  Glands  when freed of its integuments to be Ell Whence I conclude there must be Plications or Circumvolutions in one of these  Proxime  He likewise asserts That  caeteris paribus  if two Fluids of the same Nature with equal Velocities  the one be forc'd into a Canal of the same Number and Lengths of Complications as are in the foresaid  Gland  and the other into a streight Canal of the same length The Velocity in or about their  Exits  of the first Fluid to that of the second will be as to He has not indeed subjoyn'd the Demonstration But if we suppose the  Artery  to lye in  Plicae  or solds of such number and lengths as we have just now determin'd which is perhaps not far from truth and if we suppose the Turnings of the  Plicae  to be circular which perhaps may follow from this That seeing a Circle is the only ordinate figure of an infinite number of equal Sides and equal Angles it must be the only  Curve  which can make in all its parts the Angle of  Incidence  equal to the Angle of  Reflection  and  consequently the only  Curve  in which a Fluid would most easily turn and likewise the Arch in which they turn to be a Semicircle which it must be if the sides run Parallel after the turning and Universally if the sides produc  d make any Angle from the quantity thereof the quantity of the Arch in which they turn may be determined I say from these  Data  the former Proportion may be by Calculation examined or perhaps more briefly by Experiment thus  Take a Pipe of Metal of any Diameter and  old it into any determin'd number of  Plicae  whose sides may run Parallel and whose lengths may be Ell Then by a weight force a liquor through it and observe the time betwixt the first entry of the Liquor into the complicated Canal and its first  appearance at the other Orifice Then take another streight one of the same length with the former and with the same weight force the Fluid through it observing the same way the time of its passage The Lengths being the same the Velocities shall be as the time of passing reciprocally as is known Having thus got the Proportion of their Velocities in any one determined number of  Plicae  we may by the rule of  Three  have their Proportions in any assigned number thereof Supposing then that this great Man has found the truth of the foresaid Proportion from some such way as one of these follows That in every turning the volicity must be abated of the whole  Proxime  for ∷ Now let us  suppose the Proportion of the Cohesion and Fluidity of the Fluid separated in the  Testiculi Humani  to the Cohesion and Fluidity in our  Morbifick  matter now deriv'd from the Stomach into the small  Intestines  to be as to I mean the Cohesion and Fulidity of the Fluid separated in the  Testiculi Humani  as it is when immediately separated For when it has lodg'd any time in the  Vesiculae spermaticae  we know by its Ebullitions and the Evaporation of its thiner Parts it loses a great deal of its Fluidity And that this is a liberal allowance is evident from  Leuvenhoek  's Experiments scatter'd up and down the  Phil Trans  and Printed all together at  Amsterdam  where we may see from the  Microscopial  Observations he has made on this Fluid its Fluidity is little less than that of common Water  And consequently at least Ten times more than that of our  Morbifick  matter  And here I hope it will not be impertinent to set down a Proposition to compare the Viscidities of different Liquors  PROPOSITION  LET two Drops of two different Liquors fall into a pair of fine Scales a Drop of the one Liquor into the one Scale and a Drop of the other Liquor into the other Scale so that there fall no more than just their own Gravities carry down Thus you shall have what I here call their Comparative Gravities and by the ordinary Method you may likewise have their Specifick Gravities These being given I say their Viscidity and Cohesion shall be in a compounded Proportion of their Specifick  Gravities reciprocally and their comparative Gravities directly The Demonstration is easie from the Nature of Fluids  Let us again suppose the length of the small Guts for it is there only where any thing is separated from the  Intestines  to be Yards and that in every of a Yard there is a Plication And that these are likewise liberal Allowances any who have ever seen a Dissection will know Then there will be Plications in the whole and consequently the Fluid in these  Intestines  will lose but parts of the whole Celerity it had at its entry  Lastly  Let us suppose That Celerity to be equal to the Celerity of the Blood when it first enters the Plications of the  Testiculus Humanus  which all will readily  grant who consider that there is never any thing found in these small Guts but a thin Liquor in wide Canal thrust forward by the force of the  Fibres  of the Stomach and  Intestines  Let us call this Celerity  a  Now from  Corol  and about Separation If a Viscidity as give Plications then a Viscidity as will give such And therefore that such a Viscid Liquor should be separated it is requisite it should lose parts of the whole Celerity But as has been just now shown by the  Ilicae  of the  Intestines  the Fluid will lose but parts of the Celerity  a  Whence it is absolutely impossible that the  Intestines  should separate this Viscid matter unless they were a Hundred times longer than they are For ∶∷∶ If the Viscidity of the  Fluid separated in the  Testiculus Humanus  were to that of our  Morbifick  as to then the small  Intestines  ought to be Five Hundred times longer than they are And indeed I believe the Proportion really not to be under to and then they ought to be at least Hundred times longer than they are  Thus we see the second thing this Opinion supposes is false and indeed it hardly could be otherwise for in my Opinion the  Faeces  themselves might more probably get into the Mass of the Blood than this viscid matter the parts of these being only united by a simple Contact Whereas the parts of this are joyn'd by a very strong  Nisus  And I remember Dr  Lister  some where in the  Phil Trans  relates how he try'd to get in a very fine ting'd Spirit  into the  Lacteals  of a live  Dog  by cuting the small Guts and injecting the Liquor then sewing all up again But he cou'd never get it done to his Satisfaction And here it is to be observ'd that people may be deceiv'd with Blue Tinctures for this is the Natural Colour of these  Lacteals  when they are almost or altogether empty  If it be objected That the Concoction of the Stomach and  Intestines  may fit this  Morbifick  matter to be separated by the  Lacteals  That the  Peristaltick  Motion and the  Valves  of the  Intestines  may hinder the quick motion of the compounded  Chylous  matter That there are some Medicaments as  Turpentine  c which we know by their effects get into the Mass of the Blood and yet are more viscid than our  Morbifick  matter That there is rereally  as viscid matter separated in some other  Glands  as the  Bile  and the  Phlegm  To these I answer  As to the first seeing  triture  is the only effect of the Stomach and  Intestines  there is no advantage to be reap'd thence for no beating nor g  ating will dissolve the union of this  Morbifick  matter Besides where it is in any plenty the effects of Concoction are very small or none  As to the Second The  Peritaltik  motion being reciprocal it adds as much to the motion of the  Chylous  matter in it's descent towards the  Rectum  as it takes away in its ascent towards the Stomach and so cannot serve that end the  Plicae  and circumvolutions of these  Intestines  which we have consider'd being only to  be rely'd on for this purpose As to the  Valv's  we know they all open toward the  Rectum  and serve only to stop the ascent of the  Faeces  in the Peristaltick motion and so cannot retard the motion of the  Chylous  matter  As to the Third We likewise know that all these Medicaments are dissolv'd into a thin Liquor by heat as  Turpentine  Butter  c  Besides that only the most spritious and least viscid parts enter the Blood which is not said of our  Morbifick  matter  As to the last There is a great difference betwixt a Liquor immediately after it is separated and when it has Stagnated sometime in the Conservatory of the  Gland  for then the Aqueous and more humid Parts evaporate and by its stagnation it acquires an ineptitude to motion And tho the  Blood flows very easily in the  Arterys  and  Veins  yet I defy any to cause extravasat Blood enter its Vessels again But more particularly we must consider the  Liver  to be a very large Vessel and if it were evolv'd to make an  Artery  many Thousand times longer than that of the Canal of the small  Intestines  or  Testiculus Humanus  either and so it is no wonder it separate a viscid matter the motion of the Blood there being very small But still I assert it is not near so vicid as our  Morbifick  matter As to the  Phlegm  we know it is not naturally produc'd and the  Morbifick  matter it self against which we dispute might be as well objected for it is only the Stagnation Corruption and Evaporation of the Humidity which occasions both the same might be said of the Purulent matter which  passes by  Ʋrine  but that we know it proceeds from an  Ʋlcer  in the  Kidney  or Neck of the  Bladder  and is not discerned with the  Ʋrine  Having dwelt thus long on the Opinions of others I come now to consider the proper remedies of Fevers which I reduce to  Blood letting    Vomiting    Purging  And The  Medicaments  which encrease the less  Sensible Evacuations  under which head I comprehend Sweating Perspiration and the like  I do not here consider blistering and outward Applications seeing in my Opinion they are only useful to remove the accidental effects and not the cause of Fevers without which they cannot be said to be truly cur'd  As for  Blood letting  The subject is so fully and learnedly treated by  Bellini  in his foremention'd  Books together that it were equally impossible as impudent to offer at any additions And therefore for intire satisfaction on this head I shall refer my Reader to these Books  As to  Vomiting  I shall comprehend all I have design'd to say about it in these particulars I shall show that Vomiting is partly produc'd by the  vis stimulans Vomitorii  But That it is mostly occasion'd by the  vis stimulans  of the  Morbifick  matter excern'd from the  Glands  of the Stomach I shall prove that this  Morbifick  matter is not in the cavity of the Stomach at least in such plenty as it is excern'd by a forc'd Vomit before the ingestion of the said Vomit I shall give the whole destruction and connexion of this Operation And Shall consider the advantages of the same in the cure of Fevers  Before I come to handle these it is necessary I first explain what I here mean by a  vis stimulans  By a  vis stimulans  I understand such a Quality in a Fluid whereby the particles thereof are dispos'd to make a real division or a violent inflexion of the  Nervous  and  Membranous Fibres  of the Body which occasions frequent and forceable reciprocations successions and derivations of the  Liquidum Nervorum  into the  Muscles  and contractile  Fibres  of the Canals whereby all the involuntary  Muscles  are brought into violent contractions and the emissaries of the  Glands  are squeez'd  Those who desire a fuller account of the nature and mechanical Operations of this  vis stimulans  may see it  Pag  and  Seq  of  Bellini  's Book  De Ʋrinis Puls Prop  of his last Book  De Motu Cordis  I say then    Vomiting  is  Partly  produc'd by this  vis stimulans Vomitorij  This is evident from these considerations Because sometimes we immediately Vomit upon the Ingestion of the Vomitory before the  Morbifick  matter excern'd from the  Glands  of the Stomach could have time to concur We throw up very often the same we had taken in with little or no mixture which could not happen if the  Morbifick  matter had concur'd to produce the fit Sound persons in whose Stomachs there is little or none of this  Morbifick  matter often Vomit upon a too plentiful ingestion of an otherwise inoffensive Liquor The only reason of which must be that the Stomach not being able to derive into the Mass of the Blood the said Liquor so fast as it is pour'd in it must Sowr on the  Stomach and thereby acquire this  vis stimulans  whereby it is thrown out Or perhaps it may still have a  vis stimulans  tho not when it is in a small quantity sufficient to bring the Stomach into that violent contraction which is necessary in Vomiting But this small  vis stimulans  being Multiply'd by the too great quantity of the Liquor may acquire sufficient force to produce the effect as we see several things lose the quality to produce their visible Effects when in small which they had when in great But  I say Vomiting is mostly accasion'd by this  vis stimulans  of the  Morbifick  matter excern'd from the  Glands  of the Stomach and that for these reasons The action of the  vis stimulans Vomitorij  being terminated at or near the internal surface of the Stomach after  one or two plentiful fits of Vomiting there being produced thereby such a succussion and compression of the sides of the Stomach these  Particulae Stimulantes  must necessarily be disentangled and so there could be no more fits of Vomiting which is contrary to experience We evidently see in SeaVomits and in those produc'd by the Joltings of a Coach in some people there is no  vis Stimulans Vomitorij  to which we can attribute this effect and therefore it must necessarily be produc'd by the vellications of the Morbifick matter excern'd by this particular motion The manner of which may be thus explain'd every particular body has a determin'd degree of tension and a determin'd length And if a like reciprocation of motion by whatsomever cause be produc'd  in the ambient  Medium  which would necessarily be produc'd by another Body when mov'd of the same degree of tension and of length commensurable to the length of the first body there must be of necessity a motion produc'd in that first body especially if the motion of the  Medium  be violent and the commensurable lengths be as the first number's of the ordinary Arithmetical Progression to or to or to  c  This is evident in the unisone or concordant Strings of greater Musical Instruments And the Reason is because thereby the  Oscillations  of such Bodies become Commensurable Now I suppose this particular Motion of Jolting Coaches and Ships to be such as would be produc'd by another Body having the just now mention'd Analogy to the  Nerves  of the  Glands  of the  Stomach whereby they are brought into motion and consequently derive great Plenty of their  Liquidum  into the places which makes such contractions as squeez these  Glands  of the matter which produces these fits of Vomiting Besides that the same cause may upon other  Fibres  produce the antecedent Sickness which we feel in SeaVomits By a Vomit of warm water for example there are often produced several fits of Vomiting and yet we all know there is no  vis Stimulans  in it So that all it can do is that by its warmth which is a kind of a  Fotus  it elicits the matter from the  Glands  of the Stomach which occasions this Vomiting I cou'd add a great deal more to confirm this proposition but I think this sufficient I say    ly  That the  Morbifick  matter excern'd by Vomiting is not existent in the Cavity of the Stomach at least in such Plenty at it is excern'd by a forc'd Vomite before the administration thereof This is an evident Corollary from the former  Prop  The Vomite does not Act at least after the first one or two fits by it's own  vis ctimulans  There is in Vomiting produc'd a violent contraction of the  Fibres  of the Stomach the  Muscles  of the  Addomen  and  Diaphragm  which must be occasioned someway There is nothing in Vomiting which can occasion this but either the  vis  timulans Vomitorii  or of the excern'd  Morbifick  matter and since as has been already proved it can not be the former it must of necessity be the latter Wherefore if the  Morbifick  matter were already existent in the cavity of the Stomach  the Vomite were of little use after one or two Fits which is contrary to experience If this  Morbifick  matter were already in the cavity of the Stomach it is not possible but that one or two plentifull fits of Vomiting would eject all that is there so that afterward there should none be thrown out however violent the consequent fits were which is likewise contrary to experience The force of the  Muscular Fibres  of the Stomach The  Muscles  of the  Abdomen  and  Diaphragm  which two last Monsieur  Chirac  Professor of Medicine at  Montpellier  by an easy experiment has shewn to concur principally in Vomiting  vide    The Preface of Tournfort's Histoire des Plants qui Naissent aux environs de Paris  is at least equal to  lib  weight the force of the  Muscles  of the  Abdomen  and  Diaphragm  being  more than that of  libs  and of the Stomach not inferior to that of pounds which force if it be not sufficient to drive out all that is existent in the cavity of the Stomach however Viscid the matter be I leave every one to judge Supposing the  Morbifick  matter already in the cavity of the Stomach It is Impossible to give an account of the different effects of different Vomits For Example why an  Antimonial  Vomit does excern this  Morbifick  matter more plentifully than Whey or warm Water For if before the Ingestion of either the  Morbifick  matter is already in the Stomach then the only thing left for them to do is to excite the Act of Vomiting But it is certain they may be both brought to be equal in that  i e  they may be both brough to excite an equal unmber of fits of  Vomiting and that with equal violence by taking their Quantitys in a reciprocal proportion to their Vomitive Faculties And yet their effects be very different otherwise I omit for avoiding tendiousness the other arguments I can aduce to confirm this proposition    ly  The whole deduction and Connection of this operation is thus the Particles of the Vomitory by their  Incuncation  into the Orific  s of the  Emisaries  of the  Glands  adjacent to the surface of the Stomach do dilate the same which by some extrinsick cause had been contracted and after the same manner do dissolve at least in some degree the Cohesion of the stagnant  Morbifick  matter and render it more Fluid and consequently its resistance less Now the natural and constant action of the  Glands  being Secretion  and the  Impedimentum  by the dilatation of the Orifice and attenuation of the Fluid being totally taken away or at least made less than the natural  Momentum  of the  Glands  The matter must necessarly flow into the Cavity of the Stomach till it be accumulated in such a Quantity which not being to be done in an instant must require some time as is sufficient by the united loathsomeness and the  vis stimulans  of it and the Vomitory to vellicate and force the  Fibres  of the Stomach  Abdomen  and  Diaphragm  by the communication of the  Nerves  of the first with the two last into a violent contraction and thereby throw all out by the  Osophagus  which brings all to quiet again Till there be a new a sufficient quantity exerned from these  Glands  to reproduce the foresaid Contraction  And thus there happens a fit of Vomiting and Quiet alternately till either all the  Morbifick  matter be thrown out or the force of the Vomit so diluted that it's no longer able to elicit the  Morbifick  matter from the  Glands  Besides these Primary effects of Vomiting there are two others which ought not tho less principal to be omitted The first is that in a strong Vomit or in one which requires some considerable time before it operate there often passes some part thereof from the Stomach into the  Intestines  and occasions a gentle Purge by dissolving the  Faeces  and vellicating the  Fibres  of the  Intestines  as shall be more particularly shown when we speak of  Purging  However the effects of this Purge very seldom or never go beyond the  Primae Viae  For all gentle Purges of which this is one are confined  within these The second is that the strong contraction in so many  Muscles  and  Muscular  Canals which are at Work in Vomiting and the violent concussion which is produc'd over the whole Body by a power as has been said which is not inferiour to that of two Hundred and Sixty Thousand weight may and often does take away the Obstructions in many other Canals than those which are more immediately concerned about the Stomach and  Osophagus  as we evidently see by that vast Sweat which always breaks out after plentiful fits of Vomiting From these I deduce    thly  The Advantages of Vomiting in the  Cure  of Fevers which are The taking away the Obstructions of the  Glands  of the Stomach and sometimes of the  Intestines  which is the principal  use of Vomiting and how great a step this is toward the Cure of Fevers every one will see who considers that in Fevers occasion'd by Intemperance the Stomach is the Scene where this great Mischief is both contriv'd and put into Execution the Obstruction of the  Glands  thereof being the first and principal Cause of these Fevers And in Fevers occasion'd by Cold the Stomach and  Intestines  being most Expos'd and least Defended from the Cold Air receives its first and strongest Impressions which two as formerly was said have the most considerable share in the cause of our Continual Fevers And therefore it is that Vomiting being timeously and plentifully us'd very often prevents such Fevers Another Advantage of Vomiting is That by the strong Contraction of the  Muscles  and  Muscular  Canals and the violent Concussions of the whole Body thereby produced the Obstructions of many other  Glands  are remov'd as has been just now shown So that this with the former removing so considerable a part of the Cause enables Nature to perform the rest very easily A Third Convenience if not Advantage of Vomiting is That it is less dangerous than many of the Medicaments that are taken inwardly The effects of this is confin'd to the  Primae viae  by which I always mean that winding Canal which is continued from the Mouth to the  Sphincter ani  and is consequently less dangerous than those which run the Circle of the Blood For it is not to be doubted that all Alterative Medicines have more or less danger in them from the effect of  their Stimulations upon the  Nerves  their Fermentations with the Blood their Separating or Promoting the Natural Cohesions of the Liquors of the Body and their many other unknown Productions That which goes the least way must therefore have the least danger Now since it is certain that Vomiting does not go out of the Stomach and  Intestines  where the Canals are strong and wide and the Fluids are viscid and gross there must of necessity be less danger in it than in these which enter into narrower and weaker Canals fill'd with more Fluid and finer Liquors It is true indeed there is some hazard from the bursting of the Capillary Vessels of the internal Surfaces by the violent Concussions of the Body occasioned by Vomiting but this is easily prevented by Bloodletting  which ought always to preceed the plentiful use of vomitories in all Diseases Besides sometimes the violence of Vomit is too great for the strength of the Patient but this is rather the fault of the Physician than the Physick For the Strength and consequently the violence of Vomits as of all other Medicines ought to be adjusted by this Proportion  Viz  They ought to be in a compounded Proportion of the strength of the Patient and the danger of the Continuance of the Disease If this were observed none cou'd ever Err in the Administration of Medicines  III Come we now to that which we call'd the Third proper Remedy of Fevers to wit  Purging  In explaining of which I shall Shew that Vomitive and Purgative Medicines differ only in  degrees of the same Quality I shall give a short account of the several steps and of the manner of this Operation And Consider its use in the Cure of Fevers I say then  That Vomitive and Purgative Medicines differ only in the degrees of the same Quality  i e  Purgative Medicines by encreasing their force vastly and confining it to a lesser Quantity either of a Fluid or solid Body become Vomitive and Vomitive Medicines if diluted become Purgative This will be evident from these Considerations We find by Experience a strong Purge never misses if either it be very strong or the Patient not very strong to Vomit and the weaker part of a Vomit which escapes into the  Intestines  does frequently Purge us The same Medicines for example  Vinum Emeticum  taken by the Mouth will provoke Vomiting which giv'n by way of  Glister  will Purge The same obtains in all strong  Emeticks  In short all strong Medicines of either kind constantly produce both these Effects The reason of all which is this If the Medicament of either kind be so strong as immediately to vellicate and stimulate the  Fibres  of the Stomach to dilate the Orifice and attenuate the matter contain'd in the  Glands  thereof it produces Vomiting if it act but gently so as only to assist the Natural Motion of Digestion it goes by the  Intestines  and dissolves the Cohesion of the  Faeces  and finding there more sensible  Fibres  is able to bring them into violent Motions which produce Purging as shall be just now show'n It is impossible  in any other  Theory  to account how these two different Medicines shou'd upon the same Parts produce different Effects For both these Medicines are taken by the Mouth go down the  Osophagus  and enter into the Stomach either in the form of a  Liquid  or are there by it reduc'd into a  Liquid  and consequently are brought in to contact with and Operate on the same  Fibres    Glands  and  Membranes  and yet produce by their assistance two different effects It is simply impossible to explain the manner of this without saying the one acts more powerfully and forceably and makes more violent Contractions and consequently is thrown up the most patent way the other more gently and softly and has thereby time to seek out the less obvious passages    dly  The account of the several steps and of the manner of this Operation is thus Purgative Medicines being receiv'd into the Mouth and admitted into the Stomach their particles vellicate and stimulate the  Fibres  thereof and thereby encrease the digestive faculties  i e  bring the  Muscular Fibres  of the stomach the  Muscles  of the  Abdomen  and  Diaphragm  into more frequent contractions than ordinary till they are admited into the  Intestines  the  Fibres  and  Glands  of which being more sensible than those of the Stomach whose parts by the frequent rough Contacts of one against another and of the gross Bodies which are often thrown into it are as it were dead'ned they easily move and bring into frequent and forceable contractions whereby these  Glands  are squeez'd of a  Fluid which lubricates the Passages and mixing with the feculent matter of the  Intestines  which is rendered Fluid by the same active and Stimulating quality of the Purgative medicine renders it yet more Fluid by which and by the more than ordinary contractions of the  Intestines  it passes more plentifully and easily into the  Rectum  and is thence ejected This is the use of the more gentle Purges which only cleanse the  Intestines  But those of more force besides all these do as to the greater and more spirituous part enter into the Mass of the Blood by the  Lacteals  and mixing therewith produce many unnatural fermentations therein separating or promoting the natural Cohesions of the Liquors of the Body and accasioning many other unknown effects as has been formerly said  And likewise there vellicating the spiral  Fibres  of the  Arteries  and  Veins  bring these into more forceable contractions and thereby promote the Circulation of the Blood and make it run with greater Velocity and force and by this means in a short time wash away any obstructions that either happen to be in the more direct  Arteries  or the more complicated ones which constitute the  Glands  encrease the insensible perspiration and purifie the Blood of all the grosser and more noxious parts by the  Ductus Cholodochus  and  Pancreaticus  which void themselves into the  Intestines  All these effects of the more powerful Purgatives are Visible for sometime after one has taken such a strong Purge we find the Pulse mightily encreas'd the Perspiration augmented the Spirits or  Liquidum Nervorum  spent  spent the visible Excretions by Siege and Urine much greater and the Body weak'ned especially after a few days of such a course Whereby it is evident these Medicines must operate after the manner  w explained From hence it is clear    dly  That the advantages of Purging in the cure of Fevers are very great upon these two considerations If the Purge be more gentle so that it only serve to cleanse the  Intestines  it partly takes away the obstruction of the  Glands  of the Stomach and totally that of the  Glands  of the  Intestines  which is a considerable step towards the cure But If the Purge be more violent so that it enter in any plenty into the Mass of the Blood it conduces so much toward the removal of the obstructions of most of the other  Glands    that nature is able to perform the rest very easily her self But alas this last case has so much danger and so many inconveniencies in it as render it as unsafe as otherwise if these could be remov'd it would be useful  Bellini  in his Book  De Ʋrinis Pulsibus    page  has demonstrated that in violent Purges there is a greater danger by far than in Bloodletting His words are  Quia vero quicquid est suspicionis in missione Sanguinis ad solum fermentationem non naturalem quae possibilis per ipsam est in reliquo Sanguine redigitur hoc uno de nomine periculo non vacat si igitur hujus mali suspicione careret purgatio illa potius adhibenda quam venae sectio cum purgatio ejus loco caetroquin esse possit sed res e converso se habet suspicio enim ejus mali a missione Sanguinis est suspicio  rei possibilis non tamen necessario prevenientis aut necessario conjunctae cum qualibet missione Sanguinis in purgatione autem necessarium semper est Sanguinem solvi a naturalibus Cohesionibus seu recedere dimoveri a sua compositione In Purgatione igitur periculum erit certum in venae sectione dubium hoc est erit Purgatio venae sectione periculosior  c  And therehe goes on to shew how muchmore dangerous Purging is than Bloodletting From this and a great deal more he has there adduc'd it is evident That violent Purges have a great deal of real danger in them absolutely without respect to other remedies and indeed these unatural Fermentations and changes of the Cohesion of the Fluids instead of promoting the cure often encreases the cause of Fevers to wit the obstruction of the  Arteries  which  constitute the  Glands  That violent Purges are respectively much more dangerous than Bloodletting wherefore this last is a more safe and consequently a more useful expedient in the cure of Fevers than the former And I say That violent Purges are a much more dangerous remedy in Fevers than Vomitings are For Vomits extend no further than the  Primae Viae  where the Canals are strong and wide the Fluid viscid and Gross But violent Purges reach all the slender Vessels and Noble Liquors of the Body where the danger of any Considerable alteration is extreamly great Wherefore upon this account I say that the danger of Violent Purges is to that of Vomiting as the length of the Canals of the whole Circuit of the Blood is to the length of the Canals of the  Primae Viae  And how  much longer the first is than the latter I leave the Reader to consider Besides all these there are so many other known and evident dangers in violent Purges that the only part of Purging which is safe in curing Fevers is  Glistering    the  Lotiones Alvi  or rather  either of these only that gentle Purge which is the concomitant of every plentiful Vomiting  IV We are come now to the last proper Remedy of Fevers which was the  Medicaments which encrease the less sensible evacuations  But all that can be pertinently said on this head is so learnedly and accurately already handled in a Treatise entituled  Archibaldi Pucarnij Dissertatio de Curatione febrium quae per Evacuationes instituitur  that thither I shall refer the Reader only adding the reason why such Medicaments Administred in  the begining of Fevers do rather encrease than cure them which is this In an Obstruction of the  Glands  the Blood in the Complicated  Arteries  which constitutes the same stagnates up to the next Branching thereof nearest the Heart and thereby a considerable length thereof becomes obstructed and unpassable the only way this obstruction can be remov'd is by the force of the Blood which in every Pulse or contraction of the heart washes off a particle of the same till the whole be dig'd away as shall be shown Now the  Arteries  which constitute the  Glands  whereby the insensible evacuations are naturally secern'd being in the begining of the Fever so much obstructed It is simply impossible for such Medicaments to carry these obstructions off as they are just now they must rather force  through the superficial  Arteries  and those few other  Glands  that are perhaps left passable the natural humidity only  i e  the thinest Parts of the Blood and consequently make it more viscid and thereby the obstruction more firm  i e  will encrease the Fever whereas when a great deal of these obstructions in the  Arteries  are wash'd away by the force of the Blood  i e  in or near the decline of these Fevers such Medi+caments will be able to force the small remainder of these obstructions either through the Orifice of the  Gland  or into the continued  Vein  till by frequent circulations it be either lost or thrown out of the Body  From all that has hitherto been said about the cure of these Fevers It is evident  COROLLARIA  THAT the first thing incumbent upon a Physician in the case of these Fevers is to let a considerable quantity of Blood both in order to remove the cause of these Fevers and to prevent the inconveniencies of the subsequent Vomiting  Bellini  in  Prop  and  De Febribus  has demonstrated that  Vena in omni morbo est secanda in quo minuenda quantitas aut augenda velocitas aut refriger andum aut humectandum aut aliquid adhoerens vasis dimovendum aut abripiendum  Than which there cou'd be nothing more pat to our Theory  The Second step in the Cure of these Fevers is Vomiting for it at least removes the Obstructions of the Stomach and  Intestines  and goes a great length to take away  the Obstructions of the most of the other  Glands  likewise This especially obtains in Fevers occasion'd by Intemperance or Cold As is evident from what we have said about Vomiting But as for Purging in Fevers there is very little more safe than what is the necessary Concomitant of all such Vomitings  The last but most Universal and surest step is the encreasing the less Sensible Evacuations But this must be used only in the decline of these Fevers as has been just now shown  I have in this place only determined the Order and the several Degrees of the Efficacy of these Remedies in the Cure of Fevers with respect to one another Their Kinds and Quantities being to be adjusted by a former Analogy I have given when I was speaking  about the Advantages of Vomiting  But here it may be very fairly ask'd why since I make the Obstructions of the  Artery  and  Nerve  which constitute the  Glands  the principal cause of Fevers do not I allow Mercurial Medicines which all grant to be one of the most proper and perhaps  Specifick  remedies of obstructions to be one of the steps of the cure of these Fevers  Before I answer this question I shall Explain the nature of Mercury I shall shew the manner of the Operation of these Medicines and The advantages and usefulness of them  I  As to the first I Suppose  That pure Mercury or Quicksilver consists of parts I mean those of the first composition  by which I understand an aggregate of the Smallest and last constituent Particles of any Body and an aggregate of these aggregates I call of the Second composition and so on exceedingly small equal and perfectly Sepherical  This has been suppos'd by all who have written any thing tolerable about the Nature of this Mineral it is true indeed some have suppos'd it so because they saw that dividing Mercury upon a plain even by the assistance of a Microscope still the upper part retain'd its Sphericity which they could not so easily observe in other Fluids But the true Reason of this is The great Gravity of the Mercury in respect of other Fluids and the uniform pressure of the Medium For all Fluids will retain their Sphericity till their  Quantity be so diminish'd either by their being another Heterogeneous specifically lighter Body included in them or by their Gravity decreasing at a greater rate than their Surfaces that they are of equal Gravity with unequal Portion of the Medium they are in and then they will receive any Figure the Motion of the Medium can imprint on them However the divisions of Mercury must be very small before it can be reduc'd to this State but that it can at last be brought to it is evident from the mixing and pounding of Quicksilver among common water in which we know a part of the Quicksilver is lost by the Diminution of its weight and the discolouring and effects of this Water  But the true Reason why the former Supposition is to be made  is because from it some of the Phenomena of Mercury may be accounted for  For from thence it is evident why Mercury tho' the heaviest known Fluid rises with fewer degrees of Heat in an Alembick than any other It's parts of the first Composition being exceedingly small  i e  smaller than such parts of any other Fluid it must rise sooner than they because the Gravity of its Particles has a lesser Proportion to their Surfaces than the Gravity of the Particles of any other Fluid has to their Surfaces for the Gravities of Bodies decrease in a Triplicate Proportion whereas their Surfaces decrease only in a Duplicate one Thus supposing for Example the Diameter of a Particle of Mercury of the first Composition to be to the Diameter of a Particle of Water  of the same Composition As to and we may justly suppose the Odds infinitely greater their Surfaces will be as to And their Solidities  i e  their Gravities as to This upon Supposition their Specifick Gravities were equal but supposing at the largest the Specifick Gravity of Mercury to that of Water as to The real Gravities of such Particles will be to one another as to Whence it is evident that not only the  ratio  of to or to is much less than that of to or to And therefore upon such Supposition it will follow That the Gravities of such Particles of Mercury wou'd be much less than that of such Particles of Water And that the Surfaces of these Particles of Mercury wou'd be much larger in respect of their Gravities than that of the like Particles of Water in respect of their Gravities and consequently the Mercury wou'd rise in the Alembick with much Fewer degrees of Heat than the Water upon this account But  The Particles of Mercury are perfectly Spherical and Equal for all Homogeneous Bodies must consist of Particles  Similes aequales  in the  Euclidean Sense    Vide Def        Euclid  and consequently can only touch in points and thereby their Sublimation will become more easie A Sphere can be touch'd but by other equal Spheres and that too but in so many Points and if we suppose the Superficial Particles of the Mercury to be first rais'd in the Alembick they can be touch'd only by other Now the Force and Value of such a contact as this of Points is less  Caeteris paribus  than that of other solid Bodies generated by the Circumrotation of what ever Figure Regular or Irregular Rightlin'd or Curvelin'd For The Contacts of Circles is the Measure of the Contacts of all other Figures whatsoever and tho in some Curves their Contacts in some Points may be less than that of Circles  vide Scholium Lem    Princip Phil Mathem Newtoni  yet in all their other Points they will be Proportionally  greater and consequently the value of the whole Contacts greater than that of Circles wherefore it is evident that Spherical Bodies will be more easily separated than any other and consequently will rise in the Alembick with fewer degrees of Heat than any other  I Suppose      dly  That the only Effect of the Sublimations and other Preparations of Mercury is the dividing it into these parts of the first CompositioN which are Spherical  Per suppos  Or into parts of a more complicated Composition which by reason of the vast Gravity of Mercury in respect of other Fluids and the uniform pressure of the  Medium  may be still Spherical For if the Mercury be pure and no Heterogeneous lighter Body be mix'd with it it will still retain its Sphericity till the  ratio  of the Surface of a Particle of Mercury to its Gravity be to the  ratio  of the Surface of a Particle of Air to its Gravity as is the Specifick Gravity of Mercury to the Specifick Gravity of the Air  i e  putting the Specifick Gravity of Mercury  to that of Air as  m  to  n  and the Diameter of a Particle of Mercury  x  and that of a Particle of Air  a  till  m  ∶  u  ∷  x  ∶  a  Then  x  will be equal to  na    m  that is supposing  a  equal to Unity as the Standard  m  to  n  as to  proxime  as all know the Diameter of a Particle of Mercury must be times less than that of a Particle of Air or the Particles of Mercury themselves times less than these of Air before they lose their Sphericity Now besides these divisions into Spherical Particles the Saline Bodies which are mix'd with the Mercury in these Preparations keep these asunder and disjoin'd like so many congeal'd little Bullets separated by the Fixation of some Liquor This is as I suppose the whole effect of these Preparations as is evident from what Mr  Boyle  and all other  Chymists  have found to wit That from all the Transmutations and Preparations of Mercury they cou'd elicite the same  uniform heavy Fluid which cou'd never happen if there were any other besides the now mention'd effect produc'd by these Preparations For by what means soever you dissolve this congeal'd Seperation the greater Gravity of Mercury brings its Particles into their former Union and thereby reduces them into the same Fluid Quicksilver Besides these two Suppositions it is to be observ'd  That the chief Ingredients in Mercurial Preparations are besides it self common and Armoniack Salts and their Spirits the Spirit and Oyl of  Niter    Vitriol  and its Spirit and the like which afterward we shall call by the General Name of  Saline Bodies  All which we know are endued with a vast power to vellicate and stimulate the more sensible parts of Animal Bodies and consequently to produce Vomitings and Purging of themselves according to their Quantity and the degrees of their Natural force  That the only effect of repeated Sublimations in these Preparations is  the division of the Mercury into smaller Particles and the freeing of these from the Grosser and more Noxious parts of these  Saline Bodies  for Mercury sublimating more quickly and easily than these other  Saline Bodies  must in repeated Sublimations have a greater proportion to the  Saline  Mixture than in the first Sublimations and consequently the subsequent Sublimations must have less of those  Saline Bodies  than the  Antecedent  whereby the Preparation will become sweeter and less vellicating This is evident from the  aquila alba panacea Mercurialis  which are all much heavier specially than any other Preparations of Mercury  These things premis'd I come to explain  II The manner of the Operation of Mercurial Medicines In performing which I distinguish two Cases Either the Medicine is taken inwardly Or It is apply'd outwardly under which head I comprehend both Mercurial Inunctions and Plasterings As to the After the Medicine is taken by the Mouth it  desends into the Stomach and there the Saline parts of the Composition vellicat the  Fibres  thereof which occasion those Gripes are felt upon the taking these Medicines And if the Salin Particles have a considerable share in the Composition they so powerfully stimulat the  Fibres  of the Stomach as to bring it into these Contractions which produce Vomiting as has been formerly explain'd The Mercury it self with some of the remainder of the Saline Particles sliping into the  Intestines  do likewise vellicat these and occasion a Gentle Purge which Effect tho' it be constant in the first days after taking these Medicines yet it is never so violent as that of other Purgatives because most of it's force is spent in the stomach Now that both the Vomiting and Purging produc'd by these Medicines are owing to the saline parts of the composition is evident from the nature of Mercury and the effect produc'd in it by the Chymical preparations thereof just now explain'd For Mercury consisting of  spherical Particles and by such preparations being only divided into these of themselves as being spherical these particles cou'd never occasion the stimulatitions which as has been formerly shown are necessary to produce these effects The only thing they can contribute towards them is that by their excessive gravity and smallness they are capable to dissolve the Cohesion of the more viscuous Fluids of the stomach and  Intestines  and consequently make them flow more easily when the  Muscular Fibres  of these parts are otherwise brought into contractions Besides we see that the forementioned effects are mostly produc'd by those compositions in which most of these  Saline Bodies  enter As in the corrosive Sublimate the White and Yellow Precipitate But in the others which pass many Sublimations as the Sweet Sublimate and the  Panacea Mercurialis  we judge of their goodness as they produce least of these effects I ascribe the Sweating produc'd by a dose of some of these compositions partly to the  violence of the Vomitting and partly to the Saline Particles which enter the composition and that small salivation to the Imediate action of these  Saline Bodies  upon the Salivary  Glands  and not to the Mercury it self All these will be evident to any who have seen the sudden effects of these Medicines which have not had sufficient time neither to enter nor circulate with the Blood so as to be able to produce the mentioned  Sweating  or salivation after the ordinary manner Thus I have endeavoured to explain the effects of these Medicines while they are in the  Primae Viae  I shall now show the manner of their Operation in producing a  Flux de Bouche  that thereby the lesser effects of this kind may be understood  The Mercury being free'd by the action of the stomach and the heat of the Liquors contain'd in the same and in the  Intestines  of most of the saline part of the composition enters the Blood by the  Lacteals  and is with it carried about through the Canals  where either it or any Liquor of the Body generated by it Flows the small remainder of these Saline Particles which adheres to the Mercury after the action of the Stomach and  Intestines  assisting the propagation of the motion by the velicating the sides of the Canals And having the same Celerity but a much greater weight it has consequently a greater force and produces a stronger  Ictus  and thereby when once any considerable quantity thereof has enter'd the Blood it by it's great force and the smallness of its particles disolves the unatural Cohesions of all the Liquors renders them more Fluid and active and likewise digs out all the Obstructions of the impassable Canals like so many little Bullets shot against a mud Wall every little Bullet breaks down a part till the whole be levelled and this it is the more able to perform both because it is exceeding weighty and makes therefore a greater and more forceable  Ictus  and because it's particles are exceeding small and are therefore to be consider'd as so many exceeding  sharp Wedges or  Cunei  Besides by the smallness of it's Particles it is able to enter into these slender Canals in which the Blood cannot freely pass and thereby to scour all the Passages be they never so small And that there are Canals through which the Globules of the Blood cannot freely pass we are convinc'd from Microscopial Experiments Thus all the Liquors of the Body being attenuated and consequently their celerity and force rendered greater and all the Canals scour'd and render'd passable the whole  Glands  of the Body are set a work and throw out the more noxious and less Fluid parts of their Liquors by reason the particles of the Mercury either dissolve or carry before them all the gross particles which resist them and thereby the Perspiration Urine Salivation are encreas'd the quantity of the Fluids lessen'd and the whole Body emaciated till there be nothing left but pure and useful Liquors and clear and passable Canals Those who can only be convinc'd by occular Demonstration  may see a kind thereof in  Phil Trans  for  Jan  where  Leuvenhoeck  from Microscopial Experiments on  Tadpoles  confirms the main of this Doctrine as to the manner of the taking away Obstructions  But there is another Effect of Mercurial Medicines which is noways to be forgotten for besides these mention'd Effects it distroys that corrosive Faculty of the Liquors which bursts the superficial Vessels and produces those constant pains Scabs Ulcers and the like which we feel For supposing an Obstruction in any Vessel either by the corrosiveness or Viscidity of the Liquor or from some extrinsick cause the Liquor Stagnates and Coagulates there and by the force of the fluent part of that Liquor and by the Corrosiveness of the stagnated part the Vessels are Miserably distended and their parts dilacerated which occasions constant pain in that part or they burst and the Liquor putrifying occasions a Botch Scab or Ulcer more or less Dangerous and painful as the corrosiveness  of the stangnated and putrifying Fluid is greater or lesser Now this corrosive Faculty must proceed from the pointedness of the particles perhaps these particles may consist of four equilateral Triangled plains for such have the greatest equal degree of acuteness on all their points which seems necessary to make them equable in their Actions and Homogeneous in their Natures of the stagnated Fluid Now the Mercury will not only remove the Obstruction and make the Vessel passable by its weight but likewise by the same will break off and plain the points and Angles of these Particles and so render them Harmless and innocent for  Sublata causa  c  But here it may be objected that the grand effect as most People believe of Mercurial Medicines is Salivation and that really the Salivary  Glands  secern more of their Fluid proportionally than any other  Glands  of the Body which is contrary to the  Prop  about Secretion To this I Answer  That the principal effect of Mercury is the attenuating the Fluids the clearing the Canals and the destroying the Corrosiveness of the Obstructions and that salivation has no more title to be the principal effect of Mercury than insensible perspiration For all the  Glands  notwithstanding the Objection secret their respective Liquors in the proportion mentioned in  prop  about Secretion It is evident that salivation is not the main effect of Mercury from this That many persons are cur'd of very dangerous Poxes Ulcers and Rheumrtisms without ever Salivating at least at the ordinary rate of Salivation But The reason why we seem to secern more by the salivary  Glands  proportionally than by any or most others are these The salivary  Glands  are more in number than any of those which separate visible Fluids and consequently it is but reasonable they shou'd secern more than any other It is true the  Glands  of insensible perspiration are more in number than those and it is not to be doubted but  they secern more likewise and it will be found so when ever the thing is examined after  Sanctorius  's method but that secretion not being visible makes the matter doubted The Canals which constitute the  Glands  of salivation are evidently wider than these of others as is clear from their spungy and soft Contexture and so it is very accountable from the mentioned  Prop  why they secern more plentifully The Fluid lecern'd in the Salivary  Glands  is Ropy and Viscid and one part draws forward another which does not happen in most other  Glands  and upon this account it is no wonder that those secern more than these The Salivary  Glands  in some People have not so good a Contexture and so obvious a course as in others And this is the Reason why some Salivat little or none and others too much But The true account of the Matter is this The  Saliva  being a tough ropy Substance cannot be thrust out so fast as the Mercury carries it forward especially seeing it seperates only the most Glutinous  parts of this  Saliva  whence all the Salivary  Glands  begin to swell untill there be such a quantity accumulated as together with the force of the Mercury and of the succeeding Fluid is able to burst the Orifices of the  Glands  And it is observable the Salivation continues only so long as any of the  Glands  are found swell'd Whence it is evident that this plentiful Salivation depends upon this That the Fluid is as it were laid up in store to be deriv'd more plentifully afterwards whereas in the other  Glands  the Fluid being thiner is secern'das fast as it is driv'n forward And hence it comes to pass that we think the  Saliva  secern'd is much greater in Quantity than what is deriv'd from the other  Glands  If we take in all these Considerations together they will account for the plentiful Salivation by Mercury  As to the second Case In Mercurial Inunctions the viscid Matter in which the Quicksilver is wrought and pounded serves only to keep the small Particles thereof separated and  asunder and to apply them to the Skin till by frequent rough Frictions the smallest Particles of the Mercury are forced through the sides of the Cuticular  Arteries  into the Blood and when once they are got thither they are in the Estate just now Mention'd and operate after the manner already explain'd And indeed this were the shortest and easiest course of raising a  Flux de Bouche  if Mercury cou'd be adjusted to the Strength and Constition of the Patient for the Quantity of Mercury which will kill one will not produce the design'd effect of Salivation in another by this Method as exactly as by Administring it gradually in Doses by the Mouth But it cannot be done so and therefore the latter course is the more safe  Mercurial Plaisters apply'd outwardly to heal Scabs or inveterate Ulcers operate thus The Corosive saline mixture if there by any part thereof in the Composition eats away and corrodes the putrid Matter which sears up the Mouths of the Vessels so that the Mercurial Particles get easily into  them where they both clear the Vessel of the Obstructions and destroy the pointedness of the Particles of the Fluid which two things did concur to make the Ulcer sore If there be no Saline Body in the Application then the Mercury must be forc'd in by Friction into the Mass of the Blood to produce the design'd effect  Thus from a few easie and evident  Postulates  I have giv'n an intelligible account of the Manner of the Operation and of the Effects of Mercurial Medicines when the Mercury enters in any Quantity into the mass of the Blood and from thence it will be easily understood that when the quantity is less the Effects will be proportionally lesser Sore that it will be needless to explain all the several degrees thereof by detail But seeing it is evident from  Leuvenhoeck  's Observations in the last mention'd  Phil Trans  That the force of the Blood is able to wash away some Obstructions let us take a gross estimat of the Proportion of the Efficacy of the Blood assisted by Mercury to the Efficacy of the Blood of it self and unassisted to take away  Obstructions First Then we must consider if instead of the ordinary Liquors there pass'd nothing but Mercury in the Canals of the Body the weight of Blood being to that of Mercury as to or as to at least and their Velocities being the same Mercury wou'd at least be times more able to remove the Obstruction than the Blood of self But it is certain if the Obstruction renders the Canal impassible there can no Particle of the Mercury get away and when there is any quantity thereof got into the Blood there are still some new Particles thereof coming up so that after some time they having a greater  Momentum  than the  Globules  of the Blood and thereby getting through it up to the Obstruction we may consider there will be little or nothing save Mercurial Particles at or near the Obstruction driven against it by the whole force of the Blood So that as to the Obstruction it self it is very near the same as if the whole Canals run Mercury However let us take the Proportion only as to so that upon this account the Blood  assisted by any considerable quantity of Mercury will be times more able to remove the Obstruction than the Blood unassisted    dly  Let us consider the  Globules  of the Blood are Elastick for they often lose their Figure in strait Canals and recover it again as  Leuvenhoeck  has shown which is the Definition of Elasticity and those of Mercury are not or very little so And consequently upon this account the Efficacy of the  Globules  of Blood will be hugely diminish'd Let us suppose it looses ¼ of its Efficacy which is a liberal allowance and then the Proportion will be ¾ to or to    dly  Let us observe That the  Globules  of the Blood and Mercury driven against the Obstruction and at every Pulse digging away a part of the same may be considered as  Cunei  now  caeteris paribus  the Force or Efficacy of  Cunei  is reciprocally proportional to the Angles their Edges make But in spheres the lesser or greater degree  of Curvity is to be consider'd as these Angles when these spheres are consider'd as  Cunei  And the degrees of Curvity in spheres as in Circles are reciprocally as their  Radii  Supposing then the Diameter or  Radius  of a Particle of Mercury is to that of a  Globule  of Blood as to and there can be Reasons given some of which I have formerly hinted why the Odds may be suppos'd much greater then the force of the Mercury and the Blood to that of the Blood unassisted to remove Obstructions will be as to Lastly let us consider that by the force of the Mercury the Liquors of the Body are exceedingly attenuated and render'd more moveable and are thereby capacitated to receive a stronger Impression so that they both move more quickly and with greater force as is evident from the Pulse of those who are under a  Flux de Bouche  whose Pulse is little less frequent and strong than the Pulse of those in a Fever Let us suppose the Proportion both of the frequency of their Pulse and of its strength to that  of an ordinary one as to and this is certainly much less than the truth Then it will be as to upon the account of its greater force and again as to upon the account of its greater frequency that is as to So that now upon this last and all the former accounts the proportion of the Efficacy of the Blood assisted by any considerable quantity of Mercury to that of the Blood unassisted to remove an Obstruction will be as to or as to So that the first will be times more effectual for that end than the latter But if any shou'd still think we have made too liberal Allowances for the Mercury let us rebate the Proportion one third part yet still the Blood assisted by any considerable quantity of Mercury will be able to do as much toward the removal of an Obstruction in one day as the Blood unassisted in three years almost  Besides there are a great many cases in which the Blood unassisted is so far from being able to remove the Obstruction that it will continually encrease  the same For if the Obstruction proceed from a Depravation of the Liquors of the Body as in  Rheumatisms  or if some corroding matter be forc'd into the Liquors so as to be able to vitiate the same as in Poxes Pests and Poisons it is demonstrable that without some external assistance either by Diet or Medicines the Malady instead of mending by length of time will encrease But if the Obstruction proceed from some external injury as in Bruises Wounds Colds and perhaps all continual Fevers the Liquors still persisting in their Natural and Wholesome Estate may do much to drive away the same by length of time but still the sooner and more safely if they be assisted by convenient Medicines I come to  III The Advantage and Usefulness of Mercurial Medicines  And They are useful for destroying the Viscidity and Thickness the Corrosiveness and Pointedness of the Particles of the whole Liquors of the Body rendring them Fluid and  moveable Innocent and Harmless if before they were otherwise  They are evidently useful for removing all Obstructions Ulcers Scabs Botches Swellings constant Pains all which are but the effects of some kind of Obstruction or other of whatever Nature or Kind by adjusting only their Quantities rightly but that is the Work of an able Physician  Now for answer to the Question which gave occasion to this Discourse Mercurial Medicines were exceedingly useful and wou'd answer the whole design in Curing Fevers were it not upon these two Accounts Before they cou'd be effectual for this purpose they ought to be Administred in a large quantity which never misses by the violence and force of the Motion of the Blood thereby occasion'd to induce a new Fever in the Patient of  self so that instead of Curing the former Fever it wou'd double it and make the danger double which by no means is to be done the Patient having enough a do to wrestle with one But It requires so long time to  bring the effects of Mercurial Remedies to any height that the Patient in so long a space wou'd be Cur'd by the force of Nature or kill'd by the Violence of the Disease so that upon this account they are rendred useless Besides there are a Thousand other Inconveniencies which render this Method in its full force altogether impracticable  After all I remember to have been told some time ago by that Eminent Physician of our Countrey whom I have thrice already mention'd That People who have been severely flux'd seldom fall into dangerous Fevers and that in Fevers of Children occasion'd by Worms Mercury if discreetly us'd is always and in some Fevers of riper years is often very successful The Reason of both which is very evident from our Doctrine  For in those who have been severely Flux'd the Blood is so purify'd and render'd so Fluid and all the Canals are so cleans'd and scour'd that if at any time there shou'd happen  such Obstructions as occasion Fevers Nature is able in a short time to drive them away seeing they must rather happen from some external cause than from within where all is clear and passable  As for Fevers occasion'd by Worms among the Fluids in the Bodies of young Persons which by the way is an Argument omitted for our Theory of continual Fervers as is likewise the  Febris Variolarum  both which are occasion'd by Obstructions as is evident from the botches which break out upon the latter and as shall be just now shown of the former For here a little Worm being forc'd into some of the capillary  Arteries  where it can neither get back nor forward totally occludes the passage of the Blood and thereby occasions a Fever after the manner already explain'd Now the Reason why the natural force of the Blood is not able to remove such an Obstruction is because a living Creature makes it which will  not be mouldred away after the manner of Coagulated Blood But will require the greater weight and force the Mercury to kill it first and then both the Mercury and Blood concuring wash it away  FINIS
