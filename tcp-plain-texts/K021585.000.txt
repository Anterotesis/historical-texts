 THE EVIDENT ADVANTAGES TO  Great Britain  and its ALLIES FROM THE Approaching WAR Especially in Matters of TRADE  To which is Added Two Curious Plans One of the PORT and BAY of HAVANA the other of PORTOBELO  LONDON  Printed And Sold by J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  and A DODD in the  Strand  Price  s    February  This Day is Publish'd the SECOND EDITION of  The Evident Approach of a WAR and Something of the Necessity of it in order to Establish PEACE and Preserve TRADE  Pax Quaeritur Bello  To which is Added an Exact Plan and Description of the Bay and City of  Gibraltar  PREFACE  THE evident Approach of a War having been spoken to with some Approbation the evident Advantages of it to  GreatBritain  seem as natural to be spoken to as they are necessary  The same Hand therefore applies it self to this Part however officiously yet with the same Sincerity to encourage the Nation in the prosecuting of the War when it shall be begun  If the many Disappointments which the  Spaniards  have met with in forming their Designs and the dull Prospects they have before them in carrying them on have not prevail'd on them to take better Measures or to act a wiser Part but that they will go on in spight not of Reason only but even of Nature that very Obstinacy is an Encouragement to us who have so many Assurances of Success in every Branch of the War  But when the Advantages to our Commerce come to be weighed also and added  to the Advantages of the War one would be apt to say that as the  Spaniards  seem infatuated in the Beginning it we should all be infatuated if we did not take hold of the Occasion  The Author desires to capitulate for so much Favour however otherwise discouraged that as this Tract is written with the same sincere Affection to the publick Interest as well of the Government as of the whole Nation as the former it may be accepted in the same manner he earnestly wishes that the Advantages to our Commerce which so evidently offer on the Occasion of this War may be embrac'd that our Trade which at this Time suffers under many other Difficulties may at least revive upon the Follies of our Enemies and by those very Steps by which they think to ruin it  He is also ready at any time to disclose some remaining Advantages of this War as they relate to Commerce which seem yet not to be noticed by our Superiors and to recommend them to Practice and that without any Prospect of Interest or Hopes of Reward  THE EVIDENT  Advantages  to GREAT BRITAIN and its ALLIES from the  Approaching  WAR  CHAP I  That the first Scheme of the  Spaniards  Designs might be said to have some Weight in them That the Disappointments they have met with ought to have made them despair and give over but that their obstinate pursuing those broken Measures notwithstanding their Disappointments makes them appear Ridiculous and Absurd  WHAT has hitherto been spoken of the Certainty and Necessity of a War and of its Evident Approach has been founded upon the Discoveries made by the Enemy themselves or by the general Knowledge of Things as the Publick Affairs of  Europe  had an evident Tendency in their Consequences to a Rupture  What can't be otherwise must be so  It is no great Concession in this Argument for an Author to say he is no PrivyCounsellor no SecretService Man that he sees only  without Doors  and judges only from  what is  to  what may be  The  Spaniards  and even the  Imperialists  who in this Discourse and for this Occasion in particular we call the Enemy have taken care to act not as if they design'd the Thing should be a Secret or that they would amuse the World about it and that we should be at an Uncertainty in the Question whether they design'd to make a War of it or no they seem rather to be removing all possible Doubts about it from our Thoughts and making it appear not that they really intended it but that it can be no otherwise that the  Rubicon  was past the Thing determined and that it could not be avoided  This made the former Discourse upon this Subject bear the Title of Evident  The Evident Approach  c intimating that the War was Evident and Visible in its Approach and that they must have some Defect in their Understanding who made any longer Doubt of it that the Parties were as they say of Armies in full March to Engage Indeed it seems to cost the  Spaniards  some Pains to obtain a Belief among Mankind that they were in Earnest for such Difficulties offered themselves in the Thing it self to the meanest and most common Observation that it was not easy to bring People to believe the  Spaniards  Weak enough to be in Earnest or that they were really entering upon a War and especially making themselves Aggressors in which they were as certain to be Losers as as they were to be Parties as certain to be beaten as to fight and in which indeed it could by the Nature of Things be no otherwise  For this Reason I must confess it seemed a necessary Piece of Work to perswade the People to believe the  Spaniards  intended a War and that therefore That was first to be laid down as a Principle and rendered as Undeniable as all Principles in Matters of Dispute ought to be and how could this be done better than by the concurring Testimony of the Enemy themselves either declared in plain Words at length or gathered as the Natural Consequences of all their Actions  When I say the Meaning of an Enemy appears from the natural Consequences of their Actions I must be allowed to argue thus When I see plainly that a Man resolves to put such Hardships such Pieces of Injustice and such Affronts upon me as he has good Reason to know I will not and ought not to bear without the most Scandalous Reproach to my Character the utmost Damage and Loss to my Interest and the utmost Danger and Hazard to my Life and that therefore he knows at the same Time such Usage of me will force me to resist him and repel Force with Force when I see him I say acting in such a Manner I may without Injury to him conclude That in short he designs to Quarrel with me it is the natural Consequence of the Thing the Language of his Behaviour speaks it as plain as if he sent me a Challenge or defy'd me in Words at length  Thus in Case of the Conduct of the several Powers we are now speaking of When we see them Leaguing and Confederating together forming a Strength of Interests entering into Secret Engagements and those Secret Engagements pointed directly and particularly at the Interest of  Great Britain  at  the Person Honour and Royal Dignity of his Majesty as King of  Great Britain    It we see them concerting Measures for the somenting Divisions Feuds and Factions among the People and raising Rebellion and Civil War in the Heart of his Majesty's Dominions  If we see them breaking all Faith and Honour Pledg'd and Engaged in the most solemn Manner by espousing that despicable Interest which they had Renounced and Promised effectually to Abandon and Reject I mean that of the Pretender whom they had mutually engag'd not to Assist or Support in any manner whatsoever and that those Engagements were entered into in such Terms  The Terms of the mutual Engagement between the two Courts of  Vienna  and  Madrid  are said to be expresly thus  To Undertake to place the Pretender upon the Throne of  Great Britain  as could not be broken without a Violation of Honour in such a Manner as few Persons of such Dignity in the World could ever satisfie themselves to be guilty of  If we see them tho' Crowned Heads tho' Princes and Christian Princes stooping so far below the Dignity of Crowned Heads as to encourage Treason and Rebellion supporting Subjects in Traiterous Designs against their Sovereign which Sovereign both these Crowned Heads had Own'd and Receiv'd in the Quality of Lawful and Rightful and had Solemnly and in a particular Manner Engaged not to disturb in the Possession of his said Lawful and Rightful Government as above  The Sixth Article of the Treaty of  Utrecht  runs thus  'The Catholick King doth Promise as well in his own Name as in that of his Heirs and Successors That they will not at any Time disturb or molest the QUEEN her Heirs and Successors of the  Protestant  Line being in Possession of the Crown of  Great Britain  and the Dominions Subject thereunto Neither will the said Catholick King or any of his Successors give at any Time any  Aid    Succour    Favour  or  Counsel  directly or indirectly to any Person or Persons who on any Cause or Pretence shall hereafter endeavour to Oppose the said Succession by Open War or by any Conspiracies against such Prince and Princes possessing the said Throne of  Great Britain  as aforesaid'  If we see them Leaguing and Confederating for the forming Interests destructive to the Commerce of these Kingdoms laying open such Branches of Trade as by former Leagues and Conventions were expresly Limited and Restrain'd Invading the Commerce which it was expresly Stipulated should not  be invaded and breaking in upon the Property of a Nation as well as of particular Persons in the said Commerce  If I say these things are evident and that we know they are such as the Nation of  Great Britain  will not sit down satisfied with or as we may justly say cannot but resent and that with the utmost Indignation and that the said Enemy must know they would be so resented we must conclude them likewise in earnest to quarrel with the People of  Great Britain  and to begin a War  It has not therefore been insignificant in Order to convince the People of  Great Britain  of the stated and settled Resolutions of the said  Spaniards  and  Imperialists  to insult and affront his Majesty and to bring about a War in  Europe  for the carrying those Designs and Resolutions on I say it has not been insignificant to those Ends that Methods have been taken to expose the private and as I may call them Clandestine Methods of the said Confederating Powers for the encouraging Treason and Rebellion among the King's Subjects for animating disaffected Parties and for forming unjustifiable Schemes of Trade such as must necessarily end in War and Confusion  To prove that the Enemy resolve to bring the Allies to a Necessity of making War in their own Defence is to prove that a War will necessarily be the Consequence and in such Case if the  Spaniards  resolve to prompt that Necessity 'tis the  Spaniards  make the War not the Confederates  To put things upon us which it is not reasonable we shou'd bear which no Nation in their Senses can bear and which they may depend upon his Majesty will not bear or his Allies either is indeed to begin the War or at least to declare the War to be inevitable  It was not therefore so remote from the Question in hand to say we shou'd go to the King of  Spain  and to the Emperor and ask them whether we shall have  War  or  Peace  it is for them to answer that Question and their Actions have indeed determin'd it already they have made the War a thing not only Certain but as I say Inevitable nay they have begun the War by a secret clandestine Conduct full of Machinery full of Secret and yet Evident Acts of Hostility and by carrying on such Mines and subterranean Attacks against the  Hanover  Allies as they might easily know and be sure those Allies would not bear and such as indeed they ought not to expect wou'd be born with  In a Word all the Conduct of the  Hanover  Allies has been Pacific Healing and visibly endeavouring to heal and make  up the Breaches which have appear'd and to preserve a good Understanding between the Powers of  Europe  on the other hand all the Conduct of the Enemy has been menacing provoking and insulting Clouds big with Thunder tho' empty of Force  Brutum fulmen  Noise without a Bolt Threats without a Hand to execute pointing but not pointed In a Word They have breathed War on every Occasion that if possible they might make it necessary to the Allies to begin it  It seems they have 'till this time been able to do little more than Urge and Provoke using all the Methods possible to show their ill Will except that of Force which tho' they have been unable to make much use of they have shown evidently that they intend all that is or shall be in their Power to injure and offend the  Hanover  Allies and his  Britannick  Majesty in particular that so a War may follow of Course  Not but that this Consequence may happen much sooner than they will find for their Advantage and before they may be thoroughly ready for it yet it might be very needful to ask upon what particular Foundation they who are in reality so ill able to carry it on seem so very hasty for bringing it to pass Whether they have not met with some Disappointments since they begun thus to show themselves and whether those Disappointments ever made any visible Alterations in their Schemes or no  That they have met with some Disappointments is evident and that in several Articles Nothing is more certain than that they had a View of several things which in their Embrio appear'd probable and encouraging which they have since found Reason to conclude will not answer their End and the Deficiency of which renders their Designs far less promising and hopeful than at first For Example    'Tis evident  they had Hopes of obtaining some tolerable Conditions for the Preserving the  EastIndia  Trade that is to say for upholding the  EastIndia  Company erected at  Ostend  by which Commerce the Imperial Court depended upon it a large Revenue would accrue to the Publick as does by the like Company to the Governments in  England    Holland  and  France    'Tis Evident  they hoped for a mutual Assistance and Communication between the united Powers of  Vienna  and  Madrid  the one assisting the other with Money and the other reciprocally supplying Powerful Bodies of Troops to carry on an offensive War The Imperial Court I doubt not depended upon vast Supplies of Money in Specie at least all the stipulated Sums which were very great by which Money the Imperial Armies great and numerous already wou'd be still made  greater and more powerful and the War be carry'd on into the Dominions of the  Hanover  Allies to great Advantage    'Tis Evident  they hoped to bring off  France  from its Attachment to the Interest of the Allies of  Hanover  and particularly from its warm Adherence to all such farther Measures as might embarrass the said Courts of  Spain  and  Vienna  in a War with  France  believing perhaps that at the worst  France  would not have come into an offensive Alliance against  Spain  and have turn'd its Arms against a Branch of the House of  Bourben  in which also we doubt not they are happily disappointed  It is evident  Spain  is particularly under a most mortifying Disappointment in the  British  Squadron blocking up their PlateFleet at  PortoBelo  and stopping the Returns of those immense Sums of Money which should have been brought to  Europe  by the Galeons and the  Flota  which had they come safe had as they tell us brought them at one time forty Millions of Pieces of Eight in Specie which with the Merchandizes loaded on board those Ships at the same time amounted to above Ten Millions Sterling which immense Sum tho' much the greater Part of it was the Property of their own Subjects and of the Subjects of the Allies as Merchants yet perhaps the King of  Spain  might have thought fit at such a Juncture as that of a War to have borrowed some of or otherwise to have appropriated it to the publick Uses for the maintaining the Engagements mentioned above perhaps however making Satisfaction to the Proprietors by some other way▪  I may name several other Heads of Disappointment in the first Views which the  Spaniards  had of these things in their Order and which had they foreseen they would perhaps have acted something more warily than they have done and so have given less Umbrage to the Allies or at least stopp'd their Hands 'till they had gotten the Money upon which all the Rest so much depended into their Hands  But I must note as I go that here they have been overshot in their own Bow Here the Allies have been too old for them And now it seems they are going on without their Crutches walking without their Legs and in a word making the War without the Money I return to the Disappointments  It is evident besides all this that the  Spaniards  met with a very great Disappointment in the  Baltick  where we are pretty well assured they promised themselves great Assistance and from whence we are told they expected a Supply of Naval Strength which Supply they found as effectually lock'd up in the Port of  Revel  as they did the Money that was to pay for it in the Haven of  PortoBelo  The  Muscovites  could no more part with their Ships or cause a Squadron of Men of War to sail without Money than the  Imperialists  could cause their Armies to march without the same Supply and if they the  Spaniards  expected it otherwise if they expected fifteen Sail of  Russian  Men of War would come to their Assistance without Money they were much mistaken and acted more like F  s than the  Spaniards  generally used to do  Nor is it less wonderful to me that the  Spaniards  who used to act in former Days with such consummate Wisdom and by such impenetrable Councils that it was said of  Don Lewis de Haro  he obey'd the Scripture in his Politicks whatever he did in his Alms and that he did not  let his right Hand know  what  his left Hand did  that these very wary circumspect  Spaniards  should let so much of their secret Service come to light and act in such an unwary and impolitick Manner as to have their Measures be talk'd publickly of in the ordinary Conversation at  Petersburgh  as I have been inform'd has been the Case  Nothing can excuse the Folly of it in my Opinion unless I shall with some People suggest that the Improbability of their Schemes and Chimeras being Successful should argue they were not at all in earnest about them But this has so much of the  Jacobite  in it and so little of the Politician that I think 'tis scarce worth repeating 'tis much more certain that the locking up the  Muscovite  Fleet was an inexpressible Disappointment to the  Spaniards  and that it could not have been if their Expectations of Help from that  Russian  Fleet had not been very great  It is true under all these Disappointments and more which I shall speak of presently it might have been expected the  Spaniards  and the  Imperialists  notwithstanding their Confederacy should have laid aside the Design it self and should have carried on the Project no farther and indeed this gave Occasion to my calling the Design in general absurd and ridiculous supposing the  Spaniards  could not be so weak as to go on with it and that if they were in Earnest before they could not be so now  But since it is so that the  Spaniards  or the  Imperialists  think themselves still able to carry on their Designs and that they are not sufficiently discourag'd by their Disappointments let us then turn the Tables as they do and talk seriously of it as a thing really intended And here as I said before tho' the  Spaniards  are not so Considerable as to fright us I hope we may allow that they are not so Inconsiderable as not to awaken  us They are certainly strong enough to justifie our Preparations tho' not so strong as to fill us with Apprehensions  Hence all the Precautions which have been made use of by our Government and by his Majesty's particular Direction have been not justified only but are to be esteem'd as Effects of the most wise and successful Councils imaginable a Prudence that has had something more than common in it and which has been the Foundation of all those happy Disappointments to the Enemy  Happy Disappointments  I say to us Unhappy enough to them and which at this time may be said to compleat the History of the Conduct and Success of the  Vienna Alliance  These Precautions and Provisions at the same time that they have disappointed the Executions of the  Spaniards  Design have also made the carrying it on farther absurd and foolish have really turn'd the Tables upon the Enemy and made their toowellconcerted Schemes become ridiculous the Measures which as first proposed among themselves appear'd rational and probable agreeable to a wise and prudent Nation and to the Counsel of able Statesmen and Ministers are by these Means become scandalously vain and imprudent and we may bless the Precaution I say at the same time that we make a Jest of the  Spaniards  Obstinacy in carrying on these Designs after they were so render'd ridiculous  To justifie this Argument let us return to the first Scheme let us examine the first Prospects upon which they were form'd the Foundation upon which the  Spaniards  and the House of  Austria  united and upon which the Treaty of  Vienna  was made and in doing this we shall not perhaps find the  Spaniards  such weak People as they seem to be now We shall find that 'tis rather their obstinate persisting in their Pursuit of a blasted Undertaking that renders them ridiculous than any Absurdity or incongruous Acting in the first Scheme or in the Foundation those Schemes were built upon  Had the  Spaniards  close in their Councils and prudent in their Conduct kept their Affairs within the Compass of their own Cabinet as they formerly used to do and secured the Secret in their own Breasts Had they been so far the Masters of their own Schemes as to have secur'd the Supports and Supplies they wanted so that they could neither have been kept from a Squadron by blocking up  Revel  or from the Galeons by blocking up  PortoBelo    Had they first receiv'd the Support of fifteen Men of War which is said to be the Number they expected from the  Czarina    and the Supply of forty Millions of Pieces of Eight from  PortoBelo  had they brought in the King of  Sardinia  and the King of  Sweden  and the King of  Poland  and the King of  and several other Princes and Powers into the  Vienna  Treaty as I make no doubt they at first expected and as they indeed at first reported  Had they brought his most Christian Majesty and the  StatesGeneral  to a Neutrality as they say they have obtain'd of the King of  Portugal  and the Duke of  Lorrain  and as I doubt not they earnestly endeavour'd with the two first  In a word had all these Points been gain'd and had they met with none of the other Disappointments already mention'd I most readily grant they had form'd a Body of Power truly terrible and formidable to the Protestant Interest and we had had more Reason much more Reason to be alarm'd and indeed frighted with the Apprehensions of what might have been the Consequence of these things than I hope we have had yet or are like to have now  Not but even with all those I should still say and hope it would appear that the Naval Strength of  Great Britain  might under Providence have been our Protection against them all  But they have been disappointed in almost every Part Even the  Venetians  themselves tho' a State under infinite Obligations to the House of  Austria  and to the Crown of  Spain  ever since the Battel of  Lepanto  yet so ill have they manag'd that we do not find they have been able to bring that wise People to espouse their Cause or so much as to promise a Neutrality or to act as Auxiliars by Land or by Sea  This Consideration however may serve to give us the useful Reflection mention'd above  viz  How Just have been the Cautions and how Prudent have been the Measures taken on this Side be it by who you will to dive into these Secrets to detect these Contrivances and which is still more how Successful happily Successful the Discovery How many Ways has it been advantageous and particularly how useful in having given time for the Preparations of the  Hanover  Allies nay for the forming the Treaty it self and in having opened the Eyes of other Powers and bringing Them into it who seem'd doubtful whether they should accede or no  Again Of what Use has the preventing those things been to us that from such a formidable Appearance from such a deeplaid Design that was capable of being made thus terrible they should be brought to so despicable and truly concontemptible  a Figure that 'tis hardly reasonable to talk of them at the same Time or hardly think of them in the same Class or under the same Rank  Had not his Majesty's penetrating Councils evidently reach'd to the Bottom of all their Designs gotten the Knowledge of their Schemes and div'd into the Depth of all their most considerable Projects None of all these preventive Measures had been taken none of these preventive Medicines had been made use of the several mischievous Things which they had concluded on had not been calmly countermin'd and unhing'd or the Contrivers of them been so effectually detected and disappointed as now they are  I am far therefore from saying or suggesting that the Designs and Schemes of those Powers had not been capable of great Attempts that the Naval Power of  Spain  and  Muscovy  join'd might not have been sufficient to have brought the Pretender upon the Stage in some Part or other or at least to have given him some Expectations and have put him and his easily deluded Party in hopes of great things to be done for him that Way Or that the numerous Armies of the  Muscovites  and the King of  Spain  united with such Allies too as are mentioned might not have been able to have given us great Uneasiness and to have even endanger'd the Safety of all the Protestant Interests of  Europe  as well as of these united Kingdoms of  Great Britain  As then I grant the Danger to have been  thus Great  had they gone on uninterrupted I must allow also that the Discovery having been thus happy it behoves us to keep the Hold that is gain'd to preserve the Advantages of the Discovery to keep the separated Powers in the same state of Separation to keep up the engag'd Powers to their Engagements and by all lawful means to preserve the Consederacy of the several Nations that are thus confederated to cultivate the Union that they are now brought to and if possible to encrease it This I think is the only way to preserve our Religion and Liberties our Superiority of Power and also our Commerce in the Condition it stands in at this Time  Heav'ns be prais'd the Snare is laid open the Enchantment is broken the Plot for the cementing the Powers proposed is discovered No Application can be too Great no Charge or Expence ought to be spar'd to keep it where it is and therefore all that his Majesty has recommended to the Two Houses of Parliament for their engaging themselves vigorously in their own Defence is of sufficient Weight on that Side Nor can any one object that the utmost Application ought not to be used to render all those Attempts  as Abortive as I think they are now become Ridiculous  To do this the proper Steps are taken indeed the Money is lock'd up and the Ships are lock'd in the  Spaniards  are disappointed and nothing remains but so to double and redouble the same Efforts as to make those Lockingsup more effectual and to take from the King of  Spain  all Hopes of removing those Obstructions  I am told while these Sheets were writing that I write too much with an Air of Contempt when I mention the  Spanish  Affairs as if a Squadron of Ships at  PortoBelo  could effectually stop the whole Channel of Silver and that not a Ship could escape us that nothing could pass from  America  to old  Spain  without our Leave and that we are as sure of intercepting all the Ships that shall stir out as if we had them in Tow  But the Objector is mistaken I no where suggest that the King of  Spain  shall be able to bring no Money home that we shall stop it all so that nothing shall go by us But I may venture to say the  British  Squadrons if well posted and if the Commanders do their Duty will so narrowly watch the  Spaniards  that they must run great Hazards if they attempt to come away with any great Quantity and that such Hazards as I am perswaded the  Spaniards  will not think fit to venture their Treasure upon it  Perhaps it may not be possible so effectually to shut up all the Ports which the  Spaniards  possess on the Coast of  America  or so effectually to ply  off  and  on  upon all the Coast of Old  Spain  as that no Ship not one Ship shall be able to slip out on the one hand or find its way in on the other without falling into our Hands or into some of the Hands of those that would be willing to snap and lay hold on them and I could fruitfully employ some Pages here to show how and which way such things might probably be done and might more probably be prevented  But as in the first place our Governors do not seem to want Directions for the preventing it so on the other hand I am not  Spaniards  enough to show the Enemy if they stood in more need of it than they do how to defeat the Measures taken by  Great Britain  to meet with and surprise them  But to go on I may grant that it is not probable the Confederate Fleets or Squadrons however Vigilant or how diligently soever they may guard the Coast and spread the Seas either on one side or the other should ever be able to surprise the  Spaniards  so effectually that not one Ship should be able to come safe in  The Sea is a wide Place and it must be very well spread to secure every Ship and lie upon every Point of the Compass so that nothing should be able to go by We see here that notwithstanding Admiral  Hosier  's Squadron on the Coast of the  Isthmus  and notwithstanding Admiral  Hopson  is cruising off of the Southward  Cape  yet Fame tells us that three or four Ships have found their way into the Ports of  Spain  and coming by such different Courses as they have done it is not at all strange that they should It is true we are told they bring no Silver at least none that we know of and had they been all deeply loaden with Silver it might have been the same thing and no Body to blame neither  On the other hand we must have exceeding bad Luck indeed and such as we have no reason to expect considering the Numbers of our Ships and the Vigilance and expert Knowledge of our Seamen if they shou'd go all safe and none of them shou'd fall into our Hands in which Case I must add that the  Spaniards  Treasure comes in such good round Lumps and such merry Sums together that if it shou'd be but  now and then  that a Galeon shou'd fall into our Hands it would make the Fortune of the War go smilingly forward on our Side a few such Prizes might make good a Summer's Service and help the Government to carry on the War  How often do we find the Loading of but one Ship amount to four five or six Millions of Pieces of Eight and if we shou'd chance to make such a Ship or two find their way up to  Woolwich  in a Year or to' deliver her Loading at  Towerwharf  it would go a great way towards carrying on the War and would be a much better way of raising Money than four Shillings in the Pound upon Land  This very Consideration will no doubt exceedingly weigh with the  Spaniards  in that particular Case  viz  as to venturing out with their Silver I mean not the Loss only to themselves tho' that would be very considerable and the Discouragement and Damage to them in case of such a Loss is not easily describ'd But the Encouragement it wou'd be to their Enemies The Loss to themselves would be inexpressibly great especially as they have no other Source of Wealth no other Fund of Treasure all the Produce of their own Dominions is able to do little for them compar'd to this and if either the Galeons are kept entirely back or shou'd miscarry in coming forward and fall into the Hands of the  Hanover  Allies we may without affronting the  Spaniards  say they will be but in a sorry Condition to carry on the War and to support their newbought Friends  But that is not all The Triumph of their Enemies over them shou'd the Money fall into the Hands of the  Hanover  Allies would be infinitely a greater Mortification to  Spain  as well to their Pride as their Power than the Loss of the Money for this wou'd be enabling the said Allies to carry on a War against  Spain  at the  Spaniards  Expence and this I make no question they shall do though they shou'd not take the Treasure at Sea at all But of that by it self  In the mean time we need not fear but we shall catch some by the way though it may not come all to Hand As I said above we must have very bad Luck indeed if none of their Ships fall in our way and if any are taken they are generally worth bringing home  The Probability of this is one of the Reasons on which it has been so openly said that  England  may Gain by a War with  France  but never Loses by a War with  Spain  of which we shall have room to say more from a particular Enquiry into our  English  History where unless upon taking a  Spanish Flota  a  Vigo  Account shou'd be given of it  viz  where much shou'd be lost and but little gain'd we might find large Sums have been brought into  England  taken from the  Spaniards  on all Occasions of a War as particularly at the taking of  Cadiz  by the  English  and  Dutch  when it was said that besides the publick Gain upon redeeming the City and other Articles all the Officers and Soldiers got not enough only but enough to make them rich But of this again in its Place  In the mean time though the Prizes we might take should be but few yet 'tis not unlikely we may have some Share of Booty in such a War as well private as publick such as may amount to another Disappointment to  Spain  and that such a Disappointment as  Spain  will not easily recover and of which they may have time enough to repent And this brings me most naturally to the chief Design of this Work  viz  the Advantages  Spain  is likely to make of this War which they are so forward to engage in or to speak plain the Advantages the  Hanover  Allies are likely to make of it In our Enquiry after which it may be determin'd by the most ordinary Judgment whether I have pass'd a wrong Censure in saying that the Conduct of the  Spaniards  is absurd and ridiculous or no  CHAP II  Of the Advantages which offer by this War to the  Hanover  Allies and to  Great Britain  in particular as they relate to the Trade of the  Spanish WestIndies  THE Necessity of a War has been spoken to The Conduct of our Enemies however ridiculous as well as the Conduct of  Great Britain  however deliberate concur to make that Necessity evident  Let the  Spaniards  go on  as the Clarks say to a Prisoner who they know will be hang'd  God send them a good Deliverance  How backward have the  Hanover  Allies been to quarrel How have they been so far from seeking Occasions that they have even refus'd to take Occasion when offer'd  How reluctant have the  British  Court been in drawing the Sword how willing to prevent the feeble Enemy from blust'ring with theirs  What Pacific Measures have they all along pursu'd what Opportunities of offending have they pass'd over nay what needful Defendings have they seem'd to omit Let us see a little into the Nature of all these things  Whether has the Backwardness of the Allies to a War been occasion'd by their Fear of the formidable Power of the Enemy or Has it been from a full Persuasion that the Enemy having no Advantages in view from the War could not be in earnest in all or in any thing they have said or done about it  or at least would remain so but a very little while    As nothing they have said about War has been rational so nothing they have done towards a War hitherto seems to have been founded in Reason  No Man fights meerly because he Hates but because he Hopes Defensive War is entred into by Force and Necessity but it is too with Hopes of being able to defend able to repell the Force they fear  But Offensive War is founded on a firm Belief of Victory and Hope of Conquest it can stand upon no other Bottom and therefore in old Times entring into War was usually call'd an Act  of Faith  rather than  of Hope  being an Opinion nay a Confidence of Success either trusting  in Heaven  for it from the Justice of the Cause or in themselves from the Strength of their Arms  But here's a War to be undertaken with neither Faith in Heaven or Hope on Earth Neither a View of Defending or Hope of Offending How the Heroes of  Spain  will come off with the Credit of their Understanding That we see nothing of  Time must discover it  Since then we cannot see any Gain the  Spaniards  can make of the War nor any Loss we can sustain by it let us see what are like to be the Consequences of it one way or other If the  Spaniards  are not like to Gain let us enquire What they are like to Lose by it for War is a Game in which the Parties seldom draw Stakes they generally gain much or lose much Since the Allies cannot with any manner of Reason apprehend much Loss by the War let us see what Gain may be made by it  on their Side  The Learned in Politicks have an ancient Way of Talking as old as Queen  Elizabeth  about  England  's making War which with a little Amendment reads thus ENGLAND  may Gain by a War with  France  but never Loses by a War with  SPAIN  'Tis my stated Opinion speaking without National Prejudice that  England  is so far from being in Danger by a War with  Spain  that it would be no Loss to us if we never had any Peace with them and I believe we have much more to say for a continued War with  Spain  than the  Spaniards  have for a continued War with the  Turks  and  Moors  'Tis plain as the  Spaniards  themselves say they have carried on the War in  Africk  these Eighty Years past without Fighting and a Commerce these Hundred Years without Trading The  Moors  have indeed besieged  Ceuta  after their way for above Forty Years but the  Spaniards  say that by the Commissary's Account of Ammunition the Garrison of  Cadiz  have spent more Powder at the Puntals there in Salutes than the Garrison of  Ceuta  have spent in Defending themselves during all the Siege the late particular Expedition of the Marquis  de Lede  excepted which was but short  This Resolution of  Spain  never to enter into any Treaty with the  Moors  has been derived from one or both of these two following simple Causes A religious rigid Separation and fiery Zeal against  Paganism  and against  Mahomet  resolving that the true Catholick Church should have no Commerce no Peace no Communication with the Enemies of  Christ  the same futious Zeal which they have likewise carried on against the  Jews  Or and which I take to be the truer and more rational Account of it A haughty Insolence founded on the cruel Animosity of that War which for so  many Years was carried on against the  Moors  in  Spain  'till their utter Extirpation in which War they gave no Quarter took no Prisoners not would admit even the Remains of those People tho' willing to become their Subjects so much as to live among them  Unhappy Pride How many Nations as well as private People has it struck blind and cover'd their Eyes from their own Felicities The  Spaniards  could carry on no Trade in the World more to their own Advantage than that with the  Moors of Africa  and yet they won't trade with them either from a Civil Pride that they will only make Slaves of them or from a Religious Pride that they will not converse with Infidels  Trade knows no Religions no Sects no Parties no Divisions We may 'tis hoped be as zealous to hate God's Enemies as the  Spaniards  and yet we trade with the  Turks    Jews    Mahometans    Moors  or Pagan  Negroes  and deal with the Idolaters of  China  and  Malabar  as well as with the Native Savages and  Cannibals  of  Virginia  and the  Carribees  There's no Idolatry in Commerce if the  Spaniards  reject the gainful Trade of  Africa  on Pretence of Sanctity and Religion Is that a Religious Separation I say No 'Tis not because they are Wiser or Better but because they are  Spaniards  that is to say eaten up with Pride SelfOpinion and Haughtiness  That the  Spaniards  might trade with the  Moors  to great Advantage is evident in that the little Trade they have to  Africa  and which they may be said to have with the Place not with the People is very much to their Gain and would be much more so if they extended it as they might do But they trade with the  English  and  French  Merchants residing in  Africa  not with the  Moors  and rather buy the Goods they demand there at second and third Hand than take them directly of the  Moors  so they give away their Profit of the Trade to the  European  Nations to gratify the Aversion they have to the People  It is an undoubted Maxim in Trade  That we ought to Trade with every Nation and with every People that we can get Money by  This the  Spaniards  are so far from pursuing that they will not deal with the  Moors  even for the Things which in Commerce they may be said to be in Distress for only because they won't deal with them  In the utmost Distress which the  Spaniards  are sometimes in for want of Corn how do they chuse to send to  England  to  Holland  to the  Levant  or indeed any where for Corn  rather than to  Africa  rather than deal with the  Barbarians  tho' the  Barbary  Coast sometimes has a great Plenty and tho' they give two Dollars  per  Bushel for the Corn which they could buy there for  s  or thereabouts and sometimes for much less  In their rejecting now the Manufactures of  Europe  how easy would it be to supply themselves with a Quantity of Wool from  Barbary  which with a small Application would mix and work up with the  Spanish  Wool and make all the several Manufactures of  England  to Perfection and to the infinite Advantage of  Spain  it self But forsooth they must not Buy or Sell with the  Mahometans  and Enemies of Christ tho' Himself gave them a quite different Example accepting of a Draught of cold Water from the  Samaritan  with whom the  Jews    Spaniardlike  had no Dealings  But contrary to the Beneficent Humble and Gracious Example of Christ himself the proud  Spaniards  pretending Religion throw away their Commerce scorn the Blessings of an advantageous Trade and rather maintain a constant unreconciled National Feud a foolish faint and unactive War refusing to trade with the  Moors  and carrying on neither Peace or War  As this Case stands with  Spain  and the  Barbary  Shore the Former is infinitely to blame and may be said to act ridiculously because as above speaking in the Language of Merchants every Body should be Traded with that you can gain by No Nation willingly interrupt their own Commerce or refuse to let their Subjects trade with such other Nations as they can gain by For a Trading Nation to Prohibit the Importation of such Goods as they want is like Prohibiting the bringing in Corn in a Famine or Prohibiting Arms and Ammunition in a War When the War was hottest between  England  and  France  and the  French  King prohibited almost all the rest of our  English  Goods forbidding upon the severest Penalties the bringing any of those Goods into any Part of his Dominions it was observable however that they always excepted  Wool    Leather  and  Lead  these were never Prohibited the Reason was plain they had none or but very little of their own and very much wanted them all nor could they be supplyed at least not sufficiently from any other Place  Now the  Spaniards  act by none of these Prudentials for they refuse to Trade with the  Moors  or Merchants of  Africa  though they might gain very considerably by it The  Africans  have Corn Copper Wax Wool all which the  Spaniards  extremely want and yet will not buy because forsooth they  don't like the  Moors  worshipping  Mahomet  as if Religion had any thing to do with Commerce and as if the Bread made of  African  Corn would infect their People with Idolatry  Now I alledge and insist upon it That in a constant State of War between  England  and  Spain  the Case would be quite otherwise for here would be War without Prohibition as in their Management with the  Moors  they have Prohibition without War I explain my self thus  As we Trade with  Spain  the State of Things lies so much to the Advantage of  Spain  that tho' the most violent War that it is possible to imagine was to be carried on between the Nations the  Spaniards  that is to say the Merchants would endeavour with the utmost Art to carry on the Trade notwithstanding the strictest Prohibitions The Reason is plain  They would Trade because they gain by the Trade the Trade to  GreatBritain  takes off the Growth and Produce which they are ruin'd if they do not Sell and supplies them with Necessaries which they are ruin'd if they cannot Buy In a word they have no Commerce without us their whole Export is stagnated their Fruits their Wines and their Oyl would rot upon the Trees and not be worth gathering their Lands lye uncultivated and no Hands be employ'd the Poor would starve and the Rich be beggar'd and undone In short we buy nothing of  Spain  but what we can very well be without and the  Spaniards  take nothing of us but what they extremely want  On the other Hand take the Alternative in the Commerce what the  English  buy in  Spain  as it is the Growth and Produce of the Country 'tis essential to the  Spaniards  to have those Goods taken off their Hands and by the  English  too in particular the Reason is because if the  English  do not take them off no other Nation can do it  For Example    The Growth and Product of  Spain  consists so far as it regards Trade of Wines that is to say  Sherry    Alicant    Tent    MountainMalaga    Galitia  and  Viana  Reds  Barcelona  and  Bene Carlo  Reds and  Canary  Whites  Barcelonian  Brandy  c  also Fruits such as  Malaga  and  Alicant  Raisins Oranges Limons Almonds besides  Spanish  Wool  Spanish  Iron and lastly Oil and Soap  These Things being the Growth of  Spain  the  English  buy in very great Quantities if they are not bought off  Spain  as to the Trade of it is ruin'd and undone whereas if  England  bought none of those Goods from  Spain  they could either  do without them for neither Wine or Brandy or Raisins or Oranges or Lemons are so necessary to Life or to Trade as that we cannot as to the most of them live without them or as to Trade have them somewhere else  So that upon the whole there is no absolute Necessity on our Side to have the Growth of  Spain  but there is a Necessity on the Side of  Spain  to be Traded with so as to have their Goods taken off  It is true the taking off the  British  Manufacture by the  Spaniards  is very much the Advantage of  Great Britain  but all that is Advantageous is not Necessary We are able to subsist in Trade without the Profits of our Manufactures better than the  Spaniards  are able to subsist in Life without the Use of them Nor is that all for let the King of  Spain  pass what Negatives and Prohibitions he pleases the Necessity of those Manufactures will make their own Way and the People must wear them or wear nothing at all for they have no equivalent Manufacture to place in the room of them and if they have them not from  England  they will have them from  Portugal  from  Italy  or from other Places as has been the Case in all the Wars which have happened between  England  and  Spain  in which Commerce has been Prohibited  But the Weight does not lye in this Part The  Spaniards  may Prohibit Trade with  England  when they please they will punish themselves infinitely more than  England  But take the Trade of  America  into the Consideration and truly there let the  Spaniards  have a Care what they do Let them take heed lest instead of Prohibiting their People Trading with us that is with  England  I say let them take heed that we  England  do not Prohibit their Trade with one another and among themselves  By Prohibiting the Trade among themselves and with one another I mean for it requires Explanation that it is in the Power of  England  in consequence of this War and by the Means of it entirely to Interrupt nay to Stop the Commerce between  America  and  Old Spain  And thus I am come to my Text namely to enquire into what the Allies may gain by this War How it may be carried on by the  English  or  British  Nation in such a Manner as that Old  Spain  should never more have any Commerce with  America  that is to say not  Exclusively  that they should no more call it their own Trade but the  Spaniards  in  America  shall be entirely set free as to Trade shall be Independent of Old  Spain  receive no Laws or Limitations from them but be at full Liberty to Trade with all the World if they please or if we please rather  for it would be meet to insist upon some Limitation on our Side too  Nor do I concern the Civil Government of  New Spain  in any Part of this Provision  England  or  GreatBritain  seeks no Conquests all they covet is to establish Peace and extend Trade and this we seem to have fairly before us in the approaching War If the  Spaniards  cannot see the Fate that attends them in it as it seems to me they do not they must go on and venture the Consequences the thing is plain to me they run the Hazard of losing all the Sovereignty of their Trade in  America  by a War  They may keep the Sovereignty of the Country if they please or if they can that is if the Natives will submit to it but they would soon have no Commerce to it no Communication with it other than in common with the rest of  Europe  This I say  England  will have it in their Power to limit and restrain that is it shall be in the Power of  England  to take off all the Restraints and Limitations of Trade which the  Spaniards  have imposed and do now impose upon the  Americans  and upon their own People there and lay the Trade open to the whole World holding the Hands of the  Spanish  Government so that they should have no Power to impose any Terms of Commerce upon them in  America  any more  This is explaining my self fully as to the General Head of Commerce and as that Commerce is now Stated by the  Spanish  Government between their Colonies in  America  and Old  Spain  or indeed all the rest of  Europe  It is observable that the State of the Trade between Old and New  Spain  stands thus The  Spaniards  having Planted  Mexico  and  Peru  and all the vast Country between in the Nature of a Colony conquered or extirpated the Natives and taken Possession of the Country as their own in consequence of this Right they give Laws of Commerce to the Inhabitants as well Natives as  Spaniards  settled there these Laws like our Act of Navigation are made up briefly thus  viz  That the  Spanish  Colonies in  America  should drive no Trade or in any manner Correspond or Negotiate with any Nation of  Europe  Directly or Indirectly but by the Licentiate or Allowance of the  Consulade  at  Seville  that is to say the Chamber of the  Contractration  at  Seville  and by their Order and in such  Spanish  Ships and no other as shall be Licensed in the same  Consulade  or Council of Trade which by the way is call'd a Royal  Council of Commerce  and so it is the License of the King  This  Council of Commerce  not only limits what Ships shall go out but the Persons who shall be allowed to go over in those Ships and all the Cargoes or Quantities of Goods that they shall carry with them and the Returns made for them which are all Registred in their Books They have also other particular Powers and Limitations which the  Spanish  Trade is bound to submit to but I am now upon Generals only I shall come farther into the Particulars presently  As  America  is to Old  Spain  what we properly call a conquer'd Country so they even the  Spaniards  that are settled there are Govern'd in an Arbitrary Way as a conquered Nation and that notwithstanding their being Subjects of Old  Spain  Under the weight of this Arbitrary Government they submit to this among the rest That no Ships are allowed to come into any of their Ports from any Place in the World except from Old  Spain  or by  Assiento  from Old  Spain  as above or some Place or other limited in the first Establishment of Old  Spain  that is to say from  Guinea  or any Part of the Coast of  Africa  they may come loaden by the said  Assiento  with  Negroes  and with them only  From the  Canary  Islands they may go so far as the  Havana  carrying no other Goods but Wines and Pipestaves the Growth of that Island and even of that the Quantity is limited as well as the Ships  Thus the whole  Spanish  Interest is brought under one Head of Universal Commerce and is call'd the Trade of New  Spain  or  America  and is strictly confined limited and restrained to Old  Spain  in particular as is mentioned above and the  Spaniards  in  America  and the  Spaniards  in Old  Spain  or New  Spain  have no Commerce or Liberty of Commerce one with another but by the License of their Government  Now there remains a Question or two fit for the Government of Old  Spain  to answer rather than an  English  Author but which if they cannot answer to their own Satisfaction it will be yet harder for them to answer another Grand Question which follows it The first Questions are  Are the People of New  Spain  whether Natives that is  Indians  or natural  Spaniards  compleatly easy and satisfied with those Limitations And would they not shake them off if it lay in their Power  Are the Government and People of Old  Spain  able to keep fast those Bolts and Bars by which the Trade is limited and prevent the People of New  Spain  trading with the  Europeans  in case of a War  Then the Grand Question follows  viz  How are the  Spaniards  sure that if the Inhabitants of  America  shall at any time come into a free Trade with  Europe  by the Means of a War they will ever be brought to quit that Commerce again having tasted the Sweets of it especially if they in Old  Spain  cannot force them to it  These Questions rightly inquir'd into will let the  Spaniards  see if their Eyes are not closed upon what precarious Terms and Conditions their Tenure of the  American  Trade stands and how soon they may irrecoverably lose it if they put the Powers of  Europe  upon a Necessity of Humbling their Insolence by a War I shall speak more particularly to it in its Place  CHAP III  The State of the  Spanish  Trade in  America  How tho' it is the Property of  Spain  yet it depends upon the Justice and Friendship of the rest of the Powers of  Europe  How those Powers if they think fit to withdraw that Friendship or are provok'd to do themselves Justice upon the  Spaniards  in  Europe  are able to lay open the Trade to New  Spain  at one Blow and never suffer it to return to its former Channel  IN almost all the Treaties which the  Spaniards  have made with the rest of the Powers of  Europe  whether Treaties of Peace or of Commerce they have always from a Sense of their own Weakness in this particular Case taken care to Guarrantee their  American  Commerce by Negative Clauses wherein the said Nations and Powers have generally consented Not to Interfere in the said Trade that is to say Not to suffer or at least not to authorize their Subjects to carry on any Trade immediately to New  Spain  contenting themselves with carrying on the said Commerce or such Share of it as their Subjects respectively carried on in the ordinary Channel and that the  Spaniards  should enjoy the said Trade in Property as their own  It is needless to look back to the several Clauses in the Treaties with  Spain  and other Nations for the Confirmation of this Article 'tis enough that it is particularly Stipulated in  the several Treaties between  England  and  Spain  and confirm'd by subsequent Treaties since that of Which I mention here not to enquire how well those Treaties have been observ'd either on one Side or other tho' it may not be improper to speak of that also in its Place but I mention it here I say to let it be seen how sensible  Spain  has always been of its own Weakness and Inability to preserve that Commerce notwithstanding all the Right they may claim to it without the voluntary Consent of the  European  Powers stipulating to yield and give it up as above  It is not thus with our Possessions in  America  the  English  and even the  French  also have indeed the same exclusive Right to the sole Trade of their own Colonies in  America  as the  Spaniards  claim to these of New  Spain  and they have Laws likewise respectively enacted such as the Act of Navigation in particular binding their Subjects to such particular Restraints and Limitations of Commerce as are proper to secure the Property and Sovereignty of those Trades to the respective Powers whose Subjects they are  But the  English  and  French  secure in their own Strength and always believing themselves able to support and defend their own Right have trusted to that Strength for their Defence not at all seeking the Guarantee or Protection of any other Powers for the Security of their Trade  The first Inference I draw from these Premises is that a War breaking out supposing that Part to be certain and especially the  Spaniards  becoming Aggressors and beginning that War the Powers with whom such a War is begun are then evidently discharg'd from all the former Obligations of those Treaties their Subjects become from that Moment free from all the stipulated Engagements and Restraints relating to that Trade our Ships may then as freely trade to the Ports of New  Spain  as they may to any other Part of the World I mean freely with respect to any Restraint to be laid upon them from their own Respective Sovereigns as to the  Spaniards  they must do as well as they can if their Ships of War attack our Merchants that's allowed to be but fair and we must bear it as well as we can but if their People will come off to our Ships or Sloops and buy or sell that can be no Breach on our Side for the War is begun already and all Obligations to limit that Commerce ceases  The Argument is Short and to the Purpose the  Spaniards  may indeed punish their own  American  Subjects as they please and treat them as Traytors for entring into this Commerce as it is contraband and prohibited by their own Laws which Laws are binding to their own Subjects  But the Allies are by vertue of the War mutually declar'd against  Spain  and by  Spain  against them effectually and  ipso Facto  discharg'd from all Limitations of former Treaties forbidding this Commerce And I take the more Notice of it because 'tis to be hoped the said Allies especially the Powers of  Great Britain  and the  StatesGeneral  will consider very well of it at any subsequent Treaty before they consent again to limit their own Subjects from a Commerce which is so many ways advantageous to them  What Reason have trading Nations to tye themselves down to the arbitrary Laws of Commerce which the  Spaniards  may think fit tyrannically to impose upon their own People 'Tis enough that they refuse to admit any of the Protestant Nations of  Europe  so much as to set foot among them much less to trade and live among them a Liberty which we no where deny to the  Spaniards  I say 'tis enough to be thus excluded from residing among them but if their own People  at whatever Hazard  are content to trade with us I cannot see why we should pay so much Veneration to their Government and their Arbitrary Laws as to tye down the Merchants from a fair Correspondence and Commerce together  Let Trade take its Course let Exchange of Goods and Money take its due Course and be uninterrupted on all Sides let the  Spaniards  and the Ally'd Powers come to a good Understanding as soon as our Government pleases let them fight and agree as his Majesty thinks fit let the Merchants be at Liberty to extend the  British  Commerce with their utmost Skill this need be no Interruption to a Peace for what has the peaceable Merchant to do with War and Government  It is a strange fit of religious Strictness which the  Spaniards  think good to practise by the Power of their  right bloody  Inquisition  viz  that they will suffer no Strangers whatsoever unless  Roman  Catholicks so much as to set a foot in New  Spain  much less to live among them and if any  Englishman  or  Dutchman  attempt to live among them if they are discover'd they are condemned to the Mines and must go to work at  Potest  Nay so cruel are they and so unmerciful that if an  English  Ship should come upon their Coast in the greatest Distress whether in Distress by Storm and so wanting perhaps Masts or Sails Anchors or Cable or Carpenters or in Distress for Provisions and are wanting Freshwater Bread and other Provisions in none of these Extremities will they as I have been inform'd give them Relief tho' they are by express Treaties oblig'd to do it A Piece of Inhumanity which  I do not find the  Turks  or  Pagans  are arriv'd to in any of the known Parts of the World  But these Catholick Christians on the other hand will even in these Cases of Distress which all other Christian Nations consider use all possible Stratagems to get the Ship into their Hands in which case the Cargo and Ship is consiscated and the poor Men tho' no way offending are perhaps made Slaves and sent to the Mines without Redemption Which by the way not to say any thing of the particular Cruelty with which the  Spaniards  treat their Slaves and which few of them are able to survive many Years is a degree beyond what is practis'd either at  Algier  or  Salle    Tunis  or  Tripoli  or by any the  Moors  of the  Barbary  Coast  I need go no farther for the Proof of these Things than the Authentick Relations of those of our own Country who have been upon the Spot and who have partly suffered under those Barbarities and partly been Eyewitnesses to the Sufferings of others and to the particular Method by which the  Spaniards  render themselves so odious to the rest of the Christian World for Cruelty and Injustice  That no Nation but the  Spaniards  at least no Christian or  Mohometan  Nation that I have read of do this but the  Spaniards  I think I may appeal for the Proof of to the general Practice of the  English    Dutch  and  French  in like Cases and in the same Country  It is true that neither of these Nations permit any other Nations to trade in their respective Colonies Reasons of Trade the Interests of Nations and the Property of Commerce demands it that it should be so that the Trade of the particular Colony may be reserv'd carefully separately and distinctly to the Use and Benefit of the respective Nation to which it of Right belongs  But in any of the said Colonies if a Ship belonging to another Nation is manifestly driven into the Port or Harbour by stress of Weather or is in Distress for Freshwater or Provisions the Government will allow them Shelter and will allow them to take Freshwater and purchase Provisions for their Voyage and this notwithstanding the strictest Prohibitions of Commerece according to the express ScriptureLaw  If thine Enemy be hungry give him Bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him Water to drink  Prov xxv For all Ships of another Nation are in the Language of Trade and in the Sense of those Laws of Navigation  a kind of Enemy  as to Commerce I mean tho' otherwise in full Amity and even if they were in Confederacy it would be the same  It is true if the Ship so distress'd shall transgress the Law and break in upon the Hospitality which they meet with and shall clandestinely and privately offer to trade with the Inhabitants shall  break Bulk  as they call it and sell any Part of her Cargo other than shall be allow'd by the Government of the Place for the Payment of such Provisions as they are allow'd to buy in such case they are liable to be stopp'd feiz'd upon and the whole Ship and Goods confiscated and this is no Wrong done to them because they are the Offenders and know beforehand the Consequence of such a Trespass if it was discover'd  Yet even in this Case tho' the Ship and Goods are confiscated yet the poor Men are not made Slaves on the contrary they are let go and may shift for themselves and are oftentimes reliev'd and treated with Humanity as may be prov'd by very many Examples even upon the  Spaniards  themselves  Again If a  Spaniard  or a Boat full of  Spaniards  should come to any of the  English  or  French  Colonies and land there  so be it  that they offer to bring no Goods to land there against the Constitution of the Commerce mention'd above they are admitted to come on Shore may land and go freely up and down take themselves a Lodging may trade as Merchants or dwell as Strangers submitting only to all the particular Laws of Commerce which other People submit to nor will they meet with any Molestation or Obstruction while on the contrary the bare coming on Shore among the  Spaniards  in any of their  American  Colonies is Death or perpetual Slavery which as the  Spaniards  order it is worse than Death For without injuring the  Spaniards  as they are but indifferent Servants when Servitude is their Lot so they are the worst Masters in the World at least among either Christians or  Turks    This then being the State of the  Spanish  Colonies and of the Commerce and it being as is said conceded to by the  European  Nations by sundry Treaties of Peace and Commerce hence it follows that if any of the Subjects of the said  European  Nations tempted by the extraordinary Gain of a private Commerce with the  Spaniards  do either lie  off  and  on  as they call it upon the Coast with Sloops and Ships and so trade in the Night with the  Spanish Perioguas  and  Canoes  which come off to them as the  English  of  Jamaica  and the  Dutch  of  Curacao  frequently do or do land in the Bay of  Campeache  and cut Logwood as the  English  from  Jamaica  and  NewEngland  have always done or trade by Force upon  the Coast of  Chili  and  Peru  as the  French  have done since their late License during the Time of War  If I say in these Cases the  Spaniards  happen to fall upon them and take them burn or sink their Ships and use the Men after their usual  Spanish  Severity tho' it be too inhumane even to mention yet the several Nations to which they belong do not usually make this any Matter of Complaint or reclaim the Ships or Men as if injuriously taken the Trade it self being contraband an Example of which we have lately had in some  Dutch  Ships taken on the Coast of  Chartagena  and  Saint Martha  or thereabouts by the  Spanish  Cruizers who they call  Garde de Costa's  or Guardships  Not but that those  Carde de Costa's  as the  Spaniards  call them commit several Depredations and almost Pyracies in taking Ships which are not Traders or trading and this the  English  complain of at this Time and that I believe with good Cause But that by the way  In General it is true that this Right of an exclusive Commerce as it was at first assum'd by the  Spaniards  as a Property so it is conceded to them by the Assent of their Neighbour Nations and agreed to by Treaty the very obtaining of which Treaty is a tacit Acknowledgment that they are not able to maintain the exclusive Commerce by their own Power nor able either to restrain their own People or keep the Ships of other Nations from their Coast and this is the Reason of my entring thus far into the Case of the Limitations of the Commerce which otherwise would not be to the purpose in the Case before me  But to bring it down directly to the Case in hand With a War in which War as it is evident the  Spaniards  themselves are Aggressors all these Limitations and Reserves of Commerce cease at once the Trade is laid open and it is fair working not only to break in upon their Trade by all such Methods as we find practicable but to make such Gaps and Openings in it as it shall never be in the Power of the  Spaniards  to close and make up again no not by a Treaty of Peace  Thus the  Spaniards  who in Breach of those very Treaties by which their exclusive Trade was conceded to them have unjustly attempted to open the Trade to a Nation expresly shut out may find themselves left naked of the just Defence which those former Treaties always were to them and so may never be able to recover the exclusive Commerce of the  Spanish WestIndies  which has been of such infinite Advantage to their whole Nation or to call the Trade their Own any more  Nor would it be any Injustice to the  Spaniards  especially as I say they are the Aggressors in this War for if during the past Ages those  European  Nations now ally'd against  Spain  were less opulent and less powerful in Trade and which is above all the rest were less united in Interests trading Interests I mean than they may be now and were perhaps willing to keep Measures with the  Spaniards  which might in some things be to their Disadvantage rather than to let them be laid too low or perhaps rather than another shou'd reap the separate Advantage of it as was the Case in the late War when  France  obtain'd an Admission into the Trade to the  Spanish America  I say tho' in those Times these Concessions might be made to the  Spaniards  and their Pretensions to an exclusive Trade were so far confirm'd it may not be always so  If this has been the Case it was the  Spaniards  Business to have preserved the Advantages which that divided Situation of the Affairs and Interests of  Europe  gave them and to have cultivated that Friendship which alone was the Safety of their Commerce and not by such precipitate Councils as these to open the Door of that Commerce to a People no way in condition to carry it on or to protect the  Spaniards  in it and pretend I might say foolishly pretend to shut those out who are able to let themselves in and even to dispossess  Spain  it self not of the Trade only but of the very Country too whenever they please  These are the Advantages which I mean when I speak of the Probable Consequences of this War and this is that which I call going to the Bottom of things A full Enquiry into which will open the Eyes of  Europe  and let us see farther perhaps than ever before whether I have wrong'd the  Spaniards  in saying they know not what they are doing that their Measures are absurd and ridiculous in a Word if I had said they were mad that is to say their Ministers and Managers whoever they are I say if I had concluded them mad or next door to it it had been in my Opinion the kindest thing I could have said of them  To have said they had taken these Steps with their Eyes open with their Reason in its full Exercise with their Politicks free from Distraction must have been to have suggested worse things of them than I am willing to charge them with and to have intimated that they were a Set of Men in a Plot or Conspiracy to betray their Master and ruin their Country  But be it which of the two you please it seems to me that  Spain  may have an Occasion to look back with some Reproach  upon its late Politicks in Leaguing with a Prince so very lately their Enemy and so ill able to be their Friend against two Powers  GreatBritain  and  France  so very able to ruin them and which should have been the two last Nations in the World that  Spain  ought to have differ'd with and out of which Quarrel they will not find it so easy to deliver themselves as perhaps they imagine that is to say without deep Wounds in their Constitution especially as to Trade And this is what I meant when I said as the Clerks  Culprit  do to the Prisoner who they know will be cast upon his Tryal  God send you a good Deliverance  intimating at the same time that 'tis not at all likely  CHAP IV  Of the Condition of the  Spaniards  and their Colonies in the  WestIndies  and the Manner how this War may be carried on to the Advantage of

their Own and mutually Guarrantee the Property of all their Subjects  Contrary to the meaner Principles upon which Princes too often make War the King fights not for Fame He is placed by Heaven on a Seat above all the empty Things we foolishly call Glory and were my Business  Panegyrick  or my Design  Flattery  what could I not say here to exalt the happy Prospect of his Majesty's present Undertaking  Even the King himself cannot look upon it without lifting up some Thoughts to Heaven and blessing the Power that has singled his Majesty out to act in a Scene of so much superior Glory superior to all the Kings of the Earth as it affimulates the Deity and represents a King acting by immediate Commission from his Maker and in a perfect Harmony with his Providence  As Thunders dissipate the noxious Air  And raging Storms the sequent Calms prepare  So Nations by his Pow'r restrain'd from Feud  Are to their  own Felicity  subdu'd  With awful Voice be calls at every Door  And warns their Monarchs not to  ronze  his Pow'r  His Sword half  drawn  makes their Commotions cease  He Frowns  to Smile  and he contends  for Peace  His Rebels crush'd are  under Conquest  free  And only  are confin'd  to Liberty  This seems then to be the State of the approaching War  GreatBritain  acts the Part of the World's Protector The King linking the Nations in a strong Confederacy opposes the aggressing Disturbers with such an early and superior Hand that they find themselves disabled in the very Infancy of their Undertaking  The  Spaniards  obstinate and opiniatre beginning at the wrong End of their Work break out into a War with so little Prospect of Success that the World looks on with Surprize to see them act so as their Friends can have no Hope and their Enemies no Fear from the Event of the Undertaking  A Town impregnable even by its Situation and made more so by the Addition of terrible Fortifications open to the Sea and their Enemies Masters of the Bay able to relieve it as often as they please What strange unaccountable Beginnings are these  Spain  ought to remember their Ancestors ill Conduct at the Siege of  Ostend  which on the single Article of its being easily reliev'd by Sea  held out a Siege  of  three Years and four Months and cost the  Spaniards  Men to conquer whereas being not to be reliev'd by Sea the late Duke of  Marlborough  took it in twelve Days  This Town with all the Advantages of Situation and Fortification has in it a numerous Garrison of old Veteran Soldiers commanded by experienc'd Officers furnished with all things needful for a vigorous Defence and covered with a strong Squadron of twelve large capital Men of War such as no twenty Ships that the King of  Spain  may get together will dare to engage  To attack this Place the  Spaniards  whole Infantry are about at the most who if I may speak without boasting are no more able to attack the Town to any purpose than twenty Men would be to take the Tower of  London  If the King of  Spain  fails in this Enterprize 'tis very likely he ruins the Infantry who are before it and tho' his Kingdoms are indeed very large yet we all know that it is not the easiest thing in the World to raise a new Army in  Spain  'tis not like  Germany  which as one says travelling thro' it is an inexhaustible Storehouse for Men and those Men all born Soldiers  But in  Spain  it is quite a different Case not but that the  Spaniards  are very good Troops when well paid well cloath'd disciplin'd and led abroad from Home but  Spain  is more fruitful of any thing than Men there are so many go abroad and so very few stay at home so many turn Priests and must not fight are poor dejected and cannot fight or are  Lazy Dons  among the Gentry and will not fight that it is the hardest thing in the World to raise an Army in  Spain  at least with Expedition  Thus stands their Affair at home and in this unhappy Posture they are beginning the War a Posture that I think they are the first People that ever began a War in before  As soon as they strike a Stroke at  Gibraltar  they ought to expect all the Allies to declare against and fall upon them  France  in the first Place we may suppose will be expected upon their Frontiers with two Armies one in  Navarr  and the other in  Rousillion  and in that Figure we shall soon see how they will go on  Let us now take a View of the Situation of their Affairs as to Trade and particularly as to that Part of their Commerce of which I have spoken so much  viz  the Trade of New  Spain  While the  British  Squadron remains on the Coasts of  America  suppose in the Gulph of  Mexico  or upon the Coasts of  PortoBelo  and  Carthagena  either the  Spaniards  must fight that Fleet or otherwise remove it or there's an end put to their Commerce on that Side all at once  It is objected that a  British  Squadron may indeed interrupt the Commerce in this or that particular Place but that this will not effectually ruin the  Spanish  Trade The Coast of  America  as possess'd by the  Spaniards  is a large Place 'tis extended in a vast Length from the Gulph of  Florida  or the Northmost Part of the Gulph of  Mexico  and in the Latitude of to Degrees to the Coast of  Surinam  and even to the Month of the Gulph of  Paria  and the lsle of  Trinidado  and farther to the Latitude of five Degrees So that here is a Length of Miles or thereabouts in a Line North and South besides reckoning the Depth of the Bay and the Indentings of the Coast of  Yacatan  the Bay of  Campeachy  the Gulph of  Honduras    Darien  and others which make the Coast above Miles in Length of all which I shall speak again in the next Chapter  In the mean time to give the Objection its utmost Stress they add that the Heat of the Climate the Unhealthiness of the particular Places where the Station of such Ships must be and the want of Provisions are such as that no  European  Fleet can bear to be constantly station'd in those Seas  That as well at  La Vera Cruz  as at  PortoBelo  which are the two Centres of the  Spanish  Commerce the Air is so unhealthy by reason of the excessive Heats that even the  Spaniards  themselves cannot dwell there and only come at the particular times of Trade when the Ships from Old  Spain  arrive when they buy their Goods deliver their Money finish their Dispatches and Letters to  Europe  and return again the former to the great City of  Mexico  and the latter to  Panama  and thence to  Lima  and the other Ports on the Coast of  Peru  and  Chili  in the  SouthSeas  That this is evident at this time for that the Galeons being as it were besieged or block'd up by the  English  Squadron their Men presently grow sickly and dye apace nor perhaps are the Men in the Squadron it self quite free tho' being better furnish'd with Provisions than the  Spaniards    for the Country yields little or nothing thereabouts  I say the  British  Sailors being better furnished and better taken care of and better fed the Men are by consequence better able to bear the Inconvenience of the Season yet the Place is allowed to be such as admits no long Stay  map of Porto Belo  Porto Belo  That the  Scots  in their Settlement at  Darien  which is but a little South from  PortoBelo  found by sad Experience that there was no bearing the Situation tho' the  Scots  are as hardy a People and as able to bear the Extremities of Weather as most Nations in  Europe  I am the more willing to give the utmost Length to these seeming Objections because when they shall be fully and unanswerably removed they will leave the less to say by a Set of People who deal in Misrepresentations and Discouragements as a particular Traffick of their own and calculated for a particular Cause which wanting some Cordials knows not where to find or make any better  It is true the Coast of  America  as now possess'd by the  Spaniards  is exceeding large as is described and that the great Gulph of  Mexico  is not to be block'd up by a Squadron of Ships the several Ports for Trade being so remote one from another and that in the whole the Coast may lie extended above Miles  It is likewise true that the Ports of  La Vera Cruz  and  Porto Belo  which are at present the Centre of the  Spanish  Commerce in those Parts are unhealthy dangerous Climates the Shores destitute of Provisions the Heats excessive airless and not refresh'd with Land Breezes as in other Places and that even the  Spaniards  themselves are not able to bear the Extreams of the intemperate Seasons such as the Summer's Heat and the Winter's Rain especially about  Porto Belo  But the Mistake of all this lies in the Ignorance of those that lay the Stress of this Cause upon the posting an  English  Navy or Squadron only for the Interrupting this Commerce whereas there is nothing more plain than that the Ally'd Powers are able at once not only to Interrupt the  Spanish  Commerce but to put an entire End to it and in a Word break off all settled Correspondence between the two Countries I mean of Old  Spain  and New  Spain  and this without hazarding their Ships or Men to lye upon an unwholesome Coast and poison themselves with the stagnate Air of  Darien  or the  Bastimentos  Not but that on this Occasion the Galeons being in the Port it became necessary to post a Squadron as Admiral  Hosier  has been posted to stagnate the Money as well as give the  Spaniards  a Taste of the stagnate Vapours of the Place and to keep them where they were If they are ill furnish'd with Provisions if the Country cannot supply them if the Stores in their Ships are not sufficient for them they are at home they must take care of themselves no doubt but by  LandCarriage or by the great Lake of  Nicaragua  which runs eighty Leagues within the Land and reaches within fifteen Leagues of the  SouthSea  they may be sufficiently furnished with Provisions at least may have some Relief in their present Exigence for it is very well known that the Country of  Guatimala  bordering on that great Lake is the most fruitful pleasant and plentiful of any Part of  Spanish America  or else their own Accounts of it are very false and they have described it much more to their own Advantage than they can make out when they find occasion to make use of it  But if it should be so that they are distress'd for Provisions as I say above  they are at Home  they are under no Restraints they have no Enemies landed upon them they may send for Provisions where they are to be had and may send Expresses to the Governours of the several Countries to supply them and to find Means to convey them Certainly the Governours will not suffer the King of  Spain  's Ships to want Victualing or suffer the poor Seamen to starve upon their own Coasts and as may be said at their own Doors  But we are not speaking of an Advantage to  Great Britain  only in this present depending Article of Blocking up the  Spanish  Galeons which is a thing of today and as we may say will be over tomorrow is done to serve a particular Occasion and will serve that Occasion most effectually for we see how ill able the  Spaniards  are to bear the Disappointment and what a Check it gives to their Enterprizes how low their Credit runs in  Europe  and how even their Auxiliaries and Confederates as it were stand still 'till they see from what other Springs the promis'd Streams of Money will flow  The Occasion therefore is abundantly served by the  British  A'dmiral posting his Squadron at the Entrance of the Harbour of  Porto Belo  and hindering the Galeons from coming out spreading the Sea with his Cruisers and interrupting their Commerce and in a Word locking up their Money so as that tho' it be in their own Possession it is yet out of their Reach and rendered at least for the present as useless to them as if it was in the Mines at  Potost  And tho' it is far from being mention'd as any part of the Advantages hinted at in my Title and which are offer'd to the Allies in the present War any farther than it is an Accident to the Beginning and a particular Circumstance which falls in to the Encouragement of our Friends and the great Disappointment of the Enemy yet it must be acknowledged too  that it is a very great Advantage in its Kind and it shows the World that the  Spaniards  with all the Funds of their immense Treasure which it may be said they are Masters of beyond all the Nations of  Europe  yet are so unhappily situated that they must as it were be oblig'd to ask their Neighbours leave to bring it home and dare not venture abroad with it if but nine or ten Men of War appear upon their Coasts  But notwithstanding all this and supposing this Expedition of  PortoBelo  were to be reckon'd as nothing in the present Account of the Advantages of the War it is manifest that their whole  WestIndia  Commerce is in the Hands and at the Mercy of the Allies in this War that we are able to put an End to it at once if we think fit and that not for the present only but for the time to come whenever the Government thinks fit to enter into Measures for that Purpose  And not to pretend to lead our Leaders or to direct them in whose Direction the whole Government is already so wisely steer'd I may venture to lay before you the Schemes of former Times and make some small Inferences from them which if our Governours please to make any Use of they may doubtless very much improve and if they do not think fit to make use of they will 'tis hoped not be displeas'd at any welldesigning Subject however injuriously misrepresented mentioning such things for their Service as are apparently capable of answering the End if accepted and can be Hurtful to none if rejected  Nor can it be said that it is a discovering the Weakness of the Enemy to themselves and putting them upon securing themselves where they lie open since the Enemy are far from being ignorant of the Disadvantage they lie under they are not so insensible of the weak Part and have been sensible of it many Years ago but find there is no Possibility of preventing the Consequences but by being Masters at Sea which is an Article that never was but once their Chance and is never likely to happen to them again at least it will not in this War whatever it may do in Aftertimes  If some things offer in  this War  which have not offer'd before at least not to be so practicable in any former War and if wiser Heads than mine have not yet seen them or rather not look'd into them so much as perhaps they may see reason to do hereafter I hope it will be no Offence to give any Lights however unworthy and illesteem'd the Person who so officiously offers them for the publick Service and however sinking under the Weight of unjust Calumny his Opinion may be slighted yet he may boldly say his Reasons  shall not be confuted nor any Scheme he lays down be justly objected against by the most envious either on one Side or other As to their being made use of or not made use of that is an Affair by it self and which at present it becomes him to say nothing about unless it is made his Duty  CHAP V  Of the particular Advantages the present Prospect of a War offers to the  British  Nation with respect to the Commerce of the  Spanish WestIndies  OLIVER CROMWELL whatever other things may be said of him and how ill soever his Name may sound at the Head of any Affair as a Precedent yet was certainly no Fool He was no more void of Counsel than of Courage I do not find that his Enemies even of those Times ever gave it as a part of his Character that he was either a  Fool  or a  Coward  In consequence of his Usurpation and while the Administration might be said to be in his Hands among all the Foreign Nations whom he differ'd with he declar'd War against the  Spaniards  The Reasons and Occasion of the War are known History is full of them and I have no room for Quotations the Reading World know where to look for them  In that War  France  was a Confederate  as now  and their Forces in Conjunction with the  England  took  Dunkirk  but  Oliver  who was not us'd to give up any thing he could keep took care also to have that important Conquest put into his own Hands and lest it to the  Englash  Government at his Decease leaving the  French  to make the best of the War for themselves in remoter Parts How the  English  kept it  publish it not in Gath    But  Oliver  willing to touch the  Spaniards  in a more sensible Manner and in Consequence of the Experience of former Ages observing that by attacking  Spain  in the  WestIndies  he should not only wound that Monarchy in the tenderest Part of its Government but carry on the War in that Part of the World where most was to be gotten by it turn'd his Eye towards  America  In calling up this short piece of History I desire my Readers to keep their Eyes strictly upon the exact Parallel of Times and Circumstances leaving the Persons quite out of the Question and to stand and fall as their Fate has long ago directed and let it be  Oliver  or  Oliver's Master  theit matters not here as the great  Andrew Marvel  said of him  Tho' his Government did a Tyrant resemble  He made  England  Great and her Enemies Tremble  His Measures at Home are nothing to me nor much indeed to any of us now they are over Heaven suffer'd him to overturn things and then Heaven overturn'd things again and having visited the Nation for their Crimes visited their Afflictors afterwards scourg'd the Scourgers and restor'd the Government Just as in ancient Times he delivered up his People to the  Assyrian  and then restor'd his People again and destroyed their Destroyers  But I am talking not of  Oliver  's Conduct at home or his Measures with his Governours but his Measures with the  Spaniards  and with them only  It was about the Year when the War with  Spain  continuing after several other Attempts the Council of War received some Proposals laid before them by the Government's Order for an Expedition to the  Spanish WestIndies  and as I had it not from History but by a very Authentick tho' Verbal Relation from a Member of the very Council of War to whom it was referr'd a Descent was propos'd to be made upon the Continent of New  Spain  This was in order to seize some Strength there keep the Possession of it fortifie and place a Garrison in it to be defended afterwards against all the Power of the  Spaniards  so by that means to extend themselves Gradually into the Country plant and cultivate still fortifying as they should go on 'till at length they might establish a Colony there and so share with the  Spaniards  the Possession of  America  and perhaps lying between the two great Empires which the  Spaniards  possess  viz  North and South  America  or as in particular they may be call'd  Mexico  and  Peru  cut off the Communication and possess the Shores of both Seas that is to say the Ports of  Nombre de Dios  which is much the same as  Porto Belo  and  Panama  By this Proposal it was suppos'd a Door would be immediately open'd to a Commerce with the  Spaniards  in  America  that a Trade would be carried on to infinite Advantage a vast Expence of the Woollen Manufacture follow and a return in Specie  be immediately and directly made to  England  without trading about by old  Spain  and under the Limitations and Restrictions of the  Spaniards  as it always was before and that in particular while the War continued very great Sums would frequently fall into the Hands of the  English  by keeping a certain Number of Ships of War always cruising in those Seas and having the Port of such Place as should be conquer'd to retreat into refit revictual and shelter themselves upon all Occasions  The Offer was specious the Adventure bold and the Success promising But upon farther and mature Deliberation tho' the Enterprise was accepted and undertaken in the General yet the Measures were chang'd the Place expected to be attack'd was rejected and a new Scheme as some said of his own was appointed for the Expendition and that was to attack the  Havana  the principal Port and the chief Strength of the  Spaniards  in  America  at least it was and is still a Place of the greatest Importance to the  Spaniards  of any in all their  American  Dominions as shall appear presently The Reasons given for this Alteration of Counsels were such as presently made an Impression upon All that were consulted about it and the new Undertaking was unauimously resolv'd on  In order to carry on an Enterprise of such Importance a Fleet and an Army was prepar'd and that with all the Expedition and Secrecy that such a Design call'd for Nor 'till the Troops were ready to Embark was it so much as guess'd at whither they were design'd  However the jealous  Spaniards  made afraid from the meer Importance of the Place rather than by any certain Knowledge of the Design sent away some Ships of War with Stores of Ammunition and Supply of Troops for the Garrisons of the  Havana  and of  Chartagena  as the two most significant Places they possess'd in all their  American  Dominions at least on that Side and these Ships arriv'd before the  English  some considerable time  The Design was at last made known only to amuse the  Spaniards    Carthagena  was given out as the Place intended to be attack'd The Squauron sail'd the Troops about or Men and commanded by the fam'd Colonels  Penn  and  Venables  The History of the Voyage is but short in it self and I shall make it shorter still the Design upon the  Havana  miscarry'd principally by the Disagreement in Councils among the Officers they were mistaken in every thing landed in a wrong  map of Havana  The Port and Bay of Havana  Place  viz  at  Hispaniola  the Men were harrass'd and fatigued and the  Spaniards  by that encourag'd they were repuls'd in two or three Places and at length they gave over the Enterprise laying the Blame one upon another reciprocally as in all humane Disappointments 'tis very frequent to do  Failing in this Enterprize they reimbark'd their Troops and tho' the Army had suffer'd some Loss Abundance of Men dead besides those kill'd and hurt in Action which was too many and the rest very sickly the General very unavailing to come home emptyhanded and undertake nothing worthy an  English  Army resolved to attempt the Island of  Jamaica  Accordingly they sail'd directly to the Place entred the Port landed the Army and being made wise by their Misfortunes and resolving not to be beaten unless cut in pieces they went on with more united Councils and a better Agreement than before by which means and the  Spaniards  being not well provided for their Defence they took the Island and to shorten the Story  Jamaica  has been  English  ever since  It is not to be wondred at if the  Spaniards  after this narrow Escape went to work with the Fortifications of the  Havana  and made it very strong adding a strong Castle at the North Part of the Town it self and adding several Batteries at the Entrance whereof one under the Castle  El Morro  has a particular Battery of twelve exceeding long Brass Cannon which they call the Twelve Apostles and which carry if the  Spaniards  may be believ'd a fiftysix Pound Ball  Since this and even while they were alarm'd with the coming of a  French  Squadron into those Seas in the late War under Monsieur  Pointy  when they took  Chartagena  the  Spaniards  apprehending the Design was against the  Havana  they caused the whole City to be accurately fortified and a Fort and a Cittadel to be rebuilt by which the Town as well as the Port has obtain'd the Name of a very strong Place tho' far from being what the  Spaniards  pretend to say of it Invincible But if it really were so at this time or if it was fivefold stronger than it is it is of no Value or Importance in the Scheme I am now to lay down nor shall it be of any Use to the  Spaniards  in the Case before me any more than the Strength of any other Place for what signifies its Strength when it is not to be attack'd  It is not the Fortifications upon the Shore that will Import any thing in this War the Superiority by Sea is the  thing we lay the whole Weight upon and being Masters of the Sea is that which the Sum of Affairs depends upon  However 'tis necessary a little to state the Importance of this Port of the  Havana  in as brief Terms as I can because this was the Reason why  Oliver  and his Council pitch'd upon it to make their Attack By the Import of it I mean the Import of it to the  Spaniards  as they are now possest of it and as it would have been to the  English  if  Oliver  's General had happen'd to take it  The  Havana  is the best Port without Dispute in all the  Spanish WestIndies  it is situate on the North Side of the Iste of  Cuba  opposite to the Gulph of  Florida  in the Latitude of twenty three Degrees North  The Gulph of  Florida  being the only practicable Outlet or Passage from the Gulph of  Mexico  by which all the  Spanish  Ships make their Return from  America  and by which they enter into Ocean which they therefore call  Disemboguing  I say the Gulph being the only Practicable Way all the  Galeons  from  PortoBelo  and the other Ships called the  Flota  from  La Vera Craz  come first to the  Havana  in their Passage home and there being in Safety from either Seas or Enemies for it is a Port as safe from Winds and Storms as from Enemies they wait 'till they meet from all Parts and as they call it make up their Fleet  N B There is another Way between  Cuba  and  Hispaniola  which the Seamen call the  Windward Passage  which the Ships from  Jamaica  sometimes venture thorough But 'tis hazardous and difficult and the  Spaniards  never make use of it especially with their Fleet  N B It should also have been observ'd that the Fleets from old  Spain  make this Port of the  Havana  be the first Place of their Arrival when they are outward bound and coming so far in a Body they then separate as their Orders direct the Ships for the South go away to  PortoBelo  and those to the West go to  La Vera Cruz  the Men of War attending them or not as they see Occasion and as Inteiligence of things directs  So that both ways whether out or home the  Havana  is the only Place of Safety where the Plate Fleet rendezvous and where they are cover'd from all Dangers nor wou'd the Voyage be easily made without such a  HalfwayPort  to stop in to recruit to take in Refreshments Provisious and especially Freshwater after so long a Run as it is from  Cadiz  thither in which they have no Place to touch at forRefreshment except it be the  CanaryIslands  where their Stay is but  very short the Road being not at all safe either from Wind or Weather or Enemies even the  Turkish  Rovers not excepted  Having thus given you a full Account of the Import of this Place to the  Spaniards  I have only this to add That in the propos'd Advantages to us for cutting off the  Spanish  Commerce and totally intercepting their Correspondence with one another which is the Scheme to be proposed This mighty Port this wellfortified City and this excellent Harbour shall be of no Signification or Importance one way or other it shall neither be worth any thing to us to take or to the  Spaniards  to keep Allowing  England  to have only the Superiority of naval Strength and to be Masters of the Sea which I think I may venture to say is not to be doubted and all the rest shall fall in of Course the  Havana  shall be as useless to the  Spaniards  as  Majorca  in the  Mediterranean  comparatively speaking nor shall it be able or the  Spaniards  by its help be able to prevent our Interrupting their Commerce and in short taking it wholly into our own Hands  The Case is Thus  There is on the same Island of  Cuba  and on the same NorthSide of it open to the same grand Passage of the Gulph of  Florida  another Port or Harbour call'd the Harbour or Gulph of  Honda  it is about nine Leagues to the Westward of the  Havana  and upon the very same Coast  The Conveniences of this Port among many others are some in particular which relate to the Subject in Hand  viz  That it is a convenient Place to form a Settlement upon and to fortifie so as with little Expence to make it unapproachable by Land and consequently not to be interrupted by the  Spaniards  That it commands a fruitful and plentiful and healthy Country where not only all manner of Provisions may be had but where such easy and secure Planting would follow as not  Jamaica  it self would go beyond it as well for Trade as supply of Inhabitants  But that which is above all the rest the Situation is such by Sea that not a Ship much less a Fleet of Ships can go in or out to or from the  Havana  from or to the Gulph of  Mexico  or the Coast of  Carthagena    PortoBelo  c but they must pass by this Port and even in sight of the Men of War riding here so that  England  has no more to do than to post a Squadron of Ships in this Port making it their Station and keeping some of them cruising upon the Coast of the  Terra Firma  as they see Occasion and let any one that understands the Situation of the  Spanish  Commerce tell us how they will carry it on without our Leave and which Way they will get out of the Gulph of  Mexico  or out of the Gulph of  Honduras  or to use their own Language how they will  Disembogus  that is get into the Ocean wihtout as I say asking us Leave  If this is their Case to make the just Inference from Things as I go will any Man say I was too arrogant in saying the  Spaniards  seemed  not to know what they were doing when they begin a Quarrel with  England  that their Proceedings were absurd and ridiculons and that they seemed to be little off from Distraction  The farther entering into this Scheme of Management for the interrupting the  Spanish  Commerce requires more Room than can be allowed to any thing from so mean a Pen But if any Writer or Writer's Master can raise one Objection against it that cannot with unanswerable Force be refuted I would be glad to see it  Let the greatest Friend to the  Spanish  Interest or the greatest Enemy to the Author of this tell me if they can which way the Flota's from  La Vera Cruz  shall get out into the Ocean which way the  Galeons  shall beat it up against a Leeward Tide as the Seamen call it from  PortoBelo  and not come under the command of this Port or that of  Jamaica  There is a Passage already mentioned which sometimes our Ships from  Jamaica  do make use of which is therefore called the  Windward Passage  and which runs from the East Point of  Jamaica  NorthWest and then fleering North goes between the Islands of  Cuba  and  Hispaniola  and passing among innumerable Islands Sands Shoals Rocks and other Dangers leaves the Gulph of  Florida  on the Larboard Side and goes out or disembogues into the Ocean to the NorthEast of all the  Bahama  Islands and it is true that the  Spaniards  may that is to say now and then a Ship may make their Escape this Way  But I refer it to the Judgment of the skilful Mariner whether this is a practicable Way for the whole Trade and if it were so whether then the Island of  Jamaica  which is already  British  would not be of the same use for that Course as the Bay of  Honda  would be for the other  I am no Projector nor am I laying the thing down as a Proposal at least not here but I think it is plain at least to me that a  British  Squadron posted in this Bay may when you please put an end to the  Spanish  Commerce in the  WestIndies  in such a manner that the  Spaniards  could never carry on any considerable Trade there again Always supposing what we have reason to hope will ever be the Case namely that the  British  Fleet shall be Masters of the Sea  It may be pretended that the  Spaniards  may coast along the South Side of that they call the  North Seas  that is to say under the North Share of the South  America  the Coast of  St Marta    Venezcula  or the  Carata's  and so to  Bosco del Drago  the Gulph of  Paria  and the Isle  De Trimidada  and so going away East get into the Ocean that way and come home with the  Portuguese  Fleets from the  Brasils  All this Eke what was said before of the  Windward Passage  is no more than like a City not entirely invested or that tho' besieged may have some such secret Passages as that now and then a single Messenger may escape in or out to carry a Letter or bring particular Intelligence but which signifies nothing at all towards its Relief much less towards raising the Stage and opening a Communication  Having thus stated the Case of the  Spaniards  in case of a War and on supposition of the  British  Superiority at Sea how their Commerce with  Europe  shall be interrupted and broken off and how they shall be no more able to trade no not with their own Subjects but by Leave from his  Britannick  Majesty and his Allies The Inference from hence is as natural and as plain as that mentioned above  viz  No Man need to ask what are our Advantages by a War with  Spain  I know some room lyes here for a Question thus Suppose you should thus Interrupt their Commerce what immediate Benefit or Advantage would that be to us seeing tho' they cannot trade so freely with one another they may hinder the Commerce of their own Subjects with the Subjects of others and so tho' the Interruption of the Trade be a Loss to them it will be no Gain to us  I State this Question not because it is a Question that any one who understands the Nature of the Commerce of New  Spain  will ask but because there are some People that will ask more Questions in half an Hour than  c  and because some are as  Solomon  says  Wiser in their own Conceit than those that can render a Reason  The Reasons to be given in answer to such Questions if any should be Weak enough to ask them are resolved into not Argument but Demonstration  If the  Spaniards  of New  Spain  cannot trade with the  Spaniards  of Old  Spain  Experience tells us they will trade with any Body If their own Ships cannot come at them to bring the Merchandize of  Europe  to them 'tis evident they must have those Merchandizes and they will seek to be supply'd with them where they can  The  Spaniards  themselves know this too well the Marquis  de Puzz  Bueno  in his late Memorial complains of this as one of the Effects of Admiral  Hosier  's Squadron lying at the  Bestimento's  viz that it covers and protects what he calls the Contraband Trade to the Prejudice of their Commerce  Let any one grant me that taking Post or Stationing a Squadron at the Bay of  Honda  shall command the Commerce of  Mexico  and  Peru  as I think it evidently appears it would I will answer for the  Spaniards  that they will grant it shall lay open their Trade Wholly to the Allies  The  Spaniards  in  America  rich and at case abound in Money and have Plenty of all manner of Provisions Wine excepted They have the most delicious Fruits they have a Profusion of Sugars for Preserving which they greatly delight in the finest Sweet meats and Confections in the World being to be had there in the greatest Plenty they have the  Cocoa  in such Plenty that their Chocolate which is their ordinary Repast costs them very little They have Flesh and Fowl and Fish in abundance infinitely more than they can consume And as for Money their Houses are fill'd with Plate and their Merchants Warehouses piled up to the Ceilings with Chests of Silver Coin  But with all this Affluence they have no Clothes they have neither Linnen or Woollen Silk or Hair of their own I mean manufactured and of their own making they have indeed some Cotton and some Wool and the  Indians  or Natives do in some remote Places make some ordinary things for their own Cloathing chiefly of Cotton and some course  peruvian  Wool  But the  Spaniards  like the  LordDanes  formerly in  England  from whole Pride and Laziness an Idle Fellow was afterwards call'd a  Lurdan  are too proud to stoop to any thing called Work so that they have no Merchandize and consequently no Cloth except what they receive from  Europe  and some  EastIndia  Goods such as Callicoes and wrought Silks of  China  from the  Philipine  Islands by the way of  Acapulco  This Supply of Manufactures is generally speaking the Loading of the Galeons including some Wines and Oyl and Fruit of the Growth of Old  Spain  and these Loadings chiefly consist of the Woollen Manufacture of  England  the Silks of  France  and  Italy  and the Linnen of  Holland  and  Germany  This Supply has sometimes been Interrupted by a War as was in particular the Case in the first War with  France  when the Galeons were stopped for two or three Years then it was the oddest thing in the World to see how shabby and ragged the  Spaniards  appeared with their Pockets full of Gold their Tables cover'd with Plate and their Warehouses as above heap'd up with Silver And the Author of this speaks of particular Knowledge that under one of these Disappointments a  Spanish  Merchant came on board a trading Sloop on the Coast of St  Martha  in a  Periagua  and bought as many Goods at several times as he paid Pieces of Eight for and had himself not a Pair of Stockings on his Legs and the rest of his Cloaths worn into such Rags as an  Englishman  with but  s  in the World would scorn to be seen in  He acknowledged that they had Money enough but no Cloths that every thing bore such a Price as tempted them that were Merchants to sell till they were almost naked He brought Pieces of Eight with him the first time and looking over the whole Ship's Cargo bought as much as came to the Sum abovemention'd stay'd in the Sloop all the next Day when they stood off to Sea to be out of Sight and went on Shore with his Goods the next Night returning again the Night after with more Money and so constantly 'till he had brought all his Money and then sent three other Merchants who bought all the rest of the Cargo  If this Trade was carry'd on thus when at the extremest Hazard what would it be when under the Protection of the Men of War the Ships and Sloops should come boldly to their Shores and the Buyers be under no Restraint Necessity obliging them to consive at one another on Shore and no  Guard de Costia's  to take Cognisance at Sea  Nay what would it be when the Bay of  Honda  should be a free Fair and that all the  Spanish  Vessels that thought fit to come thither should trade under the Protection of the Place and be safe going and coming under shelter of the cruising Men of War  Will any Man say that the Trade will not be wholly our own that is to say the Allies for the  Dutch  at  Curacao  and  Surinam  and the  French  at  Martinico  would have their Share in the same Commerce and any one may answer for it the Advantage would be such that we should never be concern'd tho' there was never to be any more Peace with the  Spaniards  either on this Side of the World or on the other  FINIS
