You merit neither the pangs you cost me nor the tenderness you receive from me I gave you a reason cogent enough to have weaned a  worthy  girl from a thousand Hammonds To that I might have added the sudden departure of a generous friend who I  now  tell you for I  can  hold no longer would have laid his fortune at your feet This indeed you must have seen since nothing but the most extreme stupidity could remain ignorant of those attentions which for many weeks past have been lavished upon you by Sir Robert Raymond a man oh inconsiderate who saved thy aged father in the very crisis of his misfortunes and too delicate to demand as a debt the tender returns of love which he would have sued for as a favour is gone almost brokenhearted away I had promised to  conceal  his confidence but you extort it from me nay you continue still to doat upon the wretch who is fighting against all the best and dearest connexions  of your family I will not endure it You assume the language of decision and call it the sentiment of reason You set yourself up as  judge and lift your woman's voice against the sacred principles of patriot and parent It is not to be borne Let me hear no more on the subject Cease your threats about daggers darts and death I look DOWN upon such romance Forbear to urge me You are not to learn the touches of my temper  My principles  are not less sacred than  your passion Your  principles What are they Airy nothings  Mine  are the solemn affections of a lover of his country and a detester of its oppressors a  detester of Henry Hammond  Why will  you drive me to this I know nothing of his wounds but if he has  received some  there is reason to suppose he has  given more  at least his bloody endeavours cannot have been wanting and every one is in the bosom of your father's native land Your affection is that of a girl whimpering after a boy Is this an affection to be brought in competition with that glorious fire which the love of liberty and an abhorrence as settled as it is sublime of rights usurped and saith broken Is your puerile yet headstrong inclination worthy to be brought into consideration with the passion that fills the breast and fires the soul of your afflicted and offended father  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CI  TO LOUISA CORBETT  THE characters of my pen will discover to you the condition of my heart Sickness sorrow distraction and despair are the apologies I have to offer for silence Do not grieve for the news you sent or rather that you sent me such news It inspires a thought whose influence chears me but I want health Oh that I could recoverthat I could gain but a little strength  Enough Writing will exhaust me I must nurse myself A new cause of sorrow too Sir Robert Raymond  hasGenerous man how I feel for him  Louisa adieu Pray for my recovery I conjure you I would use it to a worthy purpose I would apply it as every gift of God  ought  to be applied  Louisa farewell  EMMA  LETTER CII  TO EMMA CORBETT  THE news of the dayoh how shall I relate it The rebels as they are called have cut to pieces the greatest part of and yet this is mere newspaper report Henry perhaps may be amongst those who escaped the slaughter I cannot support these strokes I will enquire no more Let us hopeDespair would kill me  LOUISA CORBETT  LETTER CIII  TO LOUISA CORBETT  IT is sufficient Let our researches cease God Almighty bless my Louisa and her babe Heaven's pity and protection be upon them Emma bent on her knee offers this prayer to her Maker It is her legacy It is her last leave of love and sisterhood  Adieu Adieu Adieu  EMMA  LETTER CIV  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  O RAYMOND Raymond my oldest friend my truest companion pity ah pity the anguish of a fatherpity a parent whose persecutions have driven away his child Emma hath eloped Heaven knows where she has wandered Under pretence of visiting a friend near town she went in one of the public stages with intent as she said to return in the evening The friend whom she  pretended  to visit was Mrs Arnold of Richmond on whom she had often called in a neighbourly way I remained therefore perfectly unalarmed till twilight A  tempest of thunder and lightening happening about nine o'clock I sent over a servant to Mrs Arnold's imagining she might be afraid to come through it alone The servant returned from Mrs Arnold with news that Emma called there for a few minutes by way of morning ride but went away in a great hurry It was near midnight before I received these horrid tidings and then I ordered my horses to be harnessed and went at full speed to every house where the stages set up The people were all in bed and I obtained answers to my questions with difficulty None were satisfactory I traversed the streets in a distracted manner for oh you know how I doat upon Emma I  could not give the coachman any direction and he continued dragging me about but I bid him go any where rather than to my own house No traceno clueno glimmering of hope Hardhearted girl What though I urged her to forget the ungenerous Henry am not I her father But I will be calm I will cut her from my affections for ever I am just got home It is daybreak The servants are all dispersed to hunt after a runaway girl What a dreadful morning The hemisphere is in a blazeThe wind blows hardThe firmament opens its flaming breastI see into its bowels I am sitting all alone Oh my heart what a thunderclap was thereIt is now rolling  along the sphere Oh Emma Emma my daughtermy childmy darlingwhere where art thou Another WONDERWORKING GOD behold a contrite parent upon his knees lame and decrepid as he is to supplicate a covering for the beloved fugitive Perhaps Raymond our poor disconsolatethe mutual joy of our heartsperhaps some sudden stroke ofI dare not turn imagination that horrible way No no Emma is at last disobedient she is base she has abused her father she  Wherefore do not my servants return Villains how dare they sport with a sorrow like mine They know not what it is to be a parent  Alas I rave They have not been long gone from me and were they  already  to come back I should banish them from my presence for ever I know not what I would have I only know Oh Raymond that the universe cannot contain a more unhappy man than  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CV  TO C CORBETT ESQ  AS your letter arrived I was about to send to you an express I have heard from Emma Oh my friend you must arm yourself with fortitude The post brought me the  nclosed about an hour before dark Emma lives is recoveringfor the rest prepare yourself Prepare yourself to hear of fidelity heroism and resolution which claim admiration even from us whom they afflict whatever be their issue  I perceive that the present state of your mind my dear unhappy Corbett too much resembles my own for my  company to serve you Let us try the force of separate reflection  Read the letter of our beloved wanderer and tell me what is to be done  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CVI  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  The inclosure from Emma  SIR  I CLAIM the assistance of a man whom I know to be generous who honours me with his esteem and whom I venerate for the ancient friendship that has long united our families By the powerful force of  all  these feelings I conjure you on the receipt of this letter to visit my father Assure him that his dear dear image lives unimpaired in my heart Tell him that my absenting myself in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent but proceeds  from a motive most virtuous most irresistable most conscientiousfrom a duty that appeals to my heart my senses and my soul O let him not think that I  glory  in the necessity which takes me one moment from  him  I lament I weep I mourn over it I could wish that each duty went hand in hand and that some of their objects did not lie so wide apart from others Superior to every deceit I would have consulted my father even on the present measure but he will recollect the terror into which his late conversations threw me and will then be convinced how impossible it was to risque such an ecclaircissment Yet even now I will forbear to justify my departure  because I would suffer some reproach myself rather than try to establish an irregular example But the power who is giving me strength to sustain the great business I am about to undertake has placed in my bosom something which reconciles me to the enterprize Oh Sir Robert there is a duty which  must  be performedat least attempted Nature reason honour and faith the most hallowed all stir within me nay God himself at the marking of whose awful name I bow seems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approbation I may seem to be romantic when I mean only to shew myself sincere All sort of research will be vain I would not have yielded to  the least semblance of a scheme which is most terrible to my nature could it by any means have been avoided My father will call to mind certain sentiments and do me justice in his own dear bosom on this occasion  Sir Robert Raymond I ever desired to be uniform and to reconcile the distinct parts of my conduct with the whole Yet I will bear up against the charge of impropriety in this one instance for the sake of but further explanation is unnecessary Go then oh amiable mediator betwixt parent and childgo and plead my cause in all the eloquence of friendship Obtain for me  the paternal pardonsustain his heart and do not leave him a prey to sorrow  Excuse my forbearing to give you my address Pity the concealments which are thus imposed Be it sufficient that I will continue to send you accounts of myself at every opportunity  Oh farewell  EMMA CORBETT  LETTER CVII  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  YOUR letter Sir Robert with its dear and dreadful inclosure came to hand It is now before my eyes which are streaming in penitence for the phrenzy which has banished my daughter I now behold the whole matter too plain Oh my friend I treated the most dutiful of children with unwonted harshness and in the patriot I extinguished the parent I expected that a soul like Emma's should circumscribe itself within the pale of politics Curse on the rage of party Execrated be the tyranies of war Ah what are causes countries  worlds to the loss of one dear child adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett Blind doating zeal what hast thou to do with an old man's heart What with the sacred season of the silver hair Is mine an age to engage in these tumultuous subjects No I should have taken my darling daughter to my bosom and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fervently for the returning embrace of a divided people  That  would have been true patriotism and true philanthropy Instead of which dolt and dotard as I was I mixed with hotheaded giddiness in the affray I interested myself in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence and while I  talked of justice I was encouraging slaughter wholly forgetting or too bloodthirsty to remember that either army is composed of kindred and of countrymen Behold Raymond how I am punished But where where all this time is Emma No date No address A young creature unfriended alone of a delicate frame and harrassed by fatigue  Sick  also Never used to travel unattendedOh heaven But she will return The thought makes me easier Let me indulge it How tender will I be to herwith what fondness will I hang upon her neck and hide her blushes in my bosomhow will I talkhow soothehow console heroh I will  kiss her into confidence and composure I will even conversepardon me Sir Robert pardon the effusions of a repenting heartI will even converse upon her darling themeThe name of Henry shall be mentioned and if it does her good not without tenderness Alas what has the youth done butYes yes Emma will return She must She shall The slender and trembling thread of my being is sustained by no other hope  I have sent advertisements to the papers inviting her home describing person circumstances and situations but concealing names I have dispatched  various messengers to all the ports to have her tenderly intreated almost cordially  controuled  should her romantic naturefor oh I suspect she meditatesWas there ever any thing so wildBut she will never be able to carry it into execution and I will not even suppose it practicable She will return I shall recover the treasure of my age But the interim is anguishoh hasten my friend to soften it I am sick and Emma is not at my side I see her not at the harpsichordI hear not her enchanting voiceI contemplate not her lovely featuresall all the exact images of her dear motherher mother who would shudder in her grave were she  A servant enters to tell me there is nothing but her own little moneybox missing Her cloaths are all above stairs I dare not go to look at them I dare not open the door of her chamber It would certainly be my death  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CVIII  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  I AM not sorry you found it inconvenient to meet me Objects of gloom I know are intolerable to you Castleberry at present affords little else I used my friend to fly from these as assiduously as yourself Yet now they are become very dear I love the solitude which this scene affords me It was lately adorned by the society of Emma Ah elegant and hapless girl She has not only eloped but engaged me to justify the step she has taken to her father Oh Frederick her language is so sweet her power over me so resistless and her firm affection for this happy Hammond  this heroic rival so respectable that my whole soul yields implicit obedience to the very desires which involve me in despair What of things possible would I not do to secure to her but one moment's happiness Alas my friend sincerely as I know you love me I dare not tell you all that I intend to do Yet consider a young creature about to venture on the wild and uncertain ocean moved by a sacred impulse in favour of a worthy lover who has himself left a blooming mistress whose society he consents to sacrifice to his country Consider also this lover as one who is the choice of Emma and is every way suitable to her in person as in age  When you have maturely weighed these circumstances then tell me what at  my  age and under  my  circumstances I ought to do My friend no man knows what virtue or what energy there is in him till after the hour of serious exertion  There is a project Berkley rolling in my mind and if on a little more reflection I can reconcile it wholly to the dictate that uniformly sways me I shall undertake something that will excite your  ridicule  But for any thing of that kind I shall be prepared I have only two great powers to consult my reason and my conscience What they inspire can never be  laughed away Laugh then but do not forget that your mirth is at the expence of a friend who is seriously unhappy  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CIX  TO LOUISA CORBETT  PORTSMOUTH  I AM writing in a common publichouse at this town from whence in about half an hour I shall set off for America I am resolved to perform this voyage at all hazards Do not dear Louisa accuse me of wanting confidence because I did not acquaint you with my design I could never support the idea of involving a friend in the perils of a trust which may produce altercation in the issue When the soul is settled in its plan it is useless to ask advice and to enjoin secrecy in any family matter is generally  to embroil the person entrusted with some part of it or another  The haste and agitation in which I write is not to be expressed The house is crouded with sailors and their parting friends I am equipped with a proper disguise No matter what embarrassments I have had to procure or to put it on The wind does not allow me leisure for descriptions I am going as a cabbin passenger in a vessel called the  Henry  The very sound of the name affects me with a sweet superstition A boat is coming from the ship to take me on board and the captain is already here pouring brandy down his throat as if it were so much water I  sport  thus with circumstances to take all our grief away upon my account O my beloved sister for you see I am equal to the task The boatmen appear They tell me the gales are favourable The first view of the ocean is awful But it leads to Henry  Adieu The mariners are impatient They call me  fairweather  sailor which is a joke levelled purely at my complexion but they have no suspicion of Emma Oh farewell They hurry me I must fold up the letter I must bid you  indeed  adieu  EMMA  LETTER CX  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  FREDERICK I am now resolved Away selfish weaknessesaway all that is unbecoming the period of my life Come onward ye powers of more suitable attachment Come divinest image of graceful and honourable FRIENDSHIPcome and possess me wholly  Berkley I have made up my mind and it is easier My spirit settles I recover from the giddiness of passion and rise to more disinterested joys in which the appetites have no share  Adieu my friend I am preparing again for sea You guess my destination I follow the fortunes of the incomparable Emma in her tender pilgrimage o'er the waves There by this time floats the fair and faithful fugitive My servant is packing up Oh let me go catch the disconsolate Corbett by the hand and linger not another moment  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXI  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  YOU were scarce gone twenty minutes my most generous Raymond ere a letter came to hand by private conveyancea letter my friend whose contentsoh Sir Robert I sink under the double conflict of delight and of despair  Inexplicable Providence I have yet a son Edward still lives At this tumultuous moment I am dropping the father's tear upon the blessed paper that presents the news Oh for some few months of firmer health This unmitigable disorder which chains me to the chamber and the  chair Go then my friendgo most admirable most excellent fly to my children Ah that a parent's heartheaved sighs could speed your vessel on its way God give it swiftness Haply you may yet see and yet save my children  Oh if you should  forgetting all agony I have dropped involuntarily upon my knee to enforce the prayer  Oh if you should I conjure you to exert yourself Tell Emma I relent I yield to her pleading softnessI am no more the mad patriotI am henceforth all the parent Tell Edward  that I adore his virtue but tremble for his life Tell him enough of civil blood will be shed without swelling the current by any stream from his veins Bid him then yield up theAh heaven what am I about to sayhe  cannot  remain neuter All things forbid ithis honourhis principles his lifehis soulhis country  What Raymond shall I do and whither shall I turn What are my late misfortunes to compare with these My son and my daughter both both taken from me Yet go my friend This follows you by express If I never see you more farewell for ever  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CXII  EDWARD CORBETT TO HIS FATHER  AFTER having been thirteen months agonized amongst the wounded and more than once considered as the prize of death I am at length able to write a few lines to acquaint you that I exist by which information I flatter myself I shall make a father a sister and a friend most happy The arm and shoulder which were wounded are at length cured without amputation but the half of the left cheek is gone These tidings I had caused to be conveyed to England long since by letters sent at different opportunities by various means of conveyance but as I have  not received your replies I fear either those miscarried or mine have never reached you Indeed war puts a dreadful stop to this branch of communication although the only one which can relieve the pains of so p  rilous an absence  WASHINGTON offers me the mean of future retreat and inactivity  consideration I suppose of my fears But I am now too far engaged to accept this with any honour I wish it may be no more necessary to fire and they  talk  indeed of peace but there is no real prospect of such a blessing being at hand I fought at first in my own defence and must I fear continue to do so still The English persist  to call those cowards whom they prove to be men and feel to be heroes Tomorrow I shall once more fix the bayonet and shoulder the musquet  Every  man fights in this country we arm not for pay but for property not for the wages of war but for liberty and life  Wherefore does my old friend Henry stay idling at home  Now half the Youth of Europe are in Arms  Why does he not take one side or the other as principle directs He was wont to maintain with me warm disputes in favour of GreatBritain but by this time his opinion must be changed and the cause of America must be dear to him were it only in  respect of her youth her bravery and her misfortunes Tell him I should be glad to receive him hereto receive him in that case as a brother and on those conditions too we will both return one day or another and enjoy the fruits of a double marriage for notwithstanding your resistance my father I must still remind you that I have a heart only for Louisa God send all together happy of one mind and in one house I care not in what kingdom or in what country  EDWARD CORBETT  LETTER CXIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I WAS mounting my horse as your letter and its enclosure which I return to a father's throbbing bosom arrived I took my foot from the stirrup to read to weep and to rejoice  Oh Mr Corbett you ought never to despair The power who could raise your son almost from amongst the dead and who was indeed dead long since in the imagination of his family may yet preserve to you a daughter  How all the links of this dear con+necting chain cling together It is surely the hand of Providence which rivets each I here devote myself an humble instrument and hasten to prove the sentiments I prosess Be comforted My ever dear Corbett be comforted and farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXIV  TO LOUISA CORBETT  I AM an old man in a sad sick chamber without any human being to smoothe the thorny pillow Oh Louisa Louisa I am bereft of all Leave for a little while your house and hasten to mine I now fondly approximate every person who has been dear to any part of my family and who hath had more claim to our tenderness than the sister of Henry Yet let me not forget in my sorrow to tell you of one joy that sparkles in the cup of bitterness which is allotted me to drink My son Edward lives and he mentions Louisa Hammond not coldly Come and let us talk of  him together All ambitious views are worn from my heart Renew your gentle hopes and fear not to avow them Ah that Henry and Edward were both safe from the calamities of war and both within the reach of these paternal arms Oh you know not the pain in which I write Come then if the father of Edwardthe yet existing Edward be estimable  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CXV  TO C CORBETT ESQ  PROVIDENCE and God what have I read Is it not vision Is it not delirium Is it not the vapour of the soul for ever painting its idol image Edward alive Oh the poor Emma the generous Henry the godlike Edward You have transported me I know not what I write▪ Ease me satisfy me I cannot bear it I am in heaven I am distracted  LOUISA HAMMOND  LETTER CXVI  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  WHAT would I not give to recall the heedless thing I have committed to the post A servant has been to the office to recall it but it is gone In the hurry of my heart I have abruptly told what should have been opened by the gentlest gradations But if you are greatly afflicted it will I trust be of a joyful nature and produce no mischief  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CXVII  TO LOUISA CORBETT  I AM commissioned by a friend on whose veracity I can depend to impart a piece of news to my Louisa which is delightful as unexpected It is foreign news and America has some sort of connexion with it but I cannot be more explicit till I know what present health you are in possession of since the least alarms are not to be hazarded in a state like yours  Tell me that you are very stout and you shall hear more  I am sorry my business detains me so long from you It is nearly finished  and then I shall be wholly at your service  For Emma what can I say but that she is a glorious girl  CAROLINE ARNOLD  LETTER CXVIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  IT is every way confirmed The pleasure is too mightymy very brain turns with transport Yes I will fly to your chamberI will fly to my  father  Oh prepare prepare to receive another daughter for I am I amhow shall I speak itI  am no more the widow but the WIFE of EdwardAnd we have a  son  I will bring him under my arm I cannot explainI am too happy  Should  I not be happy My husband lives and his father at length acknowledges  LOUISA CORBETT  LETTER CXIX  TO LOUISA CORBETT  OH my child my child my arms are openLet them embrace and own you without delay The coach shall be at your door early in the morning and convey you toa parent in  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CXX  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I WRITE sitting on the side of Louisa's bed She cannot have the pleasure to attend you at present being suddenly taken ill Do not therefore think of sending your coach till you hear further from  CAROLINE ARNOLD  LETTER CXXI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I TROUBLE not my dear father with relating the dangers of the sea the tempests which have deformed  its bosom nor the various inconveniences I have experienced since I lost sight of every object I had been accustomed to behold My soul has been too intently occupied with what I have left and with what I am in search of to afford any sensations of common fear or common curiosity I cast the eye of steady attachment over this undulating world and imagine myself guarded from all the ordinary dangers of the ocean by the protecting power who proportions my spirits to the toils they undergo  I escape suspicion from the crew I write without kowing the time I may be able to send The unsteady motion of the vessel distorts the characters  of my pen so do not attribute to distress of heart what is the effect of mere situation Adieu oh adieu Of every letter I will send duplicates that no chance may be lost to ease your suspense  Emma  LETTER CXXII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  ACCIDENT favours me I trace the footsteps of Emma I am now in the house from which she lately departed On my arrival here I overheard some sailors upon the quay reading aloud one of your advertisements after which two of them  swore it must mean the fair looking boy who lodged a few nights ago at the ship and sailed in the Henry lettre of marque I caught at this and am so far rewarded in my enquiry Farewell The opportuity of following your child presents itself Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  OH Mr Corbett the abrupt joy produced by your late intelligence has counteracted the tender designs of Edward and thrown his poor Louisa into a condition which  makes me tremble The settled calm of her mind has long been overthrown and I who have been her almost constant companion can assure you that when she has thought herself the most tranquil she has been nearest that state which of all others in this sorrowteeming world is the most afecting Indeed sir you should have been less precipitateyet you meant kindly You acknowledge her for a daughter It is impossible to tell you in what a style of enthusiastic gratitude she speaks of this All will be well and yetsoft she wakes Oh what a look how wild how fearful I must leave off writing  CAROLINE ARNOLD  LETTER CXXIV  TO MRS ARNOLD  A CURSE attends all I do and all I say Oh that I could find the wretch who still cherishes the deathful spirit of this exterminating war I would rush upon him and seize him as the betrayer of  both  the bleeding countries which he has sacrificed to the lust of dominion and the avarice of power Alas the misfortunes which he has brought upon the state are contemptible in the comparison with that anguish that horror that desolation which rends away the softening ties of private lifewhich tears the heartstrings of family and friend  Man of blood come forwardif thou art bold enough stand forthmeet the swoln eye of a father whose house thou hast despoiled of all his little treasure  Oh Mrs Arnold this rage is vain My soul is compounded of ten thousand violences each retrogade each inconsistent I am execrating  myself  for have I not myself pushed on the terrors I deplore I have Fool Dotard Villain  Hah letters are brought The knock of the post goes through my heart Away vile flannels The wellknown characters carry off all  bodily sensation as I behold them I have them before me  Oh horror horror Oh my child my EmmaRead pity meah no read and  detest  me  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER CXXV  TO C CORBETT ESQ  The inclosure from Emma  AMERICA  BOUND by promise by obligation and by the laws of nature to send you faithful accounts of myself I dare no longer conceal the incidents  which have happened to the veriest wretch that ever  My dear dear parent turn all your anger into compassion if all that remains of Emma be yet dear or yet alive in your remembrance  Our vessel has been attacked has fought and is taken Oh the mountains of men murdered by men that lately lay strewed about me My blood runs cold some of it indeed is  shed  for I am  wounded  but it is slightly and in no important part Ah that it were a death'swound rather than  I am watched Pens and paper are objects of suspicion  Ah what have they to fear Emma is no intriguing captiveshe is a prisoner and a mourner who bows to her fate She resists not  I must hide this poor remnant of narrative in my bosom  Fresh prisoners are brought  They are entering What crouds What  Oh my God is it possibledo not my eyes  SECOND INCLOSURE FROM SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  CORBETT the seal of Providence is surely upon my enterprize Oh happy chance I have at once saved and rescued your daughter It pleased God to carry me into the same place of confinement where I found her mingled with the multitude of our unhappy countrymen A violent shriek upon my entrance betrayed her to me Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes so familiar with her voice and her features She fainted in my arms  The prisoners were too much involved in the sullen gloom of their  own melancholy to regard the distress of another The paper which I inclose spotted as you see with drops of blood from her own lovely arm fell from her bosom By the time she recovered one of the officers who had guarded us approachedShe looked at him a moment it being the first time she had seen him since he came in and then sunk without any appearance of life upon the floor She lay as a corpse  Oh merciful HeavenOh God great and gracious God cried the officer it isit isit must be Emmait must be my SISTER  Presently Emma and Edward Corbett for it was your son my friend were both embracing upon their knees  It was no time to explain She was moved out of the prison I was permitted to attend Edward Corbett in his own arms conveyed her to an apartment He obtained leave of absence from the farther duties of the day He was the nurse of your poor Emma Oh Mr Corbett  I  was not idle  Washington happened to be quartered at the same town preparing the manoeuvres of a new attack He is easy of access and being at liberty on  a parole of honour I gained an interview  Ah can you not guess its motive what  could  it be but the  freedom  of the captive Emma The General heard the story of her love as I related it I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own former folly I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it The soldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear He wept  Sacred said he be the rights of hospitality I am not at war with the  affections  Ever priviledged be  their  emotions I feel them all The  beauteous prisoner is at liberty Sir Robert to go where she pleases I shall appoint persons to attend her who may prevent all interruption and insult but  you  methinks Sir Robert should continue to follow her fortunes as a  friend  you are  both  free  I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings Emma had by this time acquainted him with her situation  At what a moment did I enter the room Your son was pronuncing or rather  attempting  to pronounce the names of wife and parent of Louisa and his little Edward And have I then these blessings cried he and is  my father  yet  in ignorance what claims what doublytender claims Louisa Corbett hath upon him He then pressed his sister in his arms and they wept together  Surprizes came too fast upon the hapless youth He knew not that Henry was under arms He did not know that he was an enemy Yet he dropped for awhile the fierceness of the soldier and acted as a manas the child of natureas the husband of Louisa and the brother of Emma Then go my sister said he your career is too glorious to be checked In contemplating your conduct I rise above all the prejudices of party Alas my sister I know too well the  sorrows of love and separation not to respect them You find me here the foe of Henry but it is not now the day of battle and were he at this moment here should I not expand these arms to receive the lover of Emma Go then But we are on the eve of a desperate undertakingOur army moves tomorrow I tremble for thee Perhaps we may never meet moreperhapsah retire retire my best loved sister ere the idea of losing you for ever should tempt me to break my promise and  This fraternal kiss this affectionate embrace and farewell Give me not leisure to reflect let me not have opportunity to consider the consequences  of thusAh take her from me Sir Robert she is gaining on my affections and I shall not be able  Here he stopped Mr Corbett Emma beheld the gathering storm of tenderness coming on and exerting a resolution more than human as fearing she should be prevented from purs  ing the great object of her adventure which was even dearer than a brother she caught me by the arm and shortened a scene too poignant to be continued  No sooner were we aloneI am interrupted Farewell  IN CONTINUATION  No sooner had we got beyond the reach of those sighs which were breaking from the heart of Edward than his lovely sister fell upon her knees pressed my hand to her bosom and spake thusOh generous deliverer I devote to thee the first moment that the confusions of crouding incidents allow to pour sorth the tribute of my gratitude I ask not the means by which heaven directed you to me but I feel the motive of your voyage so pathetically so perfectly soah Sir Robert wherefore do you heap on me this agonizing goodness Wherefore did you pursue the footsteps of one whose preoccupied heart and  plighted hand make it impossible to reward your kindness or your generosity Not even a beloved brother whom I thought breathed no more not even Edward longlost and newly found could prevail with me to forego the purpose of my pilgrimage No by this affecting effusion of tears which are now bathing your hand I swearbut it is unnecessary Behold a woman firmly resolved Sir Robert oh why are you thenindeed it is vain  indeed  it is Go then I conjure you return to my dear my drooping fatherassure him that his Emma is in no dangertell him that his darling son is found alas how I forget myself of this you say he is already informed but at all  events return it is to no end that you follow me how can you expect  I expect it  not  Miss Corbett said I attempting to raise her up  Here will I remain cried she till you pledge to me your honour that you will here close the debts which it will never be in my power to discharge It is no place or time for argument Sir Robert You are even now preventing me from the great business of my life I beseech you to leave me I am not ignorant of your passion but I thought your prudence in never revealing it to me by your own mouthin short sir I must insist on  I saw her mistake my dear Corbett and briefly explained it How shall I describe to you the emanation the burst of tender gratitude when she foundbut indeed I do not deserve half she said or half she thought  Alas it is passion still that drives meonnot indeed the passion which partakes of one gross image or of one vehement appetite Pitied be the wretch who persecutes an engaged heart Yet I love to see to serve to oblige herI love to  Again interrupted No wonder I am writing amidst scenes of constant disturbance The seats and theatres of war are before me The  guards of a generous enemy in compassion to private woe are in front and in rear It is all deathful preparation There is no prospect of peace On every brow is defiance In every eye flashes the bloody determination We hear the shrieks of widows and daughters and fatherless children as we move forward Families are busied in burying their dead rescued from the corruption of promiscuous carnage Hearses and funerals pass thick along The bell of death tolls out in every street but Emma is still fixed in her design Her eyes melt her countenance is pale but her heart pants with love and her soul is undaunted Adieu  IN CONTINUATION  Oh sacred force of sovereign tenderness Emma has tidings of her Henry Our enquiries have at length terminated in success He is now with his regiment off John'sTown Thither we are bending our course with the utmost expedition I send you not the minutiae of intervening adventures They yield to enterprizes of greater moment We are within one days journey of the place  By heavens Corbett the roses are suddenly thrown over the cheek of your child and the pale of fatigue and sickess and loss of blood which has not been inconsiderable all give way  to the joyful expectation of seeing her Henry  Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our disappointments to amiable account To conquer affection is not I feel always possible but to direct it from one worthy path into another when the former is unfit or unjust is assuredly in our power Henry himself cannot adore Emma more sincerely than myself My whole heart is hers oft it trembles oft it bleeds but the choice either to be the object of esteem or the object of aversion is before me Oh I would not forfeit the partial sentiment which my conduct has lodged in the breast of Emma for any other earthly enjoyment  She owns me for her friend her  first  of friends She talks to me without reserveShe looks at me sometimes till the heart's soft tear is in her eye Ah that tear it is more worth than the possession of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold grandeur or importunity extorted into their arms I feel it stream over my senses Blessed sympathy Pure effusion Generous glorious Emma  I am penciling these informations of our route sometimes in the vehicle and sometimes in a room  Emma has this moment desired the driver to stop The door of the chaise is open she jumps out saying  to me in a whisper that a lucky thought strikes her  I will follow her  IN CONTINUATION  God of all goodness didst thou ever create another Emma  In passing along she took note of some bushes which were covered thickly with a duncoloured berry that clustered in the hedgerows I assisted her in gathering these without daring to ask for information as to causes She hath an air of intreaty which cuts short all curiosity about motive and leaves us no other solicitude  than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience  I knew not the design of Emma in picking the berries till the evening and  then  she explained to me their use  Now for an  experiment  dear Sir Robert said she taking up the bundle and going into her chamber at a publickhouse where we baited at twilight  In about an hour she reenteredshe  reentered  Corbett but oh how different from that Emma who had so recently retired You know the clear and lucid white that mixes with the  eloquent bloom in her countenanceyou know that rich tint of tenderness and ardour of pathetic softness and graceful passion which forms her complexion Imagine my astonishment at beholding these discoloured in the darkest shade of that peculiar disguise which the juice of the berries we had collected cast over the skin The stain was deep strong and apparently fixed It resembled almost exactly the hue of some of the savages whom we had observed to be wounded in a town through which we passed  It was certainly  inspiration  said Emma rejoicing at the alteration as she surveyed it in the glass Ah how preferable this precious dye continued  she to the fairest complexion in the world I shall assist Henry I shall touch his dear hand and attend him in every danger without distressing him by surprize or disarming him by softness Oh my good Sir Robert romantic as may seem the steps I have taken be assured that I proceed with the utmost caution I do not even  now  design to interfere with the horrid virtues of Henry's profession I will not dare to place myself betwixt him and his duty I will share his dangers but cannot consent any longer to bear about a wretched being without at least attempting to render it serviceable to my friend Your generosity well fits you to receive these apologies if indeed any apologies  should be necessary for the conduct of Emma on this trying occasion  I could not reply Mr Corbett Even her avowals of the affection that she bears to Henry become new sources of my tenderness and admiration But we are setting off again  The next stage brings us to***  Adieu  IN CONTINUATION  Oh Corbett Corbett who shall anicipate a moment's joy a moment's satisfaction By what an accident was my last sentence interruptedYour sonyour poor sonyour Edward  your dear your darling Edward is now  indeed    Bear up my hapless friend against the storm To learn to suffer is the science of humanity Each has his throes of heart War which level millions with the dust has at length  But oh the generous youth in what a cause he fellUnable to support our departure he obtained  i  furlow and followed us The human general permitted him to seek his sister and either guide her to the arm of Henry or persuade her to return He promised to return in three days Alas he will return no more A party of the English were burning  a village after a sudden attack Edward drew his unavailing sword to defend himself and the inhabitants who were flying different ways in terror and despairAnd there my friend it was your son received his woundhis wound of death  The conquerors drove off the cattle loaded themselves with the spoils of conquest then suffered the peasants to escape and returned to the troops from whence they had been detached  Edward bled fast but having traced our route he gave directions to the two soldiers who accompanied him and pressed onward He was resolved  once more he said to behold his sister The men who were indeed of those under his command obeyed his orders supported him on each side as he sat in the chaise till poor young man  You know the rest He sunk upon one of their shoulders and with his dying breath insisted on their taking his corpse to Emma of whom he had received tydings by the guide who had last left us and whom he met on his return  The poor fellows came on disconsolate with their dead master They reached the town where we stopped and were passing the window of our  inn when we heard a cry of "the armies are engaged the armies are engaged"  The postilion got from his horse the two soldiers who had taken the precaution to alter their dress as Americans leaped from the carriage and joined the multitude that thronged the streets  The body of Edward was deferred Emma who had then just finished her remarks on her disguise seeing a man lie motionless approached the chaise door and there she beheld  Oh Mr Corbett what accumulated miseries is it fated for this virtuous woman to undergo  'Tis  I  then that have  caused  thy death thou beloved youth said she No language can describe her agonies but they were attended to by none but myself for the whole town was in consternation at the news of the engagement Every house was emptied The two armies had marched all night and distributed their forces We heard of the largest parties being engaged off John'sTown and in that place was quartered the regiment of Henry What was to be done Edward lay dead before us Emma was folding his claycold body in her arms She seemed to be lost in a stupor of irremediable grief She forgot for awhile her Henry The alarm spread every moment more widehorror  exhibited itself in every possible form To continue in such a situation was madness to leave the breathless remains of Edwardoh shocking thoughtOh Mr Corbett the exigencies of war and the terrors of a town under such a panic are not to be described Old men were moving their decrepid limbs from door to door in despair of escape and mothers with their children went wailing by us  With pious haste these hands assisted by my heart which is devoted to every connexion of Emma prepared an hasty grave for the reliques of your sonEmma touched at the ceremony burst into a flood of tears and exerting herself beyond what is reported  of her sex joined in the last sad offices of love  We are just come from the sacred spot where Edward is depositedEmma recoversshe has been several times upon her knees during my marking these circumstances of our distress Let us go on Sir Robert she says or rather oh generous man remain you here and let me proceed my duty to Henry yet remains  It was in vain to expostulate She saw the danger but felt no emotions of dismay All feminine and gentle as she is she rose above the spirit of humanity  I insisted on the privilege of attending She pressed my hand within hers and we set out for the scene of action  It was altogether an impulse of most solemn enthusiasm Emma was resolved and I am the friend of Emma  Yet the tearful looks which she cast towards Edward's grave pierced me to the heart One hallowed kiss more imprinted upon that earth Sir Robert and I will delay no longer Pity a sister  I stood at some distance and saw the lovely one depart O what minutes  were these She came forward as if she had made up her mind and then while the resulution seemed nearly formed nature relapsed again into a sister's tenderness and yet once more she embraced the earth  At last summoning her utmost strength she exclaimed "the will of God be done" and then in weeping submission joined me  IN CONTINUATION  Surely Emma Corbett is an angel and not a mortal woman I have had near thirty hours severe sickness a fever as violent as sudden seized me It could not have happened at a crisis  more cruel for we are in the very midst of personal dangers yet nothing could tempt Emma to leave me one moment She has nursed me as I were her child She administered the cordials with her own dear hand Never was parent half so tender such softness of gratitudesuch overpowering attention Oh bless her bless her I am now able to pass on and to pursue the footsteps of my beloved associate  Adieu Adieu  IN CONTINUATION  Oh heavens I tremble to tell you how near we are to the field of battle  We can hear guns firing in the neighbouring woods The English are skirmishing with the rebels in twenty different parts of these environs  IN CONTINUATIION  Yes Corbett Henry is amongst them He is spoken of by these poor trembling peasants and their masters as the most gallant officer in the army of the British General No person ventures now to no to bed It i  altogether a scene of bloodshed havock and horror The feeble Emma droops under her fatigue  I write as moments permit resolved every way to shew my affection to your dear family as far as it be possible though heaven only can tell whether this pacquet will ever  Oh dreadful extremity some wounded men are passing by us in a waggon Emma rushes forward to enquire of the driver if Mr  Hammond  yet lives  "He has been fighting since daybreak" Such the reply  A young woman is at this moment following the corpse of her husband It is indeed too much Emma is bowed to the earth Oh if she dies  IN CONTINUATION  Better tydings The rebels are routed We have traversed the environs but in vain The English are said to be on their return to John'sTown Emma breathes in expectation Oh for strength a little longer and all will be well Sir Robert says she  IN CONTINUATION  The dreadful news is arrivedOh Mr Corbett the blow is struck The life of your poor Emma must soon close for Henry Hammond ishow  shall I speak itHenry Hammond is  Dead  IN CONTINUATION  The men who have escaped the slaughter are returned and confirm the news Emmathe agonized Emma is at the point of  I cannot speak I cannot write I shall not survive her  Adieu  PS Perhaps this is the last account either of us may be able to transmi  an officer whom I have just met is appointed to go off  with dispatches to England The opportunity must not be lost Oh Corbett if you never hear more receive the last prayers of one whose life is valuable only as it can promote the happiness of Emma that being now for ever obstructed for ever closed what is there in this world that can render tolerable the existence of such a wretch as  ROBERT RAMOND  N B I have ventured to whisper it very softly to Emma that I am about to  seal  the pacquet which my trembling hand has written as it could snatch the flying minute  "To my  father  said she Oh God Oh God Telltell him  Here she folded her arms looked up to heaven tried to articulate more and sunk upon the bed  Unfortunate Corbett This fatal war has reduced all the honours and blessings of your house to the dust Alas how many thousand fathers  beside  has it not wounded beyond the reach of this world's remedies  I have stolen from the chamber of Emma to scribble the  inclosure  in the presence of proper witnesses by whom it is attested As we are dying in virtue do  thou  oh venerable man  still try to live in peace and await the stroke which shall be commissioned from above in God's good time to summon you to us  One more look at Emma that I may send you the latet intelligence  She breathes  The silver chord is not quite broken yet the cold  cold  dews descend so fast  NoI have after the pause of another hour visited her again  In her pulse there is yet promise In her eye there is yet hope Poor  Corbett let it comfort youlet it reconcile you to life  A third time I have looked in upon her The officer who is going to the head quarters with the news of the various fortunes that have attended the detached parties in this part of the country has in great humanity waited I told him that a father's happiness or despair was concerned in his obliging me His last minute is come At that minute your cherub child appears to mefor I dare not deceive youfrom another hand it will come with a more crushing weight  Now noweven  now  my friend you are I fear within a few seconds of being childless  If her fever continues to rage another hour as it rages at this crisis no earthly power can delay her passage to heaven At this we ought not to grieve perhaps but humanity shaken to her center cannot  Oh my God I heard a shriek  I dare not stay another moment Oh farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXVI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  From Henry Hammond  THAT paragon of her sex your daughter That man too soaring above the flight of humanity who attended her as the companion of all her perils all her pangs The writer of this letter or more properly speaking the person by whom this letter is dictated is at a loss by what means or in what language to convey to you the wonders which yet he is most anxious to impart  By gentle degreesoh Mr Corbett let me open upon you the blessings which by the contrivance of  Providence have been brought about Summon your heart to bear the best the dearest news which it is in the nature of human things for you to hear O let the agony of  that  information which Sir Robert Raymond's letter has doubtless produced be in great measure done away by the happier tydings that will salute you in this  The  handwriting  of the person now dictating would too much discompose you He makes use therefore of an amanuensis to prepare the way to cir+cumstances of uncommon joy and to give them to you in the security of more progressive explanation  The leading step to every other felicity you must hear  first  You who have de  ply drank of the bitter cup must now try to support without intoxication the taste of sweeter ingredients  From the point of death your Emma has recovered The interposing hand of heaven was  suddenly  extended  Ten days after the departure of Sir Robert's pacquet she was in a situation to leave her bed To what  purpose  did she leave it Resolution oh how sacred is thy force when animated by the breath of love  If Henry be dead said she it is still the duty of Emma to pay him the mournful offices which she has paid to Edward  She insisted on searching for the corpse of the man who had caused all her misfortunes  The generous Sir Robert Raymond was at that time himself confined by sickness which threatened his life when he was out of danger Emma gave him in tenderest charge and set out alone towards those woods where some late skirmishes had passed On her way she had the precaution to use again those berries which tinge the skin to these she  added a certain bark that had been mentioned to her in the course of her various enquiries  Behold oh Mr Corbett behold the dear and delicate Emma wandering unprotected in the woods of AmericaBehold her bearing over her tender shoulder the mere necessaries of decent coveringBehold the most gentle and most female form exposed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown countrypicking her food from the hedgesstraying she knew not whitherin disguisein disorder in despair  Incredible were the toils of her researchincredible her fatigue The  forests are here you know of great extent the wilds immesurable  After several days travelling during which time she had not encountered any passenger who could give her the least intelligence she sat herself down as usual about the noon and wept over her misfortunes  Scarce had she rested a moment ere the clamour of human voices shouting at a small distance caught her attention She pressed hastily forward through the foliage and observed at a little aperture in the forest a party of soldiers engaging with a tribe of Indians but while she was eagerly examining the persons of the  former  the  latter  were put to flight and retreated with the utmost prercipitation the soldiers pursued and both were out of sight ere Emma had time to approach nearer to them  She saw enough however to convince her that the regimentals were British and the uniform of the officers such as belonged to the regiment of Henry you will guess her despair when she did not perceive Henry amongst them  The bodies of several English soldiers were seen in different parts of the forest but the corpse of Hammond could by no diligence be found  Still indefatigable she went on though by this time reduced almost to the last exigencies of nature and every thing subdued but tender resolution and the love which inspired it  At length Providence relented to her wishes and directed her steps to a broad common pathway across which was extended a human figure lying as dead with an arrow sticking in his bosom You already perceive that it was no other than  Henry himself  This you  may  perceive but no tongue can give you the faintest idea of that unparalleled heroism and fidelity which now inspired the soul of Emma She found the body yet warm the pulse slowly moving and  the heart languidly beating with life She extracted the arrow and sucked the woundshe had heard of the Indians using shafts whose points were envenomed and rightly concluding  this  to be one of them applied to it her lovely lips without hesitationThis additional danger was an additional motive to the deed Oh Mr Corbett whatan angel is Emma  Signs of existence increased With scarce a covering from the sky the affectionate Emma sheltered her unfortunate charge for many days Ere his senses returned she thickened her disguise by all the arts in her power Oh can any thing less eloquent than the great Author of Nature describe  to you the transport of this wondrous creature when she first beheld the longclosed eye of Henry open on the light and open on herself  Think Mr Corbett how difficult  concealment  must have been at this extatic moment then consider what presence of mind was necessary to repress the dear and dangerous effusion The silver tones of the softest voice in the world were so artfully changed as to correspond with the rest of her appearance She fed him with what the fortune of an hour's hunting amongst the fruits of the forest afforded He could not move No soldiers returned Men drop in a skirmish and are sought for no more  No house was near no hut and she dared not stray too far from the place where he lay lest she should lose sight of the spot But now Henry felt the puncture of a want which even Emma could not accommodate Fruits and vegetables collected by chance as they grew obvious and within the beat of Emma's journeyings were too unsubstantial It seemed as if famine would compleat what poison had begun For lack of proper nutriment after fatigues so imminent he was reduced to an extreme of languor even worse than that of Emma whom tenderness seemed to have rendered superior to every thing that could befall herself  In these moments it was that Henry yielded to despairin these moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector  Oh generous unknown said he feebly whosoever thou art receive the dying acknowledgements of the man whom thou hast endeavoured to rescue from an untimely death Had those kind endeavours succeeded what thanks shouldest thou receive from one of the  best  the  dearest  but it may not beI am nearly exhaustedperhaps ere yet another hour moves bylest that  should  be the case let me oh let me while yet I have the power to call down heaven's choicest blessings on that lovely  mourner whose tears are haply streaming at this moment for the expiring HenryAh sir ah worthy youth couldst thou see hercouldst thou attest for me these dying sentimentscouldst thou assure her that with my latest breathBut that is impossible she is a thousand leagues from these fatal shores No matter Oh hear me GOD do  thou  this  night  this  instant  suggest to her what was my last employmentmy last aspiration Oh Emma Emma my life my love  Here he fell on the bosom of Emma and would  indeed  have died had he known it was Emma that supported him  She pressed his hand She could not speak To the Omnipotent Father of Mercy she cast the imploring eye  Let not the human heart give up its confidence in Heaven It is never too late to trust  A team now past within sight of this disconsolate pair They were laden with provisions and apparel drawn in sledges and small waggons and were on their way to three detachments of soldiers who had applied to the General for these accommodations that were stationed on the north side of the forest Amongst this groupe were also some cattle of which some were  cows It is unnecessary to say what use the unwearied Emma made of these her winning address and the moving simplicity of her grief joined to the wretched situation of an English officer who appeared to be almost at the point of death gained so entirely upon the soldiers and people who attended the sledges and waggons that they adminstered whatever could promote the wish of Emma and even furnished her with a sledge a mule and a guide to carry Captain Hammond to John'sTown  Thus providentially saved from death a  second  time I shall not trouble you with other difficulties in the passage or in the progress of Henry's recovery  though the least of these were enough to immortalize Emma Corbett bett but I shall convey your imagination to John'sTown where Henry and his protecor at last arrived and found Sir Robert Raymond recovered from his fever and just about to set out again in pursuit of Emma  To her assiduous cares were now superadded those of this excellent man and Henry became in a short time the nurseling of both He could walk converse and his wound was healing Emma's dear perilous experiment was guardedthe prospect clear on every side One afternoon Sir Robert gradually prepared Henry for the softest surprize that could touch the heart of  a lover he discovered himself to be the friend of Mr Corbetthe assured Henry that he saw Emma in good health a little before he left England he asserted in the strongest terms her constancy her attachment her loveand said that such was the force of her affection he should not wonder some day or other to hear that she was arrived in America    Yes  and in America she  is  arrived cried she entering at this moment agreeable to the plan concerted She  is  arrivedshe is  here  she is now in the presence of her beloved Henry she now offers him the hand of Emma for EVER  Emma was yet in her boy's apparel but had washed the stain from her lovely countenance and discovered enough to throw Henry first upon his knee to the restoring God and then into arms of this tenderest of women  You will not expect I should tell you what  either  felt at that moment You will not expect I should describe the series of delicious sorrow and gratulations which followed while all the enterprizes of Emma were relating to Henry He found himself the most blest most honoured and most beloved of men He found Emma all that language  cannot  express He found  in short it was a false rumour you see that reached Emma at John'sTown respecting the death of Henry He was reserved for Emma to discover and to restore  He is discovered he is restoredEmma is now before himEmma the most generous most  Oh Mr Corbett Henry is the happiest of mankind He now TELLS you that he is  he  dictates these explanatory sheetsthey flow from his grateful heartthe tenderest mercies of Providence have been upon him they are to be seenthey may be felt you will no longer refuse to give him the hand of Emma ah that  he were worthy of her Disclose he beseeches you these tender circumstances to Louisa his sister Oh he can hold no longer he is too too happy he takes the pen from the amanuensis and No it is not necessary to sign the letter The writer is now known  Adieu  LETTER CXXVII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THE blessings of Providence are at length manifest since the pacquet from Henry must ere this be come to hand It is not easy to tell  you how totally I have in  them  annihilated  myself  for many days past Henry recovers apace The attentions of Emma indeed so pointed and so pure might almost raise him from the dead Yet I almost envy her the share she has had in this discovery and all its happy consequences I can scarce forgive my illness for seizing me at such a time It is Emma alone who has been the saviour of Henry It is Henry only who can merit such salvation You can image to yourself nothing so tender as his gratitude so warm as his affections or so perfect as his delicacy From his somewhat military style of address I expected not this and am equally surprised and delighted Yes my dear old companion  you have yet a daughter and will in a few days boast also  Oh my friend how infinitely I fall beneath the standard of my ambition How incorrect is human virtue How frail is human fortitude The prospect of Henry's becoming your SON does not charm this rebel heart half so sincerely as it ought to do and yet heaven is witness that I am doing every thing to advance his health and his happiness  Selfinterested perhaps still I doat on promoting the felicity of Emma by any means I am proud to please her I consider the youth of Henry and wish it the joys it is formed  to taste I reflect on my own age and think that I am too silly to be pardoned I am entirely convinced of my folly and yet hug it to my heart Ah Mr Corbett what is there in that subtle and active principle which we thus feed in our bosoms and which turns serpentlike against the nourisher It stings and we are not angry it tortures and we do not  cannot  command it to depart from us Something like the healing balm flows into the wound and recompenses us for all we suffer The misery which is the consequence of a tenderness like mine is compounded of such sweet ingredients that it is not in the nature of the tender heart to wish it were removed And yet my friend  it is most intense I have found the vanity of attempting to argue myself into neutrality It is virtue and beauty that have attractedthat have bound me Ere a soul like mine can free itself from  such  captivity the enchanting powers of its object must change its beauty become deformity and its virtue vice 'Tis out of the question The great point of moral propriety is in every man's power and consequently in mine The human heart loves as it listethit sees its bias and trembles towards it but society religion and the laws are all to be respected and he who presumes to overleap these renders himself contemptible Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXVIII  TO THE SAME  EMMA in all the graces of the female dress appears more lovely from the late concealment of her charms She has resumed her former selfOh Corbett what a womanHappy happy Henry what years of bliss  My friend I am not wellI am not as I ought to beI cannot write  Farewell farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXIX  TO HENRY HARMOND ESQ  ABSENCE from home must have thrown your pecuniary affairs into disorder at any rate the war must have rendered your remittances irregular As a soldier and a single man you might dispense with these obstacles as a connected man about to take on him the sweet charge of providing for a virtuous woman you feel how much the case is altered It is by mere chance I have found out that you are waiting a supply from England On the present occasion that you should  want  cash is most natural that you should  wait  for it is most cruel Luckily I have brought  with me enough to accommodate us bothThe inclosed may answer an immediate purpose You say you are my friend shew yourself such by using what I offer till your return to England when you will please to repay me the amount I am not you see involving you in an obligation but drawing you into a debt The only  interest  I shall desire is that my name may not be mentioned to Emma in this business These circumstances between us  men  are nothingthey are things of courseWomen you know look through a medium so peculiar and are indeed whether married or single so delicately circumstanced that a man of honour trembles  to offer what they tremble to accept I know you want money and so don't be foolish  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXX  TO C CORBETT ESQ  HENRY grows importunate He urges me to assure Emma by virtue of my medical knowledge that his health is established He affects unusual mirth and vivacity to prove this He is become intimate with  the chaplain of the regiment who is engaged to perform the  By heavens Corbett I cannot bring myself either to forget these things or to think of them without misery Inconsistent I shall do all right  ultimately  but opposite sensations are at war within me I walk in the proper path but I am too susceptible of the thorns which wound me  Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXXI  TO THE SAME  TOMORROW oh Corbett is to be the dayHenry presses me to attend He knows not I have any reason for these  heartfelt  objections Emma looks unutterable sympathy She seems labouring for an apology She pities me Her tears attest it Henry beholds them descend and kisses them away with a trembling lip What give her to anotherbe  accessary  to the last circumstance of my despair Oh most agonizingmost impossible  Yet Henry entreatshe appeals to me in the name of parent saviour  What shall I do I wish them happy happy even  together  but to be  present  at the ceremonyto forward the stroke that cuts off every hope for ever Nature recoils at the task and I am too much the subject of her authority to go through it  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXXII  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  OH my friend receive the tribute of my sympathy Generous man what can I do to soften the woes  of which I am unhappily the cause Invent I beseech you some reason to absent yourself on the morrow Call to your aid some pious disguise to save yourself and me ten thousand wounds Your presence will wholly destroy the bliss of the dayeven of that day which gives to me the hand of Henry Indeed it will I see your emotions I see your conflicts They escape your soul's most amiable effort They break through your bosom I see them in your tears I feel them in your sighs For my sakefor your ownfor Heaven'sdo not continue longer  much  longer under our roof I esteem you so truly that I cannot bear the constraint which will soon be imposed Your virtues have  placed you in the second place of my affectionsthe second place is  friendship  and that is yours while I can distinguishwhile I can feel one worthy sensation But oh consider that the first place is  love  and  that  is Henry'sHenry my  almost  husband  He presses he importunes he insists in all the emphasis of tender controulment that tomorrow may be the day He almost chides me for coldness of sentiment towards him  Alas my dear friend it is your sorrows painted in  your  countenance and in your late conversation when we have been together which produces this grateful reluctance  I owe youah what do I  not  owe you I would do muchI would do every thing that is  possible  to serve you  The billet you sent me this morning cuts me deeply You there hint your design to leave Philadelphia  I perceive the motive nay you disdain disguise and have in part avowed it All but this you say you can supportMy dear dear friend author of many a comfortsoother of many a carewhat would I give had no accident of life produced in your gentle breast these sentiments for Emma  Hitherto all has been wellall has been great and glorious You still assure me you can act the only part that remains Of that I am not to be told Yet your friendship is attended by so much suffering so much piercing sensbility that even at this blest moment my heart bleeds for you  If you willoh hard requestif you will gently withdraw yourself for a time only till you have gained composure I will deferI will frame some fresh excuses to Henry for my  Pity me Sir Robert and save us both the pangs of an explanation It will perhaps not be in my power to correspond in  this  way any  more I know your friendship will insist upon my fulfilling to the utmost every duty in life and every engagement Should this therefore be the last letter that passes between us I conjure you to believe that of every petition of every fervent prayer that I offer to heaven your health and your happiness will form a part I did not think it possible that any thing could fall out to make me wretched with the immediate prospect of being united to Henry and yet such is my genuine esteem for you Sir Robert that I cannot be perfectly happy while I am conscious of creating misery to one of the noblest of mankind Henry enters and I can say no more  EMMA  LETTER CXXXIII  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  WHY leave us at this charming crisis oh invaluable friend Will you who have brought my treasure safe through so many perils refuse to see it locked for ever securely in the faithful arms to whose embrace you preserved it Unkind Your servant brings word too that you now lie sick at your apartment yet that you resolve to depart on a tour the instant you can bear to be removed This must not be Emma has delaved the nuptials because she was too much harrassed in spirits And now I will myself put them back a little that they may not want the ornament  of such a friend as Sir Robert Raymond Yes I will defer even the possession of Emma till her most generous protector is able to sanctify the union by his presence You keep your chamber it seems I will enter it without delay You shall not deny me admittance You shall not suffer me to depart till you are in a condition to do so too Emma insists upon this  Adieu ever dear ever valuable Sir Robert adieu  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER CXXXIV  TO EMMA CORBETT  OBLIVIATE the billet obliviate the conversation 'Twas feeble humanity 'Twas the graceful relapse of the heart which started a little from its purposed point but returns again and refixes on its center I feel that my very pride is touched Oh Emma you must not so far outstrip me in generosity Delay no longer your nuptials and may the choicest benedictions of Almighty God be shed upon them I am wholly myself again and I am yours in the spirit of holy friendship while I have being  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXXV  TO HENRY HAMMOND  I WILL not suffer you to protract your joys any longer upon my account I write to you from a

not fail to greet you in Philadelphia where I am extremely glad to find all remains quiet  Farewell My tenderest respects await Emma  Hammond  I had almost said Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXXVI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THE greatest trial of mine and perhaps of human life is past for I have just heard that your daughter is the wife of Henry and yet I am able to hold the pen Is there not a certain decent pride that sustains us after the great and difficult duties are performed Something like a preternatural consciousness plays about my heart as I consider this triumph over my own passions It is a sacrifice of  self  to  society  It isoh Mr Corbett I wish them very happy Th  their wedding day a  express has just reached the  e  ireme  I now enjoy  enjoy  did I say Alas can  you not trace the bleeding heartcan you not trace the piercing tho  through  Away it shall not be And yet to Thee my friend I may safely trust ought that remains of unsubdued infirmity If haply you should detect one

friend give me a little time  It is near eleven o'clock at night as I write this period  I did not attend the ceremony which was this morning performed  I do not propose returning to Philadelphia for some days  'Tis a dreary uncomfortable night I am here too in a large apartment alone Sighs burst from my bosom and tears fall from my eyes without any apparent cause The effect of a thick drisly atmosphere perhaps  of a drizly atmosphere Ah noto the passing feeblenesses of nature we are all liable  Haply tomorrow's sun may make me nearer what I  wish  and what I  ought  to be In that fond hope I will now seek repose  Corbett what can be the reason of it At the close of the last sentence I went into my chamber in order to go to bed but I sat myself down in a chair by the side of it and have not attempted to undress though the daylight is beginning to dawn upon me A thousand halfform'd images have been teazing me I am about fourteen miles from that Philadelphia which now contains the loveliest couple I ever beheld Corbett I am extremely weakand extremely a shamed of myself  Fie upon me how can I talk thus You perhaps are mourning the death of a son and the absence of a daughter added to the grief of those disorders which tear your aged frame and render you as wretchedas you are respectable Unhappy parent dear friend adieuof  my  calamities you shall hear no more I blush and silence sits on this selfish subject for ever  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXXVII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I RECEIVED your congratulations I received your blessing and to crown the  whole  of human happiness I have received the hand of your daughter Yet my transport has hurried me into an expression too bold Oh I am a mortal still Mr Corbett still am I vulnerable in a vital part The fearful accounts you have transmitted of my poor sister and of your  own  declining health alarm and wound me Hapless Louisa dear relict of the generous Edward Ah that we had you both here nursed by our care and protected under the shelter of our most affectionate embraces  Sir Robert Raymond too our second father and our first of friends would rejoice at this Yet  he  keeps aloof from us He used to be enamoured of our society and now the deepest solitudes have seduced him from us In vain I invite in vain I implore He is melancholy he is mournful Is there a cause for this Ah that I could remove it I have now been six weeks in the possession of Emma Corbett She is my wife God of Heaven how I thrill with gratitude Yet oh Supreme Bestower of every good if it were thy divine pleasure to restore my sister and my friendsif it be consistent with that awful design into whose depths I presume not to pry to extend to  these  a portion of that felicity thou hast given to Emma and to me the measure of my bliss will be full  indeed  I am soothed by the prayer It will be accepted It was offered in the soul's most empassioned sincerity Oh my father join itjoin it fervently It is now in heaven before the throne the mercy seat Have faith have hope We shall all be happy  What can I say soft enough to convey to you the remembrances of a daughter's duty Wait a little for her own language which is the only proper vehicle to convey the emotions of her heart  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER CXXXVIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I HAVE brought my pulses to be almost as obedient as I wish them Reason is not so weak a power as we make her appear Her province is perhaps misunderstood my friend It is not tyranny but a mild and  genial  authority which she should exercise The subjects of her sway are the passions those of the  tender  kind are with the most difficulty governed  I have applied to this our intellectual sovereign on a different principle I implored her not to inspire me with that  indifference  which is the usual prayer of the disappointed The object  of my love is married to the man of her heart She obtained him at the price of almost unparalleled hazards I saw every hope of possession cut off It was an intolerable agony I bore it till I became almost desperate I indulged the passion even till the indissoluble bonds were tied against me I saw the madness of my pursuit and retiredretired my dear Corbett not to meditate revenge against a happy rival but to manage my own wretchedness and to  think  A serious appeal from the passions to the judgment is seldom made in vain We miscarry chiefly because we are  not  serious but only  suppose  ourselves so  I selected a quiet hour and laid the simple facts before me They were not elaborate The woman of my affection thus I argued is now happily married She is generous enough to pity and respect me for misery that she hath very unwillingly occasioned Accidents have confirmed what Corbett at first betrayed I have too much contributed to her present happiness for her to treat me untenderly and yet my farther intimacy will increase her distress even if it does not spread itself in time to her husband How bitterly does she pay for my former services What hinders her now that she is in the arms of Henry from looking upon my passion as insulting and impious Those very  services Do I then presume and persecute her upon these Oh indelicacy oh folly  But can I conquer my affection No It is not possible it is not necessary To  extinguish bad  passions and to  regulate good  ones are the two great points within the compass of reason To covet any longer the  person  of Emma would be infamous It is an inhibition of law of religion and of God But are the merely sensual passions then at my age so very gross that by no exertion no interest I can subdue them What will be the consequence of my persisting The distress of Emma who now should taste only of joy the suspicion of  Henry whose heart melts in gratitude towards me and my own conscious upbraiding Can I  sustain  these or is an obstinate attachment to the only point which reason refuses me and which after all is hopeless strong enough to support me But  what  then am I to do Does reason bring with her no compensationsno equipoise of rewards for punishments so severe She does and MANY Shall I not rank amongst those the delights of a friendship not less  tender  though less  interested  the  secret  breathed prayer for one human being whose happiness is dearer to  me  than that of any other upon the earththe generous sighthe softening tearthe social smilethe selfgratulationthe  flush of virtue pleased with  herself  the smile of Emmathe assent of HEAVEN  Oh Mr Corbett we have glorious faculties had we the resolution to exert them We are afraid to  begin  The heart trembles at a view of its labour We venture to climb the steep and are dismayed But every difficulty of soul and body diminishes by earnest perseverance However cragged the mountain or slippery its path every effort brings us nearer to the summit the second step is easier than the first the third is smoother than the second It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude When the motive is  so great  as to concern the happiness of  others and our own duty is included surely we should struggle to ascend  I  Corbett  have  struggledI cannot say how much or how long but I can and do tell you in the sincerity of my soul that though I am not nor perhaps shall EVER be again a  happy  man I do not wish either the death of Henry or the alienation of his Emma's affection I can support the presence of both when softness and wedded love sits  fairest  upon their features And tho' many a rising tear warns me that it is time to retire no sentiment of irregular desire invades my heart Henry cultivates my friendship with kindest care I do not impute to him his  happiness  as his  fault  I recede not from his embrace though I seldom  make advances to conversation that relates to Emma and yet Emma is his perpetual subject and his darling theme Her own conduct is such as corresponds with every part of her former life Perhaps there never was a more affecting situation than she has to perform whenever I am present It is indeed too much for a nature so gentle and so ingenuous But I will remove the effect by removing the cause Humanity should not  presume  to be perfect I have carried a conquest as far perhaps as it can go I have acquired strength by an examination of weakness Let me not sink into captivity by foolhardiness I have done much In attempting more I may lose all the laurels I have  won Involuntary thoughts will trespass on the firmest mind Emma is a tender wife a tender friend Heaven continue her so while earth hath a feeling to make life desirable But the familiar intercourse of a private family is somewhat too much for me at present I constrain Emma whenever I visit her and nature impells my steps towards Philadelphia but too oftento appear restrained I beg you will tell my steward to prepare Castleberry for my reception I will return to England There is no danger of a reiapse but I am obliged to repeat the rescuing arguments too often A few months absence will compleat my work Henry and his WIFEI wish Corbett I could write  that word with a steadier handare happy I leave them in the arms of each other I  Oh Corbett Corbett I will set off for England without delay  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXXXIX  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  I KNOW your character and will give you another opportunity to to gratify it for I will offer you an occasion to oblige me I have for some time felt myself extremely indisposed  not I believe in consequence of agitated spirits or of my late fatigues in nursing the dear Henry whom Heaven has restored to my solicitude and my affections but from some  other  cause which feels more internal I have not dared to breathe this matter to Henry and indeed the satisfaction which I receive in seeing him well and youO my generous friendhappy would incline me still to silence were not my pains growing so strong that I cannot any longer conceal them A little however of that kind ministration which your skilful judgment knows so well how to bestow and whose good effects I have already so frequently experienced will I dare say set all right  again Give me your advice in confidence and without delay Blessings attend your gentle heart and noble nature  EMMA  LETTER CXL  TO C CORBETT ESQ  MY baggage was prepared the wind was fair the war would not have prevented me from setting out for England and yet I am delayed Human happiness shifts from point to point of her compass and is never fixed  Emma is again indisposed  You must not expect me  IN CONTINUATION  Unhappy Corbett when will fate cease to persecute your family or to torture your friend I tremble at the symptoms which discover themselves in Emma  Yet do not despair I may be deceived We have long experienced the healing hand remember this and be still  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXLI  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  OH my wife my wifethe treasure of my existence Leave her not Sir Robertleave her not a moment Long has she concealed her misery from a wretch who is fated by every means to distress her  Yes Sir Robert 'tis I and only I have murdered her I am the accursed cause Come to me I conjure you this moment To what am I reserved Is this my happiness These the joys of possessing Emmathe great the glorious Emma Are six months of bliss SUPREME  thus  to terminate Oh that I had diedthat I  had remained for ever undiscoveredthat I had never neverOn my knees I beg your aid your society your consolation Quit your solitude Reside lodge live here I send by express I have orders to join my regiment again Curse on the war I will have no more to do with it Come immediately  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER CXLII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  MR Corbett had it pleased heaven to turn away this bitter cup or given me a less tender nature or  yet let me not dare to murmur I am perhaps blaming what is best  Wretched veteran in sorrow how shall I explain myself to you how conceal what must I foresee be communicated  But oh consider  my  misery I am upon the spot I am a spectator of  the sceneI am behind the awful curtain  EMMA IS POISONED  Shall I proceed  Henry is in the direst parchings of a fever into which grief tenderness and terror have conspired to throw him  Oh that barbed and envenomed shaftthat execrable infection which the lovely lips of the loveliest woman drew from the bosomthe wounded bosom ofher husband  This moment I have opened and read the inclosed  Whatever be the event be proud Corbett be  enthusiastically proud  that Heaven made  you  the instrument to produce so much excellence and virtue as shines forth in Emma I tremble I adore  THE INCLOSURE FROM EMMA  I SEND this to  your  room written in  that  of my husband If you do not join me in my present purpose his affection will destroy him His fever is encreased since you left his chamber but his delirium is less violent He hath an interval of sense  He has just kissed my cheek he felt it wet and wiped off the tear If I write legibly come directly and tell him that I am out of all danger tell him that the venom is all extracted that the present appearances are only the natural effects of a stubborn contagion passing away that I shall speedily recover If you have any friendship for me induce him to believe thisinduce him by your countenance your voice your spirits It may stop the progress of his disorder it may give it a turnit may save his precious life I am appealing to Sir Robert Raymond I know the friend whom I address As to myself I shall do very well I feel that I shall I take every thing you prescribe  I obey all the other people order me I will refuse nothing if you will but restore my Henryrestore my husband  Henry is enough himself to enquire what I am about Asks how I find myselfI have undrawn the curtain and assured him of the alteration He is sensible of it He frequently clasped his hands and thanked his God his BLESSING God  He calls for you  Now is the moment Stay not an instant longer than you have read this haste oh haste to EMMA  I went The poor man is piously deceived Tears of bliss are at this instant coursing along his face He took my hand He laid it upon his heart Let not Emma come too near me said he perhaps my disorder may injure her Tell her I bless her but let her not approach my breath any more O Sir Robert continued he you are now a witness to my joy I feel nothing of my disorder I am quite well bear the tidings to my wife It will assist her recovery It will make her happy  I begged him to be composed  He raved with incoherent joy  Emma entered in the height of counterfeited spirits  Henry was transported and cried Emma shall live  IN CONTINUATION  The fate of Emma will be slower than the fate of Henryfor Henry alas is NO MORE  He yielded his last breath about eleven o'clock this night  He died in the arms of Emma  Emma is this moment on the bed clasping the breathless body  Heaven thinks fit to make me a witness and a partaker of these calamities which I relate by events and not with the circumstances that produced them  The facts will torture but the narrative would kill you poor beloved wardespoiled old man  I talk not to you of my feelings  I only know that I would have shortened my own existence many years to have saved the life of the hapless youth whose corpse is stretch'd under my eye  This may seem unnatural and found untrue I am before the Searcher of Hearts who looks into this deathful apartment I can firmly appeal to his divine attestation  IN CONTINUATION  I have exhausted all words of praise in speaking of your daughter and yet I cannot conceive a language to do her justice  She was prevailed upon to leave the room of Henry soon after midnight Upon seeing me near her as she rose she burst into tears and bid me look upon the bed  It is poor Henry said sheit is the man I soughtthe man I foundthe man I savedthe man whom Providence lentbut to resume  It is MY HUSBAND  Alas it  was  my husbandI am the widowed Emma  Be it so I am not desperate I am humiliated It is very hard I can scarcely bear it He was extremely young You cannot think how I loved him Sir Robert My heart is ready to break but I will not repine I know my duty Indeed I do And I will pursue it You shall see I will my friend  Oh Corbett grief now wholly overwhelmed her and she fell again upon the bed  Other duties press on me said she I must yet get health to sustain them I will compose myself  She was led into another apartment  Her step her look her voice her motion are not to be described  EMMA took leave of HENRY You may image to yourself something like the parting  IN CONTINUATION  Henry is in his grave Emma is not outrageous but inconsolableGrief is at her heart Disease is preying upon her frame But she does not exalt the murmuring voice against the correcting hand  I believe in God  said she to me some time ago My trials are extreme but I shall be unworthy to join Henry again if I sink beneath them  I feel that I shall die but wish it to be a distant blow for oh Sir Robert I have reasons  such  reasons  IN CONTINUATION  Her reasons yet to live cannot any longer be concealed from you my venerable afflicted  Your daughter would live to be the parent of that LITTLE ONE with which Henry has left her  SHE IS WITH CHILD  The poison will not I hope  And yet it is possible that  the case is new  IN CONTINUATION  Emma has formed another resolution of which Emma is alone capable  Thus she spoke  My aged father my distracted Louisa my dear Henry's sister oh lead me to them My medicines may be taken on the sea In following a virtuous and heavendirected affection I have no idea of peril Henry is dead and I have nothing to feara frienda parent lives and I have yet a little to hope Oh Author of Nature endue me with new force new patience Sir Robert be still yourself and quit not Emma  You know my answer  IN CONTINUATION  We are upon our return Emma is very commodiously situated She has a cabbin to herself All that art could do in medicine has been attempted  It is in vain  Corbett  she must die  You will lose your daughter  Her malady is gradual but sureI DARE NOT FLATTER YOU  IN CONTINUATION  I went a little while ago into the cabbin and found your lovely one anticipating all the tender providence of a mother She was employed in those soft cares which the prospectthe very near prospectof her travail justified  a little white robe or wrapper lay on the table finished before her  she had begun to plait the cap  if these Sir Robert said she should ever become usefulif I should follow my husband ere I can suckle  his child at this faithful bosom do not forgetI conjure you do notif the little wretch should livedo not forget to tell it that it was a mother's hand which prepared the mantle that first wrapped its tender form Tell it that for its dear sake I would have  lived  had it been possible  Then pausing a little the exclaimedand here is my husband's picturein that trunk are Emma's lettersyonder is the man's apparel in which I sought for my poor Henry These legacies of love the pledges of a parent's fidelity I bequeath my child happen what may They cannot but be precious Will they not be valued think you Sir Robert  She perceived that my distress was too great  Sir Robert Raymond I glory in your attachment I glory in your friendship Had the world contained or could it  ever  contain any man in the eyes of Emma but he who sleeps beneath its surface it is not a question who would have captivated her heart  At what a time was this spoken Oh Mr Corbett the single sensation of that moment was worth a miriad of vulgar lives  IN CONTINUATION  We are landed Emma livesWe send this by the post which is just setting out It will reach you some hours before  we  shall I write to prevent surprises For Heaven's sake exert yourself to meet your daughter Let me prepare you for her appearance Be not too much alarmed at her languor You must not expect to see the bloom in her cheek the lustre in her eye nor her proportion of limbs so exactly formed or furnished yet she is truly touching truly lovely I am myself much changed but indeed my friend I  shall be to the latest moment of my existence unalterably  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXLIII  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  THE inclosed rough draft of letters will enable you O my friend to trace the vestiges of some unhappy human beings since their departure from London to their return  At present fortune seems to continue our wretchedness by means the most complicate and inventive  Two hours ago we arrived at the house of the unfortunate Corbett It was with the utmost difficulty his daughter reached town  The first object that struck her was a HEARSE standing close beside her father's door In the passage she beheld the undertakers bearing a coffin down stairs The woeworn Corbett was supported between two servants to take his last mournful leave of the friend whose remains were about to be deposited He could not move He had not received my letter from Portsmouth  dispatched three days before It had been misssent The letter did not come to hand till two hours after our arrival He was not PREPARED to receive us  Our chaise drew up still closer Emma rushed outThe poor old manthe daughter  We are not provided with a language to express these horrors  Almost an hour the child and parent remained speechlessit was surprise and agony at once dumb and dreadful  The hearse waited The coffin was placed in it and shut up  The bell is at this instant tolling for POOR LOUISA The sexton is come to tell the attendants that the clergyman is waiting Wretched wife of Edward She died distracted The hearse is driving off  What a house is here Alas it has long and truly been the house of mourning  Corbett and Emma are still together in the next room to that in which I write The servants look amazement and dismay  I hear methinks the voice of my aged associate in friendship and in sorrow  I am called suddenly and hastily  Oh friend oh Berkley to what am I reserved A PREMATURE LABOUR has been brought on by hurry agitation and fatigue This morning's sun sees Emma a mother of a  living  childThe poison seems not to have been in the least degree communicated to this precious pledge It is a female  Alas Emma would leap for joy at this circumstance she would forget awhile her woes in viewing the babe whom Henry had bequeathedShe would present it with some testimony of maternal transport to her drooping  fatherBut thateven Henry's offspring can no longer soothefor EMMA CORBETT IS  dead  Her death instantly succeeded the pangs of the birth It happened at midnightHer frame must have dropped in consequence of the venom which resisted the force and subtilty of all applicationSoontoo soon would the fair victim of constancy have sunk to the tomb but these precipitating agonies added to the restOh they were too much She fell before them  In the expiring moment she called me to her"'Tis Emma's infant▪ take it said she it is a parting giftI  can  no moremy fathermy poor father"  She dropped upon the pillow from which she twice vainly endeavoured to raise her head and lift her eye to the objects about herTHEN BREATHED HER LAST  Thus lived and thus died the most faithful and beautiful of women  Charles Corbett stands fixed over the corpse of his daughter  The old man is now bereft of all "I am childless Sir Robert he exclaimsBehold what CIVIL WAR has done for me"  Berkley I have kissed the claycold lipsI have pressed the claycold  hand On that bedthat very bed  but I dare not indulge reflection  Pierced  as I am I would fain preserve a decent sorrow Ah that I were in my grave Impious wish Is there a single point of space in the petty allotment of man in which something important is not to be done  Yon aged forlorn one now weeping over his child looks up to me alone for something which resembles comfort during the wretched residue of life  The funeral obsequies of Emma are yet to be performed  The widow of Edward hath left a son  The widow of Henry a daughter  I will not die till Heaven's appointed hour I have much occasion still for life  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXLIV  TO THE SAME  I AM just come from the most agonizing ceremony oh Frederick that can possibly pass under the eye of manMay you never feel what otherwise you can never know Easy in your fortunes quiet in your situation unconnected in your interests you can happily for you have no conceptionat least no perfect oneof that rend in the heart which is made by death when youth innocence and beauty is committed to the dustwhen the parent hangs his drooping head over the last sad tenementwhen the orphans  Whatever I said Youth innocence and beautyand do  all  these then go down to the earth's cold bosom Shall none of them ascend The glooms of the soul almost carry sensation into sin They shall ALL ascend The  one  shall ensure everlasting existence to the  others  Innocence shall immortalize beauty and youth  I am reasoning with an almost breaking heart Berkley while poor old Corbett the survivor of his family in all the solemn pathos of grief forgets every pain of body in nursing that which is seated within The romance of youth may teach you to expect that I should execratethat I should summon to my assistance every  infernal powerthat I should tax heaven itself with cruelty and take refuge from altercating man amidst the friendly concealment of impenetrable woods This may perhaps answer the purpose of the novellist but it corresponds not with the nature of your friend No Berkley It is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender indulge themselves in outrage The first burst is past that which began with loudness with vehemence and with vociferation settles into the still the solemn and the affecting The temper stormy and headstrong of Corbett himself terminates in the eloquence of dumb distress The tears fall fast from me as I write  More  impetuous  periods I have felt so  awful  and so  affecting  a crisis never did I experience You who knew not Emma and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart cannot know what I have lost The manner of her deaththe motiveand the whole tenour of circumstances connected with it throw over every passage of the scene a colour so movingly sad that I sit wonderstruck in the room and seem almost in my grave with the world about me I have exerted myself to say thus much at the winding up of this solemn catastrophe lest you my dear Barkley or any other person into whose hands these incidents may fall should presume to question the ways  of ALMIGHTY GOD which are justifiable in every part of this pathetic story Erroneous notions of punishment and reward are perhaps the leading steps to irreligion and infidelity The vile herd of novellists have done an essential injury to the cause of virtue by sacrificing to the pleasure of the reader beyond the simplicity of truth Difficulty in the beginning of a narrative love in the middle and marriages at the end make up almost invariably the recipe of a modern romance This is called rewarding virtue a bad character or two perhaps drops off and that is called punishing vice False foolish conclusion Look into life Doth not heaven's blessed beam shine equally  on the just and the unjust Are all rewards so mechanically contrived Hath virtue no joys of her  own  joys which generous sorrow only can produce Is the sacred struggle of a good man  altogether afflictive  To pass through a road perplexed and thornyto travel through a hard and difficult life without tearing the finer principles from the heart doth it require no better conduct than moves in the machinery of those contemptible pages where all is given up to letter'd art and distorted imagination Are there no sweets in the pensive sighthe pious tear Break they from the mourner without offering him  any  balm Hath heavenborn constancy no comforts Consider  the life of Emma Hath death at once virtuous and christian nothing to lift the survivor's spirit above every care of vulgar being Oh Frederick I am touched by a very tender example In lamenting as I  now  lament say my friend is there  no  dear and welcome mitigations Yes I feelI  feel  that there are Would I part with this generous griefAh no What would I take in exchangeThe universe should not buy it from me I even anticipate the holy satisfaction when I shall steal from the shout and strife of society to the tomb of a virtuous woman Think you I love her less because I no more shall see her Hath she suffered in my esteem  by her ascension into heaven  Shall she lose as an angel what as a mortal she acquired I love her better The Omnipotent placed her in the path of my life to fix and concentrate the best of passions I am not of disposition or age to change again Oh that the daughter of Emma may live Shall I be content with a parent's  common  dutyto cloathe to feed to educate Consider Barkley  whose  babe it is  I have hurried down stairs to examine my treasure  it lives it sleeps I have felt its gentle breath on my cheek  God will spare it  Louisa  's orphan too is mine  Corbett  too shall live I have moved towards his bedside often since I began to write His face is hidhe will not yet endure existence but the hours of resignation are at hand  I conjure you then Berkley to  settle  your opinions about ProvidenceBring your piety to a pointCultivate your tendernessLove like Emma and if you meet with  such  a disappointment do not  transfer  your affection but turn it to a generous account The  vulgar  effect of tender distress is dissipation or despair Had  I  yielded to these a poor old man would have wanted a friend  two lovely infants a parent and I the selfapproving  bosomray  which chears my spirit in this vale of sorrow  Circumscribe  not therefore the rewards of Heaven The writer of a romance would paint me as a wretch without hope who calls down the stroke of fate in pity to his aid Attend  you  to the reality my friend and behold a man who wishes still to live and who thinks himself rewarded  Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXLV  TO THE SAME  WE are removed to Castleberry Oh it was a gloomy and mournful greeting that I paid itEvery tree every book every chair figured before me as the  spectre of a buried joy Emma  enters the bosom and touches at a thousand pointsYet even in  this  woe there is a mixture of sweetness I would not be without it The mad metropolis I am told is just illuminated for success in battle The house of Corbett is an example of the reasons  either  party have to rejoice on this or on any similar occasion It is not an enemy that hath done this great mischief  it is we may truly say our late familiar friend  I enter the metropolis no more A few years only can be mine They shall be engaged in reconciling my poor dear Corbett to life on heaven's own terms and preparing for infancy an easy cradlefor age a smooth and peaceful pillow Berkley congratulate me My children are both well The bounty of the Almighty is still upon me  Oh friend receive my cordial blessing let your heart be kind your life be pure and  Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER CXLVI  TO THE SAME  IN the close of our correspondence on this subject receive the tribute of a tender tearful momentreceive an epitaph for Emma's marble The  little  Emma will I fondly fancy resemble her cherub mother at least I am hourly shaping her lovely features into imaginary similitude and when affection is looking for a likeness she either finds or forms it But whatever be the  exterior  of this dear  dear  legacy oh may her  mind  take its colour from the parent and Emma who is in heaven again give lustre to earth in the virtues of her child  ROBERT RAYMOND  INSCRIPTION  The Author of Emma Corbett is indebted for this monumental tribute to an elegant and tender friend  POR THE MONUMENT OF EMMA  AH pass not yet If thou dist ever know  The tenderest touches of impassion'd woe  Pass not if Truth and Fortitude and Love  Can stay thy footsteps or thy spirit move  Pass not if every elegance of soul  Can charm thy senses or thy steps controul  Pass not if more than Roman virtue here  With more than female softness claim the tear  Nor pass if heavenborn sympathy have art  To urge the thrilling pulses of thy heart  But if nor suffering worth thy soul can move  Nor the sweet impulse of a generous love  If fortitude with glowing beauty join'd  Knows not the power to captivate thy mind  If health if joy devoted to the tomb  If life laid down to ward a lover's doom  If patience perseverance ardour truth  Blended with every charm of female youth  If these and every virtue every grace  Want power to melt the soul upon thy face  Then  quickly passthis hallowed spot forbear  THE FEELING HEART ALONE SHOULD TARRY HERE  THE END
