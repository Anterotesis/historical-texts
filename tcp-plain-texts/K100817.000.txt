 THE PECKHAM FROLIC OR NELL GWYN  A Comedy  IN THREE ACTS  London  PRINTED FOR J HATCHARD OPPOSITE BURLINGTON HOUSE PICCADILLY    Advertisement  THE following dramatic  whim  having afforded some amusement to a small but polished and enlightened circle the author is tempted to offer it to the candour of a more extensive tribunal  Characters  THE KING  LORD ROCHESTER  SIR CHARLES SEDLEY  THOMAS KILLIGREW  SIR OLIVER LUKE  ANN KILLIGREW  afterwards Lady Luke  NELL GWYN  Servants c  THE Scene is laid at Peckham in Surry Where Charles the Second frequently resided With some select Companions  ACT I  Enter  NELL GWYN  and  KILLIGREW  KILLIGREW  THE King I find is not expected today  Nell Gwyn  My hero is gone to the Olympic games at Newmarket nor do I know when he will return  Killigrew  That is unfortunate for I understand that Sir Oliver Luke the formal knight who was created by CROMWELL is coming here to present a petition by the King's appointment  Nell Gwyn  'Tis very true  Killigrew  What can we do with this ragged remnant of the commonwealth  Nell Gwyn  I intend to keep him till the King returns  Killigrew  He will be a projecting rock and break the flowing course of our merriment  Nell Gwyn  Perhaps not I have been forming a scheme in the prosecution of which I must beg your assistance I mean to sacrifice this Cromwelian calf at the altar of Hymen  Killigrew  Who is to be the priestess at this altar  Nell Gwyn  Your maiden aunt Ann Killigrew  Killigrew  Impossible you cannot be serious  Nell Gwyn  I beg your attention for a momentAnn Killigrew has been invariably my friend Long before I was the Infanta's deputy she was zealous in my service she encouraged my propensity to comedy flattered my feeble talent and obtained my admission to the stage  Killigrew  But what has this to do with her marrying Sir Oliver  Nell Gwyn  Suppress your impatienceyou shall know in a moment My friend has laughed away years inattentive to her interest and careless of her income which like a glittering bubble glided down the stream so fast till at length if burst I propose that in this shipwreck of her fortune the Oliverian knight shall save her from sinkingThus I have an opportunity offered me of repaying her friendship  Killigrew  This is one of your whimsical flights an airy child of your creationa chimera  Nell Gwyn  No chimera I assure you Sir Oliver will most certainly apply to the intervention of my good offices for the success of his memorial I shall freely promise him my interest and shall intimate to him at the same time that a matrimonial connection with some royalist would smooth every obstacle to his petition as it would be a proof to the king of the truth of his political conversion  Killigrew  I allow that the avaricious knight will be governed by his interest but how will you induce the lady to connect herself with this formal old batchelor take my word she  will never relish a seast composed of such obsolete ingredients  Nell Gwyn  The person my dear Killigrew who waits for dinner till it is very late without having taken any intervening refreshment is not exacting or fastidious concerning the cookery Direct the application to Ann Killigrew and you will not I think despair of my obtaining her consent I hear a carriage it is most likely the knight with his formality and his memorial I beg you will receive him and inform him of my royal injunction to stay here till the arrival of his majesty As to the matrimonial negociation leave that entirely to me  Killigrew  Depend upon it you will not succeed in assimilating such incongruities as the formal knight and the laughterloving dame Ann Killigrew  Nell Gwyn  If I do not succeed the negociating part will divert me In the comedy of life as well as of the theatre I require some under plot beside the main designAdieu  Exit  Killigrew  Though I have nothing to do with the negociation I may perhaps be able to chissel away some rough parts of the moving statue  Enter Servant and announces  SIR OLIVER LUKE  Killigrew  I am ordered Sir Oliver to do the honours of this mansion and to welcome you to PeckhamMy name is Killigrew  Sir Oliver  I am proud to form an acquaintance with so celebrated a young gentleman  Killigrew  I did not expect flattery from the lips of Sir Oliver Luke but you speak the language of the country you now honour with your presence  Sir Oliver  There Mr Killigrew you touch the difficulty under which I labour To the language of Peckham its manners its usages its habits I am an ignorant foreigner  Killigrew  Do not be disheartened on that account we shall be happy to naturalise you among us In the first place I have to inform you that the beautiful lady of this mansion insists upon your remaining here till his Majesty returns  Sir Oliver  Business of great importance I presume detains him as his Majesty appointed me to be here this morning  Killigrew  My good Sir Oliver as you are not a shepherdess you must not expect the royal shepherd to be scrupulously exact to his appointment with you and as you are a going to be a member of the Peckham Club I will take the liberty of asking a few preliminary questions which compose as it were a qualifying test to your initiation  Sir Oliver  I am ready and proud to answer any question made me by Mr Killigrew  Killigrew  Can you Sir Oliver pour down a bumper to the King's health without coughing  Sir Oliver  I can assure you I am a perfect proselyte as to that ceremony  Killigrew  Can you bear the sight of a Bishop  Sir Oliver  I must confess Mr Killigrew that my mind still revolts at the lawn sleeve but I presume I shall not meet with any of that order in this mansion  Killigrew  Most assuredly not the Queen of Peckham is rather a diffenter in that particular she has no communication with the episcopacy  Sir Oliver  I should imagine it would be of use to me to study with some attention the royal almanack  Killigrew  I shall beg leave to recommend to your notice a court calendar that I am compiling in which you will meet with innumerable red letterdays and holydays but no saints some martyrs and scarce one virgin  Sir Oliver  You there gave a specimen of the idiom that obtains under this roof of which I do not possess the first elements  Killigrew  The language spoken here is the same as is used at Whitehall and it is a language acquired without much difficulty as it is not very copious for example we have but two vowels which govern our whole alphabet and they are  U  and  I  but  U  is always kept in slavish subjection to  I  Sir Oliver  I am not so dull but what I can guess a little at your meaning and shall avail myself of your instructions  Killigrew  Here then concludes our first lesson but before we are interrupted permit me Sir Oliver to make you an offer of my interest with his Majesty with whom I am in the habit of intimacy  Sir Oliver  My gratitude binds me to you for ever I regret it is not in my insignificant power to make you a return  Killigrew  Indeed my dear Sir Oliver you have it in your power to serve me I am now going to speak in the most undisguised manner and I must tell you that although I reside at Whitehall and bask as it were in the very rays of royalty I am sorry to add that no silver rivulets refresh the torrid regionno golden showers descend The pipes and conductors of the royal stream sleep in disgraceful reposethe playful fountains of royal remuneration glitter no more to the garish day  Indeed my dear Sir Oliver you have it in your power to serve me I am now going to speak in the most undisguised manner and I must tell you that although I reside at Whitehall and bask as it were in the very rays of royalty I am sorry to add that no silver rivulets refresh the torrid regionno golden showers descend The pipes and conductors of the royal stream sleep in disgraceful reposethe playful fountains of royal remuneration glitter no more to the garish day  Sir Oliver  I beg Mr Killigrew you will indulge me with a commentary for I do not comprehend one word of your text  Killigrew  I am at present like the rest of my brethren the courtiers not in a state of the greatest affluence and if I could obtain from your generosity the sum of five hundred pounds you would essentially serve me This act of complacency would operate in your regard like a magician it would immediately mature our commencing friendship and invigorate my zeal for your interest  Sir Oliver aside  What must I do with this beggarly royalist I must not let his intimacy with the king act to my disfavour  Killigrew  Well Sir Oliver have you lost the powers of speech I hope his Majesty will not take up so much considering time in granting the object of your memorial  Sir Oliver  I accede to your request and will in a few days supply you with the sum you demand  Killigrew  Which sum I will repay in as many months upon my honour  Sir Oliver  That is sufficient  Enter  Sir CHARLES SEDLEY  Killigrew  Give me leave Sir Charles to present you to my worthy friend Sir Oliver Luke  Sir Charles Sedley  The Queen of our society sent me here on purpose to have that honour  Killigrew  Sir Oliver this is the gentleman of whom Rochester says  Sedley has that prevailing gentle art  That can with a resistless charm impart  The soster wishes to the chastest heart  Sir Oliver  I am proud to take Sir Charles Sedley by the hand I know he is one of the most splendid stars of the court  Sir Charles Sedley  I am in doubt whether or no I shall be vain of that compliment for since Sir Oliver you denominate us courtiers stars it seems as if you thought our whole crowded constellation made at most a brilliant night since the sun of the commonwealth is gone down  Sir Oliver  Indeed Sir Charles I meant no such thing  Killigrew  Sedley you are too severe with my friend Sir Oliver acknowledges his past errors He wishes to be a convert and has chosen me for his confessor  Sir Charles Sedley  Let me also put a hand to this good work I think Killigrew between you and me our catechumen will soon acquire the necessary qualifications  Sir Oliver  I am sure under such professors even a scholar as dull as myself cannot fail of making a rapid progress  Sir Charles Sedley  And if you should not make a rapid progress it matters not since your masters take no entrance money  Sir Oliver aside  That is not strictly true one master has made me pay five hundred pounds entrance  Killigrew  Suppose Sedley we give our pupil a cursory knowledge of the current expressions in our society which are stamped with our peculiar meaning For example Sir Oliver when we speak of a Lady's monster we always mean the Lady's husband  Sir Charles Sedley  You will frequently hear us say such a Lady has a short memory observe this has nothing to do with the retentive faculty in general it only signifies that the Lady is inadvertent to one small unimportant article of the matrimonial statethat is to say the vow of fidelity  Sir Oliver  I am apt to believe the Ladies at Whitehall are not peculiarly gifted with memory  Killigrew  Bravo Sir Oliver you are an apt scholar  Sir Charles Sedley  If you should hear us by chance call a man an unicorn the meaning we apply to that term is that the Gentleman is possessed of a wife who has only once deviated from the conjugal path and therefore he is not entitled to the full honours of the fraternity  Killigrew  I think it is quite superfluous to load Sir Oliver's memory with that term  for I smcerely believe that among the whole herd of courtiers there is not one single unicorn  Sir Charles  We have other expressions which we admit though like bad coin they scarce amount to half the value they pretend toWhen any person among us says 'I promise you' such a thing we interpret that expresson into a conditional value that is to say the person intends to keep his promise unless some intervening objection should ariseIs it not so Killigrew  Killigrew  Most assuredly Promises with us dissolve as easily as snow into water when the sun shines  Sir Charles  Again Suppose a man borrows money of you and he solemnly declares that he will repay it  upon his honour  we explain that affirmative negatively  Sir Oliver  How negatively  Sir Charles  That he means never to return the money  Sir Oliver  Indeed  Sir Charles  You appear ruffled Sir at what I say  Killigrew confused  Sir Charles you talk a little at random in the last instance  Sir Charles  What the devil is the matter you both seem so confounded  Sir Oliver  I have no reason to be distrubed since Mr Killigrew tells me that a promise in the circle of Whitehail dissolves like snow before the sun  Enter  NELL GWYN  Sir Charles  Here comes the fair deity of our temple  Nell Gwyn  I make no apology Sir Oliver for not waiting upon you sooner as I knew you was in such agreeable company  Sir Oliver  Indeed madam these young gentlemen have been extremely entertaining and have also condescended to give me some instructions of which I shall avail myself  Sir Charles Sedley  You are too courteous any information you may have received from me is not worth the value of a groat  Sir Oliver  I ask your pardon Sir Charles your information is to me worth l  Killigrew  You affix Sir Oliver too literal a meaning to what Sedley just now advanced  Nell Gwyn  Gentlemen you must take another time to settle your dispute I beg you will leave me alone with my new acquaintance  as I have something to communicate to Sir Oliver of a private nature  Sir Charles and Killigrew  We obey your commands  Exeunt  Sir Oliver aside  What would our reverend Elders say if they knew I was têteatète with Nell Gwyn  Nell Gwyn  I am apprised of the object of the paper you have to present to a certain great personage and you may rely on the influence I may possess with regard to his Majesty  Sir Oliver  Your affability equals your beauty  Nell Gwyn  I must however inform you that my warm wishes for your success will not be powerful enough to persuade his Majesty to accede to a grant of such magnitude without some strong assurance of your being a sincere and contrite convert to the royal cause  Sir Oliver Emphatically  I renounce the Commonwealth  Nell Gwyn  Yes like the shardborn beetle that creeps out of a ruin But to throw off the veil of disguise I assure you Sir Oliver that nothing would strengthen your interest with the King so much as the entering into a matrimonial contact with some lady of the court  Sir Oliver  What young lady of the Court would stoop to a knight of the late Commonwealth whose age is fiftyeight  Nell Gwyn  There are ladies who have passed their meridian and whose years amounting to the number I'll suppose of fortytwo would easily assimilate with the number fiftyeight The two separate numbers thus coupled would summed up make exactly which union carries with it a good omen for it is the number that came up the first prize in the last year's lottery  Sir Oliver  I am afraid Madam you are bantering with your humble servant  Nell Gwyn  I never was more in earnest in my life I have a lady in view who would suit you in every respect She is about the age I mentioned displaying a rich shew of autumnal beauty attended by all the charms that affability courteousness sprightliness and innocence can bestow  Sir Oliver  You will forgive me if I interpose a doubt concerning the last article of the inventory  Nell Gwyn  Her innocence I suppose you mean  Sir Oliver  I do  Nell Gwyn  The last article of the inventory is as much her property as her other good qualities and it is an additional merit to have lived so many years in the warm climate of Whitehall without singeing the ermine of her innocence Lord Rochester frequently compares her to an isicle hanging over the mouth of a volcanoand take notice Sir Oliver that Rochester is of great authority on a subject of this nature  Sir Oliver  But this immaculate lady whoever she may be knows nothing of your humble servant  Nell Gwyn  I will perform the part of Cupid in this business I will lay the cornerstone of this new temple of love  Sir Oliver  If it was the first day of April I should be apt to think Madam that you intended toYou understand what I mean  Nell Gwyn  Indeed Sir Oliver if I had a mind to be severe I might say that the first of April need not take the trouble of coming for the purpose you allude to as it would find the work already done but I once more assure you that I never was more resolutely  in earnest The marrying a lady for whom the King entertains the highest regard will be the means the only means of promoting the success of your memorial The coming into a matrimonial contact with a Lady of the Court will be a passport to the royal favourit will like the waters of Lethe wash out of remembrance your original spot of republicanism  Sir Oliver  I begin to think you are giving me wholesome adviceBut may I not inquire who the fair Incognita is you intend for my bride  Nell Gwyn  I am happy to obsserve this youthful impatience in younevertheless you shall not know who your bride is till you are introduced to her which will be in the course of a few hours  Sir Oliver  I confess there is something romantic in all this which does not displease me  Nell Gwyn  You shall have reason to boast the power of your attraction The isicle which did not melt as it hung over the Whitehall volcano shall dissolve before the firebrand of the commonwealth Don't knit your brow Sir Oliver it does not become youIndulge my  frolicksome manner of talking no reproach no retrospective censure was intended Look upon me as your friendAdieu I advise you Sir Oliver to go into the garden and meditate among the flowers the persume of the aromatic tribe sostens the heart and disposes it to love it stimulates the imagination and tinges it with all the bright diversity of colouringTo the following lines Sir John Davies attempered his lyre in the days of the Virgin Queen  'Tis said that odours purify the brain  Awake the fancy and the soul refine  Hence Old Devotion incense did ordain  To make man's spirits apt for thoughts divine  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  Enter  ANN KILLIGREW  and  NELL GWYN  ANN KILLIGREW  It is impossible not to laugh at this mad scheme of yours  Nell Gwyn  You ought to laugh for you are the winnerconsider his immense fortune  Ann Killigrew  How came the knight so easily into your toils  Nell Gwyn  I led him to think that his marrying a lady of the court would be the only method of accomplishing the object of his petition  Ann Killigrew  But I beg you will give me a short catalogue of the qualities of my bridegroom  Nell Gwyn  In the sirst place he has the character of good nature as for his wit I have not much to boast of you my dear have enough of that commodity to serve you both  Ann Killigrew  How is his person  Nell Gwyn  His person observes a strict neutrality between invitation and disgust  Ann Killigrew  Well as long as he is rich and perfectly good humoured  Nell Gwyn  I make no doubt but your dexterity will enable you to mould this republican lump into any form you please I must however not forget to acquaint you that he made a very penetrating inquiry into your moral character and though he hesitated belief I convinced him at last of the purity of your conduct  Ann Killigrew  Indeed my dear I cannot but smile at the having you for a witness of my virgin innocence  Nell Gwyn  This witness however has effectually served you My friendship in this instance triumphed over all my suspicions  Ann Killigrew  I am obliged to your friendship but not to your suspicions  Nell Gwyn  Pretty innocent are then my suspicions groundless  Ann Killigrew  Though it is impossible to refrain from laughing at the arch look you now assume and the significant tone of voice you gave to the last question yet the giddy laughterloving Ann Killigrew can with truth assirm that your suspicions are not founded in fact  Nell Gwyn  To indulge that easy unrestricted flow of conversation which peculiarly distinguishes our friendship I must confess that I cannot easily comprehend how you have escaped every snare that art and ingenuity prepared for you in the younger part of your life  Ann Killigrew  You allude I suppose to the report concerning the Duke of Buckingham  Nell Gwyn  I do and also to the report relative to Sir John Suckling St Evremond Rochester and even old Waller  Ann Killigrew  I must own I had some felicitous escapes from these gentlemen I must however except against one person on your list I mean Sir John Suckling with whom I never was a favourite  Nell Gwyn  There are enough remaining on the list after Sir John is erased  Ann Killigrew  As for Buckingham he was very assiduous and extremely in earnest he  called upon me one day when he was a candidate for my favour at a time when in the heat of his canvass he presumed of his election He found me reading the poem of Absalom and Achitophel then recently published in which you know Buckingham is excellently pourtrayed under the denomination of Zimri I asked his Grace in what character he paid me the honour of a visitwhether as a lover a painter a chymist a fidler or a buffoonThis I suppose enraged him for he abruptly withdrew and never returnedSo much for Buckingham  St Evremond was also very pressing to obtain my favour He brought with him that refined civilisation that elegance of manners that playful converse that enamelled wit so characteristic of his countrymen He talked a philosophical jargon which I did not comprehend though it pleased me He laughed at the folly of the restrictive virtues and sent them all to Milton's paradise of fools But his ugliness unfascinated the powers of his eloquence my Guardian Angel sat astride on the large wen on his forehead and saved me from ruinso much for St Evremond  Nell Gwyn Laughing  I think your memoirs exceedingly entertaining I beg you will continue your narrative  Ann Killigrew  Old Waller used also to shoot at me but his bullets being nothing more than poetical sugarplumbs no mischief ensued But the most formidable battle that ever I was engaged in was against Rochester It was some years ago when he acted the part of a German conjuror in the city the celebrity of 'the German fortuneteller excited my curiosity for I had not the smallest intimation who it wasBut I tire you perhaps  Nell Gwyn  Quite the reverse I am impatience to hear the remainder of your story  Ann Killigrew  I dressed myself in the most simple manner in the  costume  of a village girl and stole away at night into the city in a hackney coach As soon as I was introduced to the venerable necromancer he accosted me in these words"My beautiful little rustic you will most certainly be wedded to the youth you love"To which gracious prophecy I returned a very humble aukward and cottagelike curtesey He added"I perceive however my dear girl that the stars will not consent to the marriage you have so much at heart till  you have made some other person happy first and the sooner you make some person happy the sooner you will possess the youth of your affection" He next put a Portugal piece into my hand then locked the door threw away his necromantic garment tore off his whiskers dismissed his hoary locks and suddenly the German Doctor was transformed into the gay the daring the amorous Rochester  Nell Gwyn  I begin to tremble for you  Ann Killigrew  In that alarming moment where was my governess She had run off with a Captain of the Guards the day before My three maiden aunts where were theythe three scarecrow guardians of the Hesperian fruit They were caterwauling round some card table Where was my poor grandmother She was at rest with my ancestors in the honourable vault of the Killigrews  Nell Gwyn  Where was your virginity  Ann Killigrew  Secure in the circle of six watchmen who broke open the door attended by constables who came with a warrant to seize the German Doctor under the notion of his being a spy I applied to the reverend watchmen for protection and they conducted me  through MaidenAlley to a coachSo much for Rochester  Enter  Sir CHARLES SEDLEY  Sir Charles Sedley  I have to tell Miss Ann Killigrew that her inamorato will wait upon her immediately He has almost finished his toilet I left him adjusting his new black perriwig whose virgin curls have never been kissed by the amorous gales He has been scenting his bushy eyebrows with the essence of jessamine  Ann Killigrew  Do you envy his destiny  Sir Charles Sedley  Upon my soul I think he is a lucky dog and I rejoice to find you are going to honour the married state An unmarried woman is an instrument without a musician  Nell Gwyn  A ravishing lute without a lutist  Sir Charles Sedley  Or as an old lady obseryed to me the other day'we unmarried women' said she 'are the roses without a thorn'  Ann Killigrew  But why Sir Charles don't you practise the doctrine you recommend You  are a widower but as you do not appear a disconsolate one why do you not resume the conjugal yoke  Sir Charles Sedley  It is my intention I look upon myself a  pierre d'attente  a cornerstone left out from a building to be connected with another edifice  Ann Killigrew  I really am of opinion the marriage state has several advantages  Nell Gwyn  Particularly if the husband be as rich as Sir Oliver  Ann Killigrew  I mean independent of that consideration  Nell Gwyn  It secures one from temptation  Sir Charles Sedley  From which one is never secure in a state of celibacy not even in a nunnery I have an old aunt a nun at Antwerp who is frequently troubled with temptations The Abbess proposed that she should ring the church bell whenever she was tempted to give notice to the community to pray for her and sometimes the old lady is ringing the whole day long  Nell Gwyn  Bravo Sir Charles This is a most excellent family anecdote  Enter  Sir OLIVER  and  KILLIGREW  Nell Gwyn  Sir Oliver give me leave to present you to Miss Ann Killigrew my most intimate friend whom I propose as an amiable companion for the remainder of your journey through life  Sir OLIVER  Bows offers to speak but cannot procced  Sir Charles Sedley  Sir Oliver I perceive is tonguetied with extasy  Ann Killigrew  I suppose it is incumbent on me Sir Oliver to express my gratitude for the flattering distinction with which you are going to honour me  Nell Gwyn  My dear Ann I beg you will not be rhetorical and attempt any flourishing speechAs the conversation of lovers affects solitude let me advise you to accompany Sir Oliver in the long shady arbour  Ann Killigrew  I certainly can have no objection to what you propose  Sir Oliver  I cherish the proposal and should wish to have some private conference with this lady Give me leave to attend you  Offers his hand  Nell Gwyn  Miss Killigrew I wish you a pleasant walk I hope my dear you will not stand in need of your friends the watchmen upon this occasion    Excunt  ANN KILLIGREW  and  Sir OLIVER  Well I must own I take a pride in having accomplished this business  Killigrew  This business is not so near being accomplished as you imagine Sir Oliver just now assured me that he would defer the ceremony till he had the approbation of the match from the King himself  Nell Gwyn  I am displeased to hear this It is quite uncertain when the King will be here And if the Knight should go from hence before the ceremony has taken place we shall lose him without hope for should he return to his roundheaded relations  Killigrew  They would laugh him out of conceit with this marriage  Nell Gwyn  I ask your pardon they never laugh but they will sigh and groan him out of conceit with this union and absolutely dissuade him from a courtly monarchical irreligious connection  Enter  LORD ROCHESTER  Lord Rochester  Queen Eleanor I am the most faithful of your subjects I find I am come to assist at a wedding Is it possible as I am this instant informed that you are meditating so incongruous an assimilation as to ingraft the savage oliverian crab on the luscious pineapple  Nell Gwyn  Even so But there is a difficulty which has just now occurred The Knight will not accept it seems of the hand of my friend without the King's concurrence or rather his command and as I do not expect the King I am afraid the republican bear will break through my toils  Lord Rochester  I have a remedy at hand I will ply him rapidly with the circling bottle after dinner and make him so amorous that I will charm from him a promise to marry the Lady tomorrow morning  Nell Gwyn  No no I have a better inventive head at a crisis that your Lordship As you have performed the part of a conjurer with such success suppose you try how you can act the King The Cromwelian Knight has no personal  knowledge of you and has never seen his Majesty it will consequently be no difficult matter to impose upon him  Lord Rochester  I am ready to perform the part you assign to me in this new Comedy as it is for the benefit of Ann Killigrew  Nell Gwyn  When the Knight is presented to your Majesty you will express to him your full approbation of the match and then I will attend upon the willing pair to town and desire one of the King's Chaplains to tie the knot immediately  Killigrew  It is a most excellent stratagem  Nell Gwyn  Sir Charles I beg you will run to the King's apartment and bring back with you the garter and the blue ribband    Exit  Sir CHARLES SEDLEY  Lord Rochester  But will not his Majesty be displeased at the liberty I am now going to assume  Nell Gwyn  I will take upon myself the whole impropriety of this transaction I am certain it will excite his laughter and the King will lament that he did not come time enough to be a partaker of the frolick  Enter  Sir CHARLES SEDLEY  Nell Gwyn  Let me invest your Majesty  She takes the ribband and gives it to Lord Rochester who puts it on  Now gird your knee with this little badge which I am apt to pronounce a whimsical badge of honour since if History speaks the truth it was invented in memorial of a young slovenly Countess who did not know how to tie her garters  Sir Charles Sedley Bowing  May your Majesty's short reign be a prosperous one  Nell Gwyn  Go you two directly to the lovers You Sir Charles inform the knight of his Majesty's arrival and you Killigrew whisper in the ear of my friend the stratagem that is carrying on and order the carriage to be got ready immediately    Exeunt  SIR CHARLES KILLIGREW  Lord Rochester  Do not be offended if under the sanction of my transitory royal prerogative I address you in a language I never dared utter beforeVenus has many Cupids which at once denote her empire and the extent of her benevolence  Nell Gwyn  For shame Rochester is this acting a generous part toward your absent friend the King If I had any pretensions to the title of Venus my Cupids should not be linkboys to thrust their torches in every face  Lord Rochester  I intended no offenceit was only my libertine way of talking  Nell Gwyn  The man who now possesses my undivided attachment shall ever hold undivided possession He is the final object of my wishes my home my  constant  residence I beg you will look upon my former frailties as stations in my journey to the abode from which I will never never depart  Lord Rochester  Excellently most excellently said You have long gained my admiration you have now conquered my esteem  Nell Gwyn  The esteem of Rochester I fear is a coin of doubtful value however such as it is I will accept it  Enter  SIR OLIVER LUKE ANN KILLIGREW SIR CHARLES SEDLEY  and  KILLIGREW  Permit me Sir Oliver to present you to his Majesty  SIR OLIVER  kneels and kisses  LORD ROCHESTER'S  hand  Sir Oliver much confused  This honour Sirethis accumulated honour most religious Sovereignowing to her Ladyship I ask pardon I mean Mrs GwynI crave forgiveness I should say Miss Eleanor Gwyn  Lord Rochester  It is impossible for me Sir Oliver to do justice to your elegant harangue by my own wordsso I will only say that I am happy to commence an acquaintance with you  Sir Oliver  Here is the petition which your Majesty knows I was to deliver into your royal hands  Lord Rochester  My royal hands will put the petition into my royal pocket and shall consider the contents at some other time and in some other place For business is excluded from this spot and only mirth and love are admitted And therefore I rejoice to find you are going to add to the festivity of Peckham by espousing my good friend Ann Killigrew  Sir Oliver  I am overjoyed to hear my intended marriage meets with the royal approbation  Lord Rochester  It meets with my most decided approbation and will be a strong argument with me in favour of your petition  Nell Gwyn  I told you so Sir Oliver  Lord Rochester  I hope before Apollo reclines on the lap of Thetis you will conduct the fair nymph to the Hymeneal Temple  Sir Oliver  Are your royal words addressed to me  Lord Rochester  My meaning is Sir Oliver that I hope before the close of day my friend will be entitled to the honourable appellation of Lady Luke  Sir Oliver  I am your Majesty's most obedient subject  Lord Rochester  If you please Sir Oliver I will write a note to my worthy friend Juxon the Archbishop and order him to perform the ceremony  Sir Oliver  By no meansby no meansby no means  Nell Gwyn  An inferior dignitary will answer the purpose as effectually  Lord Rochester  Why did Sir Oliver start at my proposal  Nell Gwyn  Sir Oliver is afflicted with an hereditary disease called the antimitralantipathy which time only can eradicate  Enter  THE KING  The King  Heyday what are you masquerading in the morning  Nell Gwyn runs up to the King and whispers  Lord Rochester aside  I fear I am going to be dethroned  Killigrew aside  This sudden arrival will put an end to the wedding  Ann Killigrew aside to Sir Charles Sedley  I begin to fear I must still perform as you call it the irksome function of a vestal  The King advancing towards Lord Rochester  I ask your Majesty's pardon I did not at sirst perceive you was here  Lord Rochester  I am this instant arrived  The King to Nell Gwyn  I little imagined the King would have been at Peckham before me  Nell Gwyn taking the King by the hand  Give me leave Sir Oliver Luke to present this brother knight Sir Charles Stuart to you  Sir Oliver  I am happy in forming an acquaintance with Sir Charles Stuart I presume  you received the honour of knighthood from his present Majesty  The King  I can't say I did  Sir Oliver  Then I suppose your honours flow from the same fountain as mine  The King  You mean the Protector  Sir Oliver  Yes Sir Charles Stuart  The King  My title does not stream from so immaculate a fountain my family is not under any particular obligations to the Protector  Nell Gwyn  Sir Charles Stuart you must not engross your new acquaintance for as I just informed you he is going to be married The carriage is at the door Killigrew and I will attend Sir Oliver and Miss Killigrew to town and we will bring them back in the evening bride and bridegroom  The King  I assure you Sir Oliver you are going to be united with the most amiable woman in England If I had not been unluckily yoked in marriage with a d'd Portugal merchant's daughter I should myself have proposed to her Give me leave Miss Killigrew to have the honour of handing you to your carriage  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  Enter  The KING Sir CHARLES SEDLEY  and  LORD ROCHESTER  LORD ROCHESTER  AT your command I retain the honour of being your Majesty's usurper  The King  I beg the farce may be continued till the bride and bridegroom are introduced Did not you say Sedley they were returned  Sir Charles Sedley  They are now coming up stairs  Lord Rochester  Is the reigning monarch or the pretender to salute the bride first  The King  The reigning monarch by all means  Enter  SIR OLIVER LUKE LADY LUKE NELL GWYN  and  KILLIGREW  Nell Gwyn  I have the honor of presenting Lady Luke to your Majesty  Lord Rochester  Allow me to touch these virgin lipsSir Oliver I give you joy  The King  Your Majesty is incorrectLady Luke is the dispenser of joy upon this occasion Sir Oliver you and your amiable confort have my best wishes  Sir Oliver  Methinks Sir Charles Stuart you are too free with his Majesty  The King  My dear brother knight you will perceive presently that I shall take a still greater freedom with his Majesty  Sir Oliver  In what manner  The King  I shall enter into a plot against him and dethrone him  Sir Oliver  Dethrone his Majestywhat blasphemy strikes my ear  The King  A blasphemy Sir Oliver to which your ear is not a virgin  Sir Oliver  Sir Charles Stuart I wear a sword  The King  Then draw it in defence of his Majesty whose reign will not extend to five minutes more  Sir Oliver to Nell Gwyn  Good Lady tell me what all this means  Nell Gwyn  Don't be alarmed  The King  I have no intention Sir Oliver of involving you in my plot and of endangering your life or of making Lady Luke a disconsolate widow  Sir Oliver to Lady Luke  How can you laugh at this indecorous language  Lady Luke  Look round Sir OliverYou fee every person in the room is laughing  Sir Oliver  Damn these Peckham jokes I don't comprehend them  The King  Sir Charles Sedley I desire you to ungarnish his Majesty    Lord Rochester resigns the Ribband and Garter to  Sir CHARLES SEDLEY  Sir Oliver  Is it possibleis it possible  The King puts on the ribband and garter  The King  Now Sir Oliver will you kneel and salute my hand  Sir Oliver  I had rather be cuckolded this very night  Lady Luke  I am much obliged to you Sir Oliver  Sir Charles  I would be obliged to him Lady Luke if I was you and take him at his word  Lord Rochester  And comfort mea poor dethroned monarch  Nell Gwyn  It is now time to put an end to this idle merriment I direct my discourse to you Sir Oliver and now inform you that the innocent stratagem which has been played upon you was my invention for the purpose of securing to my friend so honourable a partner for life  Lord Rochester  'Tis very true  Sir Oliver to Lord Rochester  Are you not Sir the King  Lord Rochester  For the misfortune of England I am not  Sir Oliver  Who then is King  Lord Rochester  Your brother Knight Sir Charles Stuart  Lady Luke  Indeed Sir Oliver that Gentleman speaks the truth he is Lord Rochester  and the person whom you imagine to be Sir Charles Stuart is upon my word his most gracious Majesty to whose protection I now consign my husband Sir Oliver Luke  Leading Sir Oliver to the King  Sir Oliver  Do I dream or have I lost my senses to day  The King  Not more at present than any other day but I trust you will indulge this Peckham frolic and I can assure you that your brother knight Sir Charles Stuart will prompt King Charles to grant to Sir Oliver the object of his petition  Sir Oliver bowing  I am your Majesty's truly devoted subject  The King  As the table is prepared and spread with a splendid collation let us sit down in harmony and goodhumour dismiss the servants and let the dumbwaiters who have long had the character of being very discreet have the full benefit of our convivial wit and merriment  They sit down to table  Lord Rochester  I perfectly concur with his Majesty concerning the advantage of dumbwaiters  The ease and freedom of convivial festivity is thus betrer ascertained with all the gay privileges of Commensality  The King  I never before heard the word commensality  Lord Rochester  It is an expressive word invented by my friend Sir Thomas Browne the celebrated physician at Norwich  Nell Gwyn  Is it possible Lord Rochefter that you should call that man your friend wicked profane man he wishes in his  Religio Medici  these are his very words "that we might procreate like trees without conjunction  Sir Charles Sedley  This is treason against the enthroned majesty of nature  Killigrew  What does Lady Browne say to such a contemptuous declaration  Lord Rochester  She like a loving wife obtained his pardon from the queen of nature on condition that he should make an  Aménde Honorable  to which it seems he has consented for he is the father of ten children  The King  As I am not a disciple of Sir Thomas Browne nor consequently a friend to the arboreal procreation I propose a bumper to the happiness of the bride and bridegroom  Lord Rochester  I second the proposal  They drink to the bride and bridegroom  The King  Now tell me Rochester what is become of your hebdomadal seraglio I saw lately Monday and Saturday walking arm in arm together  Sir Charles Sedley  Your Majesty will see them no more  Lord Rochester  I beg Sedley you will not say any thing of this affair  The King  Now my curiosity is excited I must intreat you Sedley to proceed  Sir Charles Sedley  I shall most certainly obey your commands and shall first inform my audience that Rochester in the plenitude of extravagance collected seven nymphs which he denominated by the days of the week The beautiful hours that draw the car in Guido's famous picture were not to be compared to the  days  of Rochester They were however not halcyon days Sunday Monday Tuesday and Wednesday were tempestuous Thursday was a peevish ungenial day Friday was sullen and cloudy and Saturday thundered like a scold  Nell Gwyn  Poor Rochester  Sir Charles Sedley  To conclude my narrative debts were incurred the treasury of Rochester not being adequate to the expenditure of the seven days Yesterday morning  horresco referrens  the whole week was sent to jail  Lord Rochester  Lazy extravagant gypsies they deserve their fate  Sir Oliver  Indeed Lord Rochester the epithet of lazy is ill applied it appears to me that it was a very industrious week for I do not meet with one  holy  day in it  The King  Bravo Sir Oliver I give you credit for that pun  Sir Oliver  I am bold to tell your Majesty that I seldom offer at a smart saying but when I do it is my ownI do not borrow from others  The King  You are then Sir Oliver like a country squire who lives upon his own farm who kills his own calf and plucks his own geese  Nell Gwyn  With your Majesty's permission I will call for a songI should wish to hear the Soldier's Catchthe words by Sir Charles Sedley  SIR CHARLES LORD ROCHESTER  and  KILLIGREW  sing  THE SOLDIERS' CATCH  IF some blood we have spilt  To compound for the guilt  In Love's camp we'll do double duty  Mankind we'll repair  With the leave of the Fair  And pay our arrears to true beauty  The King  Most excellently performed observe Sir Oliver as you have been a soldier the moral of the song seems particularly pointed at you  Sir Oliver  I am happy to see your Majesty so facetious  Nell Gwyn  As we have already drank to the bride and bridegroom I beg leave to propose my favourite toast  SIR OLIVER  looks at his watch  Lord Rochester  Sir Oliver it is against the canonlaw of this society to look at a watch  The King  I think Sir Oliver should be exempted from the rule it denotes no drowsiness in Sir OliverHis looking at his watch is the  same thing as looking at the countenance of Lady Luke but I give you notice Sir Oliver that if you look again at your watch I shall obey your intimation and adjourn the court  Sir Oliver  I hope I have committed no indecorum I am now all impatience madam for your favourite toast  Nell Gwyn rising  Every body except his Majesty must stand up while my toast is going round  Lifting up her glass  I drink to the Royal oak which when the hellhounds of rebellion were in full chace spread around its hospitable arms and sheltered from destruction the monarch of my heart hail to the Royal Oak  Omnes  Hail to the Royal oak  The King  It becomes me now to rise and make my acknowledgments to the company for the honour they have conferred upon my good friend the oak Now I will beg leave to offer a toast of my own which the mistress of the house can witness is the one that I constantly give  Lord Rochester  Then Sir your toast is not a woman  Nell Gwyn  I ask your pardon Lord Rochester it is a woman  Sir Charles Sedley  'Tis then a beautiful woman you frequently see before your glass  Nell Gwyn  No Sir it is a Lady I never saw in my life And as there is an interesting circumstance annex'd to her I humbly intreat his Majesty to relate it to the company  The King  I am very willing to comply with your requestAt that eventful period of my life when I was obliged to wander in disguise it happened that at the close of day tortured with hunger and overpowered with fatigue I adventured to approach the door of a magnificent seat in order to solicit the charity of a little food A young man who by his emotion appeared to know me begged he might introduce me to the respectable Lady of the mansiona widow whose name was Wyndham and who was impatient he said of the honour of receiving me beneath her roof He then led me into an antique hall where sat in an oaken richly carved chair the aged Lady A pleasurable air of affability illumed her countenance still did her faded check display a lingering grace a winter flower Then slowly  rising from her seat the venerable form advanced and thus she accosted me"Three sons my valiant sons were slain in battle fighting in your father's cause and at their side my little grandson scarce fourteen my lovely my endearing Henry fellSince that sad day oppressed with the weight of maternal affliction I have daily implored the great dispenser of events to remove me from this scene of misery but at this moment I thank my God that he decrees I still should linger on this side the grave for the purpose of administering some little comfort to your unfortunate situation The tear that now weeps down my cheek is not the effusion of parental sorrow it is the gush of wounded affection for my afflicted Sovereign" She then attempted to salute my hand which I declined and yielding to the warm impulse of nature with a grateful heart I threw my arms around her neck and weptI now pour a libation to the venerable dame  See Hume  Rochester  I presume it is now my turn to propose a toast  Nell Gwyn  I will tell you who you shall give  Rochester  I accede to your proposal  Nell Gwyn  You shall give us the Country Girl whose fortune you told when you was the German Conjurer  Rochester  How is it possible you should know any thing of that incident  Nell Gwyn  The confusion you are in betrays you  Lady Luke  I hope you did not seduce the poor silly Country Girl  Rochester  I scorn your idea  Lady Luke  Have you never seen her since  Lord Rochester  Never  Lady Luke  You have often seen her and have frequently spoken to her  Lord Rochester  Never never  Lady Luke  Suppose I tell you that you have been speaking to her this moment  Mimicking the Country Girl  Good Christian Doctor tell me when I am to be married  Lord Rochester  Confusion I recollect that voice Had I known it had been you  Lady Luke  However you will bear testimony to the innocence of the poor girl  Lord Rochester  Yes But not to her integrity for she robbed me of a guinea  Lady Luke  That guinea was well distributed among the watchmen who protected her  Sir Oliver  What are you talking of Lady Luke  Nell Gwyn  We allude to a disguise her Ladyship once assumed to deceive Lord Rochester  The King  I never heard of this frolic  Nell Gwyn  I will tell you the whole circumstance some other time  The King  Let me ask you Rochester if you have lately displayed any flashes of wit if you have uttered any  bon mot  worth being recorded without raising a blush on the female cheek  Lord Rochester  The latter part of your question is superfluous respecting blushes for though we live among the fair creation and may very properly denominate them flowers we cannot so properly give them the poetical appellation of  Blushing  Roses  The King  Very good  Lord Rochester  With regard to your Majesty's general inquiry I must own I have been dull and melancholy of late  Killigrew  Rochester was delivered of a tolerable  bon mot  yesterday We were walking Sir together and we met Shadwell the poet He accosted us and said"Gentlemen I wonder to see you abroad in such bad weather" To which Rochester replied "I believe you and I are walking from different motives I walk in order to get an appetite to my dinner and you perhaps Mr Shadwell to procure a dinner for your appetite and therefore you shall dine with me"  Nell Gwyn  I think there is as much illnature as wit in that  bon mot  Lord Rochester  However the bard drank copiously of the viny helicon till big with the god he reeled with poetic majesty into my carriage which conveyed him home  Sir Charles Sedley  Give me leave to inform your Majesty that Sir Oliver is stealing again a glance at his watch  The King  Then I'll keep my word and adjourn the Court    They all rise the King goes to Lady Luke and salutes her  Sir Charles Sedley  Are we Sir to follow your example  The King  By no means I am in this instance only Sir Oliver's taster Before we part I will repeat to the bridegroom four lines written some time ago by Sir Charles Sedley addressed to the bride  Were I Apollo no I would not chuse  The gay Ann Kill'grew for my darling muse  Let other nymphs the learned mount ascend  She should be Thetisand the day should end  Now I imagine Sir Oliver that you are Apollo here is Thetis and the day is endedAdieu  The King retiresthe Gentlemen follow  Nell Gwyn  I will now as your Ladyship's bridemaid attend you to your bedchamber where like a poor hare after various windings you will be taken on the very spot from which you sat out  Lady Luke  You never can be serious  Nell Gwyn  What has happened You appear suddenly depressed  Lady Luke  It is impossible for me in the present moment not to be agitated  Nell Gwyn  What does the spirited Ann Killigrew yield to visionary fears  Lady Luke  I beg you will suppress your jocularity for the present  Nell Gwyn  I will only add a few words more as we both have gargled our mind with a little sputtering of the Latin tongue I will disperse your apprehensions with a line from Martial's Epigrams  Poete non dolet  THE END OF THE THIRD AND LAST ACT  Lately published by J Hatchard  THE FOURTH EDITION OF THE WELCH HEIRESS  A COMEDY  IN FIVE ACTS
