SCENE LONDON  TO HER GRACE THE Duchess of MARLBOROUGH  THIS Comedy is most humbly inscribed by one whose work and wishes inconsiderable as they are should ever be dedicated to her noble family and who is also sensible of the highest respect for her Grace's merit and truly amiable character and who has the honour to be  Her GRACE's most humble and most obedient Servant The AUTHOR  PROLOGUE  By a FRIEND  Spoken by Mr SMITH  TO lead attention thro' five acts of prose  Where to soft notes no tuneful couplet flows  To please each heart each judgment eye and ear  The attempt how bold the labour how severe  Thus I address'd our bard who quick reply'd  With honest diffidence and modest pride  " If I should fail I shall not think it shame  " To miss what few have gain'd the wreath of fame  " This spot I deem the public treasury  " Where wits rare coins for general service lye  " Where critics strict examiners are plac'd  " To try each piece by that nice standard taste  " And what to public use may be apply'd  " Is justly sav'd what faulty thrown aside  " Hence 'tis the Poet's duty to dispense  " Each various vein of humour wit or sense  " Not miserlike to his own h  ard confine  " The smallest spark of nature's genuine mine  " But to the muse his grateful tribute pay  " And in the common mint his quota lay"  On this resolve he to your sterling store  Presents a specimen of untry'd ore  If any worth it bears assay'd by you  His private talent is the public due  And should it not disgrace your brilliant mass  Give it your stamp and let the metal pass  THE DOUBLE MISTAKE A COMEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  An apartment in Lord  Belmont  's house  Enter Lord  Belmont  reading a letter a servant following  Lord  BELMONT  MY compliments to the lady and I will instantly attend her Order James to bring the chariot to the door directly    Exit  Servant  The more I think of this extraordinary summons the more I am surpris'd at it Emily Southern my near relation at an inn in London and desires to see meI tremble for the cause for though by no means infected with Spanish jealousy I look upon it that the honour of every woman in my family lessens or increases mine  Enter Mr  Belmont  Bel  Goodmorrow nephew I am glad to see you up so early I wonder how the folks that lye abed ever get through the business of the day for my part though I rise ever so soon I am in a perfect hurry from morning to night  L Bel  I shou'd imagine sir that a little regularity might prevent your being so much embarrass'dMethod makes all things easy  Enter a  Servant  Ser  Your lordship's chariot is ready    Exit  Bel  That's luckyWill you be so kind my lord as to take me along with you as far as the Tower There is a wharfinger there who I am told is possess'd of an inestimable treasure a Roman ring made of iron which for ought we know might have belong'd to the mighty Julius himself  Enter  Thomas  Tho  Sir    to Mr  Belmont  the gentleman is below whom you desired to wait on you about the tulip roots he says there is a cargo just arriv'd from Holland and if you don't make haste the choice ones will be gone immediately  Bel  Was ever man so unfortunate Well my lord you see I can't wait on you at present but I beg you will not go to the wharfinger's alone nor buy the ring till I see it  L Bel  You may depend upon me sir I shall not even go within a mile of the place my engagements lye another way    Exit  Bel  That's well that's well get me my cloak no get me a chair I'll go directly to the man that has the macaw birds and the cocatoo's and buy me some of them immediately  Tho  The gentleman waits about the tulips sir  Bel  Odso odso I forgot was ever any poor man so hurry'd as I am  Enter a  Servant  Ser  Sir there is a man below that says you desired him to call with some fine shells  Bel  What shall I do Well I will see the man with the shells    going returns    There again I am undone my spectacles are at Margass's You must step to my sister Lady Bridget and desire her to lend me hers    To  Thomas  Tho  I don't believe sir her ladyship uses spectacles at least I should be afraid to offend her by asking  Bel  Not use spectacles and near threescore ha ha ha very fine indeed but come Thomas get my cloak I'll take a turn in the Park and then to the Cocoatree to hear the news of the day and peruse the advertisementsI have a world of business on my hands that's certain    Exeunt  SCENE II  A chamber in an inn  Enter  Emily  Emi  There lives not surely on this globe a wretch so lost so totally forlorn as I am In one sad moment depriv'd of friends and fame But what are these to the sharp pangs that rend my tortur'd heart for his unkindness who should heal my grief assert my innocence and clear my fame But he alas thinks meanly of me and in that thought the measure of my sorrow is accomplish'dI am a wretch indeed  Enter a  Servant  Ser  Madam the gentleman you sent to is below and desires to see you  Emi  Shew him in    Exit  Servant  How shall I tell my story how make my innocence appear  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  That I am glad to see you any where my dear Emily this visit will evince but I confess I am surpriz'd at meeting you in such a place as this when I who have the honour of being so nearly related to you am master of a house in London I think your billet said you were alone I now expect you will explain this mystery by other means than tears and blushesPray speak and clear my doubts  Emi  Innocence shou'd be bold my lord but maiden innocence is full of fear Pray pardon my hesitation I know not how or where I shall begin  L Bel  Recollect your spirits and be assur'd you speak to one who to the utmost of his power will prove a brother to youMy sisters too I'll answer for them when once acquainted with your person and merit will be your sisters also  Emi  Your kindness has encouraged me Your lordship knows my mother died while I was yet an infant and that my father married soon againFrom that unhappy hour I became an alien to his heart and person under pretence of education I was sent to school where I received the honour of your lordship's frequent and friendly visits and remain'd there 'till about two years sinceWou'd I had never left it  L Bel  Pray proceed  Emi  The taunts the cruelties I met at home are not to be describ'd 'Till about six weeks since there was a match proposed to me with the most detestable of men which I prostrate at my father's feet and bathing them with tears refused  L Bel  He cou'd not sure attempt to force your hand  Emi  Every argument was used to persuade every threat to terrify me into compliance but in vain During this time of persecution my father's ill health obliged him to visit Bath I was permitted to attend him upon promising to try to conquer my aversion to this hated marriageI promised any thing to gain a respite  L Bel  As you describe your situation I cannot blame youBut was it aversion to the match proposed or prepossession for some other object that ruled your will I beg you will be sincere Your blushes answer meBut go on  Emi  I do not mean my lord to hide a single thought sincerity is the fair garb of virtue and they who know no guilt need no disguise At Bath I  met a gentleman whom I had known at school his sister was my friend and favourite there and in my childish days he used to call himself my loverEven then I thought him as sure he is this moment the most amiable of his sex  L Bel  Poor Emily I begin to tremble for you  Emi  This gentleman renew'd his former courtship if I may be allow'd the term while my first impressions recurr'd with added strength He asked me of my father who absolutely refus'd and forbad me ever to see him morecruel inhuman sentence  L Bel  This was indeed severe  Emi  I received a billet from him requesting me to see him when the family were retired to rest My father had ordered every thing to be got ready for leaving Bath next day  L Bel  And you of course consented to this last adieu  Emi  He came and while he uttered the tenderest vows of everlasting love we heard a noise in my closet to which he flew and on forcing it open to our mutual astonishment a gentleman rushed out My dear deceived unhappy lover called on him to draw and casting a look of rage mix'd with contempt at me said  "Life is no longer worth my care thy perfidy has made it hateful to me"  I threw myself between their swords and scream'd so loud that it brought my father and all the family into the room At sight of him my terror and confusion redoubled I ran down stairs into the street without knowing whither I went or what to do The night coach was setting off for London at that moment I got into it without determining on any thing but that I wou'd not return and hither it has brought me  Enter a  Servant  Ser  Sir Charles Somerville has this moment alighted at the door and seeing your lordship's  chariot there begs leave to pay his respects to you    Exit  Emi  Quick let me fly my lord    Runs to the door  L Bel  You'll meet him that way Into this closet I will not suffer him to keep you long a prisoner    She goes into the closet  Enter Sir  Charles Somerville  L Bel  Welcome to London my dear Charles but to what happy chance are we indebted for your return I understood that you meant to pass a philosophical summer at your seat in the west in reading and retirement But it grew dull I suppose it wou'd not do Sir Charles tho' you have not made a very long trial of it I think neither  Sir Cha  I have not indeed my lord made the smallest attempt towards the rational scheme you hint at Thoughts of a very different nature have for some time past wholly occupied my mind and left no room for any thing beside but friendship and Lord Belmont  L Bel  Lord Belmont is much yours But from this sententious speech and that grave countenance I think I may without being a conjuror pronounce that the gay and lively Sir Charles Somerville is on the point of matrimony with some welljointur'd widow or rich heiress and that he is at this very moment making an exact calculation of the fortune he shall allot to his seventh son by and of that marriage lawfully begotten  Sir Char  Your lordship was never more mistakenSo far from it that I have bid adieu to the whole sex and am determin'd to quit England in a few days with a firm purpose never to revisit it    A loud sigh heard from the closet    Ha whence cou'd that sigh proceed  L Bel  Sir Charles I beg a thousand pardons but I must entreat you to withdraw immediately and request the pleasure of meeting you at my house in half an hour  Sir Char  I shall obey your commands but can scarce forgive your suffering my present intrusion    Exit  Lord  Belmont  opens the closet  L Bel  Emily She faints  Emi  Be not alarmed my lord the closeness of the place overcame my spirits I shall recover soon but is Sir Charles resolv'd then does he leave England immediately what have I said I mean my lord is the gentleman quite gone is there no fear of his returning one is apt to rave after fainting you know my lord  L Bel  There is method in your madness Emily but tho' I dare say you did not mean to trust me with the name of your lover be assured I am extremely pleas'd at discovering him in the person of my friend Sir Charles Somerville  Emi  He is indeed my lord the object of my hopes and my despair but to what purpose do I own my passion he quits his native land to fly from me  L Bel  Be patient Emilyfrom his known character of truth and honour I am certain he will do you justice dare you abide that test  Emi  Most willingly my lord  L Bel  The way to hope for candour from Somerville the world and me is by a frank confession Who was that gentleman he found concealed  Emi  By all my hopes of candour from the world of esteem from you and love from Somerville I know him not nor why or wherefore he came thither  L Bel  I must believe you Emily there is a charm in truth that strikes upon the mind like light upon our eyes'Tis irresistible Yet passion I will grant may cast a veil on either I therefore can excuse Sir Charles for judging wrong  Emi  Oh blame him not my lord appearances were strong against me but while we talk he flies  L Bel  Your fears are those of love but let them rest and be assur'd he shall not break the double toil that love and friendship spread to hold him fast But come my Emily I am impatient 'till I place you in a fitter situation and present you to my sisters  Emi  By no means my lord think how improper it would be for me to appear in your house or any where in my own character 'till time shall have unravell'd this cruel mystery Scandal has as many wings as tongues and in a few hours I may expect to be the general subject of discourse and object of reproach Besides you may suppose my father will pursue me and if under your roof I must be discover'd  L Bel  Your objections are just and yet you can be no where so safe as under my protection Suppose then you were to be introduc'd to my aunt and sisters who have never seen you under a feign'd name and character as the daughter of a clergyman a particular friend of mine they have often heard me speak of such a person who has been some years dead his name was Lawson  Emi  I put myself under your lordships guidance and shall assume whatever form you please 'till heaven thinks fit to let me wear my own with honour  L Bel  I hope you will not continue long in masquerade but now my dear your hand    Exeunt  SCENE III  A dressingroom in Lord  Belmont  's house Lady  Mary  at work and Lady  Louisa  with a book in her hand  L Mar  My dear sister let me dissuade you from carrying on this affair with Mr Freeman any farther if he really loves you and his family and fortune may pretend to such a match why not consult my brother who has an undoubted right to be considered as a father from having acted on all occasions like one  L Loui  You have very vulgar notions sister I suppose if you shou'd ever have a lover you will bid him ask your parents whether you shall like him or notpoor soul but is it aunt Bridget or uncle Frank he shall apply to ha ha Do you know my dear that as well as I love my Strephon if he were to say one syllable about me to my grave brother it is an hundred to one I shou'd detest him Secrecy is the very essence of love and like all other essences it will evaporate the moment it gets air  L Mar  I am sorry to differ so much in opinion with you Louisa but I can't help thinking that the most innocent correspondence which can possibly subsist between men and women becomes in some degree criminal when it is carried on clandestinely at least it must appear as if one party was asham'd of the other which you must allow to be a sentiment by no means consistent with heroic love  L Loui  Read read my dear and improve yourself for you are really very ignorant did you ever hear of a heroine in tragedy or romance who consulted any third person in the disposal of her heart  L Mar  I can't say I have read many of either but to such overweening confidence in ourselves I believe we are indebted for many tragical subjects  L Loui  A truce a truce dear girl and for this once assist me It is impossible I can refuse to see him this evening when he so ardently intreats it in your grave mathematical calculation he has been absent three weeks but that you know is three thousand years in a lover's calendar  L Mar  My dear Louisa I will tho' against my judgment to the utmost of my power assist you but if my lord should pass the evening at home I cannot guess how it is possible without alarming him or what is much worse making confidants of the servants to effect your purpose  L Loui  Give me your aid and leave the rest to me  Enter Lady  Bridget  L Brid  Your servant ladieswhat at work you are a most indefatigable creature niece Mary and sometimes remind me of those industrious maidens that work'd beds and hangings as I have heard my grandmother say for those mechanical amusements were entirely out of fashion before my youth was capable of instruction  L Mar  Your ladyship has given up your time to more abstruse and difficult employments the study of the learned languages but as every person may not have capacity or inclination to employ their minds in that way I look upon works of fancy as pleasing and innocent amusements  L Brid  They are perfectly simple indeed and of course may be innocent  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  Good morrow ladies have you enliven'd the Park with your presence this morning Louisa or staid at home on the rational plan of reading and working by turns with Lady MaryI hope I see you in good health madam    To Lady  Bridget  L Brid  Tolerable not exuberant I thank your lordship  L Loui  We have been quite on the domestic plan my lord and of course extremely dull  L Mar  We have felt the loss of your lordship's company who are generally so good to make yourself the master of our revels  L Brid  That's a bad phrase niece revels imply revelling which is a term indecent for so young a lady to make use of I declare I was turned of twenty before I cou'd be prevail'd on to pronounce the word jollity and then it was at the earnest intreaty of poor dear Mr Feeble that I wou'd give it utterance It was a dying request for he expired of a galloping consumption in a few hours after I had granted his desire  L Bel  As I cou'd wish to justify Lady Mary's expression I will for this once take upon me the character her politeness has assign'd me by making a present to ye all that will I hope both improve and enlarge the circle of your pleasures  L Loui    aside    What can it be sister I die to know  L Brid  Some improvement I suppose nephew in the Encyclopoedia there are many sciences yet left imperfect  L Bel  No madam it is a living volume I mean to offer to your inspection and I think a fair one 'Tis the daughter of my old friend Mr Lawson who is come to town upon business and I have intreated her to make this house her own  L Mar  We shall doubtless do every thing in our power to render it agreeable to her  L Bel  I will present her to you instantly    Exit  L Brid  Her father was a very learned divine and who can tell but she may understand the rabbinical text O if she can but translate the Lexicon I shall be quite happy  Enter Lord  Belmont  presenting  Emily  L Bel  I hope madam you will now consider yourself as in a brother's house and as another sister to these two ladies  Emi  If they will condescend to accept my friendship and esteem they shall be truly theirs  L Mar  We thankfully receive and shall endeavour to deserve them both by sending ours to meet them more than half wayFye sister why are you so cold Pray speak    Aside to  Louisa  L Loui    to L  Mary  She is vastly handsomeEvery person who has the pleasure or seeing you madam must necessarily feel such  prepossession in your favour as willingly to accept what you so kindly offer  L Brid  Very courtly and correctly spoken on all sides my lord but ladies the hour appropriated to the adornment of our persons draws near and I shall request the favour of this young lady to accompany me to the temple of the graces or in other words the toilet    Aside    I think that was elegantly express'd and must inspire her with a proper idea of my erudition  Emi  I shall esteem it an honour to attend your ladyship    Lord  Belmont  bows as taking leave  L Brid  Is your lordship also on the wing Come then you shall conduct us    Exeunt Lord  Belmont  Lady  Bridget  and  Emily  L Loui  There are some very odd whims come into my head about this girl sister she is quite a beauty nay seems accomplish'd too a clergyman's daughter that's the old story But in short Maria I begin to think this wise brother of ours has his failings like other men and growing indolent as they all do chuses to bring his favourites near home did you observe with what an enquiring eye he looked at you He thought he might easily impose on poor aunt Bridget and me but he is mistaken Was this his fine present  L Mar  For shame Louisa how can you think so badly of a man who has deserv'd so well Left to his care even from our earliest years what tenderness what delicacy has he not shewn both to our sex and age  L Loui  I grant the utmost but still there is a somewhat that strikes upon my mind and tells me there is mystery in this affair and I am determin'd to find it out if I can  L Mar  Indeed sister there is something very ungenerous in suspicion if the tenor of our lives cannot exempt us from censure with respect to this world we act virtuously in vain  L Loui  O for heaven's sake my dear let us have done with this wise discourse it actually gives  me the vapours and I wou'd tune my spirits to their highest key for Freeman will be here tonight  "Winds catch the sound"  L Mar  Positively sister if you abridge my morality I must insist on an abatement of your transports  L Loui  Well then  " Form'd by thy converse happily I'll steer  " From grave to gay from lively to severe"  Is not that quite civil now  L Mar  Vastly polite indeed  L Loui  But still this most important business remains unsettledLet me considerHave you a pocketalmanack  L Mar  Not about me but prithee why do you ask  L Loui  No matter he shall come thro' the garden by moonlight  L Mar  What whether the moon shines or no  L Mar  I know it will Cynthia's the lover's friend and lends her silver lamp to light them on their way  L Mar  Again in heroics Louisa  L Loui  I have doneHis letter says his servant will be here in an hour from my fair hand to receive his master's doomIs not that galant sister  L Mar  Yes but I dare say he does not apprehend your ladyship's sentence shou'd ordain the dagger or the bowl  L Loui  No truly I shall be a merciful judge his doom will not be death  L Mar  You seem at present a very compleat emblem of justice for in my humble opinion you are acting blindfold tho' you might see if you pleas'd  L Loui  Ne'er let that bandage from my eyes remove Which hides the faults of him I fondly love    Exeunt  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A drawingroom in Lord  Belmont  's house  Enter Lord  Belmont  and Sir  Charles Somerville  Sir Char  I Have now my lord frankly related to you all the circumstances of this extraordinary novel except the lady's name which I hope for her sake will ever remain a secret What the denoüement will be on her part I cannot guess but am determin'd it shall not conclude in the usual stile with me for from this hour I disclaim all future thoughts of a serious connection with any of the sex  L Bel  Is it possible Sir Charles that passion can so far triumph over reason as in one moment to destroy the good opinion of a character form'd on a long acquaintance You say you knew the lady from her childhood  Sir Char  My dear Belmont you have stated this argument quite wrong it was not passion that triumph'd over reason but reason that subdued passion I can now see nay feel what an abject wretch he must be who trusts his happiness in a woman's powerdamn'd smiling mischiefs allI will henceforth see and admire the pretty baubles as I wou'd a fine piece of china but no more attribute worth and honour to them than maleability to that for if my Emily cou'd deceive there is no truth in woman  L Bel  This is mere commonplace Sir Charles  Sir Char  By calling it common my lord you allow it the general sense of mankind which is no doubt founded on experience I am therefore determined to profit by it so far as to retain my freedom at least I think I almost feel the shackles I might have worn but for the old gentleman's refusalOh how I thank him  L Bel  Perhaps you misplace your gratitude I am not yet sure that you are under any manner of obligation to him  Sir Char  Certainly the greatest tho' his refusal then was daggers to my heartFool that I was I thought her what she seem'd an angel and but for him Ixion like I had embrac'd a cloud But why do I still talk or think of her she is not worth a thought and I hope to get quite clear of her idea before I reach Harwich  L Bel  Believe me you deceive yourself her form will haunt you fly where'er you will and for the same reason that murderers fancy ghostsfor I am persuaded you have injur'd her  Sir Char  What shall I not believe my eyes by heaven the consciousness of her guilt even conquer'd female fear she threw herself upon a madman's sword such I then was but 'twas to save her lover and my rival ungrateful woman  L Bel  You seem inclin'd to lay hold of the dark side of every circumstance but there is one you seem not yet to have attended to or you cou'd not think of leaving England immediately May not the gentleman you encounter'd in your mistress's chamber possibly suppose you fled from him  Sir Cha  That thought had quite escap'd me I left a servant behind whom I expect this night in order to discover who my rival was and also to find out what her father had done or meant to do with his unworthy yet too lovely daughter I fear he will use her cruelly my lord  L Bel  And can you think of that and talk of quitting England  Sir Char  Why faith my lord I have always look'd upon chivalry as a very ridiculous science and yet I begin to think it has its foundation in nature for I never yet heard of a damsel in distress that I did not wish to relieve her  L Bel  Sir Charles this affair is much too serious to jest with You have asked my opinion and as a man of honour and your friend I now declare I think your travelling scheme shou'd be entirely laid aside until this mystery is properly explain'd Notwithstanding your affected gaiety I am certain you still love this lady  Sir Char  There again your lordship is guilty of a small error only mistaking the past for the present tense say I did love her if you please  L Bel  Well Sir Charles grant you no longer love you are certainly a man of honour and must therefore think it incumbent on you to clear a lady's character which may possibly have suffered as much on your account in the minds of others as she has done in yours from this unlucky accident  Sir Char  Wou'd to heaven that I cou'd clear her to my own heart from all suspicion with as much justice as I can to the world of what relates to me in her whole conduct and behaviour towards me she was purity herself her soul seem'd even lovelier than her form and cast a kind of glory round her beauty which while it awed transported raised and chastis'd desireyet she is false  L Bel  I cannot think so  Sir Char  Be that as it may your lordship has convinc'd me that I shou'd not leave London for a few days within that term or never a clue will certainly be found to lead us thro' this maze I therefore will abide the event certain it can't be worse than what I fear  L Bel  I must insist on your acquainting me with every step you take You know you may command me on the most difficult occasions  Sir Char  I certainly rely on your lordship's friendship  L Bel  The moment your servant arrives pray let me know I cannot tell you how much I am interested in this affairI shall be at home all day  Sir Char  I shall call upon your lordship in the evening  L Bel  'Till then adieu    Exeunt severally  SCENE II  A dressingroom in Lord  Belmont  's house Lady  Bridget  at her toilet  Emily  sitting and a maidservant attending  L Brid  In what part of Albion was your father benefic'd Miss Lawson Had he livings in commendam or did he only serve a simple cureYou are abominably aukward    To the maid  Emi    aside    What shall I say  Enter Mr  Belmont  Bel  O Lady Bridget sister wou'd you believe it I am cheated impos'd upon to the last degree The man that sold me the bluebird with the scarlet head has deceived me it is only painted He call'd it the true bluebird of paradise but he is the true serpent of it and has bit me Odso I beg pardon who is that pretty lady  L Brid  Upon my word brother you seem to be verging towards the state of second childhood You act directly like a baby one moment purchasing toys and the next weary of them But as the great Mr Dryden observes  "Men are but children of a larger growth"  I hope you are an admirer of Mr Dryden Miss Lawson  Emi  All persons of sense and taste madam I believe admire his writings and tho' I by no means pretend to either of those characters I join my humble suffrage  Bel  Odso she talks very handsomely Lady Bridget I have a great notion she is very learned Pray madam do you understand coins  Emi  Not in the least sir  Bel  I am sorry for it because if you did I wou'd have treated you with a sight of my best Otho it has the true green mold on it and is so very antique  that all traces of the figure are worn out so that it looks for all the world like a bit of plain copper  L Brid  And so to be sure it is Pray brother don't expose yourself and interrupt our conversation  Bel  Why there it is now you don't like to hear any one talk but yourself Lady Bridget but I won't hold my tongue for all that I'll go this moment and fetch my Otho and the lady shall be judge whether it is not a fine one and if she says it is I'll make her a present of it to vex you  Emi  I must beg to be excus'd sir I can by no means think of depriving you of a treasure that wou'd be totally useless to me  Bel    aside    I am afraid she is but fillyUseless madam an Otho useless I must beg pardon  Emi  I only said it wou'd be so to me sir who am not a virtuoso and want taste to know its value  L Brid  This absurd conversation is an outrage on my patience which I can no longer submit to Pray brother give me leaveI should be glad to know Miss Lawson if your father bequeath'd you any ancient manuscripts in the Hebrew or Greek languages  Bel  O sister dear Lady Bridget let me enquire about them Are they much wormeaten O if I had them to present to the Society of Antiquarians I shou'd be enroll'd among the literati and be reckon'd a great man Dear Miss pray let me have them I'll make you a present of all my birds flowers and shells since you don't like antiques  Emi  I wish it was in my power to oblige either your ladyship or Mr Belmont but I really am not in possession of manuscripts in any of the learned languages  L Brid  But you understand them miss  Emi  Madam  L Brid  Come come you are too modest I am perfectly inform'd of your great erudition  Emi  Upon my word madam I cannot say I am mistress of any language being but a very poor proficient  in French and Italian which are the only ones that I was ever taught  L Brid    aside    I am vastly disgusted at her ignoranceHow cou'd your parents so shamefully neglect your education But I presume your mother gave up her time to the making of conserves and distilling of simples Not understand Greek 'tis an exalted language and all its ideas are refin'd  Bel  Now hang me if I believe she understands it herself But she is like the man in the play  "that lov'd and honour'd the sound"  But miss if you will give me the manuscripts I won't tell Lady Bridget upon honour  Emi  I do assure you sir  Bel  You will for ever oblige me missEgad she has the true Cleopatran neck and the right Grecian Venus' nose    Aside  Enter a  Servant  Ser    To  Emily  Madam my lord desires to speak with you in his library and sir there is a gentleman to wait on you with some modern antiques  Bel  Models of antiques he must have said you blockhead  Emi  I shall attend his lordship  L Brid    aside    In his library Poor illiterate    Exeunt  SCENE III  A library  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  I know not how to act in this affair if her father shou'd discover her being here I have no right to detain her This unknown lover too puzzles me much Somerville is positive he came to her and yet with what an air of truth and confidence she has disown'd him I'll make her think that Somerville is gone she may from that belief become more candid  Enter  Emily  Emi  I have expected your lordship's summons with the utmost impatienceHave you seen Sir Charles  L Bel  Yes Emily bur all my arguments were vain he holds his purpose and is this very moment on his journey  Emi  And does this wretched body still subsist after the soul is fled  L Bel  This is the language of romance you must forget him I have matters of more consequence to acquaint you with  Emi  Why did you not suffer me to see Sir Charles He must he wou'd have credited the truth and thought me what I am injur'd and innocent But at this instant he detests my name he thinks me false and strives to banish me from his remembrance  L Bel  Then do the same by him retaliation is held just  Emi  Never my lord he is deceiv'd and my poor heart now bleeds for what his generous soul must feel when he shall be convinced that he has wrong'd me  L Bel  That may possibly never happen or if it shou'd the time must be far off and we have not a moment now to lose I have received a letter from your father which informs me he will be here this night and that he comes in search of you  Emi  My father here and will you give me up  L Bel  You know I have no power to withhold you from him  Emi  I am satisfiedall that can now befall me is quite equal since Somerville is lost no matter what becomes of me  L Bel  I shall be very unwilling to give you back into your father's power as I fear he will compel you to that marriage you seem so much to loath  Emi  No sir that cannot be even at the altar shou'd he drag me there I will assert the rights of human kindnot all the world combin'd shall ever make me the wife of any other man but Somerville  L Bel  You never can be his therefore Emily let me now advise you if the gentleman who was found in your closet and has for ever separated Somerville and you be a man of honour and one whose family and fortune may pretend to you to turn your thoughts on him I really know no other way to escape your father's wrath and rescue your own character  Emi  Is cruelty so catching Has Somerville infected your humanity and caught you to insult my wretchedness Must I again repeat I do not know him  L Bel    aside    Her emotion affects me 'tis strong and natural she has again convinc'd meExcuse this little trial of your truth which friendship and not cruelty suggested  Emi  A wounded heart my lord ill brooks suspicion  L Bel  Pray pardon mine and be assur'd 'tis vanish'd now Your father's arrival may throw some new light on this affair the moment it is clear I will send after Sir Charles and possibly may bring him back Endeavour to be chearful and hope the best  Emi  My hopes and chearfulness have fled with him  L Bel  They may return even sooner than you think But let us join my sisters their conversation will at least amuse you    Exeunt  SCENE IV  Younger  Freeman  's lodgings  Enter Younger  Freeman  Y Free  I am confoundedly fatigu'd I begin to think that a man of galantry has but a bad time of  it 'tis the life of a seaman weathering storms and tempests to gain a port which one quits without reluctance in three days Well now for the delights of matrimony Egad that's worse for there we are weatherbound for lifeAye but a fine young woman of quality with ten thousand poundsYouth beauty and money are but sweetners they will melt however I am resolv'd to try how long they and my love will last for any thing is better than returning to post the books with old square toes that's certain  Enter Elder  Freeman  E Free  I am agreeably disappointed at finding you in town brother as I did not expect you for some time but it is lucky you are come for my father's patience is almost worn out by your long absence  Y Free  And so Jack you think because I am in London that I shall quietly return into the city and occupy my old seat in the comptinghouse but faith you are mistaken business to attorneys and mechanics for me I fly at higher game pleasure my dear pleasure is the business of my life and the only business worth following believe me  E Free  These flights wou'd be ridiculous even in a man of fortune brother but from you they appear contemptible You were bred to business Harry and a man who acts properly in the station of life he was born to is a much more estimable character than a coxcomb assuming the airs of a man of quality without breeding or fortune to support them You really make a very absurd figure  Y Free  I shou'd upon 'Change perhaps as the mercantile world don't deal in my way But come Jack shou'd I not even there be look'd upon as a genius who in less than six months have acquir'd ten thousand pounds having set out in trade without one shilling of capital  E Free  As I cannot believe that you have either parts or application sufficient to discover the longitude I shall not reason on such a ridiculous proposition  Y Free  Why truly brother as you observe I have never studied mathematics or the art of navigation much since I left school nor am I philosopher enough to have discover'd the transmutation of metals and yet this poor contemptible absurd brother of yours may be master of the aforesaid sum with some other pretty moveables thereunto belonging in a few hours if he thinks them worth his acceptance    aside    He must be devilish dull if he does not guess now  E Free  I shou'd be extremely sorry that so near a relation of mine had enroll'd the name of Freeman among the knights of the post  Y Free  Have a care Jack though you are my brother my honour sir  E Free  Don't debase the termHonour's the offspring of fair truth and honesty yet scoundrels sharpers worse than robbers use it Gambler is a name more infamous than highwayman has all his vice but wants his single virtue courage With such I may presume you are associated  Y Free  The violence of your temper Mr Freeman has warped your understanding there are other means besides play to make a fortune which since your plodding wisdom can't discover I shall inform you ofSuppose a lady of quality were to think my figure not quite so contemptible as you seem to do  E Free  Insufferable vanity  Y Free  You may think so if you please but it is a certain fact that there is a lady of high birth and beauty with the fortune I have named that is ready to take hands and begin a dance for life with your humble servant Harry Freeman  E Free  Then you have deceiv'd impos'd on her which is the lowest baseness  Y Free  Not I as I hope to be saved I had no occasion to tell her I was a pretty fellow  "for she had eyes and chose me"  And I never pretended to be any thing more rot me if I did  E Free  Am I from hence to suppose that you have acquainted the lady with your family and no fortune  Y Free  Pardonnez moi there was not the least necessity of informing her that my father Anthony and my brother John Freeman and co formerly sold rum and hops in Bishopsgatestreet and were at present promoted to the more profitable and of course more honourable employment of keeping a bank in Lombardstreet Ha ha ha  E Free  Despicable coxcomb I know not which you are the most proper object of contempt or rage can you be such a wretch to think of abusing the love and confidence of a woman of virtue and honour who perhaps has no other weakness but her attachment to such a worthless being one who would cheat her into beggary and ruin her merely to save himself By heaven if I can discover who she is I will detect your fraud  Y Free  Why faith Jack tho' you have put the affair in a bad light you have come pretty near the truth I own tho' upon my soul I love the lady  E Free  Answer me one questionWou'd you marry her were you in affluence and she a beggar  Y Free  Hum that is staring the case quire an travers Why I I I really can't tell But I am so confoundedly dipt Jack I can't pay at sight as I us'd to do at the Bank and then I am so hellishly afraid lest my taylor my milliner and frizeur should carry in their bills to my father that faith I can't help it I must marry to quit scores  E Free  The difficulty of your situation shall not be an excuse for such villainyif you act with honesty I'll serve you inform the lady who you really  are if she persists in her regard I will acquaint my father and have no doubt but he will make a suitable settlementher fortune is by no means beyond his power to give an equivalent to  Y Free  Ay Jack but if she shou'd fly off  E Free  Then sir I'll pay your debts provided you return to business and renounce the coxcomb In three days I shall expect your final answer and from that date shall esteem you as a brother or disclaim that tye In the mean time here is a bill to serve your present useNo thanks deserve my friendship and be sure of it    Exit  Y Free  Why what a devilish deal of stuff has this formal elder brother of mine canted out about honour and honesty Egad I might as well have read a sermon as I us'd to do on a Sunday evening when I was apprentice  "Inform the lady who I am give her up and return to business"  Ha ha ha poor Jack you know little of the world on this side TempleBar Tho' I felt myself somewhat aukward at some part of his discourse I thought he look'd like my father in a passion and I actually began to be almost afraid of himI am glad he is gone I have now three days of grace which I am resolved to make the most of and the worst that can happen is to close my books at the end of them  Enter  Ralph  and gives a letter  Ralph  From Lady Louisa sir  Y Free    Reads and kisses it    Corn wine and oyl Ceres Flora

and  Emily  are discover'd  L Bel  So then Lady Mary it is your opinion that we can love but once  L Mar  I believe my lord the general experience of mankind will allow that true love visits us but once in our lives  L Loui  Lord sister how you must be laugh'd at shou'd you hint such an oldfashion'd notion among the BeaumondeWhy there is scarce a man of quality in England who has not been violently in love with half a dozen fine women at least before he thinks of marrying and if every one of them were to carry off but a corner of his heart there cou'd scarce be an atom left for the poor lady to whom he devotes his hand  Bel  I am sure if that was true I shou'd have no more heart than a mummy for I have suffer'd love many and many a time and yet I think that I am heartwhole still and have as large a stock of love to dispose of as ever  Emi  You very possibly may have preserv'd your whole fund entire sir for it is my belief  "they never knew to love who knew to change"  Other passions sometimes assume its form and impose even on ourselves But the true the real flame subsists even 'till the lamp of life itself is quite extinguish'd  L Loui    aside    She talks very feelingly upon this subject  L Brid  True Miss Lawson I will not blush to own that I am a fatal illustration of this sentiment the redundancy of my regards for Mr Feeble even in the tomb shall ever make me decline marriageTo his memory have I consecrated my virgin bloom  Bel  Lord sister I never heard that you were in love 'till now and have often wonder'd mightily that you did not marry some learned man  L Brid  The delicacy of my sentiments brother forbad a promulgation of my passion tho' some years are elapsed since the dear object was no more  Bel  Ay that there has I'll be sworn'Tis at least fiveandtwenty years since poor Feeble departed and he was dying for seven years beforeThere's a fine antique nephew there's a true gem my lord  L Bel  You will pardon me sir this is but a very poor copy  Bel  Don't say so my lord you'll break my heart I gave fifty guineas for it and bespoke it three months ago  L Brid  Bespoke an antique brother  Bel  Yes madam bespoke it  L Bel  What then he made it for you sir  Bel  No no no he said it was the true original antinoüs and it might be two thousand years of age for ought he knew  L Loui  And so it may uncle if you can preserve it so long and tho' it may not now it will then certainly be an antique  Bel  I'll go instantly and find out the fellow that sold it to me and if he cannot prove my ring a thousand years old at least I'll give him a hundred strokes with my ratan and get my fifty guineas again    Exit  L Mar  My poor uncle has generally some violent distress of his own making  L Loui  O this is nothing to the grief I saw him in last year upon the blowing of a tulip which he fancied would be black and unfortunately proved to be red and yellow  L Bel  He like many others mistakes a passion for science for the knowledge of it and is therefore for ever liable to imposition But we have all our failings and let his pass I think Louisa you gave up your opinion too tamely I was in hopes we should  have a notable argument but your withdrawing has left Miss Lawson and your sister in possession of the field  L Loui  I have not courage sufficient my lord to encounter such odds even Lady Bridget joined them that was three to one but if your lordship will declare on my side I am ready to renew the attack and have no doubt of victory  L Bel  Come on then ladies all brave men shou'd engage on the weaker side  L Mar  If numbers can give strength my lord I fancy there will be ten ready to list under Lady Louisa's banner for one that will chuse to be encumber'd with the heavy armour of constancy which our champions must put on Come General Lawson rouse to the charge  Emi  If our friends are fewer madam they will be more sincere and of course like British soldiers braver than those venal troops that are ready to fight under all colours  L Brid  Permit me my lord to bring this argument to a conclusion by observing that young ladies cannot expatiate on the thesis of love without giving an intimation that they are adepts in the science which would be rather an oppribrium than an honour to persons not yet adult But if your lordship pleases you and I will support the argument in a Socratic manner and treat the subject as they would have done in the Athenian porch  L Bel  I must beg to be excus'd madam I am by no means master of the subject and propos'd it merely to hear what might be said on both sides Some other time I shall be glad to hear your sentimentsat present business calls me    Exit  L Brid  At your option my lord  L Loui    aside to L Mary    What shall I do to get away I must feign myself ill  L Brid  Come children if you will attend me to my dressingroom I may perhaps inform your understandings  with a lecture on la belle passion provided you do not presume to reason or interrupt me  L Loui  I am extremely ill on a suddenYour ladyship will excuse meSister pray help me to my chamber  Emi  Will your ladyship permit me to attend you  L Loui  By no means madam I'll only trouble my sister  L Brid  Here child lean on meThis is a precipitate attack    Exeunt all but Emily  Emi  Oh what a heavy task to wear a chearful face with a sad heartIt will not long be soWhen in my father's power I shall have leave as well as cause to weep Yet let me snatch this precious interval and give a loose to those fond sighs that rend my bursting bosom cruel unkindAh no deceiv'd unhappy Somerville  Enter Mr  Belmont  Bel  O miss I am glad I have met you the man swears it is a right cameo a true antique Lord what's the matter miss what do you cry for has sister Bridget said any thing to vex you I'll lay my life she has she is very spiteful at times tho' goodnatur'd in the main I'll assure you But if I was you I wou'd not cry for her  Emi  You do her wrong sir she never gave me cause to weep  Bel  Well miss dry up your tears I have something to tell you that will make you glad at least I hope so  Emi  That would be news indeed  Bel  Ay so you'll say when you hear it But you must not mention it miss I don't know how to tell it to her neither    Aside  Emi  If it be a secret sir you had better keep it still so  Bel  No miss you must know it and no body else O yes one morecan't you guess now  Emi  No really sir I never was expert at riddles even when my thoughts were free now they are all employed    Going  Bel  Pray stay a little miss I'll tell it you just now  Emi  I shou'd be glad to be excus'd at present sir I am not very well  Bel  That happens very cross now and yet I am in a hurry too I shall run away the very minute I have told youDid you ever see my birds I have a parrot that speaks as plain as I do  Emi    aside    And as much to the purpose I dare say  Bel  What do you say miss  Emi  Nothing that signifies    aside    I shall be teized to death  Bel  I'll reach that parrot by tomorrow morning to tell you that I love you and will marry youI have done it    Runs off  Emi  My poor ridiculous uncle yet I can't help smiling at his disappointment when he shall know his mistress for his niece    Exit  Enter Mr  Belmont  Bel  Egad she smil'd tho' that's a good sign I did not see her laugh before since she came into the house I have seen as pretty women that's certain but never one that had such true antique beauty When she is Mrs Belmont I shall have all the virtuosi coming to admire her neck and the statuaries begging leave to take off her nose but I won't suffer it No sir Mrs Belmont is indispos'd she can't be seen this morning you must come some other time for I shan't expose her to the eye of curiosity as I do my coins I'll keep one rarity to myself at least But I must take care that Lady Bridget don't come near her to infect her brain with dictionaries and romancesI'll go directly and take a house for her near the Museum and if I can but inspire her with a true taste for antiques I shall positively be the happiest man alive    Exit  END of the SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A drawingroom  Enter Lady  Mary  and Lady  Louisa  L Loui  I Begin to have a thousand fears sister perhaps his servant has lost my letter perhaps some accident has happen'd to Mr Freeman or he certainly wou'd not outstay his time  L Mar  My dear Louisa your watch and your passions keep pace it wants some minutes of seven but I cou'd wish from my heart that almost any accident might prevent this meeting I find myself sinking in my own esteem for being in the secret I wish you had not told me  L Loui  How can you be so illnatur'd Don't you know it was impossible to keep it from you  L Mar  That is indeed the best tho' not the kindest excuse you might have made for such a confidence But prithee Louisa how is this affair to end You cannot surely be mad enough to think of marrying a person that for ought you know may be a highwayman  L Loui  It is a great pity Lady Mary that your sentiments are so vastly confin'd But you have never felt la belle passion and I excuse you You don't know that from the instant we fall in love we have a power of endowing the dear object of our affections with truth constancy honour in short with every amiable quality nor do we ever suppose that he can be deficient even in the common acquisitions either of wealth or rank  L Mar  I am surprized that the repeated disappointments which such sanguine expectations have met with even in romance have not a little abated your ladyship's ardorBut here comes your hero and I for this once will act the part of a trusty confidante  by retiring to prevent your being interrupted  L Loui  O for heaven's sake take care of Miss Lawson and Aunt Bridget  L Mary  I shall prevent their coming near you by staying in the next room    Exit  Enter Younger  Freeman  Y Free  Your ladyship sees the happiest of mankind this moment before you since I am again permitted to behold that beauteous form and breathe my raptures forth on this fair hand  L Loui  You are vastly polite sir but may I not suppose that among the multiplicity of fine women you must have seen during your absence you may have met with one to whom that compliment might be more properly address'd  Y Free    aside    Sure he can't have heard any thing  L Loui  You seem to pause for a reply sir  Y Free  Pause madamI pause indeed with astonishment at such an uncommon instance of humilityBut if your ladyship will cast a look upon that mirror it will fully answer your unjust suspicion  L Loui  I can't avoid being pleas'd at my doubts sir since they have afforded you an opportunity of clearing them so politely  Y Free  The tedious hours I have been compell'd to pass in absence have been all employ'd in stupid business looking over steward's accounts and making leases which wou'd have been quite insupportable but that I hop'd at my return your ladyship wou'd kindly condescend to abridge my tortures and suffer me to seize that beauteous hand  L Loui  O Mr Freeman  Y Free  By heaven I cannot live a day an hour unless you promise to be mine lillies and roses bloom to wait your comingnow now my charmer name the happy hour O how delightful is a true love match Say at what time my chariot shall attend  L Loui  I am frighted at your transports I cannot now resolve  Y Free  Here let me wait then on my bended knee 'till you pronounce my doom  L Loui  Pray rise I  Enter Lady  Mary  L Mar  O Louisa my brother hearing that you were not well has sent word he is coming up to see you that gentleman had better make his way down the back stairs I will delay my lord for a minute in the next room but pray sir make haste    Exit  Y Free  And must I leave you undetermined Will you not suffer me to see you again this night May I not return the same way some hours hence when the family are retir'd to rest and there can be no interruption O speak my angel  L Loui  I am so terrified I know not what to say but pray be gone this moment even tho' you shou'd return  Y Free  That permission has given me new life and now I fly    Exit  Enter Lord  Belmont  and Lady  Mary  L Bel  I am glad to hear she is betterLouisa what has been the matter You tremble and look pale  L Loui  My nerves are weak my lord you know that's a common complaint  L Bel  It is indeed become too general but I flatter'd myself that a good constitution and regularity might have exempted you from it as I believe it usually has its foundation in late hours and want of exercise But we shall go into the country in a few days to remedy these evils  L Mar  I rejoice to hear your lordship say so for at this lovely season of the year I grow quite weary of London  L Loui    aside    I have the comfort to think I shall not be of the party  L Bel  Come ladies let us adjourn to the drawingroom I left Lady Bridget and Miss Lawson there company is good for you Louisa  L Mar  We attend your lordship    Exeunt  SCENE II  A street  Enter Sir  Charles Somerville  Sir Char  Where can she have fled my dear unhappy Emily But wherefore do I call her mine She surely must have escaped with her unknown gallantI need not then defer my journey longerI have bid adieu to happiness and her and 'tis no matter where I wander now    Young  Freeman  enters as from the garden crosses the stage and exit    Have I my sight or is it fancy conjures up this fiend By heaven that is the manyet sure I must mistake He came out of that door too Lord Belmont's gardendoor What has he rivall'd me in friendship as in love this is too much my honour is now at stake Lord Belmont must account for this proceeding for tho' impos'd upon by female artifice I will not be man's dupe    Exit  SCENE III  A library Lord  Belmont  discover'd  Enter Sir  Charles  L Bel  Welcome my dear Charles is your servant arriv'd Have you discover'd who this ignis fatuus this unknown spark is You seem disorder'd  Sir Char  My lord I come to you for information I'll be no longer trifled withyou must explain  L Bel    aside    He has found out that Emily is here who cou'd reveal itIf then you know the secret Charles how can you blame me  Sir Char  Not blame you sir but I will yet have patiencesuch mean clandestine doings are unworthy of your birth You wrung my story from me  to betray methink what a light I see you in then let your crime upbraid you  L Bel  By heaven I never did disclose your confidence nor  Sir Char  For shame for shame my lord wound not the character of manhood thus nor sink below my rage  L Bel  Sir Charles this is a language I am not us'd to hear but lovers like lunatics have leave to rail when the mad fit is on them I think her innocent and will defend her  Sir Char  You think her innocent you the abettor of her guilt her lover's confidant  L Bel  I blush to own that I have been his friend illtemper'd unbred man  Sir Char  I am not quite so placid as your lordship I confess you are the true French courtier my travels are to come Born and bred up a Briton I may be rough but am sincereno flatterer no false friend  L Bel  I even disdain to answer your low sarcasm but am most glad that Emily has escap'd you  Sir Char  I doubt it not but will not waste my time in fruitless altercation  L Bel  The sooner this is ended sir the better At six tomorrow morning if you please we will use men's not women's weapons  Sir Char  Name the place  L Bel  HydePark  Sir Char  You may depend on me But as that time or place will not admit of parley I now conjure you to answer me one question  L Bel  Speak it sir  Sir Char  If I survive it will be of some consequence if not it will be buried with me Who is the happy man that both my mistress and my friend have sacrificed me to  L Bel  Insolent man how should I know the person  Sir Char  In vain you strive to hide him from mewere he ennobled with all the honours majesty can  give he can't be rais'd above resentment and were he sprung from the lowest of mankind my Emily's love has dignified his meanness and made him in point of happiness at least far my superior Therefore again I do intreat you tell me  L Bel  There is something very extraordinary in your persisting in a request that is impossible for me to grant for by my honour I do not know the man whom you suppose your mistress has preferr'd nor ever heard his name  Sir Char  Not know the person whom I this very hour saw come out of your house by the backdoor that leads into your garden  L Bel  You must mistake Sir Charles it cannot be  Sir Char  Do I know you am I awake or in my senses If these things are true I surely saw him issue from your gardendoor his image is too strongly fix'd upon my wounded memory to think I can mistake the moon shone bright upon him  L Bel  You have amaz'd me yet still I think it is impossible  Sir Char  My dear Lord Belmont if I have injur'd you by imagining you to be this unknown person's friend therefore no longer mine what apology what atonement can I make  L Bel  Indeed Sir Charles you have wrong'd both truth and friendship I never had a friend I dared to injure or disclaim yet if it was not a vision that you saw you are in some degree excuseableyet why shou'd he come here  Sir Char  That is indeed a mysterybut as I cou'd not imagine he came to any one within these walls except your lordship I hope you'll pardon the frenzy of a man who thought himself aggriev'd in the most tender points his love and friendship  L Bel  Sir Charles your seeming motives for resentment were so strong that I can readily forget the effectsI hope we are friends againbut let the  conviction of your present error lead you to doubt at least the certainty of some former appearances  Sir Char  O my too generous friend let me be happy still in your esteem but banish from my mind all thoughts of love Her guilt is fully proved she fled that fatal night from Bath with her seducer Curses blast him  L Bel  What reason have you to think so    aside    'Tis plain he does not know she's here nor can I now inform him  Sir Char  My servant is return'd and brings this sad account he left her poor unhappy father setting out in pursuit ofI cannot name her my once lovely Emily  L Bel  In such a scene of complicated distress may she not have fled for refuge to some friend Why will you think the worst  Sir Char  O no my lord she had no friend to fly to for sure he is the worst of foes as well as villains that wou'd destroy her innocence I doubt not but the wretch may abandon her to want and infamy  L Bel  I cannot think that she is in his power It is improbable that a welleducated maid shou'd take so rash a step but on a certainty of marriage with the man she lov'd  Sir Char  I shou'd rejoice to think as you do and were there but the slightest foundation for hope wou'd gladly rest upon it But all my doubts are at an end I am therefore determined to quit England but not 'till I have found the man who has robbed me of my peace and Emily I'll go this moment in pursuit of him  L Bel  I shall be glad if you'll return and sup with me we shall be quite aloneI shall be anxious to know what discoveries you make I also will endeavour to find out who this same incognito can visit here  Sir Char  I shall with pleasure attend your lordship provided I don't trespass on youWe sleepless wretches are sometimes tempted to break in upon those hours the happy give to rest  L Bel  You will oblige and not distress me name your hour  Sir Char  Eleven if agreeable  L Bel  Quite so 'till then adieu    Exit Sir  Charles  If Sir Charles Somerville is to be credited what must I think Who cou'd that villain come to For such by all accounts he must be Emily continued in the drawingroom from dinner 'till I left it She scarce yet knows the way to her own chamber much less that through the garden and yet to her and her alone he must have come  Enter a  Servant  Ser  A gentleman desires to see your lordship  L Bel  Shew him in    Exit  Servant  Enter Mr  Southerne  South  It is so long since I have seen your lordship I am not surpriz'd that you don't know meMy name is Southerne  L Bel  I am very glad to see you sir  South  You were but a child my lord when I left London on the death of my first wife  L Bel  I am sorry sir not to have been better known to so near a relation Pray how does my cousin Emily I used to visit her often while she was at school  South  She is very well my lord and that's my greatest grief If she had died with her mother she wou'd have been happy and so wou'd I  L Bel  You will pardon me sir but that thought seems so very unnatural  South  Not at all not at all my lord she has been a plague to me ever since she was born and my present lady Mrs Southerne always said she wou'd be so And Mrs Southerne let me tell your lordship is a parlous wise woman and never was mistaken in her whole life at least I never thought her in the wrong and therefore never contradicted her  L Bel  I should be sorry to think Mrs Southerne never err'd in judgment for then my cousin must have verified this infallible lady's prediction  South  And so she has my lord I like a careful father as I was and in regard to her poor mother's memory provided a proper and convenient match for her my neighbour Winterbottom my lord a man pretty near my own age one that was fit to conduct and manage such a raw headstrong chit as she a discreet person let me tell you and a great favourite of Mrs Southerne's  L Bel  You cou'd not surely think of marrying my cousin to a person as old as her father sir  South  Why not why not my lord she made no objection to his years but truly she dislik'd his family and person because he was not a fine smockfac'd beau and cou'd not trace his pedigree up to Adam forsooth a conceited undutiful minx as she was  L Bel  I cannot blame my cousin's spirit sir her birth youth and fortune entitle her to a very different match but were she a beggar sir she had better serve to earn her bread than wed the man she hates  South  Very fine my lord but stay 'till you hear the end of that high spirit  L Bel  Whatever her conduct may have been sir I fear yours towards her has justified it  South  No no I was too tender of her when she got into the pouts and cry'd and roar'd I promised not to force her to this marriage but if she wou'd be a dutiful child and consent to it I wou'd take her with me to Bath she promis'd she wou'd try to obey me and in an ill hour to Bath I brought her  L Bel  And there I suppose she married the first man that ask'd her  South  Worse much worse than that she sent a fine spark a baronet I think he was to ask her for his wife tho' she knew very well that Mrs Southerne  had pass'd her word she shou'd marry Winterbottom and did she think I wou'd make my lady a liar No no I sent him a packing and order'd madam to prepare for Southernehall directly  L Bel  May I not presume to say sir that this proceeding was too violent  South  Pray don't interrupt me my lord and you shall hear how this gentle lady behavedAbout eleven that night when I was smoking my pipe I heard her squall I ran into her chamber and there I found the knight and another of her lovers I suppose tilting at each other I beat down their passes with my crutch the candle fell to the ground and before the servants could bring light madam and all were fled  L Bel  Have you heard nothing of her since  South  Not a syllable nor wou'd I ever have enquired about her but that my lady's honour is engaged to Winterbottom Now if you can assist me to discover where she is I'll bring a replevin for her and carry her home directly If Winterbottom will marry her soif not I'll keep her close enough to prevent her bringing any farther disgrace on me while I live I warrant you  L Bel  Have you found out who the gentleman was who fought with the baronet  South  Yes her maid Sally a forward young flirt like her mistress told the servants that his name was Freeman  L Bel    aside    Freeman that's something gain'da thought occurs  South  Now I beg my lord that you will send out immediately to all the inns and lodginghouses about town to look for Emily my servants shall go one way yours another and I think we can't well miss of her though London is hugely grown since I was here that's certain  L Bel  You may be sure sir that I shall take every proper method for the service of my cousin but it is  not by a replevin that her character is to be recovered though her person may You as her father sir are first bound to do her justice to call the man who has wrong'd her to a strict account and make him clear her fame by instant marriage  South  What I call any one to account I fight for her Not I truly I am a civil magistrate the law is my weapon and if I can reclaim her by that I will  L Bel  But what are we to do sir with the fair fugitive when we have recovered her  South  Even what your lordship pleases you shall be heartily welcome to dispose of her to whom you will for me Try if you can make a match for her suited to her birth and youth since you don't approve of that I had proposed But not a penny will I give to buy her a fop or a coxcomb or a title yet if either of those fellows she went off with will marry her without money why I'll e'en give my consent that I may he no longer plagu'd with her tho' I am very much afraid that Mrs Southerne will be angry  L Bel  You talk sir as if your daughter were already found  South  Why my lord if she shou'd never be found I can't help it but as I am come so far I'll e'en stay in town 'till the horses are restedPoor things they have not had such a journey this many a long year  L Bel  Sir if you will leave the management of this affair to me I'll act as if my cousin were my sister but remember sir you have promis'd your consent to the baronet if he shou'd again solicit it  South  Ay ay my lord he shall have her if he chuses to wait for her fortune 'till my death I must now go smoke my pipe In the morning I will call upon you and pay my respects to Lady Bridget and my brother Belmont  L Bel  I wish you a good night sir  South  I believe I shall sleep pretty sound for I am very weary    Exit  L Bel  And I no less of youwas there ever such a bruteBut this Freeman now we have found his name he must have more cunning than a fox if two such brisk hunters as Sir Charles and I cannot unearth him I will first try the ground at home and that immediately    Exit  SCENE IV  A drawingroom  Enter Lady  Mary  and Lady  Louisa  L Loui  Was there ever such a lucky escape Lady Mary  L Mary  I know not how to consider it in that light Louisa I am almost sorry that I prevented my brother's meeting Mr Freeman it must have brought on an eclaircissement which I am of opinion is absolutely necessary  L Loui  You are not in earnest sure you cou'd not be guilty of any thing so inhuman  L Mary  I think it wou'd have been rather kind than cruel  L Loui  O absolutely barbarous    aside    I fancy she is vex'd at not having a lover herself I'll not trust her any farther  L Mary  Our sentiments are so different upon many subjects that I am not surpriz'd they do not accord on this What objection can Mr Freeman have to Lord Belmont's being made acquainted with his passion My brother's tenderness demands our confidence and it is robbing him of what he has fairly purchas'd to withhold it  L Mary  How often must I tell you Lady Mary that it is I and not Mr Freeman that wou'd have this affair kept secretThere is something so indelicate in public courtship and weddings that I cannot bear the thought  L Mar  You'll pardon me Louisa if I pronounce it much more indelicate for a young lady to receive the addresses of a lover privately than if authorized by the approbation of her friends in this case her compliance might appear a condescension to their desires in the other it looks too much like granting an indulgence to her own  L Loui  Your ladyship has stated the case as you call it with all the wisdom and gravity of a lawyer I hope you will be married to a judge sister you'll be a vast help to him in his business and may save him the expence of a clerk But pray Madam Coke upon Littleton in the aforesaid case is not the young lady to be considered as the principal party and is it not quite as necessary she shou'd be pleas'd as any of her kindred and parentage  L Mary  Doubtless my dear but will the approbation of her friends prevent her liking  L Loui  Why yes I think it mightFor example were my uncle to recommend a husband to me he must be a virtuoso if my aunt he must be a pedant if my brother he must be a philosopher and if my dear Maria was to chuse for me he must possess every great and amiable quality have a large fortune and a title Now as I am not vain enough to hope for the last and have a mortal aversion to all the other characters I will e'en chuse for myself and then I shall have no body to complain of  L Mary  Nor toremember that Louisa  L Loui  I hope I shall have no cause but if I shou'd I detest compassion of all things I shou'd not like even to have your pity  L Mary  I am sorry for it because I'm afraid you'll want it  L Loui  Psha  Enter  Emily  follow'd by Mr  Belmont  Emil  Indeed sir you do me too much honour and I wish it was in my power to make a suitable return  Bel  Pray speak softly miss don't you see my niecesIt was only a little present I was offering to Miss Lawson You know my parrot Louisa  L Loui  Which of them sir  Bel  The handsomest to be sure niece do press her to accept of it  L Loui  Miss Lawson my uncle requests that you will not refuse such a trifle as he offers it is a thing of no sort of value indeed I think of neither use nor ornament  Bel  Not so despicable neither madam  L Mar  However highly you may rate it sir there is a degree of politeness in lessening the value of what we bestow  Bel  Circumstances vary cases niece there are some things we should not depreciate  Emi  I rate the gift so far above my worth sir that nothing shall ever tempt me to accept of it  L Loui  Bless me Miss Lawson you are the very paragon of humility tho' I confess I think you are right not to be teized with such a disagreeable animal a thing that by pretending to imitate human speech puts one out of humour with the sound of our own voice as much as a monkey does with our species I hate parrots and monkeys  Bel  Yes but you love fops and coxcombs don't you Let me tell you madam your tongue runs before your wit you don't know what you are abusing  L Loui  I shou'd be sorry to find fault with any thing you lik'd sir but I thought it was merely as a naturalist that you kept such a number of parrots I did not think it was for the pleasure of hearing them talk  Bel  I can tell you madam I wou'd rather hear them chatter than you  L Mar  Yet they sometimes cast reflections mal a propos as well as my sister sir  Bel  Pray ladies let me draw breathWas there ever such a couple of vixens    aside to Emily    Don't  mind them miss but consider what I have said I am sure it is intirely for your good I speak You don't know what a vast collection of pretty things I have and they shall all be yours  Emi  Where things are in themselves indifferent sir persuasions and temptations may avail but where our resolutions are founded in reason nothing can or shou'd alter them  Bel  Hush hush miss not a word more upon this subject I have a great deal of business upon my hands but pray miss do think about it I'll get you a very fine noesgay tomorrow I'll pull my paul diack tulip for you the root cost me twenty pounds but you shall have it Sure you won't be cruel to me now Don't say one word for I must run and you shall have the tulip at any rate    Exit  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  Your servant ladies was not that Mr Belmont that left you I suppose he has been entertaining you with some of his curiosities  L Loui  I think he is himself a greater curiosity than any in his collection my lord but I fancy he has a mind to dispose of them all together and means to give a bargain of them to Miss Lawson  Emi  He has done me the honour to offer me abundance of rarities madam but I am not disposed to receive favours that I cannot return therefore his treasures are all safe for me  L Mar  I fancy he loads his gifts with hard conditions and would persuade you to accept himself along with them Is it not so Miss Lawson  L Bel  I congratulate you on your conquest Emily your eyes can do wonders it seems and light up sparks in dying embers  Emi  I rather think my lord that Mr Belmont's flame is of that kind which dying fires emit to shew their near extinction and the faint blaze has but by  accident cast it's pale light on me any other object might have been brighten'd by the same glimmer  L Bel  You wrong my uncle's taste I have not heard of his proposing to marry any lady these five years Before that time he used to be generally in love twice a year and had his summer and winter passions which he constantly chang'd with his cloaths for the season  L Mar  I am surpriz'd my lord that among such a variety of mistresses he never found one that wou'd marry him his person must have been tolerable when he was young his family and fortune unexceptionable  L Bel  Be assur'd sister that was not the case but by the time he had brought the lady to think favourably of him he began to discover some imperfection in her Perhaps her nose was a hair's breadth longer or shorter than it shou'd be according to the exact rules of proportion a foot or a finger perhaps disgusted him on which he immediately quitted his pursuit and went in search of another model  L Loui  It is happy the men are not so nice nowadays or we shou'd never be able to fix a lover  L Bel  I fancy Louisa that must be at all times a difficult matter to accomplish a fine woman will doubtless captivate many but there is something more than beauty necessary to preserve her conquest over one  L Loui  Why so they say my lord but I protest I can't credit it It is impossible I think for a woman to lose her power while she retains her beauty  L Mar  A moment's recollection must furnish you with such a number of instances to contradict your assertion Louisa that I'm afraid the argument will drop on your conviction and I shou'd like vastly to have it carried on  L Loui  O never fear we'll keep it up but I won't admit of odds 'tis only with my brother I argue  L Bel  Well then I grant that while beauty lasts it will always have admirers But these Louisa are but pageants to a conqueror the triumph must be found at home in the heartfelt love and esteem of a man of sense and honour  L Loui  True my lord but that same beauty that causes admiration and attention in other men will necessarily preserve our husband's love  L Bel  By no means Louisa possession damps the ardor of desire merit alone can keep the flame alive and hinder every wanton gale from blowing it abroad that like the vestal fire must be preserv'd by constant watching  L Loui  By your account my lord a married woman has just as bad a life as a vestal if her whole time is to be spent in keeping one spark alive  L Bel  I will allow her task is full as arduous tho' more pleasing Men are naturally inconstant and a husband may sometimes see a woman fairer than his wife but 'tis her fault if in the whole circle he can find one that so well deserves his love whose temper manners conduct and behaviour are so much suited to his sentiments who knows no wish or will but to please himthese charms the homeliest woman may acquire without them the fairest form that ever struck our eyes cannot retain one heart  L Mar  Indeed my lord we are vastly obliged to you for this excellent lesson and ought to think ourselves extremely happy in such a sensible and kind instructor  L Bel  You make me so as I hope that these slight hints I have thrown out may be of use to you But why so grave Miss Lawson I hope I have not made you melancholy  Emi  I have heard your lordship with the utmost pleasure and most sincerely wish that my whole sex had done so too  L Loui  I think tho' we ought not to wish that the other sex had heard his lordship it wou'd make some of them horridly insolent  L Bel  Be assur'd Louisa that I have only spoke the general opinion of every rational man But a truce with the subject for I flatter myself you have no need of any other monitor but your own sense and virtue Pray Miss Lawson do you know a Mr Freeman  Emi  No my lord  L Bel  She seems not at all embarrass'd    Aside  L Loui    aside to Lady  Mary  What can he mean  L Bel  Is he of your acquaintance Lady Mary Or of yours Louisa  L Mar  I am not at all acquainted with him my lord  L Loui  One knows such a number of people by meeting them in public that it is impossible to remember names we might perhaps have met such a person at Soho or at Almack's Sister shall we go see my aunt I think some one said she was not wellWill you come Miss Lawson  Emi  I'll wait on your ladyship    Exeunt Lady  Mary  and Lady  Louisa  L Bel  Stop a moment Emily I have but just time to tell you that your father is arriv'd and I have seen him  Emi  Is he in health my lord I greatly fear this hasty journey may have injur'd him that wou'd compleat my wretchedness  L Bel  Quiet your fears he is in perfect health and has promis'd to give his consent to your marrying Sir Charles Somerville or in short whomever else you please  Emi  How happy wou'd this kindness once have made me now 'tis an aggravation of my sorrow and comes like a reprieve when execution's past Yet still I thank my father he will not press me then to the detested march he once propos'd O let me fly to him my lord and on these trembling knees receive his blessing  L Bel  You must not think of seeing him this night tomorrow he'll be here that's time enough I flatter myself that a very little time will serve to clear this mystery  Emi  O grant it heaven let my poor heart be eas'd of this sad load which even imputed guilt can cause and conscious innocence but ill sustain then let me yield that heart to undivided and unceasing sorrow for my lost Somerville  L Bel  Dry up your tears he may not yet be lost I now intreat you will for a little time be guided by me I wou'd not have you suffer my sisters to perceive any change in your looks tho' I hope there will soon be a material one in your situation  Emi  I shall endeavour to obey your lordship    Exit  L Bel  What am I now to think that Emily's innocent I must believe I took her on a sudden unprepar'd and yet she answer'd with such calm indifference as common questions usually produce I'll keep a watchful eye upon Louisa she was not calm nor did she answer fairly to the questionI fear the stain comes nearer than I thought and yet I cannot think so meanly of my conduct towards her as to suppose she fears me why then shou'd she conceal the most important action of her life from her sincerest friend  But men and women both have their capri    We deal too hardly when we call it vice    Exit  END of the THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  Young  Freeman  's lodgings he is

three days are out This wou'd be enough to hurt a man's credit in the city and why it shou'd not be deem'd a mark of insolvency at this end of the town I can't conceive  E Free  As you seem to think a citizen has no ideas but what relate to trade I shall upon your own premises explain my visit When we have but a slight  opinion of our debtor and find him tardy we think it necessary to observe his motions but where a man of honour is concerned tho' we may doubt his power we don't suspect his principles and therefore never watch his motions  Y Free  Which is in plain English to say you look upon me as a scoundrelVotre serviteur tres humble  E Free  You have drawn this sarcasm upon yourself by presuming too hastily to explain my motives for this visit the irksomness of which gives but a bad idea of your integrity Those who act fairly need not fear inspection  Y Free  Indeed brother you seem to me quite on the  qui vive  always in a disposition to quarrel which is a mighty improper temper of mind to visit a lover in who shou'd be all tun'd to harmony and joy  E Free  The mind shou'd be at peace within itself to feel those charming sensations they must arise from conscious worthnot even

time to answer your  why's and your wherefores but if it will satisfy you I did wait on the lady this very evening and am by her appointment to see her again this night I then hope to prevail on her

pleasure there is in regularity Yet many men rather than take the trouble of settling their accounts suffer their fortunes to moulder thro' their hands without enjoyment and scarce find themselves in possession of an estate before they feel the loss of it I have a noble surplus now for exigencies I mean those of others more than my own For the man whose oeconomy is properly regulated seldom feels the force of that sharp word and I would treasure up my wealth in acts of liberality  Enter a  Servant  Serv  Mr Southerne is come again to wait upon your lordship  L Bel  Desire him to walk in    Exit  Servant  What can provoke him to return at this hour I hoped he wou'd have allowed both himself and me to rest this night  Enter Mr  Southerne  South  Finding myself comfortably refreshed after my pipe and tankard my lord and John having informed me that the horses are in good heart and able to set out tomorrow I thought it was as good to pay my respects to my brother and sister Belmont to night as to lose another day in compliments Therefore if you please I'll wait on them directly and take my leave  L Bel  It shall be as you please sir but I am surprized how you can think of leaving town 'till you have found your daughter  South  Why look'e my lord I am an old man and have no time to lose from the comforts of life It is uncertain whether ever Emily may be found and I want to get home to my own dear who will nourish and cherish me However if you think there is any chance of finding my daughter I don't much care if I stay one day longer  L Bel  That is all I ask sir  South  Well then my lord I will bide at your request and the horses will be the better for it And since I don't go out of town in the morning if it is agreeable I'll stay and sup with your lordship  L Bel  I am sorry sir I happen to be engaged but am certain that Lady Bridget and Mr Belmont will be glad of your company I will acquaint them you are here and return immediately to conduct you to them    aside    I must take care that Emily be not seen    Exit  South  What a deal of fuss and ceremony is here Cou'd not he let me go with him But as he has no wife may be he is gone to order something for supper as I used to do when I was a widower Ah I wish I had continued so still and then I need not be afraid of any body My nephew is a wise man that's certain  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  I am ready now sir to attend you but must entreat you will not mention Emily's misfortune to my aunt or sisters  South  Come then my lord and since you desire it I will not    Exeunt  SCENE III  A drawingroom  Enter Lady  Bridget  Lady  Mary  and Lady  Louisa  L Brid  I am doubtful whether I shall recollect Mr Southerne it is a good many years since I have seen him and I was at that aera extremely young in my infantine state as I may say  Enter Lord  Belmont  and Mr  Southerne  South  Your servant sister you look purely faith not a whit alter'd my poor first wife was a great deal younger than you and yet she is gone but we must all go one time or other they say  L Bel  My sisters sir    Presents Lady  Mary  and Lady  Louisa  South  Good pretty girls my nieces are the shortest of them is something like my wife when she was her age do you remember your aunt young lady  L Loui  No sir I don't believe I ever saw her  South  Perhaps notWell Sister Biddy and are you jolly old girl You thrive rarely  L Brid  Your phrase is somewhat of the coarsest Mr Southerne  South  Why yes we all grow coarse as we grow old to be sure I do remember when you were almost as slender as that young miss there But where's my brother Belmont the philosopher as we us'd to call him Is he poking after cockleshells and old bits of copper still my lord  L Bel  My uncle sir is true to his former tastebut I suppose they have not acquainted him with your being here I'll send to let him know it You'll be so good as to excuse me sir as I am engag'd Ladies good night I leave Mr Southerne in your charge pray take care of him    Exit  L Loui    aside    He sups abroad that's lucky  L Mar  What do you say sister  L Loui  Not material  L Mar  Pray sir have not you a daughter by my aunt A very accomplish'd young lady I have heard my brother say  South  Yes yes madam I have a daughter and she ought to be accomplish'd as you call it she has cost me many a fair pound she was no less than ten years at a boardingschool  L Loui  Was not that rather too long sir to let a young lady remain out of her father's house She must have been a perfect stranger to you  South  Why truly madam so she was but Mrs Southerne said it was for her good and one must give up a great deal for the sake of one's children you know  L Brid  I am surpriz'd Mr Southerne you did not think proper to present Miss Southerne's duty to me nor her respects to these young ladies her cousins in this you have certainly been deficient sir  South  Why really sister as neither you or they ever set eyes on her I can't say I thought it of any great consequence  L Brid  Notwithstanding our mutual misfortune in that case sir proper decorum shou'd be observed But I shall not on this occasion enter into any  contest of sarcasm  or  reciprocation of smartness  Enter Mr  Belmont  Bel  Brother Southerne I am very glad to see you how does my niece and your wife and all your children Egad you are a fine old Grecian and wou'd make a very curious bust it might pass for an antique will you sit to Rysbrack for me  South  As to the latter part of your discourse Brother Belmont I don't thoroughly understand it but as to my wife and children they are very well and I am glad to see you so  Bel  Pray Lady Mary where is Miss Lawson  L Mary  In her chamber sir I have not seen her some time  Bel  Ay ay I guessed it some of ye have vexed her I found her crying to day ready to break her heart I suppose this is your doings Lady Bridget  L Brid  Certainly my poor brother is seized with a delirium to suppose it possible for me to transgress the laws of urbanity and hospitality in any instance  L Loui  Surely sir you must mistake  Bel  No madam I do not mistake I am in my senses tho' so many teizing contradicting women are enough to put a man beside himself  L Mar  Pray Brother Belmont who may this same lady be I don't remember any of your family of that name  L Brid  She is no way allied to us sir either by affinity or consanguinity  Bel  You can't tell but she may  L Brid  You'll pardon me brother I do affirm she is not of our family  Bel  Then I do affirm she is for she lives in the house and she may be nearer to you than you imagine  L Brid  His senses are quite gone  South  Faith I think so for he seems to me as if he had some thoughts of marrying  L Loui  No no my dear uncle is not quite so mad sir  Bel  Don't be too sure of that my lady malapert I hope I am old enough to take care of myself without your advice or instruction madam  L Brid  Don't oppose his insanity irritation may augment it  Bel  By Hercules Farnese Lady Bridget if you don't leave off your tricks you'll put me in a devilish passion and you had better be quiet let me tell you  South  For my part I don't understand all this I know not who is mad or sober among ye I think ye are all at a game of cross purposes and I wish I was safe in the country again  Enter a  Servant  Serv  Please your ladyship supper is served  Bel  Is Miss Lawson in the parlour  Serv  No sir she is not well and desires to be excused  Bel  Oh now 'tis plain that you have made her sick somehow or other among yebut I'll go comfort her as soon as supper is over  SCENE IV  Another apartment  Enter  Emily  with a book in her hand  Emi  Reading's a charming exercise for minds at peace books can even smooth affliction's furrow'd cheek or change the source and channel of our tears from selfish to humane but when the mind is torn with doubts and fears while mad contending passions labour in the breast reason itself must fail to calm their discord nor can the powers of eloquence or musick attune the soul to peace or harmony  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  Emily I thank you for the condescension you have shewn to my request unknowing of the cause  Emi  Your lordship's commands were rather an indulgence than a force upon my wishes I therefore claim no merit from obedience  L Bel  Your father is at present in this house which will account to you for your confinement  Emi  My father in the house Will you not suffer me to see him sir O let me fly to him and give a loose to that soft sorrow that overpowers my heart  L Bel  No Emily for a little time you have promis'd to be rul'd I think you want not sense or virtue to conduct yourself but as I hope that by tomorrow we shall be able to clear up this dark scene which has perplex'd us I wish you for the present to remain conceal'd if my scheme shou'd fail I then will give the reins into your hands and suffer you to guide them  Emi  It is an office I do not wish forby nature and by providence design'd our helpless sex's strength lies in dependance and where we are so blest to meet with generous natures our servitude is empire to such a state I once aspir'd but Somerville is gone how lost my hopes of happiness  L Bel  Do not despair Emily you may possibly be nearer the completion of your wishes than you imagine mean while rest assur'd of every thing in the power of true friendship to alleviate your distress  Emi  An honest heart my lord is always grateful but when oppress'd with obligations it may want the power of utterance I cannot thank you but I feel your kindness  L Bel  My dear Emily I am sorry to leave you in this dejected mood but I have two gentlemen to meet me upon business I must therefore wish you a good night and hope tomorrow's sun will dispel those clouds that hang at present on your fame and mind    Exit  Emi  Let the bright radiance of unerring truth shine forth on Emily's every thought and action and pity not reproach will then attend her    Exit  SCENE V  Lord  Belmont  's library  Enter Elder  Freeman  and a  Servant  Serv  I shall let my lord know you are here sir    Exit  E Free  What an amiable man is Lord Belmont I think no person so happily unites the man of business and the nobleman nicely exact in all his dealings yet generous as the most dissipated and extravagant liberality and oeconomy go hand in hand with him and mutually support each other  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  Your servant Mr Freeman your accounts and mine agree exactly I have look'd them over the vouchers are all right but I fear I have trespass'd upon you by desiring to see you at an hour which men of business generally do and always ought to give up to amusement but my being oblig'd to go into the country so immediately will I hope plead my excuse  E Free  I consider my attendance on your lordship at any hour as one of the rational pleasures of a man  of business as your conversation at once entertains and enlarges my mind  L Bel  You are extremely polite Mr Freeman and I shall be glad of every opportunity to cultivate the friendship of a person whose dealings as a man and manners as a gentleman I so much esteem If you can spare a little time from business I shall be very glad of the pleasure of your company in Worcestershire  E Free  I am extremely oblig'd to your lordship but my father now growing infirm his health requires a recess from trouble and fatigue and he passes most of the summer in the country I therefore am confin'd  L Bel  You have a brother tho' whose attendance I shou'd imagine might set you freehe is bred to business I think  E Free  Yes my lord but he is too fine a gentleman to follow it The air of Lombardstreet is too heavy for his constitution he usually resides at this end of the town has quitted business and commenc'd fortunehunter  L Bel    aside    As I suspected I fear then Mr Freeman he will make but a bad exchange both a man's means and manners shou'd be suited to his situation before he can possibly make a figure in it  E Free  Nothing can be truer than your lordship's remark but reason has no power over dissipated minds and experience alone can reclaim them however I will try once more to bring him back by argument  L Bel  I heartily wish you success Mr Freeman  E Free  And I your lordship a good night  L Bel  Your most obedient sir    Exit Elder Freeman  His brother certainly must be the manHow he cou'd possibly become acquainted with Louisa I can't conceive but public places put every person on a level and at some of these he must have seen her Tomorrow I will find this Freeman and bring him to a severe account both for Emily and Louisa    Exit  END of the FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  Discovers Lady  Louisa  at her toilet her Maid waiting  L Loui  GIVE me that book and then you may withdraw I shall not want you again tonight    Exit Maid    What can keep Freeman does he sleep when his good stars and mine are all awake It seems as if the god of love himself had interfer'd and dispos'd of the whole family in such a way as to prevent all interruptionIn short there never was nor will be such a charming opportunity  Enter Younger  Freeman  O Mr Freeman what cou'd tempt you to such a dangerous act of indiscretion I shall be totally ruin'd if you shou'd be discovered  Y Free  Fear nothing my angel I will protect you from all danger this happy night I shall become your guardian and all my future life shall be devoted to your service  L Loui  This night did you say Mr Freeman How is it possible  Y Free  If you consent to bless me with your hand we may escape this moment I did not hear a creature in the house they are all retired to rest then do not lose this lucky crisis but fly to love and happiness this moment  L Loui  It will be deem'd so rash a step I fear my brother never will forgive meHad we not better ask his consent  Y Free    aside    I must parry that strokeWhat are brothers fathers mothers sisters uncles or aunts to love They might perhaps postpone our happiness for settlements and such dull stuff for I can assure your ladyship there wou'd be no fear of a refusalthe family of Freeman  L Loui  I have no doubt but my friends wou'd be extremely pleased with your alliance sir and for that reason wish we had consulted them  Y Free  Why so do I since you seem now to desire it but oh my charmer think what I must suffer by the least delay then let me gently press you to be mine my chariot's at the gardendoor  L Loui  I know not how to consent or to deny  Y Free  Dear lovely angel do not torture me nor tear my faithful heart with doubts and fears you must you shall be mine  L Loui  What will the world say of me  Y Free  Say that you had love generosity and spirit to trust a man of honour but why will you thus waste the precious minutes  L Loui  I find you can persuade me to any thing  Y Free  Generous creature now let us fly  L Loui  Ha there's my sister going to her chamber which overlooks the garden we must not stir 'till she is in bed Step into the next room as it is possible she may come here    Exit Y Freeman Louisa sits at her toilet reading  Enter Lady  Mary  L Mar  What are you reading Louisa  L Loui  Pope's Homer sister  L Mar  Then you have no mind to compose yourself to rest I perceive the loftiness of the subject and elegance of the language will be apt to rouse your attention and keep you awake  L Loui  I am vastly sleepy notwithstanding that  L Mar  Then I will not trespass on your repose tho' I am unaccountably wakefulShall I go with you to your chamber  L Loui  No sister I'll go with you to yours  L Mar  Come then and if you have any good nature you'll chat to me while I undress    Exeunt  SCENE II  Lord  Belmont  's library  Enter Lord  Belmont  L Bel  Poor Charlesat last he is gonewhat difficulty have I had in persuading him to seek for the  only relief his present situation can admit ofrestIn some few hours I hope his passions will be as much rais'd with joy as they are now depress'd by anxiety for as I can have no doubt of Emily's conduct or his honour they must yet be happy    A noise of laughing    By that sound I perceive that jolly threescore are still at their bottle perhaps they are in the right age shou'd enjoy or rather catch each passing moment of delight youth shou'd husband time and spend it sparingly the spirit not the lees of life is worth preserving  Enter Sir  Charles Somerville  I hope you have met no accident to bring you back Sir Charles  Sir Char  I scarce have breath to tell youPassing again by your gardendoor I saw it stand open and at a little distance a chariot I asked the coachman who he waited for he said Mr Freeman he is this moment in your house my lord upon some clandestine purpose  L Bel  You have amazed me but let us act with caution nor trust my servants with my sisters honourto one of them he comes O Charles this is a heavy trial  Sir Char  It may not be so bad as you imagine your own maxim is to hope the best  L Bel  We are all philosophers when others suffer but tremblingly alive to our own feelings I'll go this moment and search every apartment Do you place yourself upon the center of the staircase and lock the folding doorsif the villain shou'd fly from me you must meet him But remember Sir Charles he is accountable to me this night tomorrow he may answer you    Exeunt severally  SCENE III  Lady  Louisa  's dressingroom  Enter Lady  Louisa  L Loui  Was there ever any creature so teizing as Lady Mary I really believe if I had staid with  her she wou'd have continued talking 'till morning It is amazing that she don't go to bed I dare not let Mr Freeman out 'till I think she is asleep Bless me what noise is this  Enter Lady  Mary  L Mar  O Louisa my brother is this moment running from room to room and searching every corner with his sword drawn and a wildness in his countenance not to be express'd I am terrified to death  L Loui  I am undone Freeman is in my chamber  L Mar  What shall we do There may be murder if they meet  L Loui  I cannot speak or think  L Mar  Let him fly down the back stairs  L Loui  It must be so there is no other wayDo you return to your chamber    Exeunt severally  SCENE IV  A passage with a chamberdoor shut  Enter Young  Freeman  Y Free  The staircase door is lock'd there's no retreating If I cou'd get into any of the rooms on the middle floor I wou'd leap out of the window and hazard my neck rather than bear to be expos'd I hear Lord Belmont's voice I'll force this door at all events    Pushes it open and discovers Emily  Ha what has conjur'd up the only form that at this moment cou'd encrease my terror  Emi  Is it an apparition that I see Defend me gracious heaven  Y Free  Dear madam don't be alarmed upon my knees I beg you will protect me my life's at stake and what is dearer still a lady's honour  Emi  Inhuman wretch you have already robb'd me of all that was most precious my lover and my fame I have now nothing but my life to lose and you may take it freely  Y Free  By heaven madam I never design'd you the least injury and if you have the smallest grain  of compassion you will assist me to escape I am absolutely ruin'd if you don't and so is Lady LouisaIs there no way to get out  Emi  Thou worse than murderer do not profane a lady's name that I am certain knows you not but if you have the least compunction for all the sorrows you have brought on me say why you haunt me thus  Enter Lord  Belmont  Lady  Mary  and Lady  Louisa  L Bel  Now ladies this affair must be explain'dWho are you sir that have thus broke into my house at midnight and taken refuge in this lady's chamber  Y Free  I'm at my last push there is but one way    Aside  L Bel  This moment speak who are you  Y Free  A gentleman my lord but one I must confess who tempted by strong passion has infring'd that just respect which is your lordship's due by entering your house without your knowledge but love my lord  L Bel  Of whom declare that instantly  L Loui    aside    Now I'm undone  Y Free  Your lordship will I hope excuse my mentioning the lady as she is equally involv'd in this unlucky accident  L Bel  No trifling sir explain yourself this moment    Sir  Charles  appears  Sir Char    aside    Sure 'tis a vision no it is my Emily  Y Free  Will nothing sir avail to save the lady's honour  L Bel  Nothing shall save your life sir but a fair confession  Y Free  Why then my lord I must own tho' very unwillingly upon my honour that I came hither by this lady's appointment    Points to Emily  Sir Char  my fears are true and I can hold no longer    comes forward    Ungrateful woman  Emi  Good heaven this is too much    Faints L  Louisa  and Lady  Mary  carry her off  L Loui  This is lucky however    Aside  L Bel  I am struck dumb with wonder  Y Free    aside    What the devil has brought him hereYour lordship sees how much you have distress'd the lady by pressing her to own her passion ladies are apt to be bashful when there are strangers byPerhaps Sir Charles may not know me    Aside  Sir Char  I beg my lord you will inform me  L Bel  Pray Somerville be calm at a proper time I shall satisfy all your enquiries about Emily    To Freeman    I have one question more to ask you sir  Y Free  I am ready to answer with the same truth my lordEgad I shall come off with flying colours    Aside  L Bel  Were not you in this house about seven this evening  Y Free  Why as a man of honour my lord I can't possibly tell a lye I was here about that time but the lady was then afraid of being discovered and desired me to come at this hour when we concluded the family wou'd be at rest  L Bel  I am satisfied  Y Free  Why then my lord I beg leave to wish you and the ladies a very good night and ask a thousand pardons for disturbing your lordship's repose    Going    Lady Louisa appears  L Loui    aside    He has brought me off triumphantly but I must see the event  Sir Char  Stay sir I have yet something to say to you  Y Free  Well sir pray what are your commands  Sir Char  In that light you are to understand them sir for they shall be obey'd  Y Free  You'll please to be as brief as you can sir for it grows late  Sir Char  That I have lov'd that wretched hapless Emily I need not now inform you I have no doubt  but she has already gratified your vanity by boasting of the sacrifice she made however worthless she herself might think it  Y Free  Upon my honour sir the lady never mention'd your name to me in her life  Sir Char  No interruption nor evasion sir they can't avail Fallen as she is at present in my esteem I will still as far as she has left it possible preserve her same you must marry her immediately sir  L Loui  Ha what can this mean  Y Free  You are not in earnest sir  Sir Char  Quite determined  Y Free  You must excuse me sirYou do me honourBut I have particular reasonswhich at present I cannot so well explain  Sir Char    draws    Villain defend yourself  L Bel    interposes    Not in this house Sir Charles I must not suffer it  Sir Char  No place shou'd be a sanctuary for such a monster  Enter Mr  Belmont  and Mr  Southerne  Bel  Why what the devil's the matter here if you are for a bout of tilting have with you I'll be on the weaker side  South  I say what's the matter I am a magistrate and command the peace in the king's name  Sir Char    To Free    We are prevented now but if you do not chuse to join the name of coward to that of villain I shall expect to hear from you tomorrow  Y Free  Pray sir hear me now  South  Why hey what the devil is this Here are the two fellows that ran away with my daughter they shall give an account of her directly who knows but they have murder'd her I command you all to assist me to apprehend them  Enter  Emily  and falls at Mr  Southerne  's feet  Emi  Behold that wretched daughter at your feet murder'd indeed in her lost peace and fame but still alive to filial tenderness O Somerville  Bel  Why Miss Lawson what do you kneel to him for get up my pretty creature and come to your own love don't cry don't cryJust as she stands now she wou'd make a pretty model for a small Niobe  South  No don't cry child and I'll make one of them at least marry you or I'll hang them both  Bel  Neither of them shall have her I'll marry her myself  South  What marry your niece brother Belmont Why don't you know Emily is my daughter  Bel  None of your shams to me I won't believe a word of it  L Bel    To Freeman    Have you had leisure sir to make your option whether you will accept this lady for your wife or vindicate your refusal with your sword  Emi  What can you mean my lord why am I offer'd to that detested wretch No power on earth shall force me to be his  Sir Char  Well acted madam but the farce is done  Y Free  You hear my lord that the lady absolutely refuses you would not be so cruel to compel her  South  Ay but I say I will compel her and you too I'll have no more plague with her this was the way she serv'd me about Winterbottom I wish I had made her marry him  Bel  Egad I begin to think she is his daughter and if that be the case she shall get a husbandDo you hear you hatchetface gentleman that are very like my worst medal of Nero if you don't marry my niece directly you shall have a couple of ounces of  lead in your stomach for breakfast instead of your coffee tomorrowmorning that is if she says you promis'd her marriage but if not you are at liberty to go about your business  Y Free  I dare appeal sir to the lady's truth and honour if she says I ever promis'd to marry her I am ready to do so this moment  Bel  Why that's fair enough  South  I say right or wrong nolens volens he shall marry her  Y Free  Pray madam speak  Emi  Though your inhuman artifices have undone me I claim no promise from you and call on heaven to witness that 'till within this hour I never spoke to you nor saw your face but once 'till this unhappy night in my whole life  L Bel  This is amazing  Sir Char  By heaven she does not blush Sure madam you forget that I stand here Is it not enough that you are sunk in my esteem But will you teach me to despise myself for having ever lov'd a woman that can be capable of such mean such unavailing falshood  Emi  Sir Charles I pity more than blame you  Sir Char  Insolent generosity But I disclaim your pity keep it madam for yourself lest you should miss it elsewhere  Bel  Pray sir don't scold my niece so I don't see how she has deserv'd it from you  Emi  O Somerville is it possible you yet can doubt my innocence  Sir Char  No madam I have no doubts but beg you'll not profane a term that is your sex's brightest ornamentyour innocence  South  Come gentlemen all this talk signifies nothing one or other of ye must marry my daughter that's certain You have acquitted this gentleman child now what have you to say to the other I can  safely swear he promised to marry you for he asked my consent  Bel  If that be the case I shall discourse him presently  South  Come don't be afraid to speak child I am in a very good humour now and if you have a mind for that same knight before George he shall marry you or I'll hamper him at law that I will  Emi  You are so kind to promise sir you will confirm my option  South  Ay that I will here's my hand for it  Bel  And here's mine too niece tho' I am sorry to call you so that no man alive shall use you ill while I am able to draw a trigger if it was only for sake of that love I had for you when I had a mind to be nearer related to you  L Bel    To Sir Charles    I cannot guess where this will end  Sir Char  I am all impatience  Emi  Tho' it must call a blush into a virgin's cheek to own her love before so many witnesses yet as it is the only declaration of this kind that I shall ever make I will confess that dearer than my life or fame I love Sir Charles Somerville  Sir Char  Confusion Belmont what can she intend  Emi  Pray hear me out the difficulty's past I have avowed my love but were that man whom my heart owns its lord to sue with all his former tenderness and passion to obtain my hand not worlds shou'd bribe me to bestow it  Bel    aside    That's very odd tho'  Emi  While in his heart there cou'd remain a single doubt of my truth or honour and as my injur'd fame is now obscured all I request is that you will permit me to retire to some distant part of the world where my unhappy story is not known and where my name may never bring disgrace upon my family  this sir is my sole request and you have promised me to grant it  Sir Char  O Belmont she has torn my heart but yet conviction cannot lye my eyes my ears are witness of her falshood  Bel  By Jupiter Ammon you sha'n't go into any lonesome place you shall live with me  Sir Char    To Emily    Madam the kind confession you have made at least deserves my thanks and I am truly sorry your conduct shou'd have contradicted it so far as to make them the sole return I can with honour offer  Y Free    aside    I begin to feel unhappy about this girl I cou'd almost recantbut what becomes of Louisa then  Emi  Had my resentment and resolves left it in your power to have shewn gratitude in any other way you never shou'd have known your obligation  L Bel  Still more and more mysterious    To Sir Charles    I know not what to think but let her faults be what they may she carries her punishment in her own breast and bears it nobly  Sir Char    To L Belmont    I am distress'd beyond all measure I cannot stand this scene    To Emily    Madam my ardent wishes for your happiness tho' with as little hopes of their success as those I may bestow upon my own shall still be yoursat present I am sure I rather increase than lessen your distress I therefore take my leave  Emi  Adieu for ever    Sir Charles bows as going off  Enter Lady  Louisa  and Lady  Mary  L Loui  Stay sir though I were sure to forfeit as much happiness as Emily deserves to possess I cou'd not think of saving it at her expence  Sir Char    To Lady  Louisa  Speak madam quickly speak  L Loui  You must allow me time I have a severe task to go through and first must own myself unworthy  of the most unbounded confidence that a kind brother ever yet bestowed or a rash girl abus'd  Y Free    aside    Sure the devil won't tempt her to betray herself  L Bel  Speak without fear Louisa and be assur'd your motives for this generous confession already have excus'd you  L Loui  Shou'd even the loss of your esteem my lord attend the knowledge of my fault I cannot bear that innocence shou'd suffer and therefore will avow it That gentleman    points to  Freeman  came here this night to me  Sir Char  Impossible  Y Free    aside    I shall have my throat cut that I see plainly  L Bel  By your appointment sister who did he come to in the afternoon  Sir Char  Aye my lord what brought him hither at that time This is what ladies call a pious fraud of friendship  L Mary  Equally inclin'd to clear that lady's character tho' not equally involved in the consequences I own that I was acquainted with his visit at that time Your lordship may remember my confusion when you came up this evening  Bel  Is the man bewitch'd Did he court all my nieces and won't marry any of them I'll fight him with three case of pistols  South  I am in a stound Brother Belmont I don't understand all this  L Bel  I do remember that you seem'd distress'd but pray was it to you he came    To Lady  Mary  L Loui  No my lord it was tome Speak Mr Freeman you have often told me your family and fortune might claim me for your wife are you ashamed of your attachment to me  Y Free  O by no means madam tho' I may appear a little aukward at present  L Loui  You see my brother is ready to forgive my folly in carrying on a match clandestinely that I might have own'd with honour but indeed my lord it was my own romance tho' I think Mr Freeman has acquiesced rather too far  Y Free  Why to be sure ma'am it was entirely to gratify your ladyship's humour that I did not at first apply to my lord  L Loui  I have confess'd it sir  Y Free  But since matters have taken this odd ridiculous turn I think it will be the best way to let my lawyer wait upon his lordship in the morning with my rentroll your ladyship shall have a carte blanche I assure you quite the same as if this affair had never happen'd    Aside    Egad I wish I was fairly out of the house  L Bel    aside    Insolent puppy  Y Free  As matters seem now to be upon a proper footing I think it will not be amiss if I retire  Sir Char  Hold sir did not I find you in this lady's closet    points to  Emily  one night at Bath You did not come to Lady Louisa there  L Loui  Ha this I am quite a stranger to  Y Free    aside    Egad it is all out now Why sir that this lady and I have met before is most certain    Points to  Emily  Emi  Good heaven can you persist in such inhuman falshood  Sir Char  O 'tis quite clear and this affair of Lady Louisa's is all pretence my lord  L Loui  'Tis not unlikely I may be deceiv'd    To  Emily  You shou'd have own'd your acquaintance with Mr Freeman sooner madam and not suffer'd me to expose myself by trying to save your character which is already lost  L Mary  Do not insult her sister if she is innocent it is a crime if guilty she has load enough to bear  Enter a  Servant  Serv  My lord the gentleman who was with you upon business to night desires to be admitted to you upon a very particular occasion  L Bel  Bid him walk in    Exit  Servant  Emi  Must my disgrace be made the common topic and I the public gaze Let me retire my lord  L Bel  No Emily I intreat your stay for a few minutes perhaps this gentleman may be of use  Emi  I have no right my lord to hope relief from strangers when love and friendship have abandon'd me Yet I will stay if you desire it for grief like mine is patient  Enter Elder  Freeman  Y Free    aside    Nay then the devil does owe me a spite and is resolv'd to pay it  E Free  By the confusion I read in my brother's face my lord I begin to think that my presence is unnecessary to his detection But I beg the honour of speaking a word or two to your lordship apart    They retire to the side of the scene  L Loui  His brother 'Tis I that shall become the public topic now  South  Hey day Brother Belmont what new adventure is going to open on us now  Bel    To Lady  Mary  I suppose this gentleman must be your humble servant Lady Mary  L Bel  I am infinitely indebted to your friendship sir Sir Charles this gentleman has confirmed what Louisa has before confessed What is your opinion now  Sir Char  I know not what to think I am distracted but still that Bath affair dwells on my mind and weighs down all my hopes  Y Free  Why then sir since Mr John Freeman has thought proper to expose me before Lady Louisa and that I have no farther hopes of recovering her  favour I will without reserve ease your mind and my own by discovering the whole truth  L Bel  Do that sir and you may find a friend where you had reason to expect an enemy  South  Ay do pray tell us how that same business came about  Emi  Pray sir do not keep me longer on the rack  Y Free  I must have time to blush a little before Lady Louisa madam as I may possibly appear in her eyes a most unworthy wretch  L Loui  Nothing that you can say sir will alter my opinion of you or remove the contempt I feel for myself so pray proceed  Y Free  Well madam    to  Emily  the story is but short You had a very pretty maid at Bath  South  A bold pert slut Mrs Southerne never liked her  Y Free  But I did sir nor was she in the least cruel and by her appointment I was passing thro' your chamber into hers at the very instant that gentleman    points to Sir  Charles  and you came into the room She pushed me into your closet shut the door and vanished The rest you know too well  Sir Char  How cou'd you sir be so inhuman to let my Emily suffer O Belmont I dare not look upon her  Y Free  Sir Charles had your passion suffered you to have asked me then my errand I shou'd have frankly own'd it but while I had hopes of Lady Louisa I could not with any decency have revealed these last particulars And now that I have done all in my power to set matters to rights and atone my faults I can only in palliation of my behaviour say that it was not badness of heart but dislike to a sedentary life which tempted me to leave my sphere and soar at higher objects In which I am now sensible I have justly failed and must encounter the deserved fate of those whom vanity seduces from the situation of life provided for them  E Free  The daring to confess we have been wrong is not only the highest act of bravery but the best security for our future amendment and thus reclaim'd I am proud to embrace my brother  South  But what is all this to my poor child's character that had like to be ruined by you and that impudent baggage  Emi  O sir I am too happy to have my conduct cleared both to the world and you And yet how gladly wou'd I now recall the fond confession which distraction wrung from my weak sinking heart and now o'erwhelms me with blushes and confusion  L Loui  You have no cause to blush it is for weakness such as mine to sink under my own reproach  L Bel  You are both too rigid to yourselves but there is one who well deserves your pity because he fears to ask it  Sir Char  I do not my lord presume to ask for Emily's forgiveness nor dare I form a hope that she shou'd grant it  Emi  Sir Charles I do not wish to triumph over your humility but beg you will allow me to indulge my own generosity by assuring you that thro' this whole affair I never once condemned but pitied your mistake  Sir Char  My generous Emily  Bel  Why what is all this about If you like my niece why don't you come and take her and her pity and her pardon together and I'll give you a good five thousand pounds into the bargain Come brother give her hand to Sir Charles and let's make an end of it  South  With all my heart brother if they are both willing for I promised my lord to give my consent  L Bel  Now Emily it rests on you alone to shew that noble minds most easily forgive  Emi  I have been only on the defensive my lord during this whole warfare and such an enemy is generally  ready for terms of peace therefore if you shou'd hold out the olive branch in my name to your ally you may suppose I shall accede to the treaty  Sir Char  No words can speak my gratitude my heart's too full for utterance Transporting charmer every way you have conquer'd subdued me by esteem as well as love  L Bel  From these events the innocent may know  That suffering is the lightest part of woe  While our own conduct vindicates from blame  Slander defeated but augments our fame  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Sent by a
