 THE  WIVES REVENGED A  COMIC OPERA  IN ONE ACT As it is performed at the  THEATREROYAL  IN COVENTGARDEN  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY No FleetStreet MDCCLXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act which are generally characterized either by their natural simplicity or some single striking incident and little or nothing more is designedIt is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the English theatre as containing excellent situations for light airsOn the French stage notwithstanding all their merit they tire in the length of time taken for representation and were they spun out to the common length of our afterpieces it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient  The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved and the dialogue both varied and compressed they are with every deference submitted to public judgment  C DIBDIN  CHARACTERS  MEN  Mr  Vermilion  Mr MATTOCKS  Alderman
