BUCKLAND J F and C RIVINGTON T LONGMAN W FENNER T FIELD and E and C DILLY MDCCLXXVII  PREFACE To all that are concerned in the EDUCATION of CHILDREN  My Friends  _IT is an awful and important Charge that is committed to you The Wisdom and Welfare of the succeeding Generation are intrusted with you beforehand and depend much on your Conduct The Seeds of Misery or Happiness in this World and that to come are oftentimes  sown very early and therefore whatever may conduce to give the Minds of Children a Relish for Virtue and Religion ought in the first Place to be proposed to you  VERSE was at first designed for the Service of GOD though it hath been wretchedly abused since The Ancients among the Jews and the Heathens taught their Children and Disciples the Precepts of Morality and Worship in Verse The Children of Israel were commanded to learn the Words of the Song of Moses  Deut xxxi  and we are directed in the New Testament not only to sing  with Grace in the Heart  but to  teach and admonish one another by Hymns and Songs  Ephes v And there are these four Advantages in it  I THERE is a great Delight in the very learning of Truths and Duties this Way There is something so amusing and entertaining in Rhymes and Metre that will incline Children to make this Part of their Business a Diversion And you may turn their very Duty into a Reward by giving them the Privilege of learning one of these SONGS every Week if they fulfil the Business of the Week well and promising them the Book itself when they have learnt ten or twenty Songs out of it  II WHAT is learnt in Verse is longer retained in Memory and sooner recollected The like Sounds and the like Number of Syllables exceedingly assist the Remembrance And it may often happen that the End of a Song running in the Mind may be an effectual means to keep off some Temptations  or to incline to some Duty when a Word of Scripture is not upon their Thoughts  III THIS will be a constant Furniture for the Minds of Children that they may have something to think upon when alone and sing over to themselves This may sometimes give their Thoughts a divine Turn and raise a young Meditation Thus they will not be forced to seek Relief for an Emptiness of Mind out of the loose and dangerous Sonnets of the Age  IV THESE  Divine Songs  may be a pleasant and proper Matter for their Daily or Weekly Worship to sing one in the Family at such Time as the Parents or Governors shall appoint and therefore I have confined the Verse to the most usual Psalm Tunes  THE greatest part of this little Book was composed several Years ago at the Request of a Friend who has been long engaged in the Work of Catechising a very great Number of Children of all kinds and with abundant Skill and Success So that you will find here nothing that savours of a Party The Children of high and low Degree of the Church of England or Dissenters baptised in Infancy or not may all join together in these Songs And as I have endeavoured to sink the Language to the Level of a Child's Understanding and yet to keep it if possible above Contempt so I have designed to profit all if possible and offend none I hope the more general the Sense is these Composures may be of the more universal Use and Service  I HAVE added at the End some Attempts of SONNETS on MORAL SUBJECTS for Children with an Air of Pleasantry to provoke some fitter Pen to write a little Book of them  MAY the Almighty GOD make you faithful in this important Work of Education may he succeed your Cares with his abundant Grace that the rising Generation of Great Britain may be a Glory among the Nations a Pattern to the Christian World and a Blessing to the Earth  CONTENTS  Song Page  A General Song of Praise to GOD  Praise for Creation and Providence  Praise to GOD for our

A general Song of Praise to GOD  I  HOW glorious is our heav'nly King  Who reigns above the Sky  How shall a Child presume to sing  His dreadful Majesty  II  How great his Pow'r is none can tell  Nor think how large his Grace  Not Men below nor Saints that dwell  On high before his Face  III  Not Angels that stand round the LORD  Can search his secret Will  But they perform his heav'nly Word  And sing his Praises still  IV  Then let me join this holy Train  And my first Off'rings bring  Th' eternal GOD will not disdain  To hear an Infant sing  V  My Heart resolves my Tongue obeys  And Angels shall rejoice  To hear their mighty Maker's Praise  Sound from a feeble Voice  SONG II  Praise for Creation and Providence  I  I Sing th' Almighty Pow'r of GOD  That made the Mountains rise  That spread the flowing Seas abroad  And built the lofty Skies  II  I sing the Wisdom that ordain'd  The Sun to rule the Day  The Moon shines full at his Command  And all the Stars obey  III  I sing the Goodness of the LORD  That fill'd the Earth with Food  He form'd the Creatures with his Word  And then pronounc'd them Good  IV  LORD how thy Wonders are display'd  Where'er I turn mine Eye  If I survey the Ground I tread  Or gaze upon the Sky  V  There's not a Plant or Flow'r below  But makes thy Glories known  And Clouds arise and Tempests blow  By Order from thy Throne  VI  Creatures as num'rous as they beâ–ª  Are subject to thy Care  There's not a Place where we can flee  But GOD is present there  VII  In Heav'n he shines with Beams of Love  With Wrath in Hell beneath  'Tis on his Earth I stand or move  And 'tis his Air I breathe  VIII  His Hand is my perpetual Guard  He keeps me with his Eye  Why should I then forget the LORD  Who is for ever nigh  SONG III  Praise to GOD for our Redemption  I  BLEST be the Wisdom and the Pow'r  The Justice and the Grace  That join'd in Counsel to restore  And save our ruin'd Race  II  Our Father ate forbidden Fruit  And from his Glory fell  And we his Children thus were brought  To Death and near to Hell  III  Blest be the LORD that sent his Son  To take our Flesh and Blood  He for our Lives gave up his own  To make our Peace with GOD  IV  He honour'd all his Father's Laws  Which we have disobey'd  He bore our Sins upon the Cross  And our full Ransom paid  V  Behold him rising from the Grave  Behold him rais'd on high  He pleads his Merit there to save  Transgressors doom'd to die  VI  There on a glorious Throne he reigns  And by his Pow'r divine  Redeems us from the slavish Chains  Of Satan and of Sin  VII  Thence shall the LORD to Judgment come  And with a sov'reign Voice  Shall call and break up ev'ry Tomb  While waking Saints rejoice  VIII  O may I then with Joy appear  Before the Judge's Face  And with the bless'd Assembly there  Sing his Redeeming Grace  SONG IV  Praise for Mercies Spiritual and Temporal  I  WHene'er I take my Walks abroad  How many Poor I see  What shall I render to my GOD  For all his Gifts to me  II  Not more than others I deserve  Yet GOD his giv'n me more  For I have Food while others starve  Or beg from Door to Door  III  How many Children in the Street  Half naked I behold  While I am cloth'd from Head to Feet  And cover'd from the Cold  IV  While some poor Wretches scarce can tell  Where they may lay their Head  I have a Home wherein to dwell  And rest upon my Bed  V  While others early learn to Swear  And Curse and Lye and Steal  LORD I am taught thy Name to fear  And do thy holy Will  VI  Are these thy Favours Day by Day  To me above the Rest  Then let me love Thee more than they  And try to serve Thee best  SONG V  Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land  I  GREAT GOD to thee my Voice I raise  To thee my youngest Hours belong  I would begin my Life with Praise  Till growing Years improve the Song  II  'Tis to thy sov'reign Grace I owe  That I was born on British Ground  Where Streams of heav'nly Mercy flow  And Words of sweet Salvation sound  III  I would not change my native Land  For rich Peru with all her Gold  A nobler Prize lies in my Hand  Than East or Western Indies hold  IV  How do I pity those that dwell  Where Ignorance and Darkness reigns  They know no Heav'nâ–ª they fear no Hell  Those endless Joys those endless Pains  V  Thy glorious Promises O LORD  Kindle my Hopes and my Desire  While all the Preachers of thy Word  Warn me to 'scape eternal Fire  VI  Thy Praise shall still employ my Breath  Since thou hast mark'd my Way to Heav'n  Nor will I run the Road to Death  And waste the Blessings thou hast giv'n  SONG VI  Praise for the Gospel  I  LORD I ascribe it to thy Grace  And not to Chance as others do  That I was born of CHRISTIAN Race  And not a Heathen or a Jew  II  What would the ancient Jewish Kings  And Jewish Prophets once have giv'n  Could they have heard those glorious Things  Which CHRIST reveal'd and brought from Heav'n  III  How glad the Heathens would have been  That worship'd Idols Wood and Stone  If they the Book of GOD had seen  Or JESUS and his Gospel known  IV  Then if this Gospel I refuse  How shall I e'er lift up mine Eyes  For all the Gentiles and the Jews  Against me will in Judgment rise  SONG VII  The Excellency of the BIBLE  I  GREAT GOD with Wonder and with Praise  On all thy Works I look  But still thy Wisdom Pow'r and Grace  Shine brightest in thy Book  II  The Stars that in their Courses roll  Have much Instruction giv'n  But thy good Word informs my Soul  How I may climb to Heav'n  III  The Fields provide me Food and show  The Goodness of the LORD  But Fruits of Life and Glory grow  In thy most holy Word  IV  Here are my choicest Treasures hid  Here my best Comfort lies  Here my Desires are satisfy'd  And hence my Hopes arise  V  LORD make me understand thy Law  Shew what my Faults have been  And from thy Gospel let me draw  Pardon for all my Sin  VI  Here would I learn how CHRIST has dy'd  To save my Soul from Hell  Not all the Books on Earth beside  Such heav'nly Wonders tell  VII  Then let me love my Bible more  And take a fresh Delight  By Day to read these Wonders o'er  And meditate by Night  SONG VIII  Praise to GOD for learning to Read  I  THE Praises of my Tongue  I offer to the LORD  That I was taught and learnt so young  To read his holy Word  II  That I am brought to know  The Danger I was in  By Nature and by Practice too  A wretched Slave to Sin  III  That I am lead to see  I can do nothing well  And whither shall a Sinner flee  To save himself from Hell  IV  Dear LORD this Book of thine  Informs me where to go  For Grace to pardon all my Sin  And make me holy too  V  Here I can read and learn  How CHRIST the Son of GOD  Has undertook our great Concern  Our Ransom cost his Blood  VI  And now he reigns above  He sends his Spirit down  To shew the Wonders of his Love  And make his Gospel known  VII  O may that Spirit teach  And make my Heart receive  Those Truths which all thy Servants preach  And all thy Saints believe  VIII  Then shall I praise the LORD  In a more chearful Strain  That I was taught to read his Word  And have not learnt in vain  SONG IX  The Allseeing GOD  I  ALMIGHTY GOD thy piercing Eye  Strikes thro' the Shades of Night  And our most secret Actions lie  All open to thy Sight  II  There's not a Sin that we commit  Nor wicked Word we say  But in thy dreadful Book 'tis writ  Against the JudgmentDay  III  And must the Crimes that I have done  Be read and publish'd there  Be all expos'd before the Sun  While Men and Angels hear  IV  LORD at thy Foot asham'd I lie  Upward I dare not look  Pardon my Sins before I die  And blot them from thy Book  V  Remember all the dying Pains  That my Redeemer felt  And let his Blood wash out my Stains  And answer for my Guilt  VI  O may I now for ever fear  T' indulge a sinful Thought  Since the great GOD can see and hear  And writes down ev'ry Fault  SONG X  Solemn Thoughts of GOD and Death  I  THere is a GOD that reigns above  LORD of the Heav'ns and Earth and Seas  I fear his Wrath I ask his Love  And with my Lips I sing his Praise  II  There is a Law which he has writ  To teach us all that we must do  My Soul to his Commands submit  For they are holy just and true  III  There is a Gospel of rich Grace  Whence Sinners all their Comforts draw  LORD I repent and seek thy Face  For I have often broke thy Law  IV  There is an Hour when I must die  Nor do I know how soon 'twill come  A thousand Children young as I  Are call'd by Death to hear their Doom  V  Let me improve the Hours I have  Before the Day of Grace is fled  There's no Repentance in the Grave  Nor Pardons offer'd to the Dead  VI  Just as the Tree cut down that fell  To North or Southward there it lies  So Man departs to Heav'n or Hell  Fix'd in the State wherein he dies  SONG XI  Heaven and Hell  I  THERE is beyond the Sky  A Heav'n of Joy and Love  And holy Children when they die  Go to that World above  II  There is a dreadful Hell  And everlasting Pains  There Sinners must with Devils dwell  In Darkness Fire and Chains  III  Can such a Wretch as I  Escape this cursed End  And may I hope whene'er I die  I shall to Heav'n ascend  IV  Then will I read and pray  While I have Life and Breath  Lest I should be cut off today  And sent t' eternal Death  SONG XII  The Advantages of early Religion  I  HAPPY the Child whose tender Years  Receive Instructions well  Who hates the Sinner's Path and fears  The Road that leads to Hell  II  When we devote our Youth to GOD  'Tis pleasing in his Eyes  A Flow'r when offer'd in the Bud  Is no vain Sacrifice  III  'Tis easier Work if we begin  To fear the LORD betimes  While Sinners that grow old in Sin  Are harden'd in their Crimes  IV  'Twill save us from a thousand Snares  To mind Religion young  Grace will preserve our following Years  And make our Virtue strong  V  To thee Almighty GOD to thee  Our Childhood we resign  'Twill please us to look back and see  That our whole Lives were thine  VI  Let the sweet Work of Pray'r and Praise  Employ my youngest Breath  Thus I'm prepar'd for longer Days  Or fit for early Death  SONG XIII  The Danger of Delay  I  WHY should I say "'Tis yet too soon  "To seek for Heaven or think of Death"  A Flow'r may fade before 'tis Noon  And I this Day may lose my Breath  II  If this rebellious Heart of mine  Despise the gracious Calls of Heav'n  I may be harden'd in my Sin  And never have Repentance giv'n  III  What if the LORD grow wrath and swear  While I refuse to read and pray  That he'll refuse to lend an Ear  To all my Grones another Day  IV  What if his dreadful Anger burn  While I refuse his offer'd Grace  And all his Love to Fury turn  And strike me dead upon the Place  V  'Tis dang'rous to provoke a GOD  His Pow'r and Veng'ance none can tell  One Stroke of his Almighty Rod  Shall send young Sinners quick to Hell  VI  Then 'twill for ever be in vainâ–ª  To cry for Pardon and for Grace  To wish I had my Time again  Or hope to see my Maker's Face  SONG XIV  Examples of early Piety  I  WHAT bless'd Examples do I find  Writ in the Word of Truth  Of Children that began to mind  Religion in their Youth  II  JESUS who reigns above the Sky  And keeps the World in Awe  Was once a Child as young as I  And kept his Father's Law  III  At Twelve Years old he talk'd with Men  The Jews all wond'ring stand  Yet he obey'd his Mother then  And came at her Command  IV  Children a sweet Hosanna sung  And blest their Saviour's Name  They gave him Honour with their Tongue  While Scribes and Priests blaspheme  V  SAMUEL the Child was wean'd and brought  To wait upon the LORD  Young TIMOTHY betimes was taught  To know his holy Word  VI  Then why should I so long delay  What others learnt so soon  I would not pass another Day  Without this Work begun  SONG XV  Against Lying  I  O 'Tis a lovely Thing for Youth  To walk betimes in Wisdom's Way  To fear a Lie to speak the Truth  That we may trust to all they say  II  But Liars we can never trust  Tho' they should speak the Thing that's true  And he that does one Fault at first  And lies to hide it makes it two  III  Have we not known nor heard nor read  How GOD abhors Deceit and Wrong  How Ananias was struck dead  Catch'd with a Lie upon his Tongue  IV  So did his Wife Sapphira die  When she came in and grew so bold  As to confirm that wicked Lie  That just before her Husband told  V  The LORD delights in them that speak  The Words of Truth but ev'ry Liar  Must have his Portion in the Lake  That burns with Brimstone and with Fire  VI  Then let me always watch my Lips  Lest I be struck to Death and Hell  Since GOD a Book of Reck'ning keeps  For ev'ry Lie that Children tell  SONG XVI  Against Quarrelling and Fighting  I  LET Dogs delight to bark and bite  For GOD hath made them so  Let Bears and Lions growl and fight  For 'tis their Nature too  II  But Children you should never let  Such angry Passions rise  Your little Hands were never made  To tear each others Eyes  III  Let Love thro' all your Actions run  And all your Words be mild  Live like the blessed Virgin's Son  That sweet and lovely Child  IV  His Soul was gentle as a Lamb  And as his Stature grew  He grew in Favour both with Man  And GOD his Father too  V  Now LORD of All he reigns Above  And from his heav'nly Throne  He sees what Children dwell in Love  And marks them for his own  SONG XVII  Love between Brothers and Sisters  I  WHatever Brawls disturb the Street  There should be Peace at Home  Where Sisters dwell and Brothers meet  Quarrels should never come  II  Birds in their little Nests agree  And 'tis a shameful Sight  When Children of one Family  Fall out and chide and fight  III  Hard Names at first and threat'ning Words  That are but noisy Breath  May grow to Clubs and naked Swords  To Murder and to Death  IV  The Devil tempts one Mother's Son  To rage against another  So wicked Cain was hurry'd on  Till he had kill'd his Brother  V  The Wife will make their Anger cool  At least before 'tis Night  But in the Bosom of a Fool  It burns till Morninglight  VI  Pardon O LORD our childish Rage  Our little Brawls remove  That as we grow to riper Age  Our Hearts may all be Love  SONG XVIII  Against Scoffing and calling Names  I  OUR Tongues were made to bless the LORD  And not speak ill of Men  When others give a railing Word  We must not rail again  II  Cross Words and angry Names require  To be chastis'd at School  And He's in Danger of Hellfire  That calls his Brother Fool  III  But Lips that dare be so profane  To mock and jeer and scoff  At holy Things or holy Men  The LORD shall cut them off  IV  When Children in heir wanton Play  Serv'd old ELISHA so  And bid the Prophet go his Way  "Go up thou BaldHead go"  V  GOD quickly stopp'd their wicked Breath  And sent two raging Bears  That tore them Limb from Limb to Death  With Blood and Groans and Tears  VI  Great GOD how terrible are Thou  To Sinners e'er so young  Grant me thy Grace and teach me how  To tame and rule my Tongue  SONG XIX  Against Swearing and Cursing and taking God's Name in vain  I  ANGELS that high in Glory dwell  Adore thy Name Almighty GOD  And Devils tremble down in Hell  Beneath the Terrors of thy Rod  II  And yet how wicked Children dare  Abuse thy dreadful glorious Name  And when they're angry how they swear  And curse their Fellows and blaspheme  III  How will they stand before thy Face  Who treated thee with such Disdain  While thou shalt doom them to the Place  Of everlasting Fire and Pain  IV  Then never shall one cooling Drop  To quench their burning Tongues be giv'n  But I will praise thee here and hope  Thus to employ my Tongue in Heav'n  V  My Heart shall be in pain to hear  Wretches affront the LORD above  'Tis that great GOD whose Pow'r I fear  That heav'nly Father whom I love  VI  If my Companions grow profane  I'll leave their Friendship when I hear  Young Sinners take thy Name in vain  And learn to curse and learn to swear  SONG XX  Against Idleness and Mischief  I  HOW doth the little busy Bee  Improve each shining Hour  And gather Honey all the Day  From ev'ry op'ning Flow'r  II  How skilfully she builds her Cell  How neat she spreads the Wax  And labours hard to store it well  With the sweet Food she makes  III  In Works of Labour or of Skill  I would be busy too  For Satan finds some Mischief still  For idle Hands to do  IV  In Books or Work or healthful Play  Let my first Years be past  That I may give for ev'ry Day  Some good Account at last  SONG XXI  Against Evil Company  I  WHY should I join with those in Play  In whom I've no Delight  Who curse and swear but never pray  Who call ill Names and fight  II  I hate to hear a wanton Song  Their Words offend mine Ears  I should not dare defile my Tongue  With Language such as theirs  III  Away from Fools I'll turn mine Eyes  Nor with the Scoffers go  I would be walking with the Wise  That wiser I may grow  IV  From one rude Boy that's us'd to mock  They learn the wicked Jest  One sickly Sheep infects the Flock  And poisons all the rest  V  My God I hate to walk or dwell  With sinful Children here  Then let me not be sent to Hell  Where none but Sinners are  SONG XXII  Against Pride in Clothes  I  WHY should our Garments made to hide  Our Parents Shame provoke our Pride  The Art of Dress did ne'er begin  Till EVE our Mother learnt to sin  II  When first she put the Cov'ring on  Her Robe of Innocence was gone  And yet her Children vainly boast  In the sad Marks of Glory lost  III  How proud we are how fond to shew  Our Clothes and call them rich and new  When the poor Sheep and Silkworm wore  That very Clothing long before  IV  The Tulip and the Butterfly  Appear in gayer Coats than I  Let me be drest fine as I will  Flies Worms and Flow'rs exceed me still  V  Then will I set my Heart to find  Inward Adornings of the Mind  Knowledge and Virtue Truth and Grace  These are the Robes of richest Dress  VI  No more shall Worms with me compare  This is the Raiment Angels wear  The Son of GOD when here below  Put on this blest Apparel too  VII  It never fades it ne'er grows old  Nor fears the Rain nor Moth nor Mold  It takes no Spot but still refines  The more 'tis worn the more it shines  VIII  In this on Earth should I appear  Then go to Heav'n and wear it there  GOD will approve it in his Sight  'Tis his own Work and his Delight  SONG XXIII  Obedience to Parents  I  LET Children that would fear the LORD  Hear what their Teachers say  With Rev'rence meet their Parents Word  And with Delight obey  II  Have you not heard what dreadful Plagues  Are threaten'd by the LORD  To him that breaks his Father's Law  Or mocks his Mother's Word  III  What heavy Guilt upon him lies  How cursed is his Name  The Ravens shall pick out his Eyes  And Eagles eat the same  IV  But those who worship GOD and give  Their Parents Honour due  Here on this Earth they long shall live  And live hereafter too  SONG XXIV  The Child's Complaint  I  WHY should I love my Sports so well  So constant at my Play  And lose the Thoughts of Heav'n and Hell  And then forget to pray  II  What do I read my Bible for  But LORD to learn thy Will  And shall I daily know thee more  And less obey thee still  III  How senseless is my Heart and wild  How vain are all my Thoughts  Pity the Weakness of a Child  And pardon all my Faults  IV  Make me thy heav'nly Voice to hear  And let me love to pray  Since GOD will lend a gracious Ear  To what a Child can say  SONG XXV  A MORNING SONG  I  MY GOD who makes the Sun to know  His proper Hour to rise  And to give Light to all below  Doth send him round the Skies  II  When from the Chambers of the East  His Morning Race begins  He never tires nor stops to rest  But round the World he shines  III  So like the Sun would I fulfil  The Business of the Day  Begin my Work betimes and still  March on my heav'nly Way  IV  Give me O LORD thy early Grace  Nor let my Soul Complain  That the young Morning of my Days  Has all been spent in vain  SONG XXVI  An EVENING SONG  I  AND now another Day is gone  I'll sing my Maker's Praise  My Comforts ev'ry Hour make known  His Providence and Grace  II  But how my Childhood runs to waste  My Sins how great their Sum  LORD give me Pardon for the past  And Strength for Days to come  III  I lay my Body down to Sleep  Let Angels guard my Head  And thro' the Hours of Darkness keep  Their Watch around my Bed  IV  With cheerful Heart I close my Eyes  Since thou wilt not remove  And in the Morning let me rise  Rejoicing in thy Love  SONG XXVII  For the LORD'sDAY MORNING  I  THis is the Day when CHRIST arose  So early from the Dead  Why should I keep my Eyelids clos'd  And waste my Hours in Bed  II  This is the Day when JESUS broke  The Pow'r of Death and Hell  And shall I still wear Satan's Yoke  And love my Sins so well  III  ToDay with Pleasure Christians meet  To pray and hear the Word  And I would go with cheerful Feet  To learn thy Will O LORD  IV  I'll leave my Sport to read and pray  And so prepare for Heav'n  O may I love this blessed Day  The best of all the Sev'n  SONG XXVIII  For the LORD'SDAY EVENING  I  LORD how delightful 'tis to see  A whole Assembly worship Thee  At once they sing at once they pray  They hear of Heav'n and learn the Way  II  I have been there and still would go  'Tis like a little Heav'n below  Not all my Pleasure and my Play  Shall tempt me to forget this Day  III  O write upon my Mem'ry LORD  The Text and Doctrines of thy Word  That I may break thy Laws no more  But love thee better than before  IV  With Thoughts of Christ and Things divine  Fill up this foolish Heart of mine  That hoping Pardon thro' his Blood  I may lie down and wake with GOD  The TEN COMMANDMENTS out of the Old Testament put into short Rhyme for Children  EXODUS CHAP XX  THOU shalt have no more Gods but me  Before no Idol bow thy Knee  Take not the Name of GOD in vain  Nor dare the Sabbathday profane  Give both thy Parents Honour due  Take heed that thou no Murder do  Abstain from Words and Deeds unclean  Nor steal tho' thou art poor and mean  Nor make a wilful Lie nor love it  What is thy Neighbour's dare not covet  The Sum of the COMMANDMENTS out of the New Testament  MATT xxii  WITH all thy Soul love GOD above  And as thyself thy Neighbour love  Our Saviour's Golden Rule  MATT vii  BE you to others kind and true  As you'd have others be to you  And neither do nor say to Men  Whate'er you would not take again  Duty to God and our Neighbour  LOVE GOD with all your Soul and Strength  With all your Heart and Mind  And love your Neighbour as yourself  Be faithful just and kind  Deal with another as you'd have  Another deal with you  What you're unwilling to receive  Be sure you never do  Out of my Book of HYMNS I have here added the HOSANNA and GLORY  to the Father  c to be sung at the End of any of these Songs according to the Direction of Parents or Governors  The Hosanna or Salvation ascribed to CHRIST  Long Metre  I  Hosanna to King David's Son  Who reigns on a superior Throne  We bless the Prince of heav'nly Birth  Who brings Salvation down on Earth  II  Let ev'ry Nation ev'ry Age  In this delightful Work engage  Old Men and Babes in Sion sing  The growing Glories of her King  Common Metre  I  HOsanna to the Prince of Grace  Sion behold thy King  Proclaim the Son of David's Race  And teach the Babes to sing  II  Hosanna to th' Eternal Word  Who from the Father came  Ascribe Salvation to the LORD  With Blessings on his Name  Short Metre  I  HOsanna to the SON  Of David and of GOD  Who brought the News of Pardon down  And bought it with his Blood  II  To CHRIST th' anointed King  Be endless Blessings giv'n  Let the whole Earth his Glory sing  Who made our Peace with Heav'n  GLORY to the FATHER and the SON c  Long Metre  TO GOD the FATHER GOD the SON  And GOD the SPIRIT Three in One  Be Honour Praise and Glory giv'n  By all on Earth and all in Heav'n  Common Metre  NOW let the FATHER and the SON  And SPIRIT be ador'd  Where there are Works to make Him known  Or Saints to love the LORD  Short Metre  GIVE to the FATHER Praise  Give Glory to the SON  And to the SPIRIT of his Grace  Be equal Honour done  SPECIMEN OF MORAL SONGS Such as I wish some happy and condescending Genius would undertake for the Use of Children and perform much better  THE Sense and Subjects might be borrowed plentifully from the  Proverbs of Solomon  from all the common Appearances of Nature from all the Occurrences in Civil Life both in City and Country Which would also afford Matter for other divine Songs Here the Language and Measures should be easy and flowing with Cheerfulness with or without the Solemnities of Religion or the sacred Names of GOD and Holy Things that Children might find Delight and Profit together  This would be one effectual Way to deliver them from the Temptation of loving or learning those idle wanton or profane Songs which give so early an ill Taint to the Fancy and Memory and become the Seeds of future Vices  I The SLUGGARD  I  'TIS the Voice of the Sluggard I heard him complain  "You have wak'd me too soon I must slumber again"  As the Door on its Hinges so he on his Bed  Turns his Sides and his Shoulders and his heavy Head  II  "A little more Sleep and a little more Slumber"  Thus he wastes half his Days and his Hours without Number  And when he gets up he sits folding his Hands  Or walks about saunt'ring or trifling he stands  III  I pass'd by his Garden and saw the wild Brier  The Thorn and the Thistle grow broader and higher  The Cloaths that hang on him are turning to Rags  And his Money still wastes till he starves or he begs  IV  I made him a Visit still hoping to find  He had took better Care for improving his Mind  He told me his Dreams talk'd of Eating and Drinking  But he scarce reads his Bible and never loves Thinking  V  Said I then to my Heart "Here's a Lesson for me"  That Man's but a Picture of what I might be  But Thanks to my Friends for their Care in my Breeding  Who taught me betimes to love Working and Reading  II Innocent Play  I  A Broad in the Meadows to see the young Lambs  Run sporting about by the Side of their Dams  With Fleeces so clean and so white  Or a Nest of young Doves in a large open Cage  When they play all in Love without Anger or Rage  How much may we learn from the Sight  II  If we had been Ducks we might dabble in Mud  Or Dogs we might play till it ended in Blood  So foul and so fierce are their Natures  But Thomas and William and such pretty Names  Should be cleanly and harmless as Doves or as Lambs  Those lovely sweet innocent Creatures  III  Not a Thing that we do nor a Word that we say  Should hinder another in Jesting or Play  For he's still in earnest that's hurt  How rude are the Boys that throw Pebbles and Mire  There's none but a Madman will fling about Fire  And tell you "'Tis all but in Sport"  III The ROSE  I  HOW fair is the Rose what a beautiful Flow'r  The Glory of April and May  But the Leaves are beginning to fade in an Hour  And they wither and die in a Day  II  Yet the Rose has one powerful Virtue to boast  Above all the Flowers of the Field  When its Leaves are all dead and fine Colours are lost  Still how sweet a Perfume it will yield  III  So frail is the Youth and the Beauty of Men  Tho' they bloom and look gay like the Rose  But all our fond Care to preserve them is vain  Time kills them as fast as he goes  IV  Then I'll not be proud of my Youth or my Beauty  Since both of them wither and fade  But gain a good Name by welldoing my Duty  This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead  IV The THIEF  I  WHY should I deprive my Neighbour  Of his Goods against his Will  Hands were made for honest Labour  Not to plunder or to steal  II  'Tis a foolish Selfdeceiving  By such Tricks to hope for Gain  All that's ever got by Thieving  Turns to Sorrow Shame and Pain  III  Have not Eve and Adam taught us  Their sad Profit to compute  To what dismal State they brought us  When they stole forbidden Fruit  IV  Oft we see a young Beginner  Practise little pilf'ring Ways  Till grown up a harden'd Sinner  Then the Gallows ends his Days  V  Theft will not be always hidden  Tho' we fancy none can spy  When we take a Thing forbidden  GOD beholds it with his Eye  VI  Guard my Heart O GOD of Heav'n  Lest I covet what's not mine  Lest I steal what is not giv'n  Guard my Heart and Hands from Sin  V The ANT or EMMET  I  THESE Emmets how little they are in our Eyes  We tread them to Dust and a Troop of them dies  Without our Regard or Concern  Yet as wise as we are if we went to their School  There's many a Sluggard and many a Fool  Some Lessons of Wisdom might learn  II  They don't wear their Time out in Sleeping or Play  But gather up Corn in a sunshiny Day  And for Winter they lay up their Stores  They manage their Work in such regular Forms  One would think they foresaw all the Frosts and the Storms  And so brought their Food within Doors  III  But I have less Sense than a poor creeping Ant  If I take not due Care for the Things I shall want  Nor provide against Dangers in Time  When Death or old Age shall stare in my Face  What a Wretch shall I be in the End of my Days  If I trifle away all their Prime  IV  Now now while my Strength and my  Youth are in Bloom  Let me think what will serve me when  Sickness shall come  And pray that my Sins be forgiv'n  Let me read in good Books and believe and obey  That when Death turns me out of this  Cottage of Clay  I may dwell in a Palace in Heav'n  VI Good Resolutions  I  THO' I am now in younger Days  Nor can tell what shall befall me  I'll prepare for ev'ry Place  Where my growing Age shall call me  II  Should I e'er be Rich or Great  Others shall partake my Goodness  I'll supply the Poor with Meat  Never shewing Scorn or Rudeness  III  Where I see the Blind or Lame  Deaf or Dumb I'll kindly treat them  I deserve to feel the same  If I mock or hurt or cheat them  IV  If I meet with railing Tongues  Why should I return them Railing  Since I best revenge my Wrongs  By my Patience never failing  V  When I hear them telling Lies  Talking foolish Cursing Swearing  First I'll try to make them wise  Or I'll soon go out of hearing  VI  What tho' I be low and mean  I'll engage the Rich to love me  While I'm modest neat and clean  And submit when they reprove me  VII  If I should be poor and sick  I shall meet I hope with Pity  Since I love to help the Weak  Tho' they're neither fair nor witty  VIII  I'll not willingly offend  Nor be easily offended  What's amiss I'll strive to mend  And endure what can't be mended  IX  May I be so watchful still  O'er my Humours and my Passion  As to speak and do no Ill  Tho' it should be all the Fashion  X  Wicked Fashions lead to Hell  Ne'er may I be found complying  But in Life behave so well  Not to be afraid of dying  A SUMMER EVENING  I  HOW fine has the Day been how bright was the Sun  How lovely and joyful the Course that he run  Tho' he rose in a Mist when his Race he begun  And there follow'd some Droppings of Rain  But now the fair Traveller's come to the West  His Rays are all Gold and his Beauties are best  He paints the Sky gay as he sinks to his Rest  And foretels a bright Rising again  II  Just such is the Christian His Course he begins  Like the Sun in a Mist while he mourns for his Sins  And melts into Tears Then he breaks out and shines  And travels his heav'nly Way  But when he comes nearer to finish his Race  Like a fine setting Sun he looks richer in Grace  And gives a sure Hope at the End of his Days  Of rising in brighter Array  Some Copies of the following HYMN having got abroad already into several Hands the Author has been persuaded to permit it to appear in Public at the End of these SONGS for CHILDREN  A CRADLE HYMN  I  HUSH my dear lie still and slumber  Holy Angels guard thy Bed  Heav'nly Blessings without Number  Gently falling on thy Head  II  Sleep my Babe thy Food and Raiment  House and Home thy Friends provide  All without thy Care or Payment  All thy Wants are well supply'd  III  How much better thou'rt attended  Than the SON of GOD could be  When from Heav'n he descended  And became a Child like thee  IV  Soft and easy is thy Cradle  Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay  When his Birthplace was a Stable  And his softest Bed was Hay  V  Blessed Babe what glorious Features  Spotless fair divinely bright  Must he dwell with brutal Creatures  How could Angels bear the Sight  VI  Was there nothing but a Manger  Cursed Sinners could afford  To receive the heavenly Stranger  Did they thus affront their LORD  VII  Soft my Child I did not chide thee  Tho' my Song might sound too hard  'Tis thy Mother Nurse  Here you may use the Words  Brother    Sister    Neighbour    Friend  c  that sits beside thee  And her Arms shall be thy Guard  VIII  Yet to read the shameful Story  How the Jews abus'd their King  How they serv'd the LORD of Glory  Makes me angry while I sing  IX  See the kinder Shepherds round him  Telling Wonders from the Sky  Where they sought him there they found him  With his Virgin Mother by  X  See the lovely Babe adressing  Lovely Infant how he smil'd  When he wept the Mother's Blessing  Sooth'd and hush'd the holy Child  XI  Lo he slumbers in his Manger  Where the horned Oxen fed  Peace my Darling here's no Danger  Here's no Ox anear thy Bed  XII  'Twas to save Thee Child from dying  Save my Dear from burning Flame  Bitter Grones and endless Crying  That thy blest Redeemer came  XIII  May'st thou live to know and fear Him  Trust and love him all thy Days  Then go dwell for ever near Him  See his Face and sing his Praise  XIV  I could give thee thousand Kisses  Hoping what I most desire  Not a Mother's fondest Wishes  Can to greater Joys aspire  THE END  BOOKS published by the AUTHOR for the Use of CHILDREN  I  THE first Sett of Catechisms
