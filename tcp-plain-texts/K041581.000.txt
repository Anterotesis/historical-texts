 Hop Garden  POEMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS  BY CHRISTOPHER SMART A M Fellow of PembrokeHall Cambridge  nonumque prematur in annum  HOR  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR by W STRAHAN And sold by J NEWBERY at the Bible and Sun in St Paul's Churchyard MDCCLII  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE the EARL of MIDDLESEX  My LORD  THE Critics will undoubtedly expect when they see your Name prefixed to this Volume that I should address your Lordship as the Judge of Science and the hereditary Patron of learned Men but I shall take the Liberty of disappointing them having as I presume a stronger and more natural Claim to your Protection from a lucky Accident than from any real Excellence I can pretend to either as a Writer or a Scholar  This lucky Accident my Lord is the Honour I had almost said Merit of being born within a few Miles of your Lordship and tho' I have too much Diffidence to ask your Patronage  as a Poet I have Assurance enough to demand it as  a Man of Kent  I shall not imitate in this Dedication if such an homely Epistle may aspire to so polite a Name the Conduct of most modern Authors who are always particularly fulsome at the very Time they with the utmost Solemnity protest against FlatteryWhat I sincerely believe of you I have said already and you will find it in the introductory Ode on Goodnature which I beg Leave in an especial Manner not only to inscribe but to apply to the Earl of Middlesex  I am  my Lord with the utmost Respect  Your Lordship's most obedient and most obliged humble Servant CHRISTOPHER SMART  LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS NAMES  A  SIR John Abdy Bart  Sir Jacob

and temper ev'n  Celestial sweetness exquisite of mien  Of ev'ry virtue ev'ry praise the queen  II  Soft gracefulness and blooming youth  Where grafted on the stem of truth  That friendship reigns no interest can divide  And great humility looks down on pride  III  Oh curse on Slander's vip'rous tongue  That daily dares thy merit wrong  Ideots usurp thy title and thy frame  Without or virtue talent taste or name  IV  Is apathy is heart of steel  Nor ear to hear nor sense to feel  Life idly inoffensive such a grace  That it shou'd steal thy name and take thy place  V  Nothou art activespirit all  Swifter than light'ning at the call  Of injur'd innocence or griev'd desert  And large with liberality's thy heart  VI  Thy appetitesin easy tides  As reason's luminary guides  Soft flowno wind can work them to a storm  Correctly quick dispassionately warm  VII  Yet if a transport thou canst feel  'Tis only for thy neighbours weal  Great generous acts thy ductile passions move  And smilingly thou weep'st with joy and love  VIII  Mild is thy mind to cover shame  Averse to envy slow to blame  Bursting to praise yet still sincere and free  From flatt'ry's fawning tongue and bending knee  IX  Extensive as from west to east  Thy love descends from man to beast  Nought is excluded little or infirm  Thou canst with greatness stoop to save a worm  X  Come goddess come with all thy charms  For Oh I love thee to my arms  All all my actions guide my fancy feed  So shall  existence  then be  life  indeed  Against ILLNATURE  I  OFSPRING of folly and of pride  To all that's odious all that's  allied  Nurs'd up by vice by pravity missed  By pedant affectation taught and bred  Away thou hideous hellborn spright  Go with thy looks of dark design  Sullen sour and saturnine  Fly to some gloomy shade nor blot the goodly light  Thy planet was remote when I was born  'Twas Mercury that rul'd my natal morn  What time the sun exerts his genial ray  And ripens for enjoyment every growing day  When to exist is but to love and sing  And sprightly Aries smiles upon the spring  II  There in yon lonesome heath  Which Flora or Sylvanus never knew  Where never vegetable drank the dew  Or beast or fowl attempts to breathe  Where Nature's pencil has no colours laid  But all is blank and universal shade  Contrast to figure motion life and light  There may'st thou vent thy spight  For ever cursing and for ever curs'd  Of all th' infernal crew the worst  The worst in genius measure and degree  For envy hatred malice are but parts of thee  III  Or woud'st thou change the scene and quit thy den  Behold the heav'ndeserted fen  Where spleen by vapours dense begot and bred  Hardness of heart and heaviness of head  Have rais'd their darksome walls and plac'd their thorny bed  There may'st thou all thy bitterness unload  There may'st thou croak in concert with the toad  With thee the hollow howling winds shall join  Nor shall the bittern her base throat deny  The querulous frogs shall mix their dirge with thine  Th' earpiercing hern and plover screaming high  While million humming gnats fit oestrum shall supply  IV  Awayawaybehold an hideous band  An herd of all thy minions are at hand  Suspicion first with jealous caution stalks  And ever looks around her as she walks  With bibulous ear imperfect sounds to catch  And prompt to listen at her neighbours latch  Next Scandal's meagre shade  Foe to the virgins and the poet's fame  A wither'd timedeflow'red old maid  That ne'er enjoy'd love's ever sacred flame  Hypocrisy succeeds with saintlike look  And elevates her hands and plods upon her book  Next comes illiberal scrambling Avarice  Then Vanity and Affectation nice  See she salutes her shadow with a bow  As in short Gallic trips she minces by  Starting antipathy is in her eye  And squeamishly she knits her scornful brow  To thee IllNature all the numerous group  With lowly reverence stoop  They wait thy call and mourn thy long delay  Awaythou art infectioushaste away  A MORNING PIECE OR AN HYMN for the HAYMAKERS ODE I  Quinetiam Gallum noctem explaudentibus alis  Auroram clarâ consuetum voce vocare  LUCRET  BRISK chaunticleer his mattins had begun  And broke the silence of the night  And thrice he call'd aloud the tardy sun  And thrice he hail'd the dawn's ambiguous light  Back to their graves the fearbegotten phantoms run  Strong Labour got up with his pipe in his mouth  And stoutly strode over the dale  He lent new perfumes to breath of the south  On his back hung his wallet and flail  Behind him came Health from her cottage of thatch  Where never physician had lifted the latch  First of the village Colin was awake  And thus he sung reclining on his rake  Now the rural graces three  Dance beneath yon maple tree  First the vestal Virtue known  By her adamantine zone  Next to her in rosy pride  Sweet Society the bride  Last Honesty full seemly drest  In her cleanly homespun vest  The abby bells in wak'ning rounds  The warning peal have giv'n  And pious Gratitude resounds  Her morning hymn to heav'n  All nature wakesthe birds unlock their throats  And mock the shepherd's rustic notes  All alive o'er the lawn  Full glad of the dawn  The little lambkins play  Sylvia and Sol ariseand all is day  Come my mates let us work  And all hands to the fork  While the Sun shines our Haycocks to make  So fine is the Day  And so fragrant the Hay  That the Meadow's as blithe as the Wake  Our voices let's raise  In Phoebus's praise  Inspir'd by so glorious a theme  Our musical words  Shall be join'd by the birds  And we'll dance to the tune of the stream  A NOONPIECE OR The MOWERS at Dinner ODE II  Jam pastor umbras cum grege languido  Rivumque fessus quaerit horridi  Dumeta Silvani caretque  Ripa vagis taciturna ventis  HOR  THE Sun is now too radiant to behold  And vehement he sheds his liquid Rays of Gold  No cloud appears thro' all the wide expanse  And short but yet distinct and clear  To the wanton whistling air  The mimic shadows dance  Fat Mirth and Gallantry the gay  And romping Extasy 'gin play  Now Myriads of young Cupids rise  And open all their joybright eyes  Filling with infant prate the grove  And lisp in sweetlyfault'ring love  In the middle of the ring  Mad with May and wild of wing  Fireey'd Wantonness shall sing  By the rivulet on the rushes  Beneath a canopy of bushes  Where the everfaithful Tray  Guards the dumplings and the whey  Colin Clout and Yorkshire Will  From the leathern bottle swill  Their scythes upon the adverse bank  Glitter 'mongst th' entangled trees  Where the hazles form a rank  And court'sy to the courting breeze  Ah Harriot sovereign mistress of my heart  Could I thee to these meads decoy  New grace to each fair object thou'dst impart  And heighten ev'ry scene to perfect joy  On a bank of fragrant thyme  Beneath you stately shadowy pine  We'll with the welldisguised hook  Cheat the tenants of the brook  Or where coy Daphne's thickest shade  Drives amorous Phoebus from the glade  There read Sydney's highwrought stories  Of ladies charms and heroes glories  Thence fir'd the sweet narration act  And kiss the fiction into fact  Or satiate with nature's random scenes  Let's to the gardens regulated greens  Where taste and elegance command  Art to lend her daedal hand  Where Flora's flock by nature wild  To discipline are reconcil'd  And laws and order cultivate  Quite civiliz'd into a state  From the sun and from the show'r  Haste we to you boxen bow'r  Secluded from the teizing pry  Of Argus' curiosity  There while Phoebus' golden mean  The gay meridian is seen  Ere decays the lamp of light  And length'ning shades stretch out to night  Seize seize the hinteach hour improve  This is morality in love  Lend lend thine handO let me view  Thy parting breasts sweet avenue  Thenthen thy lips the coral cell  Where all th' ambrosial kisses dwell  Thus we'll each sultry noon employ  In daydreams of exstatic joy  A NIGHTPIECE OR MODERN PHILOSOPHY ODE III  Dicetur meritâ nox quoque noeniâ  HOR  'TWAS when bright Cynthia with her silver car  Soft stealing from Endymion's bed  Had call'd forth ev'ry glitt'ring star  And up th' ascent of heav'n her brilliant host had led  Night with all her negro train  Took possession of the plain  In an hearse she rode reclin'd  Drawn by screechowls slow and blind  Close to her with printless feet  Crept Stillness in a winding sheet  Next to her deaf Silence was seen  Treading on tip toes over the green  Softly lightly gently she trips  Still holding her fingers seal'd to her lips  You could not see a sight  You could not hear a sound  But what confess'd the night  And horror deepen'd round  Beneath a myrtle's melancholy shade  Sophron the wise was laid  And to the

verse makes many more in prose  'Tis with our judgments as our watches none  Go just alike yet each believes his own  In poets as true genius is but rare  True taste as seldom is the critic's share  Both must alike from heav'n derive their light  These born to judge as well as those to write  Qui scribit artificiose ab aliis commode scripta facile intelligere poterit  CIC ad Herenn b  Let such

good sense defac'd  Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools  And some made coxcombs nature meant but fools  In search of wit those lose their common sense  And then turn criticks in their own defence  Each burns alike who can or cannot write  Or with a rival's or an eunuch's spite  All fools have still an itching to deride  And fain wou'd be upon the laughing side  If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spight  There are who judge still worse than he can write  Some have at first for wits then poets past  Turn'd criticks next and prov'd plain fools at last  Some neither can for wits or criticks pass  As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass  Those halflearn'd witlings num'rous in our isle  As halfform'd insects on the banks of Nile  Unfinish'd things one knows not what to call

all things fix'd the limits fit  And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit  As on the land while here the ocean gains  In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains  Thus in the soul while memory prevails  The solid pow'r of understanding fails  Where beams of warm imagination play  The memory's soft figures melt away  One science only will one genius fit  So vast is art so narrow human wit  Not only bounded to peculiar arts  But oft in those confin'd to single parts  Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before  By vain ambition still to make them more  Each might his several province

or wrong  In the bright muse tho' thousand charms conspire  Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire  Who haunt Parnassus but to please the ear  Not mend their minds as some to church repair  Not for the doctrine but the music there  These equal syllables alone require  Tho'  Fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones quae vastam atque hiantem orationem reddunt  Cic ad Herenn lib  oft the ear the open vowels tire  While expletives their feeble aid do join  And ten low words oft creep in one dull line  While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes  With sure returns of stillexpected rhymes  Where'er you find the cooling western breeze  In the next line it whispers thro' the trees  If crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep  The reader's threat'ned not in vain with sleep  Then at the last and only couplet fraught  With some unmeaning thing they call a thought  A needless Alexandrine ends the song  That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along  Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know  What's roundly smooth or languishingly slow  And praise the easy vigour of a line  Where Denham's strength and Waller's sweetness join  True ease in writing comes from art not chance  As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance  'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence  The sound must seem an echo to the sense  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows  But when loud billows lash the sounding shore  The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar  When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw  The line too labours and the words move slow  Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain  Flies o'er th' unbending corn and skims along the main  Hear how  Alexander's feast or the power of music an ode by Mr Dryden  Timotheus various lays surprize  And bid alternate passions fall and rise  While at each change the son of Lybian Jove  Now burns with glory and then melts with love  Now fierce his eyes with sparkling fury glow  Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found  And the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound  The pow'r of music all our hearts allow  And what Timotheus was is Dryden now  Avoid extremes and shun the fault of such  Who still are pleas'd too little or too much  At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence  That always shows great pride or little sense  Those heads as stomachs are not sure the best  Which nauseate all and nothing can digest  Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move  For fools admire but men of sense approve  As things seem large which we thro' mists descry  Dulness is ever apt to magnify  Some the French writers some our own despise  The ancients only or the moderns prize  Thus wit like faith by each man is apply'd  To one small sect and all are damn'd beside  Meanly they seek the blessing to confine  And force that sun but on a part to shine  Which not alone the southern wit sublimes  But ripens spirits in cold northern climes  Which from the first has shone on ages past  Enlights the present and shall warm the last  Tho' each may feel increases and decays  And see now clearer and now darker days  Regard not then if wit be old or new  But blame the false and value still the true  Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own  But catch the speading notion of the town  They reason and conclude by precedent  And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent  Some judge of authors names not works and then  Nor praise nor blame the writings but the men  Of all this servile herd the worst is he  Who in proud dulness joins with quality  A constant critic at the great man's board  To fetch and carry nonsense for my lord  Wh  t woful stuff this madrigal wou'd be  In some starved hackney sonneteer or me  But let a lord once own the happy lines  How the wit brightens how the style refines  Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault  And each exalted stanza steems with thought  The vulgar thus thro' imitation err  As oft the learn'd by being singular  So much they scorn the croud that if the throng  By chance go right they purposely go wrong  So schismatics the plain believers quit  And are but damn'd for having too much wit  Some blame at morning what they praise at night  But always think the last opinion right  A muse by these is like a mistress us'd  This hour she's idoliz'd the next abus'd  While their weak heads like towns unfortify'd  'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side  Ask them the cause they're wiser still they say  And still tomorrow's wiser than today  We think our fathers fools so wise we grow  Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so  Once schooldivines this zealous isle oe'erspread  Who knew most sentences was deepest read  Faith gospel all seem'd made to be disputed  And none had sense enough to be confuted  Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain  Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Ducklane  If faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn  What wonder modes in wit shou'd take their turn  Oft leaving what is natural and fit  The current folly proves the ready wit  And authors think their reputation safe  Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh  Some valuing those of their own side or mind  Still make themselves the measure of mankind  Fondly we think we honour merit then  When we but praise ourselves in other men  Parties in wit attend on those of state  And public faction doubles private hate  Pride malice folly against Dryden rose  In various shapes of parsons critics beaus  But sense surviv'd when merry jests were past  For rising merit will buoy up at last  Might he return and bless once more our eyes  New Blackmores and new Milbournes must arise  Nay shou'd great Homer lift his awful head  Zoilus again wou'd start up from the dead  Envy will merit as its shade pursue  But like a shadow proves the substance true  For envy'd wit like Sol eclips'd makes known  Th' opposing body's grossness not its own  When first the sun too pow'rful beams displays  It draws up vapours which obscure the rays  But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way  Reflect new glories and augment the day  Be thou the first true merit to befriend  His praise is lost who stays till all commend  Short is the date alas of modern rhymes  And 'tis but just to let them live betimes  No longer now that golden age appears  When patriarchwits surviv'd a thousand years  Now length of fame our second life is lost  And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast  Our sons their fathers failing language see  And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be  So when the faithful pencil has design'd  Some bright idea of the master's mind  Where a new world leaps out at his command  And ready nature waits upon his hand  When the ripe colours soften and unite  And sweetly melt into just shade and light  When mellowing years their full perfection give  And each bold figure just begins to live  The treach'rous colours the fair art betray  And all the bright creation fades away  Unhappy wit like most mistaken things  Attones not for the envy which it brings  In youth alone its empty praise we boast  But soon the shortliv'd vanity is lost  Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies  That gaily blooms but ev'n in blooming dies  What is this wit which most our cares employ  The owner's wife that other men enjoy  Still most our trouble when the most admir'd  The more we give the more is still requir'd  The fame with pains we gain but lose with ease  Sure some to vex but never all to please  'Tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun  By fools 'tis hated and by knaves undone  If wit so much from ign'rance undergo  Ah let not learning too commence its foe  Of old those met rewards who cou'd excel  And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well  Tho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due  Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldier too  Now they who reach Parnassus lofty crown  Employ their pains to spurn some others down  And while selflove each jealous writer rules  Contending wits become the sport of fools  But still the worst with most regret commend  For each ill author is as bad a friend  To what base end and by what abject ways  Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise  Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast  Nor in the critic let the man be lost  Goodnature and goodsense must ever join  To err is human to forgive divine  But if in noble minds some dregs remain  Not yet purg'd off of spleen and sour disdain  Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes  Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times  No pardon vile obscenity shou'd find  Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind  But dulness with obscenity must prove  As shameful sure as impotence in love  In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease  Sprung the rank weed and thriv'd with large increase  When love was all an easy monarch's care  Seldom at a council never in a war  Jilts rul'd the state and statesmen farces writ  Nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit  The fair sate panting at a courtier's play  And not a mask went unimprov'd away  The modest fan was lifted up no more  And virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before  The following licence of a foreign reign  Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain  Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation  And taught more pleasant methods of salvation  Where heaven's free subjects might their rights dispute  Lest God himself should seem too absolute  Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare  And vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there  Encourag'd thus wit's Titans brav'd the skies  And the press groan'd with licenc'd blasphemies  These monsters critics with your darts engage  Here point your thunder and exhaust your rage  Yet shun their fault who scandalously nice  Will needs mistake an author into vice  All seems infected that th' infected spy  As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye  Learn then what morals critics ought to show  For 'tis but half a judge's task to know  'Tis not enough wit art and learning join  In all you speak let truth and candour shine  That not alone what to your judgment's due  All may allow but seek your friendship too  Be silent always when you doubt your sense  And speak tho' sure with seeming diffidence  Some positive persisting fops we know  That if once wrong will needs be always so  But you with pleasure own your errors past  And make each day a critic on the last  'Tis not enough your counsel still be true  Blunt truths more mischief than nice falshoods do  Men must be taught as if you taught 'em not  And things unknown propos'd as things forgot  Without goodbreeding truth is disapprov'd  That only makes superior sense belov'd  Be niggards of advice on no pretence  For the worst avarice is that of sense  With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust  Nor be so civil as to prove unjust  Fear most the anger of the wise to raise  Those best can bear reproof who merit praise  'Twere well might critics still this freedom take  But Appius reddens at each word you speak  And stares tremendous with a threat'ning eye  Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry  Fear most to tax an honourable fool  Whose right it is uncensur'd to be dull  Such without wit are poets when they please  As without learning they can take degrees  Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful satyrs  And flattery to fulsome dedicators  Whom when they praise the world believes no more  Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er  'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain  And charitably let the dull be vain  Your silence there is better than your spite  For who can rail so long as they can write  Still humming on their drowsy course they keep  And lash'd so long like tops are lash'd asleep  False steps but help them to renew the race  As after stumbling jades will mend their pace  What crouds of these impertinently bold  In sounds and jing'ling syllables grown old  Still run on poets in a raging vein  Ev'n to the dregs and squeezings of the brain  Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense  And rhyme with all the rage of impotence  Such shameless bards we have and yet 'tis true  There are as mad abandon'd critics too  The bookfull blockhead ignorantly read  With loads of learned lumber in his head  With his own tongue still edifies his ears  And always listning to himself appears  All books he reads and all he reads assails  From Dryden's fables down to Durfy's tales  With him most authors steal their works or buy  Garth did not write his own dispensary  Name a new play and he's the poet's friend  Nay show'd his faultsbut when wou'd poets mend  No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd  Nor is Paul'schurch more safe than Paul'schurchyard  Nay fly to altars there he'll talk you dead  For fools rush in where angels fear to tread  Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks  It still looks home and short excursions makes  But rattling nonsense in full vollies breaks  And never shock'd and never turn'd aside  Bursts out resistless with a thund'ring tide  But where's the man who counsel can bestow  Still pleas'd to teach and yet not proud to know  Unbias'd or by favour or by spite  Not dully prepossess'd or blindly right  Tho' learn'd wellbred and tho' wellbred sincere  Modestly bold and humanely severe  Who to a friend his faults can freely show  And gladly praise the merit of a foe  Blest with a taste exact and unconfin'd  A knowledge both of books and human kind  Gen'rous converse a soul exempt from pride  And love to praise with reason on his side  Such once were critics such the happy few  Athens and Rome in better ages knew  The mighty Stagyrite first left the shore  Spread all his sails and durst the deep explore  He steer'd securely and discover'd far  Led by the light of the Maeonian star  Poets a race long unconfin'd and free  Still fond and proud of savage liberty  Receiv'd his laws and stood convinc'd 'twas fit  Who conquer'd nature should preside o'er wit  Horace still charms with graceful negligence  And without method talks us into sense  Will like a friend familiarly convey  The truest notions in the easiest way  He who supreme in judgment as in wit  Might boldly censure as he boldly writ  Yet judg'd with coolness tho' he sung with fire  His precepts teach but what his works inspire  Our critics take a contrary extreme  They judge with fury but they write with phlegm  Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations  By wits than critics in as wrong quotations  See Dionysius  Dionysius of Halicarnassus  Homer's thoughts refine  And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line  Fancy and art in gay Petronius please  The scholar's learning with the courtier's ease  In grave Quintilian's copious work we find  The justest rules and clearest method join'd  Thus useful arms in magazines we place  All rang'd in order and dispos'd with grace  Nor thus alone the curious eye to please  But to be found when need requires with ease  Thee bold Longinus all the Nine inspire  And bless their critic with a poet's fire  An ardent judge who zealous in his trust  With warmth gives sentence yet is always just  Whose own example strengthens all his laws  And is himself that great sublime he draws  Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd  Licence repress'd and useful laws ordain'd  Learning and Rome alike in empire grew  And arts still follow'd where her eagles flew  From the same foes at last both felt their doom  And the same age saw learning fall and Rome  With tyranny then superstition join'd  As that the body this enslav'd the mind  Much was believ'd but little understood  And to be dull was constru'd to be good  A second deluge learning thus o'errun  And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun  At length Erasmus that great injur'd name  The glory of the priesthood and the shame  Stemn'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age  And drove those holy Vandals off the stage  But see each muse in Leo's golden days  Starts from her trance and trims her wither'd bays  Rome's ancient genius o'er its ruins spread  Shakes off the dust and rears his rev'rend head  Then Sculpture and her sister arts revive  Stones leap'd to form and rocks began to live  With sweeter notes each rising temple rung  A Raphael painted and a  Hieronymus Vida an excellent Latin poet who writ an art of poetry in verse He flourish'd in the time of Leo the tenth  Vida sung  Immortal Vida on whose honour'd brow  The poets bays and critics ivy grow  Cremona now shall ever boast thy name  As next in place to Mantua next in fame  But soon by impious arms from Latium chac'd  Their ancient bounds the banish'd muses past  Thence arts o'er all the northern world advance  But critic learning flourish'd most in France  The rules a nation born to serve obeys  And Boileau still in right of Horace sways  But we brave Britons foreign laws despis'd  And kept unconquer'd and unciviliz'd  Fierce for the liberties of wit and bold  We still desy'd the Romans as of old  Yet some there were among the founder few  Of those who less presum'd and better knew  Who durst assert the juster ancient cause  And here restor'd wit's fundamental laws  Such was the muse whose rules and practice tell  Nature's  Essay on poetry by the duke of Buckingham  chief masterpiece is writing well  Such was Roscommonnot more learn'd than good  With manners gen'rous as his noble blood  To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known  And ev'ry author's merit but his own  Such late was Walshthe muse's judge and friend  Who justly knew to blame or to commend  To failings mild but zealous for desert  The clearest head and the sincerest heart  This humble praise lamented shade receive  This praise at least a grateful muse may give  The muse whose early voice you taught to sing  Prescrib'd her heights and prun'd her tender wing  Her guide now lost no more pretends to rise  But in low numbers short excursions tries  Content if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view  The learn'd reflect on what before they knew  Careless of censure nor too fond of fame  Still pleas'd to praise yet not afraid to blame  Averse alike to flatter or offend  Not free from faults nor yet too vain to mend  DE ARTE CRITICA  DICTU difficile est an sit dementia major  Egisse invitâ vatem criticumne Minervâ  Ille tamen

M  SAY what uncommon cares disturb my rest  And kindle raptures foreign to my breast  From earth's low confines lift my mind on high  To trace new worlds revolving in the sky  YesI'm impatient of this orb of clay  And boldly dare to meditate my way  Where Fontinelle first saw the planets roll  And all the God tumultuous shakes my soul  'Tis He He comes and thro' the sunbright skies  Drives foaming Pegasus and thus he cries  "Cease cease dear youth too studiously employ'd  "And wing with me the unresisting void  "'Tis thine with me round other worlds to soar  "And visit kingdoms never known before  "While I succinctly shew each various race  "The manners and the genius of the place"  I tho' my mind with lively horror fraught  Thinks on Bellerophon and shudders at the thought  Mount quick the winged steed he springs he flies  Shoots thro' the yielding air and cleaves the liquid skies  First swift Cyllenius circling round the sun  We reach when thus my friendly guide begun  "Mark well the genius of this fiery place  "The wild amusements of the brainsick race  "Whose minds the beams of Titan too intense  "Affect with frenzy and distract the sense  "A monarch here gives subject princes law  "A mighty monarch with a crown of straw  "There fits a lover sad in pensive air  "And like the dismal image of despair  "With charcoal paints his Chloe heav'nly fair  "In sadlysoothing strain rude notes he sings  "And strikes harsh numbers from the jarring strings  "Lo an astrologer with filth besmear'd  "Rough and neglected with a length of beard  "Pores round his cell for undiscover'd stars  "And decks the wall with triangles and squares  "LoBut the radiant car of Phoebus nigh  "Glows with red ardour and inflames the sky  "Oh waft me hide me in some cool retreat  "I faint I sicken with the fervent heat"  Thence to that milder orb we wing our way  Where Venus governs with an easy sway  Soft breathes the air fair Flora paints the ground  And laughing Ceres deals her gifts around  This blissful  Tempe  no rough blasts molest  Of blust'ring Boreas or the baleful East  But gentle Zephyrs o'er the woodlands stray  Court the tall trees and round the branches play  AEtherial gales dispensing as they flow  To fan those passions which they teach to glow  Here the gay youth in measur'd steps advance  While sprightly music animates the dance  There the sweet melody of sound admire  Sigh with the song or languish to the lyre  Fair nymphs and amorous youths a lovely band  Blend in the dance lightbounding hand in hand  From ev'ry grove the buxom Zephyrs bring  The rich ambrosia of eternal spring  Care dwells not here their pleasures to destroy  But Laughter Jest and universal joy  All all is love for Venus reigns confest  The sole sultana of each captive breast  Cold Cynthia here wou'd Cupid's victim prove  Or the chaste daughter of imperial Jove  And Cato's virtue be the slave of love  But now thro' destin'd fields of air we fly  And leave those mansions not without a sigh  Thence the dire coast we reach the dreary plains  Where Mars grim god and bloody discord reigns  The host in arms embattled sternly stands  The sword the dart the dagger in their hands  Here no fair nymphs to silver sounds advance  But buskin'd heroes form the Pyrrhic dance  And brazen trumpets terrible from far  With martial music fire the soul to war  Here the lone bride be wails her absent lord  The sterile nuptials the deserted board  Sighs the long nights and frantic with despair  Beats her bare breast and rends her flowing hair  In vain she sighs in vain dissolves in tears  In sleep perhaps the warrior lord appears  A fleeting form that glides before her sight  A momentary vision of the night  Mean while regardless of her anxious pray'r  The hardy husband sternly stalks to war  Our ears the clang of ringing armour rends  And the immortal battle never ends  Hence thro' the boundless void we nimbly move  And reach the wideextended plains of Jove  Here the stern tyrant sways an iron rod  A thousand vassals tremble at his nod  How short the period of a tyrant's date  The pois'nous phial speeds the work of fate  Scarce is the proud imperious tyrant dead  But lo a second lords it in his stead  Here peace as common merchandize is sold  Heav'n's first best blessing for pernicious gold  War soon succeeds the sturdy squadrons stand  Wide o'er the fields a formidable band  With num'rous fleets they croud the groaning main  And triumph for the victories they feign  Again in strict alliances unite  Till discord raise again the phantom of a fight  Again they sail again the troops prepare  Their falchions for the mockery of war  The son inhuman seeks his father's life  The slave his master's and her lord's the wife  With vengeance thus their kindling bosoms fire  Since Jove usurp'd the sceptre of his fire  Thence poisons perjuries and bribes betray  Nor other passions do their souls obey  Than thirst of gold and avarice of sway  At length we land vast fields of aether crost  On Saturn's cold uncomfortable coast  Here in the gloom the pamper'd sluggards lull  The lazy hours lethargically dull  In caves they live for who was ever known  So wise so sedulous to build a town  The same stupidity infects the whole  Fix'd in the breast and center'd in the soul  These never feel th' ambitious fires of Jove  To Industry not Mercury can move  Mars cannot spur to war nor Venus woo to love  Here rove those souls 'tis said when life departs  Who never cultivated useful arts  But stupify'd with plenty and repose  Dreamt out long life in one continued dose  No feather'd songsters with sweetwarbled strains  Attune to melting melody the plains  No flocks widepast'ring bleat nor oxen low  No fountains musically murm'ring flow  Th' ungenial waste no tender herbage yields  No harvests wave luxuriant in the fields  Low lie the groves if groves this land can boast  Chain'd in the fetters of eternal frost  Their beauty wither'd and their verdure lost  Dull animals inhabit this abode  The owl mole dormouse tortoise and the toad  Dull rivers deep within their channels glide  And slow roll on their tributary tide  Nor aught th' unvegetative waters feed  But sleepy poppy and the slimy reed  Whose lazy fogs like Lethe's cups dispense  Eternal slumbers of dull indolence  Agast I stood the drowsy vapours lull  My soul in gloom ev'n Pegasus grew dull  My guide observ'd and thrice he urg'd his speed  Thrice the loud lash resounded from the steed  Fir'd at the strokes he flies with slacken'd rein  Swift o'er the level of the liquid plain  Glides with the gentle gale and lights on earth again  THE TEMPLE OF DULNESS  Translated by the same Hand  Materies gaudet vi Inertiae  VErvecum in patria quà latè Hibernica squalent

Full many a fen infests the putrid shore  And many a gulph the melancholy moor  Let not the stranger in these regions stray  Dark is the sky and perilous the way  Beneath his footsteps shakes the trembling ground  Dense fogs and exhalations hover round  And with black clouds the tender turf is crown'd  Here shou'd'st thou rove by Fate's severe command  And safely reach the center of the land  Thine eyes shall view with horror and surprize  The fane of Dulness of enormous size  Emerging from the sable cloud arise  A leaden tow'r upheaves its heavy head  Vast leaden arches press the slimy bed  The soft soil swells beneath the load of lead  Old Matter here erected this abode  At Folly's impulse to the Slothful God  And here the drone lethargic loves to stay  Slumb'ring the dull inactive hours away  For still unless by foreign force imprest  The languid Goddess holds her state of rest  Their habitation here those monsters keep  Whom Matter father'd on the God of Sleep  Here Zoilus with cank'ring envy pale  Here Maevius bids his brother Bavius hail  Spinoza Epicure and all those mobs  Of wicked wits from Pyrrho down to Hobbes  How can the Muse recount the numerous crew  Of frequent fools that crowd upon the view  Nor can learn'd Albion's sun that burns so clear  Disperse the dulness that involves them here  Boeotia thus remain'd in days of yore  Senseless and stupid tho' the neighb'ring shore  Afforded salutary hellebore  No cure exhal'd from Zephyr's buxom breeze  That gently brush'd the bosom of the seas  As oft to Lesbian fields he wing'd his way  Fanning fair Flora and in airy play  Breath'd balmy sighs that melt the soul away  Behold that portico how vast how wide  The pillars Gothic wrought with barb'rous pride  Four monstrous shapes before the portal wait  Of horrid aspect centry to the gate  Lo in the entrance with disdainful eye  In Logick's dark disguise stands Sophistry  Her very front would common sense confound  Encompass'd with ten categories round  She from Old Matter the great mother came  By birth the eldestand how like the dame  Her shrivel'd skin small eyes prodigious pate  Denote her shrewd and subtle in debate  This hand a net and that sustains a club  T' entangle her antagonist or drub  The spider's toils all o'er her garment spread  Imply the mazy errors of her head  Behold her marching with funereal pace  Slow as old Saturn rolls thro' boundless space  Slow as the mighty mountains mov'd along  When Orpheus rais'd the lyreattended song  Or as at Oxford on some Gaudy day  Fat Beadles in magnificent array  With big round bellies bear the pond'rous treat  And heavily lag on with the vast load of meat  The next mad Mathesis her feet all bare  Ungirt untrim'd with dissoluted hair  No foreign object can her thoughts disjoint  Reclin'd she sits and ponders o'er a point  Before her lo inscrib'd upon the ground  Strange diagrams th' astonish'd sight confound  Right lines and curves with figures square and round  With these the monster arrogant and vain  Boasts that she can all mysteries explain  And treats the sacred Sisters with disdain  She when great Newton sought his kindred skies  Sprung high in air and strove with him to rise  In vainthe mathematic mob restrains  Her flight indignant and on earth detains  E'er since the captive wretch her brains employs  On trifling trinkets and on gewgaw toys  Microphile is station'd next in place  The spurious issue of celestial race  From heav'nly Physice she took her birth  Her sire a madman of the sons of earth  On flies she pores with keen unwearied sight  And moths and butterflies her dear delight  Mushrooms and flow'rs collected on a string  Around her neck around her temples cling  With all the strange production of the spring  With greedy eyes she'll search the world to find  Rare uncouth animals of every kind  Whether along the humble ground they stray  Or nimbly sportive in the waters play  Or thro' the light expanse of aether fly  And with fleet pinions cleave the liquid sky  Ye gales that gently breathe upon our shore  O let the Polypus be wasted o'er  How will the hollow dome of Dulness ring  With what loud joy receive the wond'rous thing  Applause will rend the skies and all around  The quivering quagmires bellow back the sound  How will Microphile her joy attest  And glow with warmer raptures than the rest  This will the curious crocodile excell  The weaving worm and silvershining shell  No object e'er will wake her wonder thus  As Polypus her darling Polypus  Lo by the wounds of her creating knife  New Polypusses wriggle into life  Fast as they rise she feeds with ample store  Of once rare flies but now esteem'd no more  The fourth dire shape from mother Matter came  Dulness her sire and Atheism is her name  In her no glimpse of sacred Sense appears  Depriv'd of eyes and destitute of ears  And yet she brandishes a thousand tongues  And blasts the world with airinfecting lungs  Curs'd by her sire her very words are wounds  No grove reecchoes the detested sounds  Whate'er she speaks all nature proves a lye  The earth the heav'ns the starryspangled sky  Proclaim the wise eternal Deity  The congregated waves in mountains driven  Roar in grand chorus to the Lord of Heaven  Thro' skies serene the glorious thunders roll  Loudly pronounce the God and shake the sounding Pole  A river murmuring from Lethaean source  Full to the fane directs its sleepy course  The Pow'r of Dulness leaning on the brink  Here calls the multitude of fools to drink  Swarming they crowd to stupify the

Momus the Mimic of the Gods above  In his mock mood impertinently spoke  About the birth some low ridiculous joke  Jove sternly frowning glow'd with vengeful ire  And thus Indignant said th' Almighty Sire  "Loquacious Slave that laugh'st without a cause  "Thou shalt conceive and bring forth at thy jaws"  He spokestretch'd in the hall the Mimic lies  Supinely dull thick vapours dim his eyes  And as his jaws a horrid chasm disclose  It seem'd he made a trumpet of his nose  Tho' harsh the strain and horrible to hear  Like German jargon grating on the ear  At length was Polychasmia brought to light  Worthy her sire a monster of a sight  Resembling her great grandmother Old Night  Her eyes to open oft in vain she try'd  Lock'd were the lids her mouth distended wide  Her when Prometheus happen'd to survey  Rival of Jove that made mankind of clay  He form'd without the aid of heav'nly ray  To three Lethaean cups he learnt to mix  Deep sighs of virgins with three blasts from Styx  The bray of asses with the fat of brawn  The sleeppreceding groan and hideous yawn  Thus Polychasmia took her wond'rous birth  A Goddess helpful to the sons of earth  Lo how the rustic multitude from far  Haste to the town and crowd the clam'rous bar  The prest bench groans with many a squire and knight  Who weight out justice and distribute right  Severe they seem and formidably big  With front important and huge periwig  The little villains skulk aloof dismay'd  And panic terrors seize the pregnant maid  But soon friend Polychasm' who always near  Herself had mingled with their morning beer  Steals to the judges brain and centers there  Then in the court the horrid yawn began  And Hum profound and solemn went from man to man  Silent they nod and with prodigious strain  Stretch out their arms then listless yawn again  For all the flow'rs of rhetoric they can boast  Amidst their wranglings is to gape the most  Ambiguous quirks and friendly wrath they vent  And give and take the leaden argument  Ye too Fanaticks never shall escape  The faithful muse for who so greatly gape  Mounted on high with serious care perplext  The miserable preacher takes his text  Then into parts minute with wondrous pain  Divides connects and then divides again  And does with grave obscurity explain  While from his lips lean periods lingring creep  And not one meaning interrupts their sleep  The drowsy hearers stretch their weary jaws  With lamentable groan and yawning gape applause  The Quacks of Physic next provoke my ire  Who falsely boast Hippocrates their sire  Goddess thy sons I kenverbose and loud  They puff their windy bubbles on the crowd  With look important critical and vain  Each to his nose applies the gilded cane  And as he nods and ponders o'er the case  Gravely collects himself into his face  Explains his med'cineswhich the rustic buys  Drinks the dire draught and of the doctor dies  No pills no potions can to life restore  ABRACADABRA necromantic pow'r  Can charm and conjure up from death no more  But more than aught that's marvellous and rare  The studious Soph makes Polychasm' his care  Explores what secret spring what hidden cause  Distends with hideous chasm th' unwilling jaws  What latent ducts the dewy moisture pour  With sound tremendous like a thundershow'r  How subtile matter exquisitely thin  Pervades the curious network of the skin  Affects th' accordant nerveall eyes are drown'd  In drowsy vapours and the yawn goes round▪  When Phoebus thus his flying fingers flings  Across the chords and sweeps the trembling strings  If e'er a lyre at unison there be  It swells with emulating harmony  Like Memnon's harp in ancient times renown'd  Breathing untouch'd sweetmodulated sound  But oh ungrateful to thy own true bard  Oh Polychasm' is this my just reward  Thy drowsy dews upon my head distill  Just at the entrance of th' Aonian hill  Listless I gape unactive and supine  And at vast distance view the sacred Nine  Wistful I viewthe streams increase my thirst  In vainlike Tantalus with plenty curst  No draughts nectareous to my portion fall  These godlike Pope exhausts and greatly claims them all  Thus the lean Sizar views with gaze agast  The hungry Tutor at his noon's repast  In vain he grinds his teethhis grudging eye  And visage sharp keen appetite imply  Oft he attempts officious to convey  The lessening relicks of the meal away  In vainno morsel 'scapes the greedy jaw  All all is gorg'd in magisterial maw  Till at the last observant of his word  The lamentable waiter clears the board  And inlymurmuring miserably groans  To see the empty dish and hear the sounding bones  A LATIN VERSION OF MILTON's L'ALLEGRO  HOM  L'ALLEGRO  HENCE loathed Melancholy  Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born  In Stygian cave forlorn  Mongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy  Find out some uncouth cell  Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings  And the nightraven sings  There under ebon shades and lowbrow'd rocks  As ragged as thy locks  In dark Cimmerian desart ever dwell  But come thou Goddess fair and free  In Heav'n yclep'd Euphrosyne  And by men hearteasing Mirth  Whom lovely Venus at a birth  With two sister Graces more  To ivycrowned Bacchus bore  Or whether as some Sages sing  The frolick wind that breathes the spring  Zephyr with Aurora playing  As he met her once a Maying  There on beds of violets blue  And fresh blown roses wash'd in dew  Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair  So buxom blith and debonair  Haste thee Nymph and bring with thee  Jest and youthful Jollity  Quips and cranks and wanton wiles  Nods and becks and wreathed smiles  Such as hang on Hebe's cheek  And love to live in dimple sleek  Sport that wrinkled Care derides  And Laughter holding both his sides  Come and trip it as you go  On the light fantastic toe  And in thy right hand lead with thee  The mountain Nymph sweet Liberty  And if I give thee honour due  Mirth admit me of thy crew  To live with her and live with thee  In unreproved pleasures free  To hear the lark begin his flight  And singing startle the dull night  From his watchtow'r in the skies  Till the dappled dawn doth rise  Then to come in spight of sorrow  And at my window bid goodmorrow  Thro' the sweetbriar or the vine  Or the twisted eglantine  While the cock with lively din  Scatters the rear of darkness thin  And to the stack or the barndoor  Stoutly struts his dames before  Oft list'ning how the hounds and horn  Chearly rouse the slumb'ring morn  From the side of some hoar hill  Thro' the high wood echoing shrill  Sometimes walking not unseen  By hedgerow elms on hillocks green  Right against the eastern gate  Where the great sun begins his state  Rob'd in flames and amber light  The clouds in thousand liveries dight  While the plowman near at hand  Whistles o'er the furrow'd land  And the milkmaid singeth blithe  And the mower whets his seythe  And every shepherd tells his tale  Under the hawthorn in the dale  Strait mine eye hath caught new pleasures  Whilst the landskip round it measures  Russet lawns and fallows gray  Where the nibbling flocks do stray  Mountains on whose barren breast  The labouring clouds do often rest  Meadows trim with daizies pide  Shallow brooks and rivers wide  Tow'rs and battlements it sees  Bosom'd high in tufted trees  Where perhaps some beauty lies  The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes  Hard by a cottage chimney smokes  From betwixt two aged oaks  Where Corydon and Thyrsis met  Are at their favory dinner set  Of herbs and other country messes  Which the neathanded Phillis dresses  And then in haste her bower she leaves  With Thestylis to bind the sheaves  Or if the earlier season lead  To the tann'd haycock in the mead  Sometimes with secure delight  The upland Hamlets will invite  When the merry bells ring round  And the jocund rebecks sound  To many a youth and many a maid  Dancing in the chequer'd shade  And young and old come forth to play  On a sunshine holyday  Till the livelong daylight fail  Then to the spicy nutbrown ale  With stories told of many a feat  How fairy Mab the junkets eat  She was pinch'd and pull'd she said  And by the Friar's lanthorn led  Tells how the drudging goblin sweat  To earn his creambowl duly set  When in one night ere glimpse of morn  His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn  That ten daylabourers could not end  Then lies him down the lubbar fiend  And stretch'd out all the chimny's length  Basks at the fire his hairy strength  And cropfull out of doors he flings  Ere the first cock his mattin sings  Thus done the tales to bed they creep  By whispering winds soon lull'd asleep  Towred cities please us then  And the busy humm of men  Where throngs of knights and barons bold  In weeds of peace high triumph hold  With store of ladies whose bright eyes  Rain influence and judge the prize  Of wit or arms while both contend  To win her grace whom all commend  There let Hymen oft appear  In saffron robe with taper clear  And pomp and feast and revelry  With mask and antique pageantry  Such sights as youthful poets dream  On summer eves by haunted stream  Then to the welltrod stage anon  If Johnson's learned sock be on  Or sweetest Shakespear Fancy's child  Warble his native woodnotes wild  And ever against eating cares  Lap me in soft Lydian airs  Married to immortal verse  Such as the meeting soul may pierce  In notes with many a winding bout  Of linked sweetness long drawn out  With wanton heed and giddy cunning  The melting voice thro' mazes running  Untwisting all the chains that tye  The hidden soul of harmony  That Orpheus self may heave his head  From golden slumber on a bed  Of heap'd Elysian flow'rs and hear  Such strains as would have won the ear  Of Pluto to have quite set free  His halfregain'd Eurydice  These delights if thou canst give  Mirth with thee I mean to live  'Ο ΠΑΙΓΝΙΩΔΣ  PROCUL hinc O procul esto informis AEgrimonia  Quam janitori Obscuritas

PIECES  Adhuc supersunt multa quae possim loqui  Et copiosa abundat rerum varietas  PHAEDRUS  SWEET WILLIAM BALLAD I  I  BY a prattling stream on a Midsummer's eve  Where the woodbine and jess'mine their boughs interweave  Fair Flora I cry'd to my arbour repair  For I must have a chaplet for sweet William's hair  II  She brought me the vi'let that grows on the hill  The vale dwelling lilly and gilded jonquill  But such languid odours how cou'd I approve  Just warm from the lips of the lad that I love  III  She brought me his faith and his truth to display  The undying myrtle and evergreen bay  But why these to me who've his constancy known  And Billy has laurels enough of his own  IV  The next was a gift that I could not contemn  For she brought me two roses that grew on a stem  Of the dear nuptial tie they stood emblems confest  So I kiss'd 'em and press'd 'em quite close to my breast  V  She brought me a sunflow'rThis fair one's your due  For it once was a maiden and lovesick like you  Oh give it me quick to my shepherd I'll run  As true to his flame as this flow'r to the sun  The LASS with the golden Locks BALLAD II  I  NO more of my Harriot of Polly no more  Nor all the bright beauties that charm'd me before  My heart for a slave to gay Venus I've sold  And barter'd my freedom for ringlets of gold  I'll throw down my pipe and neglect all my flocks  And will sing to my lass with the golden locks  II  Tho' o'er her white forehead the gilt tresses flow  Like the rays of the sun on a hillock of snow  Such painters of old drew the Queen of the Fair  'Tis the taste of the antients 'tis classical hair  And tho' witlings may scoff and tho' raillery mocks  Yet I'll sing to my lass with the golden locks  III  To live and to love to converse and be free  Is loving my charmer and living with thee  Away go the hours in kisses and rhime  Spite of all the grave lectures of old father Time  A fig for his dials his watches and clocks  He's best spent with the lass of the golden locks  IV  Than the swan in the brook she's more dear to my sight  Her mien is more stately her breast is more white  Her sweet lips are rubies all rubies above  Which are fit for the language or labour of love  At the park in the mall at the play in the box  My lass bears the bell with her golden locks  V  Her beautiful eyes as they roll or they flow  Shall be glad for my joy or shall weep for my woe  She shall ease my fond heart and shall sooth my soft pain  While thousands of rivals are sighing in vain  Let them rail at the fruit they can't reach like the fox  While I have the lass with the golden locks  The DECISION BALLAD III  I  MY Florio wildest of his sex  Who sure the veriest saint wou'd vex  From beauty roves to beauty  Yet tho' abroad the wanton roam  Whene'er he deigns to stay at home  He always minds his duty  II  Something to every charming she  In thoughtless prodigality  He's granting still and granting  To Phyllis that to Cloe this  And every madam every miss  Yet I find nothing wanting  III  If haply I his will displease  Tempestuous as th' autumnal seas  He foams and rages ever  But when he ceases from his ire  I cry such spirit and such fire  Is surely wond'rous clever  IV  I ne'er want reason to complain  But sweet is pleasure after pain  And every joy grows greater  Then trust me damsels whilst I tell  I should not like him half so well  If I cou'd make him better  The TALKATIVE FAIR BALLAD IV  I  FROM morn to night from day to day  At all times and at every place  You scold repeat and sing and say  Nor are there hopes you'll ever cease  II  Fobear my Celia oh forbear  If your own health or ours you prize  For all mankind that hear you swear  Your tongue's more killing than your eyes  III  Your tongue's a traytor to your face  Your fame's by your own noise obscur'd  All are distracted while they gaze  But if they listen they are cur'd  IV  Your silence wou'd acquire more praise  Than all you say or all I write  One look ten thousand charms displays  Then hushand be an angel quite  The SILENT FAIR BALLAD V  I  FROM all her fair loquacious kind  So different is my Rosalind  That not one accent can I gain  To crown my hopes or sooth my pain  II  Ye lovers who can construe sighs  And are the interpreters of eyes  To language all her looks translate  And in her gestures read my fate  III  And if in them you chance to find  Ought that is gentle ought that's kind  Adieu mean hopes of being great  And all the littleness of state  IV  All thoughts of grandeur I'll despise  Which from dependence take their rise  To serve her shall be my employ  And love's sweet agony my joy  The FORCE of INNOCENCE To Miss C  BALLAD VI  I  THE blooming damsel whose defence  Is adamantine innocence  Requires no guardian to attend  Her steps for modesty's her friend  Tho' her fair arms are weak to wield  The glitt'ring spear and massy shield  Yet safe from force and fraud combin'd  She is an Amazon in mind  II  With this artillery she goes  Not only 'mongst the harmless beaux  But even unhurt and undismay'd  Views the long sword and fierce cockade  Tho' all a syren as she talks  And all a goddess as she walks  Yet decency each action guides  And wisdom o'er her tongue presides  III  Place her in Russia's showery plains  Where a perpetual winter reigns  The elements may rave and range  Yet her fix'd mind will never change  Place her Ambition in thy tow'rs  'Mongst the more dang'rous golden show'rs  E'en there she'd spurn the venal tribe  And fold her arms against the bribe  IV  Leave her defenceless and alone  A pris'ner in the torrid zone  The sunshine there might vainly vie  With the bright lustre of her eye  But Phoebus' self with all his fire  Cou'd ne'er one unchaste thought inspire  But virtue's path she'd still pursue  And still my fair wou'd copy you  The DISTRESSED DAMSEL BALLAD VII  I  OF all my experience how vast the amount  Since fifteen long winters I fairly can count  Was ever a damsel so sadly betray'd  To live to these years and yet still be a maid  II  Ye heroes triumphant by land and by sea  Sworn vott'ries to love but undmindful of me  You can strom a strong fort or can form a blockade  Yet ye stand by like dastards and see me a maid  III  Ye lawyers so just who with slippery tongue  Can do what you please or with right or with wrong  Can it be or by law or by equity said  That a buxom young girl ought to die an old maid  IV  Ye learned physicians whose excellent skill  Can save or demolish can cure or can kill  To a poor forlorn damsel contribute your aid  Who is sickvery sickof remaining a maid  V  Ye fops I invoke not to list to my song  Who answer no endand to no sex belong  Ye echoes of echoes and shadows of shade  For if I had youI might still be a maid  The FAIR RECLUSE BALLAD VIII  I  YE ancient patriarchs of the wood  That veil around these awful glooms  Who many a century have stood  In verdant age that ever blooms  II  Ye Gothic tow'rs by vapours dense  Obscur'd into severer state  In pastoral magnificence  At once so simple and so great  III  Why all your jealous shades on me  Ye hoary elders do ye spread  Fair Innocence shou'd still be free  Nought shou'd be chain'd but what we dread  IV  Say must these tears for ever flow  Can I from patience learn content  While solitude still nurses woe  And leaves me leisure to lament  V  My guardian seewho wards off peace  Whose cruelty is his employ  Who bids the tongue of transport cease  And stops each avenue to joy  VI  Freedom of air alone is giv'n  To aggravate not sooth my grief  To view th' immenselydistant heav'n  My nearest prospect of relief  To Miss  one of the Chichester Graces BALLAD IX  Written in Goodwood Gardens September  I  "YE hills that overlook the plains  "Where wealth and Gothic greatness reigns  "Where Nature's hand by Art is check'd  "And Taste herself is architect  "Ye fallows grey ye forests brown  "And seas that the vast prospect crown  "Ye freight the soul with fancy's store  "Nor can she one idea more"  II  I saidwhen dearest of her kind  Her form the picture of her mind  Chloris approach'dThe landskip flew  All nature vanish'd from my view  She seem'd all Nature to comprize  Her lips her beauteous breasts her eyes  That rous'd and yet abash'd desire  With liquid languid living fire  III  But thenher voicehow fram'd t' endear  The music of the Gods to hear  Wit that so pierc'd without offence  So brac'd by the strong nerves of sense  Pallas with Venus play'd her part  To rob me of an honest heart  Prudence and Passion jointly strove  And Reason was th' ally of Love  IV  Ah me thou sweet delicious maid  From whence shall I sollicit aid  Hope and despair alike destroy  One kills with grief and one with joy  Celestial Chloris Nymph divine  To save me the dear task be thine  Tho' conquest be the woman's care  The angel's glory is to spare  The PHYSICIAN and the MONKEY An EPIGRAM  A LADY sent lately to one Doctor Drug  To come in an instant and clyster poor Pug  As the fair one commanded he came at the word  And did the grand office in tiewig and sword  The affair being ended so sweet and so nice  He held out his hand with"You know ma'am my price"  "Your price" says the lady"Why Sir he's your brother  "And doctors must never take fees of each other"  APOLLO and DAPHNE An EPIGRAM  WHEN Phoebus was am'rous and long'd to be rude  Miss Daphne cry'd Pish and ran swift to the wood  And rather than do such a naughty affair  She became a fine laurel to deck the God's hair  The nymph was no doubt of a cold constitution  For sure to turn tree was an odd resolution  Yet in this she behav'd like a true modern spouse  For she fled from his arms to distinguish his brows  The BAGWIG and the TOBACCOPIPE A FABLE  A Bagwig of a jauntee air  Trick'd up with all a barber's care  Loaded with powder and perfume  Hung in a spendthrift's dressingroom  Close by its side by chance convey'd  A black Tobaccopipe was laid  And with its vapours far and near  Outstunk the essence of Monsieur  At which its rage the thing of hair  Thus bristling up began declare  "Bak'd dirt that with intrusion rude  "Breaks in upon my solitude  "And with thy fetid breath defiles  "The air for forty thousand miles  "Avauntpollution's in thy touch  "O barb'rous English horrid Dutch  "I cannot bear itHere Sue Nan  "Go call the maid to call the man  "And bid him come without delay  "To take this odious pipe away  "Hideous sure some one smoak'd thee Friend  "Reversely at his t'other end  "Oh what mix'd odours what a throng  "Of salt and sour of stale and strong  "A most unnatural combination  "Enough to mar all perspiration  "Monstrous again'twou'd vex a saint  "Susan the dropsor else I faint"  The pipe for 'twas a pipe of soul  Raising himself upon his bole  In smoke like oracle of old  Did thus his sentiments unfold  "Why what's the matter Goodman Swagger  "Thou flaunting French fantastic bragger  "Whose whole fine speech is with a pox  "Ridiculous and heterodox  "'Twas better for the English nation  "Before such scoundrels came in fashion  "When none sought hair in realms unknown  "But every blockhead bore his own  "Know puppy I'm an English pipe  "Deem'd worthy of each Briton's gripe  "Who with my cloudcompelling aid  "Help our plantations and our trade  "And am when sober and when mellow  "An upright downright honest fellow  "Tho' fools like you may think me rough  "And scorn me 'cause I am in buff  "Yet your contempt I glad receive  "'Tis all the fame that you can give  "None finery or fopp'ry prize  "But they who've something to disguise  "For simple nature hates abuse  "And Plainness is the dress of Use"  CARE and GENEROSITY A FABLE  OLD Care with Industry and Art  At length so well had play'd his Part  He heap'd up such an ample store  That Av'rice cou'd not sigh for more  Ten thousand flocks his shepherd told  His coffers overflow'd with Gold  The land all round him was his own  With corn his crouded granaries groan  In short so vast his charge and gain  That to possess them was a pain  With happiness oppress'd he lies  And much too prudent to be wise  Near him there liv'd a beauteous maid  With all the charms of youth array'd  Good amiable sincere and free  Her name was Generosity  'Twas hers the largess to bestow  On rich and poor on friend and foe  Her doors to all were open'd wide  The pilgrim there might safe abide  For th' hungry and the thirsty crew  The bread she broke the drink she drew  There Sickness laid her aching head  And there Distress cou'd find a bed  Each hour with an allbounteous hand  Diffused she blessings round the land  Her gifts and glory lasted long  And numerous was th' accepting throng  At length pale Penury seiz'd the dame  And Fortune fled and Ruin came  She found her riches at an end  And that she had not made one friend  All cursed her for not giving more  Nor thought on what she'd done before  She wept she rav'd she tore her hair  When lo to comfort her came Care  And cry'd my dear if you will join  Your hand in nuptial bonds with mine  All will be wellyou shall have store  And I be plagu'd with Wealth no more  Tho' I restrain your bounteous heart  You still shall act the generous part  The Bridal camegreat was the feast  And good the pudding and the priest  The bride in nine moons brought him forth  A little maid of matchless worth  Her face was mix'd of Care and Glee  They christen'd her Oeconomy  And styled her fair Discretion's Queen  The mistress of the golden mean  Now Generosity confin'd  Is perfect easy in her mind  She loves to give yet knows to spare  Nor wishes to be free from Care  AN OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE and EPILOGUE TO OTHELLO  As it was acted at the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane on Thursday the th of March by Persons of Distinction for their Diversion  WHILE mercenary actors tread the stage  And hireling scriblers lash or lull the age  Ours be the task t'instruct and entertain  Without one thought of glory or of gain  Virtue's her ownfrom no external cause  She gives and she demands the Selfapplause  Home to her breast she brings the heartfelt bays  Heedless alike of profit and of praise  This now perhaps is wrongyet this we know  'Twas sense and truth a century ago  When Britain with transcendent glory crown'd  For high atchievements as for wit renown'd  Cull'd from each growing grace the purest part  And cropt the flowers from every blooming art  Our noblest youth would then embrace the task  Of comic humour or the mystic masque  'Twas theirs t'incourage worth and give to bards  What now is spent in boxing and in cards  Good sense their pleasureVirtue still their guide  And English magnanimitytheir pride  Methinks I see with Fancy's magic eye  The shade of Shakespear in yon azure sky  On you high cloud behold the bard advance  Piercing all Nature with a single glance  In various attitudes around him stand  The passions waiting for his dread command  First kneeling Love before his feet appears  And musically sighing melts in tears  Near him fell Jealousy with fury burns  And into storms the amorous breathings turns  Then Hope with heavenward look and Joy draws near  While palsied Terror trembles in the rear  Such Shakespear's train of horror and delight  And such we hope to introduce tonight  But if tho' just in thought we fail in fact  And good intention ripens not to act  Weigh our design your censure still defer  When truth's in view 'tis glorious e'en to err  EPILOGUE Spoken by DESDEMONA  TRUE woman to the lastmy peroration  I come to speak in spight of suffocation  To shew the present and the age to come  We may be choak'd but never can be dumb  Well now methinks I see you all run out  And haste away to Lady Bragwell's rout  Each modish sentiment to hear and weigh  Of those who nothing think and all things say  Prudella first in parody begins  For Nonsense and Buffoonery are twins  "Can beaux the court for theatres exchange  "  I swear by Heaven 'tis strange    'tis passing strange    "And very whimsical and mighty dull  "  And pitiful    and wond'rous pitiful    "  I wish I had not heard it  Blessed dame  Whene'er she speaks her audience wish the same  Next Neddy Nicely"Fye O fye good lack  "A nasty man to make his face all black"  Then Lady Stiffneck shews her pious rage  And wonders we shou'd actupon a stage  "Why ma'me says Coquetilla a disgrace  "Merit in any form may shew her face  "In this dull age the male things ought to play  "To teach them what to do and what to say"  In short they all with different cavils cram us  And only are unanimous to damn us  But still there are a fair judicious few  Who judge unbiass'd and with candour view  Who value honesty tho' clad in buff  And wit tho' dress'd in an old English ruff  Behold them hereI beaming sense descry  Shot from the living lustre of each eye  Such meaning smiles each blooming face adorn  As deck the pleasurepainted brow of morn  And shew the person of each matchless fair  Tho' rich to rapture and above compare  Is even with all the skill of heaven design'd  But an imperfect image of their mind  While chastity unblemish'd and unbrib'd  Adds a majestic mien that scorns to be describ'd  Such we will vaunt and only such as these  'Tis our ambition and our fame to please  THE JUDGMENT OF MIDAS A MASQUE  Auriculas Asini Mida Rex habet  JUV

fav'ring Dian held her glitt'ring lamp  We ply'd our nightly toils nor ply'd we long  For Art was not the mistress of our revels  'Twas gentle Nature whom we jointly woo'd  She heard and yielded to the forms we taught her  Yet still remain'd herselfSimplicity  Fair Nature's genuine daughter was there too  So soft yet so magnificent of mien  She shone all ornament without a gem  The blithsome Flora ever sweet and young  Offer'd her various store We cull'd a few  To robe and recommend our darksome verdure  But shun'd to be luxuriant  TIMOLUS  It was well  Agno thy looks are pensive What

right or wrong  TIMOLUS  'Tis well remark'd and on experience founded  I do remember that my sister Ida  Whenas on her own shadowy mount we met  To celebrate the birthday of the Spring  And th' orgies

Rag'd like a feeble mortal fall'n she seem'd  Her deity in human passions lost  Ev'n Wisdom's goddess jealous of her form  Deem'd her own attribute her second virtue  Both vow'd and sought revenge  AGNO  If such the fate  Of him who judg'd aright what must be his  Who shall mistake the cause for much I doubt  The skill of Midas since his fatal wish  Which Bacchus heard and curs'd him with the gift  Yet grant him wise to err is human still  And mortal is the consequence  MELINOE  Most true  Besides I fear him partial for with Pan  He tends the sheepwalks all the livelong day  And on the braky lawn to the shrill pipe  In aukward gambols he affects to dance  Or tumbles to the tabor'tis not likely  That such an umpire shou'd be equitable  Unless he guess at justice  TIMOLUS  Softno more  'Tis ours to wish for Pan and fear from Phoebus  Whose near approach I hear Ye stately cedars  Forth from your summits bow your awful heads  And reverence the gods Let my whole mountain tremble  Not with a fearful but religious awe  And holiness of horror You ye winds  That make soft solemn music 'mongst the leaves  Be all to stillness hush'd and thou their echo  Listen and hold thy peace for see

boasted height  Where Pegasus thy fire and flight  Where all your thoughts so bold and free  Ye daughters of Mnemosyne  If Pan o'er Phoebus can prevail  And the great god of verse shou'd fail  AGNO  From nature's works and nature's laws  We find delight and seek applause  The prattling streams and zephyrs bland  And fragrant flow'rs by zephyrs fann'd  The level lawns and buxom bow'rs  Speak Nature and her works are ours  MELPOMENE  What were all your fragrant bow'rs  Splendid days and happy hours  Spring's verdant robe fair Flora's blush  And all the poets of the bush  What the paintings of the grove  Rural music mirth and love  Life and ev'ry joy wou'd pall  If Phoebus shone not on you all  MELINOE  We chant to Phoebus king of day  The morning and the evening lay  But Pan each satyre nymph and fawn  Adore as laureat of the lawn  From peevish March to joyous June  He keeps our restless souls in tune  Without his oaten reed and song  Phoebus thy days wou'd seem too long  APOLLO  Am I not he who prescious from on high  Sends a long look thro' all futurity  Am I not he to whom alone belong  The powers of Med'cine Melody and Song  Diffusely lib'ral as divinely bright  Eye of the universe and sire of light  PAN  O'er cots and vales and every shepherd swain  Inpeaceable preeminence I reign  With pipe on plain and nymph in secret grove  The day is music and the night is love  I blest with these nor envy nor desire  Thy gaudy chariot or thy golden lyre  CLIO  Soon as the dawn dispels the dark  Illustrious Phoebus 'gins t' appear  Proclaimed by the herald lark  And everwakeful chanticleer  The Persian pays his morning vow  And all the turban'd easterns bow  AGNO  Soon as the evening shades advance  And the gilt glowworn glitters fair  For rustic gambol gibe and dance  Fawns nymphs and dryads all prepare  Pan shall his swains from toil relieve  And rule the revels of the eve  MELPOMENE  In numbers as smooth as Callirhoe's stream  Glide the silverton'd verse when Apollo's the theme  While on his own mount Cyparissus is seen  And Daphne preserves her immutable green  We'll hail Hyperion with transport so long  Th' inventor the patron and subject of song  MELINOE  While on the calm ocean the Halcyon shall breed  And Syrinx shall sigh with her musical reed  While fairies and satyres and fawns shall approve  The music the mirth and the life of the grove  So long shall our Pan be than thee more divine  For he shall be rising when thou shalt decline  MIDAS  No moreTo Pan and to his beauteous nymphs  I do adjudge the prize as is most due  Enter two  Satyres  and crown  MIDAS  with a pair of ass's ears  APOLLO  Such rural honours all the gods decree  To those who sing like Pan and judge like thee    Exeunt Omnes  FINIS
