 THE QUERIST CONTAINING Several  QUERIES  Proposed to the CONSIDERATION OF THE PUBLIC  DUBLIN  Printed by R REILLY on CorkHill For G RISK G EWING and W SMITH Bookseller  in  DamesStreet  MDCCXXV  THE QUERIST c  Query I  WHETHER there ever was is or will be an industrious Nation poor or an idle rich    Qu  Whether a People can be called poor where the common Sort are well fed cloathed and lodged    Qu  Whether the Drift and Aim of every wise State should not be to encourage Industry in its Members and whether those who employ neither Heads nor Hands for the common Benefit deserve not to be expelled like Drones out of a well governed State    Qu  Whether the four Elements and Man's Labour therein be not the true Source of Wealth    Qu  Whether Money be not only so far useful as it stirreth up Industry enabling Men mutually to participate the Fruits of each others Labour    Qu  Whether any other Means equally conducing to excite and circulate the Industry of Mankind may not be as useful as Money    Qu  Whether the real End and Aim of Men be not Power And whether he who could have every Thing else at his Wish or Will would value Money    Qu  Whether the public Aim in every well govern'd State be not that each Member according to his just Pretensions and Industry should have Power    Qu  Whether Power be not referred to Action and whether Action doth not follow Appetite or Will    Qu  Whether Fashion doth not create Appetites and whether the prevailing Will of a Nation is not the Fashion    Qu  Whether the Current of Industry and Commerce be not determin'd by this prevailing Will    Qu  Whether it be not owing to Custom that most Fashions are agreeable    Qu  Whether it may not concern the Wisdom of the Legislature to interpose in the making of Fashions and not leave an Affair of so great influence to the management of Women and Fops and Taylors and Vintners    Qu  Whether reasonable Fashions are a greater restraint on Freedom than those which are unreasonable    Qu  Whether a general good Taste in a People would not greatly conduce to their thriving And whether an uneducated Gentry be not the greatest of national Evils    Qu  Whether Customs and Fashions do not supply the Place of Reason in the Vulgar of all Ranks Whether therefore it doth not very much import that they should be wisely framed    Qu  Whether the imitating those Neighbours in our Fashions to whom we bear no likeness in our Circumstances be not one cause of Distress to this Nation    Qu  Whether frugal Fashions in the upper Rank and comfortable living in the  lower be not the Means to multiply Inhabitants    Qu  Whether the bulk of our Irish Natives are not kept from thriving by that cynical Content in Dirt and Beggary which they possess to a Degree beyond any other People in Christendom    Qu  Whether the creating of Wants be not the likeliest way to produce Industry in a People And whether if our Peasants were accustomed to eat Beef and wear Shoes they would not be more Industrious    Qu  Whether other Things being given as Climate Soil c the Wealth be not proportioned to the Industry and this to the Circulation of Credit be the Credit circulated or transferred by what Marks or Tokens so ever    Qu  Whether therefore less Money swiftly circulating be not in effect equivalent to more Money slowly circulating Or whether if the Circulation be reciprocally as the Quantity of Coin the Nation can be a Loser    Qu  Whether Money is to be considered as having an intrinsic Value or as being a Commodity a Standard a Measure or a Pledge as is variously suggested by Writers  And whether the true Idea of Money as such be not altogether that of a Ticket or Counter    Qu  Whether the Value or Price of Things be not a compounded Proportion directly as the Demand and reciprocally as the Plenty    Qu  Whether the Terms  Crown    Livre    Pound Sterling  c are not to be considered as Exponents or Denominations of such Proportion and whether Gold Silver and Paper are not Tickets or Counters for Reckoning Recording and Transferring thereof    Qu  Whether the Denominations being retained although the Bullion were gone Things might not nevertheless be rated bought and sold Industry promoted and a Circulation of Commerce maintained    Qu  Whether an equal raising of all Sorts of Gold Silver and Copper Coin can have any effect in bringing Money into the Kingdom And whether altering the Proportions between the several Sorts can have any other effect but multiplying one Kind and lessening another without any increase of the Sum total    Qu  Whether arbitrary changing the Denomination of Coin be not a public Cheat    Qu  Whether nevertheless the Damage would be very considerable if by Degrees our Money were brought back to the English Value there to rest for ever    Qu  Whether the English Crown did not formerly pass with us for six Shillings And what Inconvenience ensued to the Public upon its Reduction to the present Value and whether what hath been may not be    Qu  What makes a wealthy People And whether Mines of Gold and Silver are capable of doing this Whether Negroes amidst the Gold Sands of Afric are not poor and destitute    Qu  Whether there be any Vertue in Gold or Silver other than as they set People at Work or create Industry    Qu  Whether it be not the Opinion or Will of the People exciting them to Industry that truly enricheth a Nation And whether this doth not principally depend on the Means for counting transferring and preserving Power that is property of all Kinds    Qu  Whether if there was no Silver in the Kingdom our Trade might not nevertheless supply Bills of Exchange sufficient to answer the Demands of Absentees in England or elsewhere    Qu  Whether current Bank Notes may not be deemed Money And whether they are not actually the greater part of the Money of this Kingdom    Qu  Provided the Wheels move whether it is not the same Thing as to the effect of the Machine be this done by the Force of Wind or Water or Animals    Qu  Whether Power to command the Industry of others be not real Wealth And whether Money be not in Truth Tickets or Tokens for conveying and recording such Power and whether it be of great Consequence what Materials the Tickets are made of    Qu  Whether Trade either foreign or domestick be in Truth any more than this Commerce of Industry    Qu  Whether to promote transfer and secure this Commerce and this Property in human Labour or in other Words this Power be not the sole Means of enriching a  People and how far this may be done independently of Gold and Silver    Qu  Whether it were not wrong to suppose Land it self to be Wealth And whether the Industry of the People is not first to be consider'd as that which constitutes Wealth which makes even Land and Silver to be Wealth neither of which would have any Value but as Means and Motives to Industry    Qu  Whether in the Wastes of America a Man might not possess twenty Miles square of Land and yet want his Dinner or a Coat to his Back    Qu  Whether a fertile Land and the Industry of its Inhabitants would not prove inexhaustable Funds of real Wealth be the Counters for conveying and recording thereof what you will Paper Gold or Silver    Qu  Whether a single Hint be sufficient to overcome a Prejudice And whether even obvious Truths will not sometimes bear repeating    Qu  Whether if human Labour be the true source of Wealth it doth not follow that Idleness should of all things be discourag'd in a wise State    Qu  Whether even Gold or Silver if they should lessen the Industry of its Inhabitants would not be ruinous to a Country And whether Spain be not an Instance of this    Qu  Whether the Opinion of Men and their Industry consequent thereupon be not the true Wealth of Holland and not the Silver supposed to be deposited in the Bank at Amsterdam    Qu  Whether there is in Truth any such Treasure lying dead And whether it be of great consequence to the Public that it should be real rather than notional    Qu  Whether in order to understand the true Nature of Wealth and Commerce it would not be right to consider a Ship's Crew cast upon a desert Island and by Degrees forming themselves to Business and civil Life while Industry begot Credit and Credit moved to Industry    Qu  Whether such Men would not all set themselves to Work Whether they would not subsist by the mutual Participation of each others Industry Whether when one Man had in his Way procured more than he could consume he would not exchange his Superfluities to supply his Wants Whether this must not produce Credit Whether  to facilitate these Conveyances to record and circulate this Credit they would not soon agree on certain Tallies Tokens Tickets or Counters    Qu  Whether Reflection in the better Sort might not soon remedy our Evils And whether our real Defect be not a wrong Way of Thinking    Qu  Whether it would not be an unhappy Turn in our Gentlemen if they should take more Thought to create an Interest to themselves in this or that County or Borough than to promote the real Interest of their Country    Qu  Whether it be not a Bull to call that making an Interest whereby a Man spendeth much and gaineth nothing    Qu  Whether if a Man builds a House he doth not in the first Place provide a Plan which governs his Work and shall the Public act without an End a View a Plan    Qu  Whether by how much the less particular Folk think for themselves the Public be not so much the more obliged to think for them    Qu  Whether Cunning be not one thing and good Sense another And whether  a cunning Tradesman doth not stand in his own Light    Qu  Whether small Gains be not the way to great Profit And if our Tradesmen are Beggars whether they may not thank themselves for it    Qu  Whether some way might not be found for making Criminals useful in Public Works instead of sending them either to America or to the other World    Qu  Whether we may not as well as other Nations contrive Employment for them And whether Servitude Chains and hard Labour for a term of Years would not be a more discouraging as well as a more adequate Punishment for Felons than even Death itself    Qu  Whether there are not such Things in Holland as bettering Houses for bringing young Gentlemen to Order And whether such an Institution might be useless among us    Qu  Whether it be true that the Poor in Holland have no Resource but their own Labour and yet there are no Beggars in their Streets    Qu  Whether he whose Luxury consumeth foreign Products and whose Industry produceth nothing domestic to Exchange for them is not so far forth injurious to his Country    Qu  Whether consequently the fine Gentlemen whose Employment is only to dress drink and play be not a public Nuisance    Qu  Whether Necessity is not to be hearkened to before Convenience and Convenience before Luxury    Qu  Whether to provide plentifully for the Poor be not feeding the Root the Substance whereof will shoot upwards into the Branches and cause the Top to flourish    Qu  Whether there be any Instance of a State wherein the People living neatly and plentifully did not aspire to Wealth    Qu  Whether Nastiness and Beggary do not on the contrary extinguish all such Ambition making Men listless helpless and slothful    Qu  Whether a Country inhabited by People well fed cloathed and lodged would not become every Day more populous And  whether a numerous Stock of People in such Circumstances would not constitute a flourishing Nation and how far the Product of our own Country may suffice for the compassing of this End    Qu  Whether a People who had provided themselves with the Necessaries of Life in good Plenty would not soon extend their Industry to new Arts and new Branches of Commerce    Qu  Whether those same Manufactures which England imports from other Countries may not be admitted from Ireland And if so whether Lace Carpets and Tapestry three considerable Articles of English Importation might not find Encouragment in Ireland And whether an Academy for Design might not greatly conduce to the perfecting those Manufactures among us    Qu  Whether France and Flanders could have drawn so much Money from England for figured Silks Lace and Tapestry if they had not had Academies for Designing    Qu  Whether when a Room was once prepared and Models in Plaister of Paris the Annual Expence of such an Academy need stand the Public in above two hundred Pounds a Year    Qu  Whether our Linen Manufacture would not find the Benefit of this Institution And whether there be any Thing that makes us fall short of the Dutch in Damasks Diapers and printed Linen but our Ignorance in Design    Qu  Whether those Specimens of our own Manufacture hung up in a certain public Place do not sufficiently declare such our Ignorance And whether for the Honour of the Nation they ought not to be removed    Qu  Whether those who may slight this Affair as notional have sufficiently considered the extensive use of the Art of Design and its Influence in most Trades and Manufactures wherein the Forms of Things are often more regarded than the Materials    Qu  Whether there be any Art sooner learned than that of making Carpets And whether our Women with little Time and Pains may not make more beautiful Carpets than those imported from Turky And whether this Branch of the Woollen Manufacture be not open to us  See Qu      Qu  Whether human Industry can produce from such cheap Materials a Manufacture of so great Value by any other Art than by those of Sculpture and Painting    Qu  Whether Pictures and Statues are not in Fact so much Treasure And whether Rome and Florence would not be poor Towns without them    Qu  Whether they do not bring ready Money as well as Jewels Whether in Italy Debts are not paid and Children portioned with them as with Gold and Silver    Qu  Whether it would not be more prudent to strike out and exert ourselves in permitted Branches of Trade than to fold our Hands and repine that we are not allowed the Woollen    Qu  Whether it be true that two Millions are yearly expended by England in foreign Lace and Linnen    Qu  Whether immense Sums are not drawn yearly into the northern Countries for supplying the British Navy with Hempen Manufactures    Qu  Whether there be any Thing more profitable than Hemp And whether there should not be great Premiums for encouraging our Hempen Trade what Advantages may not Great Britain make of a Country where Land and Labour are so cheap    Qu  Whether Ireland alone might not raise Hemp sufficient for the British Navy And whether it would not be vain to expect this from the British Colonies in America where Hands are so scarce and Labour so excessively dear    Qu  Whether if our own People want Will or Capacity for such an Attempt it might not be worth while for some undertaking Spirits in England to make Settlements and raise Hemp in the Counties of Clare and Limeric than which perhaps there is not fitter Land in the World for that Purpose And whether both Nations would not find their Advantage therein    Qu  Whether if all the idle Hands in this Kingdom were employed on Hemp and Linen we might not find sufficient Vent for these Manufactures    Qu  How far it may be in our own Power to better our Affairs without interfering with our Neighbours    Qu  Whether the Prohibition of our Woollen Trade ought not naturally to put us on other Methods which give no Jealousy    Qu  Whether Paper be not a valuable Article of Commerce And whether it be not  true that one single Bookseller in London yearly expends above four thousand Pounds in that foreign Commodity    Qu  How it comes to pass that the Venetians and Genoese who wear so much less Linen and so much worse than we do should yet make very good Paper and in great quantity while we make very little and very bad    Qu  How long it will be before my Countrymen find out that it is worth while to spend a penny in order to get a groat    Qu  If all the Land were tilled that is fit for Tillage and all that sowed with Hemp and Flax that is fit for raising them whether we should have much SheepWalk beyond what was sufficient to supply the Necessities of the Kingdom    Qu  Whether other Countries have not flourished without the Woollen Trade    Qu  Whether it be not a sure Sign or Effect of a Countries thriving to see it well cultivated and full of Inhabitants And if so whether a great Quantity of SheepWalk be not ruinous to a Country rendering it Waste and thinly Inhabited    Qu  Whether the Employing so much of our Land under Sheep be not in fact an Irish Bull    Qu  Whether our hankering after the Woollen Trade be not the true and only Reason which hath created a Jealousy in England towards Ireland And whether any Thing can hurt us more than such a Jealousy    Qu  Whether it be not the true Interest of both Nations to become one People And whether either be sufficiently apprized of this    Qu  Whether the upper Part of this People are not truly English by Blood Language Religion Manners Inclination and Interest    Qu  Whether we are not as much Englishmen as the Children of old Romans born in Britain were still Romans    Qu  Whether it be not our true Interest not to interfere with them and in every other Case whether it be not their true Interest to befriend us    Qu  Whether a Mint in Ireland might not be of great Convenience to the Kingdom and whether it could be attended with any possible Inconvenience to great Britain And  whether there were not Mints in Naples and in Sicily when those Kingdoms were Provinces to Spain or the House of Austria    Qu  Whether any Thing can be more ridiculous than for the North of Ireland to be Jealous of a Linen Manufacture in the South    Qu  Whether the County of Tiperary be not much better Land than the County of Armagh and yet whether the latter is not much better improved and inhabited than the former    Qu  Whether every Landlord in the Kingdom doth not know the Cause of this And yet how few are the better for such their Knowledge    Qu  Whether large Farms under few Hands or small ones under many are likely to be made most of And whether Flax and Tillage do not naturally multiply Hands and divide Land into small Holdings and well improved    Qu  Whether as our Exports are lessened we ought not to lessen our Imports And whether these will not be lessened as our Demands and these as our Wants and these as our Customs or Fashions Of how  great Consequence therefore are Fashions to the Public  See Qu      Qu  Whether it would not be more reasonable to mend our State than to complain of it and how far this may be in our own Power    Qu  What the Nation gains by those who live in Ireland upon the Produce of foreign Countries    Qu  How far the Vanity of our Ladies in dressing and of our Gentlemen in drinking contributes to the general Misery of the People    Qu  Whether Nations as wise and opulent as ours have not made sumptuary Laws and what hinders us from doing the same    Qu  Whether those who drink foreign Liquors and deck Themselves and their Families with foreign Ornaments are not so far forth to be reckon'd Absentees    Qu  Whether as our Trade is limited we ought not to limit our Expences and whether this be not the natural and obvious Remedy    Qu  Whether the Dirt and Famine and Nakedness of the Bulk of our People might not be remedied even although we had no foreign Trade And whether this should not be our first Care and whether if this were once provided for the Conveniencies of the Rich would not soon follow    Qu  Whether comfortable living doth not produce Wants and Wants Industry and Industry Wealth  See Qu      Qu  Whether there is not a great difference between Holland and Ireland And whether foreign Commerce without which the one could not subsist be so necessary for the other    Qu  Might we not put a Hand to the Plough or the Spade though we had no foreign Commerce    Qu  Whether the Exigencies of Nature are not to be answered by Industry on our own Soil And how far the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life may be procured by a domestic Commerce between the several Parts of this Kingdom    Qu  Whether the Women may not sew spin weave embroider sufficiently for the embelishment of their Persons and even  enough to raise Envy in each other without being beholden to foreign Countries    Qu  Suppose the Bulk of our Inhabitants had Shoes to their Feet Cloaths to their Backs and Beef in their Bellies Might not such a State be eligible for the Public even though the Squires were condemned to drink Ale and Cyder    Qu  Whether if Drunkenness be a necessary Evil Men may not as well get Drunk with the growth of their own Country    Qu  Whether a Nation within itself might not have real Wealth sufficient to give its Inhabitants Power and Distinction without the help of Gold and Silver    Qu  Whether if the Arts of Sculpture and Painting were encouraged among us we might not furnish our Houses in a much nobler Manner with our own Manufacture  See Qu      Qu  Whether we have not or may not have all the necessary Materials for Building at Home    Qu  Whether Tiles and Plaister may not supply the Place of Norway Fir for flooring and Wainscot    Qu  Whether Plaister be not warmer as well as more secure than Deal And whether a modern fashionable House lined with Fir daubed over with Oyl and Paint be not like a Fireship ready to be lighted up by all Accidents    Qu  Whether larger Houses better built and Furnished a greater Train of Servants the difference with regard to Equipage and Table between finer and coarser more and less Elegant and Impolite may not be sufficient to feed a reasonable Share of Vanity or support all proper Distinctions And whether all these may not be procured by domestic Industry out of the four Elements without ransacking the four Quarters of the Globe    Qu  Whether any Thing is a nobler Ornament in the Eye of the World than an Italian Palace that is Stone and Mortar skilfully put together and adorned with Sculpture and Painting and whether this may not be compassed without foreign Trade    Qu  Whether an Expence in Gardens and Plantations would not be an elegant Distinction for the Rich a domestic Magnificence employing many Hands within and drawing nothing from abroad    Qu  Whether the Apology which is made for foreign Luxury in England to wit that they could not carry on their Trade without Imports as well as Exports will hold in Ireland    Qu  Whether one may not be allowed to conceive and suppose a Society or Nation of Human Creatures clad in Woollen Cloaths and Stuffs eating good Bread Beef and Mutton Poultry and Fish in great Plenty drinking Ale Mead and Cyder inhabiting decent Houses built of Brick and Marble taking their Pleasure in fair Parks and Gardens depending on no foreign Imports either for Food or Raiment and whether such People ought much to be pitied    Qu  Whether Ireland be not as well qualified for such a State as any Nation under the Sun    Qu  Whether in such a State the Inhabitants may not contrive to pass the twenty four Hours with tolerable Ease and Chearfulness And whether any People upon Earth can do more    Qu  Whether they might not eat drink play dress visit sleep in good Beds sit by good Fires build plant raise a Name make Estates and spend them    Qu  Whether upon the whole a domestic Trade may not suffice in such a Country as Ireland to nourish and cloath its Inhabitants and provide them with the reasonable Conveniencies and even Comforts of Life    Qu  Whether a general Habit of living well would not produce Numbers and Industry and whether considering the Tendency of human Kind the Consequence thereof would not be foreign Trade and Riches how unnecessary soever  See Qu      Qu  Whether nevertheless it be a Crime to enquire how far we may do without foreign Trade and what would follow on such a Supposition    Qu  Whether the Number and Welfare of the Subjects be not the true Strength of the Crown    Qu  Whether in all public Institutions there should not be an End proposed which is to be the Rule and Limit of the Means Whether this End should not be the Wellbeing of the Whole And whether in order to this the first Step should not be to cloath and feed our People    Qu  Whether there be upon Earth any Christian or civilized People so beggarly  wretched and destitute as the common Irish    Qu  Whether nevertheless there is any other People whose Wants may be more easily supplyed from Home    Qu  Whether if there was a Wall of Brass a thousand Cubits high round this Kingdom our Natives might not nevertheless live cleanly and comfortably till the Land and reap the Fruits of it    Qu  What should hinder us from exerting ourselves using our Hands and Brains doing something or other Man Woman and Child like the other Inhabitants of God's Earth    Qu  Be the restraining our Trade well or ill advised in our Neighbours with respect to their own Interest yet whether it be not plainly ours to accomodate ourselves to it    Qu  Whether it be not vain to think of persuading other People to see their Interest while we continue blind to our own    Qu  Whether there be any other Nation possess'd of so much good Land and so  many able Hands to Work it which yet is beholden for Bread to foreign Countries    Qu  Whether it be true that we import Corn to the yearly value of two hundred thousand Pounds    Qu  Whether we are not undone by Fashions made for other People And whether it be not Madness in a poor Nation to imitate a rich one    Qu  Whether a Woman of Fashion ought not to be declar'd a public Enemy    Qu  Whether it be not certain that from the single Town of Cork were exported last Year no less than one hundred and seven thousand one hundred sixty one Barrels of Beef seven thousand three hundred and seventy nine Barrels of Pork thirteen thousand four hundred and sixty one Casks and eighty five thousand seven hundred and twenty seven Firkins of Butter And what Hands were employed in this Manufacture    Qu  Whether a Foreigner could imagine that one half of the People were starving in a Country which sent out such Plenty of Provisions    Qu  Whether an Irish Lady set out  with French Silks and Flanders Lace may not be said to consume more Beef and Butter than fifty of our labouring Peasants    Qu  Whether nine Tenths of our foreign Trade be not singly to support the Article of Vanity    Qu  Whether it can be hoped private Persons will not indulge this Folly unless restrained by the Public    Qu  How Vanity is maintained in other Countries whether in Hungary for Instance a proud Nobility are not subsisted with small Imports from abroad    Qu  Whether there be a prouder People upon Earth than the noble Venetians though they all wear plain black

public Sacrifice the Squire his Bottle the Lady her Lace    Qu  Whether Claret be not often drunk rather for Vanity than for Health or Pleasure    Qu  Whether it be true that Men of nice Palates have been imposed on by Elder Wine for French Claret and by Mead for Palm Sack    Qu  Do not Englishmen abroad purchase Beer and Cyder at ten Times the price of Wine    Qu  How many Gentlemen are there in England of a thousand Pounds per Annum who never drink Wine in their own Houses Whether the same may be said of any in Ireland who have even one hundred Pounds per Annum    Qu  What reason have our Neighbours in England for discouraging French Wines which may not hold with Respect to us also    Qu  How much of the necessary Sustenance of our People is yearly exported for Brandy    Qu  Whether if People must poison themselves they had not better do it with their own Growth    Qu  If we imported neither Claret from France nor Fir from Norway what the Nation would save by it    Qu  When the Root yieldeth insufficient Nourishment whether Men do not Top the Tree to make the lower Branches thrive    Qu  Whether if our Ladies drank Sage or Balm Tea out of Irish Ware it would be an insupportable national Calamity    Qu  Whether it be really true that such Wine is best as most encourages drinking i e that must be given in the largest Dose to produce its effect And whether this holds with regard to any Medicine    Qu  Whether that Trade should not be accounted most pernicious wherein the Balance is most against us And whether this be not the Trade with France    Qu  Whether it be not even Madness to encourage Trade with a Nation that takes nothing of our Manufacture    Qu  Whether Ireland can hope to thrive if the major Part of her Patriots shall be found in the French Interest  See Qu      Qu  Why if a Bribe by the Palate or the Purse be in effect the same Thing they should not be alike infamous    Qu  Whether the Vanity and Luxury of a few ought to stand in Competition with the Interest of a Nation    Qu  Whether national Wants ought not to be the Rule of Trade And whether the most pressing Wants of the Majority ought not to be first consider'd    Qu  Whether it is possible the Country should be well improved while our Beef is exported and our Labourers live upon Potatoes  See Qu      Qu  If it be resolved that we cannot do without foreign Trade whether at least it may not be worth while to consider what Branches thereof deserve to be entertained and how far we may be able to carry it on under our present Limitations    Qu  What foreign Imports may be necessary for clothing and feeding the Families of Persons not worth above one hundred Pounds a Year And how many wealthier there are in the Kingdom and what Proportion they bear to the other Inhabitants    Qu  Whether Trade be not then on a right Foot when foreign Commodities are imported in Exchange only for domestic Superfluities    Qu  Whether the Quantities of Beef Butter Wool and Leather exported from this Island can be reckon'd the Superfluities of a Country where there are so many Natives naked and famished    Qu  Whether it would not be wise so to order our Trade as to export Manufactures rather than Provisions and of those such as employ most Hands    Qu  Whether she would not be a very vile Matron and justly thought either mad or foolish that should give away the Necessaries of Life from her naked and famished Children in Exchange for Pearls to stick in her Hair and sweet Meats to please her own Palate    Qu  Whether a Nation might not be consider'd as a Family    Qu  Whether other Methods may not be found for supplying the Funds besides the Custom on Things imported    Qu  Whether any Art or Manufacture be so difficult as the making of good Laws

it doth not imply some Fund of Knowledge historical moral and political with a Faculty of Reason improved by Learning    Qu  Whether every Enemy to Learning be not a Goth And whether every such Goth among us be not an Enemy to the Country    Qu  Whether therefore it would not be an Omen of ill presage a dreadful Phoenomenon in the Land if our great Men should take it in their Heads to deride Learning and Education    Qu  Whether on the contrary it should not seem worth while to erect a Mart of Literature in this Kingdom under wiser Regulations and better Discipline than in any other Part of Europe And whether this would not be an infallible Means of drawing Men and Money into the Kingdom    Qu  Whether the governed be not too numerous for the governing Part of our College And whether it might not be expedient to convert thirty Natives Places into twenty Fellowships    Qu  Whether if we had two Colleges there might not spring an useful Emulation between them And whether it might not be contrived so to divide the Fellows Scholars and Revenues between both as that no Member should be a Loser thereby    Qu  Whether ten thousand Pounds well laid out might not build a decent College fit to contain two hundred Persons and whether the purchaseMoney of the Chambers would not go a good way towards defraying the Expence    Qu  Where this College should be situated    Qu  Whether it is possible a State should not thrive whereof the lower Part were industrious and the upper wise    Qu  Whether the collected Wisdom of Ages and Nations be not found in Books improved and applied by Study    Qu  Whether it was not an Irish Professor who first open'd the public Schools at Oxford Whether this Island hath not been antiently famous for Learning and whether at this Day it hath any better Chance for being considerable    Qu  Whether we may not with better Grace sit down and complain when we have done all that lies in our Power to help ourselves    Qu  Whether the Gentleman of Estate hath a right to be idle and whether he ought not to be the great Promoter and Director of Industry among his Tenants and Neighbours    Qu  Whether the real Foundation for Wealth must not be laid in the Numbers the Frugality and the Industry of the People And whether all Attempts to enrich a Nation by other Means as raising the Coin Stockjobbing and such Arts are not vain    Qu  Whether a Door ought not to be shut against all other Methods of growing rich save only by Industry and Merit and whether Wealth got otherwise would not be ruinous to the Public    Qu  Whether the abuse of Banks and PaperMoney is a just Objection against the use thereof And whether such abuse might not easily be prevented    Qu  Whether national Banks are not found useful in Venice Holland and Hambourgh And whether it is not possible to  contrive one that may be useful also in Ireland    Qu  Whether any Nation ever was in greater want of such an Expedient than Ireland    Qu  Whether the Banks of Venice and Amsterdam are not in the Hands of the Public    Qu  Whether it may not be worth while to inform ourselves in the Nature of those Banks And what Reason can be assigned why Ireland should not reap the Benefit of such public Banks as well as other Countries    Qu  Whether a Bank of national Credit supported by public Funds and secured by Parliament be a Chimera or impossible Thing and if not what would follow from the Supposal of such Bank    Qu  Whether the Currency of a Credit so well secured would not be of great Advantage to our Trade and Manufactures    Qu  Whether the Notes of such pub  would not have a more general Cir  than those of private Banks as being  subject to Frauds and Hazards    Qu  Whether it be not agreed that Paper hath in many respects the Advantage above Coin as being of more Dispatch in Payments more easily transferred preserved and recovered when lost    Qu  Whether beside these Advantages there be not an evident Necessity for circulating Credit by Paper from the Defect of Coin in this Kingdom    Qu  Whether the Public may not as well save the Interest which it now pays    Qu  What would happen if two of our Banks should break at once And whether it be wise to neglect providing against an Event which Experience hath shewn us not to be impossible    Qu  Whether such an Accident would not particularly affect the Bankers And therefore whether a national Bank would not be a Security even to private Bankers    Qu  Whether we may not easily avoid the Inconveniencies attending the PaperMoney of New England which were incurred by their issuing too great a Quantity of Notes by their having no Silver in Bank to exchange for Notes by their not insisting upon Repayment of the Loans at the Time  prefixed and especially by their Want of Manufactures to answer their Imports from Europe    Qu  Whether a Combination of Bankers might not do Wonders and whether Bankers know their own Strength    Qu  Whether a Bank in private Hands might not even overturn a Government And whether this was not the Case of the Bank of St George in Genoa  See the Vindication and Advancement of our national Constitution and Credit Printed in London    Qu  Whether we may not easily prevent the ill Effects of such a Bank as Mr Law proposed for Scotland which was faulty in not limiting the Quantum of Bills and permitting all Persons to take out what Bills they pleased upon the Mortgage of Lands whence by a Glut of Paper the Prices of Things must rise Whence also the Fortunes of Men must encrease in Denomination though not in Value whence Pride Idleness and Beggary    Qu  Whether such Banks as those of England and Scotland might not be attended with great Inconveniences as lodging too much Power in the Hands of private Men  and giving handle for Monopolies Stockjobbing and destructive Schemes    Qu  Whether the national Bank projected by an Anonymous Writer in the latter End of Queen Anne's Reign might not on the other Hand be attended with as great Inconveniencies by lodging too much Power in the Government    Qu  Whether the Bank projected by  Murray  though it partake in many useful Particulars with that of Amsterdam yet as it placeth too great Power in the Hands of a private Society might not be dangerous to the Public    Qu  Whether it be rightly remarked by some that as Banking brings no Treasure into the Kingdom like Trade private Wealth must sink as the Bank riseth And whether whatever causeth Industry to flourish and circulate may not be said to increase our Treasure    Qu  Whether the ruinous Effects of Mississippi SouthSea and such Schemes were not owing to an abuse of Paper Money or Credit in making it a Means for Idleness and Gaming instead of a Motive and Help to Industry    Qu  Whether those Effects could have happened had there been no Stockjobbing And whether Stockjobbing could at first have been set on Foot without an imaginary Foundation of some Improvement to the Stock by Trade Whether therefore when there are no such Projects or Cheats or private Schemes proposed the same Effects can be justly feared    Qu  Whether by a  national Bank  be not properly understood a Bank not only establish'd by public Authority as the Bank of England but a Bank in the Hands of the Public wherein there are no Shares Whereof the Public alone is Proprietor and reaps all the Benefit    Qu  Whether having considered the Conveniencies of Banking and PaperCredit in some Countries and the Inconveniencies thereof in others we may not contrive to adopt the former and avoid the latter    Qu  Whether great Evils to which other Schemes are liable may not be prevented by excluding the Managers of the Bank from a share in the Legislature    Qu  Whether the rise of the Bank of Amsterdam was not purely casual for the Security and Dispatch of Payments And whether  the good Effects thereof in supplying the Place of Coin and promoting a ready Circulation of Industry and Commerce may not be a Lesson to us to do that by Design which others fell upon by chance    Qu  Whether the Bank proposed to be established in Ireland under the Notion of a national Bank by the voluntary Subscription of three hundred thousand Pounds to pay off the national Debt the Interest of which Sum to be paid the Subscribers subject to certain Terms of Redemption be not in reality a private Bank as those of England and Scotland which are national only in Name being in the Hands of particular Persons and making Dividends on the Money paid in by Subscribers  See a Proposal for the Relief of Ireland  c  Printed in Dublin A D    Qu  Whether Plenty of small Cash be not absolutely necessary for keeping up a Circulation among the People that is whether Copper be not more necessary than Gold    Qu  Whether it is not worth while to reflect on the Expedients made use of by other Nations PaperMoney BankNotes public Funds and Credit in all its Shapes to examine what hath been done and devised  to add our own Animadversions and upon the whole offer such Hints as seem not unworthy the Attention of the Public    Qu  Whether that which increaseth the Stock of a Nation be not a Means of increasing its Trade And whether that which increaseth the current Credit of a Nation may not be said to increase its Stock    Qu  Whether it may not be expedient to appoint certain Funds or Stock for a national Bank under direction of certain Persons one third whereof to be named by the Government and one third by each House of Parliament    Qu  Whether the Directors should not be excluded from sitting in either House and whether they should not be subject to the Audit and Visitation of a standing Committee of both Houses    Qu  Whether such Committee of Inspectors should not be changed every two Years one half going out and another coming in by Ballot    Qu  Whether the Notes ought not to be issued in Lots to be lent at Interest on mortgaged Lands the whole Number of Lots  to be divided among the four Provinces rateably to the Number of Hearths in each    Qu  Whether it may not be expedient to appoint four counting Houses one in each Province for converting Notes into Specie    Qu  Whether a Limit should not be fixed which no Person might exceed in taking out Notes    Qu  Whether the better to answer domestic Circulation it may not be right to issue Notes as low as twenty Shillings    Qu  Whether all the Bills should be issued at once or rather by Degrees that so Men may be gradually accustomed and reconciled to the Bank    Qu  Whether the keeping of the Cash and the direction of the Bank ought not to be in different Hands and both under Public Controle    Qu  Whether the same Rule should not alway be observed of lending out Money or Notes only to half the Value of the Mortgaged Land And whether this Value should not alway be rated at the same Number of Years Purchase as at first    Qu  Whether Care should not be taken to prevent an undue Rise of the Value of Land    Qu  Whether the increase of Industry and People will not of Course raise the Value of Land And whether this Rise may not be sufficient    Qu  Whether Land may not be apt to rise on the issuing too great Plenty of Notes    Qu  Whether this may not be prevented by the gradual and slow issuing of Notes and by frequent Sales of Lands    Qu  Whether Interest doth not measure the true Value of Land for Instance where Money is at five per Cent whether Land is not worth twenty Years Purchase    Qu  Whether two small a Proportion of Money would not hurt the landed Man and too great a Proportion the monied Man And whether the Quantum of Notes ought not to bear Proportion to the public Demand And whether Trial must not shew what this Demand will be    Qu  Whether the exceeding this Measure might not produce divers bad Effects one whereof would be the Loss of our Silver    Qu  Whether Interest paid into the Bank ought not to go on augmenting its Stock    Qu  Whether it would or would not be right to appoint that the said Interest be paid in Notes only  See Mr John Laws on Money and Trade    Qu  Whether the Notes of this national Bank should not be received in all Payments into the Exchequer    Qu  Whether on Supposition that the Specie should fail the Credit would not nevertheless still pass being admitted in all Payments of the public Revenue    Qu  Whether the Public can become Bankrupt so long as the Notes are issued on good Security    Qu  Whether Mismanagement prodigal Living Hazards by Trade which often affect private Banks are equally to be apprehended in a Public one    Qu  Whether as Credit became Current and this raised the Value of Land the Security must not of Course rise  See Qu      Qu  Whether as our current domestic Credit grew Industry would not grow likewise and if Industry our Manufactures and if these our foreign Credit    Qu  Whether by Degrees as Business and People multiplied more Bills may not be issued without augmenting the Capital Stock provided still that they are issued on good Security which further issuing of new Bills not to be without Consent of Parliament    Qu  Whether such Bank would not be Secure Whether the Profits accruing to the Public would not be very considerable And whether Industry in private Persons would not be supplied and a general Circulation encouraged    Qu  Whether such Bank should or should not be allowed to issue Notes for Money deposited therein And if not whether the Bankers would have Cause to complain    Qu  Whether if the Public thrives all particular Persons must not feel the Benefit thereof even the Bankers themselves    Qu  Whether beside the BankCompany there are not in England many private wealthy Bankers and whether they were more before the erecting of that Company    Qu  Whether as Industry increased our Manufactures would not flourish and as these flourished whether better Returns would not be made from Estates to their Landlords both within and without the Kingdom    Qu  Whether we have not PaperMoney circulating among us already Whether therefore we might not as well have that which is secured by the Public and whereof the Public reaps the Benefit    Qu  Whether there are not two general Ways of circulating Money to wit Play and Traffic And whether Stockjobbing is not to be ranked under the former    Qu  Whether there are more than two Things that might draw Silver out of the Bank when its Credit was once well established to wit foreign Demands and small Payments at Home    Qu  Whether if our Trade with France were checked the former of these Causes could be supposed to Operate at all And whether the latter could operate to any great Degree  See Qu      Qu  Whether the sure Way to supply People with Tools and Materials and to  set them at Work be not a free Circulation of Money whether Silver or Paper    Qu  Whether in New England all Trade and Business is not as much at a Stand upon a Scarcity of PaperMoney as with us from the Want of Specie    Qu  Whether PaperMoney or Notes may not be issued from the national Bank on the security of Hemp of Linen or other Manufactures whereby the Poor might be supported in their Industry    Qu  Whether it be certain that the Quantity of Silver in the Bank of Amsterdam be greater now than at first but whether it be not certain that there is a greater Circulation of Industry and Extent of Trade more People Ships Houses and Commodities of all Sorts more Power by Sea and Land    Qu  Whether Money lying Dead in the Bank of Amsterdam would not be as useless as in the Mine    Qu  Whether our visible Security in Land could be doubted And whether there be any Thing like this in the Bank of Amsterdam    Qu  Whether it be just to apprehend Danger from trusting a national Bank with Power to extend its Credit to circulate Notes which it shall be Felony to counterfeit to receive  Goods on Loans to purchase Lands to fell also or alienate them and to deal in Bills of Exchange when these Powers are no other than have been trusted for many Years with the Bank of England although in Truth but a private Bank  See Qu      Qu  Whether the Objection from Monopolies and an overgrowth of Power which are made against private Banks can possibly hold against a national one    Qu  Whether Banks raised by private Subscription would be as advantageous to the Public as to the Subscribers And whether Risques and Frauds might not be more justly apprehended from them    Qu  Whether the evil Effects which of late Years have attended PaperMoney and Credit in Europe did not spring from Subscriptions Shares Dividends Stockjobbing    Qu  Whether great Evils attending PaperMoney in the British Plantations of America have not sprung from the overrating their Lands and issuing Paper without Discretion and from the Legislators breaking their own Rules in Favour of themselves thus sacrificing the Public to their private Benefit And whether a little Sense and Honesty might not easily prevent all such Inconveniencies  See Qu      Qu  Whether an Argument from the Abuse of Things against the use of them be Conclusive    Qu  Whether he who is bred to a Part be fittest to judge of the Whole    Qu  Whether Interest be not apt to bias Judgment And whether Traders only are to be consulted about Trade or Bankers about Money    Qu  Whether the Subject of Freethinking in Religion be not exhausted And whether it be not high Time for our Freethinkers to turn their Thoughts to the Improvement of their Country    Qu  Whether any Man hath a Right to judge that will not be at the Pains to distinguish    Qu  Whether there be not a wide Difference between the Profits going to augment the national Stock and being divided among private Sharers And whether in the former Case there can possibly be any Gaming or Stockjobbing    Qu  Whether it must not be ruinous for a Nation to sit down to game be it with Silver or with Paper    Qu  Whether therefore the circulating Paper in the late ruinous Schemes of  France and England was the true Evil and not rather the circulating thereof without Industry And whether the Bank of Amsterdam where Industry had been for so many Years subsisted and circulated by Transfers on Paper doth not clearly decide this Point    Qu  Whether there are not to be seen in America fair Towns wherein the People are well lodged fed and cloathed without a Beggar in their Streets although there be not one Grain of Gold or Silver current among them    Qu  Whether these People do not exercise all Arts and Trades build Ships and navigate them to all Parts of the World purchase Lands till and reap the Fruits of them buy and sell educate and provide for their Children Whether they do not even indulge themselves in foreign Vanities    Qu  Whether whatever Inconveniencies those People may have incurred from not observing either Rules or Bounds in their PaperMoney yet it be not certain that they are in a more flourishing Condition have larger and better built Towns more Plenty more Industry more Arts and Civility and a more extensive Commerce than when they had Gold and Silver current among them    Qu  Whether a View of the ruinous Effects of absurd Schemes and Credit mismanaged  so as to produce Gaming and Madness instead of Industry can be any just Objection against a national Bank calculated purely to promote Industry    Qu  Whether a Scheme for the Welfare of this Nation should not take in the whole Inhabitants And whether it be not a vain Attempt to project the flourishing of our Protestant Gentry exclusive of the Bulk of the Natives    Qu  Whether therefore it doth not greatly concern the State that our Irish Natives should be converted and the whole Nation united in the same Religion the same allegiance and the same Interest And how this may most probably be effected    Qu  Whether an Oath testifying Allegiance to the King and disclaiming the Pope's Authority in Temporals may not be justly required of the Roman Catholicks And whether in common Prudence or Policy any Priest should be tolerated who refuseth to take it    Qu  Whether there have not been Popish Recusants And if so whether it would be right to object against the foregoing Oath that all would take it and none think themselves bound by it    Qu  Whether those of the Church of  Rome in converting the Moors of Spain or the Protestants of France have not set us an Example which might justify a similar Treatment of themselves if the Laws of Christianity allowed thereof    Qu  Whether compelling Men to a Profession of Faith is not the worst Thing in Popery and consequently whether to copy after the Church of Rome therein were not to become Papists ourselves in the worst Sense    Qu  Whether nevertheless we may not imitate the Church of Rome in certain Places where Jews are tolerated by obliging our Irish Papists at stated Times to hear Protestant Sermons And whether this would not make Missionaries in the Irish Tongue useful    Qu  Whether the mere Act of hearing without making any Profession of Faith or joining in any Part of Worship be a Religious Act And consequently whether their being obliged to hear may not consist with the Toleration of Roman Catholics    Qu  Whether if penal Laws should be thought Oppressive we may not at least be allowed to give Premiums And whether it would be wrong if the Public encouraged Popish Families to become Hearers by paying their HearthMoney for them    Qu  Whether in granting Toleration we ought not to distinguish between Doctrines purely Religious and such as affect the State    Qu  Whether the Case be not very different in regard to a Man who only eats Fish on Fridays says his Prayers in Latin or believes Transubstantiation and one who professeth in Temporals a Subjection to foreign Powers who holdeth himself absolved from all Obedience to his natural Prince and the Laws of his Country who is even persuaded it may be Meritorious to destroy the Powers that are    Qu  Whether therefore a Distinction should not be made between mere Papists and Recusants And whether the latter can expect the same Protection from the Government as the former    Qu  Whether our Papists in this Kingdom can complain if they are allowed to be as much Papists as the Subjects of France or of the Empire    Qu  Whether there is any such Thing as a Body of Inhabitants in any Popish Country under the Sun that profess an absolute Submission to the Pope's Orders in Matters of an indifferent Nature or that in such Points do not think it their Duty to obey the civil Government    Qu  Whether since the Peace of Utrecht Mass was not celebrated and the Sacraments administer'd in divers Diocese's of Sicily notwithstanding the Pope's interdict    Qu  Whether every Plea of Conscience is to be regarded Whether for Instance the German Anabaptists Levellers or fifth Monarchy Men would be tolerated on that Pretence    Qu  Whether Popish Children bred in Charity Schools when bound out in Apprentiship to Protestant Masters do generally continue Protestants    Qu  Whether a Sum which would go but a little Way towards erecting Hospitals for maintaining and educating the Children of the Native Irish might not go far in binding them out Apprentices to Protestant Masters for Husbandry useful Trades and the service of Families    Qu  Whether if the Parents are overlooked there can be any great Hopes of Success in converting the Children    Qu  Whether there be any Instance of a People's being converted in a Christian Sense otherwise than by preaching to them and instructing them in their own Language    Qu  Whether Catechists in the Irish Tongue may not easily be procured and subsisted  And whether this would not be the most practicable Means for converting the Natives    Qu  Whether it be not of great Advantage to the Church of Rome that she hath Clergy suited to all Ranks of Men in gradual Subordination from Cardinals down to Mendicants    Qu  Whether her numerous poor Clergy are not very useful in Missions and of much influence with the People    Qu  Whether in defect of able Missionaries Persons conversant in low Life and speaking the Irish Tongue if well instructed in the first Principles of Religion and in the Popish Controversy though for the rest on a Level with Parish Clerks or the Schoolmasters of Charity Schools may not be fit to mix with and bring over our poor illiterate Natives to the established Church Whether it is not to be wished that some Parts of our Liturgy and Homilies were publickly read in the Irish Language And whether in these Views it may not be right to breed up some of the better sort of Children in the Charity Schools and qualify them for Missionaries Catechists and Readers    Qu  Whether there be any Nation of Men governed by Reason And yet if there was not whether this would be a good Argument  against the use of Reason in public Affairs    Qu  Whether as others have supposed an Atlantis or Eutopia we also may not suppose an Hyperborean Island inhabited by reasonable Creatures    Qu  Whether an indifferent Person who looks into all Hands may not be a better Judge of the Play than a Party who sees only his own    Qu  Whether one whose End is to make his CountryMen think may not gain his End even though they should not think as he doth    Qu  Whether he who only asks Asserts And whether any Man can fairly confute the Querist    Qu  Whether the Interest of a Part will not alway be preferred to that of the Whole  FINIS  ERRATA  PAGE Line for inexhaustable  r
