 SETHONA A TRAGEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand MDCCLXXIV Price One Shilling and Sixpence  PROLOGUE  Written by Mr CUMBERLAND  Spoken by Mr REDDISH  IN classic times as learned authors say  When  Greek  or  Roman  wits produc'd a play  The herald  Prologue  'ere the sports began  Fairly stept forward and announc'd the plan  In few plain words he ran the fable through  And without favour publish'd all he knew  An honest custom for the plan was clear  The scene was simple and the Muse sincere  No tawdry fashions warp'd the public taste  The times were candid and the stage was chaste  Can we expect in these enlighten'd days  A courtly age should hold such vulgar ways  Or that a blabbing prologue should disclose  Scenes which no Muse of fashion ever shows  No Sirs  Sethona is the lady's name  She lives at Memphisof unsullied fame  A Tyrant woo'd herbut she lik'd another  And once 'twas fear'd her lover was her brother  As for the rest a little patience borrow  The  Chronicle  will tell you all tomorrow  Authors are now so over modest grown  They publish all men's writings but their own  But let no living bard conceive offence  Nor take the general in a partial sense  Peace to all such the lab'ring bee must feed  From flow'r to flow'r perchance from weed to weed  And should the comb unwelcome flavour yield  The fault's not in the fabric but the field  The critic wasp mean while upon the wing  An insect fraught with nothing but a sting  Disturbs th' inaustrious hive for malice sake  Marring that honey which he cannot make  An absent bard engag'd in distant war  This night appears by proxy at your bar  As o'er Arabia's wilds he took his way  From sultry Ormus and the realms of day  His active mind superior to its toil  Struck out these scenes upon the burning soil  No cooling grottoes no umbrageous groves  To win the Graces and allure the Loves  No Heliconian fount wherein to dip  And slake the burning fever on his lip  Before him all is desart waste and dry  Above him flames the tyrant of the sky  Around his temples gath'ring whirlwinds fight  And drifts of scorching dust involve the light  Oh snatch your Poet from impending death  And on his shrine we'll hang his votive wreath  EPILOGUE  Written by Mr GARRICK  Spoken by Mrs BARRY  AS it is prov'd by  scholars  of great  fame  That  Gipsies  and  Egyptians  are the same  I from my throne of  Memphis  shift the scene  And of the  Gipsies  now step forth the Queen  Suppose that with a blanket on my shoulder  An old strip'd jacket petticoat still older  With ebon locks in wild disorder spread  The diadem  a clout about my head  My dingy Majesty here takes her stand  Two children at my back and one in hand  With curtsey thusand arts my mother taught  I'll tell your fortunes as a Gipsey ought  Too far to reach your palmsI'll mark your traces  Which fate has drawn upon your comely faces  See what is written on the cutward skin  And from the  title page  know all  within  First in  your  faces  To the Upper Gallery  I will mark each letter  Had they been cleaner I had seen 'em better  Yet through that cloud some rays of sunshine dart  An unwash'd face oft veils the cleanest heart  That honest  Tar  with  Nancy  by his side  So loving leering whispers thus his bride  " I love you Nancy faith and troth I do  " Sound as a biscuit is my heart and true  " Indeed dear Johnny so do I love you"  Love on fond pair indulge your inclination  You ne'er will know for want of education  Hate infidelity  and  separation  Some  Cits  I see look dull and some look gay  As in ChangeAlley they have pass'd the day  City  Barometers  for as stocks go  What  Mercury  they have is  high  or  low  What's in the wind which makes that  Patriot  vere  He smells a  contract  or  lott'ry  next year  Some  Courtiers  too I see whose features low'r  Just turning  patriots  they begin to  sour  What in your faces can a Gipsey see  Ye  Youths  of fashion and of family  What are we not to hope from taste and rank  All prizes in this lotteryBlankblankblank  Now for the  Ladies  I no lines can spy  To tell their fortunesand I'll tell you why  Those finedrawn lines which would their fate displey  Are by the hand of  fashion  brush'd away  Pity it is on beauty's fairest spot  Where  nature  writes her best they make a blot  I'd tell our  Author's  fortune but his face  As distant far as India from this place  Requires a keener sight than mine to view  His  FORTUNE  can be only told by  YOU

ORUS  the High Priest sacrificing at the altar  SETHONA  kneeling before the statue of  OSIRIS  SETHONA  THOU pow'r divine whose awful presence shakes  This sacred fane if e'er thy pitying hand  Was stretch'd to helpless mortals in distress  O now protect a weak defenceless maid  From Amasis whose hands are drench'd in blood  The blood of Menes dearlamented youth  And Seraphis my father Egypt's king  ORUS  advancing from the altar  Lo the devoted victims are consum'd  And all due rites of sacrifice perform'd  Upon the altar of the great Osiris  SETHONA  Thou sacred prophet whose enlighten'd mind  Pierces the shades of dark futurity  What have the gods decreed Am I condemn'd  To wed my father's murderer The man  Who tore my destin'd husband from my arms  Ev'n at the altar e'er the rites began  And left me thus to sorrow to despair  ORUS  Daughter of grief Sethona every hour  Changes the state of things To day the sea  Rous'd by the Northern wind assails the sky  And wears the face of ruin E'er the morn  Unveils her eyes it smooths its ruffl'd brow  And holds a mirrour to the stars of heav'n  SETHONA  Orus I owe this emblem of my fate  To thy humanity What ray of joy  Can pierce the deep dark dwelling of my soul  Where Menes lies entomb'd  ORUS  Time will unfold  More than thy hopes could cherish Know this night  This present hour is pregnant with events  To me in part reveal'd  SETHONA  Ha what events  The dimest shade of hope in grief like mine  Fancy may work to comfort  ORUS  As I stood  Before the altar of Ammonian Jove  In fervent meditation I beheld  The tow'rs of Memphis tottering and the Nile  Rushing thro' all her gates I heard a sound  As when the winds contending in their caves  Disturb the mountains saw the shadowy lines  Of banner'd armies closing in the air  Streaming with blood a headless trunk appear'd  Grasping a scepter O'er him strode in steel  The warlike form of Menes Last uprose  Dim thro' the gleam of arms a hoary head  Encircled with a gorgeous diadem  It seem'd thy father  SETHONA  Seraphis my father  And Menes hapless ghosts  ORUS  Peace to their shades  'Twas but a vision of the mental eye  Th' unbodied semblances of future things  And not departed spirits  SETHONA  Hope begins  To dawn upon me In thy words I feel  The force of inspiration Yet my grief  Succeeds like darkness to the transient gleam  Of some deluding meteor Can the tomb  Give up its dead Can Menes hear my voice  And rescue me from the detested arms  Of Amasis Can Seraphis restore  The long extinguish'd glories of his line  Can I forget my sorrow Idle dreams  ORUS  And yet such dreams may take substantial forms  Three days have not elaps'd since from this fane  Menes was torn by Amasis as yet  No certain tidings of his fate are known  Tho' fame reports his death Today his friend  Noble Otanes by the king's command  From Sais came where he hath govern'd long  Averse from courts with dignity and fame  Worthy his high desent from Egypt's kings  SETHONA  Oh might I see him e'er the Tyrant's rage  Destroys his sacred life  ORUS  Fear not his rage  The fate of Menes has already rais'd  A storm in Memphis that may shake his throne  Otanes on his entrance has received  The highest honours by a subject borne  Enter  MYRTAEUS  Orus retires to the altar  MYRTAEUS  Prepare the nuptial rites The king approaches  SETHONA  Alas Myrtaeus whither shall I fly  Who can protect me innocence is weak  And tears like the cold chrystal drops in caves  Can only serve to petrify the heart  Of Amasis  MYRTAEUS  His soul is fierce but love  SETHONA  Speak not of love from Amasis nor think  So meanly of my virtue of my faith  And firm affection for departed Menes  Tho' dead his image dwells within my soul  And leaves no room for othersall my joys  Were grafted on him Now the tree is fall'n  And I am left to wither on the ground  MYRTAEUS  Recal not thus the mem'ry of the dead  Nor rend the veil which nature kindly draws  Between us and the tomb and yet my soul  When thou complain'st seems covetous of grief  I could sit down and listen to thy tale  Devour each piteous circumstance of woe  And mourn with thee for ever  SETHONA  Oh Myrtaeus  He was a friend most worthy of thy tears  Humane susceptible of the distress  Of others but unshaken by his own  Gentle in peace but terrible in war  As the rude blast that from our desart pours  Dark with the fate of armies  MYRTAEUS  Ah forbear  You pierce my very soul  SETHONA  O could I fly  To some brown desart far remov'd from man  And in the shade of some poor lonely tree  Beside a ling'ring stream in silence sit  And muse from morn to eve from eve to morn  Or tell my sister of the sky that wanes  With me apace the story of my woe  There undisturb'd I might devour my grief  Like some sad ghost that nightly sits alone  Pale bending o'er the slowly twinkling flame  Of a decaying meteor  flourish of trumpets  MYRTAEUS  'Tis the king  SETHONA  Whither shall I resort Amid my foes  I stand alone unpitied and forlorn    Exit Sethona  Enter  AMASIS  attended  AMASIS  Why flies Sethona Now the voice of mirth  Resounds thro' Egypt and propitious stars  Combine to bless this hour  MYRTAEUS  At thy approach  She suddenly withdrew tears in her eyes  Her looks expressing anguish and despair  AMASIS  The mere caprice of women still afraid  Or seemingly afraid of what they wish  They fly but to delude  MYRTAEUS  She sighs and talks  Of love and Menes in such mournful strain  As fills each eye with sympathetic tears  She will not hear of comfort Time perhaps  And gentle means may sooth her mind to peace  But force might now be fatal  AMASIS  Fear not that  Inform the princess we attend her presence  MYRTAEUS  Too well she knows it    Exit Myrtaeus  ORUS  descending from the altar  Sovereign of the Nile  Let not my words offendThe gods forbid  The solemn rites Whilst in my hand I held  The victim's heart it burst and on the ground  Dissolv'd away  AMASIS  Then let another bleed  ORUS  Dare I advise the nuptials were delay'd  Till some propitious idle hour of peace  For whilst the Ethiopian in his wrath  Threatens invasion fame and glory call  For deeds of arms and dost thou yield to love  AMASIS  Presumptious priest thy sanctity thy age  And all those mystic symbols of thy god  Shall not protect theespeak the omens fair  ORUS  O King 'tis not for mortals to belie  The sacred will of heaven The earth itself  Teems with uncommon births The tombs appear  Deserted by their dead The air is fill'd  With sounds the streets with unsubstantial forms  Great Ammon's helmet nods upon his brow  Whilst he declares ambiguous oracles  And frowns on Egypt  AMASIS  Let him shroud the sun  In tenfold darkness shake the solid earth  Subvert the broadbas'd pyramids disclose  The oozy bottom of the frighted Nile  My purpose stands unmov'd Then hence away  Let my commands be oracles to thee  And Ammon may be silent    Exit Orus  Enter  SETHONA  and  MYRTAEUS  AMASIS  How long Sethona wilt thou arm those eyes  With cold disdain against me Thus how long  At awful distance must I breathe my vows  Of love and constancy The hour is come  The nuptial feast prepar'd and yet thou shun'st  My longing arms as if contagion sprung  From every touch  SETHONA  My looks have not deceiv'd  My soul detests thy person and thy name  Hast thou not been the scourge of all my race  The bane of all my joys and can'st thou hope  Returns of love for unexampl'd wrongs  AMASIS  Forgive the past The gods themselves forgive  I have been much to blame But if sincere  RepentanceIf the pangs of keen remorse  Could e're attone for guilt I stand absolv'd  And hope for thy forgivenessHope for more  Thy loveFor which alone I risqu'd my life  And dar'd perdition  SETHONA  Ha it is a crime  To listen to thy wordsI'll hear no more  My love is not for thee The guilty thought  Wou'd shake this sacred temple and profane  The presence of the godsThe shades of night  The midnight hour of silence the dark tomb  Of Seraphis my father the long line  Of ancestry that darkly rest in death  Within the sacred pyramids on these  My melancholly soul delights to dwell  There let me wander and indulge my woes  AMASIS  Can unavailing sorrow sooth the dead  Deep are their slumbers deaf their ear to woe  Or did their spirits hover roundcan joy  Arise from our distress Can those they lov'd  Afford them pleasure by incessant tears  Then weep no moreMount thou thy father's throne  Egypt shall yield her sceptre to thy hand  And Africk's nations bend beneath thy sway  SETHONA  Could'st thou enthrone me 'midst the stars of heav'n  And say the world that rolls beneath thy feet  And all these splendid orbs around are thine  I would reject them as the price of guilt  Though press'd with all the miseries of life  AMASIS  Enough of argument Know then this hour  Shall make thee mine shall bend thee to my arms  Shall change these haughty frowns and vain complaints  To gentle smiles and murmurings of love  SETHONA  Then know my soul amidst my ruin'd state  Maintains the dignity of Egypt's kings  Looks down upon theeThreats to me are vain  My soul contemns them all  AMASIS  By Egypt's gods  Thou'rt sovereign of my heart the full extent  Of all my wishesHigh in regal state  Thou shalt command the nations Princes kings  The Nile the ocean to thy feet shall bring  Their yearly tribute Still my soul shall dwell  On thy perfections Love shall crown our days  With joy with transport  seizing her  SETHONA  Spare me Amasis  I beg not for my life I wish to die  But if my tears my prayers can move thy heart  O let my wearied soul forsake the world  In all its native innocence  AMASIS  Arise  Arise Sethona Dost thou think my love  A spark to be extinguish'd by a tear  A flame to be blown out with sobs and sighs  A soft impression melted by the breath  Of pity NoAnd wouldst thou not despise  Such cold affection Soon within my arms  Thy strange aversion shall be chang'd to love  And thou shalt wonder at thy own perverseness  SETHONA  Nonever never  AMASIS  To the altar  SETHONA  Here  Here let me perish  AMASIS  Thus I bear thee hence  SETHONA  Inhuman man tomorrow  AMASIS  Nothis hour  This moment  SETHONA  TyrantI will not betray  My faith to Menes  AMASIS  Menes is no more  SETHONA  Then grant this hour to grief  AMASIS  Thou plead'st in vain  In vain thou striv'staway  SETHONA  fainting  O Menes Menes  AMASIS  Ha whence this paleness This is no deceit  The blood retires A transitory death  O'erwhelms her sensesBear her to our halls    Amasis and Attendants lead her out    Enter  MENES  suddenly  ORUS  following  ORUS  Menes forbear  MENES  It was Sethona's voice  ORUS  Rash youth thy frenzy ruins all our hopes  MENES  As well thou

my determin'd aim  Trust to my conduct  ORUS  Whilst this storm of rage  Darkens thy reason hence thou shalt not stir  Dost thou despise my councilHast thou lost  All reverence for my friendship for my age  And sacred function Is the life I saved  Unworthy of thy gratitudethy care  Young man this frenzy suits not with thy fame  A nobler passion now demands thy sword  Egypt amidst her tears looks

Sethos' son  Is nephew to the king and Egypt's heir  His headlong fury breaks through my designs  I must invent some scheme to check his rage  And stop the progress of his illtim'd love  'Till from

calmbut let me hear it all  MENES  That day on which we stood before the gods  With willing vows to consecrate our loves  The tyrant's guards assaulted me unarm'd  And tore me from Osiris and from thee  Thro' paths unknown they led me to a cell  Cast me in chains then raising from the floor  A pond'rous marble to my view disclos'd  A dark deep pit a dreary sepulchre  Headlong they threw me down

 Ye gods  MENES  Then rising up I crept along the walls  From place to place and often in my arms  Embrac'd th' embalm'd dead Thro' many a cell  I wander'd cheerless When a hollow sound  Roll'd

disapprov'd of thee A subject born  A minister in trust didst thou not seize  Thy master's throne by perfidy Pursue  His life with rancour Trample on thy foes  And scourge the world as w  h the wrath of heav'n  Rous'd by a nation's woes this great revolt  I meditated long My duty done  I leave the rest to heav'n  AMASIS  Dost thou confess  Thy crime  ORUS  My virtue When the aged king  On thy revolt amidst his flying host  Was headlong borne into the Nile and there  Suppos'd to perish Of the ancient race  Two infant princes were by me conceal'd  In hopes one day I might restore the line  The heir of empire and the only son  Of Sethos younger brother to the king  One died in youth The other still remains  AMASIS  Thou hoary traitor tell me where Or death  ORUS  My lips are seal'd Not prompted by my feare  I spoke but from the fulness of a heart  Exulting in its enmity to thee  AMASIS  Prepare to feel the torture  ORUS  That I scorn  The more I suffer in a virtuous cause  The more my glory When we vanquish fear  Tyrants may rage in vain To me thy frowns  And menaces are triumphs  AMASIS  to his guards  Bear him hence  And prove his fortitude  ORUS  When death awaits  I wou'd not seem to linger    Exit Orus guarded  AMASIS  Well he bears  The weight of his misfortune Seraphis  And Menes too must die He still appear'd  Of doubtful origin Perhaps the son  Of Sethos Doubts are vain 'Tis folly now  To trust to fortune In these cells they lie  To his guards two of whom enters the cells    A Storm Thunder    Enter  SETHONA  distractedly  SETHONA  Osiris thunders yet the tyrant lives  Whilst Seraphis and Menes are no more  O that my spirit like that transient beam  Would take its course upon the veering winds  AMASIS  Why com'st thou thus Sethona Hence retire  SETHONA  not observing him  It is the melancholy bird of night  Perch'd on that mould'ring battlement that screams  Her boding notes of woe Ye hideous forms  That dimly rise upon the night and float  In the wild tempest of the troubled air  Roll not your mournful voices on the storm  Away Your awful gestures are in vain  Allall my fears are vanquish'd by my woes  AMASIS  She must not tarry here  SETHONA  What groan was that  In that dark cell I heard the sound of chains  This is my way that taper shall direct  My steps Ye awful spirits of my race  I come to join you in your dark repose  going  AMASIS  Sethona stop Let me convey thee hence  Why dost thou gaze upon the vaulted roof  As if some god descended or the heav'ns  Were open'd to thy view  SETHONA  The cloud is broke  Behold him mounted on the cherub's wing  His white beard streams in air The red drops fall  Upon me He was old Hard was the heart  And ruthless was the hand  AMASIS  She heeds me not  Excess of grief has almost quench'd the light  Of reason in her mind  SETHONA  Was ever love  Like mine Pale as the watry cloud his face  Cold cold his breast and silent is his tongue  His ruby lips Sethona like the bee  Suck'd honey from the rose I knew not then  He was my brother  AMASIS  How her frenzy burns  It runs on Menes  SETHONA  When his bright eyes roll'd  I look'd not at the sun and when he spoke  My fingers dropt the lyre This wound was death  It bleeds it bleeds This breast was void of guilt  Why do I weep Tonight I am the bride  The bride of Amasis These wedding robes  Will prove my winding sheet  AMASIS  Remorse begins  To fasten on my heart I feel I feel  That guilt like the envenom'd scorpion bears  Its own death's sting Her frenzy seems to add  New lustre to her beauty and those eyes  Were not so piercing when the milder beams  Of wisdom temper'd their resistless pow'r  And yet the form alone remains The light  Is gone and like the dim orb of the moon  She labours in eclipse  SETHONA  Hark Who art thou  Give me thy hand  AMASIS  What would'st thou with my hand  SETHONA  Away away wash out these purple stains  AMASIS  It is too late  SETHONA  Too late who murder'd them  AMASIS  Ha how she probes my heart where most inflam'd  SETHONA  Why do I tarry here Let me behold  Their bleeding wounds    going  AMASIS  stopping her  It must not shall not be  SETHONA  Tyrant away My sorrows cure
