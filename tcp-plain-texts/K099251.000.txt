Estate on the Island near a Mill and a Piece of Canes  Enter Whitmore and Lovemore  WHITMORE  SO my dear Charles you are at length after a passage of five weeks three days and odd hours arrived in our little sunburnt island  LOVEMORE  Nothing I'll assure you Whitmore would have brought me on this side the Atlantic but my unconquerable passion for the adorable Louisa Winstone  WHITMORE  Miss Winstone Sir has been long the belle of this island and has been the occasion I already hear of much envy among the ladies and as much passion among the gentlemen But could you obtain nothing more desirable at home that you must needs neglect an Albion flower for a poor drooping Antigua blossom  LOVEMORE  Don't dishonour my Louisa by any odious comparison Before she left England she carried the rose in her cheeks the rainbow in her forehead lightning in her eyes with grace innocence and elegance in her whole frame  WHITMORE  Hush hush man don't be over extravagant I grant Miss Winstone might have possessed all you say upon her first arrival here but you do not know how soon every thing fades in this climate For my own part I cannot say much for her complexion  LOVEMORE  Her complexion Sir I grant you may be a little tanned but I am sure her features ever must remain beautiful My dear Whitmore I am impatient to see her conduct me therefore to her father's wherever it is  WHITMORE  It is just by but I am so engaged with plantation business that I am afraid I shall hardly be able to spare a minute from the toils of the crop However Sir not to baulk so passionate a lover I'll mount you on the best steed I have and follow you like a true 'Squire on the best mule or jack ass on the whole estate But pray Sir would you not chuse a draught of punch after your hot ride from town it is the custom here always to have the bowl in readiness Here Cesar Cesar  CESAR  Coming Massah  WHITMORE  But pray Sir what impression do you receive from the scenes about you in this part of the world  LOVEMORE  Why truly I am at a loss to explain them but they are upon the whole very strange As I journeyed through the different estates I heard as I thought nothing but the cracking and bouncing of fire works but was very soon convinced that the noise proceeded from the smacks of the whips and the correction which is daily and hourly inflicted on the slaves  WHITMORE  Indeed Sir I am sorry to say it but we are obliged to put the whip to a slave as we do a match to powder in order to get it to act at all Cesar I say Cesar  CESAR  Coming Massah coming  yawning  LOVEMORE  How slow the fellow is  yawning  WHITMORE  Every thing Sir is slow in this climate the horses are slow the cattle slow mules slow in short a general sloth hangs upon every thing Cesar Cesar Cesar  bawling hastily  Cesar yawns rubs his eyes and produces the bowl of punch  What Sir were you asleep stupor hangs as naturally upon the dog as mist upon the mountains My service to you Sir  Drinks and hands it to Lovemore  LOVEMORE  Pleasant liquor in troth  Drinks again  WHITMORE  Aye don't drink too much of it though for it may play the devil with you till you are better used to the climate Here Mr Cesar take it away and saddle the young English horse for this gentleman and my manager's mule for me Do you hear  CESAR  Yes Massah me bring um up directly  WHITMORE  If possible do so but I am afraid you will require another nap first  Exit Cesar  LOVEMORE  I should conceive it Sir a very laborious and painful employment to have the inspection of a gang of slaves have there been no efforts made to raise them above their brutal state and to inspire them with the sentiments of man  WHITMORE  Yes Sir there was one man mad enough to make the attempt but it was very speedily found that as the slaves of his own estate improved in intellectual discernment their corporeal faculties relaxed so that the other gentlemen of the island by woeful experience very soon dropped their liberal sentiments and hung the dead weight of ignorance again about them  LOVEMORE  Ignorance undoubtedly is the true cause of slavery  WHITMORE  That is a truth Sir which we find verified every day but pray as you are so passionate an admirer of Miss Winstone why did you not prevent her voyage to this part of the world  LOVEMORE  Why I was then Sir but a minor and though Miss Winstone favored my addresses her father thought Jack Rattoon a better match for her so brought her over to marry him against her consent  WHITMORE  Very true Sir I recollect the whole affair she became on her arrival the adoration of the men in general and very soon grew out of humour with Jack whose face she compared to a large foursop and whose head she declared was as soft as a rotten quaver  LOVEMORE  Pray Sir what are the distinguishing good qualities of the ladies of this part of the world  WHITMORE  Fidelity to their husbands and tenderness to their children  LOVEMORE  The inhabitants too are in general remarked  for their hospitality to strangers as well as their candour and openness to each other  WHITMORE  They are so Sir but these take their rise from the social principle of man's nature and which the want of society creates But here I see Cesar has already prepared and saddled our cattle therefore like a true KnightErrant equip yourself at all points to meet your beauteous Dulcinia  LOVEMORE  That I am already what more would you have  WHITMORE  I will play this romantic youth a trick  aside aloud  Why Sir though it may surprize you it is a custom here whenever any gentleman pays his first visit to the lady he loves to go armed and defended with all the weapons and implements of chivalry  LOVEMORE  Certainly you jest  WHITMORE  No in faith it is an old custom derived from the Spaniards to whom you know these islands first belonged  LOVEMORE  Impossible  WHITMORE  Nay but it is actually so and unless you permit me to arm you like a KnightErrant you will not see Miss Winstone today  LOVEMORE  Why my dear Mr Whitmore you'll make a fool of me  WHITMORE  A fool of you indeed I'll put Minerva's own helmet on your head and you shall then see if you don't look as wise as a judge Here Cesar fetch my old helmet with the shield and sword  CESAR  Yes Massah  LOVEMORE  aside  Certainly this man does not mean to expose me what he says is very true this island belonged to Spain and it is probable that a tincture of chivalry might have been derived from that source besides he is a West Indian and tells the truth  WHITMORE  First Sir let me gird on the sword there  there it is now put the shield thus and now last of all Cesar fetch me the spear  CESAR  There Massah  presenting the spear  LOVEMORE  Upon my word Mr Whitmore if I had known this was necessary I would have brought a compleat suit of armour with me from England  WHITMORE  That would not have done so well perhaps now Sir look at yourself in the first glass you come to and see if you are not as warlike as Jack the Giantkiller  LOVEMORE  I am obliged to you though for making me so  WHITMORE  You have nothing to do Sir but to push your spear against the first rival you meet on the road  LOVEMORE  Rivals Sir I hope to God I shall not meet any  WHITMORE  You will certainly meet a great many Only consider the beauty and accomplishments of the lady She is always surrounded by rivals Sir  Pray by what name do you chuse to be announced to her  LOVEMORE  By my own to be sure James Jeremiah Lovemore Esq  WHITMORE  Pugh pugh the name of Lovemore will be a disgrace to Knighthood call yourself the Knight of the Dreadful Phiz  LOVEMORE  Aye any thing Let us be off as fast as we can  WHITMORE  But harkee Mr Knight can you ride well for if you cannot the horse will certainly throw you as you must expect he'll start at the sight of a man in armour  LOVEMORE  Where then is the use of armour if it exposes a man to new dangers and as for my riding Sir I am by no means secure in my saddle  WHITMORE  Why then there will be an end to your knight hood if you once come to the ground but come Sir our cattle are braying and I long for some new atchievement  LOVEMORE  Aye I wish I don't break my neck  Exeunt ambo  Scene II  An Apartment in the House of Mr Winstone  Enter Louisa and Hannah  LOUISA  It is very true as you say Hannah what is the faith and the truth of artful men Do you think I can have the assurance to hope that Mr Lovemore will renew his addresses especially when he sees me turned as brown as a gipsey  HANNAH  Indeed Cousin Winstone you deserve to be tanned as a punishment for the coquettish airs you practised upon all the men at your first arrival aye Cousin who was then so cruel as yourself  LOUISA  It is cruel Miss Hannah in you to accuse me of being a coquet but girls like you who were never handsome or fair take a pleasure in seeing every one reduced to their own standard  HANNAH  You may talk as you please Miss Winstone when but last week you know Mr Cogwil a rich manager of this island made love to me in your presence what did you do then  LOUISA  What did I do then  HANNAH  Aye how did you look then in truth you looked Miss I can tell you like a windmill stript of its f  s and not a breeze of wind to turn it round  LOUISA  It is better Madam to be without a breeze of wind than to require such cattle as Mr Cogwil to set one in motion  HANNAH  I don't care for your repartees you don't recollect I suppose how you used to dance with one drop your fan for another propose some foolish errand for a third and in short ogle the red coats so much that they no doubt contributed with the rays of the sun to toast you into your present crisp and brown complexion  LOUISA  Pray cousin when were your family the family of the Bananahs accounted wits that you should at this day begin to play it off upon me  HANNAH  You need not I can tell you be so severe for though I was never at Queensquare boarding school as you have been I have received as good an education as you and that though I was never off the island  LOUISA  Pray let us have done scolding and wait Mr  Lovemore's arrival here who is to be introduced to us by his acquaintance Mr Whitmore he may notwithstanding my charms are fled find others more durable in my mind these perhaps will be enough and bring him to my feet without the assistance of any others  HANNAH  I wish you may find it so Miss Winstone but I believe he will be the first man who ever fell at the feet of a plain woman  LOUISA  Nay my dear Coz did you not tell me Mr Cogwil fell at your's  HANNAH  No Miss he did not fall at my feet  LOUISA  Though you were so handsome  HANNAH  Nay Miss if you persist in teazing I will actually complain of it to your papa for it isn't to be borne  Enter old Winstone  WINSTONE  My dear girls take care of yourselves for a man has been just seen on the borders of the estate  clad in a compleat suit of armour he has frightened the slaves from their work startled the mule that carried one of my overseers and been the means of putting out the fellow's shoulder  HANNAH  Good gracious Sir  WINSTONE  Good gracious indeed it is to my thinking a most ungracious piece of business all together for God's sake take care of yourselves  LOUISA  What can he want Sir  WINSTONE  To take you both off I suppose  LOUISA  Oh I won't go with him will you cousin Hannah  HANNAH  Not I go with a man in armour no no a man in nankeen or Russia drab for me  LOUISA  Why don't you arm the negroes Sir  WINSTONE  Here Quacou Quashy  Enter Quacou and Quashy  WINSTONE  Here both of you get my guns load them to the mouth fix on the bayonets and come and keep guard at the door for there is a great gigantic fellow coming to destroy us all  QUACOU AND QUASHY  Lud a mercy Massah  exeunt ambo  LOUISA  Sir the negroes will be afraid and run away you had better arm yourself and take their place  WINSTONE  What you slut expose your old father at his years to have a spear in his guts Oh what a jade  Enter the negroes armed  WINSTONE  Now stand fast and as soon as you see a great white man covered all over with steel plates and platters present your bayonets thus  LOUISA  Sir they will not have courage  WINSTONE  They will I tell you they have both attended me to the field when I commanded the red regiment and served a campaign or two under me  HANNAH  Oh then cousin Heaven defend us from the Commander and his company  LOUISA  So say I I wish we could hide somewhere if it was even with the cold meat in the larder  QUACOU  Massah Quashy afraid of his right hand if he raise it against a white man  WINSTONE  One word for Quashy and a hundred for yourself I see you black rascals you are frightened never mind his right hand but run your bayonets through the white man's heart See see he is coming now do your duty  Enter Lovemore with his spear presented the negroes present their bayonets sneak to the other end of the stage throw them down and run off  WINSTONE  Oh the diabolical poltroons  LOVEMORE  I see Sir you dread my hostile and warlike appearance  WINSTONE  I do in faith dread Sir most dreadfully  LOVEMORE  I perceive your fears but pray dismiss them I come here in quest of an angelic fair one and am  astonished to find myself opposed by a couple of black rivals  WINSTONE  Indeed good Sir I do not understand you nor can I conceive your intention in frightening one of the islanders and two harmless young ladies in his house  LOVEMORE  What a stupid old fellow to be bred in the bowels of chivalry and not know a man in the dress of a Knight  LOUISA  Are not you frightened cousin Hannah  HANNAH  Oh I am like a sensitive plant all over  LOUISA  He must certainly be mad suppose we fall on our knees to him cousin  HANNAH  Aye do Louisa  Enter Mr Whitmore  WHITMORE  Ladies your servant Mr Winstone your servant  whispering Winstone  hush I have made a fool of this man  WINSTONE  Upon my soul so I thought  LOUISA  Only think cousin the man is a fool ha ha  HANNAH  Aye good gracious what a fool ha ha ha  LOVEMORE  Which Sir is the beautiful lady of this castle tell me that I may fall down express the ardour of my unabating passion and pour out my whole soul in raptures at her feet  WINSTONE  Aye which of you Louisa or Hannah is the beautiful lady of this castle  HANNAH  Is it you cousin Winstone  LOUISA  No it is you cousin Hannah This Sir is the beautiful lady of this castle  LOVEMORE  aside  I am sorry that it is from my soul  aloud  Oh inform me which is Miss Winstone that I may grow at her feet and gaze my very sight away  LOUISA  As I live it is Mr Lovemore's voice support me Heaven  HANNAH  Ha ha ha Mr Lovemore and mad with love for my poor tanned sunburnt cousin Winstone  WHITMORE  This Sir Knight is Miss Winstone  WINSTONE  This Sir is my daughter and I Sir am her father  Lovemore looks at Miss Winstone with attention starts back and fetches a deep sigh  WHITMORE  What the Devil Sir Knight is the matter with you you look as chopfallen as Don Quixote when vanquished by the windmills  HANNAH  You have frightened the Knight cousin Louisa  WHITMORE  Most surely Madam your beauty went through his heart like a slug  LOVEMORE  aside  I see my mistake am convinced of my folly and so will be off again to Old England without delay  WINSTONE  The Knight seems to muse  LOVEMORE  aside  Aye I've mused and mused upon the woman till the Muses have led me quite astray  WHITMORE  Pray Sir Knight hold up your head accost the ladies or they will imagine you have lost both your tongue and your teeth and that you cannot so much as mumble  LOVEMORE  Villain dog rascal  pushing his spear at Whitmore  LOUISA  I see the cause of this frolic and anger my lost beauty is the only cause  HANNAH  You see cousin Louisa he has never fallen at your feet  LOUISA  Away you most insipid of all Bananahs  HANNAH  Don't talk of my insipidity cousin for the Knight has found your's out without so much as tasting you  WHITMORE  Lookee Mr Winstone the gentleman is in a calenturea tropical fever Sir  WINSTONE  I wish to my soul he was well out of my house he will be for pinioning me next  LOVEMORE  aside  This damned Creole has been making a dupe of me There is not a woman in the island I dare say beautiful enough to authorize the rank of Knighthood  to Whitmore  Here Sir take your armour again  flinging his sword shield and helmet in a passion at Whitmore  put them on the next fool you meet for I'll not be ass enough to wear the lion's skin any longer  WHITMORE  It is a pity that you flung it off for by my soul it became you mightily  WINSTONE  I wish Sir good Mr Viper you would shake your rattles somewhere else  LOUISA  Faithless Mr Lovemore am I the woman to whom you swore such unconquerable passion  LOVEMORE  Indeed Madam I cannot believe that you are  LOUISA  Blush Sir for your perfidy your ill manners and your folly  LOVEMORE  I do not know Madam whether I blush but I can assure you I feel very foolish  WHITMORE  Upon my soul you do look very foolish indeed here Quacou gather up my armour put it by but don't attempt to scower it do you hear  exit Quacou with the armour  Hercules it is said Sir has been known to lay his club at a woman's feet but you have done more for you have cast down your helmet shield and spear all at once  Lovemore putting his arms akimbo goes up to Whitmore  Mr Whitmore Sir damme Sir I cannot speak I feel so cursed foolish  all laugh ha ha ha  WINSTONE  I understand you Sir you would tell us that you came express from England to renew your addresses to Miss Winstone But because she has had a fit of the ague and lost a little colour you hang your ears like an ass and crouch like a poor devil of a spaniel  LOVEMORE  That is the real cause indeed  LOUISA  Be under no further embarrassments Sir about me your addresses were always disagreeable and now you perfectly make me detest you come along cousin Hannah  HANNAH  Poor Cousin Winstone  LOUISA  weeping  Oh Hannah the cruel cruel man  exeunt ambo  WINSTONE  You hear Sir my daughter tells you your addresses were always disagreeable  WHITMORE  Aye Sir hear it listen  LOVEMORE  She told me another story Sir in England  LOUISA  Sir do you persist in insulting me  WHITMORE  Yes Madam he is as obstinate as a mule  LOVEMORE  Mr Whitmore Sir your fun becomes offensive  WHITMORE  Then Sir it is of a piece with your love  WINSTONE  Indeed Sir you are rude beyond measure why then if I must I will tell you Sir I will not bear it  LOVEMORE  Nor Sir will I bear an insult from such an old Creole as you are  WINSTONE  Creole or not Sir I've the spirit of the devil  LOVEMORE  The devil Sir was always a coward and you had a great deal of his spirit just now when I appeared in armour and frightened you out of your wits  WINSTONE  aside  Aye that is true enough I was a coward then I must own  aloud  Perhaps Sir you are not acquainted that I am the first man in this country  LOVEMORE  Yes Sir you are as great here as Gulliver was amongst the Lilluputians because they are all less than yourself but come over to Old England the nursery of every thing good and great and you will there Mr Winstone be as small as the same Gulliver was at Broddignag  WINSTONE  I never was so talked to in my life if a slave had said that I would have stabbed him I will go this minute order the shell to be blown and you Sir to be hooted off the estate as a most dangerous incendiary  Exit Winstone  WHITMORE  Do you hear that  LOVEMORE  What then  WHITMORE  Why you won't stay to be hooted will you  LOVEMORE  I am indeed a most precious fool but this business will reform me quite  WHITMORE  I hope it will for you have taken a vast deal of needless trouble ycu did not find the red and white roses in her cheeks as you expected  LOVEMORE  No they were blasted all to nothing and the poor girl herself looked like  WHITMORE  Like what  LOVEMORE  I won't tell you  WHITMORE  How could you be so credulous as to arm yourself at all points but here comes Captain Greville and Mr Wyndham  Enter Greville and Wyndham  WHITMORE  Gentlemen your servant you are come I suppose to take a slice of the old Judge's turtle and a bottle or two of his claret  GREVILLE  We are indeed I hope you will bear us company  WHITMORE  That we cannot do for we are presently to be hooted off the estate but pray give me leave to introduce you both to Mr Lovemore a friend of mine just arrived from England Mr Lovemore  Mr Wyndham and Captain Greville they are both knights of valour and renown and bred in the very bosom of chivalry  WYNDHAM  In conscience Captain he's at his jokes again  GREVILLE  He must in faith for I was born in Ireland and you Wyndham we all know very well was laid by your mother in a piula pear bush for the first week after her delivery in this island for it was there you first learnt to daub your cheeks with a new kind of rouge  LOVEMORE  Pray gentlemen are there any remains of chivalry in this island  WYNDHAM  Chivalry what is that  LOVEMORE  It is usual when a man makes love here the first time to make a fool of himself  GREVILLE  God bless me I thought you knew it was a custom all over the world  LOVEMORE  Is it a practice here I say for a man to clap  a helmet on his head a shield on his arm and to bear a spear in his right hand when he goes to his mistress  GREVILLE  No to be sure ha ha ha you must be a Spaniard by the question  LOVEMORE  Not at all Sir but this man must be the Spaniard for making such a fool of me and who do you think Sir it was to see but a girl as brown as a berry  GREVILLE  Ha ha ha  WHITMORE  Nay Sir that Sir was your own fault for had I not seen your romantic inclination I should'nt have duped you as I have done  WYNDHAM  Pray was Miss Winstone the lady  WHITMORE  Oh yes Sir she was the lady and he has just paid his vows at her feet swore constancy on her hand and is just going to get a vessel to transport her to Salamancha  GREVILLE  Transport her to NegroeLand you mean I  I loved the girl once when she was white but never thought of her after she became a Mulatto  WYNDHAM  In faith she lost a number of lovers in a little time and myself among the number  GREVILLE  Yes she may go and whistle now for her beauty there is one good thing it has broke her of her coquetry she is in as bad a condition as a peacock stript of his plumes  WHITMORE  It is very true and the greater the pity for this poor gentleman has come quite across the Atlantic to see her  GREVILLE  In faith Sir it was bad policy  LOVEMORE  Indeed Sir it was but I hope you are both men of too much honour to publish it about  WYNDHAM  Oh Sir you may depend upon our secrecy  GREVILLE  Harkee Pinguin we will not lose a joke from a squeamish regard to honour we will tell it where ever we go  WYNDHAM  And harkee we must not lose the story of the armour  WHITMORE  No tell it all for if you don't I will for you he has thrown the poor girl into tears and the helmet at my head  LOVEMORE  Come Mr Whitmore let us be off  GREVILLE  No stay Sir you will find the old fellow's table more agreeable than his daughter stay Sir till the evening by which time you will be certain to have forgot the deluding joys of Venus in a goblet or two of foaming liquor for my part I consider his house as an ordinary for the military gentlemen and old Winstone merely as their landlord  WYNDHAM  I see things getting ready for dinner let us retire to the ladies Captain where harkee we shall hear the whole jest out and laugh at the lover till our very sides ach  LOVEMORE  I must request you gentlemen not to listen to the misrepresentation of Mr Winstone whose anger is excited from the imagined slight to his daughter  GREVILLE  aside  You may depend upon us Sir indeed that we will expose you to all the island before the sun sets  exeunt Greville and Wyndham  WHITMORE  Hark hark I hear the shell so let us be off  shell blows  LOVEMORE  To hell if you please  WHITMORE  We are half way there for we are in the torridzone already  Exeunt ambo  Scene III  Enter Louisa and Hannah  HANNAH  Surely you will not persist in your regard for a man who has openly insulted you before your face  LOUISA  Indeed Hannah be it as it will I cannot help loving him he must have loved me sincerely or do you think he would have come across the water I thought that he perfectly looked sublime in his armour  HANNAH  It was a pretty instance of his sublimity to insult my poor uncle as he did indeed I think him a very silly fellow cousin  LOUISA  You are a harsh judge I would give the world to be able once more to bring him to me though the attempt I'm afraid will be as fruitless as that of washing the blackamore white  HANNAH  I could put you in a way now cousin if I chose it to make a blackamore white  LOUISA  Indeed  HANNAH  Aye indeed  LOUISA  Pray teach it me  HANNAH  Teach it you I thank you then for the confession cousin Louisa  LOUISA  The confession what confession  HANNAH  That you are a blackamore  bowing and laughing  LOUISA  This is monstrous ill manners what can you mean by this savage behaviour  HANNAH  To make you humble cousin  Greville enters and listens  GREVILLE  aside  The ladies seem at high words I'll see if I can discover what they are at  HANNAH  Do not be angry cousin Louisa and I will actually put you in a way to recover your lost beauty  LOUISA  By what means pray  HANNAH  First tell me what return you will make me  LOUISA  Why first to endeavour to make you as beautiful as myself and next to turn all the lovers that are tiresome to me over to you where they may vow swear and protest as long as you chuse  HANNAH  What ma'am you would skim the cream of their  affections and give me the sour milk if that is your resolution you may hunt the secret out as you can  LOUISA  The secret how should a girl who has spent all her days in this part of the world have any receipt for beauty I am certain Hannah had you ever known this secret you would have availed yourself of it long ago but I am afraid that sweet face of your's most strongly contradicts what your tongue would pretend to discover  HANNAH  No reflections ma'am upon my face for I am now determined you shall never benefit by it and shall at last die an old maid for your unkindness and incredulity  LOUISA  And you cousin Hannah like a million of old maids before you carry the secret with you to the grave  HANNAH  Fie cousin Winstone is this your English education  GREVILLE  These ladies are certainly by their fondness for secrets female Free masons and I long to hear the secret  LOUISA  An English education Hannah has taught me to subdue all prejudice and foolish credulity and an English boardingschool has early initiated me into every art of adorning the person I am also convinced  this secret of your's had it been good for any thing would have been made use of by in Pall Mall or Sangwine in the Strand amongst their other tinctures and washes  HANNAH  Be as faithless ma'am as you please but as you doubt my secret you may endeavour to guess it and if you have courage to make the trial improve and benefit on this hint  LOUISA  May I never gain my complexion again if I have not found it out but it is a cruel cruel remedy  HANNAH  Pride you know Miss feels no pain had I been as vain as you I might have tried it long ago  LOUISA  But show me my dear Hannah how the operation is performed and I will run the risk of the smart I have heard it glanced at but never accomplished  HANNAH  Oh it is very possible very possible  LOUISA  And will it make me as rosy and as lillylike as ever  HANNAH  It is better than all the washes in the world  LOUISA  Oh then I shall not mind a little pain come  along cousin Hannah let us prepare it for I will certainly try it before I sleep  HANNAH  aside  Conceited vain girl she has no idea of half the torture she must undergo but I will endeavour to lay it on properly and burn her to some purpose  LOUISA  Methinks I see the men already paying me a thousand new compliments you look charmingly to day cries one you bloom like a new rose cries another you are like a perfect Venus rising out of the sea says a third  HANNAH  While you cousin Winstone will be like a new tried piece of gold finer for going thro' the fire  LOUISA  Oh yes quite at changed creature you shall see then cousin how I'll treat the men in their turn  HANNAH  Aye I dare say you will give yourself as many airs as ever  aside  but there is one comfort you will be well burnt for it Here is the receipt cousin  reads it  Bury some cashoo nuts nine days under ground take them up and extract the oil which mix with a little old rum and lay it on the face with a feather and the ninth day after the skin will come off in a mask  LOUISA  Oh come along come along Hannah  HANNAH  Yes cousin you shall be burnt to some purpose  Exeunt ambo  Scene IV  Enter Captain Greville  GREVILLE  Egad I have heard the secret and have a good mind to try it myself but it is very painful and I unfortunately could never bear pain in my life I cut my finger once and the doctor only put a little Turlington to it and the smart I recollect brought tears into my eyes if I should try it now to improve my pretty face and it should pain me I should certainly caper about roar aloud and so blaze the secret all over the island ho ho I'll call one of the black fellows try it on him first and if he endures it I may then venture to try it upon myself apropos here one of them comes here Mr Quacou have you a parcel of cashoo seeds near at hand  QUACOU  Yes Massah I have some for the desert after dinner  GREVILLE  Will you go then and beat the oil out of them and when you have extracted it bring it to me in a phial  QUACOU  What you want it for Massah  GREVILLE  To skin my face to be sure to make me quite  fair take the sun burn off and make the women admire me  QUACOU  Does it make a negroe man white Massah  GREVILLE  It does more for it makes him so lovely that the very white women will be glad to adopt him as a husband but I will tell you it is kept a profound secret from all the blacks least they should become as white as ourselves and so no longer continue in subjection to us  QUACOU  Oh Massah Massah Massah  GREVILLE  There's a secret for you set them about skinning their faces and in a little time they will shake off the yoke and fetters of servitude  QUACOU  Oh Massah me go get the oil directly  exit  GREVILLE  Immediately how easily I have duped the fellow For the value of a black dog I will put him in pickle at once and if possible make him more like the devil than ever he loves his liberty however though old Winstone is in general a kind master and feeds his housenegroes as well as himself however if this feminine piece of business should get to the ears of the women what will they say Let them say what they will I do not care so they do but admire me faith the experiment will do well if as it  gives the black fellow the opportunity of shaking off his chains it should enable me to lead fresh captives in mineBut here he comes already  QUACOU  Massahhaste Massah here is the oil  GREVILLE  You cannot make too much haste then to gain your liberty sit down then and make haste to redeem your freedom  QUACOU  He will burn Massah  GREVILLE  Quite the contraryoil is a sovereign remedy against all inflammations sit down I say  Quacou sits down  Now while I rub it over your face you must shut your eyes or you will suppose you see the devil about younow for ithere it goesyou will find it cool your face amazingly a little upon your nose to take the new rum and spirits of wine out there nowhow do you find yourself  Here the negroe man may wink with his eyes and distort his face as much as he chuses  QUACOU  aside  He burn too much  aloud  ha ha ha Massah try it yourself he quite cool sit down Massah and let me cool you  GREVILLE  A very little of it then  sits down while the negro man puts it on his face  QUACOU  Now

negroe runs off  WYNDHAM  How is this  DOCTOR  I see the gentleman is insane He sees what does not exist His disorder lies deep  WYNDHAM  You mistake Sir for it is merely on the surface  GREVILLE  Aye

Oh my face my face my dear face  exeunt omnes  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  Scene I  A loud Laugh heard behind An Apartment in the House of Mr Whitmore  Enter Lovemore and Whitmore  LOVEMORE  RIDICULE you see pursues me from one end of the island to the other surely all the people who arrive at this period must think the island inhabited by owls  WHITMORE  True there is such a hooting I do not wonder at it for my own part I cannot help laughing as often as it comes across me  LOVEMORE  Why I have been long enough in the island to have furnished a new subject for diversion  WHITMORE  Very true but it is a rule here never to lose a good joke ha ha ha  LOVEMORE  Ha ha ha  mimicking him  that is because there is such a scarcity of bon mots I attempted you saw to laugh at myself but all my laughter made them ha ha ha as loud again as before  WHITMORE  True true to a proverb I pity you indeed  LOVEMORE  Damn your pity if you presume to pity me if you presume to pity me  WHITMORE  What will you then be laughed at in preference  LOVEMORE  Zounds no but you are welcome to beat out my brains  WHITMORE  There is no fun in that if I do that you will make us no more jokes  LOVEMORE  aside  So I see I am a buffoon to the whole island  aloud  What Sir am I a pickled herring a merry Andrew a jack pudding Sir  WHITMORE  Oh yes Sir you are a walking repository of  fun for the whole island a nostrum against the spleen better than bark for the fever or the ague indeed a punch himself could not have pleased us better  LOVEMORE  I see Sir the cause of all this affected risibility The imagined slight put upon a West Indian female has turned all the heads here both young and old into the soft texture of the calabash and their hearts into the ratling nature of a tropical sand box  WHITMORE  No Sir they laugh from their souls I believe I do from mine I must confess even the Council and Assembly laughed at you  LOVEMORE  The Council and Assembly are fools Let them laugh on  WHITMORE  They have sent over too a most diverting anecdote of it to the Parliament in England now if you say they are fools we will indict you for Magnatum Scandalum  LOVEMORE  A pretty instance of their wisdom faith This is more like the government of Lilliputians now than ever I cannot see a woman without a mask all ashamed to shew their faces  WHITMORE  Quite the reverse the shame lies upon you The  mask is only a hint to you to hide yours they indeed put it to theirs as we put the forefinger on the nose to a child thus when it does amiss ah ah  LOVEMORE  Aye I know I was pointed at But I shall leave you to yourselves I am beset on all sides one questions me concerning the lady's beauty another admires my taste and a third exclaims in wonder at my gallantry and in short I am a Don Quixote Sancha Pancha and every thing they think that is mad and ridiculous  Exeunt ambo  Scene II  An Apartment in the House of Mr Winstone  Enter Miss Winstone totally changed from the Effects of the Cushoo Nut and Miss Bananah  LOUISA  Now cousin Hannah what will the impudent adventurer say now  HANNAH  Say why he will not know you to be the same person  LOUISA  Oh I am so lovely now he would perfectly pine out his soul at my feet  HANNAH  But you would not let him would you  LOUISA  Not let him I am determined he shall die yes he shall die for it I'll assure you Hannah  HANNAH  That is the height of cruelty cousin But take care for he is this very moment in sight with Mr Whitmore they neither of them will know you I dare say  LOUISA  Let him come for I can now meet him with confidence alas he little knows how much my vanity has cost me  HANNAH  Nor any one else indeed You perfectly danced a rigadoon for the first hour after the oil was laid on  LOUISA  I actually felt as if my face was the prey of scorpions and centipedes or of musquitos  HANNAH  Yes and how you began to abuse the man Lord Lord I thought you would have died under the operation  LOUISA  But now it is over how charmingly I feel who would not undergo a little pain to redeem lost beauty or to give delight to the man we love  HANNAH  You had love and love enough for you may recollect you said you thought the very God of Love himself was running his sharp pointed arrows into  your face which indeed he could not have done had he not blinded you before  LOUISA  Indeed it was the most comical and at the same time the most painful sensation I ever felt  HANNAH  You were one moment laughing the next crying then stamping and then sneezing that upon my word I began to tremble for you myself  LOUISA  Verses and sonnets now Hannah you shall see will fly from all quarters one bard will praise my eye brows another my complexion and all together join in chorus on the subject of my skill fortitude and resolution  HANNAH  Why may you not be satyrised and lampooned instead of being praised and commended why not nicknamed and laughed at for your folly and in short put in the class of those animals who actually cast their skins off  LOUISA  Why if I am classed in that rank I will send the skin of my face to England there to be deposited in the BritishMuseum and preserved amongst the other curiosities of the place  HANNAH  It would have been a greater curiosity cousin Winstone to have seen you in pickle yourself as well as the curious graft of the cushoo upon the body of the pine ha hal ha  LOUISA  How different we look now Hannah You look just as I did when the oil began to poison my face you seem under the operation now and not I My stars what a contrast ha ha ha  HANNAH  By the sun and moon Miss your vanity is enough to turn your head presume to shew me any more airs or make any more odious comparisons and I will very shortly render your face as yellow as I now have made it fair  LOUISA  You understand the art Hannah and have practised it too I believe in rendering your face all colours  HANNAH  Good gracious me  LOUISA  You are a witch Hannah  HANNAH  A witch cousin Winstone  LOUISA  Yes a witch for making yourself so brown and me so fair  HANNAH  I will tell my uncle Winstone you call me a witch  LOUISA  And I will tell him you poisoned my face till my head and every feature grew as large as a bloated toad not only that but as he is Judge of this island he shall bring you under the cognizance of that law made against witchcraft which will most certainly condemn you to be burnt  HANNAH  And you cousin Winstone as the witches subject every thing belonging to her you know should be consigned to the flames  LOUISA  In truth Hannah I think it would be to the interest of us both to keep the secret as long as possible However I must make haste to shew myself and the astonishing transformation that has been wrought in me so come along  exeunt ambo  Scene II  An Apartment in the House of Mr Whitmore  Enter Whitmore and Lovemore  WHITMORE  Patience patience Mr Lovemore  LOVEMORE  This is not a country to learn patience in I am something like Orpheus who was fool enough to go to hell to fetch back his wife Eurydice  WHITMORE  Aye Euridice Euridice he cried as you did Miss Winstone  LOVEMORE  In one word Mr Whitmore I begin to detest this little damn'd spot more than ever  WHITMORE  You would not even now raffle for the lady I suppose  LOVEMORE  No by heaven I see I must take consolation with a black wench at last  WHITMORE  Poor fellow I pity thee  LOVEMORE  Damn it you are always pitying me though the very first to expose me  WHITMORE  I sincerely pity thee to think thou shouldst have come all this way in quest of an angel of light yet be obliged to take up with one who has so much affinity to the devil  LOVEMORE  There it is Now I suppose you will tell all the Island  WHITMORE  To be sure to be sure man I would'nt lose a joke for the world ha ha ha  LOVEMORE  Jokes one would think were as scarce as drops of rain and that the inhabitants stood with their mouths open to catch and swallow them down But what Sir has become of Miss Winstone all this while She has been now ill near a fortnight I think  WHITMORE  Yes your cold armour struck such a damp to her soul that she has been laid up with the ague ever since  LOVEMORE  Mum for that I'll embark immediately Your vermin in this part of the world are very fond of fresh English flesh my legs are now blistered with the knats my toes devoured by chiggers a centipes stung my nose the other night and while I was at dinner a few days since just as I was about to taste a bit of the most delicious part of the turtle behold to the admiration of the company a large cock roach flew pop into my mouth  WHITMORE  It must have been what we call a drummer in this part of the world  LOVEMORE  I don't know what it was but it was the most nauseous morsel I ever tasted in my life  WHITMORE  You spit it up I suppose  LOVEMORE  Oh no it followed the turtle down my throat  WHITMORE  Poor fellow I pity thee  LOVEMORE  Damn it you are always pitying me  WHITMORE  Because thou art always deserving it I will then if you please accompany you to the water side and pity you there for the last time  LOVEMORE  I wish I was well out at sea with all my heart I have already been drank into a fever when I meant most to drink healths and am indeed so apprehensive of a famine that I wish to get back again as fast as I can  WHITMORE  Do not be afraid of that I have an antidote against it  LOVEMORE  Pray tell me what it is  WHITMORE  It is daily practised by our negroes and it is thisto bind the belly hard  LOVEMORE  To bind the belly Why is it not a very savage custom  WHITMORE  To bind it externally I mean with a handkerchief or band thus  shewing him  LOVEMORE  But how does it compensate for the loss of food It appears to me worse than the Russian bread made of sawdust  WHITMORE  Why you see the sensation of pain arising from hunger is produced by the action of the two coats of the stomach acting upon each other now the bandage confining the stomach and preventing this action of course takes away the pain This therefore is one argument among many others to prove that digestion is performed by the action of the mastication of the stomach and not by putrefaction as some physicians erroneously supposed  LOVEMORE  This indeed is natural and obvious enough but it certainly cannot support a man as you would have me believe I should be devilishly loth to be served in that manner  WHITMORE  It answers so well Sir that a negroe deprived of his usual food and at the very moment without an ounce to support nature will continue at his work for many hours  LOVEMORE  It is a rare custom indeed I will publish it at my return to England as a precious preservative  to all hungry poets extravagant rakes and proud beggars but Sir as you are about this could'nt you teach your slaves to chew their cud at once they are the only beasts of burthen that do not I believe  WHITMORE  That would be bad policy It would be to open a second stomach when we could not answer the cravings of the first  LOVEMORE  Oh I recollect the reason now of your putting the mouthpiece upon them but in case that should not answer and they should by chance slip any thing down the throat egad you'd let it choak them by confining the stomach  WHITMORE  That is a reason founded in your own ingenuity  LOVEMORE  Oh Mr Whitmore slavery is a damned thing I was near flinging an overseer t'other day into a cauldron of hot liquor for flogging a slave beyond his deserts Here comes Captain Wyndham bringing laughter and ridicule along with him I dare say  Enter Wyndham  WYNDHAM  Gentlemen your humble servant What Mr Lovemore musing again upon that dear fair one the adorable Miss Winstone  WHITMORE  Wyndham thouseest things sacred and profane conspire  against the poor fellow Women ugly and handsome insult him to his face spinsters and decayed matrons ridicule and laugh at him behind his back  WYNDHAM  Give thyself no further trouble Lovemore and as for Miss Winstone if she pretends to laugh at you believe me it is on the wrong side of her face for she is now like a bird that had moulted its feathers away  LOVEMORE  I am rejoiced to my soul to hear it any other woman at the point of death would have asked me pardon for the fruitless trouble she had given me  WYNDHAM  It is quite the reverse with her for she did nothing but abuse you I am told and that you in fact run as much in her head as she did once in your heart  LOVEMORE  As she has cast her feathers as you say I am in hopes she will cast her bill likewise and leave off speaking  WYNDHAM  I have just had a commission from old Winstone to bring you and our friend Whitmore to his estate to see a most precious piece of waxwork This he reckons a great curiosity and wishes you to view it before you return to England  LOVEMORE  Waxwork why the sun is sufficient to melt it in this climate  WHITMORE  So I should think and I wonder I never heard of it before Old Winstone is the last man whom I should suppose a connoisseur and so enlightened in natural history that I am certain he would not know the shell of a turtle from that of a crab if it was not that he generally had one or the other every day at his table  WYNDHAM  But come let us proceed without delay I am in hopes of seeing his beautiful daughter and knowing whether her face is grown any browner than it was indeed I am not sorry for it for the sun which tanned her complexion has turned the best spirits of her disposition to vinegar  Exeunt omnes  Scene IV  An Apartment in the House of Mr Winstone in which are placed different Figures in Waxwork a Pedestal standing among the Figures intended for Miss Winstone  Enter old Winstone his Daughter and some Friends  WINSTONE  Now now my dear we will revenge ourselves on this mad unmannerly Englishman now he shall see what he shall see by the shades of our forefathers and of those of Breslaw and Jonas nothing will ever equal ha ha ha  LOUISA  It will do charmingly if I can but keep from laughing Oh I long to make fools of the men ha ha ha  WINSTONE  That you shall do immediately only keep to the pedestal and as soon as he comes be as composed as death  LOUISA  I at this moment hear their feet they are coming greedily on Captain Wyndham swaggering and rattling his sword Mr Whitmore cracking his jokes and poor deceived Mr Lovemore led like an ass in an halter There now I am as still as the sun upon a dial  leans upon the pedestal  Enter Captain Wyndham Lovemore and Whitmore  WINSTONE  Gentlemen your humble servant Mr Lovemore notwithstanding our late misunderstanding I have invited you here to see these precious figures in waxwork so that return when you will to to England you will be able to tell them old Winstone did not spend all his time in digging cane holes or erecting windmills or whirligigs on his estate  WYNDHAM  Oh Sir quite the reverse I have been just telling him you were one of the greatest philosophers of the age and these figures convince me of it for they are very fine very fine indeed  WHITMORE  They are very fine very fine indeed  LOVEMORE  But the statue of that lady represented as leaning  upon the pedestal is the most like the dear creature your daughter who won my heart in England  WYNDHAM  Upon my soul she is very handsome  looking at her with his glass  LOVEMORE  I observe Sir however that there is a degree of strength in the lines of the face and though the figure represents a person asleep it is like one under the painful pressure and influence of the nightmare  WINSTONE  Just so Sir my poor daughter could never sleep without it Blooded continually but indeed it was of little service for her poor dear mother fell a victim to it herself  WHITMORE  Aye poor soul you should tell Mr Lovemore Sir that the staggers and the nightmare are the prevailing complaints of this island  LOVEMORE  That I can well believe as I have been staggered at every thing I have heard since my arrival Oh this divine creature Sir she takes up all my attention  WHITMORE  So it seems But pray who does this black figure represent  WINSTONE  That Sir represents the identical figure of a slave  who having absconded and hid himself was at length discovered brought home and severely flogged but happening to die under the lash was unfortunately for his expeditions to the woods somewhat too prematurely sent to the shades  LOVEMORE  Your anger then Sir did not pursue him after death  WINSTONE  O God Sir no He haunted my conscience for ever after he appeared at night by my bed side and in short troubled me so much that in order to appease the fellow's ghost I erected this to his honour  WHITMORE  He was a revengeful fellow though a damn'd good cooper and came from Guinea I knew him well  WINSTONE  Now the ghost of another country slave would not have troubled me but have lain quiet enough  LOVEMORE  Heaven I see has revenged the old man's severity and for a slave killed has returned him a daughter burned for a black lost a mulatto gained  WYNDHAM  It was well Sir that as you cut short the thread of his mortality you raised this bust to his fame and renown  WINSTONE  There was nothing for it but that the group of  other figures you see are pieces done from fancy white black and yellow but that which takes up Mr Lovemore's attention is the principal one  LOVEMORE  Would you be so obliging as to permit me to touch this wax for upon my soul the artificial vermillion of the lips looks so much like real balmy benign true blood that I am almost tempted to kiss them If I gaze longer like the statuarist of old I shall forget myself and fall in love with a piece of wax I will I must thou sweetest piece of artificial nature Ha  Starting back as he goes to touch it Miss Winstone oversets the pedestal and falls back into the attitude of a fencer with her fan in her right hand Mr Lovemore after expressing much surprize clasps his hands in rapture the other gentlemen seem much surprized and make a pause old Winstone resting his chin upon a cudgel  WHITMORE  Why damme Captain old Winstone deals with the devil  WYNDHAM  Yes you know his conscience was haunted before  WHITMORE  He is now like a Persian worshipping the Sun  WINSTONE  Gentlemen what is the matter  WHITMORE  How can you ask when you surprize us so Is the lady really Miss Winstone or a piece of organized wax work  WINSTONE  Go to her and see  WHITMORE  Not I faith  WYNDHAM  Nor I for I have not faith How these women love mischief she wished to surprize me I suppose because I was a soldier  Winstone his daughter and the company burst into a fit of laughter  To Lovemore  Well Sir how do you feel now  LOVEMORE  Oh Sir I cannot tell you I begin to suspect the wax figures to be all impostors  WHITMORE  And so do I We must take care what we say and keep close together  LOVEMORE  I'm afraid old Winstone means to wreck his revenge upon me and that the other figures are all bullies  LOUISA  Ha ha ha you three sneaking cowardly fellows hold up your heads and look upon me You Captain Wyndham what do you mean by profaning this place after making the unfortunate Miss Winstone the subject of your scandalous conversation and ridicule do you come here with that brown face and false heroic air of yours to endeavour once more to subdue the creature you despised  WHITMORE  It is her sure enough  WINSTONE  Well said my dear upbraid them to the purpose  LOUISA  You too Mr Whitmore what do you do here Sir Do you think with that ugly face any woman will ever adopt you even as her gallant are not you enough to frighten the God of Love blunt his arrows and be the very sport of all genuine passion  WINSTONE  Charming girl how delightfully severe she is  LOVEMORE  aside  Now comes my turn  LOUISA  You last though not least Mr Lovemore  LOVEMORE  Aye so I said though last not least in love I hope Madam  LOUISA  Last in love and first in hate Sir  LOVEMORE  Do not upbraid me Madam for if I had any idea you could have been so metamorphosed I vow and protest I would have taken more pains to have deserved your love  LOUISA  Contemptible as the evasion is I believe it and the worst that shall befall you is to be most heartily laughed at  LOVEMORE  That I have been already Madam Could not you change the punishment to running the gauntlet Regard me Madam as a poor silly fellow who came a great way on a wild goose chace who knew no better one of the fools of nature and the slave of your sex  LOUISA  Therefore the best subject for its scorn  WINSTONE  Well done my dear How charmingly she retaliates Why Mr Lovemore my daughter is severe upon you  LOVEMORE  Yes Sir if you set her on  WINSTONE  In truth Sir I do and had she not made amends for your ill manners by shooting you plump through the heart just now I was determined to have run you through the body  WHITMORE  That Sir you may do yet and I will be your second Poor Lovemore how I pity thee  LOVEMORE  Damn your pity you are always pitying me  WYNDHAM  For my part I expect to see all the other figures start into life They are all black white and yellow the natural children of old Winstone How pray Madam was the miracle wrought in your countenance  WHITMORE  Tell us Madam that we may make ourselves as lovely as you could wish  LOUISA  Lovely ha ha ha  WINSTONE  My daughter's method of regaining her complexion is kept a profound secret but you and Captain Wyndham may regain your's by the assistance of steel filings brown sand scalding hot water and a scowering brush  WYNDHAM  Why that will take the skin off  WHITMORE  The old gentleman will not tell us Wyndham for I see he means to monopolize the patent to himself  LOVEMORE  Yes he is afraid of my carrying it to England before him but it is of no consequence as it has wrought so agreeable a change in this charming lady  LOUISA  Well said Sir In England you compared me  to alabaster just now you thought me a piece of waxwork but it is the way of all mankind whatever they imagine us at first they find us mere downright flesh and blood  WYNDHAM  whispers Whitmore  Harkee have you a mind to try old Winstone's receipt  WHITMORE  What scower my face be laughed at as Lovemore has been oh no not for all the world  WYNDHAM  Shall we stay then till the patent comes out  WHITMORE  Oh by all means I would not scald my face for all the women in the Grand Signior's Seraglio  WYNDHAM  Shall we kneel down then and ask Miss Winstone's pardon for laughing at her besides she is really so wonderfully mended that my knees bend under me without hardly knowing the cause  WHITMORE  With all my heart but we must do it genteely So here goes  they both kneel  LOUISA  Oh this is rare ha ha ha  WHITMORE  We do it because we know you love rarities  LOUISA  I wish Hannah was here with all my heart but  she keeps out of the way because my triumph would make her heart ach  WINSTONE  Here is victory compleata victory too over these Come my girl let me embrace you  LOVEMORE  Why the father himself is in love with her  WYNDHAM  I wish I knew what the had done to herself to make us all such fools  LOVEMORE  It has succeeded most rarely  Miss Winstone accidentally drops her fan they all strive to pick it up but Lovemore succeeds who politely hands it to her  I Madam am the happy man  LOUISA  But a most unfortunate knighterrant  WINSTONE  They are all at loggerheads now to serve her I have absolutely a great mind to skin my face and marry the first beautiful young woman I meet for the success has been wonderful  WYNDHAM  I was sorry to hear of your indisposition Madam but am now happy to find your beauty was all that while improving  LOUISA  Yes Sir I am happy to find that my indisposition has so much improved your manners  WYNDHAM  Oh Madam it has improved us all  they all speak  LOVEMORE  Miss Winstone was just as long in the attempt as  LOUISA  As what Sir  WHITMORE  As a grub would be turning into a butterfly or the soldier crab changing his shell  LOUISA  Odious odious  WINSTONE  A devil of a comparison  WYNDHAM  Ha ha ha  LOVEMORE  One would imagine Sir by your unpoetical comparison of the grub you were imported here from Grubstreet but sweet Madam be under no uneasiness for I will protect you from all such vermin  WHITMORE  You will want my armour again for that  LOVEMORE  To Miss Winstone  Oh Madam how shall I hide my confusion or how express the sentiments of my returning passion for you Can you forgive me my past folly and once more receive a faithful  sincere penitent in a word Madam do I owe the wonderful transmigration to your affection for me  LOUISA  Affection for you ha ha ha Are you such a simpleton to think so You Mr Lovemore are the last of men who share any part of my affections  angrily  WHITMORE  Affections indeed ha ha Only hear him Wyndham he has the impudence to talk of affection  touches him on the elbow  Harkee Sir  LOVEMORE  leaning his ear  What do you say  WHITMORE  I pity you most sincerely upon my soul  LOVEMORE  Damn damn your pity Sir  stamping his feet  WYNDHAM  aside to Whitmore  How wonderfully foolish he looks upon my soul he is biting his nails his eyes wink as if he was going to cry  WHITMORE  I do not wonder at it A man never looks so foolish never so much like a hangdog as when a pretty woman refuses his suit  WYNDHAM  Aye my dear Sir I know it by experience It  is to a redcoat worse than a battleax bayonets or scalping knives  LOVEMORE  The whole island you know Madam has rung with my unfortunate my incurable passion  LOUISA  And the whole island Sir are determined to make you ring with theirs for they hold the virtue and the happiness of their families in this part of the world in such high esteem that they would not suffer either to be trampled up by any mortal upon earth though more than Briton born  WHITMORE  puts his hands akimbo  No that we will not suffer either to be trampled upon Will we Wyndham  WYNDHAM  No upon my word  LOVEMORE  So it appears by the jokes they have cracked upon me  WINSTONE  The jokes are only a prelude Sir to something more serious as gentle currents of air spread small fires into extensive conflagrations  LOVEMORE  You do not mean to burn me Sir The women could not strike with their eyes so they are determined to put me into an actual furnace at last  WINSTONE  Why don't you make the insulted lady some apology  LOVEMORE  Apology I might tell her indeed that I am sorry sorry very sorry sorry and so on  WHITMORE  taking him off  You are sorry and sorry and very sorry That's like a great booby of a schoolboy who cannot be otherwise after a severe beating  LOVEMORE  Vile reptile protect yourself  making a lounge at him with his sword in consequence of which Whitmore by endeavouring to hide behind one of the figures knocks it over and breaks it to pieces  WINSTONE  Murder my image my image death Mr Whitmore what do you mean I wish you were laid at the bottom of the sea and your friend there packed off the island  WHITMORE  taking off Lovemore  Sir I protest I am sorry sorry and very sorry  WINSTONE  Damn your compassion for it spares neither things animate or inanimate I will have a dozen of field negroes for this  WHITMORE  They shall be lazy ones then and as incapable of servitude as your image  LOVEMORE  I say Mr Winstone  WINSTONE  Damn your remonstrances Sir see what you've done  LOVEMORE  to Miss Winstone  Oh Madam whatever my past conduct has been accept my repentant vows your changed features are sufficient to warm the heart of an hermit and these added to Miss Winstone's now durable good qualities will ever enslave the heart of her poor unhappy unfortunate Lovemore  kneeling  LOUISA  aside  Lie still my heart and teach me to repay his scorn  WINSTONE  My poor image  WYNDHAM  Will not you raise him up Madam  LOUISA  Not I Sir it is too much trouble in this part of the world we require assistance and take care to let others shift for themselves  LOVEMORE  still kneeling  Will you permit me to return Madam without one kind one tender look  she turns from him with contempt Lovemore rises  I see there is nothing to be done why this then finally fixes my resolution  of going back to England What a figure I shall make when I land at Dover or Deal  WHITMORE  Aye just like a stripped smuggler for all the world  LOVEMORE  I boasted to some brother collegians that I was going to Colchis in quest of the golden fleece compared myself to Jason and the lady to Medea but I will verily go back to my old musty college take a degree forget the ladies entirely and console myself the remainder of my days with black strap and philosophy  WHITMORE  The joke though will attend you all the way it will not lose sight of you depend upon it  LOUISA  What Mr Lovemore excites your vanity on the present occasion may more probably be attributed to my own Is it not the pleasure of our sex to lead yours in chains and do not we wish for beauty more to make us generally admired than to drag one dull stupid helpmate along all one's life  WHITMORE  Certainly Madam You see Lovemore Miss Winstone is a public spirited lady she did not put herself to pain only for you but that Wyndham and myself also might be among the number of her admirers  LOUISA  to Mr Winstone  The gentlemen however are not yet sufficiently  informed on this subject of transmigration If you please Sir introduce the effeminate Mr Greville for he poor man has met with such an accident ha ha ha  LOVEMORE  He has been scowering his face I dare say  WINSTONE  Aye till he has made it shine again  Wyndham and Whitmore both laugh and ask to see him  LOUISA  Do Sir fetch him to the gentlemen  Exit Winstone and enters with Mr Greville who has his face blotched by the effects of the cushoo  WINSTONE  I had difficult work to bring him He was very stubborn  GREVILLE  I know Sir you brought me here to be laughed at and I deserve it  WYNDHAM  What hast thou been doing with that sweet pretty face of thine  LOUISA  Ha ha Harlequin touched it with his wand and turned it to the stripes of his jacket  WYNDHAM  It's like a carrion crow hung upon a barn door and bleached with the beams of the sun  LOVEMORE  Or like the last remaining dregs in the crucible of some old chymist  WINSTONE  In short gentlemen the devil put his fingers on his face and scratched it to this fashion Now you shall see the devil himself  exit Winstone  LOVEMORE  Fie fie Mr Greville how can you help it  GREVILLE  It is a misfortune gentlemen and it's cruel to laugh at me  The scrubbing brush and steel filings have taken all the skin off his face  Enter Winstone with Quacou in the same unfortunate condition  WHITMORE  Here is the devil indeed  WYNDHAM  He looks as if he had run into the woods of America and all the monkeys and baboons there had scratched him into a leprosy  LOVEMORE  As for Mr Greville I cannot help regretting that a person of your taste and refinement should have been born in this climate as in the land from whence I came instead of a cushoonut a man  by the assistance of a little brown paint mixed with a portion of vermillion would have made himself every thing charming and fashionable  GREVILLE  What a pity what a pity it is I did not know it before  WHITMORE  taking off Lovemore  Mr Lovemore Greville is sorry sorry very sorry sorry and so on It is impossible he should ever make his fortune now in the way of wedlock unless the widow of some fellow who shewed wild beasts should think fit to marry him expose him as one of the polecat kind for money and take his face by way of dower or pin money  WYNDHAM  to Miss Winstone  What has your cousin Hannah too Madam been scowering has she been improving her beauty  LOUISA  Oh yes poor girl she has been trying but all to very little purpose the sun burn and yellow jaundice together has sunk so very deep into her face that nothing under the surgeon's knife could ever possibly eradicate them thence  WHITMORE  What a desperate case  LOVEMORE  You have a new subject for pity then Whitmore  WHITMORE  But not so good as the old no you are the best subject for pity I ever saw under the sun  WYNDHAM  He wants to change the fool's cap and bell from  his own head to that of the poor lady's that is not like a true knighterrant I must say  WHITMORE  Aye that is cowardly and pitiful to a degree  LOUISA  But Mr Lovemore what if I should
