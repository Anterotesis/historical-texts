EDWINA  Mrs YATES  SABINA  Mrs COLLES  Attendants on MATILDA Guards Foresters Wardens and various Attendants  PROLOGUE  Spoken by MR HENDERSON  TO holy land in superstition's day  When bare foot pilgrims trode their weary way  By mother church's unremitting law  Scourg'd into grace with shoulders red and raw  Kneeling demure before the sacred shrine  On the hard flint th  y begg'd the boon divine  Pardon for what offending flesh had done  And pity for the long long course they'd run  Fines pains and penalties securely past  Slow pac'd forgiveness met their prayer at last  Full absolution from conceeding Rome  Cancell'd all sin past present and to come  Your Poet thus prophanely led aside  To range o'er Tragic land without a guide  To pick perhaps with no invidious aim  A few cast fallings from the tree of fame  Damn'd tho' untried by the despotic rule  Of the stern Doctors in detraction's school  Lash'd down each column of a public page  And driv'n o'er burning ploughshares to the stage  Be rhim'd be ridicul'd with doggrel wit  Sues out a pardon from his Pope  the Pit  Pensive he stands in penitential weeds  With a huge rosary of untold beads  Sentenc'd for past offences to rehearse  Ave Apollo's  to the God of verse  And sure there's no one but an Author knows  The Penance which an Author undergoes  If then your worships a few stripes award  Let not your beadles lay them on too hard  For in the world there's not a thing so thin  So full of feeling as your Poet's skin  What if perchance he snatch'd a playful kiss  From that free hearted romp the Comic Miss  That frolick's past he's turn'd to years of grace  And a young sinner now supplies his place  Sure you'll not grudge a little sober chat  With this demure old tabby Tragic cat  No charge lies here of conversation crim  He hopes you'll think her fame no worse for him  EPILOGUE  Spoken by MISS YOUNGE  FROM ancient Thespis to the present age  The world hath oft been term'd a public stage  A threadbare metaphor which in its time  Hath patch'd much prose and heelpiec'd many a rhime  Ev'n the grave pulpit sometimes  deigns  to use  The emphatic terms of the proscribed Muse  Calls birth our entry death our exit calls  And at life's close exclaimsthe curtain falls  And so concludes upon the drama's plan  That fretting strutting shorthour actor man  Are we all actors then  yes all from Adam  And actresses  I apprehend so Madam  Some fill their cast with grace others with none  Some are shov'd off the stage and some shov'd on  Some good some bad still we all act a part  Whilst we disguise the language of the heart  Nature's plain taste provides a simple treat  But art the  Cook  steps in and mars the meat  The comic blade makes ridicule his test  And on his tomb proclaims that life's a jest  The swaggering braggart in true tragic cast  Bellows blank verse and daggers to the last  Whilst clubs of neutral petitmaitres boast  A kind of opera company at most  Whose dress air action all is imitation  A poor insipid servile French translation  Whose tame dull scene glides uniform along  In comifareipastoralsingsong  'Till all awaken'd by the rattling die  Club wits and makea modern tragedy  A tragedy alas good friends look round  What have we left to tread but tragic ground  Four authors leagu'd to shake the human soul  Unsheath the dagger and infuse the bowl  At length descending to the least and last  We hope the terror of the time is past  Full sated now with battle blood and murder  England is conquer'dfate can reach no further  Bid then the weeping  Pleiads  dry their eyes  And turn to happier scenes and brighter skies  THE BATTLE of HASTINGS A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  The Outside of a stately antient Castle The Gate closed and the Bugle in the Slings  Time before Break of Day  Earl  EDWIN  enters  EDWIN  WHETHER 'tis now the secret witching hour  When the smart imps work their malignant spells  Unfriendly to man's health or that Heaven sends  These warnings these misgivings to forerun  And harbinger some strange calamity  I know not but there's something passing here  Beyond the mind's conjecture ominous  RAYMOND  speaks from the Walls    RAYMOND  Stand Who goes there  EDWIN  A friend  RAYMOND  May none but friends  Approach these gates what wakeful man art thou  Whom busy care provokes thus early forth  Ere the grey twilight glimmers in the east  EDWIN  Know'st thou not me and needs there light for that  Sounds not this voice familiar to thine ear  Or have the darkling wizzards of the night  Confounded thy clear organs Thee I know  Raymond descend and open to thy Lord  RAYMOND  My Lord my Master  He disappears  EDWIN  alone  Venerable pile  Whose plain rough features shew like honestyâ–ª  Cradle of loyalty from earliest time  Ye antique towers courts bannerbearing halls  Trophies and tombs of my renown'd forefathers  And you surrounding oaks fathers and sons  And old old grandsires chroniclers of time  By which the forest woodman marks his tale  If fate will doom you to a Norman master  Farewell ye perish in your country's fall  Raymond  comes out from the castle  RAYMOND  See Lord your castle opens wide it's arms  Your porters warders foresters shall rouse  Herald provoke the bugle spread the joy  Herald goes to sound the bugle  EDWIN  What joy forbear there is no joy for Edwin  RAYMOND  Are we then lost is Normandy victorious  EDWIN  No in the swoln and pregnant womb of fate  Lies the yet unborn hourDismiss the herald  And gently close the gate  Raymond  closes the gate  Ye who have bosoms  Unscarr'd by sharp vexation's thorny scourge  Sleep while you may 'Tis well come hither Raymond  Nay I account thee as a friendbe nearer  Pass'd all things quiet on thy watch this night  RAYMOND  All things were quiet  EDWIN  Far as well as near  Wide as thine ear could carry no rude straggler  Scowring the night no neighing at the gate  No trampling heard no talking as of parties  Met by assignment  RAYMOND  Hah in very truth  To all these questions no  EDWIN  I must believe thee  The more I'm lost in wonder but confess  At my last question wherefore didst thou start  And arch thy brow significantly speak  Thou may'st reveal thy thoughts  RAYMOND  Nay good my Lord  My thoughts are little worth  EDWIN  I see thou'rt cautious  So let it passHow fares our sister blooms  The rose of health fresh on Edwina's cheek  As it was wont  RAYMOND  It brightens as it blows  EDWIN  Yes Raymond she is fair Heaven for the sins  Of this offending country made her fair  Oh I had treasur'd up such thoughtsBut mark  Edmund the youth whom I have father'd he  Who in the beating surge of black despair  But for my saving arm had sunk outright  And perish'd fathoms deep last night i'th' camp  Soon as the guard had gone it's stated round  Vaulted the trench like Perseus on his steed  Then fled as if he'd overtake the wind  Whither heav'n knows  RAYMOND  Fled death to honour fled  EDWIN  Fled at this glorious crisis Oh it cuts  My heart's best hope asunder  RAYMOND  Heavenly vengeance  O'ertake and strike him  EDWIN  PeaceYou must not curse him  RAYMOND  Hah wherefore not  EDWIN  Becauseexpect a wonder  Because he is thy king  RAYMOND  Uphold me heaven  EDWIN  Mine and thy king of Alfred's line a king  Edgar call'd Atheling the rightful lord  Of this ingrateful realm which Kentish Harold  Audaciously usurps  RAYMOND  What do I hear  Alas I thought him poor an orphan youth  The child of hard misfortune  EDWIN  Think so still  Or keep these thoughts untold  RAYMOND  Had I known this  I wou'd have serv'd him hourly on my knees  O noble sir direct me where to seek him  How to restore him to these peaceful shades  EDWIN  Not for the world no if we meet again  Back to the English camp he shall repair  The scene of all his hopes Oh such a form  Of majesty with youthful beauty grac'd  He was the soldier's idol such a spirit  Beam'd from his eyes his presence like the sun  Gladden'd beholders hearts  RAYMOND  I have a mistress  A young and beauteous lady  EDWIN  Name her not  The source of all my shame Shall it be said  That Edwin rais'd his sovereign to the throne  Only to place a sister at his side  Perish the thought Now learn a mighty secret  Matilda loves him Harold's matchless daughter  Loves Edgar Atheling her dower a kingdom  Therefore no talk of Edmund and Edwina  They meet no more Now Raymond had I lodg'd  My secret in a light and leaky bosom  Better my sword shou'd rip it up at once  And take it back againBut thou art honest  RAYMOND  You were not wont to doubt me  EDWIN  Nay I will not  Hah what is this who bade this music forth  Clarinets at a distance  RAYMOND  My lord I know not  EDWIN  Whence proceeds it Mark  RAYMOND  If my ear fail not from the beachen grove  West of king Alfred's tower  EDWIN  Lead to the place  Exeunt  Edgar enters with foresters bearing clarinets  EDGAR  Now breathe a strain if your rude stops will let you  Soft as a lover's sighNay you're too loud  Mark where you've rous'd the gentle sleeping deer  Fellows begone awayEdwina  Edwina appears at a window  EDWINA  Edmund  Oh I have suffer'd a long age of absence  EDGAR  Come then and make these few short moments blest  EDWINA  How shall I come Tear down these iron bars  And leap into thine arms What shall I do  EDGAR  Goes to the castle gate and discovers it to be open  By all my hopes the castle gate is open  Descend be swift  EDWINA  As thine own thoughts  She disappears  EDGAR  alone  O Love  Small elf who by the glowworm's twinkling light  Fine fairyfinger'd child can'st slip the bolt  While the cramm'd warden snores this is thy doing  Lo where she comes so breaks the morning forth  Blushing and breathing odours  Edwina appears  O thou trembler  Rest on my faithful bosom fairest tell me  Still dost thou love speak is thine Edmund welcome  EDWINA  Is the sun welcome to the wakeful eyes  Of the wreckt mariner when o'er the waves  The longexpected dayspring of his hope  Mounts in the worshipt eastBut why comes Edmund  Thus wrapt in darkness at this secret hour  As to a guilty meeting  EDGAR  'Tis the hour  Sacred to love and me ere noisy labour  Wakens the sun while yet the fairy elves  Dance in their dewy rounds the silent hour  Before the lark her shrillton'd matins sings  Or morning issues from the nuptial east  And to the bosoms of the nursing hours  The newborn day commits It is the hour  When every flying minute should be wafted  Back to the skies on downy wings of love  EDWINA  Away your words affright me you consort  With mad ambition Edmund and your love  So gentle once is like the wars you follow  Fiery and fierce  EDGAR  Instruct me in thy wishes  Tell me what love shou'd be  EDWINA  Love shou'd be pure  Harmless as pilgrims kisses on the shrines  Of virgin martyrs holy as the thoughts  Of dying saints when angels hover o'er them  Harmonious gentle soft such love shou'd be  The zephyr not the whirlwind of the soul  EDGAR  Yes but my love like neverending time  Will neither be determin'd nor describ'd  The poet by the magic of his song  Can charm the list'ning moon ascend the spheres  And in his airy and extravagant flight  Belt wide creation's round yet can he never  Invent that form of words to speak my passion  EDWINA  If such your passion why this secret meeting  Why talk of silent hours Let earth and heaven  Look on and witness to your love so truth  So nature speaks I know no other language  EDGAR  Oh that the throne of this proud realm were mine  That I might say before the applauding world  Ascend my lovely bride and be a queen  EDWINA  A queen what idle dreams perplex thy fancy  Are there no blessings for the poor and humble  EDGAR  Yes but a brother's curse  EDWINA  A brother's curse  Doth he not love thee wait upon thee hourly  Talk of thee ever bend down his proud spirit  Ev'n to a vassal's homage Nay by heav'n  With an idolatry of soul he loves thee  And shall he not applaud me for my choice  EDGAR  He will renounce thee hate thee for thy choice  EDWINA  Away I'll not believe it hate renounce  It cannot be hence with this dark reserve  If thou know'staught which honour shou'd unfold  I do conjure thee speak tho' late confess  EDGAR  By heav'n thy brother    EDWIN  enters hastily  EDWIN  Are you found young sir  O shame shame shame Is this the friend the hero  Have I deserv'd this from you  EDGAR  If to love  The best the fairest of her sex is base  Vile and ingrateful if it be a sin  Morning and eve to name her in my prayers  I am of all most guilty  EDWIN  You abuse  The weakness of a fond unguarded orphan  Parlying in secret by the moon's pale beam  The tenderest flower that withers at the breeze  Or if the amorous sun but steal a kiss  Drops its soft head and dies is not more frail  Than maiden reputation 'tis a mirror  Which the first sigh defiles  EDGAR  Look at that form  With all thy cold philosophy survey it  And wonder if thou can'st why I adore  EDWIN  Away nor vex my too too patient spirit  With this fond rhapsody Hence and to horse  Buckle afresh your glittering armour on  For England not Edwina now demands you  By your thriceplighted oath I do conjure you  By all the world calls honest by your hopes  Come to the camp if you return not with me  The sun which rises yonder in the East  Goes not more surely to his ev'ning grave  Than I to mine  EDGAR  Lo I obey your summons  Fierce flinty warrior in yond beachen grove  Stands my caparison'd and ready steed  There on the trunk whose living bark records  My lov'd Edwina's name hangs up my sword  My mailed corslet and my plumed crest  With all the proud apparel of the war  When I am furnish'd I shall court admittance  To this fair presence and implore a smile  As my last parting boon which if obtain'd  Nor spells nor talismans shall be so potent  To shield my bosom in the bleeding field  As the sweet magic of Edwina's eyes  EDWINA  If thou hast love or pity in thy soul  Return and tell the rest  EDGAR  O death to part  Exit  EDWINA  Now stern admonisher I see my fate  And I will bear it with what grace I can  Not lightly as philosophers prescribe  To others when themselves are well at ease  But deeply feelingly as one shou'd do  Whose heart by nature and by love made soft  With sorrow and unkindness now is rent  EDWIN  You love and you avow itrighteous heav'n  What is there in the scope of human means  Which my providing foresight hath not summon'd  To fence off this destruction Lost Edwina  Hath not thy brother like a faithful pilot  Sounded this dang'rous coast where rocks and shallows  Wait for the wreck of honour's costly freight  Have I not pointed to the baneful quarter  Whence cold and blasting disappointment blows  Withering thy beauty's bloom  EDWINA  Thou hast my brother  Thou hast done all that man cou'd do to save me  But heav'n is over all  EDWIN  When last we parted  Thou helpless orphan what was then my caution  EDWINA  You caution'd me against unwary love  You warn'd me how I listen'd how I look'd  'Twas a vain warning I had look'd and listen'd  And whilst I open'd my weak heart to pity  I let in love withal  EDWIN  You let in madness  EDWINA  Did you not pity I have seen your eyes  Unus'd to weep turn fountains as they gaz'd  Did you not love Your very soul was Edmund's  I know you'll call it friendship so did I  But find too late 'twas love  EDWIN  Call it despair  For hope it must be never call it death  Sure some malignant planet rul'd thy birth  And thou art doom'd to nothing but disaster  Three nights and days thy widow'd mother travail'd  With fruitless pangs the fourth succeeding morn  She blest her newborn murderer and expir'd  Then as 'tis said my father's shade did walk  Then on the western tower the ominous owl  Scream'd at midday the faithless misletoe  From its maternal oak untwin'd its arms  And dropt without a blast  EDWINA  No more but strike  Mine is the crime to be belov'd by Edmund  Draw forth thy sword and strike it to my heart  That rebel heart which will not be commanded  But spite of death and Edwin dares to love  Why dost thou pause  EDWIN  Strike to thy heart O horror  Not if an angel visibly descended  And bade me give the blow  EDWINA  Wilt thou not kill me  EDWIN  By heav'n I wou'd not harm thee to be Lord  Of sea and earth  EDWINA  Then take me to thine arms  For still thou lov'st me still thou art my brother  Embracing  EDWIN  I am thy brother still and hold thy love  Dearer than relicks of departed saints  Richer than hoarded piles of worshipt gold  Come then and seek content in some calm dwelling  Some silent convent from the world withdrawn  Where pray'r and penance make atonement sure  Where meditation communing with heaven  Shall sooth the rebel passions into peace  Refine the soul and conquer love itself  EDWINA  Talk not of cells and convents I am Edmund's  EDWIN  Thou must forget the very name of Edmund  EDWINA  His very name why for what cause declare  EDWIN  There is a cause a cause approv'd by heav'n  And crown'd with deathless glory Search no further  This hour he parts return thou to thy rest  When next  e meet thou shalt applaud and thank me  Go go EdwinanayIt must be so  Exit  EDWINA  alone  Why then it shall be so Let him to battle  Tear us asunderI can only die  When I am gone his fame shall be immortal  So when the bleak and wintry tempest rends  The mantling ivy from the worshipt sides  Of some aspiring tower where late it hung  The stately mass as with a sullen scorn  From its proud height looks down upon the wreck  And disencumber'd from its feeble guest  Bares its broad bosom and defies the storm  EDGAR  enters arm'd as for battle  EDGAR  Alone O happy chance at thy fond bidding  Obedient I return  EDWINA  Hah what art thou  EDGAR  Dost thou not know me Am I not thine Edmund  EDWINA  Away 'tis lostI must forget that name  EDGAR  Coin what new name thou wilt Let me be any thing  So 'tis but what you love I shall be happy  EDWINA  Are these the soft habiliments of love  This high proud plumage these bloodstained arms  Go to the mistress whom you serve Ambition  And talk no more of love  EDGAR  By heav'n I love thee  More than the sunburnt earth loves soft'ning showers  More than newransom'd captives love the day  Or dying martyrs breathing forth their souls  The acclamations of whole hosts of angels  EDWINA  Why then leaves Edmund what so well he loves  EDGAR  But to return more worthy of that love  Can I oh tell me can thine Edmund sleep  In these calm haunts whilst war's insulting shout  Fills the wide cope of heav'n and every blast  That thro' this solitary forest howls  Wafts to my ear my country's dying groans  EDWINA  If groans can move thee why so deaf to mine  Mysterious youth or now at once resolve me  Or now for ever go Who and what art thou  Why does my brother wrest thee from my sight  And why with that stern brow am I commanded  Vain fruitless mandate to forget my Edmund  Forget thy very name and that dear hour  When first he brought thee to these happy scenes  What tender charges did he then impose  How did his tongue run over in thy praise  'Till honouring Edmund for a brother's sake  I soon perceiv'd I lov'd him for his own  EDGAR  Oh there is such persuasion in thy looks  I shall forget myself and tell thee all  EDWINA  'Twas then that Edwin told us thou wast sprung  From the best blood which England's Isle cou'd boast  He said that thou wast Edgar's nearest friend  That with his crown thy fortunes had been lost  Bade us revere thee love thee as the king  For that so close an union knit your souls  Edgar and thou were one  EDGAR  And truth he told  For I am Edgar I am England's king  EDWINA  King thou the king  EDGAR  Be constantI am Edgar  EDWINA  After a pause she sinks slowly on her knees  The heavens confirm your right and build your fortune  To its deserved greatness on my knees  I beg a blessing on you but for pity  Mock me no more it is not noble in you  And tortures my poor heart  EDGAR  Hear me Edwina  EDWINA  Fly me disown me leave me to my fate  EDGAR  No by this fond embrace I swear to live  For thee alone when I forsake Edwina  Let me chronicled to latest ages  For vile and falseRemember'd in thy prayers  As with impenetrable armour fenc'd  Fearless I part fairest and best farewel  May each good spirit of the night and day  Watch round thee hourlyEngland and Edwina  End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  The English Camp The royal Tent with the Banners of Harold unfurl'd  EDGAR  and  EDWIN  EDWIN  EDMUND your steed is featherfooted light  As gossamour and you methinks did ride  As you'd o'ertake the couriers of the sky  Hors'd on the sightless winds The camp yet sleeps  We have outstript the hour  EDGAR  Mark Edwin mark  How lovingly the strumpet winds salute  These slanting banners of the Earl of Kent  Teach me some patienceO ye ministring storms  Where did you sleep while usurpation grew  To this proud height  EDWIN  No more remember Sir  You are a subject here  EDGAR  King Edmund's heir  Can he be subject to Earl Goodwyn's son  If thou wouldst teach that lesson sluice these veins  And let out Alfred's blood  EDWIN  You are too loud  Here comes Northumberland a fiery spirit  Which fourscore winters have not yet extinguisht  I pray you though he be your house's foe  Bear yourself gently tow'rds him 'twill be wisdom  Enter  NORTHUMBERLAND SIFFRIC WALTHEOF  and others  NORTHUMBERLAND  The king not forth yet Oh it is the soul  Of discipline to harness with the sun  Can'st thou not Siffric call to mind the day  When with a handful of Northumbrian kerns  I foil'd the king of Scots on Tweda's brink  SIFFRIC  'Twas on Saint Jude betimes  NORTHUMBERLAND  The greyey'd morn  Laugh'd to behold the vaunting sluggard fly  As we did hollow him with hunter's cries  Back to his native wilds Soft who are these  The faction of young Edgar Said you not  These men had fled the campBut see where comes  Mercia the princely brother of our king  Earl of  MERCIA  with attendants  MERCIA  Warriors well met health and a happy morn  And may the sun which dances on your plumes  Still with new glories gild your conqu'ring brows  The king not yet abroad still on his knees  For his dear people's sakeHow wears the day  NORTHUMBERLAND  Prince till our royal leader shall come forth  There is no day Let him once found to battle  On piles of Norman slain we'll build him altars  High as Olympus in the battle's shout  We'll chant our morning oraisons so loud  That heav'ns high vault shall echoe with the peal  EDGAR  How valianttongu'd we are heav'ns favor guard us  And keep off the old adage  EDWIN  Be more patient  And let his humour pass  EDGAR  Hang him vain dotard  I sicken at his folly  EDWIN  See the King  The curtain of the tent is suddenly drawn off and King  Harold  appears He comes forward  KING  Nobles all hail O sight of joyful hope  For suffering England patriot band of worthies  Confederate by the holiest league on earth  To the best dearest cause How say you friends  Stand your hearts with us for immediate battle  Do they all beat to the same martial measure  And shall we forth at once  NORTHUMBERLAND  Forth Strike the drums  Seize your bright spears my gallant countrymen  And let us drive these hungry wolves before us  Home to their howling forests  KING  Valiant chiefs  You hear Northumberland renown'd in arms  Is there amongst us one who wou'd incline  To measures of more caution  SIFFRIC  My dread Leige  Well hath Northumberland advis'd for battle  Of friends of fame abandon'd be the man  Who checks the warrior's ardour and imposes  Vile coward fears beneath the mask of caution  EDWIN  I must confess my reason is not caught  By empty sounds nor can I give my voice  For rash intemperate and immediate battle  The foe dread Sir is sixty thousand strong  By hardy warriors led and train'd in arms  Snatch your bright spears cries bold Northumberland  And chace these wolvesAlas these wolves have fangs  And will not fly for words  NORTHUMBERLAND  Now by my life  Edwin thy heart is not with England's cause  EDGAR  Not with his country's cause Northumberlandâ–ª  Wert thou as great as pagan Hercules  And I no better than thyself old man  Ev'n such a wither'd palsied thing as thou art  Yet wou'd I tell thee to thy teeth 'tis false  As wide as lowest hell stands off from heav'n  So do thy words from truth  SIFFRIC  Who talks of truth  Where was your truth last night when like a spy  Darkling alone and as you hop'd unseen  You leapt the trench and fled  EDGAR  Set out the lists  Life against life then see if I can fly  Thou dastardly reviler  KING  Peace and hear me  Why hast thou left our camp where and with whom  Didst thou consume the night  EDGAR  Are there no hours  Amidst a soldier's life sacred to love  To friendship to repose I am no traitor  Nor this my noble friend let it suffice  I come a voluntary friend to claim  The privilege of my progenitors  And die for England  NORTHUMBERLAND  Perish he who would not  This is the friend my liege of outlaw'd Edgar  Of whom report prevails that he now harbours  Somewhere within this realm let him be question'd  KING  Not for another empire O Northumberland  By gentle habits let us draw mens hearts  And bind them to us not enforcedly  But lovingly and freelyHark our trumpet  Welcome brave Reginald what says the Norman  To our defiance  REGINALD  enters    REGINALD  Thus he bids me say  Tomorrow with the sun he will expect you  Army 'gainst army on the plains of Hastings  KING  Hear ye this lords Oh turn upon the foe  Those eyes that interchange their angry fires  Shall it be so brave friends What says Lord Edmund  EDGAR  There is my gage Tomorrow be our witness  Who ventures fairest in his country's cause  Edmund or Siffric  EDWIN  When we're call'd to arms  For England's safety private feuds shou'd cease  And every son unite in her defence  KING  Oh let us bring one heart to this great cause  Thus banded who shall break us To your posts  As friends and soldiers let dissension die  Learn silence of the foe and keep good watch  So farewel allEdmund  Exeunt lords  EDGAR  What wills the King  KING  Stand at my side Wou'd thou cou'dst love me Edmund  As well as thou lov'st Edgar Why dost eye me  As thou wou'dst measure me from heel to head  I never did thee wrong If thou hast sorrows  Give them to me I'm loaded hard with cares  For I'm a King thine is a private lot  Thou may'st be free and happy Gallant Earl  Wilt thou commit thy noble charge to me  I wou'd be private with him  EDWIN  Royal sir  The interest I have in him is thine  Edmund remember  KING  Follow me  EDWIN  Beware  Exeunt King and Edgar  As  EDWIN  is going out Lord  WALTHEOF  who had waited in the back scene calls to him  WALTHEOF  Turn noble Edwin look upon a friend  EDWIN  A friend Lord Waltheof  WALTHEOF  Have you then forgot  How oft in early youth on Avon's banks  We wak'd the echoes with our rural sports  Have you forgot our mutual binding oath  To royal Edgar's cause Ev'n now my heart  True to its former fires expanded swells  And labours with a second birth of love  EDWIN  Where was your oath on that lamented day  When Severn's stream ran purple with the blood  Of Edgar's murder'd friends Where was your love  When at the side of stern Northumberland  You frown'd defiance at me Art thou not  The veriest courtier that ere pag'd the heels  Of prideswoln majesty  WALTHEOF  Were I the wretch  So supple to ambition's sordid use  So abject as thou mak'st me what forbids  But I shou'd seize the lucky instant fly  To the abus'd ear of the king and tell him  EDWIN  What wou'd'st thou tell him  WALTHEOF  What that Edmund is  But for the world's worth I'll not damn my honour  Live Edgar but till Waltheof shall betray him  And he must be immortal  EDWIN  Art thou faithful  May I believe thee Oh if thou betray'st him  Hell hath not torments dire enough to plague thee  WALTHEOF  Come I am in thy bosomLearn a truth  This young Minerva whom our English Jove  Leads to his warsMatildashall be Edgar's  EDWIN  Come to my heart I do believe thee loyal  And noble as I've known thee  WALTHEOF  Why she loves him  To fascination  EDWIN  Art thou sure of that  WALTHEOF  Have I sight hearing do I live and wake  Her very soul is Edmund's  EDWIN  Grant she loves  Can we be sure that he returns her love  WALTHEOF  Does the sun warm the bosom that he shines on  So must her beauty Edgar Mark my project  The king to superstition much inclines  Peering in musty prophecies and fables  Consulting with astrologers and seers  Diviners and interpreters of dreams  Omens and prodigies  EDWIN  'Tis ever thus  When the mind's ill at ease  WALTHEOF  There is at hand  An ancient soothsayer of Scottish birth  Duncan his name ev'n such a man so white  And reverend with age as might impose  Credulity upon the wariest him  By the enthusiastic monarch deem'd  Oracular will I dispose to speak  Of Edgar and his right  EDWIN  Break off behold  The princess comes  WALTHEOF  Look Edwin what a form  Of pensive majesty Mark'd you that sigh  Those eyes love's oracles Poor stricken deer  The shaft is in thy heart  EDWIN  Let us withdraw  Exeunt  MATILDA  with her Attendants A Guard  MATILDA  Soldier retire your charge extends no further  Sabina  The Guard goes off  SABINA  What commands my gracious lady  MATILDA  You told me on the way you had a suit  What can my faithful handmaids ask in vain  SABINA  'Tis for a stranger not ourselves we ask  A virgin suitor of no vulgar mein  But fair in speech and feature one who bears  The port and semblance of illustrious birth  Tho' sorrowstruck and waining with despair  MATILDA  Have you denied her aught ah if you haveâ–ª  Or but demurr'd me and yourselves you've wrong'd  And forfeited heav'n's love What is her suit  SABINA  In these rude times protection and admission  Into our happy number  MATILDA  Bring her to us  Exeunt all but Sabina  Sabina stay there's pity in thine eyes  If this poor stranger can provoke these drops  My griefs will drown thee quite  SABINA  Alas what woud'st thou  MATILDA  What would I be the poorest thing on earth  Poorer than her whose miseries you weep for  Be any thing so I were free withal  Then might I see him wait upon him watch  And pay him hourly worship On our way  As I did meet the king and bent my knee  As is my morning custom why Sabina  When I discover'd standing at his side  Young Edmund's bright and blooming form before me  Why did my heart as with a sudden leap  Spring to my trembling lips and stop my tongue  That wou'd have beg'd a blessing Every sense  Revolted from its office my rapt soul  Fled at my eyes I fainted sunk and fell  SABINA  Ah fatal chance that ever you shou'd see him  MATILDA  Deeper and deeper sinks the mortal shaft  My bosom's peace is lost Once I was happy  Clear and serene my life's calm current ran  While scarce a breezy wish provok'd its tide  Down the smooth flood the tuneful passions fell  In easy lapse and slumber'd as they pass'd  Now what a change is wrought O love in age  Thou art indeed a child in power a God  How now What stranger's this  EDWINA  enters introduced by the Ladies of  MATILDA  's train  SABINA  You have forgot  The maid we spoke of  MATILDA  Pray you pardon me  Stranger approach and fear not I can see  Thou art not us'd to ask and yet thy looks  Plead most enforcingly If thou dost need  Such shelter as these humble coverings give  Here in the rear of danger thou may'st dwell  And join thy prayers to our's  EDWINA  Thanks noble lady  In yon fair vale while peace was there I dwelt  One only brother chear'd my orphan state  And rich in flocks and herds serene we liv'd  Him the support and solace of my life  Stern duty's iron hand hath wrested from me  And somewhere in this mighty camp he wars  What was for me deserted and forlorn  With one old faithful servant forth I came  Led slowly on thro' unfrequented paths  To her whose fame is bruited thro' the land  Whose gentleness and pity climb heav'n's court  Like an accepted sacrifice  MATILDA  No more  Praise undeserv'd what is it but reproach  This maid wou'd seem less noble than she is  Aside  How must I call thee stranger  EDWINA  Athelina  O heav'nly god of truth be not extreme  With thine offending creature but accept  Necessity my plea  Aside  MATILDA  Fair Athelina  Such welcome as these angry times allow  Freely thou hast Ours is no life of ease  We must awake before the morning dawn  Or look to have our slumbers broke tomorrow  When these vast armies which thou fee'st shall join  Rending heav'n's concave with their rival shouts  In terrible confliction  EDWINA  Power supreme  Whose word can bid the gathering clouds disperse  Smooth the vext bosom of the furrow'd sea  And chain the stubborn and contentious winds  When they unseat the everlasting rocks  And cast them to the sky wilt thou permit  Thy creature man thus to deface thy works  Or is he stronger and in less controul  Than these fierce elements  MATILDA  Banish complaint  Take hope into thy heart and every thought  Drive far away that can infect the mind  With fear's unnerved ague 'Tis the cause  The cause which sanctifies the warrior's zeal  It is our country's just maternal claim  On all her sons to fight in her defence  EDWINA  I will not whisper to the babbling winds  My illtim'd fears but hush them in my breast  And smile on sorrow tho' my sad heart break  MATILDA  Ah am not I a woman like thyself  Doth thy heart tremble for a brother's life  And shall a father's plant no cares in mine  What hast thou more at stake unless perchance  Thy flocks and herds in yon sequester'd vale  Thy peaceful calm content outweighs a crown  EDWINA  Ah Edmund Edmund why did'st thou forsake me  MATILDA  Whom dost thou name  EDWINA  I pray you pardon me  The sad remembrance of an absent friend  Drew after it a short unheeded sigh  The last which I will utter  MATILDA  Much I fear  Thou hast untold afflictions secret griefs  Which swell that bosom and provoke those sighs  But come thy tender frame demands repose  And these kind friends will lead thee to their tents  Tomorrow virgins we must teach our throats  A loftier strain and to the sounding harp  With songs of victory hail the rising morn  End of the Second Act  ACT III SCENE I  Scene as before  EDWIN  and  WALTHEOF  WALTHEOF  LO he hath dropt the curtain of his tent  Which tokens privacy Duncan is there  I have arm'd the fiery zealot for the charge  With all the stars of heaven at his command  To rouse the sleeping conscience of the king  That done my turn succeeds to mount the breach  Where superstition enter'd whelm his soul  With Edgar's wrongs and then 'twixt hope and fear  Fix this fair project  EDWIN  Oh beware Lord Waltheof  In Edgar's veins runs the last hallow'd stream  Of royal Alfred's blood  WALTHEOF  What can defeat us  Matilda's passion makes our purpose sure  And for the Kingbut hark he's coming forth  Exeunt  DUNCAN  comes hastily out of the tent followed by the King  KING  Stay Duncan stay  DUNCAN  Let me come forth  KING  Oh speak  Oh answer me this once prophetic Seer  Shall we go forth and conquer  DUNCAN  Man of sin  Conquer thyself take arms against ambition  Drive that invader from thy heart then talk  Of setting England free  KING  What is my sin  DUNCAN  And dost thou ask was it a trivial thing  From this fair vineyard to thrust out the heir  And rule by spoil and rapine  KING  I have sinn'd  Yet I've not slain him still young Edgar lives  DUNCAN  Lives he and dost thou reign Tho' thou shou'dst bribe  Legions of holy men to weary Heaven  Early and late with neverceasing prayers  Vain were their suit Now mark meAll night long  From setting to the rising sun I watcht  And on my aged knees put up loud prayers  And frequent for this hapless country's sake  HAROLD  Heav'n grant thy prayers say what declare the signs  DUNCAN  Ev'n in that moment when the midnight sphere  Central was pois'd and yesterday expir'd  On the left shoulder of the northern bear  Thy natal star arose rayless and dim  And watery pale the horoscope appear'd  While from the threat'ning East the hostile Moon  Push'd thee with adverse horns redmailed Mars  Flam'd in his planetary house and scoul'd  With stellar rage askaunt  KING  Disastrous signs  What shall I do  DUNCAN  Repent  KING  With heart abash'd  And low as to the dust I bow my head  To heav'n's rebuke and thineWhat more Oh speak  DUNCAN  "Fight not till Edgar's found"  KING  Till Edgar's found  But when and where proceed  DUNCAN  "Thou hast a daughter"  I can no more Who follows shall expound  What he shall counsel that pursue and prosper  Exit Duncan  KING  alone  Fight not till Edgar's foundSo much is perfect  Thou hast a daughterthere the prophet ceas'd  Who follows shall expoundThus I am left  This is thy fruit Ambition thus it seems  Possessions by ill deeds obtain'd by worse  Must be upheld or lost such league and concord  T  ngs vicious hold that trespassing in one  We must offend in all woe then to him  Who from his neighbour's heap purloins a grain  Yea but one grain with such swift consequence  Crime follows crime that none shall dare to say  This and no more  WALTHEOF  enters unobserv'd by  HAROLD  WALTHEOF  Thus Israel's monarch stood  With eyes so wedded to the pensive earth  When at the fable's close his conscience smote him  While the stern messenger of God pronounc'd  Thou art the man  KING  Waltheof  WALTHEOF  What wou'd my liege  KING  Approach in truth thou'rt welcome I have seen  The old divining hermit whom we met  Upon the eve of Standford's bloody day  When Halfager with his Norwegian bands  And traitrous Tosti fell beneath our swords  WALTHEOF  And gives he victory still  KING  Atonement now  Is all his theme and penitence for wrongs  To Edgar done  WALTHEOF  Hence with such idle dreamers  What are the visions of the cloyster'd monk  The hermit's phrensy or the coward calls  Of backning Conscience to ambition's charms  KING  Ambition's charms Accursed be the hour  When first they caught my weak unwary heart  Full in my view the stately phantom stood  Her stature charm'd me and the dazling height  Fir'd my young blood I sprung to her embrace  The distance vanish'd and the steep ascent  Sunk at the touch she with dissembling smiles  And meretricious glances met my joys  Upon my head she plac'd a kingly crown  But in the moment drew a ponyard forth  And plung'd it in my heart  WALTHEOF  Ah who shall envy  Another's greatness call another blest  When thus a king complains  KING  I tell thee Waltheof  Had I the world at will I'd yield it up  To be at peace with heav'n  WALTHEOF  Alas my liege  Are there no gentler terms of peace with heav'n  Methinksbut I offend perhaps and press  On too high matters  KING  I conjure thee speak  My doom is on thy lips 'tis thou alone  That can'st expound my fate  WALTHEOF  Wou'dst thou atone  For wrongs to Edgar done and purge thy soul  From it's contracted guilt Thou hast  KING  Proceed  Nor rack me with suspense  WALTHEOF  Thou hast a daughter  KING  What follows there the prophet ceas'd proceed  WALTHEOF  And need I add the rest EdgarMatilda  How those soft names unite there's music in them  Might make the angriest star in heav'n propitious  KING  Join them espouse themis it thus you counsel  WALTHEOF  If thus it please thee think it else a sound  Which dies and is forgot  KING  Come to my bosom  Thy voice to me is as the voice of heaven  It shall be so Edgar shall wed Matilda  My darling child sure will obey and bless me  Men's hearts shall be mine own these factious lords  Will all come in  WALTHEOF  Duncan shall chide no more  KING  My country shall be sav'dbut where is Edgar  Now by the virgin mother of our Lord  A bow shall not be bent against the foe  Nor a stone vollied from the slinger's arm  'Till Edgar shall be found  WALTHEOF  Then ere the star  Of evening shall arise expect him here  KING  May I believe thee  WALTHEOF  If I bring him not  Let my head answer  KING  I am whole again  Now I have divination on my side  Fight not the prophet cried 'till Edgar's found  Lo he is found I may both fight and conquer  O Waltheof I do surely think that God  To wise and holy men sometimes reveals  A portion of his councils Here we part  I to Matilda you in search of Edgar  Whom if you bring I live but to reward you  Exit  WALTHEOF  alone  Thus do I ever make all men mine own  And still conforming to these changeful times  Like ancient Janus doublefac'd at once  Follow the setting meet the rising sun  Earl  EDWIN  enters  Welcome brave lord rais'd by the fairest hand  In England's Isle your prince ascends the throne  Harold by Duncan's holy arts prepar'd  With greedy joy adopts the royal youth  EDWIN  Thanks pow'rful superstition this atones  For all the mischief thou hast wrought on earth  WALTHEOF  Now in this awful interim whilst dread  And trembling expectation hangs on all  Oh let us bring the light of England forth  So shines the daystar out after rude storms  Have shook the palsied night and high in air  Hangs forth his glittering lamp to chear the world  At sight whereof the guilty waves subside  And the vext spirits of the deep disperse  EDWIN  Would'st thou disclose the prince  WALTHEOF  Else all is lost  Vain is our hope our reconcilement void  The battle's lost and England is no more  EDWIN  Let me reflectSuppose that I reveal'd  His passion for Edwina  Aside  WALTHEOF  Doubt not Edwin  Nor for an empty scruple cast away  This sacred moment upon which depends  All that is dear our king's our country's fate  Fame virtue freedom all that we esteem  Beneath the skies all we expect above  EDWIN  Go to thy charge O Waltheof I commit  The fate of Edgar and of England Go  Yet stayresolve me hast thou weigh'd the danger  Hast thou with wary eye lookt thro' the heart  Of this ambitious man Art thou right sure  There's no dissimulation lurking there  Swear to me this as thou hast hope in heaven  And I will yield the prince  WALTHEOF  So heaven to me  Its loving mercy deal as I believe  In very truth there's not on earth that thing  Of Harold so desir'd as this alliance  EDWIN  Go then ere I recall the word begone  Tell the usurperbut thy own discretion  Will tutor thee more wiselyHence 'tis past  Exit Waltheof  EDGAR  enters hastily  EDGAR  Edwin thou'st been conferring with lord Waltheof  That man hath eyes which penetrate the heart  And he of all our English nobles here  Knows me for Edgar make him then thine own  Print on his lips the seal of holy faith  And keep my name sacred as heav'n's own records  Lockt in thy breast  EDWIN  Prince dost thou love thy country  Wou'd'st thou preserve her matrons from dishonor  Her youth from slavish bonds and chace these spoilers  From her affrighted shore  EDGAR  Wou'd I just heav'n  Thou know'st what I have done and thou can'st tell  What more that spirit thou hast giv'n wou'd do  EDWIN  Nay 'tis no irksome task No toil no danger  But joy and love and glory crown the deed  EDGAR  No more but to the point  EDWIN  In one plain word  Thus then I open all thy fateMatilda  Nay start not Sirthy tried and loving servant  Edwin thy ever faithful creature tells thee  That thou must wed Matilda  EDGAR  Hah must wed  What if I love her not  EDWIN  All men must love her  EDGAR  Must wed must love Away Did the great master  Put in thy hand those fine and secret springs  Which guide the various movements of the soul  Rouse it to hate or melt it into love  No there is that in every human breast  Which heav'n made free and tyrants cannot reach  EDWIN  Wilt thou not meet the hand that lifts thee up  From low despair and seats thee on a throne  EDGAR  Perish ambition perish every hope  Rather than this should be  EDWIN  Go then ye sons  Of freedom go your sacred birthright fell  To Norman masters hence like scatter'd sheep  Without a shepherd for there's none to watch  But hirelings he the master of the flock  Shrinks from his duty and forsakes the fold  EDGAR  Edwin this patriot rage becomes thee well  But let me glory in my choice the crown  Nay was it mine the world wou'd be Edwina's  And know I'd rather be the roving kern  That prints Arabia's sands with burning feet  And send my heart amidst the tawny tribes  To fix where love shou'd point than be a king  To wed as sordid policy prescribes  Exit  EDWIN  alone  Death to my hopes he has no soul for empire  Heav'ns that a man born for a nation's glory  Can sell his birthright at so vile a price  For such a toy as beautyO Edwina  And must I call thee sister fatal syren  Thou hast done this If Waltheof sees the King  Edgar is lost that that must be prevented  With my best speed for oh I love him still  Still my heart tells me I wou'd die to save him  Exit  MATILDA  and  EDWINA  MATILDA  A little further yetI see you wonder  Why I have brought you to this place apart  It is because a sympathy of soul  Draws and unites me to you 'tis because  There sits a weeping cherub in your eyes  That silently demands why I am sad  And I must speak to it The worldlywise  Who slowly climb by cold degrees to friendship  Such are my scorn at sight of Athelina  Affection from my breast sprung forth at once  Mature as Pallas from the brain of Jove  EDWINA  Your bounty like the sun warms where it shines  And what it feels inspires  MATILDA  O Athelina  I am ordain'd to misery soulenslav'd  And sentenc'd sore against the heart's protest  To wed and be a wretch  EDWINA  And who compels  Matilda victimlike what tyrant drags thee  As to a pagan altar there to offer  Constrain'd obeisance and put on the vow  As slaves do fetters with an aking heart  MATILDA  So wills my father never till this hour  Did I behold him so possess'd with passion  So terrible in wrath  EDWINA  O shame to nature  And what is he 'mongst Europe's kings so great  That you of force must wed  MATILDA  Nor great is he  Nor number'd amongst Europe's kings but one  Of whose inheritance there is not left  Save the free air he breathes and one faint spark  Of sickly hope that visits his sad heart  To rack it with recollection of lost right  EDWINA  What do I hear  MATILDA  Nay thou can'st never guess him  The last the lowest in thy thoughts  EDWINA  Indeed  MATILDA  To sum up my afflictions in a word  'Tis Edgar Atheling  EDWINA  Heav'ns grace forbid

law to nature  MATILDA  I am fixt  Therefore be patient had he askt my life  I wou'd obey and grant it but my heart  That is another's I cannot bestow  What I do not possess  EDWINA  Then you'll not wed  MATILDA  To Edgar never be assur'd of that  EDWINA  Oh 'tis a deed will chronicle your name  In fame's eternal records you disdain  To make a lying contract with your lips  And swerve with your affections you are fixt  You love another Oh may he you love  Kneeling I make it my most ardent prayer  Be your reward and glory live for you  And you alone and may you meet delights  Pure as your virtue lasting as your truth  MATILDA  Kind Athelina thanks bear with my weakness  And let me tell thee all my love's fond story  From the first hour I met him the bright sun  Smote on his helm which shot a fiery gleam  That dazzled all the plain before his troop  Arm'd at all points upon a snowwhite steed  Graceful he rode invention never yok'd  A fairer courser to Apollo's car  When with the zephyrs and the rosy hours  Thro' heav'n's bright portal he ascends the east  And on his beamy forehead brings the morn  EDWINA  A snowwhite steed New terrors strike my soul  Aside  MATILDA  At sight of me he stopt and from his steed  Active and featherylight he leapt to earth  EDWINA  Give me your pardon serves he in this camp  MATILDA  Yes but report prevails he left the camp  Last night o' th' sudden and this morn 'tis sad  Being return'd in presence of the King  Some proud highstomach'd lords did sharply urge  And whet him to much rage him and his friend  Earl Edwin  EDWINA  Hah 'tis he  Aside  MATILDA  Alas what shakes you  You start and tremble and your upcast eyes  Cling to heav'n's throne Know you the youth I speak of  EDWINA  As yet you have not told his name  MATILLA  'Tis Edmund  EDWINA  I had a friend and Edmund was his name  But now that name's no more  MATILDA  You had a friend  I knew it Athelina yes I saw  I saw your sorrows and I lov'd you for them  Your friend is now no moreAlas Tomorrow  May lay my Edmund low as your's but I  I shall not live as thou hast liv'd to tell it  Oh were he Edgar had he Edgar's birth  My young unknown untitled blooming rustic  Did his blood flowbut what of that My father  Reigns tho' a subject born and so shall Edmund  If virtue hath an interest in heaven  And England's throne outstands tomorrow's storm  EDWINA  Indeed  MATILDA  No power can stir me  EDWINA  What if Edmund  What if the youth you love perchance hath made  Some humbler fair his choice  MATILDA  Perish the thought  It brings distraction with it I command you  Not to suppose he can prefer another  I took you for my comforter and lo  You fix a scorpion to my breast  EDWINA  A scorpion  I pray you be not angry I wou'd kneel  And beg a blessing for you but alas  Leaden affliction lies so heavy on me  Imagination cannot stretch a wing  To raise me from the dust  MATILDA  Nay now you melt me  Prithee go in good maid I am right sorry  I spake so harshly to you Do not weep  For my sake do notyet 'tis ever thus  When the fond thought of some departed friend  Bursts unawares from memory's gushing fount  And in a flood of sorrow whelms the soul  Exeunt  End of the Third Act  ACT IV SCENE I  EDWIN  and  WALTHEOF  EDWIN  LORD Waltheof if thou hast not yet disclos'd  The royal youth forbear I do revoke  The word I gave thee  WALTHEOF  Why on what pretence  EDWIN  Edgar commands it he disclaims ambition  And will not wed Matilda  WALTHEOF  Will not wed  Edgar the most forlorn lost thing on earth  Not wed Matilda Strengthen my belief  Some wonderworking power It cannot be  EDWIN  By heav'n that knows my heart I have assail'd him  With words tears menaces entreaties pray'rs  But all all fruitless he is fixt  WALTHEOF  For shame  Some little grov'ling passion lurks about him  Some vulgar village wench whose ruddy health  And rustic manners fit his narrow soul  And kindle something he mistakes for love  EDWIN  Restrain yourself my lord your rage transports you  And yet to show I scorn a mean disguise  I own in bitterness of soul I own it  Your charge in part is true there is a maid  But not of low degree whom Edgar loves  Fatally loves but not of rustic manners  Or name ignoble  WALTHEOF  Whosoe'er she be  Evil betide her beauty she hath poison'd  The dearest hopes of a most blessed creature  Accursed as she is she hath undone  The happiness of one with whom compar'd  She were an aethiop  EDWIN  Peace unholy railer  You know not whom you curseshe is my sister  WALTHEOF  Thy sister Ah is this well done my lord  Thus am I us'd thus like your basest lacquey  Call'd and recall'd and fool'd at pleasure death  I stand for Harold him I serve if Edgar  Fondly prefers thy sister to the crown  Of England and Matilda be it so  Let Edgar so declare it to the king  I shall fulfil my promise  EDWIN  How betrayer  You pass no more this way but thro' my guard  You stand for Harold you for Justice I  Draws his sword  For suffering innocence for truth and Edgar  WALTHEOF  No more put up your sword the king advances  Thus to be found were death to both  Exit  EDWIN  Away  It is my cause that conquers not my sword  Exit  The  KING  enters follow'd by  EDGAR  KING  Now if indeed thou art that loving friend  Of Edgar Atheling which fame reports thee  Lend me thy patient ear Thou'rt not to learn  How when his grandsire good king Edmund died  Our English nobles put him from his right  And me a subject born earl Goodwyn's son  Call'd to the vacant throne so call'd of force  Obey'd I them and by a king's best title  My subjects free election took the crown  EDGAR  And took you peace withal and fair content  And conscious rectitude You took the crown  So would not I tho' it had brought dominion  Wide as the world Have you sweet sleep at nights  Do no illomen'd visions haunt your couch  And smile the eyelids of the morn upon you  When you salute the light  KING  Urge me no further  I see thou'rt noble and that manly plainness  Which some wou'd shrink from knits me closer to thee  Nay I will own thou hast call'd up a thought  Which like unweildy armour weighs me down  I do perceive shame and remorse are handmaids  That wait on guilt as darkness on the night  EDGAR  Methinks there needs no oracle for this  To tell me man is cruel false ambitious  Full of gross appetency and unjust  Is to say man is man a general truth  To which your meanest centinel shall witness  As amply as myself call in your camp  Our conference needs no privacy you say  Heaven goads the guilty breast and well you say  For goad it shall or heav'n must not be heaven  KING  Give me thy patience what thou yet hast heard  Think but the prelude to more weighty matter  I have a daughterneed I call her fair  Virtuous and full of gracemy realm's sole heiress  Her in respect of his descended right  Tho' fortunewreckt and bankrupt ev'n in hope  Edgar shall wed  EDGAR  Shall wed  KING  Hah dost thou pause  EDGAR  No if affection moves at thy command  And love must follow where ambition points  Edgar shall wed Matilda  KING  This to me  EDGAR  But if love owns no law but of the heart  And if perchance some humbler maid hath drawn  Such vows from Edgar's lips as honour frames  And fond believing innocence admits  Then  KING  What then  EDGAR  Not upon the peopled earth  No nor above the clouds resides that power  Can wrench the conscious witness from his heart  And say to Edgar he shall wed Matilda  KING  What shall a needy outlaw talk of love  A beggar plead affections and reject  Her to whom Europe's kings have knelt in vain  EDGAR  Yes for since beggars have aspir'd to crowns  Kings have declin'd to beggars  KING  Hence audacious  Nor feign for Edgar what were Edgar present  And known he dare not for his life avow  EDGAR  Know then 'tis Edgar speaks 'tis Atheling  Rejects your offer'd terms with scorn rejects them  KING  Thou Edgar  EDGAR  I am Edgar  KING  Guards arrest him  Guards advance  Yet stay a moment's pause Let me be calm  Collect thy scatter'd thoughts we yet are friends  EDGAR  No when I league with guilt and yield to fear  What honour shou'd withhold heav'n shall meet hell  Things the most fierce and opposite in nature  Shall start from their extremes and band together  Fly to thy guards defenceless and embay'd  With only truth and justice on my side  Both naked both unarm'd I do defy thee  KING  Dost thou defy me take back thy defiance  With death to better it  As Harold is giving the signal to the guard for arresting Edgar Matilda enters hastily  MATILDA  Health to my father  Why dart thine eyes such angry lightnings forth  Why stand these guards like hounds upon the slip  Is this their victim ah can he offend  Never look'd guilt like him he errs perhaps  And with too bold a speech affronts the ear  Of majesty a stranger is not bound  To all a subject's forms Let me prevail  Send him aside and hear thy daughter speak  KING  My daughter shall be heard is there a thing  I ever yet denied thee Lead him off  And wait our pleasure Hah that look hath language  As the guard lead off Edgar Matilda looks tenderly at him  Matilda know'st thou him thou dost survey  With such fond scrutiny  MATILDA  You bade me know him  Protect and cherish by his youthful graces  Conquer'd yourself you turn'd them upon me  And now what cause alas provokes this change  KING  Thou art the cause 'tis for thy sake he dies  MATILDA  Die for my sake Not if his death cou'd add  Myriads of years to my extended life  And every year bring myriads of delights  KING  These are empassion'd words Alas my child  If thou dost love this youth  MATILDA  Thou wilt destroy him  It is the savage policy of kings  KING  Thou lov'st him thenconfess  MATILDA  To desperation  To death  KING  Then heaven cannot afflict thee deeper  MATILDA  I know it but your daughter Sir can die  I speak for nature mine is not a heart  That can transfer affection tear him hence  You tear life too there is no room for Edgar  KING  Say'st thou for Edgar He that youth is Edgar  MATILDA  Harold catches her as she is falling in his arms After a pause she proceeds  Save me support meO my muchlov'd father  If he that youth be Edgar wou'dst thou kill  Him that shall be my husband  KING  What but killing  Merits that monster who rejects Matilda  MATILDA  Rejects Matilda Am I then rejected  Oh that some friend had plung'd a dagger here  Ere I had met this moment  KING  Nay be patient  MATILDA  Let me behold him and I will be patient  Was thine ear faithful did no wrongs provoke him  I found thee high in wrath he too was angry  He was he was and spake he knew not what  KING  Grant heav'n he did I am no practis'd suitor  And undeserv'd misfortune makes men proud  Hoa guardsproduce the youth you have in charge  May he who arm'd thine eyes inspire thy lips  See where he comes  Exit King  EDGAR  enters guarded  Prince so I now must call you  If while it pleas'd you to assume the name  And simple stile of a plain Scottish knight  Friendship for Edmund caus'd me to omit  What Edgar's high pretensions might have claim'd  I shall expect your pardon  EDGAR  Take my thanks  For they are much thy due  MATILDA  Nay I am told  You are too proud to be Matilda's debtor  Crowns by her hand presented you reject  And scorn the encumber'd boon Vindictive Edgar  Is it your sport to steal away our hearts  Like heathen Jove beneath a borrow'd form  Then reassume the god ascend your skies  And leave the slighted maid to die with weeping  EDGAR  What shall I say that I disclaim ambition  That long estrang'd and exil'd from my realm  My heart forgets its home and draws no sighs  Which point to England and my native right  Or with an eye of cold philosophy  Shall I affect to view that radiant form  And not confess its charms I feel their power  But cannot give that heart which is another's  MATILDA  Another's where in what proud realm is found  She from whose sight diminish'd rivals shrink  And leave the choice of all mankind to her  EDGAR  In rural silence dwells the maid I love  With her in some lone corner of your isle  Far from ambition's walk let me reside  Nor shake the quiet of Matilda's soul  MATILDA  Sure of all forms which cruelty assumes  Humility can most insult mankind  Away nor cheat me with these fairy scenes  There is no beauty in our isle for Edgar  No soft sequester'd maid no truth no love  Save what this fond rejected heart contains  EDGAR  Thus urg'd t'were meanness to withhold the truth  In Hackley's shades a Sylvan goddess holds  Her lonely haunts Edwina is her name  Earl Edwin's sister  MATILDA  Take her and be still  That abject thing thou art take Edwin's sister  A subject beauty fits a subject's choice  Go to my father tell him thou hast pierc'd  His daughter's heart and give him stab for stab  Away away thou hast thy full revenge  EDGAR  Revenge my heart disclaims it O Matilda  My prayersI can no morefarewel for ever  Exit  As  EDGAR  is parting from  MATILDA EDWINA  enters  EDWINA  'Tis EdgarHah he parts and sees me not  MATILDA  Stay Athelina turn beloved maid  Turn from that monster thine abhorrent eyes  Approach and save me  EDWINA  What afflicts Matilda  MATILDA  And is there need of words break break my heart  Open thou prisonhouse of the soul dissolve  And give a wretched captive it's release  EDWINA  Be calm  MATILDA  As death Why look'd you on that youth  EDWINA  I look'd not on his face  MATILDA  Ah if thou had'st  If thou had'st look'd thou woud'st have lov'd like me  And like me been a wretch  EDWINA  Alas I pity thee  MATILDA  Then thou hast lov'd for love will teach thee pity  Coud'st thou believe it he O heaven that Edmund  Whose very name's a lye that Edgar Atheling  For Edwin's sister slights rejects Matilda  A princess for a clown me for Edwina  Strike her smooth form all o'er with lep'rous blanes  Ye sprites whom magic incantations charm  Shake her with palsied ugliness ye demons  And so present her to her lover's arms  To kill him with the touchO Athelina  If thou dost love me join and aid the curse  EDWINA  Shall I curse her who never hath offended  MATILDA  Turn then on him thy deepest direst curse  Call up the damn'd and darken heav'n with spells  EDWINA  Mercy forbid  MATILDA  No mercy but revenge  Give me revenge He dies  EDWINA  Ah take my life  Lo at thy feet a wretched virgin kneels  And prays for mercy  MATILDA  Hence you'll anger me  EDWINA  I wou'd I cou'd Turn thy revenge on me  But spare my Edgar's life  MATILDA  Thy Edgar say'st thou  Who and what art thou Speak  EDWINA  I am Edwina  MATILDA  What do I hear thou art  EDWINA  I am Edwina  Here is that bosom thou wou'dst plant with sores  And spotted leprosy that fatal form  Which thou wou'dst rouse the demons up from hell  To strike with palsied ugliness behold  I am the wretch whom thou didst call to aid  Thy curse on Edgar Mark how I will curse him  O all ye saints and angels every spirit  Kneeling  Who wing'st this nether air with pinions dipt  In heav'n's etherial dew make him your care  And gathering o'er his head your plumed band  Form a celestial canopy above him  To fence off this destroyer  MATILDA  Peace deceiver  Thy prayers are vain he dies this moment  She is going  EDWINA  Stay  Tho' not in pity yet in honour hear me  I ask no mercy prayers indeed are vain  Edwina pleads not ev'n for Edgar's life  For if when I the fatal cause of all  Lye at thy feet a bloody breathless corse  Thy rage shou'd still demand his guiltless life  Who shall oppose it All that I shall do  All that I can is thusto die for Edgar  Offers to kill herself but is prevented by Matilda  MATILDA  Stop thy rash hand thou shalt not die This courage  Dazzles my rage I stiffen with surprise  Thy presence like the fascinating eye  Of the fixt basilisk takes motion from me  And roots me in the earth  EDWINA  What shall I say  I own thee wretched and myself the cause  But do not let remorseless fury rend  The god from out thine heart which nature's hand  Set up as in a shrine of human kindness  That misery like mine might find a shelter  MATILDA  No more I once had pity the poor bird  Which kills herself to feed her gaping brood  Was not more pitiful but it is past  The wolf hath slain the lamb bloody revenge  Hath thrust out all remorseI must have vengeance  EDWINA  Take it 'tis in thine handTake full revenge  Thou hast a dagger strike to Edgar's heart  Lay his lov'd form a breathless corse before thee  And sate thy thirst for vengeanceHah 'tis past  Heaven opens in thine eyes  MATILDA  'Tis in my heart  I feel its breath like dew descend upon me  Amidst the whirl of passion Mercy sits  And whispers patience in a voice so charming  To hear is to obeyThy Edgar lives  EDWINA  Lives he May angels waft the word to heaven  And bring a blessing thence  MATILDA  Stay not to thank me  Bear from my sight that tooengaging form  Leave me to my afflictions they'll stay with me  And be my close companionsFare thee well  EDWINA  Farewel thou suffering virtue Oh remember  Remember Edgar  Exit Edwina  MATILDA  Whither was I sinking  When this bright deed restor'd me So the wretch  With felon

Born to each grace with every virtue blest  How can Matilda ask of Edgar this  Sure I were lost to every manly feeling  If honour'd thus I shou'd forbear to hold  Whilst memory lives thy image present

weapon  Fell from my woman's hand Again I lookt  No English banner floated in the air  Save where my father fought revolting nature  Shrunk from the scene and soon a scalding flood  Of tears burst forth that quench'd these orbs of sight  EDWINA  Where shall I turn  MATILDA  To death  EDWINA  Dreadful resort  MATILDA  And yet when Hope our last kind nursing friend  Forsakes her patient's couch and dark despair  Puts out that light which like a nightly beacon  Points to the harbour where the foundering bark  Of misery may steer Ah whither then  Shall life's benighted passenger resort  But to oblivion and the allcovering grave  EDWINA  Why then when death had arm'd my uplifted hand  Didst thou prevent the blow and bid me live  MATILDA  Live but till Edgar falls then rear the blow  I'll not

hireling troops had fled one native phalanx  Fatally brave yet stood there deepengulph'd  Within the Norman host I found thy father  Mounted like Mars upon a pile of slain  Frowning he fought and wore his helmet up  His batter'd harness at each ghastly sluice  Streaming with blood life gush'd at every vein  Yet liv'd he as in proud despight of nature  His mighty soul unwilling to forsake  Its princely dwelling swift as thought I flew  And as a sturdy churl his poleaxe aim'd  Full at the hero's crest I sprung upon him  And sheath'd my rapier in the caitiff's throat  MATILDA  Didst thou then thou art faithful Open wide  And shower your blessings on his head ye heav'ns  EDGAR  A while the fainting hero we upheld  For Edwin now had join'd me but as well  We might have driv'n the mountain cataract  Back to its source as stemm'd the battle's tide  I saw the imperial Duke and with loud insults  Provok'd him to the combat but in vain  The pursey braggart now secure of conquest  Rein'd in his steed and wing'd his squadron round  To cut us from retreat cold death had stopt  Thy father's heart ev'n hope itself had died  'Midst showers of darts we bore him from the field  And now

with soldiers  Welcome brave Edwin thou bring'st hope for England  EDWINA  comes out of the Tent  EDWINA  Horror on horror when will death have end  Some fiery dog star reigns and deadly madness  Strikes all below the moon Scarce had they set  Their mournful burthen down when  ollowing quick  She rush'd into the tent and raising up  Her father's mantle snatcht one eager look  Then with uplifted eyes and heaving sighs  Seizing his sword with strong determin'd grasp  Plung'd it into her breast Behold she comes  MATILDA  enters supported  MATILDA  'Tis done the faithful point hath

my sins forgive  As I thy father  MATILDA  'Tis enough farewel  Life's storm is past wave after wave subsides  The turbid passions sink and all is peace  Ambition jealousy nay love itself  Last

 Save the last hope of England and retreat  EDGAR  Retreat shall English warriors hear that word  And from an English king No Siffric never  Unfurl the Saxon standard See my lords  Twice taken in the fight and twice recover'd  The hereditary glory lives with Edgar  Beneath that banner godlike Alfred conquer'd  Beneath that banner drench'd in Danish blood  My grandsire  Ironsided  Edmund fought  Wrench'd from my infant grasp a bold usurper  Seiz'd it possest it died in it's defence  And shall I in the tame respect of life  With closefurl'd ensigns trailing in the dust  Halt in the rear of fame No gallant English  Turn not but as the galled panther turns  To lick his wounds and with recruited fury  Spring to the fight afresh So turn so stand  And from this height ennobled by your valour  Hurl bold defiance to the foe beneath  Drums c  THE END
