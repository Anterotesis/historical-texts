 THE APOLOGY  PRICE ONE SHILLING  THE APOLOGY  ADDRESSED TO THE CRITICAL REVIEWERS  BY C CHURCHILL  Tristitiam et metus  Tradam protervis in mare CRITICUM  Portare ventis  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR and sold by W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInnGate Holborn MDCCLXI  THE APOLOGY  ADDRESSED TO THE CRITICAL REVIEWERS  _LAUGHS not the heart when Giants big with pride  Assume the pompous port the martial stride  O'er arm Herculean heave th' enormous shield  Vast as a weaver's beam the javelin wield  With the loud voice of thund'ring JOVE defy  And dare to single combatWhatA Fly  AND laugh we less when Giant names which shine  Establish'd as it were by right divine  Critics whom ev'ry captive art adores  To whom glad Science pours forth all her stores  Who high in letter'd reputation sit  And hold ASTRAEA like the scales of Wit  With partial rage rush forthOh shame to tell  To crush a bard just bursting from the shell  GREAT are his perils in this stormy time  Who rashly ventures on a sea of Rhime  Around vast surges roll winds envious blow  And jealous rocks and quicksands lurk below  Greatly his foes he dreads but more his friends  He hurts me most who lavishly commends  LOOK thro' the worldin ev'ry other trade  The same employment's cause of kindness made  At least appearance of good will creates  And ev'ry fool puffs off the fool he hates  Cobblers with cobblers smoke away the night  And in the common cause e'en play'rs unite  Authors alone with more than savage rage  Unnat'ral war with brother authors wage  The pride of Nature would as soon admit  Competitors in empire as in wit  Onward they rush at Fame's imperious call  And less than greatest would not be at all  SMIT with the love of Honouror the Pence  O'errun with wit and destitute of sense  If any novice in the rhiming trade  With lawless pen the realms of verse invade  Forth from the court where scepter'd sages sit  Abus'd with praise and flatter'd into wit  Where in lethargic majesty they reign  And what they won by dullness still maintain  Legions of factious authors throng at once  Fool beckons fool and dunce awakens dunce  To H  M  LT  N's the Ready Lies repair  Ne'er was Lie made which was not welcome there  Thence on maturer judgment's anvil wrought  The polish'd falshood's into public brought  Quick circulating slanders mirth afford  And reputation bleeds in ev'ry word  A CRITIC was of old a glorious name  Whose sanction handed merit up to fame  Beauties as well as faults he brought to view  His Judgment great and great his Candour too  No servile rules drew sickly taste aside  Secure he walk'd for Nature was his guide  But now Oh strange reverse our Critics bawl  In praise of Candour with a Heart of Gall  Conscious of guilt and fearful of the light  They lurk enshrouded in the veil of night  Safe from detraction seize the unwary prey  And stab like bravoes all who come that way  WHEN first my Muse perhaps more bold than wise  Bad the rude trifle into light arise  Little she thought such tempests would ensue  Less that those tempests would be rais'd by you  The thunder's fury rends the tow'ring oak  Rosciads like shrubs might 'scape the fatal stroke  Vain thought A Critic's fury knows no bound  Drawcansir like he deals destruction round  Nor can we hope he will a stranger spare  Who gives no quarter to his friend VOLTAIRE  UNHAPPY Genius plac'd by partial Fate  With a free spirit in a slavish state  Where the reluctant Muse oppress'd by kings  Or droops in silence or in fetters sings  In vain thy dauntless fortitude hath borne  The bigot's furious zeal and tyrant's scorn  Why did'st thou safe from homebred dangers steer  Reserv'd to perish more ignobly here  Thus when the Julian tyrant's pride to swell  Rome with her POMPEY at Pharsalia fell  The vanquish'd chief escap'd from CAESAR's hand  To die by ruffians in a foreign land  HOW could these selfelected monarchs raise  So large an empire on so small a base  In what retreat inglorious and unknown  Did Genius sleep when Dullness seiz'd the throne  Whence absolute now grown and free from awe  She to the subject world dispenses law  Without her licence not a letter stirs  And all the captive criss cross row is her's  The stagyrite who rules from Nature drew  Opinions gave but gave his reasons too  Our great Dictators take a shorter way  Who shall dispute what the Reviewers say  Their word's sufficient and to ask a reason  In such a state as their's is downright treason  True judgment now with Them alone can dwell  Like church of Rome they're grown infallible  Dull superstitious readers they deceive  Who pin their easy faith on critic's sleeve  And knowing nothing ev'ry thing believe  But why repine we that these Puny Elves  Shoot into GiantsWe may thank ourselves  Fools that we are like Israel's fools of yore  The Calf ourselves have fashion'd we adore  But let true Reason once resume her reign  This God shall dwindle to a Calf again  FOUNDED on arts which shun the face of day  By the same arts they still maintain their sway  Wrapp'd in mysterious secrecy they rise  And as they are unknown are safe and wise  At whomsoever aim'd howe'er severe  Th' envenom'd slander flies no names appear  Prudence forbid that stepThen all might know  And on more equal terms engage the foe  But now what Quixote of the age would care  To wage a war with dirt and fight with air  By int'rest join'd th' expert confed'rates stand  And play the game into each other's hand  The vile abuse in turn by all deny'd  Is bandy'd up and down from side to side  It fliesheyprestolike a jugler's ball  'Till it belongs to nobody at all  ALL men and things they know themselves unknown  And publish ev'ry nameexcept their own  Nor think this strangesecure from vulgar eyes  The nameless author passes in disguise  But vet'ran critics are not so deceiv'd  If vet'ran critics are to be believ'd  Once seen they know an author evermore  Nay swear to hands they never saw before  Thus in the ROSCIAD beyond chance or doubt  They by the writing found the writers out  " That's LLOYD'shis manner there you plainly trace  " And all the ACTOR stares you in the face  " By COLMAN that was writtenOn my life  " The strongest symptoms of the JEALOUS WIFE  " That little disingenuous piece of spite  " CHURCHILL a wretch unknown perhaps might write"  How doth it make judicious readers smile  When authors are detected by their stile  Tho' ev'ry one who knows this author knows  He shifts his stile much oftner than his cloaths  WHENCE could arise this mighty critic spleen  The Muse a trifler and her theme so mean  What had I done that angry HEAVEN should send  The bitt'rest Foe where most I wish'd a Friend  Oft hath my tongue been wanton at thy name  And hail'd the honours of thy matchless fame  For me let hoary FIELDING bite the ground  So nobler PICKLE stand superbly bound  From LIVY's temples tear th' historic crown  Which with more justice blooms upon thine own  Compar'd with thee be all lifewriters dumb  But he who wrote the Life of TOMMY THUMB  Who ever read the REGICIDE but swore  The author wrote as man ne'er wrote before  Others for plots and underplots may call  Here's the right methodhave no plot at all  Who can so often in his cause engage  The tiny Pathos of the Grecian stage  Whilst horrors rise and tears spontaneous flow  At tragic Ha and no less tragic Oh  His NERVOUS WEAKNESS all to praise agree  And then for sweetness who so sweet as he  Too big for utterance when sorrows swell  The too big sorrows flowing tears must tell  But when those flowing tears shall cease to flow  Whythen the voice must speak again you know  RUDE and unskilful in the Poet's trade  I kept no Naiads by me readymade  Ne'er did I colours high in air advance  Torn from the bleeding fopperies of France  No flimsey linseywoolsey scenes I wrote  With patches here and there like Joseph's coat  Me humbler themes befit Secure for me  Let Playwrights smuggle nonsense duty free  Secure for me ye lambs ye lambkins bound  And frisk and frolic o'er the fairy ground  Secure for me thou pretty little fawn  Lick SYLVIA's hand and crop the flow'ry lawn  Uncensur'd let the gentle breezes rove  Thro' the green umbrage of th' enchanted grove  Secure for me let foppish Nature smile  And play the coxcomb in the DESART ISLE  THE Stage I chosea subject fair and free  'Tis yours'tis mine'tis Public Property  All Common Exhibitions open lye  For Praise or Censure to the Common Eye  Hence are a thousand Hackneywriters fed  Hence Monthly Critics earn their Daily Bread  This is a gen'ral tax which all must pay  From those who scribble down to those who play  Actors a venal crew receive support  From public bounty for the public sport  To clap or hiss all have an equal claim  The cobbler's and his lordship's right the same  All join for their subsistence all expect  Free leave to praise their worth their faults correct  When active PICKLE Smithfield stage ascends  The three days wonder of his laughing friends  Each or as judgment or as fancy guides  The lively witling praises or derides  And where's the mighty diff'rence tell me where  Betwixt a Merry Andrew and a Play'r  THE strolling tribe a despicable race  Like wand'ring Arabs shift from place to place  Vagrants by law to justice open laid  They tremble of the beadle's lash afraid  And fawning cringe for wretched means of life  To Madam May'ress or his Worship's Wife  The mighty monarch in theatric sack  Carries his whole regalia at his back  His royal consort heads the female band  And leads the heirapparent in her hand  The pannier'd ass creeps on with conscious pride  Bearing a future prince on either side  No choice musicians in this troop are found  To varnish nonsense with the charms of sound  No swords no daggers not one poison'd bowl  No lightning flashes here no thunders roll  No guards to swell the monarch's train are shewn  The monarch here must be an host ALONE  No solemn pomp no slow processions here  No Ammon's entry and no Juliet's bier  BY need compell'd to prostitute his art  The varied actor flies from part to part  And strange disgrace to all theatric pride  His character is shifted with his side  Question and Answer he by turns must be  Like that small wit in MODERN TRAGEDY  Who to support his fameor fill his purse  Still pilfers wretched plans and makes them worse  Like gypsies least the stolen brat be known  Defacing first then claiming for his own  In shabby state they strut and tatter'd robe  The scene a blanket and a barn the globe  No high conceits their mod'rate wishes raise  Content with humble profit humble praise  Let dowdies simper and let bumpkins stare  The strolling pageant heroe treads in air  Pleas'd for his hour he to mankind gives law  And snores the next out on a truss of straw  BUT if kind Fortune who we sometimes know  Can take a heroe from a puppetshew  In mood propitious should her fav'rite call  On royal stage in royal pomp to bawl  Forgetful of himself he rears the head  And scorns the dunghill where he first was bred  Conversing now with welldress'd kings and queens  With gods and goddesses behind the scenes  He sweats beneath the terrornodding plume  Taught by Mock Honours Real Pride t' assume  On this great stage the World no monarch e'er  Was half so haughty as a MonarchPlayer  DOTH it more move our anger or our mirth  To see these THINGS the lowest sons of earth  Presume with selfsufficient knowledge grac'd  To rule in Letters and preside in Taste  The TOWN's decisions they no more admit  Themselves alone the ARBITERS of Wit  And scorn the jurisdiction of that COURT  To which they owe their being and support  Actors like monks of old now sacred grown  Must be attack'd by no fools but their own  LET the Vain Tyrant sit amidst his guards  His puny GREENROOM Wits and Venal Bards  Who meanly tremble at the Puppet's frown  And for a Playhouse Freedom lose their own  In spite of newmade Laws and newmade Kings  The freeborn Muse with lib'ral spirit sings  Bow down ye Slaves before these Idols fall  Let Genius stoop to them who've none all  Ne'er will I flatter cringe or bend the knee  To those who Slaves to ALL are Slaves to ME  ACTORS as Actors are a lawful game  The poet's right and Who shall bar his claim  And if o'erweening of their little skill  When they have left the Stage they're Actors still  If to the subject world they still give laws  With paper crowns and sceptres made of straws  If they in cellar or in garret roar  And Kings one night are Kings for evermore  Shall not bold Truth e'en there pursue her theme  And wake the Coxcomb from his golden dream  Or if well worthy of a better fate  They rise superior to their present state  If with each social virtue grac'd they blend  The gay companion and the faithful friend  If they like PRITCHARD join in private life  The tender parent and the virtuous wife  Shall not our Verse their praise with pleasure speak  Though Mimics bark and Envy split her cheek  No honest worth's beneath the Muse's praise  No greatness can above her censure raise  Station and wealth to Her are trifling things  She stoops to Actors and she soars to Kings  IS there a man in vice and folly bred  To sense of honour as to virtue dead  Whom ties nor human nor divine can bind  Alien to GOD and foe to all mankind  Who spares no character whose ev'ry word  Bitter as gall and sharper than the sword  Cuts to the quick whose thoughts with rancour swell  Whose tongue on earth performs the work of Hell  If there be such a monster the REVIEWS  Shall find him holding forth against Abuse  " Attack Profession'tis a deadly breach  " The Christian laws another lesson teach  " Unto the end should charity endure  " And Candour hide those faults it cannot cure"  Thus Candour's maxims flow from Rancour's throat  As devils to serve their purpose Scripture quote  THE Muse's office was by HEAVEN design'd  To please improve instruct reform mankind  To make dejected Virtue nobly rise  Above the tow'ring pitch of splendid Vice  To make pale Vice abash'd her head hang down  And trembling crouch at Virtue's awful frown  Now arm'd with wrath she bids eternal shame  With strictest justice brands the villain's name  Now in the milder garb of Ridicule  She sports and pleases while she wounds the Fool  Her shape is often varied but her aim  To prop the cause of Virtue still the same  In praise of Mercy let the guilty bawl  When Vice and Folly for Correction call  Silence the mark of weakness justly bears  And is partaker of the crimes it spares  BUT if the Muse too cruel in her mirth  With harsh reflexions wound the man of worth  If wantonly she deviate from her plan  And quits the Actor to expose the Man  Asham'd she marks that passage with a blot  And hates the line where Candour was forgot  BUT what is Candour what is Humour's vein  Tho' Judgment join to consecrate the strain  If curious numbers will not aid afford  Nor choicest music play in ev'ry word  Verses must run to charm a modern ear  From all harsh rugged interruptions clear  Soft let them breathe as Zephyr's balmy breeze  Smooth let their current flow as summer seas  Perfect then only deem'd when they dispense  A happy tuneful vacancy of sense  Italian fathers thus with barb'rous rage  Fit helpless infants for the squeaking stage  Deaf to the calls of pity Nature wound  And mangle vigour for the sake of sound  Henceforth farewell then fev'rish thirst of fame  Farewell the longings for a Poet's name  Perish my Musea wish 'bove all severe  To him who ever held the Muses dear  If e'er her labours weaken to refine  Th' gen'rous roughness of a nervous line  OTHERS affect the stiff and swelling phrase  Their Muse must walk in stilts and strut in stays  The sense they murder and the words transpose  Lest Poetry approach too near to Prose  See tortur'd Reason how they pare and trim  And like Procrustes stretch or lop the limb  WALLER whose praise succeeding bards rehearse  Parent of harmony in English verse  Whose tuneful Muse in sweetest accent flows  In couplets first taught straggling sense to close  IN polish'd numbers and majestic sound  Where shall thy rival POPE be ever found  But whilst each line with equal beauty flows  E'en excellence unvary'd tedious grows  Nature thro' all her works in great degree  Borrows a blessing from VARIETY  Music itself her needful aid requires  To rouze the soul and wake our dying fires  Still in one key the Nightingale would teize  Still in one key not BRENT would always please  HERE let me bend great DRYDEN at thy shrine  Thou dearest name to all the tuneful nine  What if some dull lines in cold order creep  And with his theme the poet seems to sleep  Still when his subject rises proud to view  With equal strength the poet rises too  With strong invention noblest vigour fraught  Thought still springs up and rises out of thought  Numbers ennobling numbers in their course  In varied sweetness flow in varied force  The pow'rs of Genius and of Judgment join  And the Whole Art of Poetry is Thine  BUT what are Numbers what are Bards to me  Forbid to tread the paths of Poesy  " A sacred muse should consecrate her Pen  " Priests must not hear nor see like other Men  " Far higher themes should her ambition claim  " Behold where STERNHOLD points the way to Fame"  WHILST with mistaken zeal dull bigots burn  Let REASON for a moment take her turn  When Coffeesages hold discourse with kings  And blindly walk in Paper Leadingstrings  What if a man delight to pass his time  In spinning Reason into harmless Rhime  Or sometimes boldly venture to the Play  Say Where's the CrimeGreat Man of Prudence say  No two on earth in one thing can agree  All have some darling singularity  Women and men as well as girls and boys  In Gewgaws take delight and sigh for toys  Your sceptres and your crowns and such like things  Are but a better kind of toys for kings  In things indiff'rent REASON bids us chuse  Whether the Whim's a MONKEY or a MUSE  WHAT the grave triflers on this busy scene  When they make use of this word REASON mean  I know not but according to my plan  'TIS LORDCHEIFJUSTICE in the COURT OF MAN  Equally form'd to rule in age and youth  The Friend of Virtue and the Guide to Truth  To HER I bow whose sacred power I feel  To HER decision make my last appeal  Condemn'd by HER applauding worlds in vain  Should tempt me to resume the Pen again  By HER absolv'd my course I'll still pursue  If REASON's for me GOD is for me too  FINIS
