 THE INSOLVENT OR FILIAL PIETY A TRAGEDY  ACTED AT THE THEATRE in the HAYMARKET By AUTHORITY Under the DIRECTION of Mr CIBBER  WRITTEN BY THE LATE AARON HILL  Esq  AUTHOR OF MEROPE Partly on a Plan of Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT's and Mr MASSENGER's  LONDON  rinted and sold by W REEVE opposite  CraneCourt  in  FleetStreet  MDCCLVIII Price One Shilling and Sixpence  PREFACE  ABOVE thirty years ago Mr WILKS then one of the patentees of the theatre royal gave an old manuscript play call'd  The Guiltless Adultress or Judge in his own Cause  to Mr THEOPHILUS CIBBER who was then manager of what us'd to be call'd  the summer company  This company consisted in general of the junior part of the performers who during the vacation time commonly acted twice or thrice a week As they play'd on shares divided in proportion according to their several salaries stipulated in the winter their endeavours to please the town generally produc'd 'em double pay on those nights sometimes more  This kept most of 'em from strolling into the country for the summer season it added to their income and gave 'em an opportunity of getting forward in their business in a more regular manner than has been practis'd of late years It had its effect performers then try'd their force in characters in the summer and became by practice therein gradually acquainted with their business and the town with them Nor was every one suppos'd to be equal at their very setting out to the most capital characters of the drama  But to return to the playBy the hand and the long time it had been in the possession of the managers it was suppos'd to have been one of Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT's formerly a patentee and by the opening of the piece palpably was founded on a play of MASSENGER's call'd  The Fatal Dowry  this last piece has often been enquired after in vainMr WILKS recommended it to Mr CIBBER to be got up in the summer with some alterationsIt lay by some timeIn the year it was intended for the stage in the summerBut the performers were then shut out of the theatre by the then patentees of DruryLaneA candid account of which will be given when Mr CIBBER has a proper opportunity to speak thereof in his purpos'd history of the stage  In the following year when the principal comedians of that time return'd from the theatre in the HayMarket and play'd under the direction of Mr FLETEWOOD it was propos'd agen to have a summer company as the use of it both to the actors and managers had been experienced Many light pieces were then reviv'd and several new petit pieces brought on the stage such as  The Devil to Pay The Mock Doctor  c which prov'd afterwards lasting entertainments in the winter season  'Twas in  The Devil to Pay  in a summer season Mrs CLIVE then Miss KAFTOR first surpriz'd a delighted audience with a proof of her extraordinary genius in the character of NELL Her spirited simplicity and strong natural humour carried her thro' the part with an astonishing variety and propriety She shew'd herself an excellent originalShe has had many followers some imitators and 'tis but justice to add no equal She then promis'd to be what she has since prov'd one of the first performers of the stage and when judiciously examined in the general various cast of parts she acts 'tis imagined she will be allow'd not to be inferior to any performer of her time  Well this is digression on digressionpardon it reader and let it passIn a summer company was agen propos'd They play'd once the play of  George Barnwell  to a very great house The manager jealous least the company shou'd get too much order'd the farther acting to be stopp'd It was judg'd indeed the jealousy of some actors who were not concern'd in the summer gave this adviceso the affair dropp'dand there has been no summer playing since  But to return to our playOn a revisal it was judg'd to want some alterationsAccordingly Mr CIBBEE requested his kind friend the late Mr HILL who was never happier than when he had an opportunity to do a friendly office to correct itHow much he was taken with the play will appear on a perusal of some letters of his relative thereto publish'd in his collection and sent to Mr THEOPHILUS CIBBER about the year Let it suffice here to addMr HILL almost new wrote the whole and the last act was entirely his in conduct sentiment diction c  It was brought on the stage at the theatre in the HayMarket early this year When his Grace the Duke of DEVONSHIRE humanely consider'd the unfortunate extraordinary condition of a comedian who has had more frequent opportunities of happily entertaining the town and gave him liberty to try his fortune awhile at the little theatre in the HayMarket  But what mighty matters could be hop'd from a young raw unexperienced company hastily collected and as hastily to be employ'd but sinking men catch at reeds while establish'd theatres were open to entertain the town with the united force of tragedy comedy opera pantomime song dance and a long train of  et ceteras  Some rational and some other exhibitions which are so frequently follow'd in a winter season  Mr CIBBER was out of pocket by his undertaking yet this does not prevent his having a grateful sense of the favours he received from those noble personages and other friends who have frequently pratonis'd his undertakingsTo acknowledge a favour is but gratitudeTo name the persons might appear vanity  It may not be improper on this occasion to signify as Mr CIBBER has not had the wish'd success at the theatre in the HayMarketThat Mr RICH has with great goodnature granted the use of his theatre in CoventGarden to Mr CIBBER for his benefit the beginning of next monthWhen a  new mocktragedy  which many persons of taste have approv'd of and which the author has kindly allow'd Mr CIBBER to make use of on this occasion will be acted with all the variety of scenes machines songs dirges processions c crequisite to embellish  alamoderne  this extraordinary heroick piece  PROLOGUE  Spoke by Mr CIBBER Then in mourning for his father  OUR scenes tonight would nature's pangs impart  True filiel piety should reach the heart  I feel it nowThat thought the tear shall claim  To merit sacred and immortal fame  Now sleeps the honour'd dust which gave me birth  Recent in death but newly lodg'd in earth  Forgive the heartfelt grief the filial lay  The public tear might drop o'er CIBBER's clay  His comic forcefor more than half an age  His wellwrote moral scene his manly page  Your fathers fathers pleas'dHis scenes shall live  And to your childrens children equal pleasure give  Forgive the filial dews that thus distil  'Tis from the heart they flow and not from skill  By nature mov'd your patience thus I try  Art would but give my suff'ring soul the lie  Now for the father's sake the son endure  Let his paternal worth your smile secure  Let his rich merit my poor wants attone  His high desert I pleadBoast none my own  Let then this tribute to the father due  This public tribute be approv'd by you  Whatever faults may thro' this piece be shewn  No living bard can now those faults attone  While such you transient markLet mercy spare  Such parts as you may think some merit share  Where judgment wakes let candour intervene  Mark out the failings with that golden mean  Nor for a single sentence damn a scene  To our young actors too your smiles extend  Youth claims indulgenceas want claims a friend  Whate'er their flatt'ring hopes their fears are great  Which your applause alone can dissipate  And 'tis a maxim with the truly brave  They triumph most who generously save  PROLOGUE  By the Late AARON HILL  Esq  POOR at first op'ning seems the plot we chuse  But no felt indigence unfir'd the muse  Insolvent pris'nerbears no awful sound  Yethope strong buildingson that humble ground  Debtor and creditor th' account begin  But then comes joywifemis'rydeath and sin  While from these varying lights fierce fires we raise  Lend but attentionand your tears shall praise  Few are the public stains that tinge the fame  Of this brave rich goodnatur'd nation's name  Yet one there isfrom time's long license grown  That blots out pityand turns flesh to stone  'Tisthe deaf rage that where hard wants oppress  Doubles th' insolvent suff'rer's dire distress  Stung by this wasp past friendships lose their weight  Warp'd estimation wears a face like hate  Suspended mercy bids affliction smart  And in a scale of flint immures her heart  Selfyet unreach'd by woemade proud by gain  Blind to disasterand insulting pain  In ease shortsightedhugs her lot secure  And marks no diff'rence'twixt the base and poor  Flings from calamity turns short on grief  And to the prison's grave refers relief  Sofor awhiletriumphantly severe  Tow'rs the bid insultand disdains to hear  At last comes disappointment homeThen starts  Touch'd senseand wonders at mens cruel hearts  Then self still upmost the rous'd sleeper shakes  And insolently hopescompassion wakes  But scorn close waits upon the scorner's heel  And he that shunn'd to hearvouchsafes to feel  Too late he feelsThe Eye that wakes for all  Foredoom'd his anguishand enjoys his fall  Points to his trembling view that wise man's school  That godgiven lawth' alltemp'ring golden rule  Bids him thank bitterness for due despair  And since he cou'd not pity learn to bear  From our last age's plays exemplar aim  Present and past we find too much the same  Stern unrelenting int'rest's partial will  Reign'd then resistlessand it reigns so still  How happy were th' effectcou'd miseries here  From pride's correction mourn'd by pity's tear  Teach the dry rock to melt in paintouch'd flow  And ease th' unhoping crouds that sigh in woe

rigour in the laws  But doubling ev'ry wound that mercy feels  Treat pity like a guiltOh shame of state  This strictness of your sour decree that grinds  The debtor's dying bones to feast the spight  Of a still greedy creditor who gapes  For payment from the grave's unclosing dust  Condemns misfortune to let crimes go free  Old AUMELE  You sir that prate thus saucily what are you  LA FOY  I am a

dumb disdain  Shrinks from their bloodshot beams and frowns within  Long had they been ere this by some fierce hand  Torn from their tasteless orbs or sav'd for shame  Had justly weeping serv'd some needy foe  Had I not worn a sword and us'd it better  Than in disgrace of law thou dost thy tongue  Old AUMELE  If insolence like this pass here unpunish'd  LA FOY  Yet Iwho in my country's balanc'd

this curse not reach him  You clods  To the creditors  in human forms that cou'd deny  Earth gentler than your own its mournful claim  To cover the remains of that great chief  May all your wives prove false and bring you heirs  Of liberal hearts whose riots may undo you  Your factors all prove thieves your debtors bankrupts  And thou stern patron of their blushless plea  Live to lose all thy

am so deeply sunk  In misery's gulph so hopeless in distress  'Twou'd seem the rash man's means to cure despair  By casting off his load that ends with life  Nolet my suffering duty to the dead  Live

bless his country  Exact his country's mercyWhat tho' my father  Ere scarce arriv'd at youth out acted man  Number'd that day no part of life wherein  He snatch'd not some new trophy from your foes  Was he for that to triumph o'er your courts  Superior to the laws he fought to save  What tho' the sums he dy'd indebted for  Were borrow'd not for his but publick use  Shou'd he be free from payment because poor  From a spent patrimony kindly spread  To the starv'd soldiers wants'Twas his brave choice  And when the willing sufferare they wrong'd  Old AUMELE  The precedent were ill  CHALONS  True my kind lord  What is it to your courts that weigh but laws  That after all our great defeats in war  Which in their dreadful ruins buried quick  Courage and hope in all men but himself  He forc'd the

from the law  That lends your selon hearts the weight of right  I know there is no musick to your ears  More pleasing than the groans of men in pain  The tears of widows and the orphans cry  Feast but your happier sense of wealth's coarse joy  But rather than my father's reverend dust  Shall want its place in that still monument  Where all his silent ancestors sleep safe  Take me your living

extacy of matchless virtue  Worthy of happier fortune nobler fate  But rest that now unarguedTo my cause  Already I have found your lordships bounty  So lavish in your grants that it should teach me  To limit my desires to narrower bounds  d PRESIDENT  There's nothing you can ask we wou'd not grant  d PRESIDENT  Our wills are all your own pray use 'em freely  VALDORE  It has been here you know the court's kind custom  Confirm'd by time's long venerable practice  That at surrender of the place I held  Some grant indulg'd confirms a favour ask'd  As proof then of your grace that loves to give  I
