 What if the  SWEDES  Should COME  What if the  Swedes  should Come WITH SOME THOUGHTS About Keeping The ARMY on Foot Whether they Come or Not  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS near the  OxfordArms  in  WarwickLane  MDCCXVII Price SixPence  What if the SWEDES should Come  _I Have been mighty willing to have had the King of  Sweden  been my Hero for some Years past His early Gallantry the Injuries done him by his Enemies which at first drew him into the War and many other Considerations gave me warm Inclinations to his Interest For 'tis natural to all honest Men to entertain favourable Thoughts for Gallant Princes however unfortunate  The first Shock I receiv'd in my Opinion of his Conduct was when he lay still so many Months in  Saxony  with a great Army refused the Glory of healing the Breaches of  Europe  which seemed then all to be offer'd to his  Arbitrium  and went upon a desperate Enterprize of dethroning the  Czar  of  Muscovy  a Prince whose Strength consisted at that Time rather in the Distance and Barrenness of his Countrey than the Superiority of his Force  'Tis needless to enter into the History of his  Swedish  Majesty's Affairs since then which indeed have been but one continu'd Train of Misfortunes yet even under these the Vigor of his Courage has carry'd him on with such an unmov'd Steddiness of Resolution that had not some of his Attempts seem'd desperately extravagant it was hard not to have a secret Respect for so much unfortunate Gallantry  But if what we expect now from him should go on if he should make this most ridiculous Attempt for such I must call it I shall believe him entirely  demented  considering his own present Circumstances divested of all his  German  Dominions destitute of Allies without Money and at War with Five Potent Princes already who are every Hour expected to Land in the Heart of his Dominions If this Attempt should be made I shall have no more to say than this What may not be expected from a King that sleeps in his Boots and lies in the Straw  Having other Discourses therefore before me than a bare Enquiry by Guess and a meer Search after the Conjectures of Men Whether the King of  Sweden  intends to come hither or no I shall wave the insignificant Debate and take it for granted according to the common Opinion that we are really  to expect him    I must make one Provision however as I go on which the Iniquity of the Times makes necessary and which the Malice of Men also gives me Reason for it being natural for some People to charge every Man that speaks honourably of any Enemy  with being in his Party  I therefore premise That by saying  I believe he will come  I do not imply that I desire he should I neither wish it for his own Sake or ours I do not wish it  for his own Sake  because as in a Quarrel with  GreatBritain  I cannot wish him Success so in some other of his Quarrels I know not how to wish him to be beaten What Infatuation has embark'd him in so scandalous a Quarrel as this against the King and Nation of  GreatBritain  God only knows I fear it looks like a Judgment from Heaven upon him for his entire Overthrow and Destruction  Ceasing then to pity him as a Brave and Heroick Prince I must while his Eyes are turn'd this Way look on him as an enrag'd Enemy and I speak of him as such  It is no Work of mine to enter here upon the Design of his Coming the Views upon which he has undertaken such a wild and unaccountable Attempt or the Persons in whose Cause he must seem to embark  if he makes the Attempt  I could spend many Pages on the Improbability of Success The Strength of the Government here the powerful Alliances the King is supported with from Abroad  the Poverty and Desperation of the King of  Sweden  's Circumstances Abroad  and the like  But as all these are  if he comes  to be disputed at the Muzzle of the Musket and the Point of the Sword talking of them in Paper will no way end the Dispute nor help our Troops  I am therefore turning my Eyes another way and looking upon our expecting People Our Business is to see if there be any Thing needful to be said to them This Part of my Discourse I shall form upon the Supposition  whether it shall be so or no  That the  Swedes  were now actually on Shore here to the Number of or Men or any Number what they please as their Partizans here threaten they will be  Some that know not the  Swedes  and think  Englishmen  are a kind of People that no body can look in the Face talk  Cavalierly  of it all and wish they were fairly on Shore that a fair Battel might decide it  For my Part I must own that tho' I cannot be so Phlegmatic as some are to be disheartned and discouraged at the very Thoughts of it and if it was to be put to a Day of Battel should have a good Hope of Success yet neither am I so Sanguine as to be fond of the Trial Battel is a terrible Crisis be it how it will And we have  no certain Word  tho' we have  a good Hope  to direct us to know what  the God of Battel may have determin'd about it I must therefore be of the Number of those who with a feeling Concern for the Miseries of their Native Countrey are ready to say we would not be glad by any Means to hear that an Army of  Swedes  or of any other Enemies were actually on Shore here  But while thus we are looking with an Eye of Expectance on these Events and that with some Impatience  it seems very necessary  that with all the Calmness and Composure I can I should cast in my Mite towards allaying the general Anxiety which I see upon the Minds of Men about this great Affair  This I cannot do upon any Foundation so well as upon a Supposition that they will really land upon us if they can And I think it is a very needful Question to put to one another as was by a certain Writer of those Times in Case of the Pretender  What if they should Come  There is no doubt but many who have a feeling Sense of the Calamities of War will say  What if he should Come  Why 'tis plain what will be the Case The Seat of a bloody War is fix'd in our own Countrey which hitherto we have blessed be God been deliver'd from and have only paid our Quota's and sent our Troops Abroad into other Countries where the Fields have been ravaged the People plundred Virgins ravished  Churches robb'd old and young murder'd▪ and the Fields cover'd with Blood This wil  be then brought home to our own Doors and we shall feel the Miseries which we have only hitherto talk'd of at a Distance As we have formerly pity'd the Desolations of  Europe  ▪ now they will all be at Liberty to pity us and we shall be the  Aceldama  of the World Another Thing will be the  Jacobite  Party will take Heart Rebellion revive and the Party of Men among us who so lately have been suppress'd will all fly to Arms again▪ and the Interest of the Pretender will be set on Foot with a Foreign Power to support it▪ the Consequence of which may be bloody and a terrible Civil War and for how long God only knows  This is making it look as dismal as we can well do and I am willing to talk of it thus▪ because the Enemy should not be able to say▪ I do not see it in a true Light  Also I would not appear insensible because I am not ignorant of the Calamities of a Coun+trey which is made the Seat of a War espe+cially of so bloody so inveterate a War as thi  may be and a War carry'd on with so much Animosity and perhaps Personal Rage as this may be if it comes to the length that these People persuade themselves it will The De+scription of a War between a Nation justly alarm'd in its own Defence and an enrag'd  revengful Party fir'd with the Reproaches of their late Defeat and enrag'd to the last Degree of Vengeance if they have Power and this Party now supported by a Foreign Enemy I say the  Description of such a War  is not easy nor can the Calamities that may attend it be well describ'd  For  First  To talk of it with Levity and without Concern would favour of the  Gascogne  and look like the Blusters of one that intended to have no Share in the Danger and perhaps none in the Loss such a Temper I care not to represent Or  Secondly  To talk of it with Anxiety and Concern is to discourage People from that vigorous Resolution to resist  to the Death  which is the undoubted Duty of every true Protestant who has any Concern for the Interest Safety Liberty and Deliverance of his Countrey  I shall therefore take the middle and just Method I shall give due Weight to the Invader the Goodness of his Troops the intrepid Courage of their King the Desperation of his Circumstances the Resolution they come hither with to Conquer or to Dye I am for allowing all these to be extraordinary and Things that are not to be laughed at or jested with and I only desire that every Man that thinks them fit to be laugh'd at may be oblig'd to be one of those that shall look them in the Face and if he can laugh at them he is welcome  I remember a Passage of the late King  James  the IId of which I was both Eye and EarWitness and  is as follows  When the King was expecting the Prince of  Orange  and preparing to put his Army in a Posture to receive him he order'd Eight Regiments of his Light Horse to be made Curiassiers and to be arm'd with  Back Breast  and  HeadPiece  as the  German  Curiassiers are and he appointed Three Regiments of them  viz  Of  Lanier Fenwick  and a Third whose Colonel I do not remember to pass in Review with their Armour on in St  George's Fields  where the King himself saw them perform their Exercise  He drew them up round him after he had review'd them that they might hear him speak and told them He was very well satisfied with their Appearance and did not doubt but they would behave themselves well when they came to Action that it was his Concern for their Safety that had caused him to order them to fight arm'd and withal to give them a Superiority in the Field and he added  I hope you will use your selves to them that they may not be tiresome to you in Service you will find the Advantage of them Gentlemen  said the King  I assure you the Troops we have to do with will not be afraid to show their Faces    He did not say this to discourage but to animate his Men and with the same Design I hope we may be allow'd to speak freely of the  Swedes  that they are  IronFac'd Fellows  that  will not turn their Backs for a Cut or two in their Flesh they are us'd to Blows and know how to dye in the Service of their King  But what then  So much the greater will be the Glory of the  British  Troops in Grappling with them What are they that we are not and what have they that we have not Nay how much greater are the Arguments our Men have to engage They fight in Duty and follow as they are led for Glory for Conquest and perhaps for Plunder we for Liberty Religion Estates Countries Wives and Children and in a word for all that can be dear to us as Men or as Christians  But I wave this Part 'tis fit for a Commander haranguing  as was the Custom of old Times  at the Head of his Troops a Trade as much out of Fashion  now  as it was useless and insignificant  then    My present Discourse is not directed to the Troops I make no doubt but they will do their Duty we have not so many  British  Cowards as some People may imagine but my present Business is with the civil quiet People at Home who however they are  civil  and  quiet  as I call them because of there being no Danger of their troubling us much with their  fighting  yet are apt enough to bear their share in doing Mischief and sometimes may have it more in their Power than such People should indeed be trusted with to weaken or  strengthen the Hands of those that do fight than any that are in the Action it self  And that I may tell those People their Business with Plainness  it is thus  in short If the Enemy Land let us have a care that we be not the Instruments of our own Discouragement that we do not weaken our own Hands and wound our own Helpers by our Weakness and want of Conduct at Home For this is certain That it is more in the Power of our own Folly to do harm to our own Cause and Interest than we may imagine and there are among us Men who may by their Ignorance do more Injury to the Cause of King  GEORGE  while they even fit at Home and seem to do nothing than the  Swedes  themselves would do by the Descent of an Army  We see these People vaunting and swaggering now of the Strength of the Nation the Alliances of the King the Weakness of the Enemy and the Cowardliness of the  Jacobite  Party and the like Very well Without enquiring whether they are right or wrong let them hold there where they are but let me caution that they be not  as is often the Case with such People  as unreasonably surpriz'd and discouraged afterwards as they are now without Judgment insulting and defying I remember some of the High People in  England  a little before the Revolution who laugh'd at the Prince of  Orange  and the  Dutch  and made them the Subject of their Mirth and Sport all  the while they were talk'd of and expected No body could shew any Concern about them at that Time but these Men upbraided them with Cowardize and a sneaking fainthearted Folly When the News came that they were put out to Sea but were driven back by a Storm the Company of these People was really not  bearable  if that Word be so no not among their own Friends Nothing troubled them but that the  Dutch  had not Landed and been gloriously beaten  and the like    Afterwards when they were actually Landed and Things began to look Threatning and Dangerous these were the Men who grew melancholy look'd dismally and in short many of them run quite away even before it came to a Crisis and never came back to  England  for some Years afterwards  There is a vast deal of Odds between not contemning an Enemy and not being afraid of him It was a Maxim of  Julius Caesar  Not to contemn his Enemies And all the World knows he was never a Man of Fear Let us give the  Swedes  their due Weight that we may prepare to match them and when they  do come  as People tell us  they will  let us take care not to be surprized at it  The Question is  What shall we do if they Come  And the Answer is as direct as the Question  Do We must Fight them  There is nothing else to be done with them nor is there any need to fear but we shall be well  able to do this They must be Fought with and that immediately  before  they have Time to rest and refresh themselves  before  they have Time to extend and spread themselves and open the Country to make way for Rebels Disaffected and  Jacobite  Rabbles to join with them and list in their Troops  Before  they can increase their own Numbers get a Footing in the Country or give Time for others to draw together and divert the King's Army  This must be done  with Vigor and immediate Application and it's our Duty that are not in the Field and are not immediately call'd out to Action to Encourage and Enliven those that are by the Chearfulness of our Countenances and the Readiness of our appearing on all Occasions to Support Supply Recruit and Assist the King his Government and Family with our Substance and with whatever necessary Sums may be wanting on such an Emergency as this To this Purpose one great part of our Duty who are in the Interest of King  GEORGE is this  and it is on this Account these Sheets are written  viz  not to discourage one another  And that I may speak plainly to the People that are more particularly concerned and tell you directly what I mean by discouraging one another I mean that cursed foolish and if I may so call it fatal Way we have of running down all Publick Credit and Publick Funds and Stocks upon the Surprize of such Things  as these as if we were Confederate with the Enemy in the Attempt upon our Country  I know nothing within my Observation more absurd and ridiculous than this Practice and yet I see no Disease among us harder to cure and the more because it is not always the meer Contrivance or Practice of the Enemies to the Government for if that were the Case some Measures ought to be taken and might be taken to prevent it But the very Friends to the Publick are found to be the Men soonest frighted and in their Fright doing most Mischief  If a HighChurchMan gets up  Bank  Bills and hurries them in for Payment musters up all his Party and Friends to run down Stocks and to sink Publick Credit we know his Design and the End of it But for the other People to take the Alarm and to see them blindly follow though their Enemies lead is preposterous and unanswerably weak  To what Purpose also is it that the Whigs do this And who are the Losers when they run to  ExchangeAlley  with their Stocks Funds Annuities  c  and sell them in a Fright Who do they Enrich and who are they that make a Prize of their Fears Are they not their Enemies the High Men who generally buy them up at the fallen Rate to which the Sellers own Fears have reduc'd them and then in a few Days fell them back again to the poor Desponding Creatures when  their Courage is a little reviv'd and their Spirits recover'd at perhaps Ten  per Cent  again  Exactly thus was the Case at the late Attempt for an Invasion in  Scotland  in the Name of the  Pretender  in Queen  ANNE  's Time of which I shall speak more largely by and by In the mean Time in order to prevent this Mischief on the like Surprize I would only recommend to those who are Friends to King  GEORGE  's Interest this one Consideration  viz  That this is the ONE and only Thing by which you can effectually Ruin your Country and betray King  GEORGE  into the Hands of his and your Enemies 'Tis pity indeed that the true Interest of the Nation should be so much at the Mercy of Mens Fears and that a Set of People who have such a sincere Affection to the King and his Interest as that there is no room to suspect them of an ill Design should be able to do so much Prejudice to the Cause they are embark'd in and be so unable to avoid it So just a Remark is it that Men in Danger who let Fear govern them run into their Danger rather than out of it Fear deprives Men of the Use of those Helps which Reason offers and Men in a Fright generally do themselves Harm by the Measures they take to do themselves Good  Let me turn this Advice to the Citizens of  London  in Particular O Ancient and Famous Metropolis the Mart of  Europe  and Magazine of the whole World as Immense in  Wealth as Innumerable in People Sumptuous in Buildings Rich even to Profusion in Furniture and Equipage Formidable in Wealth and justly esteemed beyond all the Cities in the World for Shipping Commerce Inhabitants and Credit  Of you it has been a happy Truth which has so seldom been contradicted that it almost became Proverbial That in all the Civil Broils of the Kingdom that Side which the City of  London  adher'd to always prevail'd And whence has this proceeded but from the hearty generous and bold Advances your Citizens made as well in raising Men furnishing Armies and Navies with Provisions Arms Necessaries  c  for the War as particularly supporting by your Credit and Cash the Party you espoused in a Manner and with a Zeal peculiar to your immense Riches and inimitable by any other part of this Kingdom  In the Times of the late Confusions in the Reign of King  Charles  the Courage and Unanimity of your City in concurring with the Parliament gave them such eminent Advantages as well in levying Armies fitting Fleets as supplying those Armies and Fleets and their Leaders with great Sums of Money on all Emergencies as was the chief if not at some times the only Support of that War and in the End gave to the said Parliament that manifest  Superiority over the King's Party as finally ended in the Overthrow of all his Majesty's Measures and made the Parliament to whom you so constantly adhered invincible  Your Money restor'd their Circumstances your Numbers recruited their Troops your Steadiness and constant Adherence to them made them  Antaeus  like rise up from every Fall stronger than they were before  It cannot now be said that your Affection to King  GEORGE  and his Interest is less than that of your Forefathers was for the Parliament Side in a Civil War your Wealth Opulence Commerce Manufactures and especially your Numbers are visibly and remarkably greater than ever  With you are found those immense Sums of Money which are no where else in the World so much as heard of they are your Citizens who when Two or Three Millions  Sterling  are wanted to any inviting Proposal frequently fill up the Subscriptions in Two or Three Hours and are ready to tread one another to Death to bring in their Money  You give the Standard to our Wealth and it is the Glut of Money within your Walls that gives Reason to the Parliament to reduce the Interest of Money through the whole Nation Your Banks are the Center of the running Cash as the Stocks of your Companies are the Fund of Credit and Commerce Money flows  Annually from these as from a Fountain diffusing it self like the Blood through the Veins not of your City alone but of the whole Kingdom  Your growing Wealth and the Rise of Families within your Walls exceeds the Imagination much more the Description of the nicest Calculators The Nobility and the Gentry of  Britain  by well managing Hereditary Estates improving their Revenues intermarrying with flowing Fortunes  c  maintain the Lustre of Antient Families and sometimes grow up to great Magnitude upon the Ruins and Decay of one another But in you the greatest Fortunes are raised by Industry and Application from the smallest Beginnings nay from meer Air and in a word from nothing at all shewing that  an Estate indeed is a Pond  but Trade is a Spring the one may contain its own Waters within its firm and faithful Banks but the other is an inexhaustible Flux of Wealth that knows no Decrease but overflows its Banks and enriches continually its adjacent Parts with its plentiful Streams  Hence the most flourishing Families of the Nobility think it now not below them to search the opulent Families of the  London  Merchants to find immense Fortunes for their Eldest Sons by whose Treasures the Mortgag'd Estates of their Ancestors are redeem'd and the Daughters of our Citizens never fail to become  a Coronet at the Coronations of our Queens  But why do we talk of these Things 'Tis to Thee our Princes apply for weighty Loans upon the Emergencies of State nor can the Demands of the Nation be so great but thou art able to supply them at the shortest Warning 'Tis thy Credit adds Currency to the Royal  Exchequer  whose Bills are brought to thy  Bank  to give them Life and which visibly stagnated in their own Worth notwithstanding their high Interest till they receiv'd a new Circulation at thy Hands  Even the Imperial  Exchequer  flies to thy unfathomable Wealth for its Supply and Mortgages Nations to Thee for thy Money Nay is not the whole Nation Mortgaged to thee at this Time and of Fifty Millions  Sterling  which the Government is now in Debt and for which the whole Island is Burthened with Taxes to discharge is not the Gross of the Money thine and is not the Value of the Interests and Properties governed at thy Pleasure  Where shall we go to match the Wealth of thy Inhabitants and what City or Nation is there in the World that we can describe thee by  Let us bring back all this to the present Case While this City stands while this Wealth circulates while this Credit supports it self  and the Spirit and Courage of the Citizens of  London  hold up no Invasion no desperate Attempt of Foreign Kings or Domestick Rebels can affect us  What Madness then must possess the Minds of the Citizens of  London  that in Case of any Publick Dangers or the View of Publick Disorders shall instead of bold Declarations to stand by their Sovereign and to support one another to the last fall immediately to stabbing and wounding the Vitals of their own Credit running every one to the  Baenk  for their Money to the Markets with their Stocks as if all was lost and they were every one to shift for themselves Like Sailors in a Ship who while the Ship swims and the Masts stand assist one another and look well to the Main but when she strikes upon a Rock and is visibly splitting then every Man prepares to swim and save his own Life But to carry this Simile home if Men frighted with their own Shadows abandon the Conduct of the Ship while she is sound and has suffer'd no Damage they ruin themselves and are the only Cause of the Loss of the Ship  What can be the Condition of the Citizens of  London  that they should suffer themselves to be terrify'd and disorder'd at the Shadow of Enemies while they are yet at a Distance And why should they take this fatal Way of expressing their Apprehensions which not only  weakens their own Hands but gives inexpressible Room of Boasting and Triumph to their Enemies not making only but increasing the Terror and vain Apprehensions and besides all making their Market  What an Example had we of this Practice at the Attempt of the Pretender in the late Queen's Time to land in  Scotland  It was then but too evident that had the Pretender landed tho' at that Time the Disaffection was not reckon'd so dangerous as it has been since yet the very Stop of the  Bank  the Run upon Stocks and the Ruin of the Publick Credit were such as in Two or Three Days had it continu'd would have put all the Nation into an inexpressible Confusion It is true it was begun by the  Jacobite  Party who were Enemies but the timerous Party of the Whigs who were Friends to the Government took the Fright and like Men in a Ship who begin to strip that they may swim put the rest immediately into the same Confusion too It was then all the Stocks and Funds sunk in Value the Run upon the  Bank  was such that had the Pretender landed tho' he had been beaten afterwards yet it is certain the  Bank  must have stopp'd Payment and every Thing was running into Distraction  This is the Folly I would arm the Citizens against as the only Injury they can do themselves and as the great Discouragement to the  whole Nation If the  Swedes  should land the  Jacobites  arm the Troops draw together to fight is that a Time to shew our selves uneasy to fly to the Publick Funds and Places of Receipt to take in our Money What is that less or more than to say we look upon all as lost and are willing to shift for our selves  And how scandalous is this to a City of that Magnitude Wealth and Grandeur not to say Pride as the City of  London  Did our Fathers do this when the Royal Army was marching up victorious from  Oxford  after some Advantage in the Field and very few to oppose them and the King at the Head of his Army was come up to  Brentford  when as it was said some even of the Members of the House of Commons were secretly fled and the Cause was upon the Point of being given up What did the City They raised new Troops sent out their Regiments of Auxiliaries march'd out in Person and encourag'd the Troops so much by their Example that the King's Army receiv'd a Check at  Brentford  and durst make no further Attempt  Did the City behave then in a Cause so disputable and at best so inferior to this now before us and shall we be all in an Alarm and run down our publick Credit and publick Stocks and amass our Money into our own Hands as if we were packing up our All to be gone For shame O ye Citizens of  London  who value  you selves upon your Sense of the  Revolution  exemplify'd in King  GEORGE  's Succession be not thus the Destroyers of your selves  How scandalous is it that your Stocks should fall and your Credit seem to decline already even upon the Notion of this remote Invasion a Thing which may be or may not be and which it is Two to One now whether it be not already defeated and disappointed What can the meaning of this be Why is your Credit in the City worse if the King of  Sweden  were actually on Shore than it is now Is there any Doubt but he must be beaten Is it possible we can be so dispirited as to fear King  GEORGE  's being dethron'd and if there is no Danger of that Why are our Publick Funds less worth And if that should be What are you and all your Funds good for So that on the whole your only Step is to keep up the Credit keep up your Esteem of all publick Matters for by that you keep up the Value of your own Estates keep up the Courages of all your Friends and do more to disappoint and discourage your Enemies than Ten Thousand Men extraordinary could do in the Field  For it's plain one great Expectation of the Tories in the Beginning of their Success is That we shall be all in an Amaze that Stocks will run down the  Bank  stop Payment and  the Citizens shew themselves in a Fright than which nothing can be a greater Mark of a general Confusion and Discouragement  While I am talking thus to the Citizens who know these Things I need say no more to shew them the Folly of this unhappy Conduct they know very well how many ill Consequences it is attended with and how many Ways it is serviceable to the Enemy  But perhaps some may answer We acknowledge the Fact but which way is it possible to prevent it Every one have their own Fears aand their own Apprehensions and Thousands are in Circumstances which render them more subject than ordinary to such Apprehensions having little or nothing else to depend upon but what are in such publick Hands and being afraid to have the Rate of Things fall farther they therefore sell off and hasten the Fall farther by increasing the Fright  These Things may be true in some Particulars but cannot hold good in the general and there may be many useful Things offered to the Persons concerned to prevent such a Confusion as is the usual Consequence in these Cases and had such Measures been taken in former Times the little malicious Runs upon Stocks and Banks had not happened  Upon the first Appearance of any such Disorder all that are Friends to the present Government that value the Credit of the City  and see the Usefulness of keeping up the Courage of the People to the common Interest will if they have any Regard to that Interest stand together with their Fortunes and Stock of Cash and support the Credit of the  Bank  And to encourage them in this Work the Names of all such Citizens who having Money in the  Bank  forbear to call it out or who carry any Money in to the Assistance of the  Bank  at such a Time of Exigence should be taken down in order to be laid before the Parliament and in order to have them publickly known that the Government may on all Occasions make such Acknowledgment to them and reward them in such a Manner as so generous a Conduct shall deserve  That on the contrary the Names of all those Bankers Merchants or whatever other Persons that shall be found making large Demands on the  Bank  at such a Time as that should be taken down and laid also before the Parliament that they might be known mark'd out and due Notice taken of them as there should be Occasion  At such a Time as this it would seem an acceptable Service for the Citizens on such Occasions as may offer to subscribe large Advances of Money upon such publick Securities as the Parliament may offer that it may be seen the City are neither doubtful or discouraged  in Defence of King  GEORGE  and his Interest  These are Steps fitter and more becoming the Zealous and Loyal City of  London  than the Confusions occasion'd by running down their own Credit and lessening the Value of their own Estates as if all was in a Fright and the Nation in Danger of being lost And I am free to say such a Step as this would go farther to the conquering of the King of  Sweden  and discouraging the  Jacobites  from joining them or from appearing together in order to encourage and support the  Swedes  than the raising Ten Thousand Men to join the Army would do  I could propose many noble Things such a City as this could do upon so eminent an Occasion as this But I know none that can come up to this Let the  Jacobites  see the  Bank  supported by the Money'dMen see the Stocks rise  per Cent  the very Day they hear of the King of  Sweden  's Coming and the City advancing Two Millions to the Government upon new Funds and then let us but observe their Countenances Such a Step would as effectually dishearten and disappoint them as beating the  Swedish  Fleet before they landed would do I take upon me to say that in case such a Thing as a  Swedish  Invasion is projected and a Rebellion at the End of it the Dependance of the Enemy is as much  upon the Confusions and Disorders such Things usually make among the People in  London  by the Stop of Credit the Fall of Stocks and the like as upon beating the Forces nay and more too for this is the Thing by which they expect to discourage the Friends of the Government and hearten and encourage their own Party to take Arms And indeed what can raise Tumults and Disorders sooner than a Stagnation of Credit a Stop of Cash an Interruption of Trade and a general Face of Fright and Terror upon the King's Friends  Is this the Way to beat the  Swedes  Or is it the Way to cause a despicable Enemy to ruin us while they themselves are out of GunShot Is it possible that our Enemies through the Infirmity of our Friends should have found out a newinvented Engine to wound a whole Nation at a Blow that kills while the Person hurting is entirely out of Sight and out of Reach and cannot have the Wound return'd Is not this to make them fancy to themselves that Heaven is fighting for them as it did once for King  Jehosaphat  ▪ and that we are as the Children of  Ammon  and Mount  Seir  who are killing one another for fear without any Reason but by an Infatuation from Heaven  Certainly it is an Infatuation that there is no Room to dispute Whether it be from Heaven or not Let the Casuists and Divines answer that But for Men who otherwise as it has already appear'd have been able by their Figure their Wealth and their Reputation to support their Princes and keep up the Spirits of the Nation in a War against the mightiest Nations of the World and to make such Efforts in Matters of Money which have been the Surprize of  Europe  I say  for these  if a despicable Handful of but Seven Thousand Men for it was no more the  Pretender  had with him or of Fourteen Thousand for it is no more the  Swedes  have threatned us with should but Land upon their Country for these to be discourag'd and despairing and run to the  Bank  for their Money and to  ExchangeAlley  to sell their Stocks for what they can get as if every Man was making up his Pack to fly or Shipping off to be out of Danger is not this an Infatuation Can any Rational Account be given for it O Citizens O  Englishmen  remember a little your own Circumstances nothing but a little Steadiness under all these Things is wanting to make you the most formidable People in the World while this foolish Temper makes you a Terror to your selves and the Scorn and LaughingStock of your Enemies  I have been told by those who say they know it very well that when the Citizens of  London  were in that terrible Fright at about Twenty Two Sail of Ships though Twenty Eight were at the Heels of them and Seven Thousand Men though the whole Nation was ready to Arm against them I say I have been told that when they sold their Stocks at  per Cent  less than they cost them and had the  Pretender  Landed would have sold them for any Thing they could get it was the Tory Party that bought them And that in less than a Fortnight their Fright being over they bought them back again from the Tories for the old Price again So that as was said the Tories got Two Hundred Thousand Pounds by the needless Fright the Whigs were in and all this in less than Twenty Days Time and laugh'd at them into the Bargain Was there any Thing but Madness and Infatuation in all this  If you would not be thus dup'd and let into the Secret again if you have any Regard to the Cause you are embark'd in and to King  GEORGE  who is ready to stand by you and merits that you should better stand by Him than by such Conduct as this you can be suppos'd to do  Be wiser  shew more Steddiness more Resolution more Sense of the Nature and Consequence of the Things before you In short remember your Vows to  King  GEORGE  your Engagements to support and assist him Is this assisting him Or is it assisting his Enemies Cowardice is Treason in its Nature though not in its Design and a Coward is as ill used in an Army as a Traytor though not for the same Reason And what is this but Cowardice and that of the worst Kind for it is a Pannick that seizes you while your Enemy is afar off and that of so fatal a Nature that it does as it were open the Door to him and invite him to come in nay which is worse it encourages Traytors at Home to open the Door and assist to let them in  It makes the Enemy appear as if they were more formidable than really they are and gives them a Triumph even without a Victory Do you think they do not stand and laugh on such Occasions to see the Citizens crowd down  GrocersAlley  to the  Bank  and come back hugging their Money as if they had just snatch'd it out of the Fire or sav'd it from a Shipwreck Is this like the Citizens of  Carthage  where the Ladies cut off their Hair which was then the greatest Ornament of Beauty and willingly gave it to make Cordage and Ropes for the Rigging out their Navy against the  Romans  Or is it rather like the Citizens of  Constantinople  who pleaded Poverty with their Emperor when he begg'd of them from Door to Door to contribute Money to hire Troops  to defend their City and had immense Treasures laid up in their Coffers for the Plunder of the  Turks  Let these ignominions Sights be seen no more among us But if you would strike Terror into the  Swedes  if you would convince your Enemies that King  GEORGE  is Invulnerable while he has such a City and such Citizens to stand by him Let it be seen by your Conduct in Times of Danger for then indeed is the Time to shew the Sincerity of your former Vows and the Weight of all your Addresses  What do all our Addresses and Associations amount to if in a Time of Difficulty you abandon your selves to needless Fears and suffer Rumours and Shams raised by your Enemies to make an Impression upon you in this most sensible Part  And now I have mention'd  Associations  Things which I confess I have not seen so much Benefit arise from as has been expected  I do not mean now only  but even formerly too I say since I have named the Word ASSOCIATION I cannot but put my Fellow Citizens in mind of it how they may  Associate  NOW more to their own Honour and to the Interest of the King and the whole Nation  than ever  they or perhaps any City in the World had an Opportunity to do before For if the Citizens of  London  would  Associate now  as they ought to do I affirm it is in their Power to form such an  Association  at this Time or at any Time of publick Danger as would fright the most Potent Enemy in  Europe  from ever making any Attempt to disturb the Peace of  Great Britain    This would be by a general Association of the Money'd Men to stand together and assist one another with their utmost Strength of Money and Credit to support the Credit of the Publick Stocks to maintain the Currency and Honour of the  Bank  and to prevent any Possibility of the Enemy making a Run or Push as they call it upon the  Bank  to the Stop of their Cash or hindring the Circulation of their current Bills  In virtue of this Association the Subscribers should agree and oblige themselves not to draw any Money out or transfer any of their Stock from the  Bank  at an Under or Falling Price for such and such a Time or during any such Time of Publick Apprehensions of Danger  They should on the other Hand raise a Capital Subscription of Seven Eight or Ten Millions  Sterling  to support the said Credit of the  Bank  as well by buying up all the Stock of such as through Malice or real Ignorance and Apprehensions shall offer to sell the same at any Price not exceeding Five  per Cent  under the current Price of the  Bank  Stock as it  was at the Time when those Apprehensions and Fears began  That they will out of the said Stock Subscribed enable the  Bank  to advance any Sum of Money upon such Security and such moderate Interest as the Parliament shall appoint for His Majesty's present Occasions as readily and chearfully as in Time of Freedom from Danger and of general Tranquility  Time and the narrow Extent of this small Tract will not permit me to enter into an Enquiry what a Glory such a Transaction as this would bring not to the Reign of King  GEORGE  only but to the Memory of such Subjects and such a City through the whole World Were such an Association entred into and bravely supported  Jacobitism  would quickly learn to Despair her Advocates would forsake her Foreign Princes would cease to think of helping her they that hope now for our Confusions would give it over and the Spirit of Rebellion would evaporate die in its own Vapour and sink out of the Nation  'Tis from a true and distinguish'd Zeal for the Prosperity and Glory of the City of  London  the Safety of the King's Government and the Peace of the whole Nation that the Author of these Sheets has made these Thoughts Publick and as he never entertain'd a Thought or wish'd in Prejudice of the Protestant  Succession of  Hanover  or in Favour of King  GEORGE  's Enemies so he wishes this may be received accepted and practised SO as that the Government may receive the Advantage and he may have the Satisfaction of having thus seasonably made the Proposal which is all the Honour and all the Reward he desires  Such a Method as this would so strengthen the Hands of King  GEORGE  so encourage His Friends and faithful Subjects so establish His Interest and secure His Possession that we should for the future have on one Side less Occasion and on the other less Anxiety about the keeping or not keeping Standing Forces on Foot on these or any other Occasions  And now I have mention'd that so often disputed Point a Standing Army a Question which lies in less Compass than the many Words which have been made on one Side or other would make us believe I shall in a few Words give a State of the Case and therewith conclude  Of a Standing ARMY  THE word  Standing Army  appears in several Shapes but ought as it is esteemed a Grievance to be understood only thus  Viz  A Standing Army maintained in Time of Peace  It remains to state What is or is not a Time of Peace And to the present Case it is sufficient to say that a Time of a threatned Invasion unconquer'd Disaffection and formidable Faction is not a Time of Peace and that therefore in those Cases the Word Standing Army is out of the Question  But when Alliances and Treaties Pacifications and Accommodations Guarantees and such like Things have dissipated all our just Fears from Abroad and Rebellion Faction and Disaffection is suppress'd and disarm'd at Home then indeed the Nation may be said to be in Peace and a Standing Army may be called a Grievance  But as even then some Forces are necessary to be kept up and are kept up by all Nations to secure and preserve that State of Peace which alone makes a Standing Army needful at other Times The only Question then lies What is or is not a necessary  Medium  between the Extremes What Number of Troops  may be acquiesc'd in as necessary for the publick Safety and what shall be esteemed dangerous to the Nation's Liberty  The Answer to this is short and easy and was long ago discuss'd in Answer to a Tract published against King  William  's Army at the Time of the Peace of  Ryswick    Viz  That the Parliament are and ought to be the Judges in the Case That such a Force as the Parliament shall judge needful and that Force being always subjected to Parliamentary Authority as to their Continuance Increase and Decrease such a Force and no other the Nation will always be easy with and safe in And such a Standing Army is not inconsistent with the Constitution of a  Free Nation  Of this Opinion the Author of these Sheets ever was and as he never saw any solid Reasons against it so he never wrote one Word inconsistent with it in his Life  There needs but one Word to add to this and that is That we have all the Reason in the World to believe His Majesty will always be satisfy'd with such a Settlement of Force notwithstanding the Schemes of our projecting Authors for formidable Forces at Home and Nurseries of Forces Abroad in which it's very reasonable to think they have no Direction from the King And this I gather from the last Words of his Majesty's Speech the  most engaging in this very Particular that could be spoken from a Glorious Prince to a Loyal People as follows  My Lords and Gentleman  I have an Entire Confidence in You and have therefore nothing to ask but that You would take such Measures as will best secure your Religion and Liberties While You preserve these  c  I shall sit Safe and Easy on my Throne  FINIS
