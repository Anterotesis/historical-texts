 THE CAUSE OF THE DELUGE DEMONSTRATED  BEFORE I proceed to my present  Demonstration of the Cause of the Deluge  I must premise this That in my  New Theory of the Earth  especially as improv'd  nd corrected in the Second Edition I have evi  ently shewn that in Case a Comet pass'd by be  re the Earth in its annual Course on the  th  Day of the Second Month from the Autumnal Equinox or  Nov  in the  th  Year before the Christian Aera the Phaenomena of Nature and History and particularly the  Mosaic  Account of the Deluge of  Noah  which are no otherwise to be ac  ounted for are exactly explain'd that the Calcu  ations and Proportions whereever we can come  them are on that Hypothesis right agreeable to  another to Ancient especially Sacred History  nd to the System of Astronomy that there are Tra  s in Ancient Books of a Tradition that a Comet  id appear at the very Beginning of the Deluge  at the very Month and Day mentioned by  Moses  such its Beginning is attested to by other Old  ecords and on this Hypothesis by Astronomical  alculations also whence I concluded that it was  most highly probable or rather physically demonstrable that a Comet did pass by at that time and was under the Conduct of the Divine Providence and as his Instrument in punishing a wicked World the Cause of that Deluge The only thing wanting was to demonstrate from the Period of some Comet and its Situation in the Heavens Astronomically stated and computed that such a Comet did actually come by at that very time which if it could be once shewn the whole must be own'd as certain and demonstrated and all the natural Corollaries therefrom must be allow'd as true even by the Obstinate and Incredulous This indeed at first was look'd upon by me as not at all to be expected since we then barely began to know or rather strongly to conjecture that Comets did revolve about the Sun in settled Periods but without being able to determine any one of those Periods But of late God has so bless'd the Labours of the Learned and this Part of Astronomy is so much improv'd especially by the farther Pains and Observations of the great Inventor himself Sir  Isaac Newton  whose Name will never be forgotten while Mathematicks and Astronomy are preserved among Mankind and by the laborious Calculations of the acute Dr  Halley  on the Principles laid down by the former that what was a few Years ago almost despair'd of is now in great Measure discover'd and we know not only that one Comet has come round three or four times already in later Ages  viz  AD and and will no doubt come round again  AD  as making its Period in about Years that another has probably come round in the same later Ages twice already  viz AD  and and so is to return  A D  or as making its Period in about Years But which is the greatest Discovery of all that the last most remarkable Comet  whose Descent into our Regions has occasion'd almost all the modern solid Knowledge we have relating to the whole Cometick System it self has also several times been seen already within the time of certain Records I mean in the  th  Year before Christ and again  AD  or and yet again  AD  besides this its last Appearance  AD  whereby we know that it revolves in about Years This last Comet I may well call the  most remarkable one  that ever appear'd since besides the former Consideration I shall presently shew that it is no other than that very Comet which came by the Earth at the Beginning of  Noah  's Deluge and which was the Cause of the same Now considering the Premises I shall only have occasion in order to my present Design to prove these five Things concerning it That no other of the known Comets could pass by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge That this Comet was of the same Bigness with that which pass'd by at that time That its Orbit was then in a due Position to pass by at that Time That its descending Node was then also in a due Position for the same Passage by That its Period exactly agrees to the same time Or in short that all the known Circumstances of this Comet do correspond and that it actually pass'd by on or about that very Year and on or about that very Day of the Year when the Deluge began All which Things I shall demonstrate in their Order  I None of the other Comets yet known I mean of the in Dr  Halley  's Table and my  Solar System  could be that which pass'd by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge This appears by these certain Arguments following  None of them appear to have been of a due Bigness For the Phaenomena of the Deluge as I  New Theor  d Edit  Co      Lem      p    have elsewhere shew'd require a small one in Comparison of the Earth whereas the rest of the Comets seem to have been commonly larger than it  None of their descending Orbits are duly situate I mean between and Degrees from  Aries  which Position is yet absolutely necessary in this Case For the Precession of the Equinox which is about Degrees added to the Degrees that the Earth was distant from  Aries  when the Flood began must suppose the descending Orbit of the Comet to be now between and Degrees from  Aries  at which place none of the descending Orbits of the other Comets are now situate as Dr  Halley  's Table and my Solar System grounded thereon will readily shew None of the other's Nodes are so situate as is necessary to bring the Comet near enough to our Earth I mean between or Degrees from  Aries  and so as to cross the Plane of the Ecliptick very near to the Distance of the Earth from the Sun as is also plain from the same Table and System Nay indeed the wrong Situation of the descending Orbits noted under the last Head renders this due Situation of the Nodes plainly impossible For it being necessary that the Orbit it self intersect the Ecliptick it self in the  th  Degree of  Taurus  this cannot possibly be in such a Situation of the Orbit as that we have already mention'd to belong to all the rest of the known Comets So that these other Comets were utterly incapable of being instrumental in the Deluge even tho their Periods should any of them agree which yet we know not that any of them do  II This Comet was of the same Bigness with that which pass'd by at that time I mean a very small one and only times as large as the Moon  Ʋ  This appears by Mr  Flamsteed  's Determination of its apparent Diameter about ″ when it was nearly  as far off as the Sun whereas he supposes that of the Moon at the same Distance to be about ″ So that if due Allowance be made for that large and dense Part of the Atmosphere which hides the Nucleus or Comet it self from us suppose ″ the Diameter of the solid Body it self will be only ″ Now the Cube of or is to the Cube of or as about to Whence it appears that this Comet is about ten times so great as the Moon or ¼ so great as the Earth as the real Comet that occasion'd the Deluge ought to be  III The descending Part of the Orbit of this Comet was about the  th  deg of  Taurus  at the Time of the Deluge as that of the Comet at the Deluge must have been For this descending Orbit is now in the  d  Degree of  Cancer  and if we allow Degrees for its apparent Motion since the Deluge which is very little different from the real Precession of the Equinox the main if not only Occasion of it it will appear to have been in the  th  Degree of  Taurus  at that Time according to the foregoing Computation  IV The Descending Node of this Comet which is of the greatest Consideration here and liable to the greatest Variety of all does also exceeding well agree in the present Case For this is now in the  d  Degree of  Cancer  and if we allow as before Degrees for its apparent Motion since the Deluge or for the real Precession of the Equinox the main if not only Cause of it it will appear to have been in the  th  of  Taurus  at that Time also Nay if we allow the least Inequality in these two Motions or the least Alteration of the Planes either of the Ecliptick or of the Comets Orbit or of both as we justly may both from the Physical Causes and Astronomical Observations we may suppose them still nearer the Earth's Distance from the Sun and so more exactly suitable to the Case of the Deluge  V The Period of this Comet most exactly agrees to the same Time I mean to Revolutions in Years the Interval from the Deluge till its last Appearance  cip      For as Sir  Isaac Newton  first observ'd from its Elliptick Curvature before it disappear'd that its Period must be in general above Years so has he and Dr  Halley  since observ'd that the same Comet has been seen four times  viz  the  th  Year before Christ  AD  or  AD  and  AD  and that by consequence it makes a Revolution in about Years Now if we make a very small Allowance for the old Periods before Christ and suppose that one with another it has revolv'd in ½ Years we shall find that such Periods amount to Years exactly according to that Number since the Deluge This is so remarkable an Observation and so surprizing that it will deserve a particular Demonstration from the original Authors themselves To begin then with the first of the Appearances recorded in later History I mean that in the  th  Year before Christ the Year that  Julius Caesar  was slain  en Nat  I V  C    H  st Nat  II C    we have no fewer nor lesser Persons than  Seneca Suetonius Plutarch  and  Pliny  to attest it and the last as bringing  Augustus  's own Words for his Voucher Take the Account in those Words as being the most authentick and remarkable  'On those very Days says  Augustus  when I was exhibiting some Games to the People begun about  Sept  a Comet appear'd for Days and was seen in the  Northern  Part of Heaven It rose about the  th  Hour of the Day It was a remarkable one and visible all over the World The common People believ'd that it signify'd the Reception of the Soul of  Caesar  into the Number of the immortal Gods On which Account the Image of this Star was added to that Statue representing  Caesar  's Head which we a while after consecrated  in the Forum'  Accordingly it is known that some of  Caesar  's Coins have a Star upon them for a Memorial of this Comet and observable that  Virgil  hints at the same also  Aeneid  VIII  Patrium aperitur v  rtice sidus Plutarch  's  Seneca  's and  Suetonius  's Words are almost the very same that are included in the Passage from  Augustus  and so need not be distinctly set down Only the Time of its Rising is by  Suetonius  set down  about the    th Hour  without the Words  of the Day  which the other two have and its  Northern  Position is only mentioned by  Augustus  himself Now if we interpret the  th  Hour or  th  Hour of the Day to be either a clock before Noon or an Hour before Sunset this will render the whole almost incredible it being next to impossible that this Comet should be seen in the Daytime But the  Romans  then accounting Midnight the Beginning of their Day as is well known by Chronologers we may reckon this  th  Hour to be at Night and all will agree to the Comet before us and it will shew that as it had been conceal'd by cloudy Weather for some time so it now appear'd ascending from the Sun with its long and splendid Tail for a Week before the like cloudy Weather or the Comet's too great Remoteness rendred it no longer observable Accordingly the  Northern  Position of this Comet noted here by  Augustus  secures us still farther that it must have been the same with that  AD  which is ever in the same Position at the same Place of its Orbit to say nothing of its remarkable Brightness which I take to belong to its Tail and which rendred it so very remarkable then in the World In which Point it as well or better agrees with this than with any other in the whole Cometary System So that on all these Accounts the Comet seen then by the  Romans  and that seen  AD  must have been one and the same Comet The next Period  when this Comet might be seen again according to the foregoing Time of its Revolution was  AD  or When yet we hear nothing of it in  Hevelius  's History of Comets But then we have it in  Lubienietz  's more exact Catalogue out of  Zonaras  the Original Historian whose Words are these Annal L xiv p  'In the  th  Year of the Emperor  Justinian    AD  or a Comet appear'd of that Sort which is called  Lampadias  It sent its bright Tail upward and continued to shine Days'  Which Words exactly agree to this Comet The next Period when it was to be expected was  AD  at which Time the Historians are full of their Accounts of it Take those Accounts in their own Words as they stand in  Hevelius  and  Lubienietz  who have given us a most compleat Collection of them in their Histories of Comets  vath ex    ex    AD  We saw a Comet of wonderful Brightness from the first Week in  Lent  until the Passion of our Lord An extraordinary Star was seen to shine this Year on  Friday  in the Evening  Southward  and  Westward  and appeared bright for Days together and always at the same Hour  AD  in the Month of  February  two Days after the New Moon a great Comet appear'd  SouthWestward      gebert  AD  a Comet appear'd like a Fire almost all the Month of  February  A very great Comet was seen in the Time of  Lent Praetorius  adds that the Emperor  Henry  IV died the same Year which  Calvisius  also agrees to  AD  a Star which we call a Comet appear'd  AD  a dreadful Comet appear'd from the first Week in  Lent  till the Vigil of  PalmSunday  The same Year the Emperor  Henry  IV died  On the Year of our Lord the  th  of the Calends of  March    Feb  a certain strange Star  was discovered and was seen to shine between the  South  and  West  for Days after the same manner and at the same Hour It seemed to be small and obscure but that Light which went out from it was exceeding bright and a Splendor like a great Beam proceeded from the  East  and  North  and shot it self upon the same Star  In these Testimonies we may see that all the Circumstances of this Comet agree to that of  AD  I mean the Smallness and Obscurity of its Nucleus the Brightness and Remarkableness of its Tail its Position  SouthWest  and the Direction of its Tail  NorthEast  So that there is no Reason  doubt but it was the very same Only we must here note that these two Periods were one with another three Quarters of a Year shorter  han the last Period For from  September  in the    th  Year before Christ till  February  or  March A D  are but ½ Years or two Periods of  ¼ apiece one with another whereas from  he same  February  or  March  AD till  Febru  y  or  March  when this Comet was about  same Position again there are just Years  is rather a Wonder that the three last Periods  our Famous Comet are so very nearly equal  an that there is this small Inequality among  em Nor is it by the way any Wonder there  re that the four first Periods after the Deluge are  be suppos'd one with another rather above  ears to agree exactly to that Time 'Tis rather  Question whether the rest of the Comets Periods  ill prove any of them near so equal in Proportion  even that Allowance makes these to be Accord  gly Sir  Isaac Newton  and Dr  Halley  rightly observe  Princip  p  Praelect Physico Math  p  at these Cometary Orbits are the most easily  sensibly disturb'd by the occasional Nearness of  eir Comets to other Bodies of all others and so  considerable Inequalities are to be expected among them  Note  That it is highly remarkable that this is the only Comet yet known whose Node renders it capable of approaching very near the Body of the Earth and that the same Node is still so little remote from the Earth's Orbit as Dr  Halley  well observes that it brought this Comet about as near to the same as the Moon this very last time Hear his remarkable Words and consider the Consequence of them in this Matter  Synops Comet in calce  'No Comet says he has hitherto threatned the Earth with a nearer Appulse than that of For by Calculation I find that  November    th    h  ′ after Noon that Comet was not above a Semidiameter of the Sun which I take to be equal to the Distance of the Moon to the  Northwards  of the Way of the Earth At which time had the Earth been there the Comet would I think have had a Parallax equal to that of the Moon'  Nor can I pass over his following Words without setting them down they are so apposite to my present Purpose  'The former Observations says he are to be suppos'd as spoken to Astronomers But what might be the Consequences of so near an Appulse or of a Contact or lastly of a Collision of these celestial Bodies which are none of them impossible I leave to be discuss'd by the Philosophers'  Since this Comet's Period is Years its middle Distance must be about Miles from the Sun its longer Axis and greatest Distance twice so long or nearly Miles its Aphelion Distance about times as great as the Distance of  Saturn  its greatest Distance to its least as above to and so its greatest Light and Heat to its least as above to  Since Years appears to be the Period of the Comet that caus'd the Deluge what a learned Friend of mine who was the Occasion of my Examination of this Matter suggests will deserve to be considered  viz  Whether the Story of  he Phoenix that celebrated Emblem of the Resurrection in Christian Antiquity that it returns once after Centuries and goes to the Altar and City of  he Sun and is there burnt and another arises out of its Ashes and carries away the Remains of the former c be not an Allegorical Representation of this Comet which returns once after Centuries and goes down to the Sun and is there vehemently heated and its outward Regions dissolv'd yet that it flies off again and carries away what remains after that terrible burning c and whether the Conflagration and Renovation of  hings which some such Comet in its Ascent from  e Sun may bring upon the Earth be not hereby  refigur'd I will not here be positive but I own  hat I don't know of any Solution of this famous Piece of  Egyptian  Mythology and Hieroglyphicks  this seems to be that can be compared with it  Note  That none of those Comets whose Or  its are yet known can come near enough to our Earth in their Ascent from the Sun to cause the Conflagration This is evident to those who con  der Dr  Halley  's Table or my Solar System built  pon it since none of them move in or very near  he Plane of the Ecliptick and those four which  ave their Nodes nearest the Earth's Orbit and so might approach nearest to the Earth are either  ch as have these Nodes so near only in their De  ent to the Sun as that in and that in  nd that in or go not any time much near  to the Sun than the Earth it self as that in  nd so are on all Accounts utterly incapable of affording  Heat enough for such a Conflagration  Note That therefore the Period of Time for that Conflagration upon the Supposition that it is to be caused by a Comet cannot now be discover'd by any natural Means but must still remain as formerly only knowable from Divine Revelation  New Theory  p      Note That hence those remarkable Corollaries drawn from the accurate Solution of such Difficulties now as formerly were plainly insoluble I mean the great Regard due to the Ancientest Sacred and Prophane Records and to the inspired Method whence they must have been deriv'd the Imperfection of Human Knowledge the Folly of rejecting Revealed Truths out of regard to uncertain Human Reasonings the Wisdom of adhering to the most obvious Sense of Scripture the Reasonableness of believing ScriptureAccounts and ScriptureMysteries tho' not fully comprehended by us the Justness of expecting Satisfaction in moral Difficulties in due time from the like Satisfaction afforded already in those that are Philosophical and the like do all receive a new and surprizing Confirmation and will therefore deserve a new and serious Consideration  NB  Dr  Halley  having himself given an Account of this Comet lately in Dr  Gregory  's English  Astronomy  P I here present it to the Reader  verbatim  that he may compare the two Accounts together for his more entire Satisfaction  "But as far as Probability from the Equality of Periods and similar Appearance of Comets may be urged as an Argument the late wondrous Comet of seems to have been the same which was seen in the Time of our King  Henry  I  Anno  which began to appear in  the  West  about the middle of  February  and continued for many Days after with such a Tail as was seen in that of And again in the Consulate of  Lampadius  and  Orestes  about the Year of Christ such another Comet appeared in the  West  of which  Malela  perhaps an Eyewitness relates that it was    a great and fearful Star  that it appeared in the  West  and emitted upwards from it a long white Beam and was seen for Days It were to be wish'd the Historian had told us what Time of the Year it was seen but 'tis however plain that the Interval between this and that of is nearly equal to that between and  viz  about Years And if we reckon backward such another Period we shall come to the th Year before  Christ  in which  Julius Caesar  was murder'd and in which there appear'd a very remarkable Comet mentioned by almost all the Historians of those Times and by  Pliny  in his Natural History  lib    c  who recites the Words of  Augustus Caesar  on this Occasion which lead us to the very Time of its Appearance and its Situation in the Heavens These Words being very much to our purpose it may not be amiss to recite them  In ipsis Ludorum meorum diebus sydus crinitum per septem dies in regione Coeli quae sub Septentrionibus est conspectum Id oriebatur circa undecimam horam diei clarum{que} omnibus terris conspicuum fuit  Now these  Ludi  were dedicated  Veneri genetrici  for from  Venus  the  Caesars  would be thought to be descended and began with the Birthday of  Augustus  viz  Sept  as may be collected from a Fragment of an Old  Roman  Calendar extant in  Gruter  pag and continued for Days during which the Comet appeared Nor are we to suppose that it was  seen only those Days but possibly both before and after Nor are we to interpret the Words  sub Septentrionibus  as if the Comet had appear'd in the  North  but that it was seen under the  Septem triones  or brighter Stars of  Ursa major  And as to its rising  Hora undecima diei  it can no ways be understood unless the word  diei  be left out as it is by  Suetonius  for it must have been very far from the Sun either to rise at Five in the Afternoon or at Eleven at Night in which Cases it must have appeared for a long time and its Tail have been so little remarkable that it could by no means be call'd  Clarum omnibus Terris conspicuum Sydus  But supposing this Comet to have traced the same Path with that of the Year the ascending part of the Orb will exactly represent all that  Augustus  hath said concerning it and is yet an additional Argument to that drawn from the Equality of the Period Thus 'tis not improbable but this Comet may have four times visited us at Intervals of about Years Whence the Transverse Diameter of its Elliptic Orb will be found √      ×  times greater than the annual Orb or times greater than the mean Distance of the Sun which Distance tho' immensely great bears no Proportion to that of the Fixed Stars"  FINIS  A
