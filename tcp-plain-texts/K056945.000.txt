 THE Double WELCOME A POEM TO THE Duke of Marlbro  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  B Bragg  at the  BlueBall  in  AveMary Lane    THE Double Welcome A POEM To the Duke of  MARLBOROUGH  My Lord  THE Muse that by Your Victory's Inspir'd  First sung those Conquests  all the World admir'd  Now sings the Triumphs of your Native Land  Where you  our Hearts  as well  as Troops  Command  Her Debt of Praise is Yours but 'tis her Due  That welcom'd Vict'ry  now to welcome You  And tho' her Verse  too mean  to sing your Fame  Injures the Hero by the Poet's Name  Abject and low and  scorch'd by PartyFire  Whom neither  Name  Invites nor  Hopes  Inspire  Yet this she claims she can Your Fame rehearse  Ʋnbiass'd  in Your Praise  Impartial  in her Verse  This Character sh' has kept and this she brings  She always scorn'd to flatter  tho' she sung to Kings  Satyr has been her Talent  Truth her Song  Truth  who can bear it  sung too loud too long  Bright Truth  that Stranger to the Jingling Train  Makes all their Praises Satyrs all their Satyrs vain  While Truth can neither this nor that explain  Th'  Ʋnspotted Standard  has been all her Aim  For this  she has felt her Fate  and sunk her Fame  For this  they've  damn'd the Poet and his Rimes  And slain th' unhappy Muse  for want of Crimes  Adapted thus to Sacred  Truth  and  Fame  She never sung but they were both her Theam  Stranger to Panegyrick and to Praise  It must be  some sublime  must her just Fancy raise  To  Truth  and  Merit  she was always true  She never could the flattering Flight pursue  And never prais'd but  William  Sir and  You  And should she spight of Nature strain her Thought  Should she his Lawrels sing that never fought  Should she make  Gallo  Chast and  Talus  Wise  And praise Immortal Blockheads in Disguise  Or feign a Hero  'Twould be so forc'd so aukward and so dull  Gallo  would seem  more Lewd Talus  seem  more a Fool  Truth thro' the Lawn of Flattery would shine  And in MockPraise the Satyr must be seen  Should we Eternal Trophies seem to raise  And Flying  Chamo  's Doubtful Vict'ry praise  Disputed Honours partially decide  And grant that Fame  Bellona  had deny'd  To Vict'ry's Statue new Mock Honours pay  And say they Conqu'red there that run away  'Twould with such Incoherent Nonsence shine  The blushing Hero must the aukward Praise decline  The  strong Collateral Banter  would appear  Courage so sung would read  like Hymns to Fear  The Painters thus by Contraries present  The allegorick  Devil  like the  Saint  But by some faint Reflection show their Care  The Cloven Meaning  should not fail t'appear  The Poet  Sir to Plainness thus ennur'd  Thus from the Charge of Flatt'ry first secur'd  An Honest and Unbyass'd Freedom brings  And  all the Nation listens  while he sings  In his Inviting Consort freely Joyn  Just so they did when first he sung  the Boyne  Just as when  Namur  's Conquer'd Walls he sung  Britannia  own'd his Harp Divinely strung  'Tis Subject makes a  Poet and the Verse  Must be Inspir'd when  William  we rehearse  His mighty Name Poetick Force procures  And next to him the Inspiration's  Yours  From Foreign Fields and  wild Danubian  Shore  Where  English  Armies never trod before  Fruitful of Dangers  long ennur'd to War  For  Great Gustavus  us'd to Conquer There  Herculean Labours past  and Hazards run  Unheard of  Marches  made unlook'd for  Vict'rys  won  From Battels  fought in Earnest  and the Field  Which none but  these  could win where  those  must yield  From unexampl'd Conduct and Success  That  ne'er had been so great had  This  been less  From Deeds too mighty to be spoke by Words  Printed in Death engrav'd  with English Swords  Confest by  Humbl'd France  and loudly told  By Valour  dearly bought  by Valour  dearly sold  From scatter'd Enemies and rescued Crowns  Which Envy nor  Disputes  nor Pride  disowns  You're welcome Sir  to this unthankful Shore  Where Men of Worth were  never own'd  before  If in the future Glories you pursue  You find the hateful Scandal happen true  The Names of  Schellenberg  and  Hockstet  lie  Buried with  Namure  and the  Boyn  in wild Obscurity  Let not your Virtue in Suspence appear  'T has always been the Fate of Merit here  A steady Glory ever has entail'd  The Grin of Envy Envy never fail'd  To act the high refin'd Extreme of Hell  How  William  found it  Blush my Muse to tell  Shall any Foreign Bard desire to know  Why  Britain  can so few like  William  show  Say angry Poet tell 'em 'tis because  Ingrateful Devils grudge them due Applause  The Nation's Genius acted from below  Rewards no Service will no Merit know  Fame's empty Record none but  Marlbro'  shows  Would  England  's Work on  England  's Terms espouse  But he like  Wiliam Heavens their Fame regard  Pursues true Virtue for its own Reward  Welcome Immortal Hero's  to that Shore  Where Men of  Equal Worth  were never seen before  From  Fam'd Breda  set out the mighty Train  William  too oft  set out from thence  in vain  Advance my Muse and view th' embattel'd Line  They pass the  Maese  the  Moselle  and the  Rhine  France  in Suspence the mighy Storm foresaw  The Conq'ring Squrdrons for the Battel draw  And  Mars  stood blindly hov'ring o'er  Landau  Laugh at the guilty baffled God of War  Ye Sons of Arms the Scene's prepar'd afar  Not  Lewis  now not  Mars  himself could know  Where  English Jove  his Thunderbolt would throw  No Traytors brib'd by  France  could lead the way  Not Hell it self the Project could betray  Nor sell the Nation as in  William  's time for Pay  The Troops amus'd with Halts and Feints of War  The just Surprize instructs them what to fear  When you to  Danube  's Banks in hast advance  A Length unlook'd for unforeseen by  France  Swift as the  German  Eagles lead you fly  On Gusts of Hope and Wings of Victory  Your Passes o'er the  Swabian  Rocks appear  Like  Hannibal  's with Flame and Vinegar  And when the distant Vales their Prospect show  You threaten Conquest to the Plains below  Before your powerful Troops  Bavaria  's fly  And  Schellenberg  give way to Victory  The fam'd Ascent had thirteen times and more  Been storm'd and ne'er was won but once before  Once did the great  Gustave Bavaria  here pursue  He Conquer'd here because he fought like You  From thence thro' ravag'd Towns and conquer'd Plains  The Monument of Victory remains  Augsburg  and  Munick  trembl'd at your Name  Tho' not inform'd of your approaching Fame  To  Blenheim happy Name  the Scenes advance  There gathers all the Thunderbolts of  France  A Leash of Armies on thy Plains appear  Each fancied able to support a War  And free a Nation from the Vanity of Fear  We that at Distance saw th' approaching Day  Knew the Design and saw the Bloody Way  Blame not great Prince the doubts we own were true  Our anxious Thoughts for  England  and for You  We knew your brave resolv'd and steady Mind  But who durst hope for what remain'd behind  Who durst foretell the Glories of the Day  That saw the dreadful Dangers of the Way  Not Heaven it self had we the News receiv'd  From Heaven it self would here ha' been believ'd  When first the Tidings thro' the Nation flew  We pauz'd to ask if 'twas a Dream or true  Amaz'd almost as much as they that fled  While those with Fear and these with Joy dismay'd  Speak all ye Sons of  Rhime  the Day rehearse  The Theme's too high for my too humble Verse  Apollo  must your Heads at once inspire  For needful Praise with Emblematick Fire  He that in suited Verse to  Marlbro'  writes  Should feel that very Spirit by which he fights  Yet still the meanest Poet of the Train  Keeps on nor shall his Tribute come in vain  Not all are  Virgils  to  Mecaenas  come  Yet all huzza'd  Augustus  back to  Rome  When from the lesser Honour of the Day  He brought the  Aegyptian  Lover's Crown away  And thus while  Caesar  's Glory you pursue  The Nation's Praises are your Native Due  The universal Suffrage spreads your Name  And all Men bless the Poet in your Fame  Poet a large Parenthesis allow  Say here he  Conquer'd  leave the mighty How  The vast Particulars let those explain  That sing in Numbers suited to the Man  Let  Addison  our Modern  Virgil  sing  For he's a Poet fitted for a King  No Hero will his mighty Flight disdain  The First  as thou  the Last  of the Inspir'd Train  Maecenas  has his Modern Fancy strung  And fix'd his Pension first or he had never sung  Thou unregarded pay'st thy Debt to Fame  Oppress'd by Fate and too obscure to Name  Envy and PartySpleen h' has never known  No humbling Jayls has pull'd his Fancy down  The Towring Youth with high Success aspires  And fings as one whose Song the World admires  Yet say he Conquer'd tho' the mighty How  For  Addison  thou may'st in large Parenthesis allow  Trace him from  Bleinheim  and  Danubian  Plains  The  Gallick  Captiv'd Heoes in his Chains  Trace him to  Philipsburgh  and to  Landau  And tell the  French  'tis true as they foresaw  He would the mighty Bastions there pull down  Tho' not before  their Army's overthrown  Attend the Hero to the ancient  Saar  And see him threaten  Native France  with War  Surrender  Treves  that fatal Town to  France  Their Troops abandon it as his Advance  Remind them of old  Holstein  and  Crequi  There  France as now at Bleinheim  learn'd to fly  Tell us no more of Conquest  Fame  's  oppress'd  The Breathless Muses claim some time to rest  Saarbruck  and  Traarback  will but spoil our Verse  So harsh no Numbers can their Sounds rehearse  So  Nimeghen  distracted soft  Boileau  The Subject lofty and the Poet low  Made his just Numbers halt his Verses lame  For want of Rhimes to the Exotic Name  Thus from a vast Variety of Scene  And six huge Conquests fix'd in one Campaign  Bavaria Conquer'd  Settl'd and Subdu'd  The flying Prince four Hundred Mile pursu'd  From  Nineteen Towns surrendred  and the Field  With slaughter'd Heaps and vanquish'd Legions fill'd  From Captive Princes in your Train brought Home  So  Casar  led the Kings of  Gaul  to  Rome  From Trophies nobly bought and fetch'd from far  From boldly finishing the Jest of War  Your're welcome Sir  behold th' approaching Throng  Of Three great Nations list'ning to my Song  How has this wise pretending Age till now  Talkt big of Fighting never yet knew how  Our Soldiers tyr'd with strange Fateaguing Die  And in the  Ditch  not  Bed  of Honour Lie  Starv'd with the Cold and Terror of the Night  But never show'd the  how  or  where  to fight  The weary Land the  Trade of War  resents  For what the End designs the Means prevents  The Miseries we to this Day endure  They caus'd that always  have been paid to cure  Plunder's their Battles and the Pay's their End  They shun their Enemy and rob their Friend  Peace would such Soldiers Livelihood destroy  And so indeed they'd for their Country die  For  Fighting  's just the way to be undone  And Conquest  would conclude a War too soon  Good Husbandry as  Woly told us how  Had made the  Irish  War ha' held till now  But  Fighting Ginkle  struck the Stroke too soon  And so the Nation's sav'd and all the Rs undone  But you instructed for your Country's Good  The Cheats of War have all at once snbdued  And they that thought the Field was but a Play  Where all might cheat the Nation for their Pay  With Lace and Feathers blustering a Campaign  To all the Nation but themselves in vain  Grow rich upon the Plunder of our Lands  And raise great Fortunes out of low Commands  These found the Banter on themselves made good  While you the proper End of War pursu'd  Our Campaign  Beaus  no more shall mock the Field  And none take Arms but those that dare be kill'd  The Powder'd Wig the SnuffBox an  me  Will court no more the Musquet and the Drum  And  Beaus  go Rakes to War come Bullies Home  The very Words a different Accent bear  Fighting  must now be understood  by War  Battel and Death's synonimous in Name  And Wounds and Blood will only purchase Fame  Cowards must lay their bought Commissions down  Their Camps the Pit and their Campaign the Town  There they may bully swagger and repeat  The mighty no Engagements they were at  And fight the  French  in Tea and Chocolate  But he that follows  Marlbro'  to the Field  Must all his Fame on dangerous Merit build  Must look for Blows and fairly state his Case  Shame at his Back and Death before his Face  A General that can show him how to die  And push him on to Conquer Victory  Shame  Fear's TwinSister  makes a Coward brave  He fights to lose the Life he dares not save  Fear makes him bold because he dares not fly  It wants more Heart to run away than die  For who dare turn his Back when  Marlbro  's by  The English Arms  grown dull with Rust and Peace  Tarnish'd with Luxury and stain'd with Ease  You have new pointed Sir with Hearts of Steel  And  France  confesses what she can't conceal  Our Honour  clouded with Contempt and Time  Sullied with long Disuse and sunk in Crime  Buried so deep  allow the Muse to grieve  William  himself could not her Name retrieve  Tho' thro' Ten Thousand different Dangers sought  Tho' thro' Ten Thousand Victories he fought  The transmigrated Phantosme you obtain  And in your Fame revive her once again  Our Heroes  Few and long ago forgot  The Breed extinct behold the Barren Spot  Stiril in Worth and Poor in Sons of Fame  Crime taints the best Record and blasts the worthless Name  William  's the First for Thirteen Ages past  And Fate portends that  Marlbro'  will be Last  How shall the Strength of Nature save the Breed  Who shall to  William  's Fame and Yours succeed  And now from all the Dangers of the Field  Which Gods and Men with equal Joys beheld  Which all our widowed Harps has newly strung  Which  Thousand Heroes  fought a  Thousand Poets  sung  To  Britain  's crowded Shores your Triumphs come  And all the wond'ring Nation  shouts you Home  A  Double Welcome  you at once possess  For  Double Conquests  crown you with Success  With Double Joy  we shout and twice applaud  Councils  at Home and  Conquest  from Abroad  Interest in all our Praises will appear  You're welcome Sir because  you're wanted here  We want you here  to calm our wild Debates  And ballance  Parties  as you ballance  States  To check Insulting Factions and supply  Immoderate  Heat with forc'd  Humility  Condators to  Consolidate  And  Tack  our  Ters  to their own dear Fate  To calm the Churches Sea and keep it still  And fix the Nation's Peace  against her Will  Thus when from fighting Armies Sir you come  You must engage  with Devils nearer Home  Armies of Hell born Monsters must appease  The  Titans Heaven attack'd  were Fools to these  They Mountains threw and  Hills  erect on  Hills  These Mountain  Bis  Consolidate to  Bis  The mighty Parallel agrees in Parts  From Hell  they  fetch'd their Strength as these  their  Arts  They  Heavens high Power with borrow'd Power invade  These Heaven's Vicegerent Queen assault by her own Aid  Like them they fall Heaven has decreed it so  And you must ANN's Immortal Thunder throw  See how th' embattel'd  Troops of Strife  appear  Words are their missive Weapons Noise the War  With  HighChurch Zeal  and Party Spirits fir'd  With Hell's immortal  Hate of Peace  inspir'd  A Pulpit War  whence should Sedition come  Our  Soldiers  fight Abroad our Priests at Home  Arm'd with vast Helms of  Contradicting Truth  With Plumes of  Incoherent Sence  set forth  Self inconsistent Reason  puffs the Mind  Bluster  comes on before and  Distant Modesty  behind  See how the Black Brigades in Arms advance  You'll see no such Sir when you conquer  France  Their Meaning's easy to be understood  The Gown has often  dipt the Slieves  in Blood  Would you their Sence of things  Sir  understand  And know for what it is they embroil the Land  Quite different Ends of War they all profess  They  fight for  Plunder  Sir and  You for Peace  Your nobler Hazards help the World t' enjoy  You fight for Right these  meerly to destroy  Pardon the Poet all your Wars are Jests  You've fought with Men  you never fought  with Priests  Disdain not Sir the Instructions of our Verse  Your Arts of War  will not this Cloud disperse  Priests like the Female Sex when they engage  There's always something bloody in their Rage  Thus Nature always in Extremes delights  The greatest Falls are from the greatest Heights  Angels sublime in Nature and Divine  Are therefore turn'd to Devils when they sin  And Humane Sons of God are worse than they  When once they can the Laws of Crime obey  The high Seraphick Office qualifies  And they're the wickeder because they're wise  Expect no Quarter where the Tribe Commands  They fight you with  their Heads  and not  their Hands  My Muse prophane no more the sacred Name  Jesus  are these thy Sons  The Church  the horrid Ravishers disowns  And loud beneath the  Weight of Party  's Groans  These are the strong  Bandity of the Gown  Who preach for  God's Sake  plunder for  their own  Our State Divines that push the Party Cause  And  swear and pray  for Persecution Laws  Own 'tis against their Doctrine and their  Sense  But freely grant they'd be  at that Expence  Would sell the Church the Nation and the Queen  While all our mod'rate Clergy strive with them in vain  With mighty Arms thus they invade our Peace  In vain the Queen entreats their calm Recess  Tells them if she should grant the wild Desire  And pass the Publick Mischief they require  They'd grasp but Air an empty fruitless Name  And be the first would perish in their own Flame  In vain the united Peers reject the Bill  Men seldom quit the Hopes of doing ill  They're doubly damn'd that can despair of Hell  Th' unhappy Wretches bent to push their Fate  And born to find their own Mistakes too late  Only adjourn the Mischiefs they design'd  Pleas'd with the Hopes of Greater yet behind  So far from Peace  Peace ne'er was their Design  They can for no Repulse the Feud decline  Their weighty Clamours all the Nation fill  And  Damn the Lords  because they  dam'd the Bill  Whole Troops of Satyrs in their Front advance  Their Houshold Bands  more fierce than those of  France  Our  Poet trembles when their Troops appear  But You Sir never have been us'd to fear  There fam'd  Sachevrel  leads the  Vast Forlorn  By him the Party's  Bloody Standard  's born  Abandon'd both by Modesty and Sence  And Manners left him as the Consequence  Scolding's  his Native Talent and  to Rail  Serves him for Arguments when Reasons fail  With College Licence  and  Assize  Applause  He damns the Queen the Bishops and the Laws  Nor spares the Church her self  but gives the Lie  To all her Doctrine and Authority  High  Church Buffoon  the  Oxford  's stated Jest  A Noisy Sawcy Swearing Drunken Priest  Ly  a Turncoat with extended Throat  Has chang'd his Cassock for a Campaign Coat  Stript of his Shepherd's Cloathing  he appears  The very  Wolf he dress'd  in Asses Ears  His Ecclesiastick Dignity lays down  And hates the Pulpit for  he hates the Crown  The Revolution damns affronts the Queen  His Sword the Gown supplies the Text his Pen  He's now  a Priest incog  with Sword and Wig  And swears  to let you know he hates a  Whig  His strong  Non jurant  Squadrons brings along  Below Lampoon  too rakish for our Song  He damns the Church for Schismaticks because  They alter'd their Allegiance  by the Laws  Declares the Church of  England  's only there  Where strong Aversions to the Regency appear  Unchurches all our Clergy at a Blow  And votes the Bishops useless  This  mighty Captain Rake  deserves your Care  His pointed Darts in HighChurch Front appear  Ready to charge the Loyal Troops you bring  With MockReligion and  a Pageant King  Mn  a starving Mercenary Priest  A Jobbing Hackney Vicious Pulpit Jest  From  Ostia  and from  Belgia  lately fled  And took the Oaths for very want of Bread  Immoral  Life and an  immodest  Tongue  And dealt in  Rhime  and  Wit  and  BaudySong  The needy Prelate at whose bounteous Gate  He lay expecting and importunate  Bought his wish'd Absence with a Teaching Cure  To make just Room for Ds about his Door  'Till from the clam'rous Claimers forc'd to fly  His Justice gave his Charity the L  May they from Creditors be never free  That nourish Sacred Drones in Charity  Whose mighty Alms by mighty Debts are known  And lend to God what never was their own  Give borrow'd Sums and borrow'd Sermons preach  And rob the Poor to help relieve the Rich  These are the Generals of the mighty Band  The  Tallards and Marsins  of high Command  Mean as they are they lead the wond'rous Host  Of Priestrid Worthies who some Brains have lost  With  Packingtonian Fury  hurried on  Whose Zeal must for their Ignorance attone  Who hunt deep Contraries with eager Pain  Pull down the Church to build it up again  For how can high  non jurant L  rail  When strong  Consolidating Projects  fail  How can they all their wav'ring Logick fix  And prove we should Conform to Schismaticks  For if the Church as Learned Men have said  Is parted from her only lawful Head  And the weak few their Duty who retain  Are all the real Church that can remain  The Devil must this double Knot untie  And explicate the wilder Mystery  How the Dissenters can be charg'd by both  Two Contraries agree and neither  of them  Truth  Damn the whole Party's Nonconformity  And yet would damn them too if they comply  Coercive Powers provoke and strive by Force  To  Rereform us all  from bad to worse  Force us with one Schismatick Church to joyn  And at one Breath  unchurch us  all again  Let  Bly  blush if not forsook by Grace  And let his Sence assume his lost Religions Place  Let him confess the throwing out the B  Cannot two Clashing Churches Wish fulfil  That These must first abandon Common Sence  Forsake their Cause and quit their own Defence  When they Occasional Oppressions seek  And cure the Schism by the Schismatick  Assist Great Sir your Suppliant Country's Peace  And screen the Church from wild Absurdities  Aid her more moderate Clergy to defend  Temper  the Means and  Peace  the mighty End  The Universal Voice of Truth and Law  That made to drive when this should fail to draw  Joyn to engage you in the ju  Defen    Of Temper Moderation Right and Sence  And of the Nation's Peace by Consequence  On this the mighty Publick Weal depends  Conquest  the Nation from her Foes defends  Compleat it Sir and save us from our Friends  Thus Sir the Nation's Guardian you'll appear  Abroad suppress at Home prevent the War  Anticipate our Factions in their Growth  And smother Feud beneath the Arms of Truth  And this Your Double Vict'ry will create  You'll heal Religion and preserve the State  Whenever Heaven shall thus at once en  ine  One Agent two such vast Events to join  The Nations must concur the General Voice  Will bless the Man to crown the sacred Choice  FINIS
