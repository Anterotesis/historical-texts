 THE VOYAGES  Travels  and  Adventures  OF WILLIAM OWEN GWIN VAUGHAN  Esq  WITH THE  HISTORY  of his  BROTHER  JONATHAN VAUGHAN Six Years a Slave in  Tunis  Intermix'd with the HISTORIES of  Clerimont Maria Eleanora  and Others Full of Various TURNS of FORTUNE  VOLUME  the  SECOND    LONDON Printed for J WATTS And Sold by J OSBORN at the  GoldenBall  in  PaternosterRow  MDCCXXXVI  THE VOYAGES TRAVELS AND MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM OWEN GWIN VAUGHAN  Esq  _WE arriv'd at  Calais  after a pleasant Passage of Six Hours and took up our Lodging at the  TableRoyal  where we were detain'd four Days with the false Report of the Death of the  French  King  Lewis  XIV for the Governor kept the Gates shut and wou'd not permit any Foreigners to go out  of the City  Calis  or  Calais  is a very strong Town in the Province of  Picardy  tho' I think not strong enough to be call'd as it is one of the Keys of  France  It is as near as I cou'd guess a little bigger than  Dover  but more populous It wou'd I believe be a very poor Place if it were not for the Resort of Foreigners and a  Frenchman  told me that when they were at War with  England  their White Bread immediately turn'd to Brown intimating their Riches did not come from their own Nation  The Cause of my Stay here gave me no small Joy for a Letter came to my Hands from my dear  Isabella  which was left at the PostHouse of  Dover  and brought me by the same Captain I came over with to  Calais  This prov'd a Consolation to me in all my Travels for whenever I was melancholy I had Recourse to that The Letter was as follows  WHAT shall I say I have not Expressions enough to paint out my Passion Thy Absence and the farther thou goest from me increase my Love and Anxiety I look on the allseeing Sun and bless his Beams  because it shines on thee I worship the Winds as the  Indians  do the Devil for fear their Rising shou'd be prejudicial to thee and the Number of 'em with their Names almost equals the  Roman Catholick  Saints yet I am oblig'd to revere 'em all in gross as they do My Time is almost spent in reading the Accounts of Places where I suppose the Disposer of my Heart is to visit I have found the Road to  Dover  and din'd with you in Imagination tho' Food is almost a Stranger to me I saw your Horses brought out and pursu'd the Way with you to  Dover  I saw the Castle the Pier and view'd the fatal Vessel design'd to waft from me all my Peace of Mind  I follow'd it as far as my poor Eyes cou'd see and waited on the Beach sighing to the Winds till you arriv'd at  Calais  as fatal to me for my Loss as the Loss of That was to Queen  Mary  the Sister to Queen  Elizabeth  who when she dy'd told her Attendants  they might see  Calais  written on her Heart  If Death shou'd end my Days thy Image wou'd be found on mine To be a Day without seeing the Idol of my Soul I have thought long but Oh to be absent for three times three hundred and sixty five Days nay perhaps for ever what Heart like mine can bear the Imagination  But yet the Day will come two tedious Days of the Time are gone already If Heav'n will be pleas'd to send you back I shall be grown by that time well vers'd in Geography for that shall be now my only Study and I shall think it some Satisfaction in all my Griefs to know the Situation Climate and Constitution of those Places my Love intends to visit I cou'd dwell on this melancholy Subject for ever but must take Leave of the dearest Object to the disconsolate  ISABELLA  When our Embargo was taken off we took PostChaises and arriv'd at  Paris  in three Days from whence in compliance to my Uncle I sent him the following short Account of my Journey  My dear Uncle  AFTER turning my Back to my Native Country tho' my Mind was still there we arriv'd safe at  Calais  from thence after being detain'd four Days by a false Report of the King's Death we made three hard Days Journies to  Paris  From whence I shall send you this short Description to let you see I intend to follow your Precepts exactly  Paris  the Capital  of  France  is situated upon an Island in the River  Seine  which gives Name to a County call'd the  Isle of France  tho' it is possible it may stand upon more Ground than  London  yet I take the latter to be better inhabited than the former Their publick Buildings far exceed ours in Number and Magnificence The  Louvre  much surpasses that of  St James's  or  Whitehall  before it was consum'd by Fire As to their Cathedral Church of  NotreDame  I can't make any Comparison with that of St  Paul  's till I see it finish'd but I think this a noble august Building and the Magnificence of the Inside shews their Religion to be well drest and gives a Lustre I am not able to describe The Archbishop of  Paris  seems to be seated with more Grandeur than an Eastern King  Here's Plenty of Wine but no good Water that I cou'd meet with In the Chapel call'd  The Holy Chapel  which is a fine Building I was shew'd Part of the Crown of Thorns the  Jews  in Derison honour'd our Saviour with and two of the Nails that fixt him to the Cross but I must own my Faith was not quite strong enough to believe it tho' I thought it prudent to keep my Thoughts to myself The Monasteries are so numerous here that one wou'd imagine the Laity were not the major Part and most of the  Holy Buildings are fit to be Palaces for the greatest Princes  The Earth in one of their Churchyards as I am told will consume the Interr'd in eight Days The reverend Father  Raimond  whom you commended me to has been dead more than four Years But his Brother who has taken Orders since who was also one of your Acquaintance has done me many Services upon your Account Last Night he took me to the  JesuitsCollege  where a Play was perform'd with the utmost Magnificence and the Number of the Chorus Dancers surpris'd me I counted fortyfour in one Entry In short Sir  Paris  has many curious Objects to delight the Eye and captivate the Senses I have sent you the Book of the  Carrousels  that were perform'd    when the double Marriages of the King and his Sister with the Prince and Infanta of  Spain  were celebrated In the same Place King  Henry II  in one of those Tournaments was kill'd by a Wound in the Eye I am inform'd by Monsieur  Coypel  the Ingraver the Figure of every Person is exactly like whom it is design'd for I have also sent you the Statue of  Lewis the Thirteenth  of the same Composition in every degree that stands in the middle of the  PalaceRoyal  and in my Judgment it wants  nothing but Bulk to be as fine as the Original You will likewise find in the same Parcel all the  Classics  printed at the  Louvre  tho' I was oblig'd to Father  Raimond  for your Favourite  Terence  the rest I procur'd of a Bookseller Tomorrow the good Father is to introduce me to Monsieur and Madam  D'Acier  where I promise to myself much Satisfaction if my want of Years will not make 'em look coldly upon me I gave Monsieur  Audran  the Present you sent him and in return he has sent you a Set of his Battles from  Le Brun  of the first Impression which by the by Uncle seem'd as if you had sent as they say in  Wales AppleSauce to fetch a Pig  for they are hardly to be valu'd  After telling you the Dirt of  Paris  like an ill Reputation is hard to be got off I shall conclude my little Account of that City with telling you the Monastery of  Val de Grace  is I think one of the finest Buildings in  Paris  which one of their Poets has thought fit to commend in the following Lines  Urbs  orbi similis toto celeberrima  Mundo  Musarum sedes  Regina Lutetia  salve  Francigenae  tu Metropolis pulcherrima Gentis  Hospitio  Regum  grato  Regisque ministros  Excipis reliquas das jura suprema per urbes  From  Paris  I shall lead you to  Versailles  a Royal Palace four  French  Leagues West of this famous City I shall wave the Description of the Palace and bring you into the Gardens which I suppose are finish'd since you were in  France  When you are enter'd the Bason of  Syrene  stands full in your way and after that twentytwo more fine Fountains WaterFalls and Cascades that delight the Eye with an Exuberance of Variety From these you pass into the  Labyrinth  a Place you can't well get out of without a silver Clue and yet 'tis the most delightful Place to lose one's self in in the Universe  Aesop  stands on one side of the Entrance and  Cupid  on the other And the Fables of  Aesop  are represented in WaterWorks within the  Labyrinth  that is    of them which you must take in Order    The  Owl  and  other Birds  The  Cock  and  Partridges  The  Cock  and  Fox  The  Cock  and  precious Stone  which I think ought to be the first as in  Aesop  The  Pendant Cat  with several  Rats  The  Eagle  and  Fox  The  Jay  and  Peacocks  The  DunghillCock  and  TurkeyCock  The  Peacock  and  Magpy  The  Serpent Anvil  and  File  The  Old Monkey  and  Young Ones  The  Battle  of the  Beasts    The  Hen  and  Chickens  The  Fox  and  Crane  The  Crane  outwitting the  Fox  The  Peacock  and  Nightingale  The  Parrot  and  Monkey  The  Monkey  turn'd  Judge  The  Rat  and  Frog  The  Hare  and  Tortoise  The  Wolf  and  Crane  The  Kite  and  other Birds  The  Monkey crown'd  The  Fox  and  Stag  The  Rats  in  Council  The  Monkey  and  young Cat  with the  Chesnuts  The  Fox  and  Grapes  The  Eagle Coney  and  Beetle  The  Wolf  and  Porcupine  The  Serpent  with  many Heads  The  Cat  and  young Cock  The  Kite  and  Pidgeons  The  Dolphin  and  Monkey  The  Fox  and  Crow  The  Monkey  and  Crane  The  Wolf  in the  Statuary  's  Shop  The  Snake  and  Porcupine  The  Ducks  and  Spaniel  And all these Fables are as well express'd as if you saw 'em pencill'd by the finest Painter the Sight I must own gave me a Profusion of Delight  Nothing in the World can shew the Grandeur of the Monarch more than this Palace and Gardens And the Nobility to imitate their Prince have built handsome Palaces near  Versailles  so that this Place that was fifty Years ago a barren Spot is now become a great City  I mean for the Multiplicity of the Buildings tho' every thing is excessive dear from the great Concourse of Nobility that surround their Prince A  French  Gentleman that had been in  England  told me he wonder'd the Kings of  England  had not more magnificent Palaces Gardens and WaterWorks I reply'd we had finer WaterWorks than any they cou'd boast of WaterWorks return'd the  Frenchman  where I reply'd in the City of  London  where every House had a Sufficiency of Water convey'd from the Rivers by Pipes He confess'd indeed that was a very great Work and was certainly of more Use than theirs of  Versailles    When we return'd to  Paris  Father  Raimond  carry'd me to a little Village call'd  Mont Martire  or  Mons Martyrum  where we din'd at the Abbey of Nuns of the Order of St  Bennet  This Hill and Village took its Name of  Mons Martyrum  from St  Denis  the Protector of  France  who was beheaded before the Image of  Mercury  in the  Pagans  Time And the good People will have it that the pious Saint walk'd three Mile with his Head under his Arm and then let it drop where since they have built a Town after the Saint's Name But I am apt to believe their Heads that approve this  Story are no more a Burden to their Shoulders than the good Saint's was when he had it under his Arm Father  Raimond  otherwise Bigot enough to his Religion seems to laugh at such Traditional Stories  The same Afternoon we made a Tour to the Town of St  Denis  where we view'd the Cathedral which is very magnificent tho' the Repository of their Kings to me seem'd the chiefest Ornament The Inhabitants tell you this Church was never ill us'd either in the  Norman  or  English  Wars tho' most of the others in  France  where the  English  or  Normans  came suffer'd much The Abbot of this Place has more Power than many Archbishops and owns no Superior but the King being Suffragan to no Archbishop And tho' the Monarchs of  France  are crown'd at  Rhemes  the  Regalia  is kept at St  Dennis  under the Care of the  Abbot  They also Boast of more Relicks than any other Place in the Universe as the Head of St  Denis  put in a silver Nightcap with fine oriental Pearl round it a Nail of our Saviour's Cross the Finger that St  Thomas  put into our Saviour's Side an Arm of St  Simon  the Head of St  Bennet  an  Englishman  that was with me the same time we saw these Rarities told me St  Bennet  must be a very monstrous Saint for he knew of one of  his Heads in  Italy  and another in  Spain  but his Companion salv'd that by telling him he shed his Heads as Stags do their Horns I hope you'll pardon this merry Account since it is not my own Then there is a Cup that King  Solomon  us'd to drink out of but my merry  Enlishman  affronted the Friar that shew'd us these Rarities by asking him if King  Soloman  drank it full always for it was a very large one A Pot that was at the Wedding of  Cana  in  Galilee  where our Saviour turn'd Water into Wine  Joan  of  Arc  's Sword which I think is bigger than that of  Edward the Third  's in  Henry the Seventh  's Chapel in  WestminsterAbbey Judas  's Lanthorn that he bore when he betray'd our Saviour with a Kiss and many more which we did not see for when our  English  Companion ask'd the Friar how often the Horns had been mended he grew outrageous and wou'd shew us no more and Father  Raimond  was very much scandaliz'd in bringing such a Parcel of  Hereticks  to profane their Relicks by looking on 'em  I am much pleas'd with my Tutor tho' he seems very reserv'd in giving me any Account of his former Condition or Family Tho' an Accident happen'd a few Days ago that makes me imagine there's something very extraordinary in  his Affairs An  English  young Gentleman a Traveller did me the Honour to make me a Visit some few Days ago and my Tutor coming in seem'd in the utmost Confusion at his Sight and went out of the Room unperceiv'd by my Visitor with a great deal of Precipitation In a Day or two afterwards when I inform'd him I was to dine with the same Person he intreated me very earnestly to be excus'd and told me he had such Reasons for not seeing him that if I was acquainted with 'em I wou'd certainly pardon him in desiring not to be in his Company I fansy when we are a little more familiar he will be more free and let me into this Affair I must confess it puzzles me very much I shall not give you any farther Trouble now my dear Uncle but be pleas'd to give my Respects to the amiable Family we last visited and give me Leave to subscribe myself  Your most affectionate Nephew  c  P S  I have wrote to my Father by the same Post I thought it wou'd not be wrong to let you know it for fear you shou'd give yourself any Trouble in communicating to 'em the Contents of this and I shall always proceed in the same Method in my Travels tho' I shou'd  be glad to hear from you how the Family goes on  I was oblig'd to leave  Paris  sooner than I intended upon receiving the following Letter  SIR  I  KNOW for certain your Life is in Danger therefore wou'd advise you to quit the Place as soon and as secretly as you can A Gentleman of my Acquaintance imagines the Coldness of his Mistress proceeds from the Esteem she has for you I have in vain endeavour'd to convince him of the contrary Perhaps I should not be in so much Fear for you if he had Generosity enough openly to resent his illgrounded Hatred to you but I know him to he a Person as void of Honour as of Courage therefore every thing is to be fear'd from him Take care of the Servant you have hir'd for I have taken notice they are often together It is possible there may be no Harm in their Intimacy however I think Caution is necessary Therefore if you please I will borrow him for a few Days and send him upon a Business that he may execute for me as well as an honest Man if he shou'd prove a Villain I wou'd not have you stir out today  nor receive any Visits if you can handsomely avoid it I'll be with you in the Evening and inform you farther  Entirely yours RAIMOND  The receiving of this Letter very much surpriz'd me for all the Time I remain'd in  Paris  I had not made any Acquaintance with the Fair Sex and bating the Visit I made to Monsieur and Madam  D'Acier  I had not been in the Company of any Females The Thoughts of leaving  Paris  very much rejoic'd my Tutor who was never easy upon the Account of that young Gentleman I communicated the Letter to him who was as much surpriz'd as I was In the Evening Father  Raimond  came and press'd me to be gone the next Day He inform'd me his Acquaintance had courted a young Lady and shew'd him a Letter from the very Person where she herself inform'd him of all he knew and was as pressing for me to be gone as the good Father Therefore I agreed to set out for  Marseilles  the next Day in order to imbark for  Italy  and my Baggage was to follow me I sent my  French  Servant to the good Father who took him home that Night and the next Morning I pursu'd my Journey with my Tutor and my  English  Servant who might very well pass for a  Frenchman  for he spoke that Language as well as  English  I was very much surpriz'd and vex'd at this Accident for having got acquainted with several Persons of the  RoyalAcademy  at  Paris  I had the pleasing Hope of cultivating my Understanding by their Conversation for Study and the Thoughts of my lovely  Isabella  fill'd up all my Time  In our third Day's Journey near the Skirts of a Wood we were attack'd by half a Dozen Robbers who wou'd have certainly got the better of us if while we were engag'd with them two  French  Gentlemen with their Servants had not arriv'd seasonably to our Rescue We left two dead upon the Place and the other four made their Escape I return'd the  French  Gentlemen the Thanks they deserv'd for their Succour for if they had not come to our Assistance we must certainly have been murder'd but by the Providence of God not one of us was wounded The Gentlemen were bound for  Toulon  therefore I resolv'd to accompany them to that Place which lay as convenient they inform'd me  to embark for  Italy  as  Marseilles  We thought it proper to push on without taking any Notice of w  happen'd to us because it wou'd retard our Journey tho' we might have receiv'd a Reward for the Death of the two Thieves We all arriv'd safe at  Toulon  without meeting any other Accident by the way from whence I sent Orders to  Marseilles  for my Baggage to be brought from thence But the  French  Gentlemen leaving me the next Day I thought it proper to go to  Marseilles  myself  Toulon  the  Telo Martius  of the  Romans  is a Bishoprick and has a very fine Port and very strongly fortify'd The two great Moles of Paces each that almost cover the whole Port has not been many Years finish'd by the present King  Lewis  XIV tho' begun by  Henry  IV When I arriv'd at  Marseilles  which lies about Miles from  Toulon  I receiv'd a Packet of Letters from  England  which the good Father  Raimond  took care to send with another from  Paris  from an unknown Lady that unravell'd the Meaning of my so suddenly leaving that City the Letter was as follows  SIR  I  AM in Love and have long been belov'd by a Gentleman that has taken it into his Head to be jealous of you tho' I never had the Honour of conversing with you I have seen you I must confess and had the Inadvertency to commend you before him tho' without any farther Thought for the Person I mention has laid such Hold of my Heart it can never get from him 'Twas I that us'd that Method with Father  Raimond  to make you abandon  Paris  which I hope you will forgive for I shou'd never have brought to Temper the Heart of him whom I love more than myself if you had continu'd here The Design upon your Life was all Fiction for the Man whom I adore has too much Honour to deal so treacherously with any Person His only Fault is Jealousy but that's a Sign of his Passion for me As you came to  Paris  as a Traveller I hope your sudden leaving it will not prove prejudicial to you And remember the Women of  France  are not so fond of Variety as many Foreigners imagine Tho' I believe you have too good Understanding to fall into that mean way of Thinking I am so much a Stranger to you that I hardly know whether you are vers'd enough in our Language to read  an Epistle of this Nature therefore it has given me some Trouble to have it translated into  English  for which I hope you will pardon one who will ever have a good Opinion of your good Nature The Servant too is honest and to reward him for the Loss of so good a Master I have taken him into my Service and I intend to make him amends I might have let you continue in Ignorance of this Adventure but I cou'd not bear you shou'd have a hard Thought of the Person I esteem tho' an utter Stranger to you and I shall think my self oblig'd ever to subscribe myself  Your humble Servant  c  I must own I was a little uneasy to be made such a Tool of However I soon forgave the Lady considering the Power of Love  I was compell'd to wait a Fortnight for want of a Vessel to imbark in for  Genoa  and therefore had Leisure enough to view this City  Marseilles  is a City of the greatest Antiquity in  France  It was founded by the  Phoceans  a Colony from  Athens  as  Strabo  tells me It is one of the finest Ports of  France  and the safest for it was never known any Vessel ever perish'd there by Storm It was a  flourishing City in the time of the  Romans  who made Alliances with 'em finding it not an easy Matter to overcome it By the Means of its  Levant  Trade it is esteem'd the richest City in  France  and its Situation upon the  Mediterranean  makes it so advantageous for Trade that it will ever prove so This City was free till the Year when it submitted to the King of  France  with the rest of  Provence  It is so well Peopled that it is difficult to walk the Streets for the Multitude of Passengers backwards and forwards The publick Buildings are very magnificent Here the Gallies of the Crown are kept in admirable Order under command of a strong Tier of Guns The Churches and Monasteries are numerous and beautiful and the Clergy here seem more open and facetious than in any other Place I have seen in  France    I embark'd for  Genoa  in a  Dutch  Vessel bound for that Place but in the Dusk of the Evening which succeeded the first Day of our Voyage we were pursu'd by a Corsair of  Tunis  The Fright and Confusion was very great for our Vessel carry'd but Eight Guns and Sixteen Men besides Eight Passengers The Master made many false Tacks  in hopes to lose him in the Night but at the Dawn of Day we discover'd him about two Leagues to Leeward of us and the Wind ceasing with the Rising of the Sun we had no Hopes to escape for they made up to us with their Oars which we were without However both Sailors and Passengers resolv'd upon their Defence and the rather because we observ'd a Vessel under the  French  Shore who by her Working seem'd to endeavour to come up to us tho' some of the most timorous wou'd have it another Rover of  Barbary  Notwithstanding we made ready to receive 'em But the Wind freshning a little we chose to make all the Sail we cou'd for the Port of  Toulon  not above Seven Leagues distant from us But our Endeavours prov'd fruitless for before Eight a Clock she came within Gunshot of us and ply'd us with her forechace Guns tho' without any Damage for not one of the Shot enter'd our Ship which they perceiving left off firing because it retarded their Course and row'd hard to come along side of us which they did in an Hour from their first Firing When they came within Haling they bid us strike that Moment or every Man when we were taken shou'd be flung overboard But we  gave 'em no other Answer than with our great Guns and small Arms which I believe they did not expect But they return'd our Civility with Interest and after plying it warmly on both Sides for half an Hour they boarded us on our Forecastle and those that understood their Language declar'd we shou'd all fall a Sacrifice to their Revenge The Knowledge of that gave us fresh Resolution to fell our Lives as dear as we cou'd but an accidental Shot taking away our Colours the Rovers thought we had struck to 'em which gave 'em some Pause But when they found we continu'd the Fight even to Desperation they fell on furiously again But a lucky Shot from us flew into their PowderRoom and blew up their Quarter within two Foot of the Water This gave us fresh Courage and we clear'd the Deck of all that were alive on Board us They cut off their Grapples and fell a Stern but still ply'd us with their small and great Shot We made all the Sail we cou'd to get out of their way and by degrees left 'em out of Gunshot but found our Ship shot thro' in several Places between Wind and Water and we were forc'd to lie by to stop our Leaks While we were endeavouring to find 'em out it was a great Satisfaction  to me to see the other Ship we saw under the Shore get up with the  Corsair  and engage her they fought furiously about half an Hour but at last overcame her yet that Satisfaction was allay'd by my being inform'd our Leaks cou'd not be found and the Water gain'd upon us notwithstanding they labour'd hard at the Pump The Master immediately made a Signal of Distress and the Ship and Prize came to our Assistance The Ship prov'd a  Spanish Gard de Coste  The Captain came on Board us and very civilly offer'd me a Cabbin of his Lieutenant's who was kill'd in the Engagement with the  Corsair  I was much pleas'd with the Offer and got my Things remov'd on Board The Captain's Name was  Don Juan de Fonseca  his Ship from  Barcelona  of Guns where he was oblig'd to go to refit for this was his second Engagement In the first he had sunk a Rover of  Barbary  who went to the Bottom without saving one Human Creature Our Ship had made shift to stop her Leaks but not so effectually as to pursue her Voyage so after a Consultation the Master determin'd to put into  Toulon  to refit Therefore I resolv'd to accompany the  Spanish  Captain to  Barcelona  having satisfy'd  the  Dutchman  for my Passage I had much ado to make him accept it telling me I had done him more Service than that came to in the Engagement Tho' I my Tutor and Servant had the good Fortune to escape without any Wound in our Bodies yet several Shot had pierc'd our Cloaths The Stock of my Carbine was shot away as I was charging it without doing me any Hurt and the Hat of my Tutor had part of the Brim shot away We lost but three Sailors in the desperate Engagement and five wounded two of which were Passengers Before Night we parted with the  Dutchman  and saw him by the Help of a Telescope enter the Harbour of  Toulon  ere it was dark and we pursu'd our Voyage for  Barcelona  accompany'd with the  Algerine  Prize  The Captain of the  Spaniard  lost nineteen Men in this last Engagement and thirtyfive in the former besides thirty wounded in both so that his Complement was so very much lessen'd that if it had not been for the Help of the GalleySlaves out of the  Corsair  who were most  Spaniards  he cou'd not have work'd his Ship The Captain of the Prize was a  Flemish  Renegade who was intended  to be executed as soon as we arriv'd in  Spain  but a Wound he received in the Groin prevented it for he expir'd before we got into Harbour The rest were  Moors  therefore intended for the Gallies of  Spain  their Complement was Men when they first set out a Roving but they had lost in the Engagement with us besides that were blown up with their Powder and with the  Spaniard Don Juan de Fonseca  made me a Present of a very fine  Turkish  Scimitar adorn'd with wrought Gold which very much pleas'd me and in Return I made him with a great many Intreaties accept of a Gold Watch of  Tompion  's make but I had almost affronted him when I offer'd to satisfy him for my Passage to  Barcelona  where we arriv'd without any Impediment He did me the Honour to introduce me to the Governor and said so many things in my Commendation that made me asham'd to hear 'em But the  Spaniards  are noted for Hyperboles However the Governor us'd me with a great deal of Civility wondering a Person so young shou'd begin his Travels so early and order'd me an Apartment in the Castle and in all the time I continu'd there never press'd me to go to Mass or once ask'd me  concerning my Religion which I was very well pleas'd at for he was assur'd I was a Protestant by my Country  Don Juan de Fonseca  was hardly ever from me and the Civilities I receiv'd from him I shall never forget I found nothing of the stiff formal  Spaniard  in him nor indeed among any I had the Fortune to converse with so that I imagine the general Character of the  Spaniards  we receive in  England  is not altogether true They are certainly cautious concerning their Women yet not all out so much as I expected for I never was introduced into any Family without seeing the Female Part of it but they never stay long in Company or indeed seldom look at any Strangers but when they are spoke to or just upon their Entrance into a Room and when they take their Leave  Barcelona  the  Roman Barcino  is the Capital of the Province of  Catalonia  It was built by  Barca  the  Carthaginian  from whom it takes its Name Though sometimes it was call'd by the  Romans Faventia Colonia  and  Julia Augusta  It was taken from the  Moors  of  Spain  by  Lewis the Pious  Emperor of  Germany  It has two Rivers that wash the North and South Side tho' neither of them  of any great Note The Mole is a very fine one tho' the Harbour being so full of Sand will not permit large Vessels Entrance The Buildings are very handsome tho' it does not exceed  Marseilles  in any thing and for Trade it falls very short I was advis'd by every Body to Winter at  Barcelona  which I resolv'd to do to perfect myself in the  Spanish  Language Nothing extraordinary happen'd to me while I was there tho' Murders were committed almost every Night which is reckon'd nothing there One Gentlewoman was murder'd by her Brother as she came from her Devotion at the Cathedral Church This poor Lady it seems had an Intrigue with one of the Dons of the Place and the Brother came as far as  Toledo  to punish the Stain of his Family as he call'd it and I never knew he was so much as imprison'd for it Another Person of Note was shot thro' the Back as he was making Water against a Wall This Gentleman it seems had been too busy with another Man's Wife as the Rumour went tho' the Adventure was forgot the next Day  The Death of one Gentleman gave me some Concern having some Knowledge of him He was a Person of good Extraction  but his Family was fallen to Decay He made his Addresses to a beautiful Lady and gain'd her Affection but the Parents of the Lady got him a Post to the  WestIndies  not out of Love but to get him out of the way However the enamour'd Couple corresponded together by Letter for two Years In the mean time her Parents resolv'd to wed her against her Will to a rich  Spaniard  of Quality that was in Love with her The young Lady sent Word to her Lover of her unhappy Marriage that was approaching and attempted to make her Escape but was prevented by the Infidelity of her Confidant The Gentleman understanding how Matters went resign'd his Post in the  Indies  and arriv'd at  Barcelona  ten Days after the fatal Marriage was consummated The News almost broke his Heart and his Passion was so violent that he cast many ways to get a Sight of his Mistress and at last obtain'd it They had several Meetings at a Friend's House of the Gentleman's but I was inform'd by a Person that knew the Affair that all their Meetings were very innocent At last they were discover'd by the new Husband who hir'd several Bravos that did their Work so well the poor Gentleman was murder'd as he was  just entring the Door where his Mistress waited for him Some time after the Husband met with the same Fate as he came from visiting a new Mistress Some suppos'd the Wife had a Hand in the Murder but it was never found out and the Lady went into a Monastery Before I left  Barcelona  I receiv'd a Letter from my dear  Isabella  with several from my Uncle and Father that of  Isabella  's was as follows  MY LIFE  I  THOUGHT I never shou'd have heard from you more And tho' I allow'd of the Difficulty of sending to  England  at all times yet I began to have the utmost Uneasiness But now I know the Reason of it my Fears are redoubled Your Tutor has wrote an Account to your Uncle of your Engagement with a  Corsair  of  Barbary  where he declares you were their  GuardianAngel  Consider my Love you have two Lives to answer for that of your own and I hope of your  Isabella  's tho' yours is far more dear to me than my own If the Love you profess'd to me be not a Fiction do not trust the Sea but with the utmost Necessity You have prov'd it an unconstant Element already and more Dangers attend it than Storms  and Shipwrecks you may go from  Barcelona  to  Italy  if you please by Land for I am now grown a Mistress in  Geography  and  Love  was my Teacher I thought that Face and Heart too tender to fight with any thing therefore as I am deceiv'd in that I tremble to think you may deceive me in your Love No question but  France Spain  and  Italy  have Beauties enough to put the strongest Faith to a dangerous Trial But if your Love shou'd cease don't put an end to Pity keep it a Secret for shou'd I once know you false 'twill end the Life of your  ISABELLA  P S  I am concern'd to let you know that I am persecuted afresh by him you have often call'd your Rival but be assur'd while I have my Faculties you shall never have any Rival in my Heart which is and ever shall be entirely thine  This Letter was the only Joy I receiv'd all the while I was at  Barcelona  tho' I was disturb'd at the Account of my Rival's renewing his Addresses The Governor ask'd me if I had not gain'd a Mistress since my Arrival and when I answer'd him in the Negative he seem'd surpriz'd Sure said  he you must have a very insensible Heart not to feel the Charms of Love in so warm a Climate where it is almost the chief Business of the Nation But alas he knew little of my Soul which felt the Pangs of Love in a much colder Climate than  Spain  I receiv'd so many Civilities from this Gentleman that very much perplex'd me because I had nothing extraordinary to make him a Return and to add to the Obligations I had to him when I left  Barcelona  he gave me Leave to redeem a Slave from the Galleys which is esteem'd the greatest Honour can be done to any Stranger Tho' I did not take so much Time to examine the Demerits of the Criminals as a Nobleman did who having the same Honour done him ask'd all the Slaves the Crimes that brought them into that Condition but every one of 'em to the last Man told him they were either put in by Malice or Mistake But the last Man told him frankly He cou'd not say but he was put in very justly for taking a Purse in  Tarragona  without the Consent of the Owner The Duke upon this gave him a Stroke with his Cane You Rogue said he what do you here among such a Parcel of honest innocent Fellows Get about your Business The Person  I redeem'd was both old and unhealthy and therefore I thought him the properest Person among 'em that he might have the Satisfaction of ending the Remainder of his Days in Freedom  I observ'd a gloomy Melancholy had seiz'd my Tutor and tho' I strove all I cou'd to divert him yet I found it to no Purpose neither cou'd I prevail upon him to know the Cause of his Sorrow he only answer'd me that it was his natural Disposition But I saw too much of him not to know his Disease lay in the Mind yet had Hope Time and the various Climates we shou'd visit wou'd cure him but hitherto his Malady increas'd One Day when I was retir'd to my Closet to write some Letters to  England  he came into the Room not knowing I was there and for some time sigh'd and wept bitterly at last he broke out into something like the following Complaint Sure never wretched Mortal ever felt the Pains and Disappointments that I have undergone They are too great to bear Allseeing Heaven that inflicts these Punishments upon us creeping Things sure will forgive us if we seek a Remedy by Death for nought but Death can cure my Misfortunes As he was going  on with his Complaints I purposely made a Rumbling in my Closet which he hearing was going down Stairs but I prevented him by opening the ClosetDoor and call'd him back Well Governor said I will you still persist in Grief and yet tell me you have nothing troubles you I am sorry you betray a want of Confidence in me whom I would have you reckon among the Number of your Friends and you may command every thing in my Power as such Sir answer'd my Governor in much Confusion I am convinc'd of your Goodness to me and therefore have in a short Narrative written the Account of my Misfortunes which I intended for your Perusal after my Death and when you have consider'd 'em I am well assur'd you will not blame me for cutting off my Cares with my Life I shall blame you for nothing I reply'd but your persisting in that melancholy Thought Consider the Task you have undertaken that of returning me safe to my Uncle Also remember Time works many strange Cures of the Mind as well as the Body In common Calamities I own reply'd my Tutor Time is a very good Physician but when the Malady is lodg'd in the Soul and no Balm to heal it on  this side the Grave Time only makes the Burden too heavy to be born However I own there is a Duty incumbent upon me on your Account and I will lay aside my Resolution of Dying till you have perus'd this fatal Account of my unfortunate Life and then I doubt not but you will out of Compassion dismiss me to the peaceful Grave When he had done speaking he put into my Hands the following Relation  THE HISTORY OF CLERIMONT  MY Family is not of the meanest tho' I was born to suffer unheardof Misfortunes thro' an unhappy Passion In my Youth I was brought up in the  Roman  Persuasion but being left to the Care of an Uncle a Clergyman of the Protestant Religion  he soon wip'd away the Notions I had receiv'd from my Infancy of the  Roman  Faith But as it little concerns my wretched Life to relate any thing farther of my Minority I shall step at once into my melancholy Story  After leaving the University my Uncle took me to dwell with him intending as soon as possible I shou'd take my Degrees in order to procure me a Living but in the mean time Fate was at work Riding one SummerEvening to take the Air the Sun so powerfully shone upon me that I was constrain'd to go to the Skirts of a Wood for Shelter from his fiery Beams The Place being inviting I got from my Horse and laid me down upon the Grass setting myself to read and insensibly fell asleep but was awak'd with the Neighing of a Horse in the neighbouring Wood which I found was my own that had slipt off his Bridle and left me taking the Bridle in my Hand I went to catch him but being a Horse of Spirit he led me from Place to Place not suffering me to come near him I was so much fatigu'd in following him that I was constrain'd once more to sit down and let him graze in my Sight In a few Moments I heard the Neighing of another Horse in the adjacent Thicket  which mine soon answer'd and gallop'd that way the Noise proceeded from I was oblig'd once more to rise and follow him and at last came up with him where I found him playing his Pranks with another Horse and a Gentleman whipping him to get 'em asunder but with the Bustle the other Horse got loose also and away they ran together kicking and biting each other so that each of us fear'd the Loss of his Horse As I was going to follow 'em once more I heard a Female Voice call to me  For Heaven's sake Sir  said she  if you're a Man succour a distress'd Woman who is in danger of losing her Honour and her Life  Tho' I did not set up for a KnightErrant Curiosity and Humanity made me turn back where  rceiv'd a Woman ty'd by her Hair to the Stump of a Tree all bloody the Sight very much surpriz'd me but as I was going to release her the Gentleman that was pursuing the other Horse cry'd out to me Villain if thou offerest to set her at Liberty this Moment is thy last Turning about I saw him within ten Paces with his Sword drawn running upon me I had no Weapon therefore thought it adviseable to desist and expostulate with him but he wou'd not hear Reason nor tell me  the Meaning of this Adventure I was in a very great Dilemma between his Threats and the persuasive Rhetoric of the suffering Lady but at last resolv'd notwithstanding the apparent Danger to release her if possible but as soon as he perceiv'd my Intention he ran at me with his Sword crying Nay then take thy Death first Having my Bridle in my Hand I struck at him with a good Force and by good Providence struck his Sword out of his Hand and as he stoop'd to take it up I repeated my Blow upon his Head and the Bridle being a Curb I stun'd him with the Stroke so that he lay speechless grovelling on the Earth and I run to free the Lady But finding some Difficulty and hot regarding the Man he was got up and running once more upon me with his Sword which I shou'd have secur'd wou'd infallibly have dispatch'd me if the Lady had not cry'd out yet I cou'd not avoid being run thro' the Side tho' no more than a Flesh Wound he then seiz'd me and we struggled together a long time but he being very strong and I weak with my Wound he got me down and with the Fall the Sword flew out of my Side I grasp'd him close about the Neck so that he cou'd hardly breathe  but he must have made an End of me if the Lady had not releas'd herself with the Assistance I had given her before who took up his Sword and run him into the Leg the Pain of which made him let go his Hold of me and I got up again snatch'd the Sword from him which he had drawn out of his Leg and struck him so forcibly over his Head that I once more sent him breathless to the Ground I was just going to run the Sword into his Body in my Heat of Passion but I consider'd immediately it wou'd look like an Action of Barbarity to stab a defenceless Man therefore I desisted and in a few Moments after I fell speechless by him with Loss of Blood but was brought to my Senses by a violent Pain in my Leg that the barbarous Wretch had given me in wounding me several times with his Penknife as I lay uncapable of Defence  He did his utmost to reach my Breast but he was so feeble with his Wounds that he cou'd not get any farther I rose in a violent Passion and wrench'd it from him intending to put an End to his Life but my feebler Strength cou'd not obey my Fury therefore I seated myself as far from him as I cou'd expecting my last Moments for the Lady was  fled and little Hopes of Succour appear'd we being in a Wood above a Mile from any Road I had nothing now to do but make my Peace with Heaven While I was meditating I perceiv'd five Men with the Wretch's Horse coming towards us As soon as he perceiv'd 'em he cry'd out with all the Transport his Strength wou'd allow of Now Villain thy wretched Fate approaches Here said he to one of the Fellows take that Villain that has in this manner basely abus'd your Master and hew him to Pieces Notwithstanding I thought Death was near without any farther Violence yet I was resolv'd to defend myself as well as I cou'd therefore snatch'd up the Sword that lay near me and put my Back against a Tree for without that Support I had not Strength to stand the Villains one and all came furiously towards me but I kept 'em some time from wounding me by means of the Sword thrusting the most eager of 'em into the Throat But finding my Strength failing me I made one Effort before I fainted and thrust my Sword into the Body of their Master who was endeavouring to rise falling upon him at the same time for want of Strength That Moment several Country Fellows came rushing  upon the Servants of the inhuman Villain and drove 'em out of the Wood wounding several of 'em two of 'em came to me and supported me while another that was a Surgeon examin'd my Wounds Have Courage said he Sir your Hurts are not dangerous tho' your Loss of Blood makes you faint I thank'd 'em for their seasonable Assistance which was surely sent from Heaven for one Moment longer must have brought me inevitable Death Sir said the Surgeon the Lady whom you rescu'd sent us to your Assistance who will be here immediately to return you the Acknowledgments due for such a signal Service  After my Wounds were dress'd the Surgeon went to examine the Wretch that lay speechless with his Sword in his Body upon drawing it out he gave two or three Groans and open'd his Eyes staring wildly about him for some time When he found how Matters went What said he does that Villain live still Yes I reply'd Heaven guards the Good and the Title of Villain properly belongs to thee who wou'd oppress Virtue and wrong the Innocent and thy Treatment of her and me has been so barbarous that if thy Crimes do not draw the  Punishment of Heaven upon thee I will seek thee out and endeavour to chastise thee in a manner that shall shew thee I have not forgot I'm a Gentleman tho' thou art of the Brute Creation and only bearest the outward Form of Man I'd give reply'd the Brute half my Estate to have it in my Power to scourge thy Presumption He wou'd have said more but the Probing of his Wounds made him faint Before they had made an end of Dressing him the Lady arriv'd attended with several Servants Thank Heaven said she the Preserver of my Life and Honour lives How shall I shew my grateful Acknowledgments I reply'd I had done nothing but what every honest Man wou'd have done or ought to have done  This Surgeon interrupted our Discourse by informing the Lady it wou'd be dangerous for me to talk much But I cou'd not avoid speaking with my Eyes for I found my Heart insensibly leaving me The Charms of the Fair One were too powerful to be withstood tho' ruffled and disorder'd by this unlucky Accident After the Surgeon had dress'd the Wretch the Cause of this Disaster he ask'd the Lady what must be done with him Leave him said she to consort with his FellowCreatures  the Beasts of the Field for Human Society will disown him Immediately after the Countrymen return'd bringing along with them three of the Servants they had taken all of 'em very much wounded There said the Lady take your villainous Master and shut him in some dark Cave for 'tis not sit he shou'd breathe common Air with honest Men and you continu'd she must be Brutes like him to serve such a Monster The Servants made their Excuse as well as they cou'd urging their Master's Commands and promising for the future never to be Partners in his Crimes if they continu'd with him Well reply'd the Lady learn to be honest and Heaven will forgive you Take the Wretch your Master and bear him where I may never see him more perhaps he may also repent since he finds his Punishment comes from Heaven The ablest of the Fellows got upon his Master's Horse which was brought along with mine by the Countrymen and his Master was laid along before him hardly sensible of what they did But I was so weak and faint they were oblig'd to cut Boughs and make a Hurdle on which I was laid and carry'd to a fair House about two Miles from the Wood yet notwithstanding my Weakness I found  a secret Pleasure in being under the same Roof with a Woman that had intirely robb'd me of my Heart  My Wounds made me keep my Chamber several Weeks tho' I had the Happiness of seeing my Fair One twice a Day during my Illness and my Passion increas'd with my Strength One Day before I left my Chamber I begg'd her to inform me how a Woman of her Condition cou'd be brought into such a dangerous Adventure Sir said she by base Treachery which I will inform you in as few Words as possible  This Wretch for I cannot call him Gentleman tho' blind Fortune has bestow'd her Favours upon him in a lavish manner long courted me in vain tho' my Father who is now abroad prest me very much to accept him for a Husband blinded by his vast Riches yet my Heart disdain'd him When my Father went into  Spain  to settle his Affairs I forbid him the House and order'd the Servants whenever he came to visit me to shut the Doors against him This Treatment put him in such a Passion that he broke my Windows and endeavour'd to come in by Force threatning to murder all my Family Such impudent Proceedings oblig'd me to have my Country  Neighbours in my House as a Guard from his insolent Fury this was not only troublesome but expensive However tir'd with his Attempts to no Purpose he left off his Persecution and I began to recover my former Tranquillity Near four Months past without my once hearing of him and when I did I was inform'd he was making his Addresses to a Lady on the other Side of the Country The News was infinitely pleasing to me and I durst once more venture abroad as usual  One Day my Woman that had been my Servant from my Infancy begg'd I wou'd be Godmother to a Grandchild of hers whose Parents liv'd in a Village about five Miles from my Dwelling I cou'd not refuse such a trifling Request tho' it was an Office I did not take any great Delight in When the Day came I was oblig'd to go on Horseback attended with one ManServant and my Woman for my Coachman was ill of a Fever When we came within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wood where Heaven sent you to my Assistance my Woman call'd to mind she had forgot some little Presents I had intended for the Mother and the Child therefore she sent the Footman in a Hurry back  for 'em while we propos'd to ride on softly till he overtook us As we came within a few Yards of the Wood my Horse gave a Start at something and looking towards the Wood I perceiv'd to my dreadful Surprize the Villain that brought me to the Distress you rescu'd me from He flew out of the Wood and on the Instant seiz'd my Horse by the Bridle Come Madam said he we may now converse together without scaling Walls to come at you Fear had so ty'd my Tongue that I cou'd not give him any Answer but when I found him leading my Horse to the Wood I jump'd off and ran towards the Plain as fast as my Fear wou'd permit but to no Purpose he soon overtook me and bore me by Force into the Wood maugre all my complaining Sighs  When he had hurry'd me about a Furlong I perceiv'd five or six of the Villain's Servants they immediately seiz'd me and put me before him on Horseback he ordering them at the same time to catch my Horse and wait at a certain Place in the Wood till he came to them The Barbarian then carry'd me to a more unfrequented Part of the Wood where he proceeded to fill my Ears with his nauseous Courtship but still threaten'd  to use Force if I did not immediately comply I try'd by all the Persuasion I was Mistress of to prevent his horrid Purpose telling him Time might produce strange things and if he wou'd forbear any Violence I wou'd give him leave to visit me as usual No no Madam that's only a Wile reply'd the Monster to get out of my Power but I'll do the Deed and then leave you to determine whether you will send for me or no When I found Intreaties wou'd not prevail I call'd Heaven and Earth to my Assistance but to no Purpose He then proceeded to Violence using the most horrid Imprecations that he would satiate his most abominable Lust and then murder me to conceal the Deed  I resisted as long as my weak Strength wou'd permit but he at last overpower'd me so far as to bind me to the Root of the Tree where you found me and no doubt had fulfill'd his damnable Purpose if your timely Assistance had not sav'd me When I found my Deliverer in such imminent Danger pursu'd the Lady I took up his Sword with an Intention to have kill'd the Villain but using the Weapon with fearful Aukwardness wounded him only in the Leg and  perceiving you faint ran out of the Wood to seek for Succour by good Fortune I met the Surgeon and my Servant returning who got together some of my Father's Tenants that were Haymaking in the Meads near the Wood  As we came to your Succour I saw my Woman lie upon the Ground bleeding I ran to her Assistance but she cry'd Good Madam trouble not yourself with a Wretch that has basely betray'd you but Heaven has punish'd me for my Perfidy and all I ask is Forgiveness from That and you She inform'd me that my intended Ravisher had given her  l  to betray me to him in the Manner I have related I ask'd her how she came thus wounded She answer'd me by the Hand of Heaven as she was waiting till  he odious Deed was finish'd a Horse came galloping out of the Wood and running furiously upon the Beast she was on the Creature in a Fright ran away with that Swiftness she cou'd neither stop him nor get from off his Back till he threw her down her Foot hanging in the Stirrup she was dragg'd  ill the Stirrup broke and left her in the Conflition I found her in I was surpriz'd at this Treachery because I little suspected it tho'  it was obvious enough yet the Hurry of my Spirits never gave me Leisure once to think upon any thing but your Safety  The Surgeon however was about to dress her but she push'd him from her telling him his Art was vain for she was that Moment expiring and accordingly she breath'd her last begging Forgiveness of me and Heaven Maugre the Resentment I had against her I cou'd not help shedding a few Tears for her Loss  The rest of my Story you are sufficiently acquainted with since you hazarded your Life to save me from the Ravisher who as we are inform'd is expired of his Wounds and tho' I am a Creature so far from wishing the Death of any one that I wou'd give all I am worth to save an innocent Person's Life yet I can't help being pleas'd at his Death since it frees me from the Apprehension of Suffering from his Brutal Temper which I am assur'd never will be chang'd  To make my Tale as short as possible I will freely declare to you dear Sir that I gain'd her Heart tho' she protested she wou'd never wed till the Death of her Father without his Consent but that I almost despair'd of considering the Disparity of our  Fortunes Besides he was accounted the most penurious Wretch on Earth This gave a Damp to the Joy I receiv'd when she gave me an Assurance of her Heart tho' she vow'd she would suffer a thousand Deaths rather than give her Hand to any one but her Deliverer as she was pleas'd to call me  During my Cure no Man ever thought himself so happy as I did belov'd and ever in the Presence of her I lov'd tho' we conceal'd our Passions from all the World But my Wounds being heal'd Decency requir'd I shou'd be gone tho' our Separation was equal to the Pangs of Death All our Consolation was in our Intercourse of Letters and sometimes meeting as by Accident  A few Days after our Parting the Father to my Fair One arriv'd from  Spain  She sent me a Note wherein she advis'd me to make him a Visit and endeavour to insinuate myself into his Favour I waited on him accordingly but was very much surpris'd at my Reception instead of giving me Thanks for the timely Assistance I gave his Daughter he seem'd very much out of Humour with me and in an odd stiff formal manner told me The World had been censorious upon his Daughter on my Account and therefore  desired I wou'd never enter his Doors again I found to my Grief there was nothing to be done with him in favour of my Love therefore took my Leave with a Heart full of the greatest Sorrow Yet notwithstanding the Danger we continu'd our Correspondence tho' with a thousand Fears  I kept nothing a Secret from my good Uncle who persuaded me to forget my Passion but that was the only Thing I cou'd not obey him in The Knowledge of it gave him a great deal of Uneasiness tho' he was so just to pity me and hop'd Time might work a Cure  One Day as I was going in Disguise to the Place where I was to receive a Letter from my Love I saw in the Road a Country Fellow grovelling in the Dust when I came up to him he inform'd me with a great deal of Pain that his Horse had thrown him and with the Violence of his Fall had broke his Leg He intreated me to give him some Assistance Tho' my Time was short for my own Affair Compassion wou'd not suffer me to leave a Man in such Distress and Anguish therefore I caught his Horse that was grazing near and mounting him led him to a neighbouring Village where I procur'd a skilful  Surgeon to attend him but before I took my Leave he begg'd to speak with me in private When every body had left the Room Friend said he for I was drest in a Country Habit I have one Favour more to beg of you which is to take that Letter carry it as directed and for your Pains there's half a Crown but you must do it with all Secrecy Tell the Person you give it to of my unfortunate Condition and upon Return with the Answer I shall reward you by giving you another Half Crown with many Thanks for the Favour As a Crown was a very extraordinary Reward for one in my Habit to go half a Mile I durst not for fear of some Discovery refuse it therefore took the Letter with Promise of a quick Return neither was it out of my way for it was directed to a Person that kept a PublickHouse in the Road where I was to pass  As I pursuing my little Journey I call'd to mind the Person to whom the Letter was directed who had formerly been a Servant to the Father of my Mistress for she once propos'd a Meeting at his House but better considering we found a Place more convenient and less to be suspected I therefore began to be jealous of some ill Design  which possess'd my Fancy so strong that I resolv'd to open the Seal in such a manner that the Arms which further'd my Suspicion shou'd not be defac'd if the Contents were innocent of any ill Intent The first PublicHouse I came at I went in and open'd my Letter where I found to this Effect  SAM  I  SEND the Bearer to you to consult how we shall get that scornful Minx into my Custody The Vessel and all things are in Readiness and the false Report I have caus'd to be spread of my Death will favour my Design I have likewise sent three trusty Rogues to dispatch that Fellow who rescu'd her out of my Hands before for I must have my Revenge as well as Love satisfy'd 'Tis but within these few Days I learnt where he liv'd Tomorrow Night I shall come in Disguise the back Way to your House and bring the other  l  with me Take care of Privacy in my Reception and send your Things to my Retreat that I may put 'em on Board I hope you have overcome that Scruple of parting with your Wife which so much possess'd you when I last saw you Be sure to keep thy Tongue within thy Teeth for if Women are big with a Secret they are in Pain till  they are delivered I'll assure you you may rely on  Tom  the Bearer therefore conceal nothing from him I send you this Letter as his Credentials because you never saw him before as my Ambassador He is faithful for I have try'd him  Yours  c  You may judge my Surprize when I had read this villainous Writing and found my Mistress as well as mysel  in such imminent Danger My Thoughts were in such Confusion and Disorder that I cou'd not determine with myself how I shou  d proceed in this Affair At last I resolv'd to deliver the Letter as directed to see what farther Inlet I cou'd receive in the dangerous Affair I therefore made the best of my way to the House where I fortunately met the Man alone He chang'd Colour in the reading of it several times examining the Seal very circumspectly but that he shou'd have done before he open'd it tho' the nicest Observer even he that sent it cou'd not have discover'd the Letter had been open'd However I cou'd find by his odd Questions he was not overwell satisfy'd with the Bearer observing my Face as if he wou'd look me thro' I began to suspect he might find me  out in my Disguise not being well assur'd but he might have seen me when I was brought wounded from the Wood senseless However at last he began to be a little better compos'd He took some pains to persuade me to drink something but I inform'd him I had Business a little further therefore was oblig'd to return immediately He then made me promise to call as I came back telling me he would go along with me to the Person that sent me to which I agreed and went on to meet my dear Mistress  When I told her the Story of the Letter she cou'd hardly give Credit to it believing her intended Ravisher had been in the Regions of Death But at last being convinc'd he was still living she resolv'd not to stir abroad for fear he shou'd put his wicked Designs in Practice desiring I wou'd do the same tho' I had not inform'd her of my Danger The Grief we felt at Parting almost overcame us and it was with some Difficulty I cou'd bring my Countenance to dissemble my Sorrow when I call'd upon the Innkeeper  After staying some time we set out together but I cou'd plainly perceive his Mind was very much disturb'd In crossing a Meadow we observ'd a Kite had pounc'd a poor  Pidgeon and flew up into a Tree in our way as we pass'd I ran as fast as I cou'd and with Stones frighted him from his Prey The Pidgeon not quite dead flutter'd about the Tree and at last fell at our Feet which I took up Thus it is said I in the World Power Rapine Violence and Lust which stop at nothing to compass their wicked Desires tho' they prey upon Innocence and Virtue yet they often meet with their Reward in this World as well as the next That Kite that left the innocent Pidgeon in that Condition has every one for its Enemy while the poor Pidgeon is pity'd But Birds are instigated by Nature to what they do the Kite was compell'd by Hunger and Necessity to seek his Prey but vicious Man preys upon his FellowCreature out of Wantonness or Revenge Your Reflexion reply'd the Innkeeper seems something above your Condition and I will freely declare very much surprises me therefore beg the Favour to be answer'd one Question sincerely I told him I wou'd Why then said he do you know any thing of the Person that gave you the Letter or any thing relating to the Contents Or do you know the Gentleman who sent that Messenger Tho' I must own I abhor an  Untruth yet I thought it wou'd not be convenient to declare what I knew therefore answer'd in the Negative The Man was some time before he spoke looking stedfastly upon me all the while At last he broke Silence to this Purpose Friend I know not your Condition yet do verily believe you are not what you seem but be that as it may I have in this short Acquaintance such a strong Opinion of your Wisdom and Integrity by your Countenance and Discourse that I shall discover a very important Secret to you upon this Condition that you will never disclose it give me your Advice and not endeavour to prejudice me I reply'd his Confidence in me oblig'd me to be his Friend Come then said he let us go out of this Path for Hedges and Ditches may have Ears as well as Walls as the Saying is  When we came to a convenient Place we sat down and he related to me all the Passages of what I knew before concerning the Family of my Mistress and my own Adventure how the Wretch who sent him the Letter had prevail'd upon him to betray the young Lady his former Mistress for  l  into his Hands and fly with him into the  WestIndies  where he had a large Estate and  shou'd be shrouded from the Law Now I must own the Money has a prevailing Power and my Poverty pleads for the Gentleman besides I have a Wife that has of late given me Proof how much she strives to send me to Heaven by adorning my Brows But yet I have a Conscience for my Monitor that every Moment tells me I am about a wicked Deed And this Letter I have receiv'd which you was the Bearer of has stagger'd my Resolution for I find by the Contents an innocent Gentleman is to be murder'd for doing a noble and a generous Action therefore the first thing I shall desire of you before you give me your Advice is to promise me you will go to such a Place naming my Uncle's House and inform the young Gentleman his Nephew of the Danger he is in for tho' I have no Knowledge of him yet I know his Uncle to be a Person who is an Honour to the Habit he wears and has the Goodwill of every Body When I had read the Letter I affected to be very much astonish'd at such a Design in a Kingdom famous for the Goodness of its Laws where such Crimes are punish'd with Death and told him the Danger he run in such a vile Proceeding the Usage he must expect from such a Villain when he  had him once in his Power and the Reward might be taken from him nay perhaps Death might be his Payment from such a barbarous Wretch that he might have the fewer to maintain  He allow'd all I said for Oracles yet he was still hankering after the  l  It wou'd be a Piece of Justice cry'd the Innkeeper even to bite him of it I cannot deny but it wou'd I reply'd but I think that impracticable I wish we cou'd contrive reply'd he to let him run away with my Wife I then shou'd get  l  and be rid of a base Woman that has made me a Cuckold The Letter seems to intimate said I that you had some Scruples in parting with her That's true reply'd the Innkeeper for when he first mov'd me about this wicked Business I had only a Jealousy of her Falshood but since I have prov'd it I despise her as much as I lov'd her yet I have even conceal'd my Knowledge of her Falshood tho' I was an Eyewitness of it I began to inquire further into the Affair and found he had Reason enough to get rid of his Wife therefore we spent some Time in Conference about bringing this Affair to bear but cou'd not think of any probable Means Come cry'd the  Innkeeper since we can't think to any Purpose let me intreat you to go and prevent the young Gentleman's Fate The young Gentleman said I is safe enough for to let you into a Secret in return of yours I am the very Person in this Disguise  The Innkeeper was Thunderstruck at what I told him and seem'd willing to be rid of his Companion but I brought him to himself by good Words and some Money which I gave him as I told him for his Intention to save my Life I own said he it seems a Mark of Providence in my meeting with you and therefore I abhor myself for my wicked Intention and shall never set my Mind at rest till I have gain'd Forgiveness from Heaven and you We were interrupted in our farther Discourse by a Person that cross'd the Meadow with a FishingRod in his Hand tho' he was so intent to get over the Hedge to the River that ran near it that he saw us not That is said the Innkeeper the Villain that has seduc'd my Wife my Blood rises at him I have a good mind to run after him and push him into the River Hold said I why did not you shew your Resentment when you caught him in the Act and revenge yourself Because said he my  Blood was froze with Horror and I had not the Power to stir Well then I reply'd let him alone now for I have something in my Head that may be of Service to you not only to get rid of your Wife but to fecure the  l  too Did your Wife ever receive any Letters from him to your Knowledge I believe not reply'd the Innkeeper for when he comes a Fishing he generally lies at our House so that they have Opportunities enough of Conversation without writing to each other Why then said I contain your self a little go to the Angler and tell him your Wife has betray'd herself to you and forbid him your House Or if you don't like that Method take any other to prevent his coming to your Habitation but don't use any indirect Means Well reply'd my Host I'll take your Advice about the Calmness of my Mind tho' I shan't proceed in the other Affair quite according to your Direction for I think after owning myself a Cuckold to my Cuckoldmaker nothing shou'd follow but his Destruction  I staid about half an Hour inly ruminating upon my unhappy Condition before he return'd I have don't cry'd my Host I believe he won't come to my House in haste  I hope you have not murder'd him said I No no I proceeded in another manner By reading a Letter he carelesly dropt once I found he ow'd a considerable Sum of Money to a certain Person in  London  who threaten'd to trouble him Remembring the Person's Name I went up to him as he was Fishing and told him I was glad I had met with him for there were Officers to arrest him at our House at the Suit of suchaone He seem'd surpris'd as not doubting the Truth and begg'd I wou'd stand his Friend in his Concealment therefore I have sent him to a Cousin of mine that keeps an Inn about Ten Miles off with a Promise to come and inform him when the Officers are gone You have done well said I and now I'll inform you of my Design  You shall write a Letter in answer to that I brought you where you shall mention that you shall have the Lady in your Possession ready for him to take her away tomorrow The Letter I will indite for you which you shall transcribe And then I'll write another as from the Angler to your Wife to tell her that you have discover'd your Jealousy to him and forbid him your House but that if she consent to fly with  him tomorrow Night he will come attended with some Friends and bring her to a Place of Safety Very well reply'd my Companion I understand you and so put my Wife upon the Gentleman instead of the Lady a rare Contrivance if it succeeds Come said I let us go to a House and write the Letters that we may lose no Time I wrote to the Villain that does not deserve the Name of Man in this manner  SIR  I  Receiv'd yours and have succeeded to my Wish I have found by an extraordinary Accident that your Mistress is in Love with the Person who rescu'd her from you in the Wood and she is to come tomorrow Night to be conducted to him by some of his Friends from my House Therefore you must not speak a Word when you take her away till we are safe on Board Come early for fear we shou'd meet with those Persons she expects tho' I hope your Emissaries will prevent him by cutting his Throat And don't forget my Reward for I am not Heroe enough to venture my Life for nothing Be assur'd if I have the Money the Woman is yours  Ay marry cry'd mine Host as he was writing it this will do What I wrote to his Wife you have as follows  MY DEAR  THE Cuckold your Husband met me today as I was angling and forbid me the House having discover'd our Intimacy one Night in the Arbour in the Garden therefore if you will fly with me tomorrow Night I will send some trusty Servants to conduct you to my own Habitation where you shall command my House as your own and if we can by any Contrivance dispose of your Hornify'd Spouse it shall be your own Fault if you are not my lawful Wife Take no care of what you leave behind you for I will provide every thing for you rich and of the best Send your Answer by the Bearer whom I can trust but send it in Writing seal'd with the Seal I gave you  those Words were put in at my Host's Request to strengthen the Contents  and be ready but don't speak a Word till you see me for one of the Persons I have employ'd to conduct you imagines it is a rich Heiress I have stole one that he knows and if you speak will discover you by your Voice Rest contented and be happy in the Embraces of your constant  L M  Right still cry'd my Host But who will be the Bearer I told him I wou'd carry it myself while he went on to the maim'd Fellow that brought the Letter and sent him away hurt as he was to his Master We agreed to part but I promis'd him I would come after him and consult farther  When I arriv'd at my Host's I found his Wife trick'd up like a Dutchess and to give her her Due she seem'd an agreeable Woman She took the Letter with some Confusion which something alarm'd me for fear she might know his Hand She went into another Room and return'd immediately with a Bottle of Wine and a cold Chicken and put Half a Guinea into my Hand Friend said she if my Husband shou'd come and catch you and suspect there's Money to pay your Reckoning if not it is to pay you for your Trouble I thank'd her as much like a Countryman as I cou'd Upon which she went out and staid some time When she return'd she gave me a Letter Give that said she with my humble Service to the Person that sent you and tell him It's very well  When I had got my Commission I made what Haste I cou'd to my Landlord and  found him helping up the Countryman upon his Horse and the Surgeon cursing and swearing at the Folly of the Fellow to get on Horseback in that Condition However go he must the Fellow said if he dy'd by the Way But the Man of the House sent one to attend him to his Master's and we staid till the Fellow return'd which he did in three Hours telling his Master he had conducted him safe home In the mean time we examin'd the Letter I brought from my generous Landlay which was to this Effect  That she wou'd fly to the World's End with him and live upon Roots and Water to enjoy his sweet Company and leave that despicable Wretch her Husband whom she loath'd as much as she lov'd him  c A brave Wife by my Troth cry'd my Landlord  When I gave him the HalfGuinea she made me a Present of he said it was well there were not real Bailiffs at his House for Mr Angler for his Wife by her extraordinary Bounty to the LetterCarrier wou'd certainly pay her Lover's Debts if she cou'd any way raise the Money My Thoughts now began to return homeward but my Companion told me he wou'd not leave me till he saw me safe at my Uncle's for fear the  Wretches shou'd discover me I thank'd him and accepted of his Company because I was to shift my Disguise by the way and consequently might be murder'd in going from thence to my Uncle's for he knew not of my Transformation neither shou'd I have gone home till our Designs had been accomplish'd if it had not been that my Uncle wou'd have been frighten'd at my Absence Therefore we agreed to go both together and my Landlord to lodge in the Neighbourhood of my Uncle and both return the next Day to wait the Issue of our Project  When we came to the House where I was to dress the Person told me there were three Men had been with him to know where my Uncle liv'd and ask'd several Questions concerning me but said he I did not like their Turn of Discourse therefore gave 'em no Intelligence so they proceeded on their way I told him he had acted wisely for they were Wretches that had a Design upon my Life If so said he looking out be upon your Guard for here they come up the Lane I had not pull'd off my Disguise therefore ventur'd out of the Door keeping my Hand upon a Brace of PocketPistols I always carry'd about me since my Rencounter with that  Wretch one of 'em rid up to me and ask'd me if I had seen Mr Suchaone naming my Name Mr  Clerimont  said I speaking in a Country Manner yes he'll be here presently I wait for him by his own Order I am glad on't reply'd the Fellow for I have some earnest Business to communicate to him and was inform'd at his Uncle's that he had not been at home since Morning therefore with your Leave we'll wait here till he comes With all my Heart said I if you please you may alight and put up your Horses No reply'd the Fellow our Horses are hot therefore we'll ride softly up and down to cool 'em and when he arrives if you'll come and acquaint us I'll give thee something Thank ye Master said I I'll be sure to do it Upon this they rode off I watch'd 'em some time and found they were very busy in Consultation In the mean time I instructed the Man of the House to go to the Constable and bring a sufficient Force along with him But before he went out they all three return'd and alighting from their Horses they desir'd I wou'd put 'em into the Stable for they were now cool telling me they would accept of my Offer and wait there till Mr  Clerimont  came Well Gentlemen said I for his sake  you shall be welcome to what the House affords Come sit down The Fellows seem'd a little shy however they sat down at last and began to be very free with the Liquor we gave 'em and we ply'd 'em so close that in two Hours we did not want the Constable's Assistance to secure 'em for they were all three drunk to a Degree  When the Constable came I order'd him to keep out of Sight till I sent for him I began then to examine the soberest of 'em asking him what Business he had with Mr  Clerimont  Not said I but if I look into your Hand I need not ask the Question for I am so skill'd in Palmistry that I can tell things past present and to come that is to say in plain  English  reply'd the Man you are a Conjuror However to try your Skill there's my Hand do your best and spare not This Hand said I has receiv'd in part or will receive shortly the Price of innocent Blood The Man drunk as he was seem'd to be in the utmost Confusion yet endeavour'd to hide it by pulling back his Hand It is in vain to conceal it from me said I you and your Companions are hir'd to murder that  Clerimont  you so earnestly enquire for and the Constable  is now in the House to apprehend you  This spoke with a confident Air made him turn pale for his other two Companions were fast asleep But still he put it off as a Jest till I call'd in the Constable Here Constable said I take these three Rogues into Custody and see 'em well secur'd till tomorrow They came here with an Intention to murder me I having sufficient Witnesses to prove it against them And are you that  Clerimont  cry'd the Fellow I had been talking to Yes said I Now let me know what is your Business with me Turn every body out of the Chamber reply'd he and I will convince you we had no such Intention I told him I thought it was impossible However after searching 'em for Arms and finding none I order'd the Room to be clear'd Sir said the Man how you got your Intelligence is a very great Mystery to me but we three were certainly sent from such a Person to murder you for the Reward of  l  a Man and after we had made an end of you we were to imbark with him for the  WestIndies  We receiv'd  l  a Man as Earnest of the rest but resolv'd not to commit so barbarous an Act upon the Innocent  therefore we intended to acquaint you with the real Truth hoping you would cause the Report to be spread of your Murder about your Neighbourhood for a few Days till we had receiv'd the Reward and our Master had imbark'd I own you may hardly find Faith to believe me but it is Truth as I hope for Heaven You may perceive we have no Arms about us and if you please to examine our Pistols at our Holsters you will find they are as empty as my Master's Heart is of Humanity  I immediately sent to examine their Pistols and found 'em uncharg'd as he declar'd This Proof gain'd on my Belief Well Sir said the Man I hope you think what I have said is Truth But the more to strengthen it Pray awake my Companions and examine them Now what Discourse we had together was spoke so low that if the other two Men had been awake and sober they cou'd not have understood us Therefore I caus'd 'em to be rous'd from their drousy Humour while I went and put on my own Cloaths When I came in I order'd the Person I had been talking with to tell 'em he had seen me Well and have you broke the Matter to him said one of 'em Yes he reply'd and  I do intend to comply with his Request We are glad on't return'd the other two then our Fourscore Pounds apiece is all snug I found upon a further Examination the Fellows were honest Nay one of 'em told me it was not altogether the Lucre of the Money that prevail'd upon him but to save an innocent Gentleman's Life for said he if we had not undertaken it some others might that wou'd have gone through with their Work  The Difficulty I now labour'd under was which way to cause the Report of my Death without alarming my Uncle therefore took this Method which was approv'd of by the three Men I put on my Disguise once more and gave 'em the Cloaths I put off which we mangled and blooded in several Places and order'd 'em to tell the Wretch who sent 'em that they found me hunting in a Wood alone and there murder'd me and the Place being private not likely for any one to find me immediately they had stript me and brought my Cloaths as a Proof that my Business was done effectually They all three gave me many Thanks and promis'd me in a few Days to let me know their Success for they were resolv'd to leave their  Master secretly as soon as ever they had receiv'd their Reward not caring to live any longer with such a barbarous Wretch Upon this we parted and my Host and I went to our Repose The next Morning I dispatch'd mine Host to regulate Matters with my hated Rival and design'd to follow I told my Uncle I intended to go see a Relation about Twenty Miles off and shou'd not return till the next Day for I did not think it proper to acquaint him with the Motive of my Journey I went in my usual Disguise but durst not go to the Landlord's House because his Wife wou'd know me for the LetterCarrier therefore chose to ride into a neighbouring Wood till it was dark where I entertain'd myself with a Book I brought along with me But I was very much surpriz'd an Hour before Night to see the Wretch and two more along with him enter the same Wood I began to have some dreadful Apprehension for fear they shou'd find me out therefore leading my Horse further into the Wood and tying him fast fetch'd a Round and came almost at their Backs yet tho' I was so near 'em they cou'd not come to me immediately by reason of the Interposition of a thick Copse of Hazels  which kept me from their Sight Now my Revenge is satisfy'd cry'd the Villain my Heart feels lighter and it looks like an Omen of future Contentment in possessing that ungrateful Maid I must own I do love her and wou'd wait a Year with Patience if at the end she wou'd reward my Love  You were very patient reply'd another when not long since you attempted to ravish her and no doubt had don't if the Person who has paid his Life for his Presumption had not prevented it 'Tis true reply'd the Barbarian the first Fire of my Passion I own was the Flame of Lust but I now begin to fansy if I cou'd gain her Heart I shou'd revel in Bliss for a whole Year at least without being cloy'd But how tedious do the Moments pass continu'd the Villain Oh how I long for Night How will the trembling Slut be bit when instead of flying to the Man she loves she'll find herself in the Embraces of one she detests This Wood will once more be the Bawd to my Designs As soon as ever we have left the Shore I'll proceed to the Enjoyment of the scornful Dame  I must own this Declaration made me shudder and I had once resolv'd to draw my  Pistols and shoot the Villain thro' the Head if the Consideration of our Project had not hinder'd me I waited with as much Impatience as my Rival did till the Moment came of our Decampment As soon as they were mounted I took Horse and follow'd but my Horse hearing other Horses before him neigh'd several times which caus'd my Leaders to stop however as there was but two and I in my Disguise I resolv'd to push on and come up with 'em As I came even with the Wretch and his Companion they ask'd me where I was going I told 'em to such an Inn naming the Place where they were bound This Fellow said the Ruffian may hinder our Design therefore we must prevent him tho' this was spoke in a Whisper yet I heard it plain and began to repent of my Forwardness in following them I therefore put Spurs to my Horse to get out of their Reach  Hold hold cry'd the Master not so fast I want to speak with you I have a Job for you to do which I'll pay you well for 'tis only to go to the Harbour which is not above three Miles off and inquire for the  Speedwell Galley  that lies moor'd to the Wharf bid 'em immediately unmoor and  prepare for Sailing and send the Boat ashore to wait my Coming which won't be above two Hours if thou wilt do this there's a Crown and if you'll wait till I come I'll give thee another Thank you Master said I with all my Heart if your Worship will bespeak a Bed for me at the Inn as you pass by Ay that I will reply'd the Wretch and a good Supper beside I gave him Thanks turn'd my Horse's Head to go back again and resolv'd to do as he desired for then I shou'd see the End of our Project  When I came to the Harbour I found the Boat's Crew ashore waiting for their Master When I had executed my Commission the Coxen cry'd What is the Devil in my Master Does he think my Memory so short that I shou'd forget his Orders in five Hours I fansy so said I for he paid me well for my Journey and yet but in part for I am to stay till he returns for the rest of my Reward I think the open Air is a little too cold to stay in't three or four Hours together therefore if you'll go with me to an Alehouse I'll spend part of my Wages upon you A few Words struck up the Bargain and away we went  When the Company were pretty well warm'd with their Liquor I began to ask 'em a few Questions concerning their Master intimating that we had been in Treaty about my entring into his Service Why reply'd the Coxen you had better  stand still and walk Horses  as the Saying is I own he's good at Promising but the worst at Performing I believe in the whole Dominions of  Great Britain  How comes it to pass then said I that you'll serve such a scurvy Master Why you know Master reply'd the Coxen we Sailors are very blunt honest Fellows therefore as I believe it is not in your Power to hurt me I'll tell you the Truth We are all marry'd or have Settlements upon his Plantations in the  WestIndies  therefore 'tis our Interests and as he brought us out with him we must wink at his Rogueries that he may carry us to our own Plantations again otherwise I'd leave him this Instant for I dare swear he's upon some ill Design this Moment In return to your Confidence of me I reply'd I can assure you 'tis so nay and such an Action that not only may endanger his Life but the Lives of those that assist him in't Upon this all the Company began to look upon one another with Countenances  full of Fear 'Sblood if I thought that cry'd one the Devil might assist him for me Some baudy Business cry'd another I suppose I don't care to hazard my Life for any Whore but my own I'd venture my Life said another in an Engagement in hopes of Plunder but I'll see him d'd before I'll have any thing to do with his dirty Work  In short every Sailor had something to say upon the Occasion and I found by their Sentiments they were all honest Fellows or seem'd so and the more they drank the more they seem'd resolv'd to oppose him in any ill Design I let 'em into some part of the Story in order that they shou'd stand the poor Wretch's Friend that by Mistake might be brought among 'em for I did not doubt but when he found out the Trick that was put upon him his Brutality and Disappointment wou'd push him on to murder the Woman This was the only Motive that induc'd me to enter into Conversation with 'em therefore I intended to take my Leave but was prevented by a loud Knocking at the Door Immediately after enter'd the Wretch swearing abominably at the Coxen and Sailors in not being at the Boat to wait his Coming  The Sailors began to grumble and told him they were not his Slaves nor wou'd be us'd as such I don't know where this Dispute wou'd have ended if the three Fellows that were hired to murder me had not follow'd their Master and desir'd to speak with him in private What is it you want with me you troublesome Vermin cry'd the Brute You know what we want reply'd one of them and therefore we expect to be satisfy'd before you go on Board You know very well we were to have the Reward when our Business was finish'd and not keeping your Word with us makes us imagine you intend to forget the rest of the Money if we don't put you in mind of it You Villains cry'd out their Master if you mention one Word more of that Affair look to yourselves you know you goodfornothing Rascals that it is in my Power to hang you all therefore no more Words or an Halter shall be your Reward you have been too well paid already A Halter our Reward cry'd the Fellow and what shou'd be his Reward that put us upon such an Action Why you Caitiffs you know very well cry'd their Master I only order'd you to Bastinado the Rascal not to murder him And you Clods  if I had Time to stay I wou'd find out Means to help you to the Gallows Come Rogues said he to the Sailors and fly to the Boat this Instant Better Words cry'd the Sailors or you shall to Sea by your self▪ Zounds we know you can't do without us and therefore we'll be better treated and tho' most of your Governors of Plantations are bad enough yet there's one gone to take your Place that we may expect Justice from without paying for't What the Devil I suppose there's a Conspiracy in my Absence reply'd the  quondam  Governor Who has put Rebellion into your Heads not you my honest Friend I hope speaking to me The three Fellows not observing me before seem'd very much surpriz'd at the Sight of me and one of 'em cry'd out in a Transport Good God Mr  Clermont  what brought you here Ha  Clermont  said the Wretch is the Villain then living still I own I was very much surpris'd at this Discovery but was brought out of it by his furious Approach with his drawn Hanger in his Hand however I had Presence of Mind to pull my Pistols out of my Pocket and aim'd one at his Breast telling him if he offer'd to come one Step forwarder I'd shoot him dead at my Feet  The Sight of my Pistols made him stop short and call to his Men to seize me some of 'em not thinking what they did were going to obey his Orders Gentlemen said I hear me two Words and I'll deliver my self into your Hands Upon saying this they stopt and I inform'd 'em in short of their Master's implacable Hatred to me When they had heard my Story they one and all cry'd out they wou'd stand by me with their Lives Upon this he sullenly sat down and was some time before he open'd his Mouth A general Silence follow'd but our Eyes were busy looking at each other At last he open'd in this manner Sir can you forgive me for my past black Designs against your Life I own this Contrition at this Exigence looks like Falshood but upon the Word of a Man of Honour I repent from the Bottom of my Heart of all my base Actions when I look back on 'em it is with Horror How amiable a Figure do you make cloath'd in Innocence and Virtue And how like a Fiend of Hell do I look cover'd with such hateful Crimes but Repentance I hope may wash my Stains away and I shall think I am in the first Road to Virtue if you'll vouchsafe me your Pardon  and Friendship My Servants that I find have sav'd your innocent Life shall receive the Reward they expected for the Humanity that their Master wanted My Seamen shall find me for the future such a Commander as they can wish for and when we arrive in our own Country their Reward  shall exceed their Expectation  Very well reply'd the Coxen half drunk I have heard your Worship talk at this rate before now Ay ay cry'd another we know his Tongue is well hung he promises as well as e'er a Gentleman in the Universe and performs as ill I must confess said the intended Ravisher the Character my own Servants give me is enough to startle a Stranger But what other Motive but Repentance can make me declare myself in this manner I find myself a new Man and only wonder at my former Self All the while this Dispute lasted I was inly ruminating how I shou'd proceed I was in very great doubt of his Sincerity for I observ'd in all his Discourse he turn'd his Eye very often upon the Door as if he expected some of his Men from the Ship to take his Part at least I thought so Beside I wanted very much to confer with my Landlord who I knew  wou'd accompany his Wife tho' unknown to her therefore I told him I would go out to recompose my Spirits and return immediately again Very well he reply'd you are at your own Liberty and it will be my utmost Wish that when you come back you will forgive one that will ever think it his highest Happiness to be esteem'd your Friend I made him no Reply but went out and found my Landlord who was waiting at the Door with four or five more all in Disguise and mask'd attending his good Wife who seem'd very impatient I told him what had happen'd and ask'd him Advice how I should behave myself Damn him he reply'd don't trust him for if you do he'll certainly deceive you But however conceal yourself somewhere about the House till I go in and feel his Pulse for I must get rid of Madam some how  I consented to his going in for I concluded it was the only way to try his Sincerity for if he really repented he would restore his pretended Lady to her Liberty Therefore I retired to wait the Event However upon second Thoughts I judg'd it the safest Course to get my Horse ready for fear of things Just as I was leading him out of the Stable  I perceiv'd my Landlord and the Gentleman coming towards me and I must confess did not know what to think of it but they stopt as soon as they were got out of hearing of the People about the Door Why it is a terrible Business I own said my Landlord to be disappointed in your Revenge for I'll engage he's two Miles off by this time for he mounted immediately and flew away like Lightning Damn him reply'd my false Penitent I wish his Horse may break his Neck Not impossible cry'd my Landlord But since he's gone let's proceed to Business Your Men you may depend on't will soon return to their Duty now Mr  Clermont  has left 'em Therefore give me my Reward and I wish you Luck and a boon Voyage There it is putting a Purse in his Hand all in Gold I hope your Worship reply'd my Landlord has not put a Trick upon me No on my Word return'd the Villain you are the only one I intend not to deceive and if you'll send me Word you have murder'd  Clermont  I'll send thee the next Return after it a hundred Hogsheads of the best Sugar in my Plantations My Thoughts were very much confus'd before but in hearing this I forgot all Patience▪ I drew a Pistol from my  Pocket and running up cry'd No Villain Heaven has reserv'd me to punish such a mortal Devil as thou art I discharg'd my Pistol at his Head and seeing him fall mounted my Horse and flew away like Lightning in earnest I rid six or seven Miles before my troubled Thoughts return'd to Reason and then when I began to think I condemn'd myself for being so rash and thought of the Crime I had committed in killing a Wretch with all his Sins about him  I did not go home that Night neither should I have thought of reposing myself if my Horse had not put me in mind of it by seeming jaded but being far from any House I drove him into a Meadow and sat under a Hedge till Break of Day When I got home my good Uncle saw visibly the Discontent was increas'd in my Countenance but I wou'd not wound his Peace farther by telling him what had befallen me I only feign'd some slight Indisposition therefore staid at home three or four Days but under terrible Inquietudes and what increas'd my Apprehensions I heard nothing from my Mistress for several Days beyond the usual Time The only Consolation was that no Intelligence came concerning  the Death of the Wretch I suppos'd I had kill'd for I was well assur'd if I had been call'd to an Account for it the fatal Inquiry wou'd have broke the Heart of my pious Uncle  I was almost afraid to go to my Landlord's as I call'd him tho' I had no Reason to doubt his Honesty and wonder'd I had not seen him in so many Days Therefore after many Irresolutions I ventur'd to visit him in my Disguise as usual When I came to his House they told me he was ill of a Fever I ask'd a Countryman that was drinking at the Door concerning him I don't know says the Countryman the Man's a Fool I think he takes it much in Dudgeon that his Wife has made him a Cuckold and you know Sir it's many an honest Man's Fortune Now I think he has Reason to be out of his Wits with Joy that he has got rid of a devilish Wife By this Fellow's Discourse I understood every thing had succeeded to his Wish but I trembled to think in what manner I fear'd he might have murder'd her to break his Marriage Bonds and was very uneasy to know the Truth While the Fellow and I were talking a MaidServant came to me and ask'd me if I was not the Person  that brought a Letter to her Master some time ago I was something surpris'd at the Question and did not readily give her an Answer If you are the same Person said she perceiving I said nothing you need not be afraid my Master only order'd me to bring you up Stairs if you should come here at any time I follow'd her to her Master's Chamber without opening my Lips I found him on his Bed and seemingly very weak When the Door was shut he arose  Well Sir said he my Ends are accomplish'd tho' in such a manner that has given me very great Uneasiness for notwithstanding I had all the Reason in the World to despise my Wife yet her deplorable End tho' it shews the Judgment of the Almighty upon wicked Persons has cast me into such a dreadful Melancholy that I believe I shall never shake it off When you Sir fired your Pistol at the base Villain that deserves the worst of Deaths the Report frighted the Horse my Wife rode on to such a Degree that he ran away with her and plunging into the Sea threw her off We try'd all Means to save her but she sunk to the Bottom and we never more saw her It was suppos'd the Tide of Ebb carry'd her into the main Ocean  Well but Landlord said I how did you proceed with the Men after the Villain was kill'd Alas Sir reply'd my Landlord you was not so lucky to make an end of him for one of the Balls only graz'd upon the Top of his Forehead and it is not improbable but the other might wound the Horse my Wife rode on which made him so outrageous  When the Wretch got up again and found the Smallness of his Hurt he was for pursuing you but was prevented by the unfortunate Accident of my Wife He mourn'd very much the Loss of his Mistress as he thought and I own it was some good Luck to me that she was not discover'd to be otherwise for he is of such an implacable Temper I don't know how far his Revenge might have carry'd him for after we had try'd in vain to find out the unfortunate Wretch he was still upon a Project of making an end of you but I wrought him into such a Belief that I wou'd certainly do it for him that he gave me Twenty Guineas for the Job as he call'd it His Men indeed grumbled much but the three Servants that were hired to murder you would not be prevail'd upon to go on Board till he  had satisfy'd 'em according to his Promise He made many Excuses telling 'em he had not Money enough about him at last he gave 'em Twenty Guineas apiece and assur'd 'em he would give 'em the rest when he had them on Board But notwithstanding his fair Promises when their Horses were embark'd and every thing ready to go off with the Boat the three Men were no where to be found They search'd in vain for some time and were oblig'd to set Sail without them I suppose his Uneasiness was for fear they shou'd discover his damnable Intrigues  As soon as the Ship was out of Harbour I got upon my Horse and came home but was very much surpris'd to find the Horse that run away with my Wife into the Sea and suppos'd to be drown'd at home before me All this is what I wanted to declare to you and wou'd have waited on you but my Melancholy and Indisposition prevented me  I told him he ought to consider that a bad Wife was a good thing to get rid of and tho' I was as much concern'd for the Manner of it as he cou'd be yet it was very probable when the Villain had found out the  Trick that was put upon him but his Brutality would have drove him to give her the same Death or an Usage worse than Death I own it reply'd my Landlord and since it seems to be the Hand of Heaven I ought to be satisfy'd but even what I have gain'd by it seems at present to give me very little Contentment and I should have been willing to have forgiven her if I thought she could have return'd to her Duty but I hope Time will wipe off this Score of Melancholy However if I can be of any Service to you in your Amour you may freely command me  I was very much rejoic'd at this kind Offer and told him it was the only thing he could oblige me in since I knew he had the Liberty of going to the House of my Mistress unsuspected I therefore freely declar'd to him the whole Progress of my Love and the Uneasiness I was in for not hearing from my Fair One Well said he notwithstanding my Weakness if you'll give me a Letter of Credence I'll promise you an Answer tomorrow and I shall think I am doing a good Work in endeavouring to join two Bodies whose Souls are united in Heaven I was in such a Transport at his Manner of Speaking that I embrac'd him with the Ardour  of a sincere Friend as indeed he always prov'd himself such a one to me and I think sincerely in such lowborn Souls such Honesty is almost a Miracle I sat my self down immediately to write to my dear  Eliza    IF you would know the Torment I endure in not seeing or bearing from you think a Person on the Rack with his Torturers inflicting every Torment that mortal Life can bear and that is but a faint Idea of what I suffer The Bearer of this I am not asham'd of calling Friend notwithstanding the Disparity of our Conditions Ease my tormented Soul with a Line from that Hand which only can relieve the Pain I undergo I have something to relate to my dear  Eliza  of what has befallen me since I last saw those lovely Eyes that is something surprising Do not thou keep me upon the Rack of Despair any longer but contrive with the Bearer to give me a Meeting once more if you wou'd save the Life of  Yours eternally CLERMONT  When I had finish'd my Epistle I read it to my Landlord who said so many things above his Station that I was surpris'd at his manner of expressing himself He took my Letter and assur'd me he would bring me some Answer if he ventur'd his Life for it I took my Leave of him and resolv'd to return the next Day in hope of a favourable Answer When I offer'd to reward him for the Trouble he was undertaking he absolutely refus'd it and was almost angry with me for proposing any such thing No said he be assur'd I am no mercenary Messenger and tho' I have transacted an Affair with that Wretch that looks like Guilt I will never while I live harbour a mean Thought but hope to convince you that a Person without Birth or Education can pursue Virtue as well as those who have that Advantage of us  I return'd the next Day before Noon but my Landlord was not come back the Disappointment gave me the utmost Uneasiness At last he came and gave me a Letter which I knew by the Superscription came from my adorable  Eliza  tho' wrote with a Pencil the Contents were short as follows  My dear CLERMONT  I am and ever will be your  ELIZA  My dear Friend said I to my Landlord I am infinitely oblig'd to you for the Pains you have taken but am surpris'd though pleas'd at the Shortness of her Answer Sir said my Landlord I have a wonderful Story to relate to you and I doubt not but 'twill surprize you as it did me But first read that Letter which I receiv'd just now from one of the Servants that was hir'd to murder you  Mr CHEESEMAN  I  WOU'D have you be on your Guard Meeting the Coxen of my  quondam  Master's Ship I own I was much surpris'd to find him in  England  whom I thought many Leagues off he inform'd me that going out of the Harbour the Morning that our Hurlyburly happen'd the Tide being ebb'd more than they imagin'd they struck upon a SandBank where they were oblig'd to wait for the next Tide of Flood to carry her off during that Time the Corpse of the Woman whose Horse  carry'd her into the Sea was found which being taken up prov'd to be your Wife and by several Letters in her Pocket it was suppos'd that you with the Confederacy of Mr  Clermont  had contriv'd to impose upon my Master be it which way he will he fansies so and has vow'd bloody Revenge upon you both therefore I send you this by the Desire of the Coxen that you may provide against one whom no Law has Fetters strong enough to bind from doing Crimes too bad to name Take the Advice of  Your Humble Servant RICHARD CROSS  The Reading of this Letter I must own very much alarm'd me Now said my Landlord I will relate the History of my Journey When I came to  Eliza  's Father's House whose Servant I was and whose Tenant I am I went with the Pretence of paying him his Rent tho' not due this Week but guess my Surprize when as soon as I enter'd I saw that execrable Villain the Captain walking in the Garden with my old Master I knew it was not my Business to be seen by him tho' I was then ignorant of  the Affair related in the Letter from Mr  Cross  therefore watching them till they came into the House I went into the Garden a back Way to consider as well as my troubled Thoughts would let me what I should do The Respect I had for you prevented my Returning without delivering your Letter tho' I knew I staid in the Mouth of Danger While I was beating my Brains to no Purpose I saw my young Mistress  Eliza  come into the Garden overwhelm'd with Sorrow I took my Opportunity to speak with her and gave her your Letter which she receiv'd with the utmost Joy  She inform'd me that the Wretch the Captain had been there three Days and her Father was so much rejoic'd to find him alive that by report was thought dead that he resolv'd to force her to be his Wife in a few Days but she bid me assure you she would sooner lay violent Hands upon herself than ever consent to give her Hand to such a Monster of Mankind We had not time for much Conversation for that Moment her Father sent for her in she only took the Opportunity of writing with my Pencil upon the blank Leaf of your Letter that Line I brought you Immediately after I saw 'em  all three come into the Garden so thought it high time to make the best of my way  During this short Relation my Mind felt  he utmost Inquietudes all the Passions incident to Human Nature took their turns within my Breast but at length Revenge got the better and I came to a firm Resolution of making a sure End of that barbarous Wretch the Cause of all my Misfortunes I communicated my Thoughts to my Land  ord who very strongly dissuaded me from  t but to no purpose When he found his Reasons had no Force upon me he offer'd me his Assistance We were some time before we cou'd form a proper Method to accomplish my Design but at length we fix'd upon sending him the following Letter  SIR  I  AM inform'd for certain that your Coxen with the rest of your Men have resolv'd to run away with your Ship and I am assur'd nothing but your speedy Appearance can prevent  em every Person but myself is in the Conspiracy and I am seemingly so that I might have this Opportunity of letting you know their Villainy No matter for my Name but you shall know me when you see me by my wearing an  old goldlac'd Hat which no one on Board has but myself I would have you come alone for I'll take care to prevent their Design till I see you if you are expeditious for I have a secure Method with your Assistance only to put an end to their farther Villainy without Danger Therefore pray Sir communicate this Affair to no one Person till I see you  Your obedient Servant  c  This Letter we convey'd to him the same Evening and follow'd the Messenger as imagining he might take Horse immediately I let my Landlord into my manner of Proceeding and order'd him to retire as soon as he shou'd see the Wretch appear with an Injunction on him if I shou'd be kill'd to bury me as privately as possible and let my Uncle have a Letter I had wrote to him wherein I had inform'd him of every thing that happen'd to the present Moment  Our Letter had the desired Effect for at the Dusk of the Evening my Landlord acquainted me the Groom was getting his Horse ready and he found he intended to go alone according to the Purport of the Letter Therefore full of the Spirit of Revenge I rid on about two Miles before  where I waited for him upon an open Common that lay in his way I never gave myself Time to think all this while what might be the Consequence of such an Action In a Quarter of an Hour I saw him enter the Common I rid up to him and bid him stop At my manner of Proceeding he took me for a Highwayman for he told me very calmly he had nothing about him worth my venturing my Life for No Wretch said I I come for thy Blood who has often endeavour'd to spill that of the unhappy  Clerimont Clerimont  cry'd he in a Transport the only Man I wish'd to have met with and tho' I have an Affair of Consequence upon my Hands yet I will stay to put an end to thy detestable Life I had no time to ask him what Arms he carry'd not intending to take any Advantage of him for as soon as he had done speaking he fir'd a Pistol at me it was so well aim'd that I heard the Balls whistle thro' my Hair I was not long behind him but return'd him one in Exchange that shot his Horse stone dead the sudden Fall of his Horse prevented his getting clear of the Beast therefore I alighted from mine and disengag'd him from him Tho' such impious Villains deserve no Humanity  said I yet I can never forget I am a Gentleman He made me no Reply but drawing his Hanger ran furiously upon me aiming a Blow at my Head that would have ended all my Misfortunes if I had not receiv'd it on my left Arm I found the Stroke had wounded me very much therefore before he cou'd redouble his Blow I shot him thro' the Head he gave a Groan fell down and expir'd  I had then lost all my Resentment and ran to help him up but I found the Top of his Skull shot away and his Brains upon the Ground for tho' it was Night the Moon was up and I cou'd not help standing in a fixt Posture to view the horrid Act as it was then represented to my Fancy my Hand had done But my friendly Landlord rous'd me from my Thoughts that I might take care of my Safety for he told me he heard the Galloping of Horses in the Lane that led to the Common the way we came therefore we mounted our Horses and rid away he leading a full Speed and I following not know  g well what I was doing so full of Trou  re my Thoughts After my Wound  I went home and conceal'd no  Uncle who was under terrible  Apprehensions We learnt afterwards the Horses we heard were the Father of my Mistress and several Servants who follow'd the unfortunate Wretch as imagining some extraordinary Business by the Change of his Countenance when he read the Letter I sent him They took up the Body and bury'd him privately in the Chapel that very Night Searching him they found the Letter that was the Cause of his sudden Departure and tho' I had disguis'd my Hand yet my dear  Eliza  guess'd the Letter came from me and that Imagination gave her insupportable Uneasiness  The next Day her Father with all his Servants rid to the Port to examine concerning the Affair and  Eliza  knowing they could not return till the next Day sent to my Landlord to be inform'd concerning the Tragical Affair Before he went to her he sent to give me Notice where he was going tho' a dreadful Melancholy had seiz'd me and the Pain of my Wound was troublesome I immediately put on my Disguise and follow'd him to  Eliza  's I met him returning but prevail'd on him to go back with me and if possible to procure me a Meeting with my dear Mistress He comply'd with my  Request and my Landlord having related every Circumstance of my Affairs before I receiv'd this Consolation from my Mistress that she cou'd but barely blame me for my Conduct in the Danger I expos'd my self to  We parted with mutual Vows of Constancy but with sad Presages of what befel us afterwards  It was about this time your noble Uncle fixt his Eyes upon me for your Tutor tho' I must own I had no Inclinations that way for I was yet fed with Hope Fortune would still befriend me in my Love  A full Month past on without hearing any thing from my dear  Eliza  My Landlord was forbid ever entering the Doors of her cruel Father and no Reason given for such Treatment tho' it was not hard to guess We understood  Eliza  was under the strictest Confinement I was almost distracted with this cruel Proceeding but had no other Remedy than Patience  One Day as I was walking in our Courtyard ruminating on my sad State a Footman brought me a Letter the Superscription I soon knew to be my dear  Eliza  's he told me it requir'd no Answer and disappear'd in  a Moment I broke open the Seal with trembling Fingers and to my Astonishment found what follows  SIR  I  SEND you This to tell you that Fortune will have us intire Strangers to each other therefore it is my only Request to you that I may never see you more  ELIZA  I will omit to tell you the many different Passions I felt at the Perusal of this cruel Epistle but I fixt a Resolution to see the Ingrateful if it cost me my Life for before her Eyes I intended to put an end to it if I cou'd ever get a Sight of her  Near her House the  Severn  stream'd along which you well know enrich'd the neighbouring Towns with her WaterCarriage I put myself in the Habit of a Bargeman and addressing myself to  Eliza  's Father's Gardener told him if he pleas'd to allow me my Provision I would work with him till the Return of the Boat I belong'd to which is a thing very common in that Country the Bargemen going to work at any Farming Affair till their Boat is tow'd up with Horses  where there is a Tract for 'em when there is no Tract Men supply their Places I was admitted and the second Day saw  Eliza  and made myself known to her tho' I had not the Opportunity of speaking to her She was confin'd in a Room two Pair of Stairs next the Garden I thought by the Signs she made me she was still faithful which I was confirm'd in the next Morning Busying myself as near to her as I cou'd she threw a Handkerchief down which I took up unperceiv'd by any one in it was the following Letter  My dear CLERIMONT  THE Letter you receiv'd my cruel Father dictated and forc'd me with Threats of severest Vengeance on you to write Be assur'd my Heart shall be ever yours and if I cannot reward your faithful Passion I will resign my self into the Arms of Death to avoid the Embraces of any Person living but those of my dear  Clerimont  My Father is making all the Search imaginable after the Murderers as he calls 'em of his Friend therefore be careful of yourself and preserve your Life for her who shall be ever your  ELIZA  P S  I farther beg you will not hazard your self in this manner tho' it is the greatest Joy I can be capable of knowing to see you but I conjure you wou'd depend on my Conduct and trust to Time to cure those Wounds of Absence  This Letter made me shake Hands with Life again which I had almost number'd among my greatest Enemies I immediately left my new Employment and went home to my Uncle's who was ever pressing me to accept of that Office which I now can call my only Consolation I found Means to let my adorable  Eliza  know his Solicitation on that Account who also persuaded me to it giving me her Faith to be ever constant But I believe I shou'd never be prevail'd upon to be so far from the Object of my Love if  Eliza  's Father had not resolv'd to prosecute me for killing that unfortunate Wretch and my Uncle was inform'd he had suborn'd Witnesses to rob me of my Life therefore after settling a Correspondence between my Uncle my Landlord and my lovely  Eliza  I bound my self to your Commands I have receiv'd several Letters from all three which came in your Packets that gave me an Account of the  Welfare of my Mistress among other things letting me know after my Absence she had her full Liberty as before But when you have read this last Letter I hope you will forgive me if Death shou'd release me from that Duty which I paid you to my last Moments  My dear Nephew  MY Hand trembles not thro' Age but Concern when I am forc'd to give you the melancholy Account of the Death of your Mistress  Eliza  Her cruel Father wou'd force her to wed a Person whose Courtship was hateful to her upon your Account to prevent which the Morning of her detested Nuptials she took Poison and expir'd at the Altar My dear Child arm yourself with that divine Weapon Patience and with the Assistance of Heaven combat those dreadful Ills that assail thee Man was born to suffer and I think it no Crime for one of my Cloth to repeat a Line out of a Play tho' upon this sad Occasion  Who wou'd Fardles bear  To groan and sweat under a weary Life  But that the Dread of something after Death  The undiscover'd Country from whose Bourn  No Traveller returns puzzles the Will  And makes us rather bear those Ills we have  Than fly to others that we know not of  But I hope my dear Nephew will bear all with an Angel's Patience which is the hearty Wish of  Your affectionate Uncle  I must own I was very much affected with the Story and the more because it resembled my own Fortune The Reflexion gave me much Uneasiness I sent for him and we mingled our Sighs and Tears together  Now pray Sir said my Tutor think after the Load of Grief which is fix'd upon me whether Death is not the only Friend that can shake it off I strove to comfort him with the little Eloquence I was Master of but bid him have Recourse to his Uncle's last Letter and that wou'd teach him Life was not given us to dispose of as we pleas'd that was a Sin never to be repented of And must I then bear this Load of Life he reply'd perhaps till grey Hairs appear upon my Head No no Sorrow sure will do its Office Let  Friendship  my dear Governor said I supply the Place of  Love  and that from me you may intirely depend on He at last resolv'd  to suffer all he told me purely to oblige me  I now began to be in terrible Anxieties on my own Account for in my last Letters from my Uncle he mention'd nothing of my dear  Isabella  I remember'd with Grief of Mind I had left behind me a very powerful Rival endow'd with Wealth and Title the Pride of the Female Sex but then I thought  Isabella  had none of her Sex's Frailties and I wou'd sooner believe the Legend of the wonderful Images of the  Portugals  than think she cou'd prove false  In the Church of  Bouças  a Village near the City of  Oporto  in the Capital of the Province  Entre Douro e Minho  in  Portugal  is plac'd a Crucifix bigger than the Life averr'd to be wrought by  Nicodemus  It was cast up by the Sea and when it was first found wanted an Arm There were many curious Workmen employ'd to make the Image compleat but as soon as the Arm was fix'd on it immediately flew off again to the Amazement of the Artists In short there were as many Arms made as would have serv'd another  Briareus  or a  Chinese  Idol to no purpose But at last as the good Fathers are truly traditionally inform'd one was found floating on the Sea and being apply'd to the Image stuck so fast without the Assistance of the Statuary that it cou'd not be taken off again and tho' the Body and Arm were found at some Years Distance it prov'd to be the true Arm  At  Santarem  a Town in the Province of  Estremadura  in  Portugal  is another wonderful Image of our blessed Saviour an Infant that has outgrown several Niches made purposely for it and tho' first a Child when erected yet they protest it now is full six Foot high and has almost outgrown the last Nich and if it shou'd proceed in thriving at this Rate it is to be fear'd the Roof of the Church must be remov'd to make room for it  We imbark'd on Board of  one of the King of  Spain  's Gallies for  Genoa  in order to view some Part of  Italy  for I found it impracticable to go by Land as my lovely  Isabella  advis'd me in her Letter But before I left  Spain  I sent my Uncle my Father and Mistress an Account of every thing that befell me and where I was bound next  My poor Governor was still inconsolable tho' he strove to appear chearful in Complaisance to me but I found his Malady had struck him to the Soul and I fear'd Death would lay his Icy Hands upon him yet I had hope Variety of Objects might help him sometimes to forget his Grief And indeed his Fortune having something resembling my own made me doubly suffer with him I had forgot to ask him who the Person was we saw at  Paris  that gave him so much Uneasiness and when it came into my Memory  forbore to ask him for fear I should recall his Sufferings up afresh but when we arriv'd at  Genoa  we found that young Nobleman there where he avoided him as before He then inform'd me it was a distant Relation of his of the  Roman  Persuasion that had often done him ill Offices upon the Account of his being a  Protestant  and farther to make him hate him had begun to make his Addresses to his dear  Eliza  purely in Contradiction to him Upon that Account I resolv'd to make but a short Stay there  The City of  Genoa  no doubt is very ancient Some will have  Janus  the Founder tho' I can't but think the Word  Janua  implies a  Gate  and it was certainly in the Time of the  Romans  one of the Gates to  Italy  It was undoubtedly a City of great Power when  Rome  flourish'd for  Livy  tells me  Liguria Genoa  being its Capital revolted against 'em when  Rome  triumphed over  Africa Asia  and  Greece  their Armies prest the  Romans  to that Degree that they offer'd Vows to  Jupiter Stator  to stop the Progress of the  Ligurians  but at last more by Policy than Force it was made a Province of  Italy    Of all the Countries in the Universe  Genoa  seems the most abandon'd by Nature but certainly the most assisted by Human Industry for notwithstanding the Barrenness of the Situation among high Cliffs and fruitless Mountains one of the proudest Cities of  Europe  raises her aspiring Head There's not one Foot of Earth in their noble Gardens but stands 'em in as much as an Acre in  Wales  This proud City suffer'd much in the Reign of  Lewis  XIV by a hostile Fleet sent to punish the  State  for some Misdemeanors which forc'd them to a disadvantageous Peace The Duke is invested with a Regal Crown at his Inauguration for the Island of  Corsica  being part of their Dominions they give it the Title of a Kingdom  At this City I receiv'd a Packet from  England  brought me by a young Gentleman of the sweetest Countenance I ever saw tho' the Letters he gave me almost distracted me That from my Uncle was as follows  My dear Child  DISPOSE thyself to hear the most uncomfortable News Fortune cou'd prepare for thee Thy dear Father is no more My Tears flow so fast I can hardly write thee the  following Account That pernicious Woman the Complication of all ill Women in one has deceiv'd both thee and me Last Week my dear Brother thy Father sent a Messenger to me desiring me to come to him without Delay I found him almost expiring When I enter'd the Room where he lay the first Object I perceiv'd was the vile Woman's Son  John  stretch'd dead upon the Ground The Sight very much surprising me thy Father faintly call'd me to come near That said he is the first Part of the Punishment due to my cruel Murderess This Morning continu'd your Father that Wretch my Wife sent me my Tea as usual when she wou'd not favour me with her Company and the unfortunate Boy bringing an Excuse from his Mother that she cou'd not Breakfast with me I detain'd him to keep me Company It was not long before the Mother follow'd him and inquired in the utmost Confusion whether he had drank any of the Tea The Boy resolv'd her he had drank two Dishes I found by her extravagant Exclamations there was something extraordinary in the Affair and soon found we were both poison'd In my Rage I drew my Sword and made her partake of the same bitter Cup more than once then lock'd her in that Closet where I have heard no Stirring  these three Hours perhaps the Period of her wicked Life is come for I find my own approaching Dear Brother I have very little to say the rugged Hand of Death has seiz'd me Pray keep this Story secret if 'tis possible and be a Father to my dear Boy He wou'd have said more but the Pangs of Death stop'd his Tongue and his Eyes clos'd for ever The mournful Sight drove me into such a furious Passion that I drew my Sword in order to sacrifice the Author of our Misfortune but when I open'd the ClosetDoor there was not any Body to be found Searching about I perceiv'd some Linnen ty'd to the Foot of your Father's  Escritore  which hung out of the Window going to see how she had made her Escape I perceived her Body lie breathless under the Window upon the Ground with her Brains on a large Stone the only one I believe in the whole Garden The Linnen I find broke about a Foot below the Sash she went out at She has suffer'd by the Hand of Heaven 'tis true but we have lost a Brother and a Father by her Wickedness who impos'd upon our easy Natures Come my dear Son for I now must call you so and comfort me for this irreparable Loss nothing but your Sight can assuage my Grief Come and take Possession of a Fortune that can overbalance  that of  Isabella  's let us mingle our Tears together to moisten the Ashes of your good Father's Grave But grieve not too much my Child for fear you should endanger that Life which is intirely wrapt up in yours I have conceal'd our Misfortunes as much as possible and the Coroner my Friend has brought in the Affair  Accidental Death  and the World is impos'd on in such a manner that they imagine there was not any Design in the melancholy Story The Relation has so much dispirited me that I have hardly Strength to subscribe myself  Thy dear Uncle and Father  c  P S  All thy Brothers are gone to Eternity before thy Father except thy Brother  Jonathan  whom we have not heard any News from these Seven Years and we may reasonably suppose he rests in Peace in the Grave  This Letter put me out of Love with Life and my good Governor gave me that Comfort he had formerly receiv'd from me but had it not been for the Consideration of my Uncle and my divine  Isabella  I believe I should have call'd Death to my Aid The Letter I receiv'd from her gave me some Consolation it was wrote in such a touching  manner for my Loss with the Lamentation of her whole Family and her Dependance on my Life and Love that I resolv'd to live if it was but to thank her for her Tenderness tho' I must own I felt the utmost Concern in the Loss of that consolative Epistle It was three whole Days before I inquired for the young Gentleman that brought me the Packet But what was my Surprize when my Governor brought him to see me and at the same time told me in that young Gentleman I beheld his amiable  Eliza  I forgot all my Sorrows at so unexpected a Rencounter and my Heart overflow'd with an inexpressible Joy on the behalf of my Governor I cou'd hardly believe my Senses What cry'd I dead and reviv'd again I must own reply'd the charming  Eliza  my Story is a little Romantic But the Obligations my Lover has receiv'd from you shall prevail upon me to relate that Part of it which you are a Stranger to and tho' I ought to blush at this Transformation I am sure you will forgive me when you know it proceeds from Love  After our Illfortune had separated us a Gentleman of a great Estate related to  Clerimont  renew'd his fulsome Addresses to me and tho' of a different Religion my Father  gave his cruel Consent and the Day was fixt for our Nuptials By the Advice of a Female Acquaintance I drank a Sleeping Draught which depriv'd me seemingly of all the Faculties of Life When the intended Bridegroom came he was very easy under his Disappointment and said to one of his Servants loud enough to be heard by my Father Pox on't this had been lucky enough  Dick  if she had staid till the Day after our Wedding Very true reply'd the Servant the WeddingSheets and the Shroud are the best Linnen can be put on a Woman And the sooner she changes return'd the Master the better Then with a HorseLaugh without taking any Leave they rid away  My Father was very much incens'd at his brutal Behaviour and as I found afterwards repented his Usage of me He prepared a magnificent Funeral but I spar'd him the Trouble in coming to Life again and I must own never receiv'd any Testimony of his Tenderness before He caress'd me with all the Love expected from a Parent vowing never more to force my Inclination and spoke several favourable things of my dear  Clerimont  But alas the Funeral he had taken such Pains to furnish out for me prov'd  in some fort for himself for two Days after my Revival leaning over a Balcony to give some Directions to the Workmen in the Garden it gave way and he fell never to rise again in this World  The fatal Accident notwithstanding I was a free Woman and Mistress of a plentiful Fortune gave me unspeakable Discontent for by his Behaviour to me I began to revive the Love and Duty which his former Severity had almost kill'd After I had perform'd the Funeral Rites I began to think of my dear  Clerimont  and being inform'd by his good Uncle he had wrote him an Account of my supposed Death took a Resolution of undeceiving him myself therefore embark'd for  Barcelona  in a Ship of my own since my Father's Death as a Passenger unknown to any one after settling my Affairs at home I soon found you out and had the Pleasure of seeing the deep Melancholy growing in the Face of my Lover I embark'd with you for  Genoa  without discovering myself or ever appearing before him but in the Night to observe his Sighs Going to the PostHouse here I found that fatal Packet directed for you and took that Opportunity to wait on you tho' had I understood the Contents  of it I should not so readily have brought it Last Night I reveal'd myself to  Clerimont  for I cou'd no longer bear his Sorrows and today he has brought me to pay you the Thanks suitable to your Goodness but as I have not Words sufficient I beg you would take even my Silence for the Force of Eloquence working in my Mind That shou'd be my Task reply'd my Governor but I am as uncapable as you for I find the Torrent of Joy pour'd so unexpectedly in upon me has made such a Revolution in my Soul that my Body is not able to bear the Transport Therefore dear Sir think your self what a grateful Heart wou'd say and imagine my Thanks  The good Fortune of these happy Lovers was the Balm to the extreme Sorrow I felt I was resolv'd to return for  England  with my Governor and his Mistress in the first Vessel of our Country that was ready but at last it was agreed to travel by Land for the better Conveniency of  Eliza    While we were providing for our Journey a Galley of  Genoa  arriv'd with a Corsair of  Barbary  she had taken after a bloody Resistance There were six and Thirty Slaves redeem'd from a wretched Captivity they had  undergone on Board the Corsair Hearing there was one  Englishman  among 'em I resolv'd to relieve him and carry him home along with me after his hard Sufferings My Governor went according to my Desire and brought him to me At first Sight I was struck with a Tenderness I cou'd not give any Account for but after a little Conference I found it was my Brother  Jonathan  who had been absent above Eight Years I never consider'd I had met with one that wou'd take some part of my Fortune from me but the Joy I receiv'd in relieving an only Brother from Misery gave me the utmost Satisfaction He gave me his History in the following manner  THE HISTORY OF Mr  JONATHAN VAUGHAN    YOU were so young my dear Brother when I left my Father's House in order to make a Campaign in  Flanders  that I believe you can hardly remember it My Brother  Richard  and I were both Cadets at the Siege of  Namur  and tho' we behav'd our selves perhaps with Courage enough we gain'd nothing more than several dangerous Wounds that confin'd us to our Quarters longer than we desir'd for our glorious Monarch King  William  took that Place held before as impregnable while we had the Mortification of being under the Surgeon's Hands  When we had Strength enough to go to the Field the Campaign was ended and our  Money falling short we cou'd not provide Necessaries to embark for  England  with the King without making Figures below our Birth we wrote to our Father laying before him our Necessities and had  l  paid us by a Banker of  Amsterdam  With this small Pittance we had the disagreeable News of by Father's Second Marriage and a scurvy Hint that Money wou'd not be so ready for the future This put us almost out of our Senses for  l  would not go far with a couple of young Fellows just coming into the World that were oblig'd to live like Gentlemen However to make the best on't we discharg'd our Servants sold our Horses with some part of our unnecessary Equipage and rais'd our Bank to a Hundred Pistoles With this small Stock we embark'd for  Ireland  where we were inform'd our King intended to be at the Head of his Troops early the following Spring for it was strongly reported the Rebels had gather'd together a formidable Army there But meeting an  English  Vessel in the Channel this News was contradicted They gave us an Account of the AssassinationPlot and that every thing was quiet in  Ireland  This put an end to all our Hopes of getting Employment therefore we  intended to Land in  England  and steer our Course homeward but Providence intended otherwise  The fifth Day after we put to Sea we discover'd the  Lizard  and a  French  Privateer at the same time We had but ten Men besides seven Passengers and four Guns therefore made all the Sail we cou'd to avoid 'em but to no purpose we fought 'em briskly for half an Hour but losing three of our Sailors and two of our Passengers among whom our poor Brother  Richard  lost his Life whose Death had almost ended mine we surrendred and were carried Prisoners to  St Malo's  St Malo Maclovipolis Aletha Maclovia  is a SeaPort in the Province of  Bretagne  in  France  It is built upon a small Island join'd to the main Land by a large Bridge Tho' the Town is not large it is wellpeopled strong and rich by Traffic From this Port in time of War with  England  or  Holland  many Privateers are sent to infest the  English  Channel  By good Fortune I had conceal'd the best part of our Money in the Waistband of my Breeches and the Captain seeing my Grief for the Loss of my dear Brother prevented my being search'd restoring me all our little Equipage and us'd me with a tender Friendship When we landed  I was not imprison'd with the rest of our unfortunate Men but was almost compell'd to live with the Captain I freely own'd to him the Money I conceal'd but he would not touch a Penny  I wrote several Letters to my Father wherein I acquainted him with my hard Fortune and the Death of my poor Brother begging him to relieve me from my Misfortunes by paying my Ransom which I had agreed with my Captain for Three Hundred Crowns I cou'd have satisfy'd him with what little Money I had but he refus'd it telling me he wou'd stay till it was sent me by my Friends that he might have more of my Company I receiv'd but one Letter to the many I sent and that gave me Hopes I shou'd have the Money I wrote for by the first Opportunity but I waited in painful Expectation near a Twelvemonth to no purpose and my little Stock was almost spent besides my Cloaths were pretty well wore out and I began to fear I shou'd want common Necessaries  My Captain continu'd very kind to me notwithstanding the Reason he had to the contrary nay offer'd me my Freedom on my bare Word but my Heart wou'd not let  me accept it At last he press'd me to go to Sea with him but I told him Whatever Obligations I had to him I hop'd he wou'd excuse me if I refus'd to fight against my own King and Country I might have enter'd into the Service of a Nobleman but my Spirit wou'd not permit me I must own I had a Longing Desire to signalize myself by the Sword and an Opportunity happen'd some time after that seem'd to favour my Design  The  French  fitted out a Fleet of Ships to bombard  Tunis  Tunis  is a City and SeaPort upon the Coast of  Barbary  govern'd by a  Bey  or  Dey  tho' subservient to the Emperor of  Constantinople  It is large strong and very well Peopled Their chief Riches consist in their Corsairs who generally take all the Vessels of what Nation soever tho' perhaps at Peace It is seated in a Plain near the Lake  Barbasueco  nine Leagues from the Ruins of the ancient  Carthage    under the Command of the Chevalier  Fourbin  a Gentleman well experienc'd in Maritime Affairs I was recommended to the Captain of the  Superbe  by my Friend who receiv'd me very cordially  When we arriv'd at  Tunis  we bombarded it for six Days and almost reduc'd it to Ashes There were several MerchantShips  within the Bar that the Corsairs had taken from several Nations one we were inform'd was richly laden With our Captain's Consent I took fifteen Men well arm'd and in the middle of the Night we row'd into the Harbour under the Mouths of their Cannon cut her Cable and brought her off But the Ship's Sails being taken off the Yards we were oblig'd to tow her away with our LongBoat the whole Bulwarks thunder'd upon us incessantly and at last an unlucky Shot tore to pieces our LongBoat What became of the rest of the Men I know not for never having learnt to swim I soon lost my Senses  By the Beams of the MorningSun I began to open my Eyes and perceiv'd I was cast upon a Ridge of Sand that the Tide of Ebb had left uncover'd under a Rock at the Back of the Town yet out of Sight either of the Ships or Harbour tho' I cou'd hear the  Moors  Voices above me I was very faint and found it difficult to rise but I recover'd some Strength when I had disgorg'd the vast Quantity of SeaWater I had swallow'd By good Fortune I had a small BrandyBottle in my Pocket that was of great Service in reviving my Spirits  I began to walk but to my great Grief found I had above two Miles to go upon the Sand before I cou'd come to an Opening of the Country and to add to my Misfortune the Tide was flowing very fast so that if I did not make haste it wou'd overtake me before I cou'd get away Judge then my Distress if I staid where I was I must have inevitably been drown'd and if I went on I had no Hopes but of being a miserable Slave  I walk'd as fast as I cou'd tho' Heaven knows with a heavy Heart Yet sometimes I thought as I was an  Englishman  it might be of some Advantage to me and therefore form'd a Story in my Mind that I hop'd wou'd prevent my falling into Slavery  When I had got off the Sand I perceiv'd the Country about me was chiefly Gardens but being fatigu'd thro' Heat and Weakness I was oblig'd to sit down under a high Wall of Reeds design'd for a Fence to a Garden behind me Under this Shade my Sorrows and Reflexions brought Sleep upon me whether I wou'd or no for I strove to resist it but was soon I believe awak'd by Dirt and Weeds that were thrown upon me out of the  Garden behind The Surprize made me cry out upon the Instant I heard People call out to me as I suppos'd in the  Moorish  Language tho' I cou'd not understand 'em I got up and walk'd on and immediately was met by four  Moorish  Gardeners as I imagin'd by their Implements I went submissively up to 'em tho' I perceiv'd they were in some Consternation by their Faces We talk'd together tho' we could not understand one another At last one of 'em went from the rest and return'd in a few Minutes with two more one of 'em seem'd to be their Master by his Habit and the other was a  Spanish  Slave I understood enough of that Language by the help of my  Latin  to let him into the Knowledge of my being an  Englishman  When their Master found that an  English  Youth about thirteen or fourteen Years of Age was sent for This Boy as I was inform'd afterwards was taken in an  English  Vessel when he was about nine Years of Age going to  Maryland  with his Parents who both dy'd with Grief at their Misfortune and the Lad was prevail'd upon to turn  Mahometan  I told him I was an  Englishman  taken Prisoner by the  French  and made my Escape from 'em in the Night in one of their Boats alone  but being unacquainted with the Coast was thrown upon the SandBank The  Moor  order'd me to be ask'd if I understood the  Mathematicks  or  Navigation  or whether I had any Friends at  Tunis  I reply'd as to the  Mathematicks  I had no Knowledge of them as being design'd for the LandService But I hop'd every  Englishman  wou'd be a Friend to their wretched Countryman in Distress I added I did intend to apply to the Consul at  Tunis  But the  Moor  inform'd me the  English  Consul and most of their Merchants had abandon'd the City on account of its being bombarded by the  French    In short I found by all his Discourse he intended me for one of his Slaves It wou'd avail me nothing to reason with him therefore I was forc'd through a fatal Necessity to accept of my Chains as chearfully as I could I was taken into the House through the Garden with some seeming Civility and had a comfortable Supper if my Sorrows had not spoil'd my Stomach tho' I eat and slept alone upon a Bed made of Rice Straw But alas Reflexion brought ten thousand Daggers to my Heart and Rest was almost a Stranger for many Days  My Master never troubled himself about the Siege Yet I had the Curiosity to inquire of the  English  Lad how things went and had some Pleasure to hear that the Ship we got out of the Mole was safe in the  French  Fleet  My chief Business at first was to look after three  Arabian  Horses that belong'd to my Master and I happen'd to do my Business so well that he gave me some Encouragement and his Son about Seventeen would be never out of my Company  In three Months Time I made a very good Progress in the  Moorish  Tongue I could make shift to talk with my Master in his own Language I begg'd the Favour of him to let me see the City of  Tunis  but he would not let me stir out of his House The  French  Fleet did not stay long after my unfortunate Accident but I learnt by the Boy they had reduc'd the City almost to Ruins The Reason of my Master's not permitting me to go into  Tunis  was as I suppos'd for fear I should meet with some Merchants that might procure me my Freedom  Understanding I could play a little on the Flute he procur'd me several very good ones with which I had the Misfortune to please him  more than I desired But alas What is Musick to a Wretch that every Moment long'd for Liberty or with what Fancy could I touch the Instrument when my Thoughts were ever fixt upon my hard Fate However I was the more esteem'd by him and I must confess if all their Slaves were us'd as I was they could have nothing to trouble them but their want of Liberty But Liberty's the Salt of Life and nothing can relish without it or supply its Place  My Master liv'd a luxurious idle Life as all the  Moors  do that have not Employments All his Time was spent in Eating Drinking Praying Sleeping performing the Ablution  The Ablution is a Washing which the  Turks  and  Moors  perform after they think themselves polluted by the Conversation of Women Sleeping doing the Effects of Nature touching a Christian or a Drop of Wine spilt on their Garments nay some are so superstitious never more to wear those Garments  or visiting his Wives They were five in Number but I can't describe their Beauty never having an Opportunity to see their Faces but their Shape and Air seem'd very inviting I often saw some of 'em at a distance in the Garden with their Faces veil'd for none of the Slaves are allow'd to speak to  them or even to come near enough to do it would be an unpardonable Crime  I began now to think all Hopes of seeing my own Country were over with me for I cou'd not find the Means of sending a Letter to my Father in  England  All the Consolation I had in my Misery was that my Master never importun'd me on the Account of my Religion I spent four Years in my terrible Servitude for I always thought it so notwithstanding my favourable Usage In the beginning of the fifth Year of my wretched Slavery my Master dy'd and his Son took Possession of his Father's Fortune I began now to feel the Hopes of Freedom revive in my Soul again for the young  Moor  seem'd to have some Friendship for me But alas I found to my terrible Consternation he was possess'd with the most hateful Passion Man can be guilty of He soon alter'd his Usage of me when I let him know I would rather suffer Death than comply with his infamous Desires I can hardly mention it without Blushing His ill Treatment upon that Account plung'd me into Despair for to be reveng'd on me he not only put me upon the most servile Offices but I often suffer'd the  Bastinado  The  Bastinado  is a Number of Blows with a thick Cudgel on the Soles of the Feet which sometimes makes the Sufferer incapable of walking many Days The  Moors  not only punish Slaves that way but  Mahometans  also when they are guilty of Theft and not able to return what they stole  I believe if I could have procur'd any Weapons I should have cut him in pieces and put an end to my own Anguish by a voluntary Death  The young  English Mahometan  often gave me some Consolation by mingling Tears with me but alas that Tenderness was all he could give me and that very secretly My Miseries increas'd upon me and I begg'd the Youth to procure me a Dose of  Opium  that I might sink into an eternal Sleep and lose my Life and Misery together but I could not prevail upon him  My new Beast of a Master about a Month after the Death of his Father was oblig'd to take a Journey to look after the Estate that was left him I knew not how far he was to go but I was inform'd his Affairs would keep him in the Country Forty Days at least so I resolv'd in that Time to make some Attempts to escape tho' I lost my Life  When he was gone I had little Business to do and was well us'd for even the  Moorish  Servants were concern'd for my barbarous Treatment When they had an Opportunity they would come to hear me play on the Flute and always bring something to make merry with  One Evening an old Woman came to me before the rest of the Servants and gave me a Letter which I open'd and to my Surprize found the following Words in  English  SIR  THO' I write to you in  English  I am a  Moor  by Birth and Daughter to the illustrious  Fontimama  that was the Name of my old Patron While he was alive I was contented with my Condition but since the Angel of Death has taken him from me my Brother grows most insupportably tyrannous In short I have heard your Story and pity'd you before I was capable of Love but now I have seen you tho' in Disguise last Night unknown to you or any one but the Bearer of this I must confess myself absolutely yours if we can join our Hands in the holy Bands of Wedlock  I know you'll be surpriz'd when I tell you tho' all my Friends are Followers of  Mahomet  yet I am a sincere Christian in my Heart without Baptism and my manner of being one I shall let you know  Mustapha  the Name of the  English  Youth that lives in our House taught me to speak your Language before I was seven Years old by the Command of my late Father as also to write your way  The  Turks  and  Moors  write from the right Hand to the left  When I had learnt all that  Mustapha  cou'd teach me my Father procur'd me many Books in the  English  Tongue I read the mall some I translated into  Morisco  to divert my Father among them were several Books of your  Holy Law  though unknown to any one which I perus'd at first out of Curiosity only but found so much sound Truth and pure Divinity that I began to abhor the Absurdities of the  Alcoran  and by degrees I hope I am come to a State of Salvation thro' the Blood of your Prophet that suffer'd on the Cross to save his Followers that truly believe in him The sensual Paradise I abhor painted by  Mahomet  only to beguile his voluptuous Adherents  I have found several Stories in your Books of the Forwardness of  Moorish  Women but believe me dear  Englishman  I hope I shall never carry any thing but virtuous Inclinations in my Heart which ever shall be yours  P S  I will take an Opportunity in the Absence of my Brother to converse with you for I would willingly have you owe your Sense of the Obligation to something else than bare Hopes of your Freedom which we will concert when I see you and let your Condition be what it will I hope to bring a Dowry I mean a worldly one that is lawfully my own to keep us above Want Think favourably and  Adieu my Soul  Imagine dear Brother the Pleasure that fill'd my Mind at the Reading of this Letter but I must own they proceeded from the Hopes of my Liberty for Love had never yet laid hold of my Heart  In the Evening when the Servants came about me as usual they were amaz'd to find me so merry I sung several  Moorish  LoveSongs that I had learnt among 'em for their Language is very Poetical and several  English  ones that touch'd upon my own Circumstances which very much delighted 'em In short we spent the Evening in Pleasure and Mirth  I went to rest with a Mind far more at Ease than usual but had not slept long before I was awak'd with a gentle Rapping at my Cell Door When I open'd it I perceiv'd the old Matron that brought me the Letter Come said she in the  Moorish  Language very softly put on your Cloaths and follow me from  Mahomet  's Hell into Paradise I'll be your Conductor tho' a Christian as well as yourself I dress'd myself with a Confusion of Thought I had never felt before I follow'd my Conductress without well knowing what I was about and entred into a lower Room of a SummerHouse at the bottom of the Garden in the Dark where I heard the sweetest Voice I ever heard in my Life the Sound went quite thro' my Soul and set my Body in a Tremble bid the SheSlave make fast the Door said the Lady and light up Tapers She instantly obey'd and shew'd me the most amiable young Creature my Eyes ever beheld I stood like one chang'd into a Statue with Admiration and I was not able to utter a Word for some time I kneel'd down  before her and kiss'd her Sleeve  The Sleeves of the  Turks  and  Moors  hang down very low and by Kneeling and Kissing them is express'd the most profound Submission either to Man or Woman  But she gently rais'd me up with the most obliging Smile imaginable What Sir said she must I against the Custom of your Country declare my Passion for you and not have a single Word in return I reply'd the Sight of such an unexpected Angel might well take all my Faculties away Come said she sit down and partake of a small Repast I have prepar'd for you and chear your Spirits with a Cup of Wine tho' I drink none myself not out of any Respect to the Prophet  Mahomet  but that I never was accustom'd to it I know you  English  Gentlemen make it your common Drink I begg'd to be excus'd from either neither could I indeed for the Sight of her fill'd my Soul with a Profusion of Delight And dear Brother you must love like me before you can guess at the soft thrilling Pleasure that ran thro' my Blood I won't detain you with the tender things we said to each other But sure Novels and Romances can't produce you a Heroe that ever was so much struck at the first Sight of his  adorable Mistress 'twas then I wore the double Chains of Love and Bondage In short we exchang'd our Hearts and gave one another Assurances of eternal Fidelity that can never be shaken on my Part or I believe on hers  I must beg Leave to recover myself from this Tenderness not altogether becoming a Man before I can pursue the Thread of my uncomfortable Story  Several Evenings were past thus delightfully during the Absence of her Brother We had many Schemes to set us at Liberty and at last agreed I should have a Sufficiency from her to pay my Ransom tho' it shou'd amount to ten thousand Crowns and when I had got my Liberty she wou'd find Means to make her Escape to me I must own tho' it was a Proof of the Sincerity of her Love I made many Scruples of receiving Money from her but she assur'd me she wou'd make use of none but her own She had prevail'd on her Father to settle a sufficient Fortune upon her tho' very uncustomary that she might ever live a single Life tho' her only Reason was she never wou'd join in Marriage with one contrary to her own Religion and her Father being infinitely fond of her not knowing  her true Motive gave into her Possession secretly the Value of Twenty Thousand Pounds  English  Money besides several rich Jewels The Thoughts of so much unexpected Happiness gave another Turn to my Looks which I could not hide but I made the Servants and Slaves believe the Absence of my Master occasion'd the Alteration  A  Jew  was pitch'd upon to transact the Affair who are a sort of People in that Country us'd to all manner of Business and of the utmost Secrecy when Money ties up their Tongues This  Jew  was to bargain with my Master for my Freedom as cheap as he cou'd and to have two hundred and fifty Crowns when the Affair was compleated▪ He knew nothing of  Fatima  that is the Name of my divine Mistress for the Bargain was made by the old Woman  One Day when I was pleasing myself with the Thoughts of my coming Happiness my Master arriv'd even twenty Days before he was expected The Moment he came in I was order'd before him Here said he in the  Arabian  Tongue to a  Moor  that was with him is the surly Slave I told you of he's yours now use him like a Dog as he deserves and take him from my Sight this Moment  Upon the Instant I was loaden with Chains and by several Slaves forc'd to follow my new Master I was in such a Surprise that I had not open'd my Mouth till we had got a good distance from the House I then desir'd submissively to speak to him I inform'd him there was Money come from my Friends and now in the Hands of  Ben Addi  the  Jew  to pay for my Ransom He told me he would talk with me about it when he came back from his Voyage I was thunderstruck at his Answer and endeavour'd to soften him but in vain for we never stopt till we came on Board a Galley that lay in the Road of  Tunis  and in two Hours afterwards put to Sea  As soon as I came on Board I was chain'd to an Oar and if I did not do as I shou'd do I was taught with many unmerciful Blows I endeavour'd to put an end to my miserable Life with my Irons but was prevented with another Chastisement The Thoughts of my dear  Fatima  made me more outragious and I was resolv'd to starve myself to Death I exclaim'd against Fortune my old Master and my new one in the  Moorish  Language in hope it might provoke the latter to put an end to my Life But instead of that he came  to me desiring I wou'd have Patience telling me I'll treat with you for your Ransom now and I swear by  Mahomet  when I come back and you pay me what I agree with you for you shall that Moment have your Liberty This Promise compos'd me a little for the  Moors  never falsify their Words when they swear by their Prophet I begg'd his Pardon for the Rudeness of my Tongue and promis'd to do my Duty quietly for the future We agreed for Five Hundred Crowns and I proffer'd him Fifty more if he wou'd release me from my hard Labour He told me he cou'd not do that because he should want one to supply my Place He farther added if I cou'd strike up a Bargain with any of the Sailors and do what I could in the Room of the Person that wou'd undertake it he wou'd freely give his Consent but not one of the  Moors  would listen to the Proposal at last the Gunner's Mate agreed with me for Twenty Crowns provided I wou'd reassume my Oar when we came to any Engagement The Bargain being struck my Chains were taken off and I agreed with the Captain my Master who was a  Sicilian  Renagado to eat at his Table for the other Thirty Crowns This wou'd not have been comply'd with had  he been a natural  Moor  for they never eat with the Christians but Renegadoes are not so scrupulous  We were out two Months before we met with any Ship of  Europe  but near the Coast of  Alicant  we encounter'd an  English  MerchantShip that prov'd too hard for us disabling our Galley and killing and wounding above Fifty of our Men so that at last our Captain thought fit to give over the Attempt He resolv'd to go back to  Tunis  to refit But the next Day a violent Storm took us which lasting eight Days we were drove out of our Course and when it abated we found our selves near the Island of  Corsica  Several Renegadoes advis'd the Captain to make a Descent and seize some of the Inhabitants in order to better their Voyage which he comply'd with tho' much to my Sorrow to be so long absent from  Tunis    Turning a Point of Land we discover'd a Galley of  Genoa  preparing in a great Hurry to attack us we endeavour'd to get away but to no Purpose for they came up with us and after a desperate Engagement took us tho' with great Loss on both Sides neither do I believe we had submitted if our Captain had not been kill'd for I think I never saw a  Man behave himself with more Courage and Conduct when he found there was no avoiding the Engagement  Thus my dear Brother I have gain'd my Freedom from the Chains of Bondage And sure never any Prisoner rejoic'd less at his Liberty than I do and if I had not met with you that gives me all the Joy I am capable of feeling without my dear  Fatima  I believe my Sorrows wou'd have made an end of my miserable Life Nay as it is I can never be happy without her We condol'd with my Brother some time at his melancholy Relation and I must confess I felt so much that my Heart prompted me to think of attempting to bring off the Object of his Desires When I communicated my Thoughts to my Brother he was transported We were several Days before we cou'd light upon a Project that seem'd reasonable At last we determin'd to hire a  Tartane  and engage about a Dozen resolute Men who shou'd be all disguis'd in  Moorish  Habits We got a broad flatbottom'd Boat built on purpose something like our FerryBoats in  England  only with higher Sides and not so heavy With these we intended to sail for  Tunis  anchor  as near as we cou'd to the long SandBank behind the Rocks my Brother mention'd where he was thrown out of the LongBoat then with our flatbottom Boat land as near the House of  Fatima  's Brother as we cou'd and bring her away by Force  My Brother and Governor lik'd the Design very well and wou'd make one in it even with the Consent of the fair  Eliza  who was resolv'd her dear  Clerimont  shou'd partake of whatever Fortune befell us nay it was hardly in our Power to prevent her going along with us We hir'd a Vessel and got our Boat ready but we had much Difficulty to get Men some of the Slaves were solicited I mean those that were set at Liberty with my Brother but none wou'd venture near the  Barbary  Coast again willingly At last by great Rewards I pickt out Seven  Englishmen  and Four  Genoese  that promis'd to sacrifice their Lives for us  We embark'd with a favourable Wind and arriv'd in the Latitude of  Tunis  in twelve Days but we did not think it proper to come too near till it was dark When Night appear'd we made for the Shore and anchor'd within half a Mile of the Sand then getting our flatbottom'd Boat out my Brother my  Governor myself and Nine of our Men got into it every one arm'd with two Brace of Pistols a Cutlass and a short Dagger but we were not got above half a Mile from the Ship ere we struck on the Sands tho' we suffer'd no Damage because the Sea was very calm But the Tide flowing our Boat floated again in half an Hour When we came near the Shore we left off Rowing and set her forward with Poles got for that Purpose that we might not be discover'd by the Noise of our Oars We soon landed at the Place my Brother purpos'd two of our Men we left to secure the Boat and keep her even with the Water as the Tide ebb'd away We then set forward led by my Brother When we came near the Place a great Mastiff Dog open'd so loud that he might be heard even to the City of  Tunis  But my Brother being foremost and knowing him call'd him by his Name but the poor Creature's Joy to see him was almost as loud as his Barking  In short the House was alarm'd for we cou'd see Torches waving too and fro in the Garden However we encourag'd one another and went boldly on to the Gate Just as we came to it it flew open and a young  Moor  flew from us like Lightning We did  not care to lose time in pursuing him but press'd in still following my Brother who led us into the very Courtyard The first he met seem'd to be a Person of Distinction by the Richness of his Dress He was follow'd by seven or eight Servants When he came up to my Brother he made a Stop and some Words passing between 'em in the  Moorish  Tongue the  Moor  immediately fir'd a Pistol at him We thought we had no Time to lose but fell upon 'em like so many Furies kill'd two or three of 'em and immediately dispers'd the rest But as we were following my Brother into the House we perceiv'd him faint and fall Speechless upon the Ground While we were examining his Wound a lovely young Creature came running to us all in Disorder crying in  English  If you are Christians protect me I did not doubt but this was the fair  Fatima  by her extraordinary Beauty and speaking  English  therefore order'd my Brother who was shot quite thro' the Thigh to be put in a Wheelbarrow and immediately carry'd to the Boat We had put our Handkerchiefs into the Wound and stopt the Bleeding but he had not recover'd his Senses We immediately follow'd with the amiable Christian  Moor  but were  forc'd to turn about to defend ourselves against the Person that fir'd at my Brother and his Slaves that he had once more rally'd He call'd to us in a prodigious Fury but we understood him not He made a Stroke at my Head with his Scimitar that wou'd have infallibly ended my Days if I had not receiv'd it on the Hilt of my Sabre but I ended his Fury by shooting him dead at my Feet  The Slaves seeing their Master fall ran yelling back again into the Garden I took up his Scimitar and made the best of my way after our People▪ When we came to our Boat we push'd away as fast as ever we cou'd for there was no Time to be lost we cou'd easily perceive the City was alarm'd by the firing of several Guns and the Lights that gleam'd over the Points of the Rocks We imagin'd the young  Turk  that rush'd out of the Garden when we were going in had given Notice to the City which we suppos'd to be the young  English Mahometan  my Brother mention'd in his Relation  One of the Two we left to look after the Boat was a  Genoese  Surgeon who immediately dress'd my Brother's Wound as well as he cou'd in the Dark but he cou'd not assure me whether there was any Danger or no  till he came to have Light enough to examine it more circumspectly  The Confusion we were all in did not permit us to take Notice of a young  Moor  that was in the Boat with us I ask'd the Surgeon and the other  Genoese  that were left to look after the Boat how the Youth came there He told me not long after we landed he walk'd after us to listen if he cou'd hear any thing and perceiving this young Spark coming towards him with a great deal of Precipitation he thought it was his best way to secure him for fear he might alarm the Country I was loth continu'd the Surgeon to fire upon him not knowing but there might be People near us therefore resolv'd to engage him with my Cutlass but as I was going to assault him he fell upon his Knees and spoke in such a beseeching Accent tho' I did not understand a Word of his Discourse that I cou'd not have the Heart to hurt him therefore secur'd him in the Boat and in the Hurlyburly quite forgot him for I think his seeming Innocency and his Tears which have never ceas'd since he has been with us wou'd have prevail'd upon me to have set him at Liberty  I spoke to him in  Lingua Franca  Lingua Franca  is a compound Speech generally understood by the  Moors  on the Sea Coasts as well as those on the Sea Coasts of  Italy France  and  Spain  most Parts of the  Mediterranean  the  Hellespont  and adjacent Islands  and  Italian  all the Tongues I am Master of but he did not understand me  All this time my Brother lay Senseless and his Condition almost brought me to Despair but the Surgeon comforted me by telling us as soon as we came on Board he had Cordials that wou'd restore him for he assur'd me he was not dead I comforted the Fair  Fatima  as I thought her to be as well as I could but judge my Surprize when she gave me such Answers that assur'd me she was not her we had ventur'd our Lives for The Knowledge of this almost made me lose my Senses I rav'd and tore my Hair and wou'd have thrown myself into the Sea in order to swim back to the Shore and recover her or lose my Life But it cou'd not be for just as we got on Board our Vessel we perceiv'd a  Moorish  Galley coming out of the Port we cut our Anchor and made all the Sail we cou'd to get from 'em and as if Heaven took our Parts a brisk Gale arose  that was fair for our Purpose so that when the Morning dawn'd we lost Sight of her  In the mean time my Brother came to his Senses but when he learn'd that we had fail'd of our Purpose he swoon'd again and every body thought he wou'd have expir'd it was a full Hour before he open'd his Eyes but then utter'd such Complaints as melted us into Pity that understood him The Surgeon my Governor and I were all standing about him persuading him to be dress'd but he utterly refus'd it No said he since my dear  Fatima  is lost for ever 'tis in vain to think of persuading me to live Immediately after this we were surpris'd to see the young  Moor  rush into the Cabbin and looking stedfastly on my Brother give a great Shriek and fall senseless at my Feet My Brother turning his heavy Eyes that way cry'd out Oh Heavens what do I see Why wou'd you use me thus cruelly We soon understood by his Transports that the disguis'd Youth was his lovely  Fatima    Our Joys were now as extravagant as our Sorrows were before She soon came to herself and running to the Bed where my Brother lay fainted away again No Words I am sure cou'd have the Force to discover so  sincere a Passion and we all wept for Joy to see such Tenderness It was some time before their Transports had Leisure to mind those about 'em and it wou'd have continu'd longer if the Surgeon had not let us know it might endanger my Brother's Life Therefore I prevail'd upon her to withdraw while his Wound was dress'd I then went to make my Compliments to the other Lady who was still upon Deck in the utmost Confusion for I must own the Disappointment we suppos'd she had occasion'd made me entirely neglect her I soon made her easy and let her into some Part of our Story and began to inquire what strange Fortune had brought her to those Circumstances we found her in She related to us her short Story as follows  Gentlemen I am Daughter to an  English  Merchant that has resided upwards of Ten Years at  Leghorn  My Father had contracted me to one of his Countrymen that liv'd at  Naples  He came to  Leghorn  to see me we lik'd each other and were marry'd My Husband being oblig'd to go to  Venice  by Land I was embark'd in a  Felucca  for  Naples  but a Storm came upon us that drove us from  our Course We were taken by a  Corsair  of  Tunis  where I was sold to a young  Moor  who intended me for his  Seraglio  But I was resolv'd sooner to suffer Death than yield to his Embraces Last Night he was resolv'd to force me if I wou'd not comply willingly to his base Desires and was going to execute his horrible Purpose the Moment you enter'd the Garden but the Cries of his Slaves alarming him he ran to his Arms and left me I hearing the  English  Tongue spoke among you hop'd you might be Christians disguis'd as it prov'd therefore resolv'd to put myself in your Hands not knowing any thing of the Mistake which Heaven has I hope brought to a joyful End I shall ever acknowledge the Blessing I have receiv'd from you and I am assur'd both my Father and Husband will return you suitable Thanks for redeeming me from Infamy and Slavery and if you think fit to put my Ransom at Ten Thousand Crowns I'll engage it shall be paid either at  Leghorn  or  Naples    I let her know we were Gentlemen above such mercenary Ends and I shou'd think the Obligation sufficiently paid by sending her to her Father or Husband which she thought  fit when we arriv'd at  Genoa  I might have known indeed reply'd the Lady by your Countenances and Actions you are not of the vulgar Strain however I hope you'll be so good to acquaint me who are my Preservers that I may ever remember you in my Prayers and wish you eternal Felicity in this World and the next I let her know I wou'd take an Opportunity to satisfy her when my Brother was out of Danger His Hurt mended every Hour and before we arriv'd at  Genoa  he cou'd with the help of a Cane walk upon Deck in calm Weather As we set out secretly from thence we took care to be as secret in our returning back  I rewarded our Men above their Expectation tho' not more than I thought they deserv'd for it must be own'd our Undertaking was very hazardous and the Success was far beyond even my Hopes neither had we any one that receiv'd the least Hurt but my Brother When I shew'd him the Scimitar of the  Moor  I had slain he soon knew it to be that of his barbarous Master's as he call'd him and the fair  Fatima  cou'd not hear the Death of her cruel Brother tho' born of different Mothers without shedding Tears which only shew'd the Excellency of her Nature  for sure she had Reason enough to wish his Death  She told us when she heard he had sold my Brother to the Captain of the Corsair it gave her an infinite Satisfaction for she knew those sort of Persons understood the Value of Money so well they wou'd be easily prevail'd upon to part with any thing for that shining Dross I sent that very Night said  Fatima  relating her Story to the  Jew  an Account of what had befell the Slave he was to redeem with a strict Charge to finish the Affair the next Day The next Morning as I was sitting alone with all my Thoughts employ'd about my Love and casting about my Escape for I was assur'd of my dear  Vaughan  's Freedom my old Slave interrupted my Meditations with the fatal News of his being carry'd away the Night before The Terrors I felt took away my Senses and I continu'd several Hours in a Swoon When I reviv'd my Tears flow'd incessantly and my faithful Slave with all her Goodnature cou'd not give me any Consolation It was two Days before I cou'd be prevail'd upon to take any Nourishment But the  Jew  inform'd my old Slave that the Corsair did not intend to make more than a Four Months Voyage therefore  having some faint Hopes of seeing my Love again I resolv'd to live till the Time was expir'd  During that tedious Time my Life was made more uneasy by the barbarous Treatment of my Brother who was resolv'd to wed me to one of his Acquaintance that as he often said he might get rid of one he hated He brought him to see me though against the Custom of the  Moors  and I had the Illfortune to please him too well I need not tell you that Brothers among the  Turks  and  Moors  have an absolute Command over their Sisters and the Wives of their deceas'd Father Therefore the Day was fix'd for our Nuptials which was to have been three Days after I had made my Escape After that barbarous Decree my Brother gave me more Liberty than usual therefore I had an Opportunity of conveying a  Turkish  Habit into the little SummerHouse where I had often convers'd with the Charmer of my Soul the Key of which I had kept ever since the Death of my Father By degrees I carry'd all my Gold and Jewels there and that very Night you came to relieve me was the Night I had fix'd upon for my Escape first giving my old faithful Slave her Liberty with a Sum  of Money to make her meanly happy for the rest of her Life even with my Brother's Consent I had but just dress'd myself and secur'd my little Fortune when I was alarm'd with a confus'd Noise of People in the Garden and imagining they were coming to seize me rush'd out of the Gate and flew as fast as my weak Limbs wou'd permit me yet in the Terrors of my Apprehensions I knew not where I was going I must own I was very much frighted at meeting a Stranger yet I thought it was better than falling into the Hands of any of the People of  Tunis  I soon knew you were upon some clandestine Design tho' every Body speaking  Italian  I cou'd not understand what was spoke and the Thoughts of what Fortune might attend me gave me many terrible and uneasy Apprehensions  The Appearance of a wounded Person and the Sight of a  Moorish  Lady as I took her to be you brought along with you soon convinc'd me you had succeeded in your Design I did intend to discover myself to her hoping she wou'd give me her Protection I spoke to her in the  Arabian  Language but was surpriz'd to find I was not understood And immediately after perceiving the Discontent  that spread itself over all your Faces I cou'd not help endeavouring to find it out imagining I heard  English  spoke among you doubled my Curiosity I need not tell you my Surprize when I heard the Voice of my dear  Vaughan  repeat my Name whose lov'd Accents were ever in my Ears You saw the violent Working of my Soul and brought me from Death to Life a Life of Joy and Transport  The unlook'dfor Happiness of these four Lovers made me once more think of my own uncertain Fate and of my dear  Isabella  who was never from my Thoughts  My Uncle's Intention at first was that I shou'd make the whole Tour of  Italy  but the unfortunate End of my dear Father was the Cause of his desiring my immediate Return as he mention'd in my last Letter and I can't but own maugre my Curiosity which was very prevalent I was pleas'd to think I shou'd see my dear  Isabella  before the tedious Time prefix'd for my Return  Finding no Vessel ready to carry us to  Marseilles  where we had agreed to go by Sea we embark'd for  Leghorn  and the rather that we might return the Lady we had brought  from  Tunis  safe among her Friends We embark'd on Board a  Felucca  but had the Mortification to find the young Nobleman in the Vessel bound for  Leghorn  the Relation of my Governor's mention'd before Our Uneasiness was the more on the Account of the Fair  Eliza  who never durst appear upon Deck notwithstanding her Disguise for fear of being known by him neither wou'd my Governor once come in his Sight And to add to my Misfortune I was oblig'd to share Cabbins with him or lie upon Deck  During our short Voyage he seem'd goodnatur'd to a Degree but was so officiously Talkative and Troublesome he was hardly to be bore ever plaguing me with Stories of his successful Amours  I was said he desperately in Love with a Lady at  Genoa  who suspecting I had a Passion for another Woman whom I must own I had an Affair with when first I arriv'd wou'd not let me alone before I had wrote her a Letter to convince her of my Coolness But not understanding the  Italian  Language well enough to write my self I was oblig'd to employ a Countryman of ours to write it for me which I transcrib'd and by the Consequence that follow'd for I  shou'd have been murder'd if I had staid any longer at  Genoa  I believe I had not fair Play from my Friend in the Translation I know you are a Master of that Language and I shou'd take it for a singular Favour if you wou'd once more render it into  English  that I may be a better Judge of my Countryman's Sincerity I must own I took it from him to translate that I might be rid of his Company for some time The Contents of this fine Letter were as follows  MADAM  I  OWN I have receiv'd Proofs of your Passion but what then Do you think a young  English  Traveller can he confin'd to one Woman No no more than he can he satisfy'd with viewing one Country I find myself like the Bee willing to taste the Sweets of every Flower And as I intend to visit the most celebrated Cities of  Europe  I design to have a Mistress at every Place I come to if it he only to learn the Difference of the various Race of Females I own I lik'd you the best of any Woman I ever saw till I found one that pleas'd my Fancy better and now I despise you as much as ever I lov'd you Make yourself happy with the first Lover that addresses you and  never think of One that has forgot you long ago till the Writing of this Letter Time hung heavy upon my Hands and another Reason was I have so much Compassion for you that I wou'd not have you think I'll ever wear your Chains again therefore the troublesome Fetters may serve some other Fool for none but Fools wou'd always sacrifice their Incense to one Idol where there are so many amiable Divinities to draw our Devotions one from another Farewell and he happy if you can without me for I certainly am and will he happy without ever being  Yours  c  The Sense of this Letter gave me a more despicable Opinion of the Fool that wrote it and I must own the Trouble I was forc'd to endure in having his impertinent Company gave me very much Uneasiness for during our Voyage I was oblig'd to appear as a Stranger to my Brother my Governor and the Ladies for fear he shou'd come to know 'em But our Arrival at  Leghorn  after a Voyage of Five Days gave me some Repose for as soon as he landed he took a PostChaise for  Florence  and rid us of his most troublesome Company Tho' he return'd  in a Week and went back in the same Vessel for  Genoa  again I must own Foreigners may justly have a Contempt for our Nation when too many that travel have the same Sentiments with this young Impertinent  As soon as we landed we conducted the Lady to her Father's House where we found the whole Family in Mourning We did not immediately discover her to him but pretended our Business with him was only to recommend us to a House where we might reside during our Stay in  Leghorn  He told us if we cou'd be contented with a melancholy Family we might make use of his House as if it were our own We thank'd him for the Favour and by degrees got out of him the Reason of his Mourning My Brother being a Man of some Mirth told him he believ'd by the Art of Divination he cou'd in less than Five Minutes inform him whether he shou'd ever see his Daughter again and the Day and the Hour of their Meeting But the Merchant express'd some Uneasiness as imagining my Brother made a Jest of his Sorrows Nay Sir said my Governor don't look grave at what the Gentleman proposes to you for I can assure you he  has an admirable Knowledge that way What my Governor said seem'd only to add to his Confusion Pray Sir said I tell me one Thing is your Soninlaw here or at  Naples  Gentlemen return'd our kind Host I must own you look like such pray don't laugh at the Misfortunes of a mourning Family whose Distress is never to be forgot my unfortunate Soninlaw is now in the House with me but such a Picture of Unhappiness that cannot be look'd on without Compassion and I fear his Death in a very short time will add to our Mourning I began to think the unexpected Sight of the Lady might be as prejudicial as their Sorrow therefore told him in a few Words by degrees the Adventure of the Lady and fetch'd her out of a Room where she was conceal'd and had heard all to throw herself at his Feet When she appear'd he stood fix'd in Astonishment for some time but when he was convinc'd it was his Daughter that knelt before him the Tears of Joy gush'd out so fast that stopt the Utterance of his Tongue When his extravagant Transport was a little abated he went up to his Soninlaw and after staying some time brought him down with him he appear'd the very Shadow of a Human  Form and notwithstanding he had been prepar'd for the tender Interview as soon as he enter'd the Room he sunk speechless into his Fatherinlaw's Arms We thought it proper to retire into another Apartment during this dumb Scene It was some time before they came to us but the Redundancy of their Gratitude had almost overwhelm'd us We intended to stay but three or four Days at  Leghorn  Leghorn  is a SeaPort mention'd by  Polybius Antoninus  and the famous  Roman  Orator  Cicero  It formerly belong'd to the States of  Genoa  but  Cosmo de Medicis  Duke of  Florence  exchang'd it with their State for  Serezana  On the Key stands that noble Statue in Marble of  Ferdinand  I with four  Turkish  Slaves chain'd at each Corner of the Pedestal they represent an old Man and his three Sons who were put to Death in that Place for attempting to run away with one of the Gallies of the State in order to regain their Liberty  Leghorn  is a noble rich Town of great Trade wellfortify'd and a convenient safe Port that freely opens its Arms to embrace the Merchandise of all  Europe  Even the Outsides of many of the noble Buildings have Paintings too good to be expos'd to the Injuries of the Weather And the Insides are so profusely decorated with Statues Pictures Intaglias  c  that the Beholder wou'd imagine himself in so many Poetical Inchanted Palaces Their chief Trade consists of  Florence  Wine Oil and Anchoves Tho' there are constantly small Vessels in the Port laden with Wine of  Sardinia Corsica  and  Languedoc  which is drank on Board to avoid paying the Duty so that each Vessel is a Public Tavern and notwithstanding there are frequent Disorders committed yet they go on with Impunity and no Notice taken of 'em by the State  but we were press'd so  obligingly that a whole Month pass'd away before they wou'd hear of our moving and then with the utmost Reluctance  We visited  Florence  Florence  the Capital City of the Great Duke of  Tuscany  was built by  Sylla  in the Year of  Rome  SeventySix Years before the Birth of Christ situated upon the River  Arno  It justly carries the Epithet of  Fibrenza Iu  bella  by the  Italians Florence the Fair  There is a noble Column with the Statue of Justice on the Top of which the meaner sort of Inhabitants say  Justice it plac'd so high that poor People cannot reach her  By Computation it contains Inhabitants  Charles the Great  in the Year of Grace very much enlarg'd it and built a new Wall with the Addition of Turrets Cubits high But its present Strength must consist of the Inhabitants for the Fortifications seem more Ornamental than Useful A Council was held here in the Year to the Year to unite the  Greek  and  Latin  Churches  Anno Domini    Jerome Savdnarola  a holy religious Man was burnt by the Populace for reproving the Vices of this City  John Cimaba  was the first eminent Painter in the Year that began to restore that noble Art almost buried in the Ruins of Time which since has spread itself almost over  Europe  The Trade of this Place is much decay'd and seems now to center at  Leghorn  The  Tuscan  Dialect is esteem'd to be the most refin'd  Italian  but their Guttural Pronunciation has occasion'd this  Italian  Proverb  La Lingua Toscana in bocca Romana  The  Tuscan  Tongue must have a  Roman  Mouth  and saw all the Rarities of the Great Duke's Repository which  is certainly one of the noblest Entertainments in the World at least it appear'd so to me and my Company  When we came back to  Leghorn  in order to prepare for our Journey a violent Fever attack'd me that confin'd me to my Apartment for near two Months which I can attribute to nothing more than the Anxiety of my Mind and as most Fevers are attended with Deliriums I was for ever crying out of the Infidelity of my dear  Isabella  even when my Illness was gone the Lowness of my Spirits gave Force to my Imagination and those uneasy Thoughts retarded my Strength  One Day taking the Air upon the Water the Master of the  Felucca  that brought us from  Genoa  passing by in a Boat told me he believ'd I had left a Packet of Letters in my Cabbin which he wou'd bring me if I wou'd give him a Direction I did not remember I had lost any thing however I  desired he would send 'em where I lodg'd the next Day When he brought 'em they were seal'd up Sir said the  Italian  I found they were in a Language I did not understand and not knowing the Consequence I seal'd 'em up and left 'em at my Lodgings directed for you or the young Gentleman that shar'd my Cabbin with you imagining one of you wou'd search after 'em before I return'd from  Genoa  where I have been twice since I brought you to  Leghorn  and if I had not met you accidentally Yesterday I shou'd have committed them to the Flames before I went back to  Genoa  I thank'd him for his Civility and opening the Packet found they were directed for my  English  Companion I had in the  Felucca  against my Will I laid 'em among my other Papers not having any Curiosity to peruse 'em with an Intention to give 'em the right Owner if ever I should have the Misfortune to see him again But when I told my Governor and Brother at Dinner of my Packet they seem'd willing to know the Contents that they might have a farther Occasion to despise the Gentleman or at least to make themselves merry with his fine Epistles After Dinner we went to my Apartment and  taking out the Packet I gave it my Brother to read The first was as follows  DEAR SIR  IT is with infinite Joy I am inform'd of your Health and to communicate some of that Pleasure to you I must acquaint you my Father is gone to visit the Residence of his Ancestors that is in plain  English  I have bury'd him sumptuously His Death you know has made me Master of  l  a Year and the Liberty of pursuing my Pleasures without Restraint But I think it's a great Pity the  Japan  Law concerning Children is not of Force in  England  There is a Law in the Empire of  Japan  or a Custom as strong as a Law That all Fathers of any Nobility resign their Estates to their eldest Sons when they have reach'd their Twentieth Year or Five and Twenty at the farthest The Fathers generally retire to some Castle and spend the Remnant of their Lives in contemplating the Vanities of this World but are always ready to give their Sons proper Advice in their Worldly Affairs if the Son thinks fit to ask it Some Fathers retire among the  Bonzies  or Priests and never enter into Conversation with any of the World despising the Pomp and Sple  of it ending their Days in mortifying their Flesh  The old Put of a Pere forsooth in his Lifetime talk'd to me of Virtue Morality  and I know not what Stuff Dinning ever in my Ears that Nobility without Virtue was like an eminent barren Mountain seen and slighted  I have once more made my Addresses to  Isabella  with all the glaring Equipage of Nobility and Fortune but she's as cold as a Cucumber But I have found out the Reason of that Coldness It seems she's damnably in Love with that young learned Blockhead  Vaughan  I'll tell you how I came by that Knowledge In one of my Visits at her Mother's House I was told the young Lady had been some time in the Garden I made no Scruple of following her But you must think I was something surpriz'd to find her asleep in a retir'd Arbor with a Letter in her Hand from that wretched Coxcomb you and I have so often laugh'd at who shou'd have been well whip'd by me for his Impudence before he went from  England  but that I thought it was beneath me to chastise a SchoolBoy  I took away the Letter without any manner of Ceremony and shew'd it to her Mother and Aunt but was very much surpriz'd to find they had no Resentment against  Vaughan  nor the Girl for such a Discovery tho' I found it was new to them They both coolty told me  Isabella  's Inclinations shou'd never be forc'd yet if I cou'd gain her Consent theirs would soon follow In short there's nothing to be done with the young Girl and I own I think I  ou'd like her even for a Year or two Now I have learnt by Piecemeal that  Vaughan  in  ends to travel the Way you design If you meet with him which is very likely can't you recommend him to some  Italian  Man of Business Or rather find some Method by Letter to make  Isabella  believe he has got him a Mistress in his Travels Ay that will do in my Opinion better Then her Resentment may bring her to my Arms for upon second Thoughts  t is not quite generous to take away his Life since now I remember he once was in some Danger in saving mine Besides if I could accomplish my Affair with  Isabella  I don't know but he might be Fool enough to hang himself and then my Revenge will be compleat If you can think of some Way you will very much oblige me I shall find no Difficulty in deceiving  Isabella  However the sooner the better for  n short if I can't find some Method speedily I must ev'en ravish her I think and make an End of the Business that way Our Friend  Dick  is dead of the  Surgeon  but it is his own Fault I told him the Danger he was in  if he convers'd longer with the Lady you wot of in  GermanStreet  without consulting a Surgeon but he slighted my Advice and therefore he has answer'd that Folly with his Life My dear Friend I wish you sounder Mistresses than  Dick  's and hope you will remember  Yours for ever  The Reading of this Letter gave me the most horrid Apprehensions my Soul ever knew I call'd to mind the Letter I translated from the  Italian  at the Desire of that Wretch not doubting in the least but that was the Engine made to destroy all my Peace In the first Transports of my Fury I said and did the most extravagant things imaginable to the Surprize of all the Company  The first Letter was directed to  Paris  and the second to  Genoa  My Brother casting his Eyes cursorily over the second I perceiv'd his Colour change seeming very unwilling to read it I snatch'd it out of his Hands and to my Surprize and Terror found I was utterly destroy'd  My dear Friend  I  Receiv'd your last Packet with more Transports than I ever felt from the sweet consenting Embraces of a Mistress I think your Policy in overreaching that contemptible Coxcomb  Vaughan  exceeds even  Machiavel  for Cunning and I don't doubt but breathing the same Air and being in the same Climate where that Prince of Politicians was born inspir'd you But I must tell you how Fortune assisted me in carrying on the Deceit  You know the Letter  Vaughan  translated by your Instigation was not seal'd I by good Fortune was at  Isabella  's Mother's where I met the Uncle of  Vaughan  I took an Occasion to borrow his Seal and with it seal'd that Letter intended for  Isabella  their Arms being the same you may be assur'd it help'd my Design  Two Days after this I got trusty  Roger  my cunning Dog of a Footman to put on a Sailor's Dress and deliver the Letter to  Isabella  when I was present I had order'd him to tell her he receiv'd that Letter with many others from some  English  Gentlemen at  Genoa  The young Lady blush'd and trembled when she receiv'd it viewing the Seal very circumspectly but the Hand of the Direction  not being the same that was expected from the Seal she seem'd to be in the utmost Consternation However there was no one to make Observations upon her Looks but myself her Mother and Aunt being gone some Moments before  Roger  came with the Letter to dress themselves in order to make a Visit and  Isabella  was to go along with them The young Lady went into the Garden in order to read the dear Epistle with more Freedom and staid so long there that the Mother with the Aunt came down drest order'd the Coach to the Door and inquir'd after her I told 'em a Sailor had brought the young Lady a Letter from  Genoa  from one I suppos'd she was very glad to hear from for she chang'd Countenance several times then went to the Garden to enjoy the Contents alone The Mother and Aunt seem'd very much disturb'd at my short Story and follow'd  Isabella  into the Garden without giving me one Word in return Some Moments after I was a little surpriz'd I own to see the Aunt return in great Haste calling to the Servants for Water The House was all in an Uproar and I soon understood  Isabella  was in a fainting Fit This gave me some little Uneasiness to think she lov'd another so well yet I bury'd it soon knowing violent Passions never last long  Isabella  was brought in by the Servants to  Appearance void of Life with the Mother and Aunt weeping over her They put her to Bed but as fast as she recover'd out of one fainting Fit she fell into another In short the Family was in so much Distraction for several Hours that I thought it proper to retire without Ceremony feeding on the Hopes this Disturbance would produce  I sent the next Morning to inquire of  Isabella  's Health and was inform'd she was in a violent Fever The Messenger brought me a Note from the Aunt that told me  her Niece was often troubled with a bad Digestion and those fainting Fits were too common with her yet that was the worst she ever had  c I own my dear  Ned  I cou'd not help smiling at the Note but however I found by it they intended the true Reason should be a Secret and you know it was my Interest not to divulge it  In about ten Days after this Affair I ventur'd to make 'em another Visit where I found  Isabella  so much alter'd that in reality I pity'd her She look'd as if she was going to her Grave but notwithstanding her Paleness her Charms were as powerful as ever and I own I love her more and more every time I see her  One thing gave me infinite Pleasure at this Visit I observ'd her Looks were not so full of Scorn when she cast her Eyes upon me I did not mention my Passion for several Days but the Respect I treated her with and the Tenderness I express'd for her melancholy Indisposition seem'd grateful to all the Family  When I once more mention'd my Love  Isabella  only sigh'd and shed Tears but did not rally me as she was wont to do In short I follow'd my Business so close that the whole Family gave me their Consent and  Isabella  now treats me as her future Husband She has freely declar'd to me the Passion she once had for  Vaughan  and only begs our Nuptials may be delay'd till she can wholly give me that Heart the other so little deserv'd This Declaration is no Secret tho' the Cause is not known out of the Family  Vaughan  's Uncle has been very much busy'd about some Concerns of his Brother's Family who is lately dead together with his Wife and a Son of hers And it is whisper'd in the Neighbourhood as if some poisoning Work had been done in the Family by the Wife tho' she has suffer'd herself I only wish the Knowledge of it when it reaches your raw Traveller may prove a  Mittimus  to convey him into another World for fear our Plot  should be discover'd However when I have wedded  Isabella  I shall take care to put Bounds to her Liberty I mean if my Love should continue after Wedlock which I begin to think no impossible thing  Vaughan  's Uncle this Morning came to pay his Respects to the Family as usual but the Mother the Aunt and  Isabella  order'd the Servants to say they were abroad The old Gentleman return'd home something chagrin'd I suppose his Visits there for the future will be thought only a Trouble to the Family My dear  Ned  I shan't write to you any more till our Nuptials are over which I hope will be in two Months at the farthest However let me know where you intend to be that I may be sure where my Epistle may find you And I wish thee as happy with thy  Italian  Dames as I hope to be in two Months in the Embraces of the charming  Isabella  And next to her be assur'd to share the Heart of  Your obliged Friend and Servant  c c c  At the Reading of this villainous Letter all my Fortitude Resolution and Philosophy left me my disorder'd Soul whisper'd  my Heart to put an end to my wretched Being which I had certainly done if the Thoughts of Revenge had not bid me live I immediately gave Orders for my Journey to  England  but my impatient Fancy outrun all Expedition Yet the Tumult of my Spirits threw me into another violent Fever and tho' every one thought it would be certain Death to remove from the Place where I was yet I order'd a Litter and the next Morning pursu'd my Journey attended with my Governor  Eliza  my Brother the fair  Fatima  and Servants  Eliza  in our first Day's Journey was taken with a sudden Indisposition that prevented our going any further that Day We were far from any Town and it was with great Difficulty we found Accommodation at a little Village a Mile from the main Road I was agitated with so much impatient Passion that my Friends found it a hard Task to persuade me from leaving them behind and pursuing my Journey with my two Servants The next Morning  Eliza  was much better but to my great Mortification I was so weak that I had not Strength enough to rise without Help yet notwithstanding my Condition I order'd my Litter to be got  ready but was inform'd the Men went away with it back to  Leghorn  early in the Morning I lost all Patience at the Disappointment and fell out with my Friends not doubting tho' they deny'd it but it was their Contrivance to prevent my Journey during my Weakness In short my Illness redoubled its Attacks and took such strong Possession of the Outworks that it was the Opinion of every one about me my Life could not hold out much longer My Senses left me and a strong Distraction seiz'd my Soul But even in those Fits of Madness Revenge was uppermost for they inform'd me when I came out of those Possessions all my Ravings were upon  Isabella  and my Rival threatning Death to Both  The Place where we were had but little Accommodation for us even in Health and much less for a Person in my Condition therefore my Brother unknown to me apply'd himself to a neighbouring Gentleman who freely granted us the Use of his House I was remov'd there and having the Advice of the best Physicians from  Florence  my Distemper by degrees left me but I still continu'd in such a weak Condition it was impossible for me to remove so soon as my  Impatience wou'd have me I was well assur'd the Time affix'd for the fatal Nuptials was elaps'd therefore my Heart began to feel some Ease in the Resolution I had taken in the Revenging the Loss of my Love by the Death of my hated Rival or falling a Victim to my Misfortunes This Hope gave me room to gather some Strength which in a few Days increas'd so much that I cou'd walk in the Garden which was one of those noble ones in  Italy  that surpass even many Princes in other Countries But what was my Surprize when in a neighbouring Arbor I heard the Voice of that Wretch singing an  Italian  Air who by his damnable Wiles had prevail'd upon me to translate that Letter which was the sole Cause of all my Misfortunes My Fury gave me Strength enough to fly to the Place from whence I heard his detested Voice As soon as I came near him I could not help crying out with the utmost Transport of Fury Villain thy last Moment is approaching I never once consider'd I had no other Weapon than a Cane to assist me in walking which I thrust against his Breast with such Violence that he fell backwards in a mighty Fright However finding it was no offensive Weapon I  had in my Hand he drew his Sword and made several Thrusts at me which I parry'd with my Cane for some time and at last with much Difficulty disarm'd him But the Violence of the Exercise being too strong for my weak Condition I fell to the Ground almost Senseless The Wretch seeing that recover'd his Sword and with all his Strength stabb'd me thro' the Shoulder the Sword enter'd so far into the Earth that he made several fruitless Attempts to pull it out again I had just Sense enough to know what he was doing without any Power to prevent him But my Brother  Jonathan  coming upon the Instant put an end to his vain Efforts by laying him breathless at my Feet with a Blow of his Sword He then came to my Assistance leaving the Wretch weltring in his Blood The Family and my Friends were soon alarm'd tho 'no one cou'd come to the true Knowledge of this Quarrel for the present but the Appearances seem'd strong against the other because I had no Sword However the Gentleman of the House took care of him as having some small Acquaintance with him He inform'd us that the villainous Wretch waited for a Servant that he had sent to  Leghorn  for a  Packet of Letters which I too well knew were those the Captain deliver'd to me When my Wound was drest I inform'd the Gentleman of all that befell me When he heard his barbarous Policy to undo my Peace he exclaim'd against his Conduct vowing never to give him any Countenance for the future  My Wound was not dangerous tho' the Loss of Blood contributed to my Weakness but the Wretch that gave it me seem'd in a very dangerous Condition for the Blow my Brother gave him had fractur'd his Skull and the Violence of the Pain often took away his Senses Yet in his Intervals he talk'd of nothing but Revenge declaring to every one that came to visit him my Brother's Blood should make Atonement for the Torment he suffer'd As for myself he had sufficiently punish'd me in being the Instrument of robbing me of all that cou'd make me happy in this World I must own I was in some Fear for my Brother therefore was for leaving the Place as soon as possible But the  Italian  Gentleman in whose House we were advis'd us not to pursue our Journey by Land He laid before me the many Difficulties we shou'd meet with and convinc'd me we  shou'd make our Voyage sooner by imbarking for  Marseilles  and travelling thro  France  by Land The  Alps  at this Time of the Year he assur'd us were cover'd with Snow and many had perish'd by mistaking the Road The Consideration of the two Ladies prevail'd upon me more than any Danger I fear'd therefore we were determin'd as soon as possible to return to  Leghorn  and procure a Vessel to carry us to  Marseilles    My Wound was so well heal'd in six Days after I receiv'd it that the seventh I resolv'd with my Companions to venture on Horseback in order to return to  Leghorn  But when the Time came my Brother was not to be found We made all the Enquiry imaginable to no purpose but what gave me some small Satisfaction was that  Fatima  assur'd me he was gone to  Leghorn  to provide a Vessel for our Voyage I own I much wonder'd he had not inform'd us of his Design but as the fair  Fatima  seem'd very easy I thought I had no Reason to be otherwise  We took Leave of our friendly  Italian  tho' I must own I parted with some Regret from that infamous Wretch who was the Cause of all my Sorrows without giving him the Punishment due to his Crimes However  I did not doubt but the Justiee of Heaven would overtake him and I found some Consolation in overcoming my just Resentment  We pursu'd our Journey for  Leghorn  where we arriv'd the next Day without any Accident but upon Enquiry after my Brother we cou'd learn no News of him I began then to be very uneasy and observ'd a Gloom on  Fatima  's Countenance notwithstanding all her Endeavours to conceal it Several Days past in this Uncertainty till  Fatima  's Fears began to be too powerful for her Prudence yet all my Persuasions cou'd not get the Reason of my Brother's Absence from her tho' she confess'd to me she knew it My Governor  Eliza  and I had many Conjectures but none could give us any Consolation especially since we observ'd  Fatima  began to be inconsolable and confess'd his Stay was beyond the Time prefix'd We press'd her on all sides to declare to us the Reason of his unexpected Absence with this Persuasion that it was possible the Knowledge of it might be of Service to him but all our Intreaties prov'd ineffectual Yet she declar'd if we had no Tidings of him in two Day she wou'd confess to us the Secret  We went to Bed full of Terrors and for my own Part Sleep was a Stranger to me But in the middle of the Night I was alarm'd with a violent Knocking at the Gate the Servants of the House not rising at the second Alarm I slipt on my Gown and with my Sword in my Hand went down into the CourtYard but guess my Surprize when asking  Who was there  I heard my Brother's Voice I open'd the Gate and my Surprize was doubled when I found my Brother on Horseback at the Head of a Litter with a sick Man in it attended by four Servants But when I found the Person within it was the Wretch that had wounded me in the Garden of the  Italian  Gentleman my Wonder ty'd up my Tongue and my Company who by this time were come to us stood like so many Statues struck with the Sight of  Medusa  's Head At last observing my Brother's Diligence in helping him out of the Litter in a seeming Trance we all involuntarily gave him our Assistance without knowing what we were doing We put him into Bed and then follow'd my Brother out of the Room leaving his Servants and a Surgeon with him that came in their Company  without speaking a Word so full of Wonder that our Tongues seem'd of no Use to us  When we came down into the Hall my Brother tenderly embrac'd us all tho' his dear  Fatima  could not speak yet the Tears of Joy that fell from her fair Eyes convinc'd us all of the tender Love she bore him When we were seated some time gazing silently at one another my Brother began his Story as follows  My dear Brother I must first beg your Pardon for concealing from you what I am going to relate but my Reason for it was that you wou'd not have given your Consent to what I design'd to do Two Days before we intended to leave our friendly  Italian  I receiv'd that Letter which he gave me to read  To JONATHAN VAUGHAN  Esq  YOU may perhaps imagine I shall forget the Injury I suffer'd from you But be assur'd the Moment I have Strength enough to draw a Sword I shall expect Satisfaction for your cowardly Treatment In a Day or two  more I shall be able to punish you for the Wound you gave me if that Person can have Courage enough to look a Man in the Face who would stab him behind his Back The Gentleman of the House my Friend being impos'd upon by your false Legend has withdrawn his Kindness from me but I hope by your Punishment to let him see how you have slander'd basely one that cannot forget the Injury without washing off your Crime with your Blood All I fear is that this Notice will make you fly from my just Resentment but no Place on Earth shall hide you from my Chastisement My Rage shou'd correct your Brother for his Illmanners in reading those Letters you were all well assur'd belong'd to me But I know his Curiosity carry'd his Punishment along with it Yet when I have with my Sword let out your Treachery and Baseness I may think it worth my while to scourge him for that Folly that can have no other Excuse than the childish Curiosity of a Boy who left his School before he had been well whipp'd for his Impertinence  P S  The third Morning after receiving this between the Hours of Five and Eight I shall expect to see you alone with a single Sword  in the Meadow by the River  The River  Arno  or  Arnus  the chief River of  Tustany  in  Italy  takes its Rise in the  Apennine  Hiils near the Source of the River  Tiber  that runs thro'  Rome  The River  Arno  washes the Walls of  Florence  and is Navigable from thence to  Leghorn  where it empties itself into the Sea  Arno  a Furlong from the House  This Letter was given me continu'd my Brother by a Servant who told me he was order'd by his Master to wait the next Morning in the same Place for an Answer The Letter I own gave me much Concern I advis'd with my dear  Fatima  and with much Difficulty got her Consent to send an Answer in which I promis'd to meet him at the Time and Place appointed I assur'd  Fatima  I would be with you in eight Days at the farthest and for that time she gave me her Word to keep the Affair a Secret from every one The Morning I parted from her was with the utmost Sorrow She took her Leave of me as if she was never to see me more I retir'd with my Servant full of Grief to the little Cottage upon the Skirts of the Mead  where I gave myself up to examine my Conscience and endeavour'd to make my Peace with Heaven tho' I own to you I thought I was going to do a Deed not in the least acceptable to God As soon as the appointed Morning came I arose giving my Servant Orders to observe the Combat and if it was my Fate to fall he shou'd immediately repair to you after laying me in the Earth and give you an Account of my End  About Six o' Clock I perceiv'd my Antagonist coming slow and pensive along the Skirts of the Meadow When he came nearer to me I observ'd he had been weeping Tears said I can make but poor Atonement for the many Injuries thou hast heap'd upon my poor Brother and Me therefore betake thee to thy Sword that I may chastise thy Perfidy He made me no Answer but drawing his Sword I made a full Pass at him which he opening his Arms receiv'd into his Breast and fell towards me upon his Face with the Point of my Sword out at his Back I was very much surpriz'd at his manner of Proceeding and calling my Servant who waited at some Distance we both rais'd him up Forbear said he and think not of giving Assistance to a Wretch that rather deserves  Death from your Hands and who came on purpose to be punish'd for all those Crimes the Heat of Youth and want of Thought have made me commit I had no other way to recompense all those Ills I have done your worthy Brother but to receive Death from your Hands The Wound you formerly gave me prob'd me to the Soul my Illness gave me Leisure to think and Thought was my Monitor I knew what I had done instigated by One whose Nobility is a Stain to Virtue was the basest Act I could have committed I had no other Method to meet with the Death I desired but by writing that Letter to you I had not the Assurance to look your injur'd Brother in the Face But I beg by Honour Virtue and all the amiable Train of Goodness to plead for me to your noble Brother whose Virtues rank him above Nobility I consider'd my Crime no more than a little Artifice which would be approv'd by all the laughing Part of the World But when I weigh'd it fully in my Illness I found it the basest blackest and most inhuman Policy that ever was committed by mortal Man I often us'd to whisper to myself What Anxiety have I felt even for a Disappointment of a Day But  what must these two poor virtuous innocent abus'd Souls suffer even to the Separation of their Mortality My Wound was never so dangerous as reported But the Torments of my troubled Conscience persuaded even the Surgeon that I was often delirious when alas all my Madness was in my Mind and not in the Brain I purposely when I was calm threaten'd Revenge upon you but it was only that you might be inform'd of my false Resentment against you I well knowing your Spirit would find some Means to seek me out and punish me for my Crime as I deserv'd Even the Letter I wrote to you went to my Soul because what I wrote was against my Conscience All I desire of you is to bury me obscurely and let my Faults be forgotten in the Grave He endeavour'd to say more but his Tongue falter'd his Eyes clos'd and grafping me faintly by the Hand he sunk to the Earth in all Appearance never to rise again We took him in our Arms and with the Sword in his Breast carry'd him to the Cottage and then sent my Servant for the Surgeon that attended you both in your Illness While he was gone there seem'd no sign of Life in him I must confess his unhappy Condition had wip'd away  all Resentment in me and I felt for him all the Tenderness of a Brother and Friend washing his Face with my repentant Tears often cursing myself for the rash Act  When the Surgeon came he drew the Sword out of his Body upon which he open'd his Eyes fetching a deep Sigh but clos'd 'em immediately again However the Surgeon prob'd his Wound and gave me some Hopes it might not prove mortal We undress'd him and put him to Bed but the Surgeon desir'd we might leave the Room till the Evening he came again for he confidently assur'd us by that Time he would either be past Cure or out of Danger I own I cou'd not obey his Orders but sat by his Bedside till the Evening the Surgeon return'd and all that time I cou'd not perceive him to breathe therefore I was assur'd in myself the Soul had taken her Flight for ever The Surgeon by his Countenance seem'd to think as I did but when he took off his Plaisters from his Wounds he cry'd Courage Sir we have Hopes and great ones too I own those Words very much chear'd my drooping Spirits When he had once more dress'd him he forc'd open his Mouth and pour'd in some Cordial which upon the Instant caus'd him  to groan and some Moments after he open'd his Eyes faintly looking upon us but did not seem to know us In short it was four Days ere he came to his Senses and then the Surgeon declar'd he was out of Danger since in that time he had escap'd a Fever  I was so much concern'd for his Welfare that I had even forgot the Time I propos'd to meet you at  Leghorn  was elaps'd therefore I sent my Servant to acquaint you with the Reason of my Delay intending to follow the next Day But we were very much surpriz'd last Night to find the poor Fellow ty'd to a Tree in the Road having been robb'd of his Horse his Cloaths and Money as also severely beaten into the Bargain  Tho' the Gentleman's Wounds were almost heal'd yet he continu'd so weak that he could not get out of his Bed without Assistance yet knowing the Necessity of my being with you he would accompany me in the Litter that carry'd you a Day's Journey into the Country that I had order'd to be conceal'd in the Village to prevent my dear Brother your pursuing a rash Design that must have ended with your Life considering the Weakness of your Condition I'll wait on you said he to your worthy Brother to  obtain his Pardon or die at his Feet When he was inform'd we were near the House where you resided the Thoughts of seeing the Face of the Person he had so heinously injur'd took away his Senses and he fainted away But the Surgeon assur'd us a little Rest and Quietness would soon restore him therefore desired he might not be disturb'd for some Hours  When my Brother had ended his Relation Revenge Hate Fury with all the Train of violent Passions left my Breast and in their room soft Compassion Tenderness with Friendship took their Place Tho' I was undone thro' his Means yet a gloomy Contentment took Possession of my Soul so that I could freely pardon the Man who was the Cause of all my Misfortunes I was overcome with an ardent Longing to embrace him All the Company felt the same Sentiments with me neither cou'd we prevent the Tears gushing from our Eyes at my Brother's short Story  We all return'd to Rest and I must own I had not felt the balmy Effects of Slumber so sweet for many Days Tho' the latter Part of it was disturb'd with a Dream of my dear  Isabella  I thought she appear'd before  me with those piercing Rays of Beauty with which she first wounded my Soul  Canst thou then forsake me  she cry'd  ungrateful Wretch What have I done to merit such barbarous Usage Are these the Vows and Promises thou madest me at our cruel Separation Why didst thou betray my easy Heart to feel the Torture of Despair for ever But know thou Wretch tho' Death will soon overtake me yet I will die another's to punish thee  When she had as I thought pronounc'd these fatal Words she flew from me in a violent Rage and the Agony I felt in my Dream awak'd me in a cold Sweat all o'er my Limbs Tho' this was but a Dream yet my Mind felt all the Tortures imaginable at the Thoughts of my miserable Fortune  The next Morning my Brother inform'd us the Gentleman was better and express'd a great Desire to see me After Breakfast we all went up together At Sight of me the Tears ran down his Cheeks which choak'd the Passage of his Words for some time For Heaven's sake Sir said I do not add to my Sorrows by making me bear yours I know your Penitence and it is with the utmost Candour I now declare I heartily forgive what is past and beg to be rank'd in the  Number of your virtuous Friends This Goodness he faintly reply'd had overwhelm'd his Soul with so much Confusion that it was more than his feeble Spirits cou'd stand under and upon saying that his Speech fail'd him and a deadly Paleness overspread his Face It was a full Hour before we cou'd bring him to Life again and I began to taste all the Bitterness of Grief for his Condition When he cou'd use his Tongue he said so many humane tender things as plung'd all the Hearers in Floods of Sorrow insomuch that the Surgeon turn'd us all out of the Chamber declaring he would upon the Instant leave him if we offer'd to see him again till he thought fit  Just as we left him a Packet was given me from  England  which I knew to be my Uncle's Hand I had not wrote him any Letter for near four Months having indeed almost forgot thro' my Brother's Affairs my Sickness and my own unhappy Love I had any such Person in the World and when I did call him to mind the Intention of my Journey to  England  made it of no Signification to write I sound by the Date of the Letter it was full ten Weeks since it was wrote  My dear Child  THE Torments I endure for thy Silence are not to be describ'd It never can enter into my Mind that thou should'st forget me therefore what can I suppose Is it unnatural to think thee out of this World and that I am now writing to an Angel in Heaven Good God what Terrors does the very Thought invade me with My dear Boy should this Letter come to thy Hands consider me as one in this small Time thou hast been absent full twenty Years older than when thou sawest me last Grief has shook her Malevolence upon my Head and I am become from a facetious middleag'd Man of Fifty an old decrepid Wretch of Fourscore Thy worthy Father's Loss thy Absence and my Fears for thee have added to my Grey Hairs which I own are multiply'd by the Mother and Aunt to  Isabella  Would'st thou think it my Boy They are as strange to me as Humility to a Priest have broke off our Correspondence and to compleat all O my Child arm thyself with Patience if my Conjectures prove true are speedily going to wed  Isabella  to that upstart Nobleman you formerly had some Words with And all this without assigning any Reason to me for their Proceedings  'Tis true they have a Right to do as they think fit but it is very strange And I own my Patience and Fortitude thro' all these concurring Misfortunes can but poorly bear up against them alone Come then my dear Child and by thy Assistance I shall be able to hold out against all the Assaults of Fortune and in thy Company forget the ill Treatment of the World But if I neither see nor hear from thee very speedily my Gray Hairs will soon be brought with Sorrow to the Grave Poor  Betty  's Fears for thy Welfare almost equal mine I have taken care of ihy unhappy Father's Affairs come and take Possession of that and all that is mine But be expeditious my dear Child or thou wilt come too late to close the Eyes of  Thy dear and loving Uncle W VAUGHAN  All my Sorrows were renew'd at the reading this melancholy Epistle and I began to curse my Stars for my unthinking Backwardness in Writing and to write now seem'd to me to be of no Use because I intended to embark for  England  the next Morning However all my Friends advis'd me to send my  Uncle a Letter for fear some Accident might retard our Voyage I took their Advice and sent him one giving him a succinct Account of every thing that had befell my Brother and me since my last and of that fatal Letter which had caus'd the Coldness of  Isabella  's Family and my inevitable Ruin with a Promise to be in  England  with the utmost Expedition  The wounded Gentleman hearing we were to imbark for  Marseilles  the next Morning was resolv'd to go with us notwithstanding his weak Condition and all our Persuasions to the contrary cou'd not avail The Surgeon inform'd us the Sea would rather do him Good than Harm and he was resolv'd to attend him to  Marseilles  Therefore the next Day we left  Leghorn  with a prosperous Gale and in eight Days we arriv'd safely at  Marseilles  without meeting with any Accident by the Way The hurt Gentleman mended every Day and when we disembark'd he was able to walk without Assistance He had reconcil'd himself to my Governor and  Eliza  The Presents he made them were worthy the Gift of a Prince and unknown to me he and my Brother had settled my Father's Estate upon me and had given my Brother an  Equivalent out of his own Fortune When I complain'd to him of his profuse Generosity For Heaven's sake Sir said he accept this small Favour in Recompence for all the Misfortunes I have heap'd upon you And would to God the rest of my Estate and Life cou'd but restore what I have robb'd you of I would freely surrender both Yet who knows but Fate has still reserv'd the amiable  Isabella  to bless your Arms I am strongly possess'd with that Hope I have some Reason to believe you the Care of Providence And such Wretches as that perfidious Man and I must surely be punish'd in the Loss of all our unlawful Desires wou'd wish for All my Days to come shall be spent in begging Forgiveness from Heaven and you Sure there must be the Seeds of some Goodness even in the most profligate Heart and repentant Tears may make them flourish and kill those Weeds of Baseness that shadow'd o'er our vicious Inclinations I wou'd not be the Wretch I was some few Days ago for all the gaudy Titles of State and Grandeur  In short there was such a virtuous Alteration wrought upon him I cou'd not help esteeming him equal to my Brother His Friendship was in some sort a Cordial for  my disappointed Love for I had made a firm Resolve after the Loss of my dear  Isabella  to forget all the fatal Charms of the Sex which at best enervate the Soul of Man unbend his Mind and render him unfit for noble Actions I intended to dedicate my future Life to my King and Country My new Friend strengthen'd me in that Resolution Our Design was as soon as we arriv'd in  England  to buy us Posts in the Army and make for the future War our Mistress These Thoughts almost engross'd my whole Soul but the Idea of the charming  Isabella  wou'd too often intrude and fill my Heart with a Medley of Love and Arms  We set out from  Marseilles  in PostChaises for  Paris  where we all safely arriv'd healthful in Body tho' for my own Part with a Mind full of cruel Disturbances We were oblig'd to stay some time here to dispose of a Casket of valuable Jewels that  Fatima  brought from  Tunis  and procure Bills of Exchange for our Money for fear of Accidents But as soon as we arriv'd there I dispatch'd one of my Servants for  England  to acquaint my Uncle of my coming Here my Fever attack'd me again but I was so impatient to  come to my Journey's End that as soon as our Affairs were ended we hir'd PostChaises for  Bulloigne  where we safely arriv'd tho' late at Night but found the Gates shut against us But having Recommendations to Mr  Gordon  a WineMerchant a Gentleman just settled at  Bulloigne  he prevail'd upon the Captain of the Guard to give us Entrance and thro' his accustom'd Goodnature he wou'd accommodate us at his own House where we were nobly entertain'd He prest us so oblingly to stay some time that we appear'd almost guilty of Illmanners but Despair and Love seldom regard Forms  He finding our Affairs prest us to be gone procur'd us a Vessel to carry us to  Dover  and we embark'd the next Morning at break of Day but before the Sun was two Hours old a general Darkness o'erspread the Hemisphere follow'd by a most violent Tempest mix'd with Thunder and Lightning that the Captain of the Vessel declar'd he had never seen the like The Helm was of no Use therefore we were oblig'd under a reef'd Foresail to run before the Wind trusting to the Mercy of Providence for three Nights and Days Upon the fourth the Storm retir'd and gave us Leave to make an Observation we  were greatly surpriz'd to find we had pass'd the  Lizard  Upon this we consulted what Course we should steer but finding the Wind favourable for  Milford  Haven the Captain was prevail'd upon for a Sum of Money to steer for that Harbour The Night approaching the Tempest as if it abated only to fetch Breath came on more violently than before and all the Hopes we had of Life was to steer our Course for the open Sea Our Vessel bore up against the Storm very well for two Days but on the third the Master came into the Cabbin with Looks that told us our Misfortune he inform'd us the Vessel had sprung a Leak and should the Storm continue a Day longer we must inevitably sink to the Bottom  The Tears of my Friends I must own shock'd me very much yet for my own Part I sat in expectation of the last Moment with the utmost Tranquillity But in a few Hours the Storm very much abated yet with all our Assistance the Water gain'd upon us and no Land appearing we had no Hope of saving our Lives  The Vessel was once more left to the Mercy of the Waves whose frightful Swell tho' the Wind was laid ran Mountains high  The Master order'd the Longboat out that we might endeavour all we cou'd to save our Lives But the Mariners as soon as it was in the Water crowded so fast upon one another that the Rope which held it to the Ship's Side broke and in a Moment after the Boat was swallow'd by the Billows Three out of thirteen of the Sailors that were in it sunk to the Bottom never to be seen more alive It was with the utmost Difficulty the rest were sav'd The Sailors finding no Hope of escaping that way began to throw overboard their Guns WaterCasks and Provision and by the Divine Providence found out one of the Leaks which they with much Difficulty stopt and by continual plying the Pump clear'd her of some Water But the incessant Labour fatigu'd us all so much that we began to despair again Yet Life being sweet every Person in the Vessel put forth their utmost Strength and labour'd hard all Night In the Break of the Morning we discover'd Land to the inexpressible Joy of the Sailors and what Wind we had pointed fair for the Place But our Joy had like to have been more fatal than the Storm for upon the first Notice of discovering Land every Person ran upon Deck like Madmen to be confirm'd  in the pleasing News never regarding the Pumps till we found the Vessel almost sinking under us Yet the Hope of Life inspir'd us with new Strength We work'd as hard as if the Sight of Shore had been a Day's Rest from Labour We had no Boat to land with therefore the Captain made a Signal of Distress and in less than an Hour we saw several Boats rowing towards us The Captain wisely consider'd if these Boats should come on Board every one would be for getting into them and leave the Vessel to sink for want of Working therefore he order'd TowRopes out that the approaching Boats might lend their Assistance that way Accordingly he acquainted the Sailors with his Intention and they with the Passengers approv'd of it The Boats when they came near us obey'd the Captain's Order and in two Hours we arriv'd safe in St  Aubin  's Bay a Harbour in the Island of  Jersey  The Island of  Jersey  in  Latin Caesarea  from  Julius Caesar  who gave it his own Name This Island and  Guernsey  are all that's left to  England  of their mighty  French  Conquests It appertains to  Hampshire  under the Jurisdiction of the Bishops of  Winchester  having for its ChurchGovernment a Dean and Twelve Ministers of the Gospel and for its Civil a Bailiff with Twelve of the chief Gentlemen of the Island call'd  Jurors  to administer Justice Besides these a Governor DeputyGovernor and Captains for their several Garrisons Yet the Complainant has still the Privilege to seek Redress from the King and Council in most Cases of Wrong or Difficulty  This Island is famous for Cider and Perry But its Staple Commodity is the famous  Jersey  Stockings so well known in  England    The Air is mild pleasant and not unwholsome The Soil rich and fruitful The very Hedges produce Apples and Pears without planting and the meanest Cottage can accommodate you with a Cup of Cider or Perry Their  French  Wheat is equal to any in  France  and their other Grain as good as any in  England  The Sea yields them Plenty of Fish and WildFowl innumerable  This Island by a strict Calculation contains Inhabitants and can raise in Defence of their Country not including their Garrisons upwards of Fighting Men It is above Miles round in Length and in Breadth The Inhabitants have to the last been in the Interest of the Crown of  England  and more than once the Retreat of their distrest Princes The Earl of  Richmond  afterwards  Henry the Seventh  first took Shelter here and from hence went over to  Britany  where he rais'd Forces sufficient to gain the Crown and punish  Richard the Third  for his bloody Reign  King  Charles  II made this Place the first Stage of his Exile during  Oliver  's Usurpation This Island was the last Place that surrender'd to the ParliamentForces Nor would the then Heroick Governor surrender  Elizabeth's Castle  till he receiv'd an Order for that Purpose from Prince  Charles  then residing at the  French  Court and in consideration of their many Services and unshaken Loyalty it has had many Privileges and Immunities granted by the Crown of  England  among the rest a Silver Mace sent 'em by King  Charles  II in the Year  Thro' their watchful Courage they have often repuls'd the  French  who have made many vain Attempts to graft this Scien to its ancient Stock The greatest Inconveniency is its want of Wood for Fuel instead of that they make use of a Sea Weed by the Inhabitants call'd  Vraù  The chief Town of the Island is call  St Hilaria  But the strongest Castle perhaps in his Majesty's Dominion is call'd  Elizabeth  compleated in that Queen's Reign built upon a Rock in the middle of the Ocean in the Mouth of Bay  St Aubin  's There is no Passage from the Island on Foot but at low Water nor then for above ten Men in Front Opposite near the Town of  St Aubin  's is another strong Tower surrounded by the Sea call'd  La Tour  or  The Tower  The Natives in general speak  French  as well as  English  and seem to be a courteous goodnatur'd affable People never better pleas'd than when conferring Obligations  The  noble Lord  Jermin  the then Governor came to the Harbour and invited me and my Company on Shore where we were entertain'd and accomodated as well as if we had been in  England  I shall decline mentioning those fine Qualities so well known in his Native  Country and only say he is ador'd in his Government the Inhabitants expressing the utmost Sorrow when it occurs to their Memory the Time must come for him to leave them  We were oblig'd to stay in this Place many Days against our Inclinations tho' the abovemention'd Nobleman did all in his Power to make the Time pass away as pleasantly as he could  When our Captain had taken out his Lading and Ballast to search for the Leaks he inform'd us 'twould be full Twenty Days before his Vessel would be in a Condition to put to Sea again This Notice made us all very uneasy but for my own Part I appear'd so very much dejected that the noble Governor out of his good Nature seem'd to sympathize with me in Sorrow I must own tho' Life was a Burden to me yet the Thoughts that my dear Uncle would imagine me no longer in this World and with Sorrow break his Heart added Pain to Pain and Grief to Grief The Consolations of my Friends were to no purpose tho' their friendly Sighs were mingled with mine  My Lord Governor perceiving the Uneasiness we express'd at our Stay in the Island sent to  Guernsey  a small Vessel to inquire whether there was any Ship preparing to sail for  England  She return'd the next Day and inform'd us a Ship from the  EastIndies  had put in there the late Storm and intended to set sail for  England  in two Days  This News reviv'd all my Company therefore we took Leave of the Governor with Thanks for his kind Usage imbark'd in the same Vessel that brought us the News tho' it was almost Evening and about Midnight arriv'd safely in St  Peter  's Harbour in the Island of  Guernsey  Guernsey  in  Latin Sarnia  lies nearer  England  a  Seven Leagues than  Jersey  It is very Stony and  nous yet there are fine Meadows and Pasture scatter'd up and down the whole Island It is famous for the best of Butter with which and Fish they drive a considerable Trade with  France St Peter  's is the chief Town very well inhabited  Situated upon a Rock about half a Mile in the Sea is  Cornet Castle  a Place of great Strength commanding all Parts of the Harbour which is generally the Residence of the Governor  In the Reign of King  Charles  II the Magazine of Powder was fir'd by Lightning in the Night when the Governor Lord  Hatton  his Lady Children and family were in their Beds The Governor was forc'd out of the Window in his Shirt thrown upon the Wall of the Castle several Paces from the Chamber when he lay and receiv'd no Hurt But his Lady and several of her MaidServants were kill'd by the Accident His Child an Infant was found the next Day in its Cradle under a Beam sleeping in Safety    Inquiring for the Captain of the Ship in the Harbour we found him at a Tavern but I was agreeably surpriz'd to find it Mr  Brooks  and his Ship the  Elizabeth  which he worthily sav'd for his Cousin Mr  Bridgford  that marry'd the Widow by a Wile He hardly knew me at first but when I came to his Remembrance he seem'd as much transported as if I had been his own Son He was confounded to find me with such Company in a Place so little expected but I soon let him into as much of my Story as I thought proper I must own said he when I receiv'd a Letter from the Governor yesterday desiring it as a Favour to give Passage to  England  to some Gentlemen Ladies and their Servants I did not intend to comply with it through the Inconveniency  it would put me to therefore gave Orders to set Sail early in the Morning knowing there was another Vessel now in the Harbour that sails for  England  in a few Days Neither could the Governor take it ill as he only directed his Letter to any Captain that shou'd chance to be in the Bay But if I had known my Passengers I wou'd have staid a Fortnight to oblige them and myself too I return'd him Thanks for his Civility and begg'd him to set Sail with the soonest Why then this Moment if you please answer'd the Captain  Upon the Instant he took Leave of his Company at the Tavern and tho' we were all very much fatigu'd went on Board his Ship where he gave immediate Orders for weighing Anchor and we were under Sail before Break of Day The Captain resign'd the great Cabbin to the two Ladies and accommodated every Body as well as he cou'd  I retir'd to mine hoping I shou'd meet with a little Repose being something calmer in my Mind knowing a few Days wou'd put a Period to my Misfortunes by Death for I had made a firm Resolution to punish the Perfidy of  Isabella  's Husband or fall by his  Hand or if I surviv'd to find a way to die beneath her Feet  These Thoughts lull'd me to taste the Pleasures of refreshing Sleep But my Senses were hardly lock'd up before I was awak'd with the Groans of a Person not far off in one of the Cabbins I arose up in my Bed and listen'd when I heard a Man cry For Heaven's sake take off my Irons that I may die at Liberty Another answer'd You know I dare not do it without the Captain's Order and he is now gone to sleep as soon as he is up I'll go and acquaint him Dear  Tom  reply'd the other take Pity on the Miseries I feel and step to him now I know he does not want Humanity or Goodnature and tho' I deserve not the least Favour from him yet when I am going to give an Account to Heaven for all my Crimes I am assur'd he will release me from these heavy Irons that even a Man in Health can hardly bear  I own I was touch'd with the Person's deep Sighs therefore call'd for my Servant put on my Gown and went to enquire into the melancholy Affair When I came to the Cabbin where the Wretch lay I was shock'd  to see a Man stretch'd at his Length upon a poor FlockBed on the Ground without any Covering meagre and pale with at least a hundred Pounds Weight of Irons about his Body to me he seem'd as if his last Moments were approaching Compassion took Possession of my Soul tho' I was convinc'd by his own Discourse he deserv'd but little  A Sailor that was walking upon Deck came up to me and judging by my Countenance that I seem'd to pity the unfortunate Wretch cry'd out What is he going let him go and be dn'd Friend said I let this poor Creature's Crimes be what they will I must own I think his Condition deserves Compassion therefore I shall be very much oblig'd to you if you will free him from his Irons that his Soul may take its Flight with the more Tranquillity Sir reply'd the Sailor if you were acquainted with that Rogue's wicked Heart you would believe no Punishment in this or the next World could be bad enough for him O Sir cry'd the unfortunate Wretch I deserve every thing that Man says but I have heartily repented of all the ill Actions I have committed and only beg to die without this Load upon my Body Some of these Irons have eat my Flesh from  the Bones and as I wear the Form of a Man don't let me be treated in my Dying Moments worse than a mad Beast ty'd to the Stake  I us'd so many Persuasions with the Rhetorick of a Guinea to the Person that seem'd to have the Guard of him that he was going to awake the Captain and acquaint him with the poor Wretch's Condition and my Request to have him releas'd from his Fetters but the Captain that Moment came out of his Cabbin being disturb'd with our Conversation and at my Intreaty order'd his Irons to be taken off As soon as he was freed from them he gave me Thanks for the Service I had done him and rising slowly from his Bed whereon he lay seiz'd upon some of the Irons he was releas'd from and struck the Sailor that was talking to me before the Captain came out of his Cabbin with such Violence that we all believ'd he was kill'd then made a Blow at the Captain which he happily avoided by starting aside but perceiving the Sailors running from all Parts of the Ship to seize him he threw himself overboard maugre all they could do to prevent him crying he had in some measure satisfy'd his Revenge and was never seen more  All this was done so suddenly that I stood quite confounded imagining I was in a Dream But when we began to recollect ourselves we went to see if the Sailor was alive or dead We took him up and I must own I was very well pleas'd to find he was only stunn'd with the Blow In a little time he came to his Senses and the first Words he spoke were Gd Dn him for a Son of a Bh who wou'd have thought he had so much Strength left But I'll prevent him giving another Blow Upon saying this he ran up and down the Deck with his Cutlass drawn he being one of the Centries at the great Cabbin Door to seek for him to make an end of him but when he was inform'd of his rash Catastrophe he seem'd to be uneasy that he had not the killing of him with his own Hand  By this time my Brother  Clerimont  and the Ladies were alarm'd and came about us to know the Cause of the Disturbance I told 'em 'twas the first time I ever found Compassion a dangerous Virtue We begg'd of the Captain to let us into the Affair He told us at Dinner it shou'd be our Desert instead of Fruit While this Combustion happen'd the Man at the Helm had disregarded  the Steerage so that the Sails clap'd to the Masts and the Ship staid some time but even this seem'd the Providence of Heaven for had we continu'd our Course it being a very hazy Morning we shou'd have run upon the Shallows of the  Great Sark  The  Great Sark  is a small Island about three Leagues from  Guernsey  It formerly belong'd to the  French  but the  English  took it from them by Stratagem There is but one small Town and three or four little Villages on the whole Island It was given by the Crown to the  Carteret  Family who are Lords of  Sark      Thank Heaven said the Captain this Wretch after endeavouring to frustrate our Voyage by the most wicked Designs could ever enter the Mind of Man seems intended by Providence to be the Means of saving us and like  Jonah  in the Ship of  Joppa  now he has abandon'd our Vessel we shall have all Dangers cease  When the Ship had her true Way again the Captain order'd the Wretches Bedding and Cloaths to be examin'd and thrown overboard In searching the Pockets of an old pair of Breeches they found a written Paper with a Pencil which he read to the Company as follows  IF Heaven forsakes me Hell will receive me with open Arms I have endeavour'd to repent but still find my Mind bent on Revenge and I will hazard my Body and Soul to accomplish it If ever I can by any cunning Method get rid of my Irons I will if I have Strength be the Death of Captain  Brooks Tom Burgess Tom Wingfield Dick Hammond  and  Robin Norton  for using me so ill I write this to leave behind that if I should die in my Confinement those Villains may know what I intended to do But if I fail of my intended Purpose it will grieve me in my State of Perdition  This terrible Declaration made me very much repent my Goodnature I could hardly think there had been such a wicked Villain in the World  After Dinner we begg'd Captain  Brooks  to relate the History of this Wretch which he did in the following manner  Sir said he directing his Discourse to me having some small Knowledge of him you know my Cousin  Bridgford  the old Acquaintance of your good Uncle made me Captain of the  Elizabeth  in consideration of some  Services he was pleas'd to own I did him This Wretch who is gone to the other World to answer for his Crimes in this through my Intreaty was made chief Mate and behav'd honestly as such during our TradingVoyage to the  Indies  In our Return near the Latitude of  St Helena  where we were bound for some Refreshment in the middle of a dark Night we heard some Guns fir'd that seem'd to us as if some Vessel was in Distress I order'd our Ship to steer the Course from whence the Fire came but in an Hour afterwards we heard such a terrible Report that we all concluded the unfortunate Vessel was blown into the Air However I kept on my Course to see if I cou'd assist any of the unfortunate Wretches that no doubt had either got into their Boat or had thrown themselves into the Water to avoid the Flames hanging out Lights about several Parts of my Ship that they might see where to come for Succour  In less than an Hour more some of our Crew cou'd perceive a Boat rowing towards us full of Men As soon as they came up with us they begg'd for Heaven's sake to be taken on Board I who had no other Intention mov'd by Compassion considering  it might have been our own Case invited 'em kindly on Board When they were a little recover'd from their Fright they inform'd me they belong'd to a Ship bound for  Cork  in  Ireland  from the Coast of  Coromandel  and had by a violent Storm been drove out of their Course that in the beginning of the Night a Fire broke out in the GunRoom burning with such Fury that all their Endeavours to extinguish it prov'd fruitless therefore they hoisted out their LongBoat and with one Barrel of Water and two Casks of Bisket abandon'd their Ship and in half an Hour after they left it they saw it blow up several Pieces of the Vessel falling within twenty Yards of 'em  There were seventeen Men in the Boat their Master being one of them whose Name was  Cox  but observing he was very much wounded in the Head I order'd our Surgeon to dress him immediately who inform'd me his Skull was fractur'd and he thought it seem'd to be a Blow with a Cutlass But the Sailors that came with him in the Boat told us he arose up hastily at the first Noise about the Fire and hurrying down the Ladder that goes under Deck fell with his Head on the Edge of a Bucket When he came  to his Senses for the Pain of Dressing had flung him into a Swoon he told us the same Story Yet still the Surgeon insisted it cou'd be no such thing and began to instil I know not what Notions into my Mind that these Men might be Villains I own he a little stagger'd my Faith at first but when I consider'd their Condition I thought it impossible However I determin'd to leave 'em all at  St Helena  because indeed there were too many Mouths for me to maintain in our Voyage for  England  I gave 'em all the Refreshment my Ship cou'd afford and they return'd me Thanks in so sincere a manner that quite obliterated those Notions the Surgeon had of them The Captain I put in my own Cabbin using him as I thought an honest unfortunate Man in his Condition deserv'd and such as I should have been pleas'd to meet with upon the like unfortunate Accident  In two Days after this we arriv'd safe at  St Helena  The Island of  St Helena  was discover'd upon  St Helen  's Day in the Year by  John de Nova  a  Portuguese  it is now in the Possession of the  English  It is  st surrounded with Rocks and reckon'd the farthest Island from the Continent of any in the known world It is about Miles in compass and though Mountainous is very fruitful There are four very pleasant Vallies and as many Springs of good Water all sorts of Poultry Sallading Roots and Fruits as well as Hogs Flesh are so cheap that it is almost a Miracle when we consider the many  EastIndia  Ships that touch there every Year It is very well inhabited but they dwell in the Vallies except when the Ships arrive when they repair to the Fort with their Provisions for the Ships every Trader having a Warehouse in the Town where they barter with the Sailors for Necessaries seldom any Money passing between them When the Ships are gone the Planters retire to their Houses in the Vallies that are delightfully situated breathing a healthful Air and subjected to few Diseases They are govern'd by the same Laws as in  England    where I put all the unfortunate  Sailors on Shore with this Reason that my Ship was too deep laden to be incumber'd with so many superfluous Men  I went to wait on the Governor on Shore and contracted with him for what fresh Provisions I wanted intending to set Sail in eight Days but the Governor advis'd me to stay longer assuring me that several Ships would arrive before that Time that would accompany me in our Voyage home On that Account I resolv'd to take his Advice I sent on Board for some Necessaries because I intended to take a Lodging in the Valley for a  Fortnight to enjoy the Air of the Country But my Surgeon being inform'd of my Intention came with my Servant in the Boat with the Things I had sent for importuning me so strongly not to lie out of the Ship tha  I return'd on Board with him purely to make him easy for I must own his Apprehensions did not give me the least Inquietude  Homes  the Name of the Wretch that is so lately gone to Perdition complain'd he was very much troubled with the Scurvy therefore intreated the Favour of going on Shore for a few Days I cou'd not refuse him neither had I any Apprehension of an ill Design from him having ever behav'd in the Voyage like a downright honest Man entirely in our Owner's Interest We staid twenty Days in the Harbour without the Appearance of any Ship from the East therefore I made a Resolution of pursuing our intended Voyage if no Vessel arriv'd to bear us company in four Days Accordingly I gave Notice to the Governor of my Intention as usual that the Inhabitants if they had any Demands might be satisfy'd before we set Sail  I went to rest that Night with a Tremor upon my Spirits and an unaccountable Melancholy  that seem'd a foreboding ill Omen About Midnight the Surgeon came into my Cabbin and awak'd me with a very great Surprize in his Countenance His Looks I own very much alarm'd me What's the matter with you Mr  Westwood  said I that's the Name of my Surgeon you seem in some Disorder Sir reply'd Mr  Westwood  here's a Man has swam from Shore in the middle of a stormy Night to give you Notice of approaching Danger and I must own I have been in such a continual Lowness of Spirits that I am well assur'd some ill Designs are hatching against our Welfare therefore pray rise and hear what the Person has to say for he will not communicate it to any one but yourself I arose upon the Instant and desired him to bring in the Man He brought him into the Cabbin naked as he was As soon as I saw him I knew him for one of the Persons that came to us in the Boat Sir said he I have something to inform you of that requires your private Ear My Friend I reply'd this Gentleman is one whom I can entirely trust therefore what you have to communicate to me he may hear If so Sir reply'd the Man I shall proceed However Sir said I I beg the Favour  since you came naked for my Service as I suppose that you will put on this Nightgown Sir return'd the Man I'll accept of your Favour tho' I feel nothing of the Inclemency of the Weather because my Concern for you has fill'd up all my Thoughts I therefore will proceed to tell you what I know that you may be prepar'd for the Event Mr  Homes  your chief Mate has form'd the blackest Design that cou'd ever enter into the Soul of the most Profligate In less than two Hours he will seize your Ship and put to Death You and Mr  Westwood  with every Sailor that will not come into his black Design I own myself one of the Confederates but with no other Motive than to use my utmost Endeavours to prevent it if Heaven will permit Therefore acquaint your Men with the Danger approaching arm 'em immediately and prevent 'em if possible at least sell your Lives like Men that have deserv'd a better Fate I was eager to enquire about this Affair but the Man told me I had no Time to lose first arm your Men said he and when you are in Readiness to receive them I'll acquaint you with the Conspiracy against you  I then order'd the Watch to awake those that were gone to Rest and when they were all upon Deck with their Arms in their Hands I call'd the Man and desired he would communicate the Story to the whole Crew which consisted of Fiftyfour Men We made a Circle round him upon the QuarterDeck and he began as follows  Gentlemen you all know me I believe to be one of those Men whom the Humanity of your Captain sav'd from imminent Death therefore I think he has a Right to my Life and Fortune Every Person beside myself that his Compassion gave Means of Life to have deserv'd the Halter more than once Their Number was much greater their Crew consisting of Men when they set out from the Coast of  Guiney  but the Day before the Night you sav'd us from the devouring Waves we had a terrible Engagement with a  Dutch  Man of War in which we lost above half our Men  Homes  the Captain mistaking her for an  Indian  Trader that we had Advice of from the  Guiney  Coast Our Ship taking Fire by what Accident I know not the  Dutch  Man of War's Men that had boarded us and wou'd have certainly  taken us left us fearing as we suppos'd they might suffer by us if we blew up and sail'd away The Fire was so sudden that we had but a small time to hoist out our Longboat The Captain and sixteen of us got into it but many other of the Wretches endeavouring to get in were barbarously murder'd by the other Sailors We row'd as fast as we cou'd from the burning Ship but the Cries of the Wretches we left behind methinks are still in my Ears It was no small Joy to us when we perceiv'd your Lights hung out But the Wretch the Captain tho' so dangerously wounded declar'd if he thought he shou'd have met with a Ship so soon he wou'd have taken all the Men he cou'd that he might have been able to have taken the Ship that was coming to his Rescue But since it is as it is said he we must make the best of a bad Market and wait for some Opportunity to get another Ship Then we consulted how to impose on you with a false Story and trump'd up That they told you for the Wound the Captain has upon his Head was given by a  Dutchman  in the Fight Pray said the Surgeon how came you among such a Crew of Villains Why Sir I'll tell you reply'd  the Man I belong'd to a Coast Sloop in the River of  Gambo  where all my Crew were murder'd but one by the Negroes who had inviegled them up into the Country The poor Man that made his Escape had but just time to tell me the fatal News ere Death overtook him from the Wounds he had receiv'd I had scarce time to cut my Cable and drive out to Sea favour'd by the Wind and Tide of Ebb when I perceiv'd about twenty Boats coming down the River in order to seize my Sloop and no doubt to make me partake of the same Fate with my unfortunate Men which I certainly should have done for they would have overtaken me in a couple of Hours if both they and I had not perceiv'd a Ship in the  Offin  which prov'd to be this Wretch and his Crew I made them a Signal of my Distress which they perceiving made up to me and took me on Board but the Negroes left their Pursuit as soon as ever they discover'd the Ship  I soon found to my Sorrow what Company I was got into but it was to no Purpose to complain for the Captain seiz'd my Vessel took out every thing that seem'd useful and sunk her with this Pretence He  fear'd his Men might take it into their Heads to leave him and set up for themselves tho' I must own he promis'd to pay me for my Cargo and give me my Liberty the first Opportunity but those were but Words and what I verily believe he never intended to perform  I often observ'd your Mate during the time we were sailing to this Island after you kindly took us in caballing privately with our Captain and several of our Men but had no Notion of their wicked Intention to seize your Ship till Yesterday Morning being at a Planter's in the  South Valley  where I was treated with some Palm Wine and not being us'd to drink in a Morning it got into my Head finding myself inclin'd to sleep I laid myself down under a Hedge but before I had clos'd my Eyes I was interrupted by the Voices of our Captain and your Mate By their Discourse I found out their black Design and their Business to that Plantation was to communicate the Affair to me but I understood if I did not come into it it was their Intention to murder me I immediately arose from the Place full of unquiet Thoughts which brought me out of my drunken Fit I took care to get as far from  the Hedge as I cou'd that they might not suspect I had overheard 'em It was a full Quarter of an Hour before they found me out and in that time I had compos'd myself as well as I cou'd When they came up with me they ask'd me if I wou'd take a Walk to the next Plantation where two of them lodg'd I answer'd very willingly Yes  When we came to the Bridge that was built over the River they stop'd and open'd the whole Affair to me I made no Hesitation but enter'd into their Design with a seeming Joy for if I had not I don't doubt but it was their Intention to throw me into the River Nay their very Looks declar'd as much  At Three o' Clock this Morning your Mate with the rest are to board you arm'd every Man with a Cutlass and two Brace of Pistols secure the Watch and kill every one that will not take part in their villainous Undertaking then weigh Anchor and sail for the  Bermudas  where they will dispose of the Cargo and then set out upon the Pirating account  When he had finish'd his short but terrible Relation the Sailors cry'd out they  wou'd have the Longboat and meet them with such a Reception that shou'd make 'em repent their Undertaking But the Surgeon and I persuaded them it would be better and safer to counterwork them We therefore agreed to charge all our Guns with MusketBall and if they offer'd to come on when we order'd them to return the Sailors shou'd fire upon 'em However eight of my Men prevail'd upon me to have the Longboat ready to pursue them and bring 'em Prisoners in order to be punish'd for their treacherous Intention  In short we provided against every thing and in half an Hour after we were prepar'd to receive 'em we heard their Oars in the Water We let 'em come within three Ships Length of us and then call'd to 'em to proceed no farther As they I believe did not expect to be hinder'd in their Boarding us they lay upon their Oars and ask'd me what I was afraid of  Homes  was the chief Speaker who I soon gave to understand I knew his vile Intention If it be so he cry'd out we have no Time to dally Come my Lads we'll soon see who are to be Masters they or we Upon that they row'd towards us with all their Strength with their Cutlasses drawn  and Pistols in their Hands But before they reach'd us we fir'd upon 'em with our Double and Round which kill'd four of their Number and wounded several Their Confusion was so great at this unexpected Reception that they row'd ahead of us where our Guns cou'd not bear upon them While I was ordering my Men upon the Forecastle to fire upon them I perceiv'd the Ship driving for that Wretch  Homes  had cut my Cable  The Tide by good Fortune was ebbing for had it been Tide of Flood we must have drove upon the Rocks before we cou'd have cast another Anchor In the Confusion the Boat row'd to board us but my Men fir'd upon them once more in the same manner as at first which put 'em in much Disorder Our Ship still driving I order'd 'em to cast Anchor However they took so much Time in doing it that we were a Quarter of a League from the Pirates before the Anchor fell In the mean time our Longboat with the eight Men got up to the Pirates and a desperate Engagement follow'd What troubled me was that I cou'd not assist 'em for if I had fir'd my Guns with Ball which cou'd easily reach 'em I might have destroy'd my Friends with my Enemies My Men  were swearing cursing and banning at this unforeseen Accident nay some of 'em were for stripping with an Intention to swim naked to help 'em never once considering the Tide of Ebb wou'd prevent 'em But what was the more extraordinary in this Confusion not one of us for some time thought of our Yawl upon the Booms But as soon as I mention'd it they got it into the Water in a Moment threw themselves into it with so much Precipitation that their Haste had almost overset it and row'd away with so much Strength that they soon got up to the Assistance of their Comrades in good time for two of 'em were kill'd and the other six very much wounded Their Firing we observ'd had ceas'd some time having discharg'd all their FireArms and if the Yawl had not arriv'd as it did the other six of my Men had certainly been cut to pieces but this Reinforcement soon put an end to the Fight by the Death of all the Pirates but two and  Homes  who were very much wounded  When they were brought on Board my Men were for tearing them to pieces especially  Homes  but I pacify'd them a little by telling 'em they shou'd be reserv'd for the Punishment due to their Crimes when we arriv'd in  England    My Surgeon dress'd their Wounds and by good Fortune all my own Men recover'd but the two Pirates dy'd in our Voyage home The vile Wretch  Homes  while his Hurts were healing us'd to utter such blasphemous Imprecations that shock'd all the Crew When he was fully recover'd I order'd him to be manacled leaving his Legs at Liberty with two Men to guard him He often attempted to throw himself overboard and was as often prevented  About a Month ago as he was walking upon Deck with his two Guards he observ'd Mr  Mullart  the Person that swam on Board to give us Notice of their Design standing upon the Gunnel of the Ship to look at a dead Whale that was floating near us He goes up to him unobserv'd and push'd him into the Sea As it fell out the Sea was very calm tho' we had Wind enough to fill our Sails otherwise tho' a good Swimmer he might have perish'd We brought to with all the Celerity imaginable and not without some Difficulty sav'd him  One of the Sailors upbraiding him for the Cruelty of the Action he struck him in the Face broke his Jaw and beat out three of his Teeth with his HandCuffs I seeing  this vile Proceeding order'd him to be seiz'd and fetter'd but it was with much Difficulty for he laid about him with such Agility and Vigor that a Carpenter was oblig'd to knock him down with a HandSpike When he came to himself for the Blow had stunn'd him for some time he swore he was sorry for nothing but that  Mullart  was not gone to Hell by Water  As I was giving Orders how he shou'd be us'd for the future he grinn'd at me gave me several hearty Curses and spit in my Face which I own provok'd me to strike him He was then laid in the manner you saw him this Morning  About a Week ago he began to think of his Crimes and seem'd so penitent that I order'd his Irons to be taken off had him bath'd shifted and clean'd When his Cloaths were on again Mr  Mullart  being upon Deck he very submissively approach'd him telling him he was very sorry for what he had done to him but as soon as ever he got within his Reach he flew upon him got him down and in his Fury wou'd have strangled him if if he had not been taken away by main Force  We all thought it high time to make him as secure as possible for such an infernal Wretch never more cou'd deserve Compassion For these last three Days his Centries have thought him near his Death but it was only his Artifice to get clear once more that he might do more Mischief in his last Moments  When Mr  Brooks  had ended his Story we all thought it impossible Nature should furnish out such a Villain And yet said the Captain this Wretch has made more than one Voyage with me and ever seem'd a Man of Integrity an open and free Countenance that discover'd no Rancour or Baseness in it But as  Shakespear  says  There's no Art to find the Mind's Construction in the Face    We sail'd on with a favourable Gale bending our Course for the  Bristol  Channel where Captain  Brooks  was bound On the fourth Day after our leaving  Guernsey  we discover'd the chalky Cliffs of our Native Country which gave a sudden Alteration to the Features of every one of the Company all but myself wore a pleasing Contentment on their Countenances but for my own part my Mind felt so many Vicissitudes that the wisest  Physiognomist I believe wou'd have been puzzled to have known my Thoughts but no Wonder for I knew 'em not myself All the Passions of Love Duty Hatred Jealousy Revenge and Death mix'd in such a general Tumult that all within was wild Anarchy and Uproar The Thoughts of seeing my Native Country which fill'd every one else with the utmost Transports gave me no other Satisfaction than the Hopes of Death to put an end to Thought and all my devouring Sorrows  In two Days more we came to an Anchor near the LandingPlace of the Island of  Lundy  The Island of  Lundy  is an Island five Miles long and two broad surrounded with Rocks in the middle of the  Severn  Sea near the Coast of  Cornwall  thinly inhabited and altho' seated in the Salt Ocean yet there are many Springs of excellent FreshWater and prodigiously stock'd with WildFowl  where we found a small Vessel bound for  Monmouth  As that Place was but a Day's Journey from most of our Dwellings we took Leave of Captain  Brooks  and embark'd in that Vessel for  Monmouth  The Captain parted from us with very great Regret but with a Promise to see us in a few Days after  his Arrival at  Bristol  We weigh'd Anchor together and kept Company till we arriv'd at the Mouth of the  Avon  that leads to  Bristol  and then parted after receiving several Guns from the  Elizabeth  by way of Salute We arriv'd that Night at  Chepstow  upon the River  Wye  where all the Company desir'd to be set on Shore for they were very much fatigu'd particularly the Ladies  As soon as ever we landed I sent one of my Servants to acquaint my Uncle with my Arrival and of my Intentions to wait on him in three Days at the farthest with Orders to my Servant to meet me at  Monmouth  the next Day where we arriv'd by Noon I found my Servant waiting for me who inform'd me that my Uncle and Mrs  Betty  had been gone to  London  four Days before to wait my Arrival there I own I was both griev'd and pleas'd griev'd that I should not see my dear Uncle so soon as I expected and pleas'd to know that he had receiv'd my Letters and had Strength and Health enough to travel  Now Despair with all its black Train of Horrors fully possess'd my Soul yet gave me Light enough to see I shou'd never possess my dear  Isabella  All Hopes were banish'd  and the nearer I drew to the Residence of my adorable Fair One the farther I drew from all Thoughts of Happiness What Pains what Miseries what Anxieties and what inexpressible Tortures was my broken Heart torn with Treading upon the same Earth and breathing the same Air with my dear Love for ever debarr'd my Arms only added to my various Torments  I went to Rest but alas the Fatigues of the Sea the Weakness of my Body and the want of Sleep were overbalanc'd by the Tortures of my Mind  I arose in the Morning without ever closing my Eyes which had made such an Alteration in my Countenance that I was hardly known by my Friends They were too well acquainted with the Cause yet notwithstanding endeavour'd to comfort me But alas they might as well have stopt the Fury of a Tempest or the swiftest Current in its rapid Course as give Advice to heal my wounded Soul  My Friend was inconsolable well knowing my Ruin was the Work of his unlucky forming and maugre my ill Fate I was compell'd to smother my Heartbreaking Sorrows in order to comfort him who now  was dearer to me than any thing on Earth since I had lost all Hopes of my Divine  Isabella    The Tortures of my Mind prey'd so violently on my Body that I was once more hurry'd to the dark Confines of Death A special Messenger was sent to my Uncle at  London  to inform him of my unhappy State and my newconverted dear Friend wou'd accompany him maugre all my Intreaties to the contrary I was so very weak it was dangerous to remove me to my Uncle's tho' but a short Day's Journey from  Monmouth  As I thought my last Moments approaching I took a Resolution of writing the following Letter to  Isabella    WHAT envious Stars divine  Isabella  have wrought this Murder on my Love But why do I 'tax the Stars when it was the Work of false Malice and Treachery You I know thro' the Excellency of your Soul will love the Man you have given your Hand to and bury all your Vows to me in Oblivion pray Heaven for your Peace of Mind you may This is I firmly believe the last Pen I shall ever take in Hand The Hours I have to live I hope will not be many since I have lost all in  this World I wish'd to live for Wilt thou when I am dead water my Grave with one pitying Tear and lament my unhappy Destiny I have no Wish now remaining but that if it was possible thou wert present to close the Eyes of the Heartbroken unhappy  VAUGHAN  P S  I have sent you a few Trifles that I hope you will accept since they were purchas'd in my unfortunate Travels for you It can be no Breach of Duty to your happy Husband sure to look upon 'em sometimes Oh how happy shou'd I have been if I had never imbark'd from my Native Country But 'tis Heaven's high Will it shou'd be so and I wish I cou'd not complain it wou'd have been too great a Happiness to have been bless'd with thee I cou'd dwell for ever on this melancholy Theme but my Weakness obliges me to leave off and gives me just Strength enough to say  Farewell for ever  My Spirits with my Tears and Sighs had left me and it was some time ere I had Strength enough to fold the Letter and direct it  To the Divine  Isabella  I order'd my Servant that had accompany'd me in my Travels to find her out and if it was possible to give it into her own Hands Observe said I her Countenance tell her the unhappy Condition of thy Master I will if it be possible keep Life till thy Return that I may have the Pleasure in Dying to hear she has dropt a Tear for all my Misfortunes He promis'd to execute his Commission with the utmost Diligence  The next Day he return'd with a dejected Countenance and inform'd me that  Isabella  her Mother and Aunt had been gone some Days from their House but none of the Servants cou'd inform him whither He also inquir'd of the Neighbourhood but to as little Purpose  This struck me into the last Depth of Despair insomuch that I resolv'd to put a Period to my Life I refus'd all Physic Nourishment and Rest and despis'd the Intreaties of my Brother and his Friends I inform'd 'em no one upon Earth not my dear Uncle shou'd destroy my Resolution of Dying if he arriv'd before I expir'd They press'd me with their Tears and Sighs but all in vain Till at last they prevail'd upon me to hear the Prayers of a worthy Clergyman  who so effectually cur'd me of Despair by laying before me the neverforgiven Sin of SelfMurder that I submitted to all their Desires The Physicians prescrib'd I took their Medicines receiv'd what they intended for Nourishment and address'd myself to Sleep yet all to no purpose Death glar'd me full in the Face tho' all his Terrors cou'd not fright me I look'd upon him as the only Cure for a broken Heart The Conversation with my good Priest had I thank Heaven settled my Conscience I expected Death's Approach as that of my best Friend and hop'd to see him before my Uncle that I might not be a living Witness to all his Heartrending Griefs They gave me Medicines to make me sleep but alas the Agonies I felt in what the Apothecaries call  Composing Draughts  and that seem to lock up the Senses to soft Slumber are hardly to be express'd The Mind was still awake tho' my Body seemingly was at rest and Fancy represented to me my hard Fortune with redoubled Terrors  I was ten Days in this languishing deplorable Condition fluctuating between Death and Life when News was brought me of my Uncle's Arrival Tho' I wish'd to sink to the silent Grave for the Reason I just now mention'd  yet my Heart felt some Gleam of Pleasure that he was come to close my Eyes and bless me ere I died When my Uncle enter'd the Room where I lay he ran to me tenderly embrac'd me and wept over me O Heaven said he is this the Joy I propos'd to myself in thy precious Conversation No my dear Boy thou shalt not leave me Forget  Isabella  and turn thy Eyes to another Beauty I have brought with me that loves thee for thy Virtue and thy Merit and if that can have any effect upon thee she is the very Picture of thy lost  Isabella  Since she is now another's turn thy Eyes upon this Lady and let her Charms cure those Wounds the other gave Alas Sir said I Fate is not to be controll'd and my Passion is as irrevocable Wilt thou not live reply'd my Uncle to comfort my feeble Age who have no other Joy in Life but thee I have been industrious to provide this Match for thee and contrary to the Rules of the Sex have prevail'd upon her to accompany me Do not let thy hopeless Passion make thee forget good Manners Thy Slights will break her Heart Never poor Wretch had such a Conflict in his Soul I thought it wou'd be the highest Ingratitude not to see a poor young Lady that had given  me her Heart without seeing me After much Argument I told my Uncle if he pleas'd he might bring the Lady to see what a Wretch she had plac'd her unhappy Love upon and all the Satisfaction I cou'd give her was to expire before her for I told my Uncle I found Death approaching  He immediately went out and return'd with my Friend who led a Lady by the Hand I then call'd to mind weak as I was he had often told me of a beautiful Sister of his that he wish'd I cou'd love that he might make me some Recompence for the Loss he caus'd of my  Isabella  And I out of good Manners seldom said any thing against it  Madam said I your good Brother has brought you to see a Wretch tho' young old in Misfortunes one who is flying to the Grave to seek a Refuge from 'em one who What interrupted the Lady and has my dear  Vaughan  in reality forgot his  Isabella  The Chamber having but little Light in it I could not distinguish the Features of my  Isabella  but I knew full well that soft Voice whose Tone was ever in my Ears It had such an Effect upon me that I cou'd only pronounce her dear Name then sunk down speechless in my Bed It was a full  half Hour ere they cou'd restore me to Sense But when I saw the dear Image tenderly weeping over me that I ever carry'd in my Heart I cou'd not help crying out Am I awake or do I dream of such imaginary Bliss Art thou indeed my  Isabella  Mine really mine and not wedded to that Wretch who wou'd rob me of all my Soul can love in this World I am thine reply'd the charming  Isabella  ever will be thine nor ever was or ever will be any others' I have my Mother's my Aunt's and thy good Uncle's Consent to join our Hands as well as Hearts together and they are here to ratify what I say Upon this the Mother and Aunt enter'd who tenderly embrac'd me calling me their dear Son and Nephew  These tender Transports were too strong for my weak Frame and Joy was near doing what my Griefs wou'd soon have done My Speech forsook me and every one about me thought I was gone for ever It was many Hours before I was brought to Life and when I recover'd I found my dear  Isabella  almost in the same Condition But kind Heaven that is watchful over those that tread in the Paths of Goodness in a few Days recover'd us to taste the Bliss of happy virtuous  Love in our chaste Conversation It was some time before I had Leisure to enquire concerning my unbounded Joy when my Friend inform'd me of it in this manner  When I saw you my dear  Vaughan  plung'd in Sorrow by my means I had often Thoughts of putting an end to my wretched Life But reflecting it wou'd be a nobler piece of Justice to punish the Villain that was the Cause of all our Misfortunes I was resolv'd to seek him out to take away his Life or give up mine to pay for the Injustice I had done you thro' his Wiles I found a fitting Pretence to leave you when you suppos'd I was going with your Servant to  London  in order to acquaint your good Uncle with our miserable State But I parted with the Messenger the Morning we set out giving him Directions to call upon me in his Return with your Uncle to receive Advice from me if Fate had ordain'd I shou'd not fall in the Attempt or if they heard no News of me to conclude I was no longer in this World When I came within a few Miles of the Residence of  Isabella  a violent Storm arose which made me take Shelter in a neighbouring Village But guess my Surprize when I saw a Coach and  Six stop at the Church Door which by the Liveries I knew belong'd to that vile Man Sir  Eustace  I formerly call'd Friend The Sight at first almost took away my Senses but recollecting my scatter'd Reason I set my self to observe all Passages The Wretch came out dress'd like a foppish Bridegroom leading the lovely  Isabella  trembling pale and wan follow'd by the Mother and Aunt I enquir'd of a Standerby if he knew that Gentleman and the Ladies He answer'd No but that they came to be marry'd at their Town for more Privacy Hope then began to revive in my Soul for I was resolv'd to put a Stop to the Wedding or lose my Life  I follow'd 'em into the Church where as soon as Sir  Eustace  saw me he cry'd out in a Transport of Joy Fortune I thank thee thou hast sent the only Friend I have in the World to be Witness of my Joy Upon that he come forward with open Arms to embrace me Hold said I pushing him from me I abhor all Friendship with a Villain and kind Heaven has sent me at this happy Moment to prevent thy imposing upon this betray'd young Lady and her Relations thro' thy Villainy and my mistaken Folly  But know the Hand of Heaven by me shall punish thee for all thy Villainies He stood like one aghast while I had time to go up to the young Lady Madam said I if you ever did love the unhappy  Vaughan  love him still for he is innocent and ever was so but betray'd by that Wretch who is more eminent in Vice than Title  The lovely  Isabella  I thought seem'd to listen with an eager Transport in her Eyes at what I declar'd I gave her my Hand and led her out of the Church follow'd by the Parson who seem'd in the utmost Amazement at this wonderful Proceeding But I told him his Disappointment shou'd be no Loss to him for I wou'd pay him as well as if he had finish'd the Marriage For Heaven's sake Sir reply'd the Parson don't imagine I am such a mercenary Wretch to think of the Loss of what I might expect for doing the holy Office I am ordain'd to by Heaven and my Superiors No I am I own very much surpriz'd at such an Adventure that never happen'd to me before or any one of my holy Function that I ever heard of Yet I am convinc'd there is something very extraordinary in your Proceeding and I own I think by your Appearance and the Confusion of  the other Gentleman you are in the Right I took a Distaste against him the first time I saw him when he came to me about the Licence What a brave Trade you would have Doctor said he if you cou'd grant a Licence to undo what you have done this way in your Time Ah how happy should we young Fellows think ourselves if such a Thing cou'd be brought about But when I reprimanded him for his ludicrous manner of speaking he cry'd Pr'ythee old  Tackum  don't be so musty I warrant you have had many a Wench in your Time I own I was so very much offended with his ridiculous Jests that I told him the Lady he was going to marry I fear'd wou'd have but an indifferent Time with him and if I had the Happiness of her Acquaintance I shou'd think it my Duty to inform her of the Poorness of his Imaginations When he found I was a little scandaliz'd with his mean Notions of Marriage he began to excuse himself and beg my Pardon  I forgot to tell you as I led  Isabella  out of the Church my false Friend stood like one thunderstruck in his Amazement Villain said I as I pass'd him if thou think'st I have injur'd thee in the Discovery I shall make to  this Lady and her Relations thou know'st where I may be found in a few Days where I will be ready to chastise thy Persidy to this Lady and the Infamy thou hast thrown on me He gave me no manner of Answer but let me pass on without Interruption  When we came to the Parson's House I related not without blushing the base and infamous Contrivance between Sir  Eustace  and me my Repentance and the terrible Effects it had on you also the History of your Brother and the fair  Fatima  with  Clerimont  and his Lady as I had learnt 'em from your own Relations The charming  Isabella  shed a Torrent of Tears at the Repetition of all your Sufferings It was easily seen she lov'd you with an unbounded Passion The Mother and Aunt seem'd as much transported with Joy as the fair  Isabella  How shall I punish myself cry'd the Fair One for so easily believing my dear  Vaughan  false His good Uncle too what shall we say to him to excuse our ill Treatment I comforted 'em by telling 'em the Proofs were too artful and plain to be doubted for Truths In short never were any Persons elevated from dismal Sorrow to the extremest Pitch of Pleasure as these Ladies and myself were rais'd to But that Joy  was temper'd with Fears when I inform'd 'em of your cruel Indisposition and Sorrows We resolv'd to set out as soon as possible to the Place appointed to meet your Uncle and if we found him not there immediately to repair to  Monmouth  but upon Enquiry we cou'd get no Coach to carry the Ladies therefore a Servant was order'd to  Isabella  's Mother's for hers  While we were mingling our Tears Hopes Sorrows and Joys together the Clark came to inform me the Gentleman beg'd the Favour of speaking one Word with me in the Churchyard I did not doubt but he had muster'd up Courage enough to call for Satisfaction for his suppos'd Injury I therefore took my Sword and maugre the Intreaties of  Isabella  her Mother and Aunt went to meet him When I came near enough to him to be heard I told him I was ready to repair the Injuries I had done him with my Sword if he had Spirit enough to require it No Sir said he I have had time enough to recollect myself and find I have been to blame in my Conduct but notwithstanding I find Love like Fate is not to be controll'd therefore I conjure you by our former Friendship to forget what is past and assist me honestly to gain the fair  Isabella  I love her more than Life and wou'd even part with it to gain her Heart and your Forgiveness Hearing him talk so reasonably I began to lose some part of my Resentment but yet laid before him the Impossibility of his ever gaining his Desires We argued some time and our Discourse had insensibly led us out of the Churchyard along a narrow Lane that led to a Gate in the Fields which I observing was for turning back Hold said he you are not to return so soon as you imagine Upon saying this he whistled thro' his Fingers and I was upon the Instant surrounded by six of his Footmen who immediateiy seiz'd and bound me Now take that Hypocrite and do as I order'd you Know thou Fool cry'd he looking me full in the Face I have taken all the Time I had before I sent to thee to think how I shou'd punish thee for thy Breach of Friendship and the Loss of  Isabella  With that taking a Whip from one of his Servants he gave me several severe Lashes then spitting in my Face order'd his Footmen to tie me to the Gate and leave me Fury and Shame had ty'd up my Tongue at this indignant Usage therefore I cou'd not utter a Word and if the Tears had not gush'd from my Eyes I believe my Heart  wou'd have burst with Passion My Struggles to get loose were to no purpose and my Strength fail'd me with my fruitless Efforts Which the Villain perceiving repeated his Indignities I know you will endeavour cry'd he to seek me out in hopes to revenge this Affront but be assur'd Fool whenever thou com'st in my way expect to meet with the same Chastisement Upon this he and his Fellows left me almost dead with boiling Rage It was not long however that I continu'd in this Condition for  Isabella  sent the Clark after me to observe our Motions who on the other side of the Hedge heard how I was us'd but durst not appear till the Villain was gone for fear of tasting the same bitter Cup  As soon as I was at Liberty I ran without speaking a Word got upon my Horse and flew after the Villain but my Rage had so blinded me I had not put the Tongue of the Buckle of the Girt as I suppose firm in its Place for I got ready my Horse myself not having Patience to wait for any one so that I came with the Saddle between my Legs upon the Ground over the Crupper of my Horse tho' without any Hurt But it was so late ere I cou'd catch him again that I was  well assur'd the Wretch had reach'd his Dwelling tho' thirty Mile from the Village where I had left  Isabella  However I went on with my Pursuit not considering the poor Beast till he was so tir'd I cou'd hardly get him along therefore I went into a little by Alehouse resolving to stay till the Morning I never went to Bed for my furious Passion was too violent for Rest My Time was spent in casting about how to be reveng'd on the injurious Villain At last I fix'd on this Expedient I procur'd a Disguise ombred my Face and appear'd as a Gypsy I got the next Day to the Villain's Castle which is seated upon an Eminence that overlooks a Plain of two Miles round and not one House but his own in that Circuit It was a good while ere I cou'd see any of the Family but at last a little black Boy came out with a Bow and Arrow to shoot at a Mark he put up against a Tree but as soon as he perceiv'd me he ran back as if in a Fright While I was looking after him I saw the Villain meet him who took him by the Hand and encourag'd him to come towards me first looking circumspectly about him When he came to me he cry'd Here you Gypsy tell this black young Devil his Fortune No Villain  I reply'd I am come to tell thee thy Fortune behold this injur'd Face disguis'd as it is He knew my Voice and was for running back but I got between him and the House drew my Sword that I had conceal'd under my Greatcoat and intercepted his Passage He seeing no Hopes of escaping drew his and as Despair makes Cowards valiant he made several violent Thrusts at me but to no purpose for at last I sent him breathless to the Ground with my Sword thro' his Body As soon as he fell I flew over the Plain without being pursu'd took off my Disguise wrapping some Stones in it and sunk it in a Pond on the Skirts of a Wood as I pass'd along unperceiv'd by any one I got to the Alehouse in my own Person and that Night came back to  Isabella  and her Relations who spent the time of my Absence in great Inquietudes I have not let them yet into the whole Affair Neither have I consider'd with myself whether to own the Deed or not Pursuit I know has been made after the Gypsy but no Enquiry after me If I surrender myself to the Law I do not fear a Pardon for the flagrant Usage I receiv'd from that bad Man will plead for me The Clark nay even his own Servants will be sufficient Witnesses of it How  wou'd you advise me to proceed my dear  Vaughan  I told him I thought it wou'd be time enough to ward against it when he was call'd upon to answer but it was my Opinion he wou'd not have any farther Trouble about it since he was not suspected  We had scarce ended our Discourse when a Servant came in very much surpriz'd and told us there were several Officers of Justice with a great Crowd of People with 'em arm'd enquiring for my Friend crying they had a Warrant to apprehend him for Murder I own I was rash enough to advise the opposing 'em But he declar'd he wou'd surrender without Resistance and rely upon his Innocence and Provocation While I was arguing the Affair with my Friend the Officers came into the Room where we were accompany'd by my Uncle my Brother and  Clerimont  My Friend surrendred without the least Shew of Resistance As I was going down Stairs to accompany him to Prison he stop'd me begging it as a Favour I wou'd not go with him Consider said he you have not recover'd your Strength and I know your Friendship so well that it will but disorder you to see the Place where I am going My Uncle join'd with him Come  come  Billy  said my Uncle the Sick must be us'd like Old Age you and I will stay behind and fear nothing I have Interest enough in this Country to have your Friend well us'd and I have not the least Fear he will suffer for an Action no Man of Honour cou'd avoid Think of the happy Moment that is now approaching  Isabella  my Boy the charming  Isabella  will be your own in a few Days My dear Uncle I reply'd tho' I think every Minute an Age till my Angelick  Isabella  is mine yet I can't think of that Happiness while my dear Friend is in Misery Thy Friend reply'd my Uncle will be free from Trouble before the MarriageCeremony can be finish'd There are Writings to be drawn Settlements made and several things to be in Order before we can enter upon that Affair Besides I wou'd not come too abruptly into a Business that must last for Life You must approach your Happiness by degrees  My dear Uncle I reply'd the Thought of my coming Bliss is so great that was it not qualify'd by some Fear I cou'd not bear my Transport I have felt the Malevolence of that blind Disposer Chance so often I must own I am still in doubt even when I am in  full Possession of all my Joy I shall tremble for fear of losing her Sickness and Death visit the Youthful as well as those sunk in the Vale of Life and if that grim Tyrant who rudely thrusts even to the Beds of Monarchs shou'd intrude with his Icy Dart to that of my divine  Isabella  alas with what Terrors must I bear the remaining Hours of Life since my Religion will not suffer me to put an end to it  These imaginary Ills reply'd my Uncle wrong thy Understanding Wou'd you think of Shipwrack in the Port or refuse refreshing Sleep for fear of melancholy Dreams No no the World of Happiness is in thy View the lovely Prospect stands before thee free from the Storms of Fortune  Whatever my good Uncle cou'd say to me on the joyful Subject gave me but a gloomy Satisfaction My dear Uncle did all in his Power to settle my Thoughts in Joy and by degrees my Heart was so full of it that my Eyes o'erflow'd with Transports and I appear'd all Air and Spirits  My dear Uncle said I be so good to relate some Passages of the unfortunate End of my good Father and wicked Motherinlaw that the Sorrow may alleviate this mighty Joy  My Letter reply'd my Uncle inform'd thee of every thing concerning that nevertobeforgotten Catastrophe But searching that evil Woman's Cabinet I found this Copy of a Letter she sent to  Wigmore  with his Answer to it which convinces me that he was not that Penitent he pretended to be Upon this my Uncle took a couple of Letters out of his Pocket and gave 'em me to read The first was that of my vile Motherinlaw's as follows  My dear dear  Wigmore  I  HAD counterfeited Repentance so well for our past Loves that I almost believ'd I cou'd forget thee But alas that is not in my Power Why should we not love on Am I the only Woman in  England  false to her Husband The Court and the City ay every Town Village and Hamlet in this wealthy Island have sufficient Numbers to keep me in Countenance  Nay my Love is a Virtue if Constancy's a Virtue for I can love none but thee You ever reign triumphant in my Heart and ever shall What are these Bonds of Matrimony that tie two People together against their Inclination but the imaginary Line that crosses the Globe 'Tis  true we are coupled together by Law like two Hounds in a Slip often tugging different ways but their Joys are unbounded when those Couples are unbuckled that keep 'em together But what Law does Love obey  I have read somewhere it is a Law or Custom stronger than a Law even in many Nations at this Day That when a Man even a Stranger comes to stay all Night in a Place the goodnatur'd Husband civilly abandons his House for that Night leaving his new Guest in full Possession of his House and Wife as the greatest Compliment he can pay him Oh if that Custom was but in use here I shou'd wish my Husband abroad for ever and my dear  Wigmore  my amiable Traveller every Night in the Year in my Arms  I need not tell thee that the  Romans  were the Conquerors of the Universe and the wisest of all Nations and yet one of their greatest Orators lent his Wife to his Friend and receiv'd her again to his Bosom without any Stain to Virtue However I have some Hopes my HousholdPlague is upon his Journey to Heaven for he has been long ling'ring with a happy Illness I own I have some Thoughts of providing him PostHorses to carry him to his Journey's End Oh how happy shou'd I be  then in the Possession of my belov'd  Wigmore  without the Fears and Terrors that imbitter my Life of Love and Joy in thy endearing Company  I have with great Difficulty prevail'd upon the old Woman to continue our Emissary but if I had not inform'd her my Soninlaw  William  was gone upon his foreign Travels she wou'd never have consented  I'll meet you this Evening in the SummerHouse and let you in myself I have provided you a Key of the BackGarden Gate that after tonight you may take all Opportunities of seeing me without Danger of being discover'd Our Gardener is turn'd away thro' my means who I thought began to be a little too observing My Husband's Illness Curse on that Name will prevent his coming into that Part of the Garden and I shall take care of every body else by locking the Door after me  I shall think Time has no Wings till I am happy in thy lov'd Embraces yet tho' I see thee not with my corporal Eyes thou art ever present to my Mind and shalt ever possess the Body and Soul of  Thine entirely J V  When I had read the Letter my Uncle cry'd Surely this Woman had Impudence enough to bestride the  There was a Custom in the Manor of  East  and  West Enborn  in  Berkshire  call'd  FreeBench  that is If the Husband dies the Widow shall have his  Free Bench  in all his CopyholdLands but if it is prov'd she has had during her Widowhood criminal Conversation with any Man she forfeits her Estate but if she will come into the Court of Justice riding backwards on a  Black Ram  with his Tail in her Hand repeating the following Lines she may have her Estate again  Here I am  Riding upon a  Black Ram  Like a Whore as I am  And for my  Crincum Crancum  Have lost my  Bincum Bancum  And for my Tail's Game  Have done this worldly Shame  Therefore I pray you Mr  Steward  let me have my Land again  Black Ram  without changing Colour Heavens how were we deceiv'd with this vile Woman's false Penitence Whenever I think on't I am pierc'd to the Heart But come let us after these Letters are destroy'd bury all Thoughts of this pernicious Woman and all her vile Machinations  But to the other and then commit them both to the Flames  Wigmore  's Answer was as follows  My Adorable  I  AM prevented seeing you this Evening by the violent Attacks of an Ague and Fever Your Epistle pleases me and vexes me Your Continuance of Love compels my Heart to adore your Goodness but the Thoughts of using Violence towards your Husband raise such Indignation in my Breast that any future Thoughts upon that Subject will I am assur'd make me hate you for I have lov'd too well to despise you Do we not injure him enough in our criminal Conversation My Soul and Conscience those dreadful Monitors tell me 'tis criminal tho' my Heart fill'd with Love has no room to entertain the terrible Idea  I promis'd your good Brotherinlaw and that worthy young Gentleman that once detected us in our Crimes to go to some other Part of the World but was disappointed against my  then  Inclination But our fatal Loves pray Heaven they do not prove fatal hang upon me worse than my Ague and I must submit to their allpowerful Force But if you wou'd have me love you long banish all Thoughts of injuring your Husband farther than our Loves the very mentioning of it in your Letter made my Body shiver and my Blood run cold and I am  convinc'd brought this Fit of the Ague upon me which prevents my seeing you till tomorrow Evening if I have any Intermission My Body is yours but do not load my Soul with any farther Guilt for shou'd you mention that horrid Deed again I wou'd fly you as I wou'd the most spreading Contagion whatever my Heart wou'd suffer never to see you more Weigh well what I here write for 'tis the Advice of a Friend and one whom irresistible Fate has made  Your intire and affectionate Lover WIGMORE  P S  Send the Key of the Garden by the Bearer of this seal'd up that she may not know all our Secrets  If you have any of the Cortex by you pray divide it into eight equal Parts and send it me that I hope will prevent the Return of my Fit  These two Letters said my Uncle when I first met with 'em gave me infinite Pain when I consider'd our Credulity in trusting that vile wicked Woman had drawn this fatal Sorrow on our Heads  I thought it Wisdom to conceal this Tragical Story from the World therefore gave it out thy worthy Father dy'd a natural Death his long Indisposition giving it Credit But there was no concealing the End of that miserable Woman therefore to screen her Ignominy we reported she had given her Son  Johnny  by mistake Physic so strong that had purg'd him into another World This with the Loss of her Husband we gave out had turn'd her Brain so that she was forc'd to be secur'd in her Closet but in endeavouring to get out of the Window met her Fate Tho' many I fear judg'd the true Cause of her Death  But now my dear Child turn thy Thoughts from every melancholy Subject and look upon the lovely  Isabella  who was then entring the Chamber who shortly shall be thine I was ever his reply'd the Charmer of my Soul and if I had wedded that ridiculous Wretch whose End has brought us into some Trouble it was only out of an obstinate Revenge for your suppos'd Falshood but that Revenge wou'd have fallen upon myself for Death wou'd in a few Days have ended my Miseries  In the Letter the base Sir  Eustace  sent to your converted Friend concerning the fatal Consequence of your Persidy he told him of my being brought insensible out of the Garden But he cou'd not describe the terrible Agonies Heartbreaking Sighs and dark Despair my Soul was fill'd with I read the fatal Letter a thousand times over examin'd well the Hand and tho' the Direction was not in the same Character I found the Seal and the Letter were yours  Nothing gave me greater Proof of your Infidelity than your Silence I wou'd often cry  Ungrateful Man hast thou then forsaken me  I even study'd Means to excuse you but cou'd not find one No I cou'd not find the least Glimpse to hope the contrary  I discover'd to my Mother and Aunt the Progress of our young Amours whose Goodness never rebuk'd me for my Weakness but thought as I did that you were false My Mother remov'd me to a neighbouring Lady's of her Acquaintance that I might not have in mind even the Place where you first utter'd your false Vows  With much Persuasion of your Rival and my Friends I fix'd the Day of our Nuptials and to say the Truth his Behaviour  was much mended he seem'd to wear a more solid Air and express'd his Love with so sincere a Freedom that I often wish'd I cou'd give him that Heart you held so fast  The Night before the Morning intended for my Nuptials was spent in the utmost Grief of Heart and when my Mother and Aunt came in the Morning to dress me for the Solemnity I had not Strength to rise without Help I was seiz'd with a violent Fever which confin'd me to my Bed for near three Months The intended Bridegroom spent his whole Time at my ChamberDoor and appear'd inconsolable I must own to you I began from his Behaviour to give him some part of my Esteem but my Heart was not in my Power to give him tho' I often wish'd it had I thought it was a most unbecoming Weakness to lament one who paid my Sufferings with Disdain Therefore once more the Day was fix'd and if alljudging Heaven had not sent your Friend that very Moment what but my Death must have follow'd when I had understood that my dear  Vaughan  was innocent  O Heavens I reply'd the very Thought fills me with the utmost Agony Well well reply'd my Uncle when you are once wedded  you'll begin to talk like your reasonable People at present your Senses are in a Hurry and every Faculty bewilder'd in a Maze of I don't know what But Time and Marriage will restore you to your Understandings  We were interrupted by my Man's telling me Mrs  Betty  was arriv'd and beg'd to see me When she came in she look'd wistfully upon me and burst into Tears What  Betty  said I are you griev'd to see me again She cou'd not utter one Word but ran up to me took me about the Neck and almost drowned me with Weeping The poor Creature's Love fill'd my Heart with a grateful Tenderness When she had found the Use of her Tongue she cry'd O my dear Master the Sight of you gives me more Pleasure than ever I did feel or can feel I have not known one Moment's Joy since your Absence She said so many kind things that I cou'd not refrain kissing her tenderly  My dear  Isabella  said I you must allow Mrs  Betty  some small Share in my Heart with you whose faithful Friendship tho' a Servant I shall never forget and will make it my future Study to recompense her uncommon Fidelity That Sir reply'd my Uncle shall be my Care one Woman is enough  for one Man to take care of You are in the right reply'd the divine  Isabella  But now I think on't I have left  Fatima  and  Eliza  preparing to follow your Brother and  Clerimont  to the Prison and I came to you my dear  Vaughan  to lay my Commands upon you to stay with your Uncle till our Return My Uncle myself and  Betty  were uttering the Fulness of our Hearts with the utmost Contentment when a Person that belong'd to the Inn came running up Stairs in the utmost Confusion For Heaven's sake Sir said he run into the Garden and lend your Assistance to a Lady that some Villains are hurrying away into a Boat against her Will  My Uncle and I ran down upon the Instant with our Swords in our Hands but O Heavens what was my Terror and Sur+prize when I discover'd my dear  Isabella  in a Boat held by Force in the Arms of a Person a Stranger to me and six Men rowing down the Stream with their utmost Force The unexpected Sight took away my Senses and had I not lean'd my Back against a Tree I must have fallen to the Ground  There was a small Boat at the Landingplace in the Garden which when I could recover my Strength I got into so suddenly  that my Uncle cou'd not prevent me When I had push'd it off with my Foot I found too late I had neither Oar nor Pole to manage her so that she drove down the Stream without my being able to stop her  My Fury and Impatience almost took away my Senses The Boat drove for two Hours before it stopt against a Bank and then it was so dark when I got out of it I cou'd not see my way I thought it to no purpose to put off the Boat again and notwithstanding my Impatience I was forc'd to grope about to find some Path but all to no purpose therefore I was wandering about till Daylight and then had the Misfortune to find I was got upon a little Island in the River  Wye  I then endeavour'd to find the Boat again but all to no Purpose  I was now plung'd into the utmost Despair A thousand times I form'd Resolutions fatal to my Life I accus'd Heaven Fortune and unlucky Stars I cou'd not help saying to my self What Sins have I committed that my Punishment in this World must be beyond Human Nature to bear How happy did I think myself after all my Misfortunes but twelve Hours ago Cou'd mortal Man imagine after running thro' so many various  Scenes of unfortunate Incidents and then to have the Cure of all my Sorrows within my reach to have her snatch'd from me in my own native Soil a Country fam'd for her wholsome Laws by a Stranger for I own I cou'd not remember I had ever observ'd the Face of the villainous Ravisher I sometimes imagin'd it was all a Dream but to my cruel Grief I was too well assur'd I was awake  I waited till the Sun had made a full three Hours Course upon the Island in hope my Uncle and my Friends wou'd find some means of following me but to no purpose I cou'd hear People talk upon the Shore behind the Willows but when I call'd to 'em for their Assistance cou'd get no Answer My Mind was so disturb'd that my Reason seem'd to fly me and my Spirits were so low and faint that I had not Strength to walk However I took the Resolution of plunging into the Water to swim to the opposite Shore but the Weight of my Cloaths the Rapidity of the Stream and my Weakness hurry'd me to the Bottom and if I had not been assisted by two Fishermen who were mending their Nets on the Shore and saw me throw myself into the Water I must have inevitably  perish'd They drew me into their Boat depriv'd of Sense for some time and carry'd me to their Cottage strip'd me of my wet Cloaths and put me to Bed When I came to myself I bewail'd my Misfortunes in such a manner that the Fishermen imagin'd I had thrown myself into the River to put an end to 'em Upon that Supposition they began to comfort me and inquir'd into the Cause of my Sorrows But when I had inform'd 'em one of 'em cry'd out to the other As sure as can be the Woman we heard last Night calling for Help was the very Person this Gentleman is in quest of  They told me about an Hour after Day was shut in last Night they heard a Lady cry violently and a Man comforting her but the Boatmen row'd so fast down the Stream they were soon out of Hearing This Knowledge rous'd up my Spirits and the Thoughts of Vengeance gave me new Strength I got my Cloaths dry'd with the utmost Expedition and dress'd myself but inquiring after my Hat and Sword they reply'd they knew nothing of them I did not doubt but I had lost 'em when I was in the Water yet was distress'd how to get more The Fishermen offer'd to carry me in their Boat to  Chepstow    Chepstow  in  Monmouthshire  a MarketTown seated upon the River  Wye  very near where that River falls into the  Severn  with a large wooden Bridge over it There is a natural Fortification of Rocks and Mountains tho' it has been formerly fortify'd There is still the Remains of an old Castle built by  Julius Caesar  as the Inhabitants will have it The Tide flows here fourteen Yards high  where I might accommodate myself I accepted of their Offer and we got into their Boat upon the Instant However I borrow'd a Hat of one of 'em and an old Pair of HorsePistols the only Arms that belong'd to them The Boat was a very old sluggish one that did not answer my impatient Desire of getting to the Town and it was with much Persuasion I did not go on Shore to walk They told me about a Mile farther there was a little Creek where I might land and walk to  Chepstow  sooner than the Boat cou'd get there When we came into the Creek we perceiv'd a Boat with a Man asleep in't and I strongly imagin'd it was the very Boat that the Ravisher had row'd away in with my dear  Isabella  My Blood at that Thought thrill'd thro' my Veins and I was just ready to shoot the poor Wretch as he lay asleep in the Boat  I order'd my two Fishermen to row up close to the other Boat but the Noise of our Oars awak'd the Man who started up to look at us As soon as I came near enough to lay hold of the Fellow I seiz'd him by the Throat and clap'd a Pistol to his Head The Man was so scar'd at my manner of Proceeding that he was ready to die with Apprehension Villain said I if thou dost not this Moment declare where thy vile Master has carry'd the young Lady he took away by Force Yesterday this Moment is thy last For Heaven's sake reply'd the Fellow don't murder an innocent Man that has done nothing but by the Command of his Master whom he is oblig'd to obey As for the Lady you mention I know no more where she is gone than you do All that I do know I'll tell you with all my Heart  Sir  Eustace  landed at this Place late last Night with the Lady and his Servants My Master the Owner of this Boat attended him telling me he wou'd return by Break of Day this Morning and ordering me to take care of the Boat in the mean time I own I am very much in fear some Accident has befallen him I do suppose he went last Night to  Chepstow  with Sir  Eustace  and his Lady  whom he seiz'd at  Monmouth  Monmouth  the Capital of  Monmouthshire  seated upon the River  Wye  is an old Town of great Antiquity as appears by the Ruins of its Walls and Castle It is surrounded with Hills This Place is famous for the Birth of our  Henry  the Fifth who conquer'd a great Part of  France  as also for our  British  Historian  Geofrey of Monmouth  tho' a Writer full of the Monkish Tales of those Times  He inform'd my Master that the Day he marry'd her she ran away with a young Gentleman which I suppose to be yourself But dear Sir blame not me I am as I told you before but a Servant to the Owner of the Boat Sir  Eustace  I cry'd is that Villain still living or do you abuse me Really reply'd the Man I know no more than that my Master call'd him so and if it is the same that you mean he is lately recover'd of a dangerous Wound he receiv'd about a Month ago by a Gentleman in Disguise  I cou'd not help crying out with the utmost Transport of Fury Yes it is the same and Heaven has permitted the Wretch to live that I with my own Hand may take sure Vengeance on such a Villain for all the Misery he has heap'd upon my Head I then inform'd the Man in short of the Villainy  of that infamous Traitor Sir  Eustace  My two Fishermen and he seem'd thunderstruck at the Relation My Fishermen were afraid to assist me any further they did not doubt they said if such a base Man should hear of it he wou'd not stick to have them murder'd for they had often heard of his vile Actions in the Country But when I inform'd 'em my Uncle naming his Name had as many powerful Friends in that Country as he had one of the Men cry'd What Sir are you the Nephew to that worthy Gentleman When I answer'd in the Affirmative he told me he wou'd run the Hazard of his Life to serve me upon his Account nay and answer for his Companion We owe both our Lives to him Notwithstanding my own unhappy Condition I cou'd not refrain asking the Man which way my Uncle had been so serviceable to them  Sir reply'd the Man my Companion and I were taken up for a Murder and Robbery and tho' innocent as yourself yet the Jury found us Guilty Nay we must own the Appearances were strong against us I'll give your Honour the Story in as few Words as possible  About three Quarters of a Year ago as my Partner and I were fishing in this River we perceiv'd a Hat floating down the Stream which we took up We waited some Hours imagining some Body wou'd come to claim it but no one appearing my Partner gave me half a Crown for my Share being in more want of a Hat than myself He wore it generally Sundays and Holidays without any one claiming it About the Time we found the Hat a young Fellow frequented a by Alehouse in the Neighbourhood for two or three Days where my Companion and I us'd often to drink One Day while we were there he offer'd to pawn a gold Medal to the Landlord of the House he not having Money enough to spare came to me and desired I wou'd lend him three Guineas upon it the Medal weighing at least five Guineas I made no Scruple but let the young Man have the Money with this Agreement that if he did not redeem it in a Fortnight I wou'd dispose of it for I told him I cou'd not be out of my Money for a longer Time He consented and the next Evening disappear'd of a sudden  The following Day as we were drawing our Nets we perceiv'd something very heavy  but we were very much surpris'd when dragging it ashore to find a murder'd Body in it with several Wounds upon the Head in a lightcolour'd Suit of Cloaths trim'd with a small Silver Edging We acquainted the Country with it and the next Day it was own'd to be an old Lady's Son who had been missing some time The Corps was bury'd by the sorrowful Mother and no Enquiry cou'd find out the Murderer  A few Days after this the  Easter  Holidays came on and my Partner and I went to see some Friends at  Monmouth  but my chief Reason of going was to dispose of my gold Medal My Companion went to have his Hat done something to while I went to a Goldsmith's to dispose of my Medal When I offer'd it to the Man of the Shop he examin'd it very narrowly then looking me wistfully in the Face ask'd me how I came by it When I had inform'd him he reply'd Very well I'll carry it to a Person in the Neighbourhood that perhaps will give more than the Weight of it I seem'd very well satisfy'd  The Goldsmith went out but return'd in a Quarter of an Hour with the Constable and several Assistants and in short charg'd  me with the Murder and Robbery of the Widow's Son I was instantly carry'd before a Justice and examin'd and before my Examination was over my Partner was brought in by the Hatter who swore the Hat he brought to him he sold to the young unfortunate Gentleman that was murder'd These Circumstances meeting thus together it was agreed on all Hands that we were guilty of the Murder and what confirm'd People's Opinion was that the Landlord of the Alehouse where I had the Medal deny'd the Fact  Upon this we gave up ourselves for lost I having some small Share of Education drew up our Case to be presented to the Judges but it did us no good for we were condemn'd to die for the Guilt of another Person  Your good Uncle was at the Trial by Accident and whether by our Countenance or some Proceedings in our Trial I can't tell but he seem'd to think us innocent He examin'd us strictly about the young Man I had the Medal from as to his Age Shape Size and what Dress he wore When he had done that he left us desiring us to recommend our selves to Heaven tho' he own'd he thought  we dy'd for an Act we had never committed  We prepar'd ourselves for Death not having the least Hopes of Life The Morning that was intended for our Execution your good Uncle enter'd our Room in the Prison first preparing by degrees our Spirits to receive the unlook'dfor Change in our Condition He inform'd us we were at our Liberty and brought a Surgeon with him whom he order'd to let us both Blood  I was said your Uncle convinc'd of your Innocency but what made me more assur'd of it was that I had seen a young Fellow taken up at  Hereford  where I had some Business for offering to sell a gold Watch that he cou'd give but a slender Account how he came by it I came into the Court at  Monmouth  just as your Trial came on After you were found Guilty I inform'd the Judges of my Suspicions and I thought it the Duty of every Gentleman to use his Endeavour to clear the Innocent I immediately return'd to  Hereford  after enquiring of you all the Circumstances of your Defence and dealt with the Prisoner so effectually that he confess'd every thing He inform'd me that he had been long a Companion to the Widow's  Son and both living a disorderly Life he prevail'd upon him to rob his Mother of a Sum of Money and imbark for the  WestIndies  but the Devil put it into his Mind to murder him which he did by first stabbing him with a pointed Hanger and after cutting him over the Head with the same Weapon for fear his Groans might be overheard by somebody by Accident he took from him a Purse of sixtyfour Guineas the fatal Medal a Diamond Ring and the gold Watch he was taken up for in endeavouring to sell it at  Hereford  The poor Wretch was assur'd that Heaven wou'd not let Murder be hid for as he intended for  Ireland  he might have dispos'd of both Medal and Watch with Safety there But he knew the Devil infatuated his Mind  Your good Uncle continu'd the Fisherman made him sign his Confession and he took such farther Measures with the Judges that he procur'd our Liberty and not only that but made a Gathering for us among the Gentlemen of the Country that amounted with his own Bounty to an hundred and thirty five Pounds  Now Sir since you are Nephew to that noble Gentleman to whom we owe our Lives  and Fortunes command us what you please as far as Honesty and our Power may carry us and we will instantly obey you  While the Fisherman was relating this short Story his Companion spy'd a Hat floating against the Bank of the Creek which I knew to be my own but both the Men were so very much startled at the Sight of it that neither of 'em wou'd take it up However I got the young Fellow in the other Boat who was not so scrupulous to get it for me who understanding the villainous Treatment I had receiv'd from the Wretch that hir'd the Boat of his Master was resolv'd to join with the other two  While we were consulting how to proceed the Owner of the Boat came down to the Creek My Blood rose at the Man tho' I knew he had been impos'd upon by that base Villain Sir  Eustace  However I resolv'd to be silent in hope I shou'd learn something from him As soon as he came near enough his Man ask'd him how he could leave him all Night in such a Place without Victuals Drink or Rest Zds reply'd the Man you have had more Rest than I I dare swear Never was poor Wretch so ill us'd as I have been When I came within a Quarter of a  Mile of  Chepstow  the Villain order'd his Servants to bind my Hands and Feet and throw me into a Ditch which by good Fortune prov'd a dry one The Reason why my Friend cry'd the Brute I part with your good Company is because I wou'd not have you know where I intend to lie tonight perhaps in a little Time I shall find some Method of satisfying you for the Trouble you have been at upon my account And so Friend I wish you a good Night's Rest  Upon saying this he and his wicked Crew walk'd away although I begg'd to be releas'd promising I would return to my Boat without following them But he reply'd No no that is one Reason why I would have you lie there all Night  Pray Friend said I in what Condition was the poor young Lady that he forcibly carry'd away Why truly Sir reply'd the Man I can't well tell for she had mourn'd so much in the Boat that when we landed she did not utter a Word but suffer'd herself to be led by her Husband without any Resistance  I soon undeceiv'd him in that Particular by acquainting him with the Truth of the  sorrowful Affair And is it so reply'd the Master of the Boat If I had known that no Recompence or Threats should have prevail'd upon me to have lent him any Assistance in such a base Action  After a short Consultation I resolv'd with the Master of the Boat to go by Land to  Chepstow  while the two Fishermen and the other Man carry'd the Boats there  Accordingly we parted But as soon as we enter'd the Town the first Persons I saw were my dear Uncle my Brother my Friend and  Clerimont  with four Servants all well arm'd in search after the Ravisher and me They hir'd a Boat at  Monmouth  with all the Expedition imaginable thinking to overtake me at least and as we all suppos'd mist me when the Boat I was in fell in with the little Island where I remain'd all Night They were going when we met 'em down to the Creek to endeavour the finding the Man that was bound and thrown into the Ditch being inform'd of it by the very Person that had releas'd him in the Morning  We came to a Resolution of separating My Brother and I with two Servants to get Horses and go into  Wales  in pursuit of  them my Uncle my Friend and the other two Servants to follow by Water my Governor to stay at  Chepstow  or  Monmouth  just as he thought convenient  My Brother and I with two Servants set out well arm'd for our Purpose without taking any formal Leave of my Uncle and the rest for I was too much concern'd to mind Ceremony As we pass'd the Mountains that environ  Chepstow  the Horse of one of my Uncle's Servants fell downright lame which gave me some little Uneasiness But the Fellow being RunningFootman to the last Master he serv'd told us he would be at the next Town before us and provide himself another Horse Accordingly he left the lame one at a Cottage in the Road and flew away as swift as a Greyhound The Roads were so bad for our Horses that he was soon out of Sight After riding about four Miles we came to a small Inn where I was surpriz'd to find him drinking with a Footman at the Door As soon as we came near enough for him to be heard he call'd out to me Sir for a small matter I can have a Horse of this Man who is a Servant to Sir  Eustace  and as we are to go within a Mile of his Master's House I am to leave  the Horse at a Place where he has appointed his Business not being urgent he says he will walk the rest of the Way  The Name of that Villain Sir  Eustace  and the manner of the Servant's speaking to me convinc'd me there was something to be understood by it I therefore endeavour'd to compose myself from the Ruffle the Villain's Name had caus'd in my Soul I soon observ'd the Fellow was very much gone in Liquor therefore was in some Hope of learning which way my dear  Isabella  was forc'd He did not seem to have any Notion of us or our Business therefore I told him I intended to make a Visit to his Master at my Return Hark ye Sir reply'd the Fellow to tell you the Truth if you do you'll lose your Labour for my Master is not at home at present neither can I tell you when he will be at home Nor does he much care interrupted my Uncle's Man for I find his Master and he don't set their Horses together  I must own I did tell you so return'd the Man but you are to blame to let all the World know it There's no Harm done I reply'd he knows I want a Servant therefore if you intend to leave Sir  Eustace  and  he'll give you a Character I'll take you into my Service A Character Sir cry'd the Man hastily I am afraid his Character will be but small Encouragement for me to get another Master I must conceal if possible my ever living with him Sir I must beg your Pardon when I tell you as one of my Masters Acquaintance he is so wicked a Man that I think no one that is not as wicked as himself would live with him  In short I soon found the Fellow was too honest in his Principles for so impious a Master And yet one wou'd think continu'd the Servant he shou'd take Warning It is not above six Weeks ago when a Gentleman he had ill us'd in Disguise run him through the Body We all thought he wou'd have breath'd his last but he recover'd in less than a Month the Wound not being through any Mortal Part He order'd his Servants and the Surgeon to conceal his Recovery from the Country But we were soon let into the Meaning of it for he went disguis'd two Days ago to  Monmouth  under Pretence to take up the Gentleman for his supposed Murder but it was only to take his Opportunity of running away with a young Lady whom he says he's contracted  to which he did and is now gone to  Bristol  for more Secrecy and Security where he intends to force the Lady to marry him or perhaps worse  I was so much disorder'd with what the Man said to me my Passion overcoming my Reason that I declar'd aloud I wou'd be the Death of him The poor Fellow began to suspect something and the Apprehension of some Ill Usage threw him into such a Fit of Trembling that he soon became sober He begg'd for Heaven's sake he might not suffer for the Evil Deeds of his Master  No my Friend said I I have some Regard for thee for thy Honesty because I think by thy Discourse thou dost not approve the wicked Designs of that base Villain Therefore if thou wilt receive me for thy Master be assur'd it is in my Nature to use every one well that has any Dependance upon me  Sir reply'd the young Fellow you seem so far different in your Behaviour from my present Master that I shall think myself got out of Purgatory into Paradise We soon made an Agreement to the Satisfaction of us both  He then inform'd me his Master had dispatch'd him to his Castle in  Wales  for several Necessaries for himself and the Servants that were gone with him to  Bristol  which were privately to be brought in a Waggon for he apprehended it was not safe to bring the Lady home immediately not doubting in the least but the Gentleman that wounded him before wou'd pursue him with the Company he had so much exasperated by his villainous Proceeding  Upon the Knowledge of this we return'd back to  Chepstow  in order to get to  Bristol  with the utmost Expedition When we came back to  Chepstow  we were inform'd my Uncle with his Party had hir'd a Vessel to go for  Bristol  which made us imagine he had gain'd some Knowledge of the Place where they were gone  We only staid to give our Horses some small Refreshment and set forward by Land for  Bristol  tho' we were two Hours ferrying over  When we arriv'd at  Bristol  my new Servant told me his old Master was at Captain in  Radcliff  Street overagainst the Church My Brother and I disguis'd ourselves in our Servants Cloaths and  went to the House where we were inform'd Sir  Eustace  and my dear  Isabella  were The Door was shut some time but after half an Hour's waiting we saw the Villain coming out with a Gentleman that we suppos'd to be the Master of the House My Blood flew with such Violence thro' my Veins that it was with much Persuasion of my Brother I had not shot the Villain through the Head But he advis'd me to use Stratagem  Let us said he send for your new Servant and by the time he comes we'll think of something to compass our Ends without Bloodshed When the Servant came we instructed him to go to the Lady as from his Master and with a Ring as a Token for his Passport which I gave him which was my dear  Isabella  's I did not doubt but she would know it again and come more willingly  My new Man did his Business dexterously He found the Chamber of  Isabella  guarded by two of his old FellowServants who made no Scruple of letting him pass when he acquainted them he had Orders to conduct the Lady to his Master in order to be marry'd that Night  When he came into the Room where the divine  Isabella  was lamenting her Condition in Tears and Sighs upon the Floor he without Ceremony gave her the Ring telling her the Owner of it waited for her in the Street if she cou'd give Credit to that Passport she might be in the Arms of her devoted Husband in a few Minutes She look'd upon the Ring some time with the utmost Transport of Joy as the Man told us afterwards and at last said Though my terrible Misfortunes make me suspect every thing and every Person yet whatever Hands I fall into I can't fear worse Usage than from those I have the Misfortune to be in at present  She then gave my new Servant her Hand who led her down Stairs telling the two Centries at the Door to order a handsome Supper for their Master wou'd be back in less than an Hour  When we perceiv'd him coming with the divine  Isabella  I trembled so much I had not Power to stand but my Brother fearing my Transports might discover us led me some distance from the House But when my lovely  Isabella  came up to me neither of us cou'd utter a Word My Brother  wou'd not let us stay to open our Hearts but took hold of my dear  Isabella  and hurry'd her along while I follow'd not knowing what I was doing  As we were crossing the Bridge we met my Uncle and his Party they not expecting to meet us By the Light of the Shops upon the Bridge knowing  Isabella  they drew their Swords and had not my Brother discover'd himself that Instant some of my Friends had probably lost their Lives for in the Heat of my Fury I mistook them as they did us and drew my Pistols but the first flashing in the Pan prevented my doing an Action that I should have for ever repented  We had not time to congratulate each other upon our unexpected meeting but my Uncle and Friends finding we had regain'd  Isabella  led us back to the Boat they came in and notwithstanding the Darkness of the Night we set out from  Bristol  so eagerly that we forgot my Uncle's two Servants at the Inn who were found watching about the House where  Isabella  was confin'd by Sir  Eustace  who by Threats got out of them who they belong'd to A Fellow that saw our Rencounter upon the Bridge had follow'd  us to the Boat and hearing Sir  Eustace  threatning my Uncle's Servants declar'd what he knew concerning us  Upon this he got his Men together took a Boat and follow'd us with such Imprecations that the two Servants of my Uncle's were so frighted for my Safety not knowing their Master was with me that they got a Guide to conduct them along the Waterside to give us Notice of our approaching Danger as they told us afterwards  While we were in the Boat my dear  Isabella  and I mingled our Tears of Joy together She told me when the hated Villain first seiz'd her she had Recourse to Tears Sighs and Reproaches which drew nothing but Threats from the worthless Wretch But at last she thought it wou'd be more to her purpose to dissemble her Sorrows therefore she seem'd by degrees to dry up her Tears and listen more favourably to his odious Love  This Method deceiv'd him so effectually that he did not doubt but she wou'd give her Consent to the Marriage in a few Days She had prevail'd upon one of his Men to bring a Letter to me and he was to set out on the following Morning  We landed at  Weston  and order'd our Boat to meet us at  Thornbury  the next Day where we were oblig'd to go altogether in a Waggon not meeting with any better Conveniency But having the Company of my lovely  Isabella  with my Uncle and Friends I was in as much Joy as if we were riding in our Coach and Six  When we came within half a Mile of  Thornbury  the Fields being pleasant we all got out to walk I with my charming  Isabella  led the Way full of the delightful Hope of possessing for ever that Beauty who was the Treasure of my Soul  Just as we cross'd a Stile that led into the Horse Road I observ'd four or five Men run into a Thicket that led into the Fields on the other Side of the Road This alarm'd me very much and I made a full Stop till my Company came up  By ill Fortune expecting no Danger we had left our Pistols in the Waggon and the shorter Cut being over the Fields the Waggon was a Quarter of a Mile behind us While we were disputing what to do the five Men came running cross the Road with that infamous Villain Sir  Eustace  at the Head of them My Friend knowing him  ran to oppose him unarm'd as he was The Villain fir'd a Pistol at him which brought my Friend to the Ground The Sight rais'd such a Rage in my Soul that I rush'd upon him just as he presented a Pistol to my Breast and so opportunely that I clapt my Hand between the Flint and the Lock just as he drew the Trigger and with struggling to wrench it from him the Flint cut the Back of my Hand very much I at last with much Difficulty wrung it from him and shot him through the Head with his own Pistol  As soon as he fell his Companions in Villainy ran away without once looking behind them and I flew to my Friend who thank Heaven was only wounded slightly on the Temple  This was all done so suddenly that it look'd like a Dream When the Confusion was over we went to examine that impious Wretch who notwithstanding his Villainy I wish'd in my Soul he had Life enough left to repent But alas he was gone for ever with all his Sins about him  When we came to  Thornbury  our Boatmen met us with a Croud of People arm'd with several Weapons coming to our Assistance  The unfortunate Sir  Eustace  overtook them in their short Voyage to  Thornbury  and by Threats made them though unwillingly confess where they were to take us up As soon as Sir  Eustace  parted from them to put his wicked Intentions in Practice the Boatmen alarm'd the Town which we met coming to our Assistance tho' too late  I went to a neighbouring Justice and declar'd what had happen'd who took Bail of my Uncle for my Appearance at the Sessions But I was never troubled about it His Servants were found who took up the Body which was interr'd privately by his younger Brother a worthy Gentleman that prov'd as much an Honour to the Family he sprung from as the other strove to disgrace it  The next Day we embark'd for  Chepstow  and the same Evening arriv'd safe at  Monmouth  to the Comfort of my Governor  Elvira  and the amiable  Fatima  From thence we set out for my Uncle's  In a few Days after my Brother with the fair  Fatima  after receiving at the Font the Christian Name of  Maria  at my Uncle's Request  Clerimont  and his  Eliza  and my dear  Isabella  and I join'd those Hands with the  Assistance of the Priest whose Hearts were united long before And that we might be witness to each others Happiness all dwelt in the same House with my Uncle  Thus after so many Storms of Fortune we arriv'd safe in the Harbour of Delight and tasted Joys beyond Expression Long may our Years continue in all the Harmony of connubial Love All our Wishes are to go Step by Step together and when the hoary Winter of our Age approaches to sink Hand in Hand into the Grave and rest in Peace  FINIS  BOOKS  lately Publish'd and Sold by  J OSBORN  at the  GoldenBall  in
