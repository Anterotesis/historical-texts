your window  Robin at the window  Holloa Who calls there  Patty  We want if you please Robin to be ferry'd over to market  Robin  That you shall my pretty lasses I'll be wi' you presently Bear a hand my lads and be untying the boat  THOMAS and WILLIAM go up to the boat  Fanny  Will you give us a song the while Patty I remember as how you sung us a pretty one last week all about the May  SONGPATTY  Now the wintry storms are o'er  Spring unlocks her verdant store  Smiling pleasure crowns the day  Sweetly breathes the blushing May  O'er the daisypainted mead  Now the wanton lambkins spread  Ever playful ever gay  Fond to welcome in the May  Now responsive through the grove  Softer tun'd to spring and love  Echo with her sportive lay  Joins our carols to the May  During the last stanza ROBIN enters  Robin  Zooks Patty you sing like a skylark but come we'll ha' it in the boat  All  Ay ay we'll ha' it in the boat  ROBIN hands PATTY into the boat the others follow they cross the river singing the first stanza in chorus  Enter MARIAN with a basket of fruit and flowersshe looks after them then sits down on the stile  Marian  They are gone without me the boat goes swiftly with the streamHeighoThey sing they are merry with me those happy days are overEdward thinks me unfaithful and has not been at the Grange these three days He wove me this basket as we sat near the little holt of osiers and willows by the river's side  SONGMARIAN  By the osiers so dank  As we sat on the bank  And look'd at the swell of the billow  This basket he wove  As a token of love  Alas 'twas the branch of the willow  Now sad all the day  Thro' the meadows I stray  And rest flies at night from my pillow  The garland I were  From my ringlets I tore  Alas must I wear the green willow  I'll sit down on the stile and wait Robin's return  Enter Sir HENRY TRUMAN and a SERVANT following  Sir HENRY looks back at the river  Serv  They are only the girls of the village Sir ferrying over to market  Sir H  Here's one seems to be left behind  Serv  'Tis Marian your Honor Oliver Meadow's daughter at the Grange  Sir H  What do you do here pretty Marian Why are you not with your companions  Marian rises and curtsies  I was too late Sir  Sir H  That's pity but you shan't lose your market I'll buy your strawberries carry them up to the hall  gives her moneyShe goes out through the parkgate  How very lovely the pure colouring of nature with the artless smile of simplicity and truth I have observ'd her more than once with admiration when dancing on the village green  To the SERVANT  Let the huntsmen lead the hounds round to the other parkgate we will throw off at the entrance of the heath and let my horses be brought this way  Exit SERVANT  SONGSir HENRY  To the chace to the chace on the brow of the hill  Let the hounds meet the sweetbreathing morn  Whilst full to the welkin their notes clear and shrill  Join the sound of the heartchearing horn  What music celestial when urging the race  Sweet echo repeats "To the chace to the chace"  Our pleasure transports usHow gay flies the hour  Sweet health and quick spirits attend  Not sweeter when evening convenes to the bow'r  And we meet the lov'd smile of a friend  See the stag just before us he starts at the cry  He stopshis strength failsspeak my friendsmust he die  His innocent aspect whilst standing at bay  His expression of anguish and pain  All plead for compassionyour looks seem to say  Let him bound o'er his forests again  Quick release him to dart o'er the neighbouring plain  Let him live let him bound o'er his forests again  The gay expansion of my heart this morning and the flow of good humour which I can scarce express seem propitious to the poor stag if a hunter's enthusiasm does not check it  Enter MARIAN but seeing Sir HENRY she retires  Sir H  Come here MarianWhat is the matter my little girl You don't seem so gay as usual  Marian sighing  No Sir  Sir H  Pray tell me does anything vex you A sweetheart perhaps  Marian  No Sir  he  never vex'd me in his life  Sir H  Then you have a sweetheart pretty Marian  Marian  I  had  Sir There's nobody to blame but my father he consented I shou'd have Edward and was impatient if he did not see him come running over the lea every evening at foldingtime but now my father has changed his mind and says I must hold my head higher  Sir H  And why has he chang'd his mind Marian  Marian  Because I am grown rich Sir My godmother has left me three hundred pounds for a portion and that is the cause of all my misfortunes  Sir H  Where is your father Marian  Marian  Gone to Lincoln with some sheep Sir but I expect him home very early  Sir H  Perhaps I may be able to serve you MarianSend your father to me as soon as he returns  Marian  If your Honor cou'd but persuade my father to take the money and leave me EdwardBut Edward no longer loves me and it's all my father's fault  SONGMARIAN  Too happy when Edward was kind  My father agreed to our love  No cares e'er disorder'd my mind  I sung as I travers'd the grove  Like the lark's was each note of my song  Serene were my chearful days spent  Whilst eve brought my shepherd along  My shepherdfond love and content  Exit  Sir H  I'll shorten my chace today to devote a few hours to the happiness of this charming girlBut I will first speak to Edward and be certain he has constancy to deserve her  Enter SERVANT  Serv  Your Honor's horses are just on the other side of the gate Sir  Sir H  'Tis very well let somebody go to Edward the young man who writes for me and desire him to be at the hall at twelve  Exeunt  ROBIN and THOMAS appear in and land from the boatEDWARD enters stands pensiveROBIN taps him on the shoulder  Robin  Why so melancholy my lad I'll be bound for it Marian loves you though she seems a little shy at presentDidn't I see her look back at you twenty times last night at folding of the lambs as she walk'd slowly towards home leaning on her father's arm  Edward  I wish I cou'd believe you Robin and surely a mind like hers must be incapable of falsehood  SONGEDWARD  Who can suspect sweet Marian's faith  That hears her softly speak  Or doubt the candid blush of truth  Which mantles on her cheek  Those accents never can deceive  No guile that bosom knows  Pure as th' untainted breath of morn  And chaste as falling snows  Unheeded pass'd the dancing hours  Which saw our growing flame  The grove the dell the fanning breeze  The glow of noon the same  But now no more the dell delights  The grove or fanning breeze  The taste of nature's genuine charms  Demands the mind at ease  Robin  And why shou'dn't your mind be at ease Odd's heart you're enough to spoil all the girls in the parishNow I'll tell you my wayI ax'd Patty what time I shou'd bring the boat and she said as how she had rather come round over the brig so I shall e'en let her come round over the brig  Thomas  And repent it when you have done like enoughI cou'dn't have serv'd my Fanny soBut where will you find two prettier lasses than Patty or Fanny or two truer suitors than Robin and INay for that matter who so happy as we country lads  SONGTHOMAS  How blest our condition how jocund our day  Ye swains can our pleasures be told  To range in sweet order the rows of new hay  To lead the stray'd lamb to the fold  To fetch up the kine for the maiden we love  And guard her from noon's burning beam  To guide her dear steps when she leads thro' the grove  The heifer which pants for the stream  To carry her pail when with milk it o'erflows  To wait while she rests on the stile  To gather the kingcup the woodbine and rose  To make her a posy the while  'Tis Fanny the lovely who causes my smart  'Tis she does all maidens excel  If you ask her dear name who has conquer'd my heart  'Tis Fanny the pride of the dell  'Tis Fanny sweet Fanny  'Tis Fanny sweet Fanny the pride of the dell  Robin  Here comes pretty Marian Don't be shy nor mind her vagaries sit down on the stile  and make as if you did not see herThomas and I will step into the house the while  Exeunt ROBIN and THOMAS into the house  EDWARD sits on the stile and plays on the flute  Enter MARIAN  She goes softly up to him throws flowers at him from her basketEDWARD turnsshe stops looks confused he runs to her and takes her hand  Edward  Do you love me still Marian  Marian  Do you ask me Edward  hiding her face with her apron  My father wants me to marry Robin because he has ten acres of land besides the ferry and a vote in the country and milks four cows but I won't marry Robin nor anybody but Edward  Edward  How could I be so unjust Marian  Marian  My father values wealth but for me the kindness of my honoured godmother is only welcome in the hope of sharing it with Edward  looking down and playing with the strings of her hat  Edward  I know my Marian's generous bosom well therefore though I was so unjust to doubt her constancy I never had the meanness to suspect any acquisition of fortune could occasion it  Enter ROBIN from the House  Robin  Yonder's your father Marian hobbling along towards the Grangewhip over the stilego the nearest way and be at home before him  Exit MARIAN led off by EDWARD  Reenter EDWARD with THOMAS  Robin takes EDWARD's hand  Didn't I tell you my lad that Marian loved youWhy you've got quite another face man  Edward  How different looks the whole scene around me Nature now resumes all her charms  SONGEDWARD  Ye happy pairs sincere and kind  'Tis here you taste each joy refin'd  Fair truth and love delight to dwell  At yonder cottage on the dell  Light as the fairy step at morn  Swift passing o'er th' unbending corn  All other pleasures weakly move  The heart awake to generous love  How dear sweet Marian's artless sighs  Hers the mild eloquence of eyes  When constancy's allcheering ray  Drives ev'ry jealous thought away  Far hence be doubt and tender fears  How blest the life which love endears  When truth informs the glowing cheek  O Love thy transports who can speak  Enter SERVANT whispers EDWARD and exit  Robin  Where did you leave the lasses Thomas  Thomas  In the market but they'll soon be here they only stop at the cherryholt on the other side of the water to get some fresh cherries and posies to sell at the fair William and I promised to meet them at the brig  Robin  You see Thomas every one to his liking Edward is inveigled by Marian's brown  locksYou love Fanny the Pindar's daughter and I'm in love with Patty Clover we fancied one another when bairnsI lik'd her afore I knew what liking was  SONGROBIN  When little on the villagegreen  We play'd I learnt to love her  She seem'd to me some fairy queen  So light tripp'd Patty Clover  With every simple childish art  I try'd each day to move her  The cherry pluck'd the bleeding heart  To give to Patty Clover  The fairest flowers to deck her breast  I chose an infant lover  I stole the goldfinch from its nest  To sing to Patty Clover  Exeunt through parkgate  Robin  Thomas let's have a drink 'tis a main good thing after a walkI've a brave barrel of ale just broach'd for the fairCome Thomas  Exeunt into house  Enter Sir HENRY and EDWARD  Edward  As you command me to speak Sir your tenants have but one wish that you wou'd bring down a lady to replace your honor'd mother  Sir H  Be assured Edward I shall marry the moment I am tired of being a batchelor in the meantime my tenants may be perfectly easy  pleasure without remorse the rose without the thorn is my pursuitYet I cannot convince the girls of this even the lively Patty whom I shou'd think less apprehensive if she meets me alone darts from me with the swiftness of a lapwing she reminds me of that beautiful Ode of Horace which a very slight alteration makes exactly to my purpose  AIRSir HENRY  Patty flies me like a fawn  Which thro' some sequester'd lawn  Panting seeks the mother deer  Not without a panic fear  Of the gently breathing breeze  And the motion of the trees  O'er the cool sequester'd lawn  Patty flies me like a fawn  If the curling leaves but shake  If a lizard stir the brake  Frighted it begins to freeze  Trembling both at heart and knees  Thus alarm'd with causeless fear  Fancy paints a lover near  Whilst along the dewy lawn  Patty flies me like a fawn  Enter ROBIN with a jug and THOMAS at the door bowing  Sir H  Come here RobinWhat time does your little fair on the green beginI intend to be there and give the girls fairings  Robin  At one o'clock your Honor and ends at milking time We have been drinking your Honor's good health  shews the jug  Sir H  I'll return your compliment Robin I am this moment returned from the chace and  shall have no objection to a draught of your family liquor  Robin  How kind your Honor is  To EDWARD  One may know his Honor to be a gentleman born by his not having a morsel of prideI remember hearing his Honor bear a bob once in the very ballad we were going to sing  Sir H  You shall hear me again RobinI wish you to call at the hall about two o'clock Edward as I have something particular to say to you  QUARTETTO  Sir HENRY EDWARD ROBIN and THOMAS  Sir HENRY  Truth exalts the generous soul

love my Robin dearly  More than holidays or ease  Yet when lads will court me chearly  Sure it is no harm to please  EDWARD  Fond I mark the swell of pleasure  When I see the tender dove  Fluttering
