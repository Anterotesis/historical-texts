impertinent creature is breeding that is pure it will soon reach my Lady's ear I warrant  Enter  John  with Letters  Well John ever a letter for me  John  No Mrs Betty but here's one for Miss Constantia  Bet  Give it mehummy Lady's hand  John  And here is one which the postman says is for my young master but it is a strange direction  reads  To Charles Egerton Esq  Bet  O yesyesthat is for Master Charles John for he has drop his fathers name of Mac Sycophant and has taken up that of EgertonThe Parliament has ordered it  John  The Parliament pry'thee why so Mrs Betty  Bet  Why you must know John that my Lady his mother was an Egerton by her father she stole a match with our old master for which all her family on both sides have hated Sir Pertinax and the whole crew of the Mac Sycophants ever since  John  Except Master Charles Mrs Betty  Bet  O they doat upon him for tho' he be a Mac Sycophant he's the pride of all my Lady's familyAnd so John my Lady's uncle Sir Stanley Egerton dying an old batchelor and as I said before mortally hating our old master and the whole crew of the Mac Sycophants lest his whole estate to Master Charles who was his Godson but on condition tho' that he shou'd drop his fathers name of Mac Sycophant and take up that of Egerton and that is the reason John why the Parliament has made him change his name  John  I am glad that Master Charles has got the estate however for he is a sweet tempered gentleman  Bet  As ever lived but come John as I know you love Miss Constantia and are fond of an opportunity of speaking to her I will make you happy you shall carry her letter to her  John  Shall I Mrs Betty I am very much obliged to you where is she  Bet  In the housekeeper's room settling the desertGive me Mr Egerton's letter I will lay it on the table in his dressing room I see it's from his brother Mr Sandy so now go and deliver your letter to your sweetheart John  John  That I will Mrs Betty and I am much obliged to you for the savour of letting me carry it to her for tho' she should never have me yet I shall always love her and wish to be near her she is so sweet a creatureYour servant Mrs Betty I will kiss the letter for her sakesweet sweet dear Miss ConstantiaO if I was but kissing her hand Betty now instead of this letter how happy shou'd I beYour servant Mrs Betty  Exit John  Bet  Your servant Johnha ha ha poor fellow he perfectly doats on her and daily follows her  about with nosegays and fruit and the first of every thing in the season ay and my young Master Charles too he is in as bad a way as the gardinerin short every body loves her and that is one reason why I hate herfor my part I wonder what the deuce the men see in hera creature that was taken in for charityI am sure she is not so handsomeI wish she was out of the family once if she was I might then stand a chance of being my Lady's favourite myself ay and perhaps of getting one of my young Masters for a sweetheartor at least the ChaplainBut as to him there would be no such great catch if I should get himI will try for him however and my first step shall be to let the Doctor know all I have discovered about Constantia's intrigues with her spark at HadleyYes that will do for the Doctor loves to talk with me and always smiles and jokes with me    laughs    he hehe loves to hear me talk too and I verily believe he he he that he has a sneaking kindness for me besides this story will make him have a good opinion of my honesty and that I am sure will be one step towards itO bless me here he comes and my young Master with himI'll watch an opportunity to speak to him as soon as he is alone for I will blow her up I am resolved as great a favourite and as cunning as she is  Exit  Enter  Egerton  in great warmth and emotion  Sidney  following as in earnest conversation  Sid  Nay dear Charles but why are you so impetuous Why do you break from me so abruptly  Egert  I have done SirYou have refusedI have nothing more to say upon the subjectI am satisfied  Sid    Spoke with a glow of tender friendship    Come come correct this warmth it is the only weak ingredient in your nature and you ought to watch it carefully if I am wrong I will submit without reserve but consider the nature of your request and how it would affect me From your earliest Youth  your Father has honoured me with the care of your Education and the general conduct of your mind and however singular and morose his behaviour may be towards others to me he has ever been respectful and liberal I am now under his roof tooand because I will not abet an unwarrantable passion by an abuse of my sacred character in marrying you beneath your rank and in direct opposition to your Father's hopes and happinessyou blameyou angrily break from me and call me unkind  Egert    With kindness and conviction    Dear Sidney for my warmth I stand condemned but for my marriage with Constantia I think I can justify it upon every principle of filial duty honour and worldly prudence  Sid  Only make that appear Charles and you know you may command me  Egert  I am sensible how unworthy it appears in a Son to descant on the unamiable passions of a Father but as we are alone and friends I cannot help observing in my own defence that when a Father will not allow the use of reason to any of his Familywhen his pursuit of greatness makes him a slave abroadonly to be a tyrant at homewhen his narrow partiality to Scotland on every trivial occasion provokes him to enmity even with his Wife and Children only because they dare give a national preference where they think it is most justly dueand when merely to gratify his own ambition he would marry his Son into a family he detests    With great warmth    Sure Sidney a Son thus circumstanced from the dignity of human nature and the feelings of a loving heart has a right not only to protest against the blindness of the Parent but to pursue those measures that virtue and happiness point out  Sid  The violent temper of Sir Pertinax I own cannot on many occasions be defendedbut still your intended alliance with Lord Lumbercourt  Egert  O contemptible A trifling quaint haughty voluptuous servile toolthe mere lackey of party and corruption who for the prostitution of near  thirty years and the ruin of a noble fortune has had the despicable satisfaction and the infamous honour of being kicked up and kicked down kicked in and kicked outjust as the insolence compassion or conveniency of leaders predominated and now being forsaken by all parties his whole political consequence amounts to the power of franking a letter and the right honourable priviledge of not paying a Tradesman's bill  Sid  Well but dear Charles you are not to wed my Lord but his daughter  Egert  Who is as disagreeable for a companion as her Father is for a friend or an ally  Sid  Ha ha ha What her Scotch accent I suppose offends you  Egert  Noupon my honournot in the least I think it entertaining in her but were it otherwise in decencyand indeed in national affection being a Scotchman myself I can have no objection to her on that accountbesides she is my near relation  Sid  So I understandbut how comes Lady Rodolpha who I find was born in England to be bred in Scotland  Egert  From the dotage of an old formal obstinate stiff rich Scotch Grandmother who upon a promise of leaving this Grandchild all her fortune which is very considerable wou'd have the Girl sent to her to Scotland when she was but a year old and there has she been bred up ever since with this old Lady in all the vanity and unlimitted indulgence that fondness and admiration could bestow on a spoiled Child a fancied Beauty and a pretended Wit  Sid  O you are too severe on her  Egert  I do not think so Sidney for she seems a being expressly fashioned by nature to figure in these days of levity and dissipation her spirits are inexhaustible her parts strong and lively with a sagacity that discerns and a talent not unhappy in painting the weak side of whatever comes before herBut what raises her merit to the highest pitch in the laughing world is her boundless vanity in the exertion of those  talents which often renders herself much more ridiculous than the most whimsical of the characters she exposesAnd is this a woman fit to make my happiness This the partner that Sidney would recommend to me for life To you who best know me I appeal  Sid  Why Charles it is a delicate pointunfit for me to determinebesides your Father has set his mind upon the match  Egert    Impatiently    All that I knowbut still I ask and insist upon your candid judgment is she the kind of Woman that you think cou'd possibly contribute to my happinessI beg you will give me an explicit answer  Sid  The subject is disagreeableBut since I must speakI do not think she is  Egert  I know you do not and I am sure you never will advise the match  Sid  I never didI never will  Egert    With a start of joy    You make me happywhich I assure you I never could be with your judgment against me on this point  Sid  And yet Charles give me leave to observe that Lady Rodolpha with all her ridiculous laughing vanity has a goodness of heart and a kind of vivacity that not only entertains but upon seeing her two or three times improves upon you and when her torrent of spirits abates and she condescends to converse gravely you will really like her  Egert  Why aye she is sprightly goodhumoured and tho' whimsical and often too high in her colouring of characters and in the trifling business of the idle world yet I think she has principles and a good heart but in a partner for life Sidney you know your own preceptyour own judgment affection capricious in its nature must have something even in the external mannersnay in the very mode not only of beauty but virtue itself which both heart and judgment must approve or our happiness in that delicate point cannot be lasting  Sid  I grant it  Egert  And that mode that amiable essential I never can meet with but in ConstantiaYou sigh  Sid  No I only wish that Constantia had a fortune equal to yours but pray Charles suppose I had been so indiscreet as to have agreed to marry you to Constantia would she have consented think you  Egert  That I cannot say positively but I suppose so  Sid  Did you never speak to her upon that subject then  Egert  In general terms only never directly asked her consent in form but I will this very moment for I have no asylum from my Father's arbitrary design but my Constantia's armsPray do not stir from henceI will return instantly I know she will submit to your advice and I am sure you will persuade her to my wish as my life my peace my earthly happiness depend upon my Constantia  Exit  Sid  Poor Charles He little dreams that I love Constantiabut to what degree I knew not myself till he importuned me to join their handsYes I love but must not be a rivalfor he is dear to me as fraternal friendshipmy benefactor my friend and that name is sacred It is our better self and ought to be preferredFor the man who gratifies his passions at the expence of his friend's happiness wants but a head to contrive for he has a heart capable of the blackest vice  Enter  Betty  raming up to him  Bet  I beg pardon Sir for my intrusion I hope Sir I do not disturb you  Sid  Not in the least Mrs Betty  Bet  I humbly hope you will excuse me Sirbut I wanted to break my mind to your honour about a scruplethat lies upon my conscienceand indeed I shou'd not have presumed to trouble you Sir but that I know you are my young Master's friendand indeed a friend to the whole family  runs up to him and curtseys  very low  for to give you your due Sir you are as good a preacher as ever went into a pulpit  Sid  Ha ha ha Do you think so Mrs Betty  Bet  Ay in truth do Iand as good a Gentleman too as ever came into a family and one that never gives a servant a hard word nor that does any one an ill turn neither behind one's back nor before one's face  Sid  Ha ha hawhy you are a mightty well spoken woman Mrs Betty and I am extremely beholden to you for your good character of me  Bet  Indeed Sir it is no more than what you deserve and what all the servants say of you  Sid  I am much obliged to them Mrs BettyBut pray what are your commands with me  Bet  Why I will tell you Sirto be sure I am but a servant as a body may say and every tub should stand upon its own bottom but  she holds him familiarly looks about cautiously and speaks in a low familiar tone of great secrecy  my young Master is now in the China room in close conference with Miss ConstantiaI know what they are aboutbut that is no business of mineand therefore I made bold to listen a little because you know Sir one would be sure before one took away any body's good name  Sid  Very true Mrs Bettyvery true indeed  Bet  Oh heavens forbid that I should take away any young woman's good name unless I had good reason for itBut Sir if I am in this place aliveas I listened with my ear close to the doorI heard my young Master ask Miss Constantiathe plain marriage question upon which I started and tremblednay my very conscience stirred within me so that I I I cou'd not help peeping thro' the keyhole  Sid  Ha ha haAnd so your conscience made you peep thro' the keyhole Mrs BettyHa  Bet  It did indeed Sir and then I saw my young Master down upon his knees and what do you think he was doingLord bless uskissing her hand as if he would eat it and protesting and assuring her he knew that you Sir would consent to the matchand  then O my good Sir the tears ran down her cheeks as fast  Sid  Ay  Bet  Crying tenderly  They did indeed Sir I wou'd not tell your reverence a lie for the world  Sid  I believe it Mrs Betty I believe it and what did Constantia say to all this  Bet  Sneering severely and shaking her head  O she is fly enoughshe looks as if butter would not melt in her mouth but all is not gold that glistenssmooth water you know runs deepest  speaks this with sorrow  I am sorry my young Master makes himself such a fool very sorry indeed but umhatake my word for it  he  is not the man  sneeringly  for tho' she looks as modest as a maid at a christening  besitating  Yet awhen sweethearts meet in the dusk of the eveningand stay together a whole hour in a dark groveandaembraceand kissand weep at partingwhy then you know Sirit is easy to guess all the rest  Sid  Why did Constantia meet any body in this manner  Bet  Starting with surprise  O Heavens I beg Sir you will not misapprehend me for I assure you I do not believe they did any harmthat isnot in the groveat least not when I was thereand she may be honestly married for aught I knowO lud Sir I would not say an ill thing of Miss Constantia for all the worldfor to besure she is a good creature'tis true my Lady took her in for charityand indeed has bred her up to the music and figuresay and to reading all the books about Homerand Paradiseand Gods and Devilsand every thing in the worldas if she had been a Duchessbut some people are born with luck in their mouthsand then as the saying is you may throw them into the sea  deports herself most affectedly  but if I had had dancing masters and music and French monsieurs to teach  me  smiles coquets and puts on important airs of affectation  I believe I might read the globes and the maps and have danced and have been as clever as other folks  Sid  Ha ha haNo doubt of it Mrs Betty no doubt in the leastBut Mrs Betty you mentioned something of a dark walkabout kissinga sweetheartand Constantia  Bet  O lud Sir I don't know any thing of the mattershe may be very honest for ought I knowI only say that they did meet in the dark walk and all the servants are laughing and tittering and constantly observing that Miss Constantia wears her stays very looselooks very paleis sick in a morning and after dinnerand as sure as my name is Betty Hint something has happened that I won't name but nine months hence a certain person in this family may ask me to stand Godmother for I think I know what's what when I see it as well as another  Sid  No doubt you do Mrs Betty  Bet  I do indeed Sir and  she cries turns up her eyes and acts a most friendly devout hypocrisy  I am very sorry for Miss Constantia I never thought she would have taken such coursesfor in truth I love her as if she were my own sisterand tho' all the servants say she is breeding yet for my part I don't believe itbut one must speak according to one's conscience you know Sir  Sid  I see you do Mrs Betty  Bet  I do indeed Sir and so your servant Sir  going away and returning  But I hope your Worship will not mention my name in this business or that you had any item from me  Sid  I shall not Mrs Betty  Bet  For indeed Sir I am no busybodynor do I love fending and provingand I assure you Sir I hate all tittling and tattling and gossipping and backbiting and taking away a young person's character be her ever so bad  Sid  I observe you do Mrs Betty  Bet  I do indeed Sir I am the farthest from it in the world  Sid  I dare say you are  Bet  I am indeed Sir and so your humble servant  Sid  Your servant Mrs Betty  Bet  Aside in great exultation  So I see he believes every word I saythat's charmingI will do her business for her I am resolved  Exit  Sid  What can this ridiculous creature meanby her dark walkher private sparkher kissingand all her slanderous insinuations against Constantia whose conduct is as unblameable as innocence itself I see envy is as malignant in a paltry waiting wench as in the vainest or most ambitious Lady of the Court It is always a most infallible mark of the basest nature and merit in the lowest as in the highest station must feel the shafts of envy's constant agents falsehood and slander  Enter  Sam  Sam  Sir Mr Egerton and Miss Constantia desire to speak with you in the China room  Sid  Very well Sam  Exit Sam  I will not see themWhat is to be done Inform his Father of his intended marriageNo that must not befor the overbearing temper and ambitious policy of Sir Pertinax would exceed all bounds of moderation He has banished one Son already only for daring to differ from his judgment concerning the merits of Scotch and English historiansBut this young Man must not marry Constantiawou'd his Mother were hereshe I suppose knows nothing of his indiscretion but she shall the moment she comes hitherI know it will offend himno matter it is our duty to offend when the offence saves the Man we love from a precipitate action which the world must condemn and his own heart perhaps upon reflection for ever repentYes I must discharge the duty of my function and a friend tho' I am sure to lose the Man whom I intend to serve  Exit  ACT II  Enter  Egerton  and  Constantia  Const  MR Sidney is not here Sir  Egert  I assure you I left him here and begged that he wou'd stay till I returned  Const  His prudence you see Sir has made him retire therefore we had better defer the subject till he is presentIn the mean time Sir I hope you will permit me to mention an affair that has greatly alarmed and perplexed me I suppose you guess what it is  Egert  I do not upon my word  Const  That's a little strangeYou know Sir that you and Mr Sidney did me the honour of breakfasting with me this morning in my little study  Egert  We had that happiness Madam  Const  Just after you left me opening my book of accounts which lay in the drawer of the reading desk to my great surprise I there found this case of jewels containing a most elegant pair of earrings and a necklace of great value and two bank bills in this pocketbook the mystery of which I presume Sir you can explain  Egert  I can  Const  They are of your conveying then  Egert  They were Madam  Const  I assure you they startled and alarmed me  Egert  I hope it was a kind alarm such as blushing Virtue feels when with her hand she gives her heart and last consent  Const  It was not indeed Sir  Egert  Do not say so Constantiacome be kind at once my peace and worldly bliss depend upon this moment  Const  What wou'd you have me do  Egert  What love and virtue dictate  Const  O Sir experience but too severely proves that such unequal matches as ours never produce aught but contempt and anger in parents censure from the world and a long train of sorrow and repentance in the wretched parties which is but too often entailed upon their hapless issue  Egert  But that Constantia cannot be our condition for my fortune is independent and ample equal to luxury and splendid folly I have a right to choose the partner of my heart  Const  But I have not SirI am a dependant on my Ladya poor forsaken helpless orphan your benevolent mother found me took me to her bosom and there supplied my parental loss with every tender care indulgent dalliance and with all the sweet persuasion that maternal fondness religious precepts polished manners and hourly example cou'd administer She fostered me  weeps  and shall I now turn viper and with black ingratitude sting the tender heart that thus has cherished me Shall I seduce her house's heir and kill her peaceNo tho' I loved to the mad extreme of female fondnesstho' every worldly bliss that woman's vanity or man's ambition cou'd desire followed the indulgence of my love and all the contempt and misery of this life the denial of that indulgence I would discharge my duty to my benefactress my earthly guardian my more than parent  Egert  My dear Constantia your prudence your gratitude and the cruel virtue of your selfdenial do but increase my love my admiration and my misery  Const  Sir I must beg you will give me leave to return these bills and jewels  Egert  Pray do not mention themSure my kindness and esteem may be indulged so far without suspicion or reproach I beg you will accept of them nay I insist  Const  I have done Sirmy station here is to obeyI know they are the gifts of a virtuous heart and mine shall convert them to the tenderest and most grateful use  weeps  Egert  Hark I hear a coachit is my Fatherdear girl retire and compose yourselfI will send Sidney and my Lady to you and by their judgment we will be directedWill that satisfy you  Const  I can have no will but my Lady'swith your leave I will retireI wou'd not see her in this confusion  Egert  Dear girl

own room O she is here Sir  Exit Sam  Enter Lady  Mac Sycophant  L Mac  In great confusion and distress  Dear child I am glad to see you why did you not come to town yesterday to attend the levee Your Father is incensed to the uttermost at your not being there  Egert  In great warmth  Madam it is with extreme regret I tell you that I can no longer be a slave to his temper his politics and his scheme of marrying me to this woman Therefore you had better consent at once to my going out of the kingdom and to my taking Constantia with me for without her I never can be happy  L Mac  As you regard my peace or your own character I beg you will not be guilty of so rash a stepYou promised me you would never marry her without my consent I will open it to your FatherPray dear Charles be ruled let me prevail Here he comes I will get out of his waybut I beg Charles while he is in this ill humour that you will not oppose him let him say what he willwhen his passion is a little cool I will return and try to bring him to reasonbut pray do not thwart him  Egert  Madam I will not  Exit L Mac  Enter Sir  Pertinax  in great haughtiness and anger  Sir Pert  Weel Sir vary weel vary weelAre not you a very fine fellow a hagh  Enter  Tomlins  What want you Sir  Tom  Sir the groom is come backhe has been as far as Hammersmith and the turnpike men and every person upon the road are sure that Lord Lumbercourt has not passed by this day  Sir Pert  Let them take the chesnut gelding and return to town directly and enquire at my Lord's house whether he is at home or if they know what is become of himand do you hearthe moment that Counsellor Plausible and Mr Serjeant Eitherside arrive let me know it  Exit Tomlins  Weel Sir pray what do you think of yourself are not you a fine sparkare not you a fine spark I saySo you would not come up to the levee  Egert  Sir I beg your pardon but III was not very wellbesides I did not think that my presence there was necessary  Sir Pert  Snaps him up  Sir it was necessaryI tauld ye it was necessaryand Sir I must now tell you that the whole tenor of your conduct is most offensive  Egert  I am sorry you think so SirI am sure I do not intend to offend you  Sir Pert  I care not what you intend Sir I tell you you do offendwhat is the meaning of this conductneglect the leveeneglecting the levee is such a contempt and such an ignorance of the world that sdeath Sir yourWhat is your reason I say for thus neglecting the levee and disobeying my commands  Egerton bows  None of your bowing and sighing Sir give me an immediate answer  Egert  With a stifled filial resentment  Sir I own I am not used to levees nor do I know how to dispose of myself or what to say or do in such a station  Sir Pert  With a proud angry resentment  Zounds Sir do you not see what others do gentle and simple temporal and spiritual Lords Members Judges Generals and Bishops aw crouding burstling pushing foremost untill intul the middle of the circle and there waiting watching and striving to catch a luock or a smile fra the great Monwhich they meet with an amicable risibility of aspect a modest cadence of body and a conciliating cooperation of the whole mon which expresses an officious promptitude for his service and indicates that they luock upon themselves as the suppliant appendage of his power and the inlisted Swiss of his political fortuneThis Sir is what you ought to doand this Sir is what I never once omitted for these five and thirty yearslet wha wou'd be minister  Egert  Aside  Contemptible  Sir Pert  What is that ye mutter Sir  Egert  Only a slight reflection Sir not relative to you  Sir Pert  Sir your absenting yourself from the levee at this juncture is suspeecious it is luocked upon as a kind of disaffection and aw your country men are highly offended with your conduct for Sir they do not look upon you as a friend or a wellwisher to Scotland or to Scotchmen  Egert  With a quick warmth  Then Sir they wrong me I assure you but pray Sir in what particular can I be charged either with coldness or offence to my country  Sir Pert  Why Sir ever since your mother's uncle Sir Stanly Egerton left you this three thousand pounds a year and that you have in compliance with his will taken up the name of Egerton they think you are growing proud that you have estranged yourself fra the Mac Sycophantshave associated with your mother's familywith the opposeetion and with those who do not wish weel to Scotlandbesides Sir in a conversation the other day after dinner at your cousin Campbell M'Kenzie's before a whole table full of your ayn relations did you not publicly wish a total extinguishment  of aw party and of aw national distinctions whatever relative to the three kingdoms  With great anger  And was that a prudent wish before so many of your ain countrymen and be damn'd to you Or was it a filial language to hold before me  Egert  Sir with your pardon I cannot think it unfilial or imprudent  with a most patriotic warmth  I own I do wish most ardently wish for a total extinction of all parties particularly that those of English Irish and Scotch might never more be brought into contest or competition unless like loving brothers in general emulation for one common cause  Sir Pert  How Sir do you persist What would you banish aw party and distinction between English Irish and your ain countrymen  Egert  With great dignity of spirit  I would Sir  Sir Pert  Then damn ye Sir ye are nai true ScotAy Sir you may luock as angry as you wuolbut again I sayye are nai true Scot  Egert  Your pardon Sir I think he is the true Scot and the true citizen who wishes equal justice to the merit and demerit of every subject of Great Britain amongst whom I know but of two distinctions  Sir Pert  Weel Sir and what are those What are those  Egert  The knave and the honest man  Sir Pert  Pshaw ridiculousnonsensestuffall idle hacknied opposition cant and nonsense  Egert  And he Sir who makes any other be him of the North or of the South of the East or of the West in place or out of place is an enemy to the whole and to the virtues of humanity  Sir Pert  Ay Sir this is your brother's impudent doctrinefor the which I have banished him for ever fra my presence my heart and my fortuneSir I will have nai Son of mine because truly he has been educated in an English seminary presume under the mask of public candor to speak against his native land or my principles SirScotsmenScotsmenSir wherever they meet throughout the globe should unite and stick together as it were in a poleetical phalanx  Egert  That is a severe judgment Sir and according to my observation and indeed my frequent experience consistent neither with truth nor the indiscriminate affection of impartial nature  Sir Pert  How Sir not consistent with truth  Egert  Not in my opinion Sir for I who am a Scotchman as well as you have met with as warm friendships and as many too out of Scotland as ever I met with in it  Sir Pert  Sir I do not believe youI do not believe youBut Sir you have a saucy lurking prejudice against your ain country you hate ityes your mother her family and your brother Sir have aw the same disaffected rankling and by that and their politics together they will be the ruin of you themselves and aw' who connect with them however nai mair of that now I weell talk at large with ye aboot that business anonIn the mean time Sir notwithstanding your contempt of my advice and your disobedience till my commands I will convince you of my paternal attention till your welfare by my management with this voluptuarythis Lord Lumbercourt whose daughter you are to marryye ken Sir that the fellow has been my patron these three and tharty years  Egert  True Sir  Sir Pert  Vary weeland now Sir you see by his prodigality he is become my dependant and accordingly I have made my bargain with him The dee'l a baubee he has in the world but what comes thro' these clutches for his whole estate which has three impleecit boroughs on it markis now in my custody at nurse the which estate on my paying off his debts and allowing him a liferent of seven thousand pounds per annum is to be made over till me for my life and at my death it is to descend till ye and your issueThe peerage of Lumbercourt ye ken will follow of courseSo Sir ye see by this marriage there are three impleecit boroughs the whole patrimoney of Lumbercourt and a peerage at one slapWhy it is a  strokea hita hitZounds Sir a man may live a century and not make sic another hit again  Egert  It is a very advantageous bargain no doubt SirBut what will my Lord's family say to it  Sir Pert  Why man he cares not if his family were aw at the dee'l so that his luxury be but gratifiedOnly let him have a race horse till feed his vanity his polite blacklegs to advise him in his matches on the turf at cards and at tenis and his harridan till drink drams wee him and in her drunken hysterics to scrat his face and burn his periwig or let him have a dozen of his dependants and half a dozen of his Swiss borough voters sit up all night drinking bumpers of success to the oppositionand double bumpers of destruction to the ministry and then Sir the fellow has aw that he wants and aw that he wishes in this world or the next  Enter  Tomlins  Tom  Lady Rodolpha is come Sir  Sir Pert  And my Lord  Tom  Sir he is about a mile or two

lucky our first step then must be to take her advice in our conduct so as to keep our faithers in the dark till we can bit off some measure that wee'll wind them aboot till oor ain purpose and the common interest of our ain passion  Egert  You are very right Madam for should my father suspect my brother's affection for your Ladyship or mine for Constantia there is no guessing what would be the consequence his whole happiness depends upon this bargain with my Lord for it gives him the possession of three boroughs and those Madam are much dearer to him than the happiness of his children I am sorry to say it but to gratify his political rage he would sacrifice every social tie that is dear to friend or family  Exeunt  ACT IV  Enter Sir  Pertinax  and Counsellor  Plausible  Sir Pert  NOnocome away Counsellor Plausiblecome away I saylet them chew upon itlet them  chew upon itWhy Counsellor did you ever hear so impartinant so meddling and so obstinate a blockhead as that Serjeant Eitherside Confound the fellow he has put me oot of aw temper  Plaus  He is very positive indeed Sir Pertinax and no doubt was intemperate and rudeBut Sir Pertinax I would not break off the match notwithstanding for certainly even without the boroughs it is a very advantageous bargain to you and your son  Sir Pert  But zoons Plausible do you think I will gee up the nomineetion till three boroughs Why I would rather gee him twenty aw thirty thoosand pounds in any either point of the bargain especially at this juncture when votes are likely to become invaluable Why mon if a certain affair comes on they'll rise above five hundred per cent  Plaus  You judge very rightly Sir Pertinax but what shall we do in this case For Mr Serjeant insists that you positively agreed to my Lords having the nomination to the three boroughs during his own life  Sir Pert  Why yes in the first sketch of the agreement I believe I did consent but at that time mon my Lords affairs did not appear to be half so desperate ass I now find they turn ootSir he must be acqueese in whatever I demandFor I hai gotten him into sic an hobble that he canno exeest without me  Plaus  No doubt Sir Pertinax you have him absolutely in your power  Sir Pert  Vary weel and ought not a mon to make his vantage of it  Plaus  No doubt you oughtno matter of doubtBut Sir Pertinax there is a secret spring in this business that you do not seem to perceive and which I am afraid governs the matter respecting these boroughs  Sir Pert  What spring do you mean Counsellor  Plaus  Why Serjeant Eitherside I have some reason to think that my Lord is tied down by some means or other to bring the Serjeant in the very first vacancy for one of those boroughsnow that I believe is the  sole motive why the Serjeant is so very strenuous that my Lord should keep the boroughs in his own power fearing that you might reject him for some man of your own  Sir Pert  Odds wounds and deeth Plausibleye are cleeverdeevilish cleeverby the blood ye hai hit upon the vary streeng that hais made aw this discordI see itI see it nowBut haudhaudbide a wee bita wee bit monI hai a thought come in till my headYas I think noow Plausible wee a little care in our negotiation that this vary string properly tuned may be still made to produce the harmony we wish for yes yes I hai it This Serjeant I see understonds business and if I am not mistaken knows how till take a hint  Plaus  O nobody better Sir Pertinaxnobody better  Sir Pert  Why then Plausible the short road is always the best wee sie a mon ye must even come up to his mark at yeance and assure him frae me that I weell secure him a seat for yean of these vary boroughs  Plaus  O that will do Sir Pertinaxthat will do I'll answer for it  Sir Pert  And further I beg ye weell let him know that I think myself oblig'd till conseeder him in this affair ass acting for me ass weell ass for my Lord ass a common friend till baith and for the service he has already done us make my special compliments till him and pray let this amiacable bit of paper be my faithfull advocate till convince him of what my gratitude further intends for his great  gives a bank bill  equity in adjusting this agreement betweext my Lords family and mine  Plaus  Ha ha ha Sir Pertinax upon my word this is nobleay ay this is an eloquent bit of paper indeed  Sir Pert  Maister Plausible in aw human dealings the most effectual method is that of ganging at yeance till the vary bottom of a mons heart for if we expact that men should serve us we must first win their affections by serving themOh here they baith come  Enter  Enter Lord  Lumbercourt  and Serjeant  Eitherside  L Lum  My dear Sir Pertinax what could provoke you to break off this business so abruptly You are really wrong in the point and if you will give yourself time to recollect you will find that my having the nomination to the boroughs for my life was a preliminary articleand I appeal to Mr Serjeant Eitherside here whether I did not always understand so  Serj Either  I assure you Sir Pertinax that in all his Lordship's conversation with me upon this business and in his positive instructions both he and I always understood the nomination to be in my Lord  durante vitae  Sir Pert  Why then my Lord to shorten the dispute all I can say in answer to your Lordship is that there has been a total mistake between us in that point and therefore the treaty must end hereI give it upOh I wash my hands of it for ever  Plaus  Well but Gentlemen Gentlemen a little patiencesure this mistake somehow or other may be rectified Mr Serjeant prithee let you and I step into the next room by ourselves and reconsider the clause relative to the boroughs and try if we cannot hit upon a medium that will be agreeable to both parties  Serj Either  With great warmth  Mr Plausible I have considered the clause fully and am entirely master of the question My Lord cannot give up the point without an equivalent  Plaus  Sir Pertinax will you permit Mr Serjeant and me to retire a few moments to reconsider the points  Sir Pert  Wee all my heart and saul Maister Plausibleainy thing till accommodate your Lordship ainy

to say however  Serj Either  Nay I will wait on Mr Plausible my Lord with all my heart but I am sure I cannot suggest the shadow of a reason for altering my present opinionImpossibleImpossible  Plaus  Well well do not be positive Mr Serjeant do not be positiveI am sure reason and your client's conveniency will always make you alter your opinion  Serj Either  Ay ay reason and my client's conveniency Mr Plausible will always controul my opinion depend upon itAy ay there you are rightSir I attend you  Exeunt Lawyers  Sir Pert  I am sorry my Lord extremely sorry indeed that this mistake has happened

Pertinax  Sir Pert  Not aboot the boroughs my Lord for those I do not mind a bawbee but aboot your distrust of my friendship why do you think now I appeal to your ain breast my Lord do you think my Lord that I should ever hai refused or slighted your Lordship's nomination to these boroughs  L Lum  Why really I don't think you would Sir Pertinax but we must be directed by our Lawyers you know  Sir Pert  Hah my Lord Lawyers are a dangerous species of animals till hai depandence onthey are awways starting punctilios and diffeecultys among friends why my dear Lord it is their interest that aw mankind should be at variance for disagreement is the vary manure wee which they enrich and fatten the land of leeteegation and as they find that that constantly promotes the best crop depend upon it they will always be sure to lay it on as thick as they can  L Lum  Come come my dear Sir Pertinax you must not be angry with Mr Serjeant for his insisting so  strongly on this pointfor those boroughs you know are my sheet anchor  Sir Pert  I know it my Lordand as an instance of my promptness to study and my acquiescence till your Lordship's inclinations ass I see that this Serjeant Eitherside wishes you weell and ye him I think now he wou'd be as gude a mon to be returned for yean of these boroughs ass could be pitched upon and ass such I humbly recommend him to your Lordship's consideration  L Lum  Why my dear Sir Pertinax to tell you the truth I have already promised himhe must be in for one of them and that is one reason why I insisted so strenuouslyHe must be in  Sir Pert  And why notOdzoons why notIs nai your word a fiat and wall it not be always so to meAre ye nai my friendmy patronand are we nai by this match of our cheeldren to be united intill one interest  L

aboot these paltry boroughs but conclude the agreement at yeance just as it stands otherwise there must be new writings drawn new consultation of Lawyers new objections and delays will arise creditors

Westminsterhall couldIt shall stand as it isYes it shall be settled your own way for your interest and mine are the same I see plainly  Sir Pert  No doubt of it my Lord  L Lum  O here the Lawyers

have convinced himI have laid such arguments before Mr Serjeant as were irresistable  Serj Either  He has indeed my Lordbesides as Sir Pertinax gives his honour that your Lordship's nomination shall be sacredly observed why upon a nearer review of the whole affair I think it will be the wiser measure to conclude the agreement just as it is drawn  L Lum  I am very glad you think so Mr Serjeant because that is my opinion tooSo my dear Eitherside do you and Plausible dispatch the business now as soon as possible  Serj Either  My Lord every thing will be ready for signing in less than an hour

frankly tell you that you work against my nature you would connect me with men I despise and press me into measures I abhor would make me a devoted slave to selfish leaders who have no friendship but in faction no merit but in corruption nor interest in any measure but their own and to such men I cannot submitFor know Sir that the malignant ferment which the venal ambition of the times provokes in
