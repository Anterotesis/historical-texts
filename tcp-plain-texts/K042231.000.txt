care and vexation  Shou'd want make his mistress too keen to dispute  Your smiles fill his pocketsand Madam is mute  Shou'd his wife that's himself for they two are but one  Be in hell that's in debt and the money all gone  Your favour brings comfort at once cures the evil  For 'scaping Bum Builiffs is 'scaping the devil  Nay  Cerberus▪ Criticks  their fury will drop  For such barking monsters your smiles are a sop  But how to explain what you most will require  That  Cows Sheep  and  Calves  shou'd dance after the lyre  Without your kind favour how scanty each meal  But with it comes dancing  Beef Mutton  and  Veal  For sing it or say it this truth we all see  Your applause will be ever  the true Beaume de Vie  FINIS
