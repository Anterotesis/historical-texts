 A POEM UPON THE DEATH of Her late Sacred Majesty Queen  ANNE  AND THE Most Happy and most Auspicious Accession Of his Sacred MAJESTY KING GEORGE To the Imperial CROWNS of  GREAT BRITAIN France  and  Ireland  With an Exhortation to all True  Britons  to Unity  Rege incolumi mens omnibus una est  Virg Georg l  By Mr DENNIS  LONDON  Printed by H MEERE and Sold by J BAKER at the  Black Boy  in  PaterNosterRow    Price Six Pence  ON THE DEATH of Queen ANNE And the ACCESSION of KING GEORGE TO THE Crowns of Great Britain c WITH AN Exhortation to all BRITONS to Unity  _THOSE  British  Bards appear to me to have sunk  Below the Majesty of  British  Verse  Who mortal Painters have vouchsaf'd t' invoke  T' assist them in their great Designs to paint  Britannia  's Woe when Royal  ANNE  expir'd  What mortal Painter can suffice Descend  Urania  Child of Memory and  Jove  O Goddess of Celestial Imag'ry  Queen of immortal Colours Deathless Strokes  And Graces that can charm the rudest Minds  Speaking thou paint'st with so Divine a Skill  That Gods and Men are ravish'd with the Draught  And when thou dictate'st to thy Godlike Sons  Thy Influence makes the Pen's immortal Draught  Victorious o'er the Pencil's dying Toil  Goddess descend then and inspire my Song  That it with native Majesty may rise  High as the sacred Spring from which it flows  That I may painting sing  Britannia  's Woe  In such a moving such a melting Strain  That with Concern the list'ning World may hear  And in the doleful deathless Chorus join  And for the greater Pomp of piercing Woe  Muse shew  Britannia  to her mournful Lyre  Lamenting all the Virtues of her QUEEN  All the great Actions of her wond'rous Reign  In which the Terrour of the  British  Arms  Was carry'd to  Germania  's horrid  Alps  Their Fame beyond the Ocean's farthest Waves  Then let her wring her late victorious Arms  And rend the Laurels from her sacred Hair  Muse paint her Woe accompany'd with Care  And black Mistrust and with tormenting Fear  Fear of false Friends Fear of her Factious Sons  Paint her in direful'st Consternations  Muse  In dismal'st Expectation of th' Approach  Of vile and murderous Idolatry  Of shameful Slavery and endless Woe  But short O Goddess be the mournful Draught  And short the Lamentation of the Song  For lo the wond'rous Hand of God appears  Now Muse begin a new and nobler Strain  Thy Colours vary and thy Shadows change  Or let thy Draught like  Holbin  's be all Light  Draw what no mortal Painter e'er could draw  And shew  Britannia  passing in an Hour  From Fear to Hope to Joy to Extasy  T' immortal Extasy from killing Woe  For lo the wond'rous Hand of God appears  Britannia  's noblest Sons that had 'till now  Been for whole Ages into Factions rent  All in a Moment by a secret Force  Resistless seek their Common Country's Good  Unanimously Hearts and Hands they join  Unanimously with a noble Fire  Their rightful King the Royal  GEORGE  proclaim  Heark how the Air with Shouts of Joy resounds  With Acclamations of bless'd Multitudes  Heark how aloud with one Accord they cry  In Imitation of their Godlike Chiefs  Long live the Royal  GEORGE  long may he live  And happy may he reign Bless him ye Pow'rs  Show'r down your choicest Blessings on his Head  Blessings as numberless as those he brings  To happy  Britain  's Isle Waft him ye Winds  Ye Billows gently in his Passage rise  And gently in Obeisance to him fall  Let the calm Ocean recognize it's Lord  And land him safely on the longing Shore  But who can e'er th' impatient Longings paint  Of  Britons  all on Fire to see their King  See how at his Approach their Eyes Voice Hands  Th' unruly Transport of their Joy declare  An Entertainment worthier Majesty  And far more pleasing to the Monarch's Soul  Than all the pompous Pageantry of State  And vain Magnificence of dying Show  The low Obeisance and the prostrate Bows  That on all Hands obsequiously are paid  For these may flow from Traytors and from Focs  But these the Loyal Subjects humble Love  And cordial Joy declare And lo he comes  And with him brings  Britannia  's other Hope  Britannia  's other Hope the other Dread of  Gaul  Britannia  seems to see with ravish'd Eyes  Her Godlike  Edward  and his conq'ring Son  After three Centuries return from Heav'n  To execute the vast Designs of Fate  Heark how the Air sounds with redoubl'd Shouts  And all the Welkin rings with vast Acclaim  While the shrill Trumpets with their Silver Sounds  Inspire a martial and heroick Joy  And our deep Cannons formidable Roar  The Ruler of the World's Vicegerent Thunder  Bears the transporting Tidings to the Skies  Where Angels louder Hallelujah's sing  And all the Spirits of the blest rejoyce  Chiefly the Souls of the triumphant Slain  Who dy'd to compass this Auspicious Day  In  Blenheim  and  Ramellia  's deathless Fields  With Godlike  William  at their Head once more  For he who dying to great  Marlborough  's Care  Consign'd themhere Himself commands them there  He Men and Angels in transporting Joy  Surpasses to behold this sacred Day  William  's each Action and his ev'ry Thought  All the long Labours of his anxious Days  And all the restless Slumbers of his Nights  Were destin'd to secure this Sacred Day  His daily Image and his nightly Dream  For this Great  William  liv'd and reign'd and dy'd  But whither Muse do'st thou transported rove  Immortal Child of  Memory  and  Jove  Return to his Vicegerent here below  And to the King thy Eyes and Thoughts confine  On whom the Eyes of Gods and Men are fix'd  Behold him well with thy immortal Eyes  That thou may'st paint him to the gazing World  Paint him with native Majesty adorn'd  But heightned with a thousand great Exploits  Perform'd upon  Pannonia  's wondring Plains  Where he for twenty Years victorious fought  Against the Foe of all the Christian World  E'en then the Great  Defender of the Faith  And Champion of th' Almighty under him  Spotless Religion will be still secure  In Spite of all the Attacks of  Rome  and Hell  Muse Paint no Terrour on his Regal Brow  But Love and Majesty together blend  And let him look a King resolv'd to rule  Over his Subject's Hearts Ev'n God himself  The Almighty Ruler of the Universe  Remains unsatisfy'd with all his Pow'r  Unless he has the Hearts of those he rules  Terrestrial Rulers his Vicegerents call'd  If they o'er senseless Matter only reign  Are but Dramatick Kings to rule o'er Souls  Over intelligent immortal Beings  Is true Dominion true Imperial Sway  Muse paint the King a Monarch not by Halves  But let him reign o'er all his Subjects Hearts  A King who reigns by Parties is a King  Only of half his Subjects and the Lord  Who has th' Affections of the other half  Is truly King of that Let Royal  GEORGE  Possess them all let him deserve them all  By his just gentle and impartial Sway  And that the King may rule o'er all our Hearts  Grant him Thou God of Concord and of Love  Grant him the Glory to unite those Hearts  Heal our Divisions and our Factions calm  And as thy great creating Pow'r at first  From warring Elements compos'd the World  So from our jarring Factions may the King  Form an harmonious and a glorious State  That  Britain  like thy Heav'n serene within  May send its Light'ning and its Thunder forth  T'affright and punish an offending World  Daughter of  Jove  Mother of Harmony  Exhort thy  Britains  to fraternal Love  'Tis our Divisions that have made us weak  And to the Nations scandalously vile  But mutual Love will make us once more strong  With neighbouring Nations will retrieve our Fame  And place the Ballance of the Christian Pow'r  In Royal  GEORGE  's formidable Arm  Unite then  Britains  join both Hearts and Hands  The barbarous Distinction of vile Names  For ever be remov'd be  Britons  all  And look with Indignation and Disdain  On the vile Artifices that had Pow'r  To divide those whom Heaven and Nature meant  When it disjoin'd us from the rest of Men  Should be within our selves for ever one  The true  Britannick  Tory and Church Whig  Names that debase the Majesty of Verse  Odious Distinctions mean but the same Thing  A King by Law from doing Harm restrain'd  But boundless in his Pow'r of doing Good  Over all Persons o'er all Things supream  Except Superior and Imperial Law  A People free and rul'd by Laws they make  Proud to be Subjects scorning to be Slaves  A Church in its own Excellence secure  Abhorring Violence abhorring Blood  And mean Mistrusts and vain fantastick Fears  Relying firmly on establish'd Law  And Promises Divine which have decreed  That all the Rage of Earth and Rage of Hell  Against its Sacred Pow'r shall ne'er prevail  The true  Britannick  Tory and Church Whig  Mean nought but this and therefore should be Friends  And the Dissenter from establish'd Rites  The sober scrupulous conscientious Man  In Principles political's the same  With both the other since they then all three  In Interest and Principle are one  Let them be three by barbarous Terms no more  But by Asfection one and one by Name  Let them all three be to each other true  As to the original Compact they are just  And to their Country's Constitution true  Let the Dissenter venerate the Church  And let the Church breathe nought but Heav'nly Love  Towards those who differ from her Sacred Rites  As surely knowing nothing can create  Danger to her but Want of Love Divine  For those who quarrel with our Country's Laws  And with our Frame of Government for those  Who would be too much bound or too much free  Those let us now endeavour to reclaim  Since they were born our Brethren and our Friends  Then let the few of old Republicks fond  Know that our Manners profligately vile  Can ne'er consist with Democratick Sway  That they require the Curb of Regal Pow'r  Tho' justly we tyrannick Rule disdain  Ye Wretches who desire unbounded Sway  Would ye be govern'd well or govern'd ill  What Fool what Brute would not be govern'd well  Th'  Aesopian  Frogs when they desir'd a King  One active and benificent requir'd  And all the sounding Bog whom Instinct taught  The Right which Nature gave with one Accord  Depos'd the lumpish useless lifeless Log  And croak'd to Heav'n for Help from the devouring Crane  Now view the Earth from  London  to  Japan  Take a Survey of its most boundless Lords  Let it be Sultan Sophy Czar Mogul  Whoever governs well he rules by Law  By written or eternal Law he rules  The Law promulgated in human Hearts  Ev'n the great Ruler of the Universe  Governs by written or eternal Law  And none he favours and chastises none  But for observing or transgressing Law  But in hereditary Realms how few  Are qualify'd to rule by Reason's Law  Perhaps not four in ten successive Kings  The rest must govern then by stated Rule  Or they must govern ill  Whoe'er in Realms hereditary then  Declare for boundless Pow'r and boundless Kings  They for ill Government in Terms declare  And are to all their Fellow Subjects Foes  And Traytors to their Kings for stated Law  Which alone makes the Safety of the Rul'd  Makes the sole firm Security of Kings  And never Prince in Kingdoms rul'd by Law  While Law prevail'd by freeborn Subjects fell  But thousands where unbounded Pow'r prevail'd  Have fall'n by their own  nonresisting Slaves  While  feeble Principle  to  Nature's Pow'r  Gave Way and  passive  canting Doctrines fail'd  As  Roman  and as  Turkish  Records tell  Where Slaves upon unbounded Lords depend  Upon those Slaves th' unbounded Lords depend  Let him then who for boundless Pow'r declares  Either recant or own himself a Foe  To Prince to People and to human Kind  And if he dares to own himself that Foe  Let him by Prince by People and Mankind  An universal Outlaw be proclaim'd  And like devoted noxious Creatures us'd  But if repenting he desires a King  A King the just Executor of Law  Instead of an unjust and baleful Tyrant  The bloody Executioner of Will  By that Desire he Royal  GEORGE  demands  For none of all our Regal Race but he  Dares rule by written or eternal Law  For one in  Romish  Superstition bred  And disciplin'd to barbarous Tyranny  Will scorn all Bounds and make his Pow'r his Law  But Royal  GEORGE  ev'n in his native Realm  Where he was less restrain'd by written Law  Yet there with Justice and with Mercy rul'd  His comprehensive Reason was his Law  To his hereditary Subjects dear  The common tender Father of them all  Who his Departure for  Britannia  saw  With the same Grief and the same Horror struck  That Wretches left on  Greenland  's horrid Strand  See the Departure of the Lord of Day  Th' exhaustless Source of Warmth and Life and Light  With Joy ye  Britons  under such a King  Unite and grow indissolubly firm  To the two ancient Kingdoms of our Isle  James I  James  gave one Monarch  Anna  gave one Law  For  GEORGE  the happier Union is reserv'd  The Union of Affections and of Hearts  That Union makes both King and People blest  Makes him the greatest most renown'd of Kings  And us a People worthy such a King  Goddess to whom 'tis giv'n by Fate and  Jove  To bring back what is past the present to record  The future to foresee and to unite  Whate'er has been and is and what shall be  Let thy loud  Britons  see with ravish'd Souls  What wond'rous Blessings will on  Britain  flow  Under the King united to itself  While he with Justice and with Mercy rules  With Plenty we and Liberty obey  That Union in the King will place a Pow'r  A formidable but a legal Pow'r  On which our Western Tyrants will look pale  And all his Subjects look with chearful Hue  For he with the same awful bounteous Voice  With which he sets to each proud Tyrant Bars  And says as God does to the Ocean's Waves  Here fix thy Bounds here stop thy aspiring Course  Will make fair Liberty immortal here  Will make his Subjects blest secure renown'd  Woe to that guilty Tyrant who shall then  Provoke him to resume the dreadful Sword  To lead his  Britons  and his  Germans  forth  To meet bright Victory on  Belgian  Plains  Where they have oft the radiant Goddess met  Where oft the radiant Goddess has been pleas'd  To bless and crown the Union of their Arms  What Vengeance will that impious Tyrant urge  What hideous and amazing Ruin draw  On his accursed and devoted Head  In vain he shall new Fortresses erect  As Gyants Mountains upon Mountains hurl'd  To threat Religion and assail the Skies  The King like  Jove  shall crumble them to Dust  With his avenging Thunder and his Son  As once he did on  Audenard  's wond'ring Plains  Shall like the God of War among them rush  While Dread before him and Amazement march  And Slaughter and Destruction stalk behind  What numerous Triumphs shall we then behold  Upon the Land upon th' astonish'd Main  Again Great  Marlborough  to the  German Alps  With old victorious Squadrons shall be sent  The  German Alps  shall tremble at his March  And from their Summits shake th' eternal Snow  Another deathless  Blenheim  shall be fought  And in its Field another Emperor sav'd  Another glorious  Ramellies  succeed  And fifty Forts and Provinces entire  Which Perfidy and Fraud and impious Gold  Could scarce in fifty guilty Years acquire  Shall in one Hour before the Conqueror fall  Orford  once more Great  Neptune  shall affright  And make him apprehend as at  La Hogue  That  Jove  's descended in Celestial Fire  T' exhaust and to devour his watry Realm  Our impious Foes shall from all Seas be driv'n  Nor shall the Ocean which confines the World  Britannia  's Fame and Victories confine  Both shall to new astonish'd Worlds extend  T' Imperial  Mexico  Montezuma  's Golden Coast  And  Peru  Atabalipa  's more precious Shore  And both th' Aetherial  Andes  shall ascend  Where on the Skies th' ambitious Earth confines  Britannia  's Victories and Fame like them  Shall reach the Stars and terminate in Heav'n  Our Ships shall o'er the  Atlantick  Ocean range  From  Florida  to the far Southern Cape  Where the two Seas their Names and Waves confound  In Triumph the pacifick Billows plough  From  California  to rich  Chili  's Shore  Shall captivate the Vessels of both Floods  Their Forts demolish and their Towns destroy  Ravage their  Carthagene  and  Porto Bell  And  Panama  and Royal  Lima  spoil  Confound the Hope of the aspiring  Gaul  And teach the proud  Castilian  humbler Thoughts  Return with the vast Treasure of the  West  And bring home Riches to amaze the World  Dreadful alas shall spread that War and wide  Infecting Sea and Land with Purple Die  But short shall be its transitory Rage  And it shall end in Victory and Fame  Eternal Fame to  Britain  and her King  And then a glorious everlasting Peace  Crown'd with domestick Quiet shall succeed  And brood o'er  Britain  with her downy Wings  To hatch Felicity and Plenty here  Then the wise Conduct of the best of Kings  Will shine and then his Godlike Bounty flow  The Rich with flowing Plenty will o'erwhelm  Employ and nourish our yet num'rous Poor  Our Manufactures will encrease and raise  Our Commerce will improve and will extend  And to our Side incline the pond'rous Scale  While he the Ocean's undisputed Lord  Will call Divine  Astrea  from the Skies  And causeher Sacred Laws to be observ'd  As strictly on the rude tempestuous Main  As they're observ'd on calm  Britannia  's Shore  As they're observ'd in her own native Heav'n  The Numbers of his Subjects he'll augment  Diminish'd much by three devouring Wars  Extend our Culture and improve our Soil  Will make the Ocean now the World's great Wast  It self a fertile and a bounteous Soil  While his bold  Britons  plough the furrow'd Deep  And reap a plentiful and living Harvest  At Home the Rich shall jocundly sit down  In the cool Shade of his own branching Vine  And with its Juice make his poor Brethren glad  But when this glorious long continu'd Peace  Shall advance Commerce to its utmost Height  Base Poverty and baser Passions then  For ever shall be banish'd from our Isle  The Riches of the Earth the Joys of Heav'n  Shall overflow  Britannia  's blissful Plains  The  Eastern  and the  Western  World shall vie  Which shall add most to our encreasing Store  The Merchant shall in sparkling Ruby drink  And under Golden Canopies shall sleep  And balmy shall his Slumbers be and long  The happy Shepherd with his rural Crook  Shall the dumb Kingdom under him survey  And while his Heart distends with Pride and Joy  Shall see his wanton and his fat'ning Flock  The Source of all his Country's Wealth and Pow'r▪  Under their pond'rous Fleeces proudly pant  While numberless and cov'ring all the Plain  To the shrill Musick of his jocund Pipe  Under his ravish'd Eye they still encrease  And hourly multiply The whistling Hind  Shall sow the faithful Glebe with sanguine Hope  Large Interest to extort for what he lends  And for mild Seasons and a gentle Reign  Shall praise aloud the Goodness of the King  And the indulgent Clemency of Heav'n  Fair Liberty shall like the  British  Oak  The long liv'd Oak grow tall and branching spread  And Virtue under Liberty grow strong  For ever Property shall be secure  The Publick Credit be forever fix'd  The buisy  Britons  like industrious Bees  Shall drive the idle Drones from forth their Hives  And Idleness be deem'd the Source of ev'ry Vice  Pernicious Luxury shall be restrain'd  By wholesom and by sumptuary Laws  That none his Patrimonial Lands may waste  And so by dire Necessity be urg'd  To sell his Country and his King betray  Unmanly Customs and contagious Vice  And Fraud beyond the Ocean shall be driv'n  And Faith and ev'ry Virtue dwell secure  Devotion to the Heav'n of Heav'ns shall soar  Upon the flaming Wings of Charity  And fall again in Blessings on Mankind  While vile Mistrust and vain fantastick Fear  And Envy Hatred Malice Rage Revenge  Shall take their Flight to Tyrants Courts Abroad  Or take their Flight to Hell and plague the Damn'd  No Passion but the Heav'nborn Passion Love  Among  Britannia  's happy Sons shall reign  No Passion here but Love shall reign and Joy  The lawful and the charming Child of Love  Each noble Art shall flourish as in Days  Of Great  Augustus  or Great  Alexander  Goddess to Thee a Temple we'll erect  And annual Honours shall be paid To thee  Peace owes its noblest Ornaments To thee  Distinguish'd Merit owes its chief Reward  And Vertues self its Immortality  Thy tuneful Sons their Raptures shall employ  To celebrate the Blessings and the Joys  Of this renown'd and everlasting Peace▪  Thy noblest Sons their Transports shall employ  Vertue and publick Spirit to advance  And great and publick Actions to record  And to reward with everlasting Fame  T' extol the Godlike Patriot to the Skies  To fix on Traytors an eternal Brand  And on the venal vile accursed Pens  That with their Lies intoxicate the Crowd  And make the Beasts run dangerously mad  While from immortal Merit they detract  Heroick Victories heroick Deeds  To which its Happiness their Country owes  Its Safety Spirit Strength and high Renown  On these a Brand eternal shall be fix'd  Eternal Lawrels on our Heroes Heads  A different Hero to each Godlike Bard  And a peculiar Province shall be given  But their heroick Transports all shall join  Redouble all their Raptures and their Flames  To celebrate the King's auspicious Reign  And his immortal Name t' extend as far  As his high Conduct brave and just and wise  Will fair  Britannia  's Happiness extend  FINIS
